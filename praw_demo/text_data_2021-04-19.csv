0,2021-04-19,"  I’ve gotten first shot big Fauci fan last year, impressed last month so. Let’s educate people vaccine (why get it, get it) put real incentives behind getting it. example, let’s say “for last week X percent people got covid vaccine percent people died covid vaccine. get Z percent people vaccinated, remove restrictions.” 
I understand it’s easy, can’t think anything he’s done publicly recently getting people vaccinated. cases, false positives Australia would far high.

Nothing 100%.  community cases right now, tested 25 million random Aussies, specificity 99%, that’s 250,000 false positives.

We’d need test 99.9999% specificity.  Even exist, can’t statistically prove figure without hundreds millions tests.  don’t bother, 10,000 tests claim 99% specificity. It’s economically worth manufacturer push prove ridiculously high level 99% good enough nearly country.  heard indian government trying get that. Hopefully get it.   teens kids getting vaccinated? I’m legit curious agree almost said, cannot imagine place manufacture meaningfully helped NH reach high numbers. simple reason: cannot imagine noteworthy number people would skeptical taking vaccine would also know Moderna's vaccine made locally. Ill wait till next year

No rush get since im immune anyway    No, East Texas naturally forested. Lots humidity, worse lots wind breaks.

I’ve camped East Texas summer, hoped would rain would cool off, got rain, oh realized mistake humidity rose even higher.

Every depression around Dallas filled water called lake multiyear droughts come (it humid *still* rain), evaporation pushes humidity. I’ve seen hot enough rapid transit trains run slow rails softening heat, lakes pushing humidity air.

And see comment Houston built swamp. lived 5 years. It’s usually quite hot, it’s much humid it’s even uncomfortable. lol yeah id say 90% replies gotten removed cuz swear lot. im used subs giving shit (oops- prolly get pulled too) 

its pretty annoying Why? antibodies now. America great vaccinations, meanwhile Europe dropped ball. F.e. 6% Belgians got full vaccination. current rate lucky receive first injection end June somewhere July...   soon harder data vaccinated people significant transmission vector, really reason keep vaccinated people locked down. Thank you. Invisible Women (read book can!) view is, - take whatever available you’re lucky option accept statistically similar result choose yourself. means choose take logically reasonable route it. isn’t without risks already seen small ignorable risk blood clots J&amp;J. he’s still in, I’m still in.  Free, even don’t insurance.  see, totally wacky, *Canada absolutely dismal vaccine supply.* Thus, forced take alternative measures. “Effort” means nothing manufacturing infrastructure completely reliant imports. Thank you! actually get antibody tested came back positive values. pcp didn’t want order reason, he’s weird entire pandemic, paid pocket.

But even without antibody test, know body definitely produced antibodies kind got absolutely rocked second dose lol  So, compared vaccinated Americans contracted Covid, numbers lower? Meaning, getting Covid offer protection vaccine. BTW, realize duration protection unknown point, vaccine caught it. concerned response vaccine, could try find get titer checked. Stop listening foolish heavily China/Russian backed propaganda trying divide us. 

As opposed home grown American propaganda dividing us! Also, there’s still risk vaccinated people reach herd immunity - might one unlucky vaccine didn’t work.

Yet citizens corporations hanging every word say like credibility. fully vaccinated. housemate covid past 5ish days. feel vaccine working symptoms really feel quite fine.

We separated masking house. trying understand body handling this.

Do antibodies continually fight ""long term"" exposure body making more, run get overwhelmed? certain amount virus become much antibodies I'm exposed say day virus particles next week? pretty much clear long keep isolating masking.

I'm trying understand body handling this. Fauci? though? Canada wrong? Alaska handing shots like free candy numerous communities 50% vaccinated.

What po-dunk redneck state like Alaska right entire nation Canada can’t figure out? mean vaccines effective numbers we've given? 6,000 infections insanely tiny fraction number infections been. think entire population vaccine test group... even though nonvaccinated/""placebo"" group several times larger vaccinated group (not much longer, definitely average period time) 6000 like fraction 1% number infections period time.

I guess could also skewed vaccinated people tending get tested think able catch it. guess trust science done. 6k small number though. want appear weak. Vaccines weak people, know?

Karma? Sounds like new age hippie crap. Around parts say Lord works mysterious ways. underrated part - logically people inclined put efficacy vaccine test, beyond might done vaccine trial conditions. NYT piece ""Irrational COVID Fears"" really got folks tizzy. frequent another forum number outright denials safety post vaccinated country could get back normal dizzying. fair, folks lost ones knew COVID, least honest ""I care odds are"" mentality, recognizing might logical way think.

Still, number folks think things like 90% efficacy means 10% chance infection ""Wait, could still transmit even vaccination!"" takes shaking head.

I understand nature science one careful evaluation declaration, even caveats ""we certain"", really push back ""little nothing changes vaccine"" narrative that's set in. end stalling 55-60% vaccinated hedging bets much well vaccines work, that's really better alternative ""reckless"".

I’ll admit I’ve living life pretty much normal since September, including restaurants bars, etc (florida). regularly tested, got positive test (and symptoms) December (and quarantined), tested positive antibodies January got vaccinated 2 weeks ago anyway. 

I say clearly past 2 months, things accelerating people ignoring masks distancing rules. 

If going use lever “take vaccine go back normal”, limited time majority unvaccinated people treat rules like people treat speed limits. 

Imho month away 50% population completely DGAF mode far restrictions go. Maybe half vaccinated. Remember reporting delays started giving J&amp;J vaccines? We’re probably seeing reverse. risk mutually exclusive. According CDC US had:

* 776 COVID deaths women ages 18–29
* 2,062 COVID deaths women ages 30–39
* 5,491 COVID deaths women ages 40–49 (one original six reported cases 48-year-old woman)

I believe two cases reported older woman man well. Even look lowest-risk age group, women ages 18–29, we’re talking 776 COVID deaths counting; 25 million women category Right it’s believed Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine caused one death due blood clots million people received (although it’s certainly possible cases turn up), means would expect 3.6 vaccine deaths every woman age 18–29 received vaccine vs. hundreds hundreds COVID deaths.

And remember, one’s forcing anyone get vaccine, particular vaccine (the issue vaccine passports aside)…what FDA ban *anyone* receiving it, even doctor aware risks. Meanwhile still go buy pack cigarettes, know certain harmful health. Well hold now, still America...

His problem guns stupidity idiocy users people general. injuries sees related kids taking guns parents thinking hard issues mishandling guns (he refuses call accidents could prevented via education actions, disagree with, yeah).

I think also privately wants promote culture shift supports gun safety. thought banning guns would solve problems, would probably support it. doesn’t think would fix things else wants kids stop getting hurt.

In terms liberal, it’s economic social relating strict gun control like Trump said. really said that! confirm. 16. times, super understanding efficient looked away time admit it, don’t care people die. im glad Trump enacting OWS

and im glad Biden effective distribution know planned far ahead. think mainly Japan want money invested Olympics go waste, they're hosting matter point. lucky man. September course Europe's fault bringing light. too! Lets hang bars people roommates get it, test comes back negative? convince people get think like that? said happened? state page 1st shot fully vaccinated well. I’m hoping state page lagging bit behind. Good good good crazy. operating risk less 0.0005%. Stop gas lighting people restricting lives someone know ridiculously improbable. 

And top that, it’s *still* following CDC guidelines. evidently vehemently against. Disagree CDC guidelines helps sleep night, least grow accept pandemic ending. Take note folks, convince truly hesitant people. 

Not shouting them, judging them, shaming them, calling stupid burying info. good example, offer outlook personal reasoning, judge help come around eventually.

Kudos dude. Congrats getting lives back! world mocked US entire pandemic incorrectly thinking mitigation could stop pandemic. US went vaccine turned absolute right decision, US's fault????

I hate bothers much can't help Right, (almost) nowhere did, that's mean.

The reason we've told bars need shut down, example, even though vulnerable people could choose go, people get infected bars still going infect vulnerable they're essential things (even masks). we're going say yes crowded bars clubs still require masks grocery stores.

Now, obvious vaccines make huge difference, really mixed message. Either vaccines stop transmission great enough degree clubs bars safe (this one true one), case masks grocery stores make sense, don't, case opening make sense. What’s going India COVID started spiral control? know mutant variant, seems like got worse sudden. one's Pennsylvania. see lot downvotes comment, must've antivaxxers got angry  Deleted comment since realized talking another thing. Let's start over. China country providing vaccines large quantities, secure long term diplomatic gains. instance, manage install 5g Brazil that's short term gain. That's long term. Paraguay breaking relations Taiwan.

It seems clear countries would rather that, choice. US starts providing vaccines large quantities US counter Chinese diplomatic pressure, even gain influence region. 

That point trying make. problem anti-maskers take free license completely stop wearing masks nobody able call it.

I care less. Everyone wants protection soon exception children risk trivial par flu. see you’d say really know people. TBH I’m concerned ones aren’t talking getting shot all. Agreed, vaccines work. takeaway “yahooo return bars concerts church weddings mask lots hugs” thinking zero chance serious illness death. remain cautious follow guidelines genuinely safe (and slow birth variants).   S'all good bro, here's natural selection. sentiment post contradicts criticism Fauci one post I'm 'take give me' train. holding specific vaccine. Issues like bloodclots rare (1 million) compare bloodclots birth control, even better number. vaccine better vaccine. Doesn’t Ontario 2,100 positive cases per 100,000? That’s worse anywhere I’ve heard US. Lmao still it. Well, going ice cream groceries yesterday, lo behold every single person still wearing mask. New Hampshire educated anyways.

Also good point. people legitimately cannot receive vaccination, historically herd immunity protected them.

I'm little surprised saddened negativity towards comments receiving vaccine like flipping switch back normal still good idea practice caution. suspect trolls / brigaders, whatever - still stand point.

We're paying like 5 bucks one churro already. charge $10 1 stoners pay up. make Gluten free ones charge $15  think driving dangerous less it. something useful compare things probably number 1 risk mindlessly engage in. 

My point Covid risks specifically applying vaccinated people. risks them, especially younger, healthy, vaccinated people low. Like orders magnitude less driving. tons backround risks face everyday, dwelling many needlessly considered anxiety. 

At point, move resume normal lives full social interaction. Maybe point right taking steps direction healthy. social creatures things cannot stay way forever. Avoiding something statistically extremely low risk risk happens Covid irrational. worried vaccinated person hanging around vaccinated people irrational.  know think really smart, modern medicine around blink eye. Sometimes good, alot times bad, really bad. 

The MNRA vaccines MIGHT safe, dont know. scientist says 100% liar. idea. INITIAL studies show fine, initial studies show many things safe realize not. 

The J/J vaccine uses proven methods delivery, dare say takes effort time produce.  hopeful J/J would take care dont want deal side effects 2nd shot or, 'odd' side effects people reporting rarely gets reported like short term paralysis.  Short term, obvious ..long term what?  J/J blood clotting could symptom people underlying issue. mean let's face it, Americans world general arent specimens health. much larger horizontally, much less active computers/tv/games, things foods making us REALLY sick.

A piece bread 20 years ago would mold 3 days. piece bread today takes several weeks.  That's chemical retarding/killing mold. ingesting it. FDA says 'it's safe' test small amount per year, reality types chemicals foods. 

Tangent know, make point. FDA clueless many big food worked vice versa. CDC. make best judgement realize big omnipotent entity making us 'safe'. people went school sniffing glue picking nose eating it. super heroes like everyone wants believe. India because, people stopped caring around Dec 2020. precautions followed. March end, 2nd wave increased infections exponentially. accelerated blatant ignorance people follow precautions. Sounds sexual That's 43 counties (not 43%), they're 43 counties vastly rural, people live there. three four biggest cities start declining shipments, meaningful. Nothing return normal. I’m tired white lies. Vaccines cause death rate go enough encourage people. going places, still able get covid spread it. That’s facts world fire, unless talking climate change, orders magnitude severe pandemic. We're year in, death toll less 2x normal, average year tuberculosis. certainly bad, goodness sake let's keep perspective. explain clickbait? challenging you, curious. hard time variants understanding concerned. news makes sound like end world, sub seems feel confident vaccines/direction we’re going towards normal ignorant thing say. first question: way choose either Pfizer Moderna would appointment websites happen show one administered make appointment. Anecdotally, state's health department website (GA) this. walk-up, get get.

No second question, far know there's serious discussion making mandatory. think birth control also causing low platelets, they? Biden made national lockdown December everyone getting vaccinated could save lives. done could save lives. digress possible many EU countries people 50 use it, right still vaccinating 60s and, time finish start younger people, mRNA vaccines may available. sure. IMO, I'd take J&amp;J offered it. help getting rid pandemic moving forward herd immunity. benefit 3% adults America immunosuppressed. keep telling people this, also keep forgetting selfish stupid lot people are. family members, friends, colleagues. vaccine ineffective (possibly partially effective) them. No. I’m asking people carefully craft language. encourage others receive vaccine things return normal. Otherwise won’t get called tokes pokes Yeah like traumatizing watch 600,000 people die millions countrymen scream fake, big deal, ""freedoms"" important.

We've spent last year gaslit, fear gaslighting going get worse next years decade vocal minority US insist never big deal. got first dose already, need schedule second, thing would different state time I'm supposed get it, would lot easier able get second dose somewhere else instead go back home get it. Good. Send vaccines parts state people actually want them. You’re invalidating everyone though choosing cautious even vaccines. There’s thing “overly” cautious 580,000 died far number still going supply soon exceed demand, unfortunately I'm Canadian. I'm pointing countries struggled compliance too. accurate paint American phenomenon. 

Rising cases ""compliant"" countries forces acceptance one two conclusions: either people compliant we're led believe, compliance effective promised.  Major thanks India, Brazil think. India crossed 200k cases per day. still increasing. Anecdotally, least one megasite area (ATL GA) started walk-ups week  account shady Supposedly treatable keep mind US law dictates effective treatment FDA cannot approve vaccine. whole send people home without sort treatment always rubbed wrong way given deadly contagious supposed be. 

I'm doctor basic understanding biology pretty sketchy take I'm saying someone tried gain basic layman's understanding. I'm also Covid denier. think real think shit ton money vaccines effective treatments would derail that. also understanding Pharma companies used influence keep nicotine reduction implemented tobacco products past couple decades order keep people smoking. even touch role opioid epidemic US FDA looked way decade realized problem. call cynical. 

Ivermetrin anti-viral even sub-reddit. lot skeptical first thinking trying plug stock. However, I've seen doctor doctor pushing early treatment judge Wisconsin even ordered hospital continue treatment seemingly terminal patient showed surprising results two treatments. give reason quit family took court get continue. 

Nicotine, following pretty closely last year following anecdotal evidence France smokers four times less likely hospitalize Covid non-smokers. five studies around world including giving front line workers nicotine patches. idea nicotine protein attaches receptors Covid virus blocks ability replicate. Several latest vaccines yet hit market manufactured using tobacco plants order reproduce large quantities certain protein. earth? sure turned ad hominem. I’m sorry loss truly. want things improve much anyone quickest path begging people get vaccinated. attacking internet Canadians slightly hypocritical complaining first line okay letting rest world wait. 

This absolute strawman. That’s Reddit sounds lot like what's happening Chile instead invitation age, could definitely say idk chronic disease get I'm waiting bc I'm 26 years old, masks definitely used socially speaking that's rule us, vaccination indeed taking time now, months cases steadily going quite aggressive spike summer vacations patience key. I'm bored... days definitely going quite hardly lately knowing vaccination places already showing signs normal life. tricky thing now. poverty taking big toll security general, sense fear outside idk... we'll need much mental health awareness globe ASAP. Amen. excuses. Get vaccine adult put absolutely minuscule risk might catch spread covid vaccination context 2731728373 risks take every single day. driving car eating things like burgers ice cream things regularly (I both, judgement either), still worried covid risk mass vaccination, rational covid risk. feel like due flu variants always break Asia culturally accepted wear mask. wearing mask US 2019 people would look like weirdo. think that's case Asia.  Finland; restaurants take-away bars closed, opened Monday restrictions.

No stores ordered close point. gave vulnerable people first.  Sorry truly. I'm surprised, thought Canada compliance. believe, even good vaccine distribution, America woods yet, variants becoming dominant many people refusing vaccinate. sympathise frustration slow process, many lives stake. Godspeed vaccinations. spray with? I’ve washing produce (stuff eat raw, anyway) white vinegar  Anyone best guesses travel US Europe allowed again? I'm hoping book trip Italy October so, fiancée fully vaccinated within couple weeks. going graphic pictures well? Honestly, since vax sites trouble filling enough appointments use doses they've given, I'd try walk-up even happen different state time being. “Overly” cautious. “Negative” mindset. bet you’re person tells wife/husband they’re “over dramatic” mental break  think important. people it'll help go get vaccinated get something free. article data CDC caught eye: breakthrough infections 7% hospitalized 1% died. higher hospitalization rate unvaccinated cohort.

Does mean get symptomatic covid vaccination, vaccine nothing protect hospitalization death? fact higher chance hospitalized.

What missing? Surely, logic faulty somewhere 3 million world-wide. that's chicago entirely gone. armenia. jamaica. fucking wild. I'll drink bro Statistically speaking, chances dying cardiovascular disease much, much higher COVID vaccinated. There's evidence immunity vaccination longer-lasting natural infection. 2/3rds Canadians supplemental insurance healthcare actually free cover everything. average Canadian spends $6600 taxes healthcare coverage - far us pay. Prescription medicines free Canada either. many misconceptions. claim EU countries put restrictions based political interests. conspiracy theory - that's - completely shattered non-EU countries, including UK itself, put similar age restrictions place. impossible know errors administering vaccine small number people too. Perhaps got smaller dose recommended something done incorrectly injection. 

A lot study needed deaths still occur. Technically legal distribute yet, nobody cares seriously say “you may fib” nah sick white lies dude. Covid kills people dude. Like vaccines don’t last forever new variants evolving everyday especially people caring masks vaccines. concerned “negative” it’s cautious. absolutely nothing wrong that. aunt died this. trust issues now. Choosing go saves people. fact, wish country could locked back December. aunt wold alive today. making joke, although realized username fits, let’s say joined chimps forest.

So it’s like they’re bad regard all. I've things throughout this. Outdoor socially distanced concerts movies, soccer matches... capacity going up, etc despite vaccinated myself, know like quarter people are, too, thoughts indoor stuff overly crowded outdoor stuff anxiety inducing. thought lot this, especially intense constant anxiety whole year. think re-entry thing different everyone, remembering things re-entering NORMAL. normal part. got fully vaccinated anxiety plummeted course weeks. Even small fully vaccinated situations (ie seeing also fully vaccinated mom last month) thought I'd still feel anxious went away. think lasting impacts mental health, sure, think lot people drop anxiety quicker think. Maybe [lieing infection death believe vaccine efficiency data? definitely better since people afford medicine prescribed. Millions Americans can't even afford prescriptions. 

There point ""better"" health care rich people afford it. ... there's thing called pun. think misleading, [Pfizer least, COVID-deaths vaccine group *nor* placebo group. Also, ""95% efficacy rate"" Pfizer vaccine refers *relative* risk reduction absolute risk reduction.

Among approximately 37,000 subjects least 2 months follow up, 170 confirmed COVID-19 (8 vaccine group; 162 placebo group). represents infection rates 0.04% 0.88% respectively, *relative* efficacy words confirmed infections occurred placebo group. absolute difference groups 0.84%, thus vaccine prevented one COVID-19 infection every 119 people vaccinated. Pfizer study test asymptomatic people, enough severe cases COVID study population (there 4 severe cases *total*) determine efficacy vaccine preventing cases severe disease.

I think important read deeper study results get better idea findings actually mean. media rarely goes deeply data, unfortunately. Also, several [methodological Pfizer study could potentially compromise findings. Yet, Pfizer stated would releasing raw data [24 months study completion. written me? They’re mad cuz would like believe 😂  Always makes wary renting apt complex last go-round those.

Man amazing! Meanwhile, Germany, still eligible get vaccine 70 (AstraZeneca 60s) qualified precondition true. don’t know enough confident Might well prepack sell small markup.

You gonna buy churros 3 $5? China absolutely could give vaccines day US, matter fact would expect to. claim trust claim made Chinese government completely insane.

Mistrust Chinese Russian Governments well placed. defending profits pharmaceutical industry? idea vaccines going highest bidder? course. got moderna next day felt like worse flu ever. Waves nausea, zero appetite, zero energy, vertigo, arm red puffy 10 days. I'm mid 20's, healthy, active, medical conditions. sounds like would one gets really fucked virus, I'll take single sick day weeks months machine breathe feel like slowly dying... mean, california definitely running either doses administered increasing since eligibility opened up. states boat, states opposite end spectrum. read article small clinic rural county asked stop getting vaccines fridge full nobody wanted get vaccinated right, getting close moot. month now, might well assume everyone wants gotten it. get it, oh well, that's you. get second shot, yes please. Tho barely concerts scheduled yet. Dude extrapolating ""never take mask ever daughter never see eachother's face(paraphrased)"" trying normalize mask wearing public obviously bad faith c'mon...

Are going argue face masks effective slowing spread common cold flu? we're going get anywhere argument child; ""No dont wanna""... good one chief. Excited two weeks second shot Wednesday! I'm leaning towards hoping there's new variant screws things Yep. That's intrinsic irony here. previous diseases, disease crushing hospitals killing thousands daily, shit exist again. 

Even decide businesses trump number lives saved here, vaccines masks help accomplish both. unlike lockdowns, restrict freedom either. concert question end July I'll two weeks second shot Wednesday. Agreed though, biggest thing going actually able relax  Sounds great I’m going take news St. Petersburg sized grain salt. Dude, understand. think risks, (I first shot last week) moderate fever feeling like truck hit day, LOT better dying covid. I'm medications, interactions (and wouldn't... take vaccines every day interact covid shot) means concerted effort involving literal thousands black Americans former president neighborhood pharmacists nurses slowly chipped away mistrust century making. thought olympics even years? Like 2020 2022. one 2021, especially pandemic?  Hopefully caucus right thing remove someone ability listen reason. 100% vaccines 99.99% effective though taking away severe lethal symptoms vaccinated, important factor. following CDC guidelines? getting colds unless interacting people outside household. Knocked ass overatates good bit, 2nd easy without sides. seems like would need super cheap useful. Add Israel small tiny population

Ireland even smaller, nowhere near vaccination rate Israel. Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, etc either. Size population alone account success. NHS makes big difference. willingness everyone get first doses first. vaccines going network cities, states, tribes, pharmacies, etc. doubt list anywhere seniors.

That percentage seniors want here. He's lost credibility people business judging credibility! one cited scientist science! say ""part ways"" issue among qualified speak laughable. got shot promote others Fauci needs go away. People don’t trust him. hadn’t thought military bases. That’s good, workable, solution. doubt want military personnel vaccinated, they’ve probably already figured distribution logistics get vaccines stuff. Embassies, too, they’d almost certainly figured get people working vaccinated. every embassy send email mailing list vaccine sign ups figure roughly many send, it. countries easier others, guarantee government already sorted getting military personnel ambassadors staff vaccinated. put little effort let American citizens get vaccinated.

Honestly, people make huge fuss DC Puerto Rico statehood representation, completely ignore Americans living abroad. Yeah, technically get representatives Congress based last place lived US, representatives don’t give two shits unique set issues Americans abroad face, never going start thinking legislation affects them. shit like constant issue. Americans abroad DC Puerto Rico combined, Congress consistently neglects consider unique issues face. Puerto Rico DC considered statehood, maybe least Americans abroad could get non-voting representatives Congress way PR DC currently. Even without vote, would amazing somebody constantly remind representatives think policy going affect millions Americans. can't say ignore much higher chance dying clot AZ vs mRNA, also saying need pay attention also miniscule chance dying covid couple week timespan.

Yes can, especially much much much likely, we're ignoring rest impacts COVID. someome get vaccine right (either 55+ chronic disease) getting COVID pretty likely bad news form even die.

1/1000 people dying disease terrifying number, several magnitudes likelyhood hurt AZ vaccine, magnitudes less likely dying many things vaccine snobs lives. can't blame ridiculously overly careful, sure blame inconsistency one decision could end hurting short term hurt society's immunity whole.

I mean lady physically come pharmacy today ask vaccine carried risk clots something. know, pharmacy? place sick people go? idea calling us instead cross mind. Coming pharmacy is, again, much likely result catching COVID dying. People get numbers.

A lot happen weeks pandemic. handful people COULD AZ vaccine decided wait die, fact. I'm certain number higher people die vaccine. god knows want shoes overflowing regret... think going spotty, heard immunity places others. Vaccines well enough protecting people non heard immunity areas. death among vaccinated, tragic, tame compared become used to.  organized religion actually opposes vaccination, aside fringe religions allow medical intervention type.  


And actual kind religious exemption would withstand scrutiny. someone claiming religious exemption can't display actually stance religion, valid. Something can't do, unless literally inventing religion. happened J&amp;J. Took days subside. Anecdotally also heard different people. happened past viruses - that's true - remember much larger fraction population simply died viruses - exclusively evolution virus, we've evolved tolerate/fight viruses well (see impact Europeans arriving Americas). thanks, could worded differently maybe, hopefully info subject revealed next weeks. Got second Pfizer shot today! ✅  sounds like something I'd later summer. get emotional concerts, think going hard relax kind mind space big public spaces. I'll work way that. way want to. worried lasting forever all. 396 Correct they're assholes would stop assholes? President Trump predicted. Probably common definition knowledge justified true belief. case Trump making assertion, belief true, justified given facts time. state something true without justification, that's lie.

So yes, lucked right. also way know whether right, makes statement equivalent lying. fifth tiny amount,  


I'm sure I'd agree. UK less vaccines guys (or shortly), yet 95% age 50 least 1 dose vaccine, compared 80% USA. 


Why matter, well difference 20% unvaccinated 5% unvaccinated risk groups quite large, see UK currently 5 times less deaths per capita per day minute, large part due higher vaccination rates older people far important aspect vaccination campaign. pharmacies doctor offices, lot fifth slowly vaccinated.  


But question groups targeted start with, older people overwhelmingly ones risk virus. public health officials going list seniors, sending letters, calling up, going around house ect. give jab. younger tech savvy people able outbook older people jab. public health perspective job reach seniors way around.

It seems like chaos. also agree idea targetting seniors effectively slow rollout, UK proof done effectively speed. really fucking annoying left implying may safe Trump making rush it. seems like people supported ones absolutely getting it’s cold anyways. Really message Trump basically created vaccine best vaccine ever created hopefully get supporters take it. 

Let’s forget Lebron perfect chance tell everyone get vaccine choosing say it’s private matter. Even plan get it, told everyone need get well. Biden administration's vaccine distribution plan involves both. narrative! Canadian too, WANT VACCINE. young ish, multiple autoimmune diseases ""essential"". Can't even register. US either work vacation, still get shot? people Covid got knocked ass first shot, second? you’re planning fully vaccinated say go it. Unvaccinated, maybe cases lower Probably common definition knowledge justified true belief. case Trump making assertion, belief true, justified given facts time. state something true without justification, that's lie.

So yes, lucked right. also way know whether right, makes statement equivalent lying. case people familiar reporting structure specific country. Otherwise might thinking 1 person died COVID-19 yesterday, that's all. dashboard gives views though, useful - deaths reporting date, also deaths date actually happened on.  Hell no! explain Texas lower numbers ever stopping lockdowns mask mandates? LOL Tryna drag everyone else smh Russia shady since Ivan Terrible.  one year Im grateful Easter full month normal Easter read study? There’s good reasons Worst first less 4 months. 

Meanwhile Japan talkin’ ‘bout “It maybe February 2022 vaccinate general population” they’re [still trying 

Pray us. vaccine even fda approved? Share link anti vaxxers argue with. Quick!! change mind mean, Israel getting rid *outdoor* mask mandate (though they've always bit heavier restrictions us first place). assume high vaccination always mean restrictions. Oral Polio Vaccine cause paralysis. live virus afterall... Still incredibly small risk, ""practice"" anyone. side effects, like medication. Wild Polio killed far hundred thousand, assure you... company holds hour-long emergency meeting discuss large number simultaneous call-outs caused huge production drop reiterates company policy 48-hour notice absence illness threatens disciplinary action possible violate including loss bonus, loss vacation time, termination. make sure tell HR manager next time plan catch flu schedule someone place, okay?

Followed another meeting week later discuss productivity drop last week looked like nothing done hour reason. much talk around water cooler, maybe? Slow return work breaks? Managers start keeping eye things note employee annual reviews, maybe start distributing pee bottles, too. It’s vaccines 100% effective contracting virus post vaccine. nothing mishandling. left hand turned Zune I'm ok it. actually threshold set this? article says capacity limits removed though right?

Also “everyone vaccinated” even mean?

Strange feel confident lifting capacity limits certain date plan whatsoever, even target metric, actually lifting restrictions, including mask mandates. Doesn’t sound like data-driven approach youngest kid 15 turn 16 mid-July. keep wondering arrive first, birthday, approval 12 15 year olds... CDC?

[During March 1–December 31, 2020, state-issued mask mandates applied 2,313 (73.6%) 3,142 U.S. counties. Mask mandates associated 0.5 percentage point decrease (p = 0.02) daily COVID-19 case growth rates 1–20 days implementation decreases 1.1, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8 percentage points 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, 81–100 days, respectively, implementation (p&lt;0.01 all) (Table 1) (Figure). Mask mandates associated 0.7 percentage point decrease (p = 0.03) daily COVID-19 death growth rates 1–20 days implementation decreases 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, 1.9 percentage points 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, 81–100 days, respectively, implementation (p&lt;0.01 all). Daily case death growth rates implementation mask mandates statistically different reference transmission rates decreased max 1.8% max mandates. many 6,000 needed hospitalized? think we're running people want it, think we're running people willing schedule appointment. every CVS, Walgreens, Walmart across country offering dose every single person walks in, think we'd getting doses waiting people schedule appointments. lot people consider pressing matter even they'd happy get vaccine. reason incentivize tested STDs. It’s public health concern.  officials willing say vaccinated people need wear masks

The problem anti-maskers take free license completely stop wearing masks nobody able call it. wave blamed. 

Yes, that's one reason want metrics. leadership position, accepting responsibility blame things go wrong. want act interests, go private sector. Try responding substance argued article rather resorting ad hominem point unlucky vac job! says becomes less deadly? Yes, happened viruses appears B117 variants actually virulent. Yeah, get it. Like... Even hate CTH make *wrong* observation. Going get poked tomorrow VA. case anyone UK know, order rapid tests free government website. seems silly. Would Pfizer/Moderna/AZ even effective four month wait period doses? seems like major botch me. way many people think concepts like herd immunity defined feelings instead data.

Asking metrics pretty much opposite ""feelings instead data."" New York bars still closed? went university literally called Evangel hahahahaha Unless come knocking door offer complimentary ice cream cone hand job, I’m gonna bothered go wait 6 hour line virus I’m even least bit concerned They’re still post, vaccine worked 3-4 year olds go preschool.

I 4 6 year old going suck one vaccinated nearish future, even neither get school starts (which likely, depending fast emergency authorizations go.) Yes, point cases low every person vaccinated one less vector still like idea littlest family member one without vaccine.

I care risks serious illness low kids, still want either getting sick something easily preventable possibly unknown effects later result. 

But I'm sure fall far fewer remote school options. We've fine remote school mind continuing think going table area come fall. 

So annoying keep everyone around us safe getting sick year everyone turn around say ""fuck it, that's good enough, we're anymore"" adults get vaccinated, little kids protected. kids fine, won't. want whole family vaccinated ASAP. I'd imagine cases hopefully mild lesser cases too, I'd read report I'm work Plus I'd imagine now, people fully vaccinated necessarily taking many precautions. certainly changed behavior since vaccinated. cowards even genocide mosquitos end malaria even though technology. government try supply everyone N95 masks 2 way protection.  I'm saying that. least work bars open capacity limits clubs probably everyone vaccinated point they'll probably bring vaccine passport system. I’d ignore polls October. Back October, trump threatening fire head FDA didn’t approve vaccine early (before election). rational skeptical happened.  Seriously, gotten publicly first tier available him. Me, too. vaccine would never go dates beautiful women, would browse Reddit toilet. looking forward putting 2014-2020 behind now. New variants likely infect younger people. UK variant P1 variants quicker infect number reasons (some due genetic structure, due people less risk averse). wasted tens milions.

I even touched millions wasted adding stupid anti-climate change stickers gas stations, money wasted fighting federal government climate change, attempt bulldozing little greenspace Toronto has, decision suddenly cut # Toronto councillors half, etc etc.

He utterly garbage human being. Starting next week 1M biontech per week 4 weeks another 1.7M per week, double next month. best wear something like gas mask Hazmat helmet allow wearers breathe easy, rather copying kidnap victims. Well shucks article stated 74 deaths breakthrough cases due COVID. Hospital acquired covid death alternative injury/illness would likely therefore count towards 74. Perhaps mistaken, also sure understand suggesting. deaths (74) miscategorized “Covid related” point finding real ones aren’t hard. saw Walmart homedepot day. ones valves put piece tape it. exclaimed “HA!” really loud house 6:45AM reading this. 🤞🏼 I’m glad keeping mask requirements personally wouldn’t go inside crowded place. really think capacity limits mask requirements place reach 1% test positivity. Zero chance spreading zero covid thing. We've eliminated diseases, haven't, groups people vaccinating. vaccines effective have, worldwide effort, absolutely possible eliminate covid, though tend think inequities world mean never happens. think it'll either end seasonal endemic, close gone, depending various factors including idiocy people living countries well capable eliminating community spread locally, refusing get vacines. significantly reduce unknown risk actually achieve robust local herd immunity. Wow! write bullshit recommending n99 ffp3 mask much better solution. mention person might employee forced supervise clean. got tons downvotes actual anti science nerd calling dumb got tons upvotes. pandemic made people paranoid freaks psychos, you’re accused bad faith suggest there’s loud minority wants things stay forever keep mind many n95 fake, buy ones earloops, go headband. wife WFH year. ever truly need go office. told week return May 31 full time office work. wife test negative PCR tests rapid tests? wear n95s point. Stop trying build protection never rival something meltblown charged fabric. $3.50 each. Google Bonafidasks Every article I've read says they're going advisory committee, since initial approval. FDA said tweak already approved EUA, going advisory committee again. Going gym requires masks distancing well things like reserving spots temp checks entry vaccinated low risk overall benefit mental health outweighs small chance catching covid Based elderly vaccinated group, likely deaths group. yes almost 65 + multiple issues could also kill them. High blood pressure isnt called silent killer nothing. quoted paper. Everything talking paper says. post see person gatekeeping whether people opinions. Yes, zero covid impossible, like zero measles zero whooping cough. last time heard someone dying them? That's goal. Sucks suck I’m fighting confirm opinion… facts side you. Sure thing bud. yet link CDC website quoted from. Still waiting.

But keep screaming confirmation bias. Facts facts, kids get sick spread like adults. They're magical creatures can't spread virus. 'bout weather, eh? Pascal Soriot

Prison? many lives lost this. Surely corporate manslaughter. That’s true, little risk spread. Sounds significantly less risky sending child school, fine with.

Probably damaging health keep young kid isolated rest world year. Imagine mindset car crash fatalities. Statistically FAR danger driving street eating restaurant post-vaccination. We'd shut streets applied ideas driving. stockholm syndrome That's definitely good news. It’s messaging. seems people want spoon fed information rather spend 5 minutes reading vaccines work protect us. 74 died millions gotten vaccine, less 1% far important masks. Wearing mask minor nuisance businesses closed limited capacity really impacts me. Wait wtf, 72. wait long? Lol medical literature says vaccines effective variants, even slightly reduced rate. There’s plenty examples mass outdoor gatherings resulting zero uptick cases spread (remember protests?). Preventing children playing outdoors year psychotic shit—but comment variants suggests don’t live real world anyways absolutely 100% disagree.  

In beginning sure numbers suck far accuracy. mobilize visible way there’s outbreak it’s hard hide what’s happening country citizens regardless put state media.  talk eachother like gossip tree. go really pull stops. close whole cities throw literally 4 million tests it. send people mandatory quarantine stations, 

I 3 friends China last person knew even Covid last spring.  one Covid scare student school taught September shut tested half school (nothing positive).  really aggressive population largely cooperative really effective combo.

Russia hand done nothing mitigationwise since June. point trust Chinas numbers way way Russia. 

China shady sure think cracked Covid code willing keep suppressed. friends country say it’s like normal [Moderna COVID vaccine could receive emergency authorization children ages 12 15 within I'm saying want suffer die would Reddit TOS I'm saying would throw biggest part I've ever entire life happen, cause would totally bad thing do, saying I'm pricing different services event become necessary near (hopefully) future. would great. AZ's best reasonable efforts accomplish production rate based best case scenarios production factories. 

Drug substance brought US achieve 30M doses, 10 million delivered last day March. world, ""best case scenario"", Leiden Seneffe plant supposed manufacture 100M doses, own, Q1? 300M end June?

Honestly, lengths willing go defend AZ hard understand. Without seeing patient info hard know, old people die lots things. see people come lots reasons. foot literally rotting happen asymptomatic COVID + hit ER doors. died bacterial infection also happened mild COVID infection. 74 deaths may along lines. consolation pain went ;) People done 6-12 times already bet ass management find someway yank everyone back in. Safety damned them. actually spent bit time thinking philosophical level. 
Basically, interesting little bit liquid w/suspended particles able bind body’s cells go crazy process. 
If mankind doesn’t kill next hundred years, cannot even begin imagine kinds things able pull off. I'm making correction. nothing ""get over"" live real world! Someone said something true, think stupid people walk around wrong idea. I'm telling people information, I'm going go world I'm fully vaccinated, one anything ""gEt OvEr"" - grow up. risk small? Yes, small. wild west anyone telling know something sure telling ""get over"" something dumb ass. dont' spread REAL knowledge information take care other? Damn, informed 21st century get shot. anything expect Ted Nugent ...no guy even relevant anymore.. mild case 10 days symptoms didnt go hospital. Received 2nd dose Pfizer yesterday. Felt nothing slightly sore arm 1st one. arm definitely sore 2nd dose I’m really tired morning achy. took Tylenol I’m working home today. 100% worth getting vaccinated though. concerned, war gas/full face filtration Hazmat mask hazmat suit well, whilst also portable oxygen tanks strapped back. therefore allows breathe easy, whilst also blocking environmental pollutants, bacteria anything else like virus whatever.

For example, please consult practices specialist staff seen clad full Hazmat/environmental suits when, example investigating radiation leak visiting site nuclear point live-blogging status someone's Reddit comment? Upvotes literally matter, anyone vote up, changes time. negative view things. rest entire life COULD spread it. It'll never 100% CDC says youre 95% safe getting it..and get reduce much virus shed 90%. absolutely must live point, repeating still cautious vaccination can't go anywhere best way get fence get it.

""Why get vaccine nothing change?"" 

Tell people can't attend Florida Bama football game they'll get shot arm day. MUST encourage normalcy vaccinated never get fence. That's interesting always people mount effective immune response, despite administered injection- i.e. immune.


It took 3 vaccinations develop effective immune response measles adult, despite vaccinated child.  health problems. 

So perfectly healthy people, despite vaccinated immune. hope so. Maybe 4,6 mill doses total doses, receive 9,2. using seems like bunch appointments dropped randomly throughout day. Like yesterday 1:30pm saw dozens appointments Safeways around booked two kids. nothing else throughout day. Oh there’s still lots us tired kid glove approach lucky bleach injected hydroxychloroquine great supply!  


/s (so get suspended again) risk microscopic, get think numbers wrong, Norway get 6 million doses Pfizer last update order. Norway get bit 1% EU total 600M assume Denmark get slightly eventually. I'm pro vaccine. 
You hit nail head think Cool story bro Plenty places even lockdown seemingly even here, flu. weird IMO. virus done many things many people, stressed supply chains, ruined economies, strained families...

But me, hideous thing done remove ability compassionate 'these' people... Saw anti-vaxx meme FB stupid hurts. Bill Gates Fauci car mechanics (bad Photoshop) caption something effect of, ""Your car problem fine 99% time. mechanic wants try experimental gas could destroy engine... would do?"". Like painfully flawed many ways. I’m fighting confirm opinion… facts side you. came me.

Ok bud. never present info aside writing ssn form. think it’s super easy anybody People can't look know I'm vaccinated, still wear mask I'm about. Yep, know couple people wrecked. 
The 90% people knew basically fine aside sore arm / mild fatigue / malaise. It’s even stupidity — it’s stubborn refusal act like decent human being. speaking experience around me. 
Out probably 20 people immediate circle, half mild symptoms, two felt like absolute crap, rest felt nothing all. 
To anyone fence getting it, I’ve course suggested do, open know two people experienced full range terrible symptoms, albeit 24 hours. 6,000 fully vaccinated people still managed get Covid.  translates 99.5% reduction risk. that's good, still without risk. 

And new variants pop up, risk increase ineffective vaccination. mean…. Maybe. 

But you’re random dude internet basing gut feeling, offense, I’m gonna go data gigantic organizations massive manpower collect. perfect? No. trustworthy single dude internet “feels” like it’s wishful thinking? bet is. Ah shit, talking disinformation political ought remove whole thread. Either infected prior. Regardless, given body recover, even serious medical intervention, wondering underlying health conditions played factor. flu symptoms last ten days. thought dying. clusterfuck. “I tested positive today. got Chinese shit. I’ve got stuffed head, body God, pain ass. literally could hardly crawl bed last days… officially tested positive COVID-19 today.” promised ""best reasonable efforts"" produce deliver 100M doses Q1 two factories never capacity accomplish it. AZ course knew given contracts partner companies much lower quantities needed fulfill EU contract.

So AZ's best reasonable efforts accomplish production rate based best case scenarios production factories. happen, AZ warned possible. accusing of, then? Besides, would take anything comes politico big pinch salt J&amp;J Moderna, date failed quarterly delivery targets EU.

They certainly UK countries lol. say lot things like masks work sick people. amazing people easily believe things. still get covid outside close people. look what's happening Brazil India. think going hace another big wave anticipating. vaccines little help p variant winter warmer summer lot European countries! Yep, that's understood well. clear guy disingenuous spreading false info. look post history. pure crazy, anti-science stuff. War drugs specifically drafted republicans incarcerate socialists black people. Still well? 
I felt pretty bad day 2 shot #2. 
I still able get active third day shot. Lol realize dont time that. That’s literally problem. problem jump bunch hoops. worth it. avoided surprisingly long Anyone says covid spread school heads ass. School germ factories best time they're like parents they'll minimum caution wearing masks required going eat inside restaurants multiple times per week visiting elderly friends family none vaccinated either despite part first age groups eligible. true pretty much eradicated:

The data checked official İsrael web 50k tests 129 new case, 7 day average 149. One month ago average 1224. 

Sever cases drop 500 187 month. 

So maybe cases death rate much lower flue season. keep covering ugly mug ignore one prestigious medical schools study.  

Keep stupid things appear virtuous :/ agree degree, ""both sides"" belief black people human beings, rich people pay fair share taxes, healthcare/child care, expensive, insurrection capitol bad. certain ""disagreements"" one side clearly wrong 👍 Charles Darwin likes true. studies conducted differently, people considered fully vaccinated one J&amp;J dose, 1 Pfizer Moderna dose. I’ve read, second dose Pfizer Moderna necessary shouldn’t missed. It’s unknown protection first dose would wane without second dose. get second shots, people!

I’ve also read Fauci said one dose Pfizer Moderna, pretend like hasn’t happened. You’re good go two weeks second dose. goes long feeling bad doesn’t go hospital though? vaccine, got covid instead felt way day would heading there. Oh shit really??? fucking fast

But vaccinate, faster we'll outta mess wish knew. Reading comments... People celebrate sickness others wish death upon weird. “This ain’t bad time caught super syphilis ‘89!” Minds think alike disease enough warrant that, it’s contagious, allowed spread unchecked, hospital system country could cope numbers people would infected. chance. wrong whole life, doubt sees light late stage idiotic life.  sad part survives, going like nothing. fuck Ted Nugent Yeah, think intelligent racist. find funny type economic views liked Trump. falling pr campaign since initially approved emergency use. think smarter are... constantly manipulated, yet think control. countries US travel list? find news articles list updated specifics. fully vaccinated really hoping see family UK year :/ assholes like caused US become completely dysfunctional country. adds va prefix.

Know science step off. came cat stretch fever comments. heads up, 12-15 probably eligible within 5-10 weeks. Pfizer already submitted EUA. covid targeting people think exist take zero precautions prevent spread? Scotland japan top list places visit haven’t been. probably get Scotland first. Thoughts bears. that's makes president. Everyone different. went 1st Pfizer shot w/ someone felt ill call work next day. felt mildly fatigued hungry evening, it. 

I think second dose Pfizer pronounced side-effects people, I'm remembering correctly - order reversed Moderna. Sorry medical community considers mild survived without needing medical attention. hear people covid mild symptoms include people like bed ridden days. IRS making things complicated be, requiring citizens working living abroad file taxes IRS.

I know many countries require citizens report incomes earned inside said country. fair, simplifies things everyone, IRS we're talking here. problem idiots survive get refueled bad virus, cycle continues Jesus Christ! dead yet? half US hates half blocks progress.

Psh, everyone knows really Sittingbourne variant. think guys sound like Depeche Mode? someone username call stupidity someone else says something. lowiqvoter guy sure troll dumb June/July funny roseanne apparently like socialist also. There's drawer bedside table. Put next butt plugs. Lol woooow, 0.4%. well researched &amp; articulated referring mrna vaccines. would expect viral vectors article address J&amp;J, AZ non mrna vaccines.



With said would expect initial immune response boils strong immune system is. older age groups lower rates reported side effects. vaccine even systems weak it'll take longer mount defence. Oh man chuckled Ok admit skeptical Sputnik first been. can't believe that. Must severe COVID something. would effective mRNA vaccines?

But yeah wow Russians done well this(was quoted Lancet safe effective 92%). viral vector vaccine likely better others. effective AZ J&amp;J reports blood clots yet. SC =( show formula use. surprised unfortunately. cousin vaccinated got 13. Mumps immunity great known problem Well, Netherlands expecting large delivery May: UK likely excluded. poor nations can’t afford vaccines have, spread like US weeks ago targeted. show formula use. Pretty much understand. Even catch vaccinated, much likely mild case. Maybe exactly 'sniffles sleep off' almost definitely gonna end ventilator. huge pile vaccines ready delivered EU

Do source this? don´t trust you, remember hearing AZ and/or Pfizer late 2020, turned big lie. ""Push political agenda""? talking Ford? thing want see pushed good government pandemic response, determined party. I'm province Conservative government absolutely crushed it. tend align right myself, although could brought vote Ford lived there. made incompetence blindingly obvious many years ago, anyone able look past party colours. think interpretation evidence better medical professionals whose job literally is? articles never explain serious symptoms people are? Oh No! Anyway initial commitment Q1 100M doses, later revised 40M doses. ended delivering 30M doses. 

By end June, deliver 100M doses, third initially committed deliver six-month period. 

Those facts. AZ vaccine also recommended groups! EU really need AZ vaccine, need J&amp;J one. going pretty awful sadly. Complete failure. Spoiler:

Benefits outweigh risks massive margin, recommended ages

Spoiler 2: 

Different EU countries put different restrictions vaccine according political interests 99% use cause one dose vaccine speed vaccination lot, especially month June summer. countries Pfizer doses like Denmark think using Worst case, might see one ""mini wave"" ripple states lag most. Granted, place like Wyoming lags vaccination also pretty sparsely populated, community spread could mitigated fact.

completely lost sense smell, taste still there. Waiting test results morning... wonder I’m one rare breakthrough infections, fuck. Broooooo again? Yeah, politics aside people way likely want get vaccinated drive far it. Anyone drive 30 minutes likely would really question worth it. wouldn’t valid test, test % infected per capita use entire base assume people living general lives, you’re talking trials they’ve already done earlier date, around reducing mortality trials. sign up? may another option you. I'd gone HMO even first shot yet. articles topic, breakthrough infections even full immunity reached. bluntly, vaccine 100%. always breakthrough infections, result hospitalizations, result deaths. However, vaccine makes percentages vanishingly small. reality vaccine, safe enough people it, Covid stops serious threat worry time. W possible distribution ramp developed country like Japan get vaccines circulated prior Olympics great! Thanks explanation. Considering demographic breakdown gotten vaccine hasn't, likely skews older.

You've got like 17% 20 30 somethings vaccinated, like 80% 75+ year olds. I've heard government advice flip-floppy asthma GP surgeries whatever. taking people asthma, not, ever hospitalised. GP flat refusing vaccinate asthma patients says need wait age bracket eligible. think friend got lucky. advisory committee meeting scheduled *after* FDA reviewers satisfied data major questions answered sponsor (drug company). 

This meeting date set. cannot done advance: issues/questions arise, addressed, takes extra time.

The meeting review, serves double-check results FDA review panel outside experts. Sometimes experts disagree raise new issues, rare.

If wish meeting date set *before* FDA review complete, allowing extra time discuss address issues. means either going committee flawed data (and FDA+experts agreeing approve), insufficient review rubber-stamping. seriously want that?  quite, point many people lung condition told big deal need wait age bracket vaccinated, underlying condition considered underlying condition.

[This little old now, explains going on. tried register vaccine NHS site many times turned away. GP too. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Maybe. Report VAERS. enough vacccines available Japanese public?  current pace, shitting say california theoretically vaccinate 100% population june 15th, vaccinating many people per day. thats newsoms june 15th date actually conservative estimate, realistically speaking, since impossible get 100%, hit peak may 70% vaccinated. would surprised newsom pushes reopening date may then, many people vaccinated cases deaths would low levels. yea, 2 months bit conservative, right liberal, sometime may probably right answer Israel definitely come long way fast vaccination helping contain Covid-19 situation. 

 However, Israel (9million population) still new cases new deaths compared Singapore plus Hong Kong combined (12 million population both). Singapore Hong Kong consider Covid-19 eradicated. Gotta people immunocompromised something know comorbidities something. There's zero long-term data Covid vaccines

Yeah, that's pretty much really thing worry about.

Vaccines pretty tiny doses, used day so.

There's really much ""long term effect"" cram there, especially super, super minimalist vaccines like mRNA ones.

My minor biology. Obviously I'm doctor, know, maybe one come idea can't, can't think **potential** side effects four fats, four salts, mRNA payload Pfizer vaccine could cause say, five years road.

Like literally cannot think possible mechanism action. even number assumes everyone fully vaccinated came contact someone COVID, 100% case. denominator lower. say like crazy low anything, can't say like 80 year old grandma still left house getting vaccine precaution test positive vaccinated.   things true. find anything indicating link hypoglycemia vaccines. contrary, looks like likely high sugar sick. 

I'd put weekly check survey thing see follow you. 

I also worry specifically would keep eye studies time passes would start monitoring blood sugar

I'm expert this... trying rational help. Remind harder sexually harass women six feet away he'll whole damn state open tomorrow mean someone gives government benefit doubt trust good. Historically government always used crisis advantage way another. 

There massive wealth transfer going ppl rich fine ppl poor semi locked down. TSA still exists 9/11 despite us enough documentation know security theatre. Patriot act another strong arm response crisis. Lots things exist. 

I think government wants get everything back open eventually exactly 'bleed' general population always masked semi locked-downed. Ppl working non white collar places ones financially bleed. Dieting alone cause that, especially change intake quickly - swinging back hard way hard probably indicator take things gradually. I've low blood sugar diet, that's kind trying do, least side effect. denying recent injection could catalyst, probably shake system. Wow thank links. could case immune response triggered vaccine? Slightly ill disingenuous. I've talked plenty people got ass handed days. vaccine cut cardio 1/10th normally nearly week. realize poorly going make feel got gym, struggling breathe, started pouring sweat almost immediately. time made home, slightly ill. Nauseous point get fluids back me. said, still think smart get others to. think say ""slightly ill"" convince it. feel nothing, sore arm, slightly ill, absolutely shitty. like me, thanking getting feeling shitty days instead worse weeks (or worse still).  ""Like salad dressing, but.... reason want eat it"". OH GOD YES! I'm going renew passport next year embassy three four hour train ride live one cares North Germany. I'm going take fun little weekend trip Berlin refuse use ancient banking practices.  Oh see. thought meant sacrifice specifically parents rather general. think means touching healed. 135,000,000 vaccinated. 6,000 infected comes .004% vaccinated confirmed infected far.

That's amazing even short time period. Medical Hypotheses describes Hypotheses publish papers describe theories, ideas great deal observational support hypotheses experimental support yet Hypotheses therefore launched, still exists today, give novel, radical new ideas speculations medicine open-minded consideration, opening field radical hypotheses would rejected conventional journals. Papers Medical Hypotheses take standard scientific form terms style, structure referencing. journal therefore constitutes bridge cutting-edge theory mainstream medical scientific communication, ideas must eventually enter critiqued tested observations.

In words, conventional, peer-reviewed journal. journal seems deliberately position place potentially controversial ideas, hold standard evidence journals do. basically place whacky theories still need tested. articles useful departure status quo, journal also criticized allowing host extremely ""non-mainstream"" articles, including AIDS-denialism, racism, various far-out ideas ( ) Ah wow interesting. Thank you! first time mRNA vaccines clinical trials

No it’s not. patent misinformation. Congratulations spreading idiocracy. Agreed, second shot fucked next day (got shot Saturday) girlfriend still recovering it. Hopefully she'll back 100% tomorrow. regret all, Sunday definitely felt like bad case flu. Fever, body aches, pretty severe fatigue. trouble walking steps apartment taking trash. Worse expecting definitely worth vacation window August. Hoping visit first time. May work given lockdowns/vaccine timeline etc, fingers crossed. never risk dying. seem advanced much last decade. aren’t many papers. seems like fringe scientific hypothesis compared decade ago. probably gonna promoted reason need wait second generation vaccine end June, since messaging since last year ""Zero risk acceptable!"" many tested asymptomatic infection? completely support people lying get vaccine.

We need many needles arms possible. open freely every adult US, able eradicate even faster.   He’s gonna vouch sinovac lmao remember source. believe read something along lines 25% people experience rise blood sugar levels first days second dose. sure self reported trial sure credible is. seems least enough people giving anecdotal reports warrant investigation. EXACTLY! That's exactly what's accompanying pandemic! 
qual·i·fi·er

a word phrase, especially adjective, used attribute quality another word, especially noun. know anything. 

My mom 65. Smoker, active healthy. 

She received first vaccine weeks ago great now.

Is able get back normal life? visit grandkids still goto school? get saying, Biden kicked things situation already prime improvement, think drama Trump would caused time. alone makes thankful president less quietly job without hindering success. thing thing first started saw asian countries getting masks started debate whether required masks. remember scientific societies distinctly advertising opposite effect fact masks actually less healthy non masks. Despite mask culture thing asian countries long time since went thru stuff before. 

Many articles also literally reported point everyone started wearing masks felt betrayed health representative opted lie even tho susceptible covid.

I get it. also means I'm less trusting advice coming entities. Many non anti vaxx ppl support mass vaccinations satisfied moving timeline mask mandates lockdowns. already lost card contact place administration. going almost full speed January 20 know protestant evangelical pretty large overlap. That’s hate damn term I’m referred one. it’s true it’s also people think is. Listen y'all sabotage Pfizer February (I qualified) achy 1st shot nothing 2nd. Got county health dept (Tx) efficient process. Texas governor removed mask mandate weeks ago.
 removed capacity limit businesses. Thank goodness also opened vaccinations 16 Countrt. You’re good man worries. I’m ready shite done I’m glad say part. Well half least thing thing first started saw asian countries getting masks started debate whether required masks. remember scientific societies distinctly advertising opposite effect fact masks actually less healthy non masks. Despite mask culture thing asian countries long time since went thru stuff before. 

Many articles also literally reported point everyone started wearing masks felt betrayed elected official opted lie even tho susceptible covid. One main reasons successful domestic travel ban happened right lunar new year holiday family reunion began. Thus, almost people across country, including work far away home remaining period year, staying family lockdown period, made much easier endure.

In fact, Chinese, experienced like extended lunar new year holidays, bad long infrastructures services still running smoothly. So, complaints, painful many people outside China thought would be.  Huh? California least. ToLD WoUlD NEvEr HaPPeN ApRiL... combination lack trust home-made vaccines lack sense urgency. 

And blame them? 

1) 4 years ago scandal faulty vaccines involving several major vaccine companies China. Lots Chinese still remember it. 

2) Believe not, China kill COVID-19 last April. 99.999999% Chinese living COVID-free life year now, wonder reasonable people feel like get vaccinated hurry. feel much ado nothing, waiting superior mRNA vaccines. (either Pfizer home-grown mRNA, available July) even vaccines made end. 100% efficiency looking got covid severe effects were. Zero hospitalizations deaths.  sympathies RR also jumped people really really hard spot parody idiotic conspiracy theorists they're begin people still get work 5? even thing? people know work least 7 8 pm (or 9 pm, 10 pm, 2 am). again, I'm sure many corporate attorneys, professors, bankers hang with. Different social circles friend! It’s different different people. study shows 50-80% efficacy first dose. second dose pushes 90%. feel it. watch sorts things, needle going in, way Jose. reminded Biden’s IG story morning. Got appointment already tomorrow. I'd interested breakdown 6,000 vaccine understanding correctly ?

I though could still contract Covid-19 vaccinated, difference severity smaller. even every student vaccinated still transmission Covid ? point obligating people vaccinated then, person take risk ? typed New Zealand definitely worth it, ""slightly ill"" one lucky side effect winners. It'll make bedridden 2-3 days. particularly rare side effect either important people know yes, might really suck.

And common second dose definitely happen first too. bad one first dose personally. Second one felt like got hour less sleep have. mind living coastal Italy. That'd pretty sweet. Damned do, damned don't.

We fail response we're idiots going prologue pandemic. 

We secure vaccines pump people fast enough completely 180 get us track one first countries completely pandemic suddenly we're greedy Understandable Maybe don’t want get fired? Actually, locals know work week. either working home office. sure hang people know busy go mall middle workday. Extremely rare, handful documented cases. Americans bad party destinations population poor women, like maybe Thailand/Philippines. important note well Americans travel generally wealthier open-minded don't.

My friends country live think Americans chill, attractive, wealthy, that's sampling bias. takes confidence, planning, money travel abroad, see people attributes. thing u explained better Fauci exchange Jim Jordan precisely issue.  agree many things says. problem promote her: implied feeling condescension contempt espouses disagree counterproductive makes world suck. really ignored nobody. Plenty locals walk mall week champ. pointing that’s you’re wrong claim DC mask anytime you’re outdoors mandate. don’t. people DC neighbors aren’t wearing mask outside. Lol. Take care. curious, read that? sources chance? Well there's reddit subs that's sole objective ""spur skepticism"" Fauci also supposed represent science. expected normal ppl ask scientists hard metrics. Saying know cases high really shitty answer even ppl industry let alone someone whose job represent communicate science public. ur scientist politician raising tone u comes horribly u decide play politics regard did. 

I support mass vaccination exchange major L vaccine. That's blatant lie.

Well 80% total doses we've secured used given time that's bound increase vaccines open season anyone 16+ 50 states. mean, people also get rare forms cancer like... 

I wonder start think common happens them. 

Just saying. 

However state estimate likely low. probably is. That's...not approach. considered upside terrible tipping culture! Hope business picks soon! fine Trump pushing it. several family members addicted CNN. I’m quite liberal hate cnn. People going get us killed. Oppositional Defiant Disorder persists adulthood, apparently. Ok well people hang mall probably tourists. That's residential area know locals hang there. people Georgetown, Cleveland Park, Woodley Park, Dupont, U Street wearing masks. clearly arguing sake arguing else spend lot time residential areas. going pick one sure Ellume one. rapid test authorized FDA couple months back high degree sensitivity home kit (over 90%). nearly accurate standard PCR test takes day 2 process. Pifizer one mRNA vaccines? give much stronger immune responses much robust real-life results. hospitals free Philippines. European countries stopped administering AstraZeneca vaccine others restricted use younger people. think reasonable yet either, fine keep together two weeks. Wear mask, get vaccine, really importantly, keep Disneyland restricted Californians now. importing variants reach 75% vaccination. June 15 definitely doable hold line little longer. say whose fault is. Donald Trump opened bloated fucking mouth, never would issue. Um...supply. Except blatant lie political reasons due supply shortages. seeing recommend two masks originally telling us cloth masks fine months back. Common sense would dictate protection u better early on. 

He seems like smart guy maybe he's greater good dude terrible communicating public made things political. No, vaccinations + masks probably are, community transmission negligible, mask mandates dropped.  lie, understood best practice time. science works. evolves. well, sorry, understand original comment judging votes many others either.

I'd love give everyone benefit doubt, many belligerent idiots internet(Especially concerning covid)that feels likely someone really fuckin idiot rather sarcastic making joke. Indian account complaining Chinese bots... nice three colleagues interact Delhi office, sick, one apparently hospital... realise things bad week ago.

The new variant appears transmissible, words seems spreads faster. think exponential growth action; high R rate, difference number cases one week next huge. 

The chart illustrates much faster current spike compared first wave: cases rising since early March suspect time government people less cautious due lived virus form year, promise vaccine, etc. seems like new controls/lockdowns imposed. couple weeks ago people holidaying. Combine lower caution new variant things took off. think going keep rising. already really bad sadly think get much much worse. guess prepare news cycle dominated happening India. hope I'm wrong. wait biden hires team vaccine ninjas sneak anti-vaxxers homes jab johnson &amp; johnson sleep Good luck! aren’t. Go mall day. You’ll see plenty locals without mask. You’re coming contact stranger long walking around you’re getting COVID passing someone sidewalk half second. Get board anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers. Want get back normal?! Want get Liberties back?! Stop listening foolish heavily China/Russian backed propaganda trying divide us. Rejoin united America. That’s one aspect covid I’ll definitely miss. Literally anything need get blamed covid way. here. ""Friends"" family damned. Anyone important phone number email really gave shit talk me, could ask family help. 

Best thing well. Well, know supposed make feel better, okay. Regarding math teacher, passed away January (covid related complications) I'm sure would loved talk someone pleasant disposition yours.  He's pedophile dude....  guy thinks called COVID-19 19th one wonders lock 18 viruses. know, discovered 2019...  think effect loss taste smell reverts get vaccine least tons problem unless mutates really bad. 

Yeah hope never deal Q idiot. one friend hesitating get vaccine even though one first think finally convinced get it. much effort though. say deserved die. said people die deliberately spread potentially deadly virus others, world becomes little bit safer. know, longer deliberately spread virus shit everyone's collective efforts contain he’s ignorant asswipe. tad ironic. he’s ignorant asswipe   Yeah he's rat fuck *in bill burr voice*

Ohhhh jeeezus....   way word. know least three people believed virus fake either almost died themself, lost loved one. sad that’s takes country people see they’re wrong. leopards eat face? study, 8 15k got infected. That's .04% .0004 x 100m = 40k [Two draft dodgers salute So, say Fauci divisive (in thread Fauci), someone else randomly chimes badgers admit leader actually divisive one get accused divisive? Makes sense. Well said. comment gave real ""Commander Ripper Dr Strangelove ranting precious bodily fluids"" vibe. Glad see shut down. One dude marginally associated Stanford make Stanford product.  


And hypothesis correct kind study pay attention to.  


It well cited, however, make sense true scientist dismiss hand. Necked around found out. looking [Pfizer study published FDA, tell, COVID-related deaths *either* placebo group vaccine group. So, one could also argue placebo equally effective (100%) preventing deaths vaccine (at least Pfizer study).

I looked vaccine trial data thought. know COVID-related deaths vaccine trials? Thanks! Couldn’t happened bigger douche.   He's irrelevant, pants shitting, chicken hawk, short eyes. Curious know, would consider Americans favorite tourists? direct level, could talk could transfer virus surfaces touching them, even need worry.

You realize fomite transmission basically 0 risk. CDC came said weeks ago.

Also, people vaccinated extraordinarily unlikely transmit virus unvaccinated. messaging activities post-vaccination dangerous, deter people edge getting vaccine getting it. They'll ask, ""people still shame going gym eating indoors restaurant even I'm vaccinated? What's point vaccine?""   mean, Twitter account never died seems plausible.  Halix plant initial output intended UK, 20M doses back towards end 2020, never happened due scaling issues time plant making 5M month December/January EU blocked output leaving EU. important detail *only* 5M month plant. 

This nothing change fact AstraZeneca must known September 2020 going minimum three months behind schedule would notable probability would able make delivery targets significant margin using facilities stated original contract. 

The fact go cap hand EU either informing likely delay delivery offering chance provide additional funds build plants mitigate shortfall could behaviour opens failure honour 'best effort' clause going ""whelp that's manage said we'd set up"" ignores could asked money set facilities like belatedly doing. They're first government contract go budget, they're even first vaccine manufacturer come short delivery pandemic. 

The fact AstraZeneca importing doses US EU sent loud warning alarms sounding within EU something EU production. arguments rights UK plants production served obfuscate real issue, fundamental production problem temporary delivery shortfall. 

For something important EU much tighter involvement every stage vaccines production start rather choosing act like customer waiting delivery. Yeah, would shut play.... post-celebrity celebrity. make headlines fore wretched all, right. COVID got stranglehold baby

[Because last week singling white groups different reasons hesitant going mind changed different methods. White evangelicals give flying fuck Obama say vaccine. He's speaking black people he's got much higher impact groups. There's nothing wrong acknowledging this.

The daily numbers published Rospotrebnadzor (and various sites use source) include deaths COVID main cause death PCR confirmed (basically, they're absolutely sure death due COVID), operative data.

Rosstat (the national statistics agency) started including COVID deaths stats monthly reports natural population movement (the reports freely available web-site), deaths grouped four categories: laboratory-confirmed COVID main cause death; COVID suspected main cause death confirmed (needs investigations); COVID confirmed main cause, instead significantly affecting existing conditions; person infected COVID neither main cause contributed existing conditions. isn’t happening here, though.

And pfizer's vaccine partially effective thin new strain.

And still masks soacial distancing.

So yeah tell wrong trying sensible earth.

Find something life internet brawls.

Had message pop would forgotten existence. everyone around guess. makes sense since much free time internet fights. they’ve shown effective repeatedly. People wearing masks Texas, it’s everyone abandoned them. idea wanted insurance information? wondering billed insurer administration something along lines. pharma companies selling vaccines cost lots countries? would withhold Canada price fixing they're profiting vaccines anyway? sure rampant spread overseas means mutations get imported here. vaccine driven global suppression really feasible given worldwide population young adults kids acting reservoir. Let alone logistical difficulties cryogenic transport storage mRNA based vaccines 3rd world. New variant, people stopped following covid protocols, tell personal experience mask usage dropped considerably, probably fear factor lowered significantly. Large gatherings allowed, Indian weddings hundreds (or thousands) guests, election rallies, religious gatherings. lot contributed massive crisis. Still, imo new variant main factor, couple states majority cases restrictions place others returned almost normal life minimal cases, perhaps new variant spread states. Movie good CGI suppose someone cared seeing big lizard big monkey slap other, would fine. However, really like either thought unusually dumb plot even monster movie. see possibility exchanging germs people put mouths either inch away something never wiped cleaned? able get last month due barely meeting BMI threshold. one asked anything besides email showing appointment confirmation picture ID make sure me. questions qualified (would HIPAA violation anyway). insurance one asked card (I think optional field website registered handy left blank). Please seek help, would hate lack empathy hurt someone else. empathy! think period vaccine first available population want distribute fast possible, difference 3 weeks 3 months doses make big difference, longer wait negligible impact protection, meanwhile give almost twice many people. approach would probably prevent lot illness deaths.

At point, like reached US, enough vaccine go around much urgency. India controlled. loosen controls soon? think ""wipe pandemic"" bit optimistic overall agree. places going get third wave happens, potential worst one yet. There's still reason lot people pessimistic, least next couple months.

We'll also seeing smaller covid-19 epidemics crop decades, complacency sets fewer people get yearly vaccine. entirely possible people urban centres experiencing temporary partial lockdowns several years future. Travel restrictions certain areas interruptions major international events also real possibility next several years. Excuse ignorance, not? think situation Florida...our numbers higher never really closed thanks vaccine, weather reasonable people wearing masks regardless, getting killed like Michigan now. Yet 3 ounces think animals entertainment, food, clothing, objects, keep happening. keep species near us risk well being. hope people would watch Earthlings Youtube understand better. Hey that's unfair. Rudy, people mayor?... Oh yeah... forgot 2016-2020 health anyone else’s health responsibility. Eat better exercise, take vaccine want. forget bugging rest us private health decisions. think vaccine free, otherwise everyone afford it, bit incentive/encouragement never bad thing. love fuckin city. scientist brave enough consider possibility masks mandates might effective? get reluctant anti-vax Ted Nugent types, they'll offer free high-capacity magazine dose. Unlike Snail Well 5800 people got covid 77 million vaccinated 0.007%. 1% those, 0.00007% 77 million, less 1 million, died 5 million hospitalized.

So get vaccine 1 million chance still catching covid dying. guessing people elderly health conditions. young healthy chances probably 1/100 1/1000 times less that, getting point hard measure, like 1 billion. Ok I've repeat (sadly): rural areas India hit harder reported. Lack healthcare access combined real lack post-mortem testing means many cases went unfound.

You also see evidence sandbagging even sub. day post high level cases India know posters blaming? Ramadan. millions Hindu's gathering washing distancing Ganges Kumbh Mela.

The problem happened Florida early on: report numbers ruling party (republicans) look good. Modi government still sandbagging, guarantee that, become harder harder hide. cases coming in... doctors PPE, weren’t even enforcing quarantines infected people coming high risk areas. Like #1 basic thing used fight plagues last 1500ish years

Actually testing quarantining people alone would negated extent needed so-called lockdowns. followed actual science instead engaging half measures safety theatre, could ""over Easter."" read breakthrough rate 0.008%. Sorry bad luck. every East Asian country though. pretty poor handling virus Asia well, mysteriously result disaster like Europe North America. Japan pretty much anything entire time, somehow low numbers anyway. Indonesia also supposedly bad response, lot outbreaks, per capita deaths still order lowest Western countries. 

I think still seem something unexplained Asian countries uniformly done well almost regardless policies were. obesity passports tied smartphone. Anyone BMI 30 allowed buy 600 calories food restaurant. like it, stay home. /s

Serious answer: CDC health experts treat obesity way we've treated COVID last year. least treat way we've treating smoking. Stop subsidizing high fructose corn syrup. Promote diet soda, unsweetened drinks, water alternative sugary sodas. Obesity public health crisis kill lifetimes pandemic. I've saying vaccine passports utterly useless international travel countries accept vaccines proof.

American universities, example, debating whether include non-FDA-approved vaccines proof vaccinations international students fall. fact, debating requiring students get FDA-approved vaccine even vaccinated already.  got vaccinated last month haven’t menstruated yet. I’m dude, still... would say, time frame may bit short, that's it. year shaking head eager people go get covid, feels good finally able agree statement ""There's little reason keep restrictions."" end May, people vaccinated ones that'd rather take chances covid, think keep lives shut keep getting wish. Pad time slow-movers reach full vaccination, we're good. good news r/collapse agree completely, fear things lasting them. pandemic prolonged people wrong thing eventually people need stop dictating future- unfortunately cases  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Anyways Texas Florida proving everyone wrong irony  think gaslighting key part sure. people spent year told many leaders control thousands people died, really blame entirely trusting it’s safer vaccinated? US factories also producing rest world shortly. US raw material capacity sufficient supply production sites inside outside US? suffer seasonal allergies? do, start getting congested stopped up, tinnitus always increases ton. I'm currently going due springtime allergies. top 10% uninsured, many sufficient health insurance? Exactly. “regular world” overrated many ways IMO. don’t want go back. want go forward direction greater balance freedom. I’m Philadelphia fuck you. Lastly, almost Canadian would trade health system US Heath system.

They might not, clearly better top half earners. think Canadians lot patriotism tied healthcare much emotional issue them. roommate developed tinnitus followed hearing loss one ear. Doc prescribed antivirals steroids hearing improved. test positive COVID symptoms. Tinnitus hearing loss came back couple months later diagnosed stress diet related. virus going continue ravage stupid. this... Precedented? UK either. set government task force, paid companies cost building production facilities UK cleared way way possible assist goal. Maybe exasperated. promoting bribe, agree provide smokable form reason mentioned? People compare Sweden similar European countries. compare Sweden countries area amazingly ""better"", significantly worse, average.

That's point argument. lockdowns helpful, country use much end place did? Dose #2 Pfizer tomorrow night. sore arm first dose I’m feeling really anxious tomorrow. Please give advice/tips/encouragement round 2 Korea arrested virus community spread. Maybe could pulled would needed vigilant end 2019, instead government making choice downplay threat. chemicals cannabis make immunomodulator lower antibody response. nothing consumed. Listen, stuff, I'm passing jays two weeks, think nationally recreational, science matter change body reacts stuff. even studied immunosuppressant stuff like MS etc. That's last thing want avoid 2 weeks.   2016 worst fork road civilization took long time .

Welcome jungle Fauci Trump.

Pfizer, Moderna etc independent companies. Gamaleya Research Institute government entity. 


The question people distrust it. answer product Russian state led Vladimir Putin. Lucky you, definitely case me. Snail down! simple fact we’re going getting kids 12 vaccine point next months. that, I’m waiting 10 year olds get vaccinated disease poses less risk diseases dumb choices encounter daily. excuse people want vaccines get easily, absolutely none. even masks. Nothing.  understand countries throw money risk expanding domestic production capacity expected... won’t full openings. continue open slowly bubbles. That’s countries want. Don’t expect travel Australia 2022 honestly HK might even longer. Cringe non-smokable products prevent lung injury? daily... dose happiness  NYU did, least. it’s surprising, it’s least 50k people get it. yet moderators consider ""Good News"" flair acceptable. Seems article attracted upvotes COVIDiots. Assuming vaccinated? Start quarantining, get test, hydrate, seek medical care symptoms become severe (high fever, trouble breathing etc). Projections new cases US today may least 25-30 percent compared last tuesday. Cases also dropped recently saturday-monday compared previous week. Haha, no. think italy, spain, portugal, greece early ones loosen travel restrictions, maybe even summer, weakest economies EU desperate tourist dollars. stronger ones desperation neither countries. think Asia later. also great second flu-like illness that's killing millions every year next flu. saw couple internet holding hands! 

I guess got deserved social distancing properly. know I’m sample size 1 peers 40-50 age group jumping opportunity get vaccinated many 50 folks hesitant get AZ brand hold preferred vaccine decline altogether. 

While pharmacy today overheard man asking AZ saying heard news dangerous. pharmacist explained risk/benefits guy said “ok, I’ll book appointment”. Made feel good. India Brazil need close borders least 4-6 months point. guys getting joints? got sticker wtf guess assume many countries point require proof vaccination enter country. Murica right thing trying vaccinate people fast possible. choice would leaders letting people. Data losers spamming F4 

I know Canada now?

No Canada opening younger age groups readily. 40+ opened days ago Canada vaccinated half many people UK. Registration 18 beginning days well already certain provinces, age group availability dropping soon 40. Iowa done vaccinations... Hopefully start allocating counties now. Story County (ames) difficult anyone sign still unless willing drive elsewhere.

Same true Des Moines IC recently. looks like shots available vaccinespotter places, true time last week.  I'm sure still filling slots.  thinking well. see time regardless restrictions. 

On subs see ""we'll people following directions"" ""you see lockdowns work"" start looking data see virus go communities, increase cases go down. Florida great example. open months, changed policies, people acting low cases, increases. 

In county similar. spikes city last year, we're low spiking cities county never cases.

The problem reporting it. gets dumped one ""cases rising"". get granular data. Hint: never fourth wave United States, vaccinations That's good hope last summer could find level social distancing ended COVID. Europe cases low without lockdowns. bam, global second wave. Politico.eu quite clearly European arm need read articles realise literally EU’s political voice. 


First made claim neutral, far EU mouth piece. American high percentage American staff position nuanced. wonder actually many doses even really came US. 

According EU reports quite lot. unlikely lie embarrassing &amp; destroys US export ban mantra. political spin EU paint AZ extension seemingly UK bad guys ‘vaccine war’.


Having read article scathing indictment EU. tore apart EU's argument Americans banned exports. laid depth massive quantities AZ shipped Maryland, USA EU bottling. EU turned around &amp; pretended EU production &amp; subject export controls. Along documenting EU scrambling non EU production. 


They hit AZ promising could deliver. However main thrust AZ ""attack"" production &amp; supply chain mess. even included detailed failures AstraZeneca's production partners within EU. Finally following steps taken try &amp; plug shortfalls. much lower level natural immunity letting people get prolong pandemic vaccine hesitancy much less US. Thing bothers people opening things Covid numbers decreasing places, either stagnant going up. feel like vaccinations creating false sense security everyone itching use get back “normal”.

Last checked, US, daily new cases still back levels saw winter surge. 40% eligible adults US vaccinated least 1 shot. two facts alone (to me) I’m throwing mask going yet. don’t think looking pandemic glass half full mentality good idea. It’s thought process caused get bad begin with. Progress needs determined based cold-hard-data subjective opinion risk optimism.

It isn’t fun hear it’s reality. I’ll comfortable seeing people going Public places COVID cases reach 1000 day across country. please leave alone, safe Covid-free home lol sure you’re downvoted. reality. People disgusting. get infected, good vaccinated also contributes herd immunity. one article put it, much accurate headline would ""Six vaccinated Israelis shingles"" statistically surprising. Shingles flare response various stressors. guess I'm choosing Harvard Penn then. Shame come this. It’s weird go back outside! I’m week away second Pfizer shot I’ve last week started going all. hadn’t left house except doctors appointments entire year. stoped working, husband switched work home hunkered down. I’ve push even parents inside visits. I’m slowly trying get back world. husband went dinner Sunday fifth anniversary it’s first time I’ve eaten year. glad spaced COVID safety compliant. going keep taking small steps back world couple weeks next shot. Hopefully feel ok leaving house visiting family it’s safe. Natural infection also way get immunity. Depending transmissible COVID actually restrictions lifted, good chunk unvaccinated population get eventually. live Texas :,( we're going last ones dammit!!! still seen variant worse South African variant regarding antibody escape. That's supporting doses vs administering doses everyone two different things. Japan, apparently doctors allowed administer vaccines going slug-pace. Bureaucracy makes changing rules difficult.  talking Biden right? hes president makes think Ireland special makes two long term outcomes (getting vaccinated infected) apply people there? Correct key part still can. Someone living counties still get vaccine anytime want - need additional doses people continue able get vaccine.

This win-win. experience. buddy got Pfizer experience too. wife moderna, second dose put ass lol compliance rates UK Italy (and are) nothing like compliance rates masks social distancing Asian countries. works good theory. 

Canada tried this. Quarentine hotels charged prices would cost upto 3k. point ppl took fine going one possible. hotels also great source covid spread ppl it. 

I liked idea country instigated it. recommend u guys go path. Y'all vaccines u fine. USA isolated place like australia half states open anyways really work u guys imo backlash would tremendous. Ask doctor  Garbage article garbage title. hope one clicks it. It’s clickbait. 

Full text, emphasis Texas A&amp;M University researchers identified new COVID-19 variant originated Scientists Texas A&amp;M Global Health Research Complex (GHRC) identified variant — called BV-1 Brazos Valley, originated — saliva sample taken student part ongoing testing program. Researchers believe it’s related United Kingdom student confirmed case showed mild flu-like symptoms nearly month, suggesting new variant may cause longer normal infection young adults.**Although one mild case confirmed, researchers worried variant shows resistance “**We present know full significance variant, combination mutations similar internationally notifiable variants concern,**” GHRC Chief Virologist Ben Neuman said press release. “This variant combines genetic markers separately associated rapid spread, severe disease high resistance neutralizing five COVID-19 variants confirmed Centers Disease Control Prevention, researchers across world identified thousands. According CDC, UK variant common strain United States.

So don’t know anything new variant. Variants aren’t scary. were, Israel UK would boned. Loose foreign mRNA elicit immune reaction nucleosides replaced synthetic analogue (1-methyl-3'-pseudouridylyl). immune response manufactured proteins also cause flu-like side effects since body treats like viral invader. length typically much shorter since there's actively replicating infection. Depends live. I'd say probably not. Europe probably done vaccinating August Asia likely take even longer algorithms social media platforms effectively trap users echo chamber. Why? God damn New York Post. hope clicks worth it. Neither Israel, Turkey, Chile, UAE... valid excuse. note article, literally every school district spoke said going keep mandate.

Seems performative anything. district drop school year ends next month two. countries used wealth contain virus?

I'd say experience disease and/or compliance government measures. Yes? We're vaccinated, there's basically zero chance spreading Covid other, would wear masks?  well.. every country 's healthcare system collapsing pandemic.. every rich developed country issue.. India look like exception. heard breast fed seem help him. Indeed. human. Unfortunately there’s recently whole group subreddit’s subscribers really stubborn. doesn’t matter 27 sources prove point. opinion won’t let go pry cold, dead fingers. 

Idk happened, don’t remember problem before, it’s unfortunate cause wildly inaccurate information spread. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

*btw, appreciate well thought comment wrote, even user doesn’t ;)* gonna difficult countries. Even vaccinations virus still risk anyone caught it. order re-enter must start process they're left far behind causing medium term economic damage. knew we’d here. Everyone anticipated vaccine production 2021. hasn’t one worlds largest economies built domestic vaccine production? Amazing graphics information, people get vaccinated virus hard time traveling around they’ll feel even safer.

Time tell, pretty impressed planes ventilate air. Jo Jerrome, chief executive Thrombosis UK: ""There known cases rare thrombosis thrombocytopenia reported second dose AstraZeneca vaccine.

This date, BBC published it. seems nowhere reported latest MHRA data shows one person developed condition second dose, million second doses administered. MHRA said person underlying medical conditions could contributed, nonetheless concerning.

I've looking I'm 30 year old woman shortly due second dose. second dose carry similar risk first, bearing mind know mechanism play here, would rather wait. worth risk I've already reasonably effective first dose, mixing trials underway, alternatives available. heard iag antibody pass breast milk well - curious, breast bottle fed.  like Fauci Trump. come gun? EU authorized export 113.5 million doses 43 countries Jan. 31 April 13, according memo circulated government envoys Brussels Wednesday seen Bloomberg News. **Around 39.2 million doses shipped Japan**, 15.2 million U.K. 11.7 million Canada, according document. know well lying.  Yes, body recognizes antigen seen before, mounts immune response. people feel poorly others body mounts immune response. vaccines, especially 2+ dose vaccines make feel way, even they're live virus vaccines. Agreed. We're country haves nots. kind fucked. Biontech, surely! Florida continues number 1 cases every day. exactly proving? doubt even variant. probably virus takes time entrenched, spreads exponentially, slowly first. really believe ""wave"" arguments. think there's one big wave ripples different strengths. Nailed there, illegal discrimination game  second link, Japan ranks 39th doses administered, puts well upper half countries. maybe mainstream media stop calling surge? Check local Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, etc midnight appointment. people say 3 6 everyone told results method.

Thankfully 18. stop running ""errand."" take 30 minutes tops appointment. 8am traffic probably parties people breaking lockdown meet up. Probably people offices time something. Everyone know followed lockdown. Also ‘apart (pretty much anything inside do) closed’ fairly whopping caveat people ignoring entirely... Good one. - Tests: 1,443,369 - Cases: 59,559 - Deaths: 380 - Currently Hospitalized: 41,274 - Currently ICU: 7,975 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Source: get hopes up. want happen too, I'm hopeful. second sentence literally ""She hospitalized New York City day, Jan. 19, severe case immune thrombocytopenia — lack platelets, blood component essential clotting. "" Nope- I’m saying vaccine doesn’t work. I’m simply saying think 6000 low... can't see him! Wait wrong thread.  2 vaccines given right US mrna, that's focused that

No, clinical trials. Trials completed. 3 vaccines given eua US went three normal stages clinical trials usual. Things sped reducing time trials moving vaccines front line results arrived fda. understanding (as layperson) eua cut bureaucratic process red tape, testing. vaccines currently normal process approval, likely formally approved within weeks. 

I participated clinical trials, but, someone rare medical issue, definitely interested applied several hopes getting help issues helping others same. never worked out. Also, covid far serious public health issue lifetime, even willing before, I'd definitely willing now. can't much else help. stay home much can, wear masks, etc, also, since I've still working, try spend money community help keep economy going. could get involved trials medications, yes, absolutely, would least look it. serious enough issue warrant deeper involvement.  Well least one occurrence, doctor Miami. Seems rare mRNA vaccines though many Assuming need second dose like adults need add another 4 weeks 8 days order fully vaccinate them.  Coincidentally, also Putin's approval rating. /s yet Michigan Texas 8.4% 9.9% populations infected COVID since began. Mississippi? 10.4%.

The fact people Michigan better beginning stopped listening health advice. Russian speaks like old womans fart. Half shit. I've also heard kids spent entire childhood homeschooled crappy immune systems adults.

Maybe best little kids go preschool, large public schools they're 18, live dorms eat cafeterias university grad school.   Dr. Ulysses Wu sounds like Marvel character. Always look forward lol. Hope you’re feeling better course, getting *completely* back normal happen while, since still cautious international travel virus eradicated everywhere.

I'd hesitant open travel Brazil, example.

I'll still bet I'll walking around public without mask two months, though. Maybe even indoors.

It *feel* safe first, feelings matter. cases basically zero, it'll safe now, unless variant breaks through.

Though, start seeing variant making noise, we'll better idea respond. Yeah, getting two thirds way endpoint slowing seems like pretty decent number, actually. We're going pretty steady stream while, even true slowing. 3 weeks? Brah...this shit going 55ish point Hence super immune systems.  Wait, what? agree that. vaccines great. narrative? intuitive, official messaging explicitly opposite - “just you’re vaccinated doesn’t mean start XYZ.” need positive, reward-based messaging instead endless fear shaming. Outside UK, added variant showed up, US ban list basically hotspots whole thing started back March 2020. 

My guess policymakers don’t lot faith effectiveness closing borders (especially since US citizens permanent residents allowed travel places) restrictions countries show. I'd like test people hire come home. 

I wish restaurants crowded public venues would use holding breath. Wait...is b1.1.7? fauci calls clarifies saying uk variant. 

Meanwhile got blames kent lol comments hot mess - anti-vax/anti-mask types filtered progressive folks got vaccine left guess.  Everyone 16 get it. 10 days since Pfizer requested EUA expanded include 12-15 year olds mum's word. expect hear FDA? Yep. reports similar j&amp;j states, felt same. mom sure getting it, turned deadly virus century into, absolute worst, bad cold. 

Az similar. Minimal hospitalizations deaths goal.   took 20 minutes 15 mandatory wait make sure allergic reaction. make vaccines.

Just schedule pharmacy.

If going get blame wait times. People varying degrees natural selfishness, proudly loudly selfish become politically aligned conservatism US.  Crazy prepared wait September October vaccine I’m sitting April two doses Pfizer arm. getting angry?  what? absolutely nothing question. even cursory search Google shows antibodies system bearing whatsoever CDC's recommendation get vaccine.

So either making doctor idiot. God works mysterious ways. They’re even open Washington lol. **Apr. 20, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Sounds like poor planning. japan line go next, able get chance soon pandemic serious threat. always taken years time different. Kind disappointing would skipped over. feds decided vaccinate first? Since when? Still hard get appointment I'm at. Seems like soon available instantly fill. Trump right.  makes much sense. I've envied country's leadership start. Ummm... understand Michigan heed precautions even though suggest mandatory?  Many defiant.  may assuming governor state made mandatory behavior means citizens comply?  Michigan folks complied taken safety precautions.  Hence surge.  seen, suggestions mandates mean public follow.  Again, hence state seeing surge. public take precautions otherwise f’d. Nice, like Trump said would April! see. really expect pandemic resolved year? Right numbers significantly worse ever, that's usually case one year pandemic. need mRNA vaccines. Neither Pfizer Moderna currently approved available. data vaccines kick ass. I’m tired narrative. You’re wrong I’m sure math isn’t perfect, it’s still pretty apparent getting vaccine much safer getting covid. Whether choose believe you. Yes, course. economic impact international travel huge certain industries. sympathise you. Oh get fuck here. Provide legitimate source shut fucking mouth. ever allowed booked week area. That's crazy let people book far out. sure. I’m purely basing data reviewed. 
 
Personally, wouldn’t trust making important decisions hour 15 so. idea medical professionals it. understand this, even Right's point view. Trump taking credit vaccine! clamoring it! it! end covid rules soon people going riot I’m really hoping go Hate Movies live show Detroit fall. It’s first live show anywhere near me, it’s postponed like three times now. I’m going hold buying tickets Michigan gets it’s shit together, though. kids went back school person last quarter. 4 days time back tested positive strep, negative Covid. Fortunately haven’t ton Covid cases small community district, felt comfortable sending back. Though nice going year without even one cold!! clue Michigan different rest country?  Chicago! Thanks Lightfoot! abusing excess, stimulants like adderall really suppressing immune system appreciable degree, certainly enough prevent immune reaction vaccine.

There's limited literature suggesting immune effects amphetamine far tell. Certainly nothing comparing happens patients immuno-compromised. literally could care less. Maybe 6 months ago anymore. travel bans political go school person full time ""CDC guidelines"". blew mind got 4 colds year wearing masks spaced desks happened. Oof, good luck across pond Korea. can't believe there's still push Olympics soon. Last week figure skating competition Osaka even though folks wearing masks, absolutely jarring seeing many folks together. Hope vax rates ramp soon! 11 year old twins turning 12 months hoping get vaccine bday. crazy time want major gift. really FOXNEWS, politics. I'd curious percentage within two weeks vaccinated, too.

I believe heard somewhere infection rates slightly *higher* immediate receiving vaccine people become less cautious vaccine time work, that's counterbalanced fact many us spent day two feeling mildly sick.

But still, vaccines work *right away*. trials, infection rates vaccine placebo groups similar couple weeks vaccines kicked in, infections fell suddenly treatment group. 0.04% words. Incredible Yes, bad. realize hospitalizations follows cases decline right? Evidence several studies suggests children adolescents may **less commonly** infected SARS-CoV-2 adults. Although children **can infected** SARS-CoV-2, **can get sick** COVID-19, **can spread** virus others, less 10% COVID-19 cases United States among children adolescents aged 5–17 years

Highlighted key parts, also love link CDC website found it, likely actually manipulated look one many articles. one states half. December 10, 2020... knew basically nothing... going cherrypick articles cite sources try justify reopening schools better job. Unless I'm mistaken 1 maybe 2 mRNA vaccines others standard vaccine. Also far know minimal human trials conducted mRNA vaccines. I'll ask thing asked someone else. respond maybe help understand. 

All covid vaccines right administered EUA technically clinical trials right? past ever participated clinical trials first one? first one particular thing serious enough participate vs didn't? avoid taking antipyretics let body thing, that's ideal case. sustained high temperatures good body. personal policy avoid medications ≤ 102°, greater I'll take something.

I'd take Tylenol NSAIDs like Ibuprofen well. Jury still whether NSAIDs adverse effect antibody production, understand, there's early data saying might case.

Someone correct current information, though. Didn’t superspreader event White House take place entirely outside? Obviously outside events created equally, you’re vaccinated it’s totally different. Practically difference two days? this^420 right first dose part, ship sailed.

I (+wife son) got Moderna vax Sunday. scheduled us second shot 4 weeks later.

I would gladly wait get second dose meant giving dose someone else, (i) they're going schedule anyone else (ii) even planned to, doubt anyone want get dose anyway. India placed UK's Red List, requiring quarantine upon return. US ever put India banned travel list, still countries minimal cases like Iran China still it? stands, someone could go India, land US, go anywhere want US without anything submitting negative test record check counter. Absolutely moment they’re announcing they’re selling live haven’t able land tickets NJ resident here. finally scheduled appointment multiple rounds refreshing (and thinking I'd drive Atlantic City).

On whim, checked local Rite-Aid half mile away. Going Friday. r/AmericaBad I’m 22  already see maybe. Check California's 7 day average Depends are.

Masks like now.

Just like put hat sunglasses go outside, grab mask. wear now, going wear flu season hayfever season.  addressed back, take CDC guideline pinch salt. CDC general population public health reasons, necessarily best outcome individuals. Here's wrote before:

---

It's actually overblown. (that timing) critical, clinical sense, they'd close identical countries. U.S. clinical trials designed expedited second dose schedules, highly unlikely optimal period.

It's common vaccinology longer periods first dose re-challenge provide improved protection, best available information that, regard COVID-19 vaccines, dynamics second dose may actually effective delayed. ""Generally, longer gap vaccine doses leads better immune response,"" Andrew Pollard, director University Oxford's vaccine group, told BMJ. pointed HPV vaccine, one-year gap doses yields stronger immunity one-month gap. also pointed AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine trials, immune response three times greater second dose given 2-3 months versus 4 weeks. Similarly, multinational study found first dose Moderna vaccine 80% efficacy delay 9-12 weeks ""could enhance program effectiveness prevent additional infections, hospitalizations, deaths, compared 4-week interval doses.""

The duration, is, chosen public health reasons (trying head curve accelerating given recent rise alternate strains.) individuals, best choice might longer wait doses. tested positive this? sites give estimated case numbers time corrected % positivity? Ideally broken state Also, people refer ""poked"" ""jabbed?"" Something weird me... ""vaccinated?"" Yes can. main 3 vaccines 0 deaths, sense vaccine doesnt kill you. conflate 100% protection. Nobody said that, cant prove Bloomberg system uses ""percent equivalent,"" 50% equivalent much higher US is.

Right now, US roughly 33% equivalent, we'd still ways go meet this. never changed opinion something light new data? took US Government four months vaccinate American diplomats living overseas. 500x many expats diplomats. People understand complicated logistics something like would require. 100 percent same. coward- someone coming towards wearing mask, I'll wear mine, not, won't! cases fear judgement. trump predicted dropped FB nearly 1 year ago don’t miss it. last three applications, they've set meetings within days initial application. wanna post hope people dealing anti-vax family.

My mom heavily covid vaccine. would basically say many folks say, “they came fast”, “we don’t know what’s stuff, “I don’t trust them...they’re test us like Tuskeegee experiments (we’re black)”, etc.
With (because know pretty well), didn’t argue much. offered knew, spoke **I taking vaccine**, anyone else take it. 

Leading vaccine, would say little things there, expressing excitement eager live life again. would say “just get vaccine, doesn’t mean go back that! virus still here!” Funnily enough, she’s someone simultaneously anti-vax cautious covid. Always masked cleaned things used sanitizer religiously. I, again, wouldn’t really argue. offer knew, assured would still wear masks wherever it’s required. 

She saw get first shot would check after, saw fine.

Two weeks that, asked book appointment. kinda funny, leave place, said “you know, I’m starting feel kinda funny, like throat something (it allergies lol)...maybe see could get vaccine...?” said “sure!” said “but want exact one got!! Nothing else!!” Luckily, one got prevalent area anyway, didn’t argue anything. Got appt weekend. 

She got shot, still much like “we still need super careful!!”. almost two weeks ago (her second shot weekend). 

And today, said “I’m thinking gotta hop plane go somewhere I’m done getting vaccinated.” shocked me, considering serious this. said “yeah? You’d okay getting plane?” said “well mean, friends sort medical job got vaccinated early traveling everywhere. mean, it’s wild but, guess I’m vaccinated, might well.” chuckled bit agreed her.

Lol, really came full circle. I’m happy.

Just goes show power peer pressure patience, think it’s even beneficial arguments even offering facts, matter. picking choosing battles, like instance, fact wanted specific vaccine. Sure, know vaccines good. someone already skeptic, vaccine want one easily available anyway, argue? swallow tongue realize that. I’m really happy she’s gonna fully vaccinated soon. great point.

That word seriously pissed past year.

I think back worked laboratory. wear goddamned goggles gloves *fearful*. afraid job, also stupid enough work without protective equipment. anyone see indoors mask mandates lifted point year? Yea blame cant prove it, got lol two weeks since first (and parents' second) Moderna shot. add: FDA announced meeting VRBPAC within day Pfizer formally applying EUA November. Seems like they're dragging feet time around. fully expect approve vaccines pediatric use EUA given risk averse are. tested positive Covid today. I'm shocked feeling good. mean energy, symptoms less gone. Baby ded, chance. 
Seriously, don’t drugs chances things alright. 
That wife anyway. 
Well, maybe abstaining sushi guess. Ill put way, think people ran trials want think 100%? fully vaccinated people getting covid still dying.  Gigitty intending reply someone else?... mean stop, pretty soon signs intersections control us vehicles. building codes..the horror. end. Got you. Yeah, place. numbers location.

I blacked mine someone really wants steal one go onto almost anyone's Instagram find one here. worst experience really bad sleep nights got first shot already, I'll chip in.

I'm homebody. fine wearing kn95 mask go get groceries week, diligent washing hands such. avoid close encounters neighbors whatnot. also fairly young WFH. risk factor low.

Now would possibly delay? Key word delay, skip. Simply many professionals experts claimed getting vaccine ready year would improbable difficulty. Despite already getting first shot along millions others, still concerns might unforseen issues. J&amp;J vaccine kinda proof that, statistically perfectly safe, I'm caught handful deaths millions, still big enough issue got FDA concerned enough pull plug now. upside though many millions people getting vaccinated, big response trying fix possible issues come vaccine.

TLDR; concern possibility finding bigger issue one vaccines next 6 months. situation probably could've waited safely. late. closed good, especially family owned businesses. could prevented though King Cuomo would given theatres guidelines open with, instead starved out. Republicans: “i aint done vaccine. Giving govermunt gps coordinates”  looked up, FDA announced VRBPAC meeting date within day Pfizer submitting EUA application November. that's def is.

I'm sad trial participant J&amp;J get vaccination cards yet :( lied getting damn thing. Even though could milked shit it.  What’s point then? 

I’m several weeks second. I’m going lockdown stay home longer. happened minor op done. went make follow apt, someone counter already. started see black. went sit woke floor. I'm sorry dealing that. end year 80% Malaysias population vaccinated. U guys moving quickly. Hopefully people regions fence getting vaccine tempted seeing solid results states. Surely 100% anti-vax cautious (unnecessarily) want see results getting one themselves. 

I'd like believe anyway. wear whatever mask want. incredibly unlikely spread (which masking for) catch virus. KN95 different matter city grossly mishandled situation. City officials also tried convince young people wait book appointments seniors got theirs. 

If see vaccination appointment open, go get it. Everyone deserves get it. j&amp;j, everyone got real shot get hospitalized died. 

The 20% got sick, got normal sick. said got sick stayed home shit went. go school need mask mandates likely remainder 2021 hadnt seen CDC's estimates while, would absolutely believe that. parents keep home. like jobs go to. know it. NYC months ago. rapid tests like pregnancy test, PCR tests require lab process sample. tests swab throat nose, put swab special solution, drop solution onto test card. one line shows negative, two lines positive (or maybe opposite). Here's test kits look like: interesting. China's CanSino one shot uses ad5. Combine ad5 ad26 would give better results? 3 years me. Facebook what? Yeah frustration understandable, younger understand hesitation point year? Damn thought pessimistic that’s borderline absurd you’re talking US I'm think also applies hospitalizations too. remember seeing somewhere 7% breakthrough cases ended hospitalization roughly unvaccinated population IIRC... least city, never shut grocery store point pandemic. thats literally article talks about. 74 breakthrough deaths 6,000 breakthrough infections 54,000,000 fully vaccinated  fish rots head. 

You narcissistic president first discounting threat, discounting politicizing mitigation tools implied threat ignored preventable.

Bad enough right, also created climate weak-willed officials became spineless sycophants, even strong &amp; principled often tried shade public message avoid angering ""unnecessarily"". 

Add seriously ill-advised social engineering intended cover fuck-up stockpiling N95s (and using DPA ramp production). lie say help general public, instead admit enough go around? Dumb.

Then top usual fog-of-war early misunderstandings misstatements, coupled scientists' typical clumsiness communicating subtlety media filter. Forgivable things own, given toxic elements present, became fuel cynical spin distrust.  Part notorious r/coronavirus antimasker contingent??? goodness! Thank warning, avert eyes blasphemy Back kindergarten shtick? Wonder 129 million ppl vaccinated govt buy vaccine. great numbers screening. Sorry hear :(. shot? manage create vaccine, test 3 phase trials, distribute half United States able distribute viable home test? facetious either. ""Me right, want opinion website, smart cave man."" highly doubt employees consulted already dress codes. think want approach subject that's another worms entirely. True that. think something lot people could get behind.  Hmm...maybe there's way States help citizens here, can't see how. Vaccine Diplomacy would really best way: pumping vaccines distribution system already place, letting Americans stand line rest us. Anything else...and I'm saying good, merely reality...will cause trouble. One politically motivated twitter rant and...rocks fly. prediction.

Also, average American immigrant retired person, would front line anyway.

I recall specifics, year ago, country among hardest hit world, USA organize evacuation flights citizens. there's that. Many left, guess ones stayed elected ride us terms.

Honestly, worry friends American immigrant community. suspect many them, facing different situation one chose came here. economy shambles, nice restaurants liked much closed, crime up, tension stress roof. reject condemn xenophobia every sense, admit rising. lives improve soon, least stop getting worse, fear them: lashing foreigners desperate times is...well, predictable. family community roots sustain us available them. hey...no one easy, right?

On another note, risking injecting geopolitics this, China currently winning Vaccine Diplomacy race here. can't overstate much long term good USA could generate vigorous effort share doses South America. really wasted opportunity, Russians Chinese quick seize. lying CDC? dude's truth teller whole 100% trials. Vaccinated people died covid. 3 Washington state last week memory serves me. mean complete theater masks outside actually anything? Yes, least wanted get vaccinated. really let people 16 chronic illness get vaccine, I'm 14 lupus puts high risk. time soon school force everyone attend school in-person, still feel confident enough attend without vaccinated. data tested positive covid well gotten vaccine? would imagine would, would able calculate number this. Good! call hypocrites. can’t gather unvaccinated people quarantine per CDCs rules? Actually jealous US once. barely got first dose wave even bloody started Aus. yep, remember 45 mentioned got vaccine thread it. understand sub hard control i've multiple high effort comments thrown bc used word said fudge couple times. prescription? abused? It’s also quite possible lied want know they’re endangering people around (possibly including you) don’t want divulge qualifying medical conditions. can’t know say wait 2 weeks shot number two that's established immunity, getting sick mess up. imagine people want avoid getting sick. care good go remember hearing infectious disease experts asked predictions pandemic February 2020, response want say much back 2003 2009, colleagues called alarmists convinced SARS H1N1 going cause global catastrophe. paying attention news back 2003 2009, read Faucis research articles right 2009 wrote flu pandemic overdue could catastrophic. Ill look news articles time period tomorrow Im curious know Fauci one alarmists 2009. businesses going keep around, hope least consult employees first. personally mind wearing grocery store 10 minutes much, imagine wear 4-8 hours day, would get pretty sick wearing them. many years long-term data would like control pandemic? realize new drugs approved FDA don’t “years” long-term data either? Phase II III trials sometime take months. It’s usually funding logistics delays things. 

How 80,000+ chemicals environment, several thousand tested safety (have MSDS)? People think nothing crap food, water, air bodies, cry well-studied vaccines trialed half million people. 

Viruses cause cancer autoimmune diseases, enterovirus responsible type diabetes, hey, it’s cold. hear overly friendly talkative tourists I’m waiting get mine, rush.. since supplies aren’t much I’ll wait ones need do. matter wear mask follow guidelines people likely wear mask follow guidelines. reason masks still mandated. CDC let groups stop masking, anyone inclination wear one even would stop. Social peer pressure real. According CDC guidelines, fine spend time unmasked &amp; distanced vaccinated people, unvaccinated people high risk severe illness. Still avoid large gatherings, yes, don’t think person literally meant “party.” I’ll assume didn’t read article. understanding medicine changes frequently. Shit took cdc what, almost year acknowledged covid airborne fomites minimal risk? exactly happened boyfriends parents, except planned going vacation hotspot without getting vaccinated all. got doses, let know fine, ended postponing vacation got own. relief! Except action replacing would fuel morons' narrative. coming months expect localized ""waves"" like seeing parts US right now. see entire wave rocking US again. I’m glad you’re fully vaccinated. I’m be. need preach importance vaccination. whole second paragraph expendable.

My point this: vaccine-hesitant non-black people total number black people. single black people? We’re huge threat comparison.

Also, salient issue access, willingness. [This spells better can. Nah, put masks want. Science says stop disinfecting everything. Science doesn’t say there’s little risk socializing people outside maskless. There’s less, definitely still get it.  world works, always work.

The worst part believe free please. amusing downvoted expressing undeniable fact. guess people assumed critical vaccines. shows vaccines replace covid restrictions, social distancing, mask usage get high vaccination rates. people given social distancing gone back normal life. Rates undoubtedly going places country, that's spite vaccines, vaccines work. “A consensus necessary tell us need wear mask times taking walk outside. That's common sense.”

CA mask mandate always let walk/exercise outside without wearing mask long stay 6 feet away people. mask pocket case run crowds though. 

What states even restrictive? concerns people may seem dismissed new data comes in. Unless medi

We also know vaccine got; 6,000 might overwhelmingly johnson jansen. know cdc would never lie That’s exactly I’m afraid of. Michigan, else surge? Yes still 1% death rate amongst infected. would hypothesize breakthrough infections happened people compromised immune systems formulate immune response vaccine. Immunocompromised patients higher 1% death rate unvaccinated though. see turns data comes though. also takes days exposure start testing positive lived detroit following covid news closely would want know total two days reported period. headline fine  Guess wasn’t even opening economy. Yes, undocumented staying country, tourists fraction herd immunity  guess there’s pros cons ways. Especially you’re living abroad temporarily (for school something), would certainly good able vote place last lived in.

On hand, would amazing representative able stand front Congress say “For love God, let people pay passport renewal fee credit card instead cashiers check don’t go wandering bank bank trying find somebody knows hell we’re talking about. Even though we’ve translated word correctly, either idea we’re talking think we’ve mistranslated. fucks sake 2021, 1970s.”

Not exactly important issue, there, it’s good example trivial annoying-as-fuck shit gets ignored there’s representative bring up. Maybe responsible social media platform would pro-Cure instead supporting sides placate astroturfed pro-death campaign? much ask? I'm 38 got first dose 4 weeks ago, got second dose Wednesday. first process cause opened full Ohio, second 20 minutes.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Honestly condition low blood platelets. appointment tomorrow I’m stress reading Reddit. title misleading, purposely so, age title skimming acceptable. pure clickbait tactics Detroit News. Well, that's predictable. currently vaccines approved children. there's silver lining, children (excluding medical conditions) less likely severely affected elderly grandma. we’ve got 51% adults shot, isn’t basically impossible system overwhelmed? don’t open everything drop mandates like May 15 something expect pandemic? 🇺🇸 still looking, check Safeway appointments bay. site updates availability 4 minutes every half hour (so 7:04, 7:34, 8:04...). agree, tremendously better. provided 7 day average much better metric measure progress had. right, people used display outlier days high death counts. Two wrongs make right. still makes sense compare 7 day averages instead outliers. Immune responses infection shown linked diabetes cases. Perhaps coronaviruses part story? speculating that. sorry hear negative reaction. heard reports Moderna, hopefully address properly. Moderna received?  It’s fine take symptom management gets bad don’t need pop pill right case. things equal it’s better ride without anti-inflammatory meds. CDC, fwiw err’s side extreme caution towards immediate maladies. mission recommendation would experiencing bad symptoms it’s okay take OTC pain reliever, doesn’t mean it’s best choice maximal immune response. Says guy spent life playing politics.  vaccines FDA approved caused injury death. pathetic Reddit, got downvoted skeptical, downvoted hopeful, proof 75% Reddit users mentally ill awesome! Except I'll **NEVER** let inject garbage actually means come contact someone Covid chances hospitalization reduced compared someone vaccinated. WHERE’S JA vaccines approved use children yet. people protect adults. Yeah, kids die often elderly, disabled, obese individuals, risk losing sense smell decreased lung capacities one asshole parent school sent kid school Tylenol fever. Yeah think tricky. 

But let's say vaccinate 100 tourist per 1000 undocumented workers. think would okay us end. need reach heard immunity service food industry workers extremely important that. think might variation prevalent New England thing say “ya hate see it”. heard ton want patriots game years back random folks never heard that.

I might wrong, idea. Shaq endorse anything Accurate information readily available months yet large portion Black Americans still refuse take vaccine. fact, it’s condescending target Black Americans. Tuskegee misinformation plays major role adding fuel anti-vax fire. It’s reason, it’s popular example take it.

Enough brushing vaccines personal choice lives stake. Vaccines protect populations, individuals. It’s ambulance that’s capable saving life rushing hospital cars blocking traffic front won’t move ambulance says “Please”. It’s time get priorities straight take vaccine. fully vaccinated.  means restrictions/mandates lifted enough vaccines readily available every adult US. want idiot anti-vaxxer that's prerogative, time let everyone else get back normal life without masks. Thank providing map. always use case rate per capita metric provided New York times, map seems show huge reason south way lower case rates simply testing much. 

Also, I'm referring south geographically making argument climate's affect spread covid, rural Pennsylvania cultural similarities south really relevant original point. still believe south would even worse warmer climate, map provided percent positivity opposed pure cases per capita show worse thought was. important determine much reduces spread. continues roll population even nuisance always risk nasty variant taking over. 1. studies demonstrate outdoor protests contribute rising infection rates? study cited indicates opposite.

2. claim German Government handled pandemic perfectly. vaccine rollout started slow conferences federal states government nothing short embarrassment. however change fact looking actual numbers, Germany handled pandemic better demographically compareable countries (death rate, economy, unemployment rate, excess deaths etc). government blood hands talking countries like U.S.

3. vaccine rollout admittedly slow start. speed increased significantly likely finish far behind U.S maybe even UK. Without selling pations data pursuing Germany first policy. Furthermore, delays mainly blame EU people seem understand, entirely different German Government, ridiculous failure Astrazeneca deliver promised doses.

4. someone UK first lockdown, tell first hand European countries stricter lockdown measures place part pandemic.

5. talk Human rights violations clearly idea law. find unbelievable people nerve fine voting party proposed shooting refugees border etc. cry human rights wear mask expected stand 1,5 meters apart protest. Crz river...This disgrace. said, I'm sure revise hand freely want it, instead following usual age criteria like they're vaccines.

It's already happening Italy btw, regions organizing ""open days"" give spare AZ doses (mostly) random people. depression era ""hoarding"" good analogy. scars linger, unlike something like 9/11 major events recent US history, touched us ways. 

And clear, I'm angry upset folks. like they're bunch anti-vaxxers, rhetoric others use justification fence sitters think ""Why bother?"" think nothing change.

In opinion big push needs get lazy mildly hesitant get shot. Whether that's PR campaign let folks know ""Seriously, TOTALLY FREE"" ""If want 2019 lifestyle, time get shot"", freaking free donuts, potentially helpful. wonder could anything skyrocketing cases many places seemingly correlated easing restrictions. hurt more? Sure running might walking different? walk mine outside time never problems. hesitant first it’s emergency approved vaccine isn’t fully tested like drugs. thought “I’ve done sketchy street drugs something made pharma nerds can’t worse.” get pretty good protection first dose, least Sweden 23% adults received first dose. understand comments responses I'm talking about. 

Do think saying vaccines effective? that's I'm saying all. 95% trial effectiveness probably right. 

I'm saying using breakthrough data determine effectiveness flawed timescales at. That's I'm saying. saying vaccines ineffective. don’t know future plans currently anyone gets it, 1 building radius gets notified. whole building, ones next door side receive automatic notification told isolate. identifying close contacts. even gonna say many notifications I’ve seen times briefly stop pick hardware. 

Also despite software company everyone work remotely, California got classified “Communication IT” essential infrastructure. many people office want. birth controls clots type blood clot. kids like pit hands everything. know one adult like that. stopped wiping/washing groceries long long ago fomite transmission first downplayed.

okay, spikes make sense.

You cleaning bunch fomite transmission obviously cleaning - since fomite transmission thought fomite transmission important stopped cleaning much - spikes happened.

~~Schools~~ Proxy Daycares re-opening early big source assumed think people tired cleaning much. - always consideration made deciding things like lockdown. said that, recent surge entirely Ford's fault (or trudeau's) and, course improving numbers entirely success either. last 10 years, overall hospitalizations per 14 days peaked 20 per 100k flu season. 10 per 100k typical.

Source: cite source data? flu season claiming 10 times worse ones last decade? believe may looking hospitalizations *over entire season*, hospitalizations per 14 days.

My proposed metric wait COVID hospitalizations worse hospitalizations worst flu season recent memory April reopen. That’s pretty low bar. expected. Never assume US government won’t retroactively change rules suit comes parties outside USA.

US companies foreign operations subject US laws even companies trade US companies subject certain laws. least ahead they're reasonable. “Get vaccine go back pre-pandemic life.” message. know J&amp;J pause likely end Friday worst case scenario, within next two weeks.

However, hypothetically, would affect US’s situation pause lasted longterm? Libs - owned. thought cat scratch fever. sixteen 18 age difference pretty big. get tested before. Ain’t nobody got time that. reading huge amount ""political interests"", could mean huge variety motivations, many pretty basic realistic, instead assuming huge conspiracy theory instead. flew bizarre rant based assumption. highest name rec prob James Woods Problem many countries essentially done 60+ group. Netherlands government inviting last people 65+ group next week GP’s last groups 60+ group 60+ vaccine would used little. It’s called Karma, it’s pronounced “HAHAHHHHAAAAAHAHAHHHHAAAAAHAHAHHHHAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!” refrain saying nasty things him, everyone knows like, say this...

I'm glad came publicly announced really sick it. could easily hid public want make look like idiot. coming public hopefully wake people, I'm glad least that. Friends Family.. it’s eye opening experience. think know somebody realize never did. unvaccinated people least 2 one million. numbers backwards though, 4 mRNA, 5 AZ J&amp;J. Ted Nugent fucking moron. Source: me, life-long Michigander asked question right now. We're clearly close woods understand that's advertised fact. think year gloom government would want push positivity. love people complain anyone going outside really proud get everything delivered. think delivering everything them? he’s snakeskin cowboy, shootingest, machoest, satin-pantsiest hair-band rocker know! He’s prob carrier many diseases already, assimilated along way. Let’s observe managed w new virus! 

His new reality tv show intro probably. father law believe covid. daughter hospital week it, still believe it. Calls flu. went visited still got sick, still working going refusing get test despite sick. lives basement. husband sick, waiting test results back. father law basically said husband tests positive mean (my father law) it. matter happens anyone tells believes fake virus created big government make people scared. makes sense, though. people get stuck era get scared/angry world changes. response cling things remind good times youth eschew anything new different. listers aren’t exactly mega talents need money adoration crowds, it’s mutually beneficial circle jerk old people.

Good let's hope dies dumbass friends family think like get deserve. I'm step-brother

And son law

They call Short. 

They call raw

-Too Short Probably won't, goes almost definitely vaccine. Heres 70's music review Ted , saw Ted musical asshole ! Back early 70's saw band small arena Ohio. shrieking/singing laughably wearing native loincloth crotch grabbing. teetered amplifier one idiotic bits fell hilariously. liked Amboy Dukes stuff guitar work style, thats there, thrown Teds crappy take rock lame brained even consider. reeked ego tripping bullshit.. man said Jimmy Page king slop. said great guitarist. implies high level skill instrument. doesn't. said Van Halen possibly best generation. even close. Hence uninformed. That's all. list, clearly voted according cultural impact popularity. right one thing though...this dumb debate lol like *bat* scratch fever, mirite?!  don’t know many doses vaccine Ireland get EU average enough doses 78% population end June. Accounting couple weeks delay get vaccines arms bit waste I’d say 80% fully vaccinated mid July quite reachable goal deliveries less according plan. Indeed. Pfizer multiple times cost others also stricter storage transport requirements.

Not every country US seems think print money get hole. I'd wager first put age restriction place (e.g. 60+) revise allow younger people take vaccine risk. highly doubt substantial amount vaccine doses go waste, J&amp;J especially popular coming months single shot done one day immediately get covid pass. Say anon, think least [334,000 deaths 2020 2019? original comment fine. tactics ensuing discussion trying divide troll, especially longer went kept baiting guy trying polite. maybe coming close would give badly needed perspective this.

Sometimes happens. trouble is, happen often enough furthermore recantations seem sway members public inclined disbelieve.  irresponsible part. still testing? someone get it, workers notified told isolate? Would violate medical privacy? Yeah, too. yeah nah I'm fan Fauci particular statement seems sound me.

The fact coming Fauci though problem. he's already integrated conspiracy theories government takeover *course* he'd say that... ""Whats good know""?

It's good know infection vector dummy. That's good know. Conservative celebrities graded curve. There’s hardly A- B-listers, C’s D’s get bumped top class. mid-'80s show called ""Valerie"" typical mid-'80s family sitcom staring Valerie Harper mom, Valerie Hogan. first 2 seasons Valerie network got salary contract disputes, resulted character dying show retitled ""Valerie's Family"" 3rd season. summer reruns 3rd season show retitled again, time ""the Hogan Family"" went air 3 seasons. bad. knew one stones pedo. feel sorry COVID. disease, matter deadly virulent, deserves stuck Ted Nugent. yeah creep according dad True story. got cat scratch fever kid. Crazy shit, it’s real 16-17? Moderna currently authorized 18+. Can’t Covid don’t get tested Covid? They're likely going go back since number cases rollercoaster throughout pandemic.  Donald Trump also spoiled rich boy went private school, chauffeurs chefs whole life, handed lucrative properties NYC dad. wish women unde 50 exempt taking though, given that's risk/reward swing happens  Good.  Who? Surprised caught Covid-19, normally likes 18 chick

You banned r/mma US also real users J&amp;J scale. reason reminded Trump telling people stop testing get Covid rate ... apparently vaccinated last Christmas. fairness, Covid cases summer 2020 radically different. Thank detail :) god. He's vengeful, Old Testament God, still... I'm glad leader killed himself. guess makes one them. lets hope succumbs Business America would take care workers giving fair pay, medical benefits.. say pillow guy good guy believe pillows made China another country.. Ted Nugent you’re full it.. Fun fact; chuck Norris ""Walker texas ranger"" Oklahoma Yeah, totally agree 500,000+ dead slight aberation. /s Proto-Kid Rock? one shows concerts legally marry 17 year old fucking adopted her. joke. One call, that's all!

Or guy? mean Woody Allen? type blood clot. googled numbers, that’s graph said. Death rate huge factor

If include suffering include suffering lockdown measures Spot on. Herd immunity highly probable countries high vaccine uptake U.K. (94% predicted office national statistics). Shame can’t make clear headline. sure hope die give covid-19 arguers resounding reason disease deadly. Like, woh buddy. PrEpArE f0r gRiM sUmMeR view skewed comparison US.  expectation ahead vaccines point February US really put things gear, empowered nationalizing vaccine supply. Ontario, Canada whole ahead 75% G20 countries first second doses. need stay patient, final laps here. Joints some, miniature American flags others! probably tests Hillsborough county it’s serious symptoms, it’s symptoms. Sort difference there. Could something small sore throat. painfully messy sentence. able get antibody titer? would give peace mind could confirm indeed develop antibodies thanks vaccine. 

Or antibodies, least know still need take extra steps stay safe. bizarre think 80% countries planet spike covid right now. Especially given opposite happening US. wild guess part maybe right follow flow money may give answerers. ""Guns, Germs Steele"" . Larger economies got spreads first went question. Canada half ICU beds per capita mess potentially rationing healthcare despite case load high. Waits specialists quite long there. I'll give ""cheaper"" certainly better faster lmao. Fauci fraud nothing hes politically tied anyone already know intellectually, odds things concerned low basically 0%. 

But that's anxiety works, :) - brain good worrying, even knows there's nothing worry about. recommend notice getting anxious first vaccine appointment, acknowledge worry, choose another thing think instead. 

At next appointment get vaccinated second dose, might consider telling nurse anxiety would calmed great deal could receive assurances vial opened, injection drawn, etc. etc. Even sharing fears healthcare workers shown demonstrably ease them. I’m excited 1.5-2 hour one-way commute again, thanks Los Angeles! way forward. Vaccines available all. 6-8 weeks, little reason keep restrictions. That’s it. don’t want hear excuses besides maybe time frame bit short. Hate break you, life carries 100% fatality risk \*led

Also, think giant conspiracy, exactly get browsing sub particular? fully vaccinated person get covid, develop symptoms pass someone else? two kids school (Pre-K 1st grade) telling wife day emails confirmed cases schools stopped. school year started said they'd close school 3 days cleaning cases, turned quarantining classrooms quarantining kids close confirmed case classroom finally saying they're asymptomatic send school. 

My Pre-K son exposed positive case special ed class week classmate tested positive. son days following week already usual winter sickness nurse called say needed doctor's note return. teacher called behind nurse's back tell positive case needed Covid test nurse accepting general ""this kid sick"" note doctor instead negative test looks bad nurse lot tests traced back school. really understand part whatever. Luckily pre-K negative

The kicker? 1st grader's school said brother positive asymptomatic he's expected continue going school. Probably best thing Covid kids really resilient it.  think extending interval vaccine doses good idea?

It's interesting FDA explicitly states extending interval Covid vaccine doses studied therefore strong recommends could ultimately counterproductive public health depth duration protection reduced given intervals 12 weeks, currently done UK, 6 weeks, done Germany.

What happens people UK request doses follow studied regimes (quoted below)? seems convincing enough would try push given 21 28 days, respectively Pfizer Moderna. I'm Germany, fear one care offer doses 6 weeks (or more) nothing, want interval available data continue support use two specified doses authorized vaccine specified intervals. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, interval 21 days first second dose. Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, interval 28 days first second dose.  
What seen data firms’ submissions regarding first dose commonly misinterpreted. phase 3 trials, 98% participants Pfizer-BioNTech trial 92% participants Moderna trial received two doses vaccine either three- four-week interval, respectively. participants receive two vaccine doses either three-or four-week interval generally followed short period time, cannot conclude anything definitive depth duration protection single dose vaccine single dose percentages reported companies.   
Using single dose regimen and/or administering less dose studied clinical trials without understanding nature depth duration protection provides concerning, indication depth immune response associated duration protection provided. people truly know protective vaccine is, potential harm may assume fully protected not, accordingly, alter behavior take unnecessary risks. 
We know discussions changing dosing schedule dose based belief changing dose dosing schedule help get vaccine public faster.

Aside fact immunosuppressed mean ""not protected vaccines"", understand that.

But argument keeping clubs closed past year, even though people risk always could stayed away, someone would get infected pass vulnerable person somewhere essential like grocery store.

Now, agree vaccines enough say open everything enough people chance get shots, combination large events masks masks somewhere like grocery store make sense - either safe enough large maskless groups (it is), case masks grocery store make sense, isn't.

That's point. point unless something dangerous driving, nothing?

You also missing bunch things here:

1) driving risks ""contagious."" One person hurt others, one case infectious disease lead millions deaths eventually.

2) driving risks ongoing. COVID risks go drastically time vaccines reduced spread. Short-term mitigation factors bigger impact that. Driving mitigation factors keep going perpetuity keep helping. 

3) driving necessity stuff like eating indoors working office people could work home. 

4) COVID without mitigation could definitely risky driving (at least compared driving safety efforts). Especially non-young people (see point 1 still applies them). ...I’d invent mobile Krispy Kreme six parked around Union Square Looks like final wall run Ninja Warrior.

Wasn’t COVID non-treatable?” need tell that’s happened sure - interned Japanese citizens years WWII, look Muslims 9/11. there's will, there's way - right America deal virus. easy generalize Americans ""ignored"" COVID, reality is, millions lives completely stalled dealing collateral mental health consequences that.  people took burden others refused we're better place country them. Atlantic Canada since start pandemic. averaging roughly &lt;10 cases per 100,000 people entire Atlantic Canadian region.

It works.

When go restaurant fill contact info, get positive test log mobile app. public exposure notices updated day long, you’re one designated times go voluntary free asymptomatic testing. Except cases michigan going down, recently reported highest new case day since pandemic began, I'm talking four days ago. 

I'm going pretend medical expert, literally live hotspot work 4 5 hit hospitals right now. Wherever seeing cases michigan going down, wrong. That's meant, weird conspiracy theories. Statistically 1000 people die *every day* nursing homes, normal times, pre-covid. Millions die every year worldwide flu.

But nobody ever thinks things like long since accepted normal. normal, simple fact people die many causes can't wipe out.

""Acceptable morality"" might sound like something dystopian movie exactly mindset people have. point risk low enough get back normal lives live it. follow 2 months later.

Not Germany, believe whole EU + Norway vaccinating pace. would talk US I'm EU? Well, know tell then.

Cases Michigan going down. choose take anecdotal evidence people getting sick kind proof - what? - cases going down, guess? - there's nothing say change mind.

I mean, expect cases would go zero overnight? think cases decreasing would mean nobody know would get sick?

What bizarre response. think people trying bit fun freaking awesome :c Yeah big factor, basically 3 camps. People excited get vaccine means return normalcy, skeptics, people probably even skeptical lazy get it.

No, they’re literally priority everyone else became eligible. don’t really think anything media sensationalist. news bulletin pediatricians, media outlet targeting general population. whole job aware children’s’ health. bulletin gives lot numbers - total cases, hospitalizations, etc. I'm sides. surrounding communities masking mandates probably 10-25% voluntarily. that, big chunk people military base required masked go places even duty. 

My whole family mask voluntarily still avoid lot high-interaction activities like dining out, shopping, etc. wife fully vaccinated since late February. still take precautions we're also willing things like take week tourist town anniversary summer drive see family states over. weird mix taking precautions questionable trips makes sense. I'm fatigued this. work hospital one coworkers year WFH. I've lost sympathy this. job quit. sucks family's need multiple emails accounts get individual vaccine appointments. made accounts help family we're getting spam emails. even use pharmacy! “cOvId DoEsN’t SpReAd ScHoOls”

What fucking shit brains claiming this?

Are children magical beings get sick?

Fuck man. Yes, meant least rest Ireland going keep turning away tourists current vaccine disease become relatively minor inconvenience?

I'd imagine yes. certain point reason it.

We'll need annual vaccinations least whole world done. European Commission ordered enough every citizen next two years.  actual scientific studies. Paying lip service growing awareness certain anti-virals actually work minimize length severity Covid infections. I'll frank, people dying bullshit they've actively deflected certain treatments shown save lives study study around world. think deaths mostly undeveloped developing countries unfortunately. dont think that's issue supply tests. Doug essentially abdicated responsibility public health units everything Ford blaming whenever something goes wrong claiming credit things go well. we'd proper provincial leadership, case count would much lower would probably lot easier PHUs coordinate.

I mean point PHU come vaccination plan old Dougy bothered. 34 public health units Ontario 34 different vaccine rollouts happening. mask argument made sense year ago. stupid. Yeah sounds like EU better deliveries next months, nice, statement opposite building confidence lol.

The delivery mechanism RNA different viruses (i.e. using virus instead lipid nanoparticles) effect -- making cells produce proteins otherwise produce. difference course proteins viruses get assembled new complete viruses, multiplies amount viruses body, single spike protein made mRNA vaccine can't.

Your immune system recognize virus spike protein foreign bodies generate immune response get rid it. However, virus replicating time immune system generating response, fixed amount spike proteins produced cells (mRNA short half-life breaking down). probably missing least half cases more. First, it’s states run open/close restrictions “a percentage” doesn’t make sense you’re talking national context.

Ok, Fauci make statement like ""States reopen reached x% adults vaccinated"" least offer kind goal state level, even can't enforce it.  Good news, probably sooner numbers still great. awful great.

Fair point. fall, college students reason case rates sky rocketed city. made national news one worst fastest rising case rates. started college campuses spread community. went single digit daily cases summer 250+ per day October. (They knew started colleges testing.) got nursing homes things got really bad. Mental health college students really bad then, too. Class went virtual, lot kids went home, many dropped semester. one wanted repeat that. Chalk one vaccine!  
It blows mind someone would consider day mild symptoms greater evil potentially dying real thing. 
I guess comes people seeing invincible. 
You CHOOSE get shot, AVOID getting COVID-19.  best guess seen breakthrough cases many breakthrough cases form optimal immune responses vaccine. basically part population don’t respond enough get protection. one hospitalized patient actually test entirely negative spike protein antibodies despite getting doses finishing series month before.

The trials relatively healthy people whereas real world you’re using much older people, people immune system disorders, etc. trump got vaccine moment could still follow him. Omg forgot gym. got 2nd dose Saturday trying think things wait family receive theirs. (We live different states) symptoms son?  say is. studies reports anyone using it, one shows miraculous results vs. COVID. impression get drug time? 
Maybe gets relaxed going forward though. 
Interesting affected two days though. 
I anecdotal experience Pfizer / Moderna friends / family worst anyone 24 hours chills. brother law unemployed sits home watching TV day completely freaked virus day one. barely leaves house, meet anyone indoors, meet outdoors wears two masks, etc.

At point he's one adults friend/family group vaccinated he's outlier. house guests, going dinner, going out, hugging, basically back normal, he's left out.

In weird way seems like it. gives certain kind status last word if, joins gathering. makes ""special"". Honestly going see long takes get vaccinated. completely understand psychology it. 97.6% chances becoming communist Really? Danish friend mine told theyll enough Pfizer + Moderna reach goals ""We""? Yeah getting hand stupidity Well lot things didn’t know year ago. Taking extra precautions silly. know aren’t going get covid pizza delivery box Wasted opportunity use LeMao looking much better thought two months ago

Well, always thought (based publicly available data planned deliveries) would situation like Q2. Sure, extra Biontech deliveries make better expected, honestly expected AstraZeneca CureVac, things cancel bit. Thanks sharing sorry hear that. 
I’d take shot like day weak means gaining immunity potentially deadly disease! saying “person got cold” wouldn’t generate traffic. I’m reading stupid shit. said outdoors—little chance spread, esp. kids masked That’s odd... Florida seeing surge cases following Spring Break? thought already proved restrictions don’t matter, already herd immunity likely anyway? Huh, deniers? ""for reason""? heard Stranglehold? wholeheartedly wish acceleration vaccinations continue Germany (and countries too) predominant topic r/coronavirus July reopening borders countries instead hiccups wave-x resurgence. wife haven't. Still eating inside restaurants, still shaking hands, etc.

Not interested acquiring long term Covid morbidities. (the reduction severe illness) quite case practice unfortunately. think it’s mostly trial populations largely younger healthier volunteers generally excellent immune systems. vaccine wider use see older people don’t build enough immune response deal variants still get severe disease, well people 50s 60s comorbidities coming severe disease.

I’m sure it’s still great reduction it’s definitely 100% seeing trials [no, would original trial, 90% efficacy 12 days, one explanation.

In tests later done Israel shown somewhat lower larger population. second Pfizer shot 24 hours ago. one side effect thus far. hope stays way. even read article? still get virus even full vaccination post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It’s like announcing you’re selling calendar current year October. Gonna useless months. Alternate viewpoint: getting past 50% vaccinated, US population pretty well protected covid variants, additional vaccinations booster available fall, safe end year. Phew baby gone easter Got second Pfizer shot 24 hours ago. side effects far. side effects first dose hope continues.

AZ relying contractors ones actually making substance providing full finish.

2. JJ Moderna also failed meeting supply agreeements. Vaccine production predictable.

3. AZ never committed deliver anything timeline. customers knew risks unpredictability AZ’s timeline.

Thumbs emoji factually true statement instantly contextualized article. feels like people sub looking things mad blame point. start ist soon final vaccination fatal illnesses caught? take time body build maximum immunity. like this? realize broken thought process is? try fix own/local problems instead looking around make sure someone else problem make feel better? Got first day. Happy small part ending. Die virus, die. would end everyone got vaccinated though, isn’t lie. Why? you’re vaccinated you’re good regardless people do. gotta say it’s refreshing see Canadians breaking politics rule once. Like seeing cops finally called Ned Flanders house.

Woov. thousands liked kind maths logic. even know question lol guess confirming i'm high risk, i'm still risk (albeit smaller) serious covid even vaccinated?


High risk amongst vaccinated population, extremely low risk compared non vaccinated. still risk factors previously. difference chance death covid almost non existent reason, thought vaccinated would put playing field regular person got vaccinated. 



If makes feel better much safer unvaccinated group. risk however miniscule really worry it. high risk group 99.99% protection death great. 


0.007% became infected (6000) 74 died. 84 million receiving dosages already. Honestly bigger threat flu want get flu shot come fall. 


With said booster jabs rolling come fall covid. short term gains. may seem expensive surface renege build sense coercion people longer feel, may motivated change policies circumstances dictate Oh yeah 110% there!!

As article points out, people discovered never needed office first place could 100% job remotely. idea return deal office, going back commuting... want it. blame them. *plEaSe* *rESpeCT FaMIly's PrIVaCy* Pennsylvania, two mass vaccination sites eastern side may useful add:

Moderna mass vaccination site Lebanon, PA (easy sign online): mass vaccination site: Terrible music, horrific personality FTFY going much better. per [official Germany gonna receive 57 mn doses Q2 BNT + Moderna. 16.8 70 mn adult population already got thier first jabs. 80% adult population wants vaccinated, everyone probably get atleast first doses within mid-July two vaccines. Whatever AZ, J&amp;J Curevac supply would bonus. 

Logistics capacities going probem. Vaccination centers carry 2.25 mn per week, 55000 GPs + 12000 company doctors ready vaccinate people.

Very sad people gullible open mind.

You everything protect pandemic. huge number give shit social distance wear mask . Refuse vaccine cz read utter nonsense Web.
I really worry world human race going.. Watch it'll mild case. Seems also go like countries Pfizer doses like Denmark think using it

I hope now. ordered 4,6 mill doses Pfizer population 5,8 mill.

We ordered 8,2 mill J&amp;J, really hope approve it. make exact case unvaccinated infections. many asymptomatic people getting never getting tested. Plus believe death count bit inflated many cases covid die getting counted covid deaths even though really cause. I'm older risk people get vaccinated sure really agree young healthy people still feel like need locked homes get vaccinated. roll complete? alternative theory. body (immune system, respiratory system, whatever) “messed up” way managed protected vaccine caught covid anyway, perhaps also means you’re likely type person liable suffer severe covid. 

In words, take 6000 people give disease remove vaccine equation, maybe 1500 end hospital instead 400. understood joke - point *still* cost tens millions. that’s point, long run, it’s even benefit light years ahead means rest world lags behind variants go rampant. Stanford study yesterday says masks useless dangerous Statistically speaking generally is, even people risk groups. mean unacceptable risk severe illness death. Every adult house vaccinated. spouse worked someone temp job 1 day turned covid. symptoms day everyone worse masks. spouse eats lunch car exposure wearing mask.

Now parents live nearby usually see several times week see us exposed. parents vaccinated, vaccinated. took covid test taking forever get results. Since allowing us come parents have, gone dinner, gone shopping, hung new neighbors house, unmasked workers home. god forbid see grand son might plague rats. everyday get small child says ""I want see gram gram poppy."" Yesterday said comes back negative still might comfortable also get tested. got J&amp;J. got symptoms 12 hrs afterwards. got shot Thurs afternoon. feel normal Sat afternoon. someplace Sat night would've gone. interesting seeing different people react.

Dr Jerome Adams, former surgeon general, anesthesiologist. expert disease progress, epidemiology, public health. unqualified role unqualified advise nation coronavirus pandemic, really. 

My feeling public health officials, Dr. Fauci included, followed known science also protecting already overwhelmed healthcare system. people still stockpiled selfishly bought supplies, including PPE. imagine message maybe masks help, maybe do, please leave healthcare workers? would worked. 

There lie confusing others insisting was. people refusing wear masks follow public health directives get vaccine felt ""betrayed"" argument holds weight. petulant, users pointed out. disappointing depressing. 

If continue path developing C-19 variants, things could (and likely would) go even sideways far, higher death toll we've already faced, traumatized healthcare workers essential workers, national distress/trauma/poverty. need read around statement “this new hoax” understand “this” meant Democrats politicizing handling COVID saying wasn’t taking seriously. state talked seriously handling COVID. he’s calling virus hoax, would saying he’s taking seriously?

There also lot pandemics human history social connection never went away. 

Some people take time, 3-4 years, doubt run someone still always masking up. kids can’t get vaccine yet. I’m going back normal everyone choice vaccinated it’s fair don’t option. Would go travel country haven’t started vaccinating anyone access vaccine? curiosity, one get it? I'm getting first dose Thursday I'm worried work next day I'm sure denied disease existed. definitely worth keeping eye on. course not. I’d never shame someone safe...but think it’s net negative anyone try ensure everyone overly cautious. need encourage vaccine promising normalcy. Otherwise nobody get it. It’s choice continue safe, words matter making others feel like post-vaccination things won’t change bad forget Jon Voight. researcher likely extremely healthy.
There debate whether masks make harder breathe: design increase effort required obtain oxygen needs pulled filter. Many people healthy lungs either sedentary lifestyles health problems. grandmother example cannot walk flight stairs without struggling breathe, mask could catastrophic. extreme case many people experience discomfort able obtain amount oxygen thats completely normal.

I'm arguing practicality popular argument flawed disregards valid problem lot people. goal achievable within next year two, all. can't wait get back normal.

...I like, damn...you're right trust word comes Russia. I'm saying vaccine effective, believe claims unless they're coming reputable source outside Russia. yeah, noisy anyway send lovely real get well soon wishes. Alright smartass. list now. What's preferred beverage? ""I got Chinese shit.""

Fuck way off. Christ. There's here, certainly worth keeping eye Exactly came say, wth morons... Damn that's true highest vaccine yet.  Nice rant idiot doesn’t understand statistics say reason get vaccinated 5G antennae kicking /s May receive much sympathy given. I'm upset this. husband came COVID one week second vaccine, get it, asymptomatic. took care home stay away him. 

We waiting lingering cough go away reschedule vaccine. Yup. companies paying rent want staff back office guise heightened productivity team collaboration. many symptoms. felt like hit truck two days, felt less better except mild annoying cough lingered another week so.

I definitely symptoms 10 days ever close point felt like needed medical attention.

So, definitely possible symptoms 10 days also mild case.

Mike Osterholm mentioned last [Covid-19 (in broader context people concerned side effects): want point out, though, one thing that's happening right concerned people, understand why, it, too, really, truly minor reaction vaccine. what's become really known covid rash. usually often occurs first around injected arm first got vaccinated. people actually see become much widespread type rash across body. even people report kind feeling inside mouth. say, Dr. Esther Freeman colleagues Journal American Academy Dermatology published last week entire series cases rashes resolved own, could assisted either basically using steroid creams antihistamines. bottom line conclusion happens first time, go ahead get second dose anyway first dose, half second dose all. get much milder case it. surprising ACE2 receptors, receptors critical virus basically attaching to, actually very, frequently found skin. would expect see kinds reactions possibly happen. want reassure everybody, big challenge. surprised need use steroid creams antihistamines. Still, go ahead get dose. indication vaccine response inadequate much, reaction happens people. envy memory. truly do. 

I'm stuck remember shit-heels basically long live. No, basically insight question long Covid understanding breakthrough cases based limited, preliminary data. require study. isn’t matter interpreting way findings reporting. It’s matter interpreting data available. quite well versed interpreting statistics, thank you. know talking about. never heard anyone would take seriously say social distancing would end month two ""6-12 times already."" supposed quarantine ten days symptoms develop covid. long fever free 2 days without medicine symptoms generally improving unlikely still contagious. 

Not wait long get tested.

Gotta hope push 65+ 85-90% vaccinated make it. Either Pfizer trials children go smoothly larger pool eligible make it. think guidance 7 days exposure though rather 7 days symptom onset warms heart. Trump deserves credit getting vaccine quickly! also...the vaccine rushed can't trusted!

Obligatory /s Terrible sure warrants entire world hiding homes indefinitely? think anything bad really. “The CDC said people tested positive, mild symptoms, treated coronavirus wait doctor-recommended isolation period getting vaccine.”

Oh. I’d seen 90s never cares specifics cus I’m American didn’t effect :-) “I thought dying...” doesn’t sound mild. 

Maybe dose Wang Dang Sweet Poontang lessen symptoms. research admittedly pretty surprised learn effective vaccine is, doesn’t best variants like South African variant (which concern, believe around 10%) amazing job preventing serious illness/death.

Check study Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine induced stronger cellular immune response elderly adults BioNTech/Pfizer first head-to-head comparison two vaccines, scientists discovered shots elicited antibody response group over-80s, tested five six weeks first shot. **However, participants received AstraZeneca jab likely also T-cell response.**

Seriously, that’s *impressive* people know this.

The blood clots little concerning, it’s dam rare benefits absolutely outweigh cons. I’m thinking millions people missed AZ vaccine this, people could already antibodies t-cells already produced. Hope AZ gets back menu it’s solid. Wow idea could convinced think even less him. gross fuck. got first Astra yesterday, *think* I'm feeling symptoms keep hearing reported second shot Pfizer Moderna. So, I'm curious reaction shot number two going be, get all. think 2 months enough vaccimes available make moot point gone gutter cremation foot paths one state big cities healthcare lot pressure.  least government handled whole thing reasonable competent way. shame can't get vaccinated yet I'd honestly rather swimming covid here. you’re interested might clinical trial open could enroll child in. I'm still seeing stuff like Facebook.

""I'm experiment!"" Instead finishing week early, school decided give monday friday another week call 3 day weekend despite fact professors still assigned work weekend many students already classes friday. many 135 million exposed virus getting vaccinated? plays major role determing success rate vaccine. Suppose, 135 mil, 100,000 exposed virus 6000 tested positive, brings percentage 6%. denying vaccines work, saying bit misleading. Covid-19 causes death = sleep

Covid-19 make pee pee soft = ReAL sHiT anyone got vaccinated died covid trial? slept like 12 hours that’s actually want means immune system responding beefing up. Honestly, I'm sure guidance soonish though.

We need get vaccines skeptics sign vaccine, they're already normal life.

Convincing COVID end everyone gets vaccinated might carrot need. wonder causes small number. genetic fluke immune system? likely error administration vaccine? Like number 6,000 people accidentally receive saline nurse drunk squirted air notice? Know mean? hypocritical? Pro choice option get abortion not. 
The vaccine matter public health, choosing get vaccine put people risk. high survival rate mean people want catch it. 6k 135M.

It's fully vaccinated cohort. number 84M. wont know sure almost impossible know unlike actual clinical study, control group. said, method runs massive issue assuming equal parts vaccinated unvaccinated, cannot lol. know sure, guess, probably closer 99.999999% think 99.9+% safe covid... Either vaccinations work order stop transmission (they do), continued masks point *zero* capacity restrictions, including places masking occur, make sense, enough, case large maskless gatherings safe. it? would frustrating shoes. country approved AZ, I'd probably choose wait Pfizer/Moderna. outlier chance side effects, much less effective job/lifestyle affords ability keep hunkering extra couple months. Covid recovered 3 weeks ago. Moderna #1 last Friday. 30hrs. 
Not bad Covid symptoms, 100.4 couple hours (no fever Covid), muscle aches, fatigue. 

Latest research suggests additional benefit #2 shot me, still planning sticking schedule unless verify that. Come friday I'll get jabbed first available needle.

Maybe make sure got vaccine first. 99.999%

Definitely number. We've 120k deaths since Jan 31st country. time, equal parts vaccinated unvaccinated people, 1 death efficacy truly 99.999%. got least 3 extra 9s, probably 4. sacrifices people made general good all, includes parents especially anyone else high risk. near zero chance serious illness death. definitely zero, pretty damn close. vaccinated skew much older (so far), generally higher CFR?

That's almost certainly huge amount it.

Senior citizens vaccinated around 80%, think 39 vaccinated like 15% so.

I sure numbers changed since last saw it, saw numbers long ago, can't different. Right police allowed murder black people actual social issue... Conspiracy theories not. Hey man exact thinking ever since vaccine came I’m finally getting shots point don’t wanna test positive miss events.

Have seen mass reinfection India? isn’t hard thing monitor reading post completely wrong. 78 / 6,000 = 1.3%. 1.8% figure america whole, aka 500,000 / 30,000,000. odds dying, depends many number vaccinated? really matters. 3 year old daughter got covid around Christmas, days first dose. asymptomatic give wife (who vaccinated). little ones less likely symptomatic less likely spread it, vaccine may really done much you. India soon next, Modi hosting reelection rallies going Disneyland fully opened June 1.

that's bet. definitely worst 80s 90s, tourists got better first Germany Australia China bumped us ""worst"" spot (IME).

It mostly ""the masses"" get enough money start traveling internationally. new, people carry attitudes them. becomes usual familiar, people care responsible tourists gracious guests.

Also Americans spend lot money tourists that's often welcome.

I've traveling decades I've tons people recent years tell much love American tourists, detest (other nationality) they're rude. US higher mask compliance rate UK. AstraZeneca production problems completely unrelated supply issues. AstraZeneca massively overpromising could produce yield issues factories causing significantly produce less expected.  Various groups people routinely tested whether show symptoms not, work healthcare ezample, give info. yes say probably underestimate makes sense reason why. also going tomorrow, much lot? reality almost countries clue exact numbers. Either long find out, might ever even know exactly exact death toll. Wonder many people get vaccine fire extinguisher kitchen. 74, far. variants cropping dispersing throughout world, I'm fine holding little longer. India Brazil incredibly concerning need another month two know brand new vaccine going provide decent efficacy virus that's going lot mutations changes due rapid spread.

Also, death actually least concerns. Death inevitable, come time, reason. Quality life, hand, something entirely different, worse death deteriorates much. 

COVID blood disease contracting rolling dice going interact particular makeup. know, yet, particular person's biology immune system leads wide variety outcomes. could almost reaction...or could committing months, years, sickness. There's many cases ""long COVID""; losing sense smell/taste (absolute hell someone like me, cooking main hobby), chronic fatigue (I'm active), brain fog (I'm developer, need wits me), headaches. list goes on. know guy town lose arm due blood clots. neighbor oxygen 4 months later. Another friend move town ravaged lungs needed lower elevation (couldn't breathe well longer).

You casual masking, there's single activity need badly I'm going increase risk contracting Russian Roulette disease, possible. I'm going see vaccine rollout does, meantime keep distance, keep mask keep things lowkey know see community spread drop low transmission levels. vaccine cracked be, much longer. personal risk tolerance, I’d like wait little bit longer vaccine rollout I’m heavy respiration activities indoors.

I'm little uneasy people saying 'I'm vaccinated, time get back gym/bar!' many yet vaccinated. Although safe, people this, less safe unvaccinated are. direct level, could talk could transfer virus surfaces touching them, even need worry. indirect level, harder yet-to-be vaccinated people respect safety rules social media feeds full vaccinated friends blissfully back normal.

I feel right without mask roll-out almost complete. understand article usage fully vaccinated means. idiot neighbor caught corona, symptoms started 5 days receiving second dose, likely infected around time received second shot. Moron follow precautions whole damn time, gets shots early works Healthcare, manages catch corona second dose would effective, says vaccine work. Argh. Maybe would supposed get exposed passed effective period.. takes 14 days second shot reach full potential. clear stupid article whether patients like neighbor reached 14 days post second dose. Europe major problems producing Astrazeneca, going huge quantities it, Indian Covishield stuff think Europe help. stereotype/partial truth longer valid believe Chinese seen worse tourists. Russia best researchers field. surprising able produce product par best west offer.

It's also surprising can't make enough it, playing games supply.

It's like asking mob get paycheque you. concern cheque. one's pointed yet: probably masking absolute easiest mitigation measure. probably inconsistent scenarios under, following principle low-hanging fruit. Nailed it. People speaking experiences nothing else. wife got different vaccine. I've talked people got one got ass got handed them. talked people got one got felt nothing, surprised absolutely destroyed days. There's range here. one end range (outside super rare cases) feeling pretty damn miserable days. Risk feeling miserable days getting hospitalized miserable weeks. That's choice. 
I think pretty safely ignore anything Russia. point people left refusing get likely ones dont ability comprehend data Yeah.

Anyone that's looking Israel's pattern expected surge would relatively short start dipping back soon vaccination caught level spread caused people pouring back outside world common thing. Good governor common sense. get second shot Thursday I’m taking two sick days getting four day weekend. fully prepared nothing enjoy it. went little bike ride two days first shot end causing fatigue, figured take easy 2nd one. How? OK 50% population already vaccinated. going tell 50% Uk extra special high priortiy serious asthma?

Or ask believed website? 

Doctors can’t always tell children likely become seriously ill COVID-19. vaccine lower chances serious complications. It’ll also help protect older adults around high risk. weird. understand asking *if* got vax, *why* got it. 

I wanna hear they've got gout something. 

You jabbed? Yeah? Cool beans. liberty people exercise 2nd amendment bill rights full without unreasonable restrictions.

All liberties costs, shooting tragic, better dangerous freedom safe tyranny. Perfect! 😃 Social lives, travel, exercise, good working conditions, dating etc.

And willing important. feels like slap face can’t get vaccine get won’t get it, prolongs situation. Really fascinating many thanks! Day 7 first dose, kind hoping it'd steady incline immunity, hey, suppose still wait three days :) dozens! DOZENS say! 😊 Smart move covid bad move student mental health say lol. means heading back restaurants pals, hopefully local movie opens soon, least time Black Widow. die covid-19? Remember everyone playing politics said need stop flights China? young healthy (partially) vaccinated. come get me. We're lowest cases since May 30th. continue one top vaccinated states (first dose) know cuts transmission rates. There's enough community spread + time (given impending vaccinations) another wave. get exercising caution reopening, feel like CA could go full FL even matter. Exciting times Californian. Summer going incredible. Mix cream soda... crowd unmasked, reckless people endangering everyone else area peaceful. followed continued following test subjects. People dying vaccine anywhere near rate people dying COVID. like saying people died wearing seatbelts, it’s probably better wear one. total deaths per capita goes NY, NJ, MA, RI, MS, AZ, CT, LA, SD, AL Get fucked. doc warned might test negative doesn’t mean vaccine didn’t work me. results positive, though. lab report says “covid antibody spike protein quantitative report,” guess measured level antibody blood rather Cells? (IANA scientist, obviously) PCR's achilles heel incredibly time-consuming. breath test lacks sensitivity makes expedience. Protected something barely affect something ruin life find long-term affects damaging? Remember, game, can't respawn new body ruin one. pharmaceutical companies friends neither politicians, doctors, hospitals donate pretty much them. bandwagon jump on. mean true. 

First testing vaccine year now. started testing vaccines back March 2020. pretty much studying risk vaccine long COVID.

We 300k least excess deaths 2020 versus average year. want think mostly COVID related idk tell you. 

The widely publicized vaccine death week received vaccine. last point make sense either. obviously counting vaccine deaths 2 days vaccine. also 1 death 6 million J&amp;J vaccines arms. vaccines 95% effective, COVID much harm unvaccinated children, would vaccination required anything all?  lol. kidding? ""insurer"" lol? Wow deaths seem really low!! exciting!! Lol look man like China last year. Hey, good bad news! Got second Pfizer today! Arm sore little tired good. 

I found drinking lots water helped moving arm helped reduce stiffness. form normal coming back.

But many jobs come back.

Companies longer going spend much money travel. Zoom new normal. fine, stay away restaurants cafes. Huh, never even heard that. something people doctors sometimes recommend it? Either way, shouldn’t still considered fully vaccinated count? Thank Mr. Biden wonderful administration brought us bleak four years. Regardless doesn’t matter wear masks short times stores crowded areas. don’t even think twice time. It’s really big deal people (with non greasy faces least).

Do job?  20% population doesn’t want it. Lol Thanks , hope world see vaccines USA immunize citizens . China prioritizing short term gains soft power anything else confidence vaccines seems really low Latin America. American indifference may better strategy rushing people see second-tier vaccines developing world state? Good know then, might going soon. Right... I've wearing KN-95s entire time. one last months careful wear fabric mask top. looking specific areas mentioned..... high.  ... comparing states. New Hampshire even smallest state, 10th smallest. beating others nevertheless. Plus mean feel like talking percentage population pricked, pretty even comparison across board. US one solid theory behind it, well hopeful early results. agree. someone orders interprets tests tell separate reporting system place breakthrough positives. work second largest healthcare system wa state. check box order asking they’ve fully partially vaccinated get positive case looks different unvaccinated one. -dead silence- know almost twice entire population US gotten one vaccines though right? mean would know serious common side effects. 

I guess long term SEs theoretically possible, know sure long term effects getting Covid people got year ago. seems way riskier get virus vaccine. India? I’ve seen ton people get second dose, come clinic 7-10 days test positive covid. 14 days post vaccine critical! main motivator people point promise going back normal do. reason goes like indistinguishable placebo full effect like day? I’m sure would expected that. suspect effort inoculate Americans embassy Ecuador would cultural disaster. would breed much anger resentment among Ecuadorian citizens, especially light already perceived Vaccine Nationalism States. already sense injustice American immigrants, never paid taxes here, get full rights social services healthcare: retired Americans even get refund IVA tax they're senior citizens. Right wrong, perceived wealthy enough fly home want. would diplomatic crisis grave proportions got access available even doctors vulnerable.

If America wants help citizens here, invest Vaccine Diplomacy. rising tide lifts boats, that's way end well. there's American-only line vaccines embassy, guarantee pelted rocks. up, yes, like 1.5x 2.4. Even less look 7 day averages. Calm down. Could part due random chance. 

This virus appears spread part stochastic super spreader events. unlucky chain 2 3 could result virus spreading 1 person 100 weeks time. spread one person two new hosts rate spread could take months. mention endless pictures people getting shots exactly play well needle-phobes either. Yes DC still one. super annoying. director, Barbara Ferrer, said five current Covid-19 outbreaks involving schools — three Santa Clarita one Redondo Beach Agoura Hills — “all associated participation youth sports, attending instruction school.”

What odds they're charter schools? People truly fucking idiot creatures (FTFY) think terribly underreported. work primary care provider one calling telling positive. check box test form asking they’ve vaccinated procedure place report breakthrough positive. last week coworker fully vaccinated developed moderate symptoms tested positive. reported differently. think vastly underestimated. Based health profile, Covid seems less risky vaccine point. may change long-term side effects known. travelling seem picky. would imagine they'd allow it.  Rob Ford, crack-smoking mayor Toronto 2010-2014, died cancer 2016. I’m interested see confirm infection. I’ve fully vaccinated since January tested positive last Friday curative kiosk (required school, completely asymptomatic). next day tested negative different test. feel like false positive still asked quarantine city’s department health. wonder I’m accounted numbers. Hmm seems coincide certain person leaving job new person taking Assaulting people stealing money. like happening 'conservatives' right world worse worse managing economies. Example example example. we’re getting boys Like airplane? play Pokemon go... Best worlds. spike little bit, least Michigan. tho call CDC hypocrites. crack head guy Doug Ford's brother, Rob. Doug drug dealer back day, though. think you’re missing it’s 1% 5% would normally gotten without vaccine. think number you’re looking .01 x .05, .05%. I.e. chance dying group vaccinated people last several months .05% would same-sized group people unvaccinated stretch time. friend going get vaccinated finally got otherwise would quarantine work ten days leaving state. think there's gonna shift towards stuff going forward want folks get pricked. fully vaccinated need wear mask outside sure even go vaccinated friends houses party want. one stopping that. Go enjoy man. Fully vaccinated means enjoy public indoor places wear mask. That's still researched. certainly seems infectious complacency gp systems played huge role too. 

Will wait till results come. Why? 50%+ adults least 1 dose (which 70%+ effective already), least 10% country convalescent immunity, we're nearing summer seems least benefits covid.. bit rise due spring break loosening restrictions, LOT reason optimistic. Thank you! It’s really hard hate And, ""foreign"", Bolsonaro specifically means ""Cuban"" (Israelis OK, apparently) live PA people still wear masks outside. Depends groups friends people bubble yeah hurt wear mask. hurt. It’s bittersweet means people getting it, keep expanding eligibility. Get vaccinated people OK, say you’re rejecting CDC says instead calling hypocrites deliberate misinterpretation they’ve said mean comparing new Hampshire states like New York, Flordia Texas seems kind redundant. I'm sure whether I'd call Bay Area second best part U.S. SoCal third best. depends I'm feeling Hawaii given day.

With Silicon Valley money, ready early retirement soon enough, though, live wherever want. golly gee think personal choice comes in. see vaccine safer, people chose potentially getting COVID know risk. Breakthrough infections pretty rare there's huge mortal burden get vaccine, though small one. two died getting Pfizer vaccine trial. There's zero long-term data Covid vaccines short-term data reported exception immediate same-day reactions. Thanks participating trial though. Prudence fear

With due respect, point, is.

Nothing saying wrong, risk _massively_ lower vaccinated. I'm going back living life I'm fully vaccinated, aware vanishingly small chance might infect someone else. Novavax trial participant here! They're starting ""cross over"" participants week (giving everyone placebo group vaccine vice versa - they're instead unblinding monitored long-term immunity), head trial site mentioned started that, meant Novavax preparing send phase 3 data FDA review EUA. meanwhile country still vacinating 1 100 people havent finished 80+ year olds least get blood clots johnson permanently jabbing Nice Watch learn Canada. small fraction population. surprised. hey, might well give something really downvote:

Normalcy bias timeless affliction. People want believe already. really like hear really 50% mark. global pandemic takes years resolve. I'm sticking caution. I've pretty much spot far predicted would play out, I'm change change population large thinks I'm overly risk averse. They're reason even bad currently. Similarly arm start hurt 3-4 hours 1st dose fatigued next day.

Both times got flu shot previously arm hurt quite bit almost right away actually bad.

2nd dose Pfizer week. got bunch Advil edibles standby. “Fighting democracy” lmao

She fighting socialist agenda, assaulting ppl stealing money. 

She always terrible person corrupted party backing up.  Give us another two weeks, know? county mobile vans equity task forces busting butts. hired multilingual 'ambassadors' going farms, vineyards churches. traveling ipads register anyone get spot mobile unit them. converted water theme park drive vaccination. pop sites. There's vaccine center community college.  14 days. one left behind language barriers immigration status fears fear online registration. California way!  gonna party like rock stars July 4th! Agreed, depends location depending vaccine uptake. place like Bay Area, I’m hoping, never sees community spread again. 171 cases country 9+ million people pretty close I'm conservative enough temperamentally agree you, I'm board Newsom's relatively gradual re-opening plan. But, take solace knowing COVID might well behind us now. getting vaccine appointment first time I've felt hopeful seen light st end tunnel. 

now realizing many friends seem zero interest flat getting vaccinated, I'm wondering things look like 6 months. 😩 ur public health official / representative u choose lie , u risking ur credibility public future advice give them. get rock hard place Fauci made call say surprised ppl arent trustworthy him. know another reason tell us keep wearing masks rush get vaccines despite ur age group covid. 

Vaccines work lost lot credibility play CDC WHO. ID antigen test acceptable travel. Bruh talking anti vaxxers Lol knew bullshit start, along glove wearing dealing large amounts numbers data like that, always possible lil mistake. example recall reading nyt vaccine tracker prisons administered like 120% doses received obviously possible Imagine that’s case, everyone relative die within certain number days would trying get piece pie. lawyer commercials would put mesothelioma ones shame. would total disaster

Not mention would nearly impossible prove something caused vaccine. article, paper. couldnt really care less pharmacytimes.com misinterprets much get shit (and shit ourselves) screwing stuff up, America mobilizes, fucking *mobilizes*. hate age categories super broad. 1yo 16 yo probably different terms immune systems 25yo 65yo. Add kids school age social differences ages huge. Unfortunately, lockdown also negatively impacted large population country. Daily wage workers cannot survive lockdown. government provided basic food. Lockdowns beneficial large portion country worked remotely. ""not hospitalization"" actually mean? Like get sniffles sleep off, good go? India.
All adults eligible. i.e. approx. 910 million people. government buy any. vaccines manufacted within India, either Serum Institute Bharath Biotech. almost impossible locally produce large quantities vaccine covid sweeping rate is. 

It's good self-sufficient, comes time realize pride lead downfall. countries booked millions vaccines late last year, India unfortunately relied local supply fallen short. government spoken importing vaccines we'll wait see goes. AZ facing quite production issues Europe. supposed deliver 120m doses first trimester 180 second instead deliver 30m + 70m.

Thankfully Pfizer-Biontech increased production instead 200m + 100m optional 2021 deliver something like 600m 2021. family member like this. hasn’t gone grocery store since last March, won’t even walk outside house without wearing mask. Super healthy, fit guy (runner) definitely high risk. don’t know problem is. HIPPA gone window. Everyone team inquired got vaccine used covid-19 charge code work. It’s crazy. firefighter saw something fire, maybe it’s something haven’t encountered before, principles putting fire still work. virus pretty new, methods studied. need let fire blaze on. Whose liberty? 

The liberty people killed mass shootings one Indiana seems irrelevant that's shame.

*Edit spelling Lol course get shot.... recovered weekend enjoy festivities. Stay safe! remember mandatory states report break cases CDC. underestimate. special freedumbs homegrown variant Rona super-spread around. killed hundreds thousands people America alone

us intelligent people waited vaccine taking (reduced) risks. people bought uninformed rhetoric willing follow orders were. difference being, orders pushed political ideologues rather scientific understanding, thousands people followed rhetoric died horrible, preventable deaths. us half brain, waited till vaccinated even catch covid, mild illness us. Glad obviously okay, many people share views died horrible deaths it.

Make sure feel smug extra like died around feel smug anynore. Troll Ngl, don’t like Putin Russian vaccine well statistically acceptable manner, big deal help enormously Europe India. Really weird considering Trumps got vaccine January. You’d think that’d make voters bit inclined same. I've got 13 month old - gonna him. goofy two shoes crew still death glare.

""WE DEMAND PERFECTION!!"" Dude, even coös county, estimated population 31,563 2019, vaccinating pretty efficiently. straight boonies there. NH better get ready see lot Mass folks  Ok well see people wear mask outside. yes, city bound come within six feet people walking street essentially required. people see without masks likely tourists. residential areas wear masks. one gets little emotional thinking year ago sitting room wondering vaccine even work covid, US, everyone eligible get vaccinated, given 132 million Americans first dose vaccine effective spread covid. theorized since day 1. SARS too. anybody think keep is?! hehehe Virginia says show proof residency get shot. Anywhere Virginia vaccinating travelers? can't travel way back home state finals basically what's happening now. one really know irl really takes CDC seriously given antics early pandemic.

I appreciate work Fauci also part problem given playing politics last year literally lied public masks. understand done trust says point. Right seems like hot button issue young ppl / ppl already got covid vaccinated truthfully many ppl boat opt 'do research' trust Fauci. Frankly u lost trust public u failed ur job representing medical community. Ok lmao Soooo, acknowledging Taiwan's government policy far impactful population density? opposite arguments above? Pfizer Moderna vaccines cause mild flu-like side effects mRNA different vaccines weakened dose virus instead piece information teach cells make protein triggers immune response infected Covid-19? shot cause immune response thus side effects felt? means vaccines protect way panicky headlines work, people think want kill children now. required anytime leave house outside. live downtown. 

People wear mask. isn’t required tho. can't wait deaths. That's far thing keeping us semi lockdown. atleast week like 10 deaths day everything fully back ""normal"". Enthusiasm efficient vaccine scheduling. ""New normal"" term get buried soon possible. clear deviation societal norms, return societal norms soon. thats literally article talks about. 74 breakthrough deaths 6,000 breakthrough infections 84,000,000 fully vaccinated even good salad dressing similar experience coming back seeing completely different. Check post histories sometime. see some... interesting subs. clearly lot brigading. maybe could try hiding piece cheese? Downvote want, share logic: scheduled vaccination, contacted covid. Now, see real benefit vaccination time. Perhaps year two booster, like Tdap, though. Nope, 74 deaths even vaccinated people read article. “Out 6,000 breakthrough infections, 396 people hospitalized 74 people died, according CDC data released last week.” really risk tolerance. vaccinated enough many people stop caring.

I can't really blame either. 74 deaths vaccinated people? likely die tons things.

Definitely going keep wearing mask around others wear masks. sure vaccinated prevents spread. I'm somewhere nobody wearing mask I'm going bother either. Might Pfizer/Moderna vaccines mRNA J&amp;J adenovirus based vaccine. I'd love hear someone knows certain chime in. proceed put hands everything, suck thumb.

Fortunately covid spreads Nah; mostly line predicting. We're lot closer herd immunity US many think. See Newsom learned Amazon delivery service: underpromise deliver. People feel lucky, angry. game sucks? 3rd person less 10 minutes say exact thing annoyed say response. yes, 100%, might closer 99.999%, Seems like there's lot anti maskers subreddit lately. deleted crap 2011. Best decision ever Learning deal people good lesson everyone, even introverts. phobia meet people, preference recharge alone. scared could direct several groups campus could help- presentation practice wellness checks RAs every awhile. People suck, ways deal it. part growth learning too! Why? Republicans never do. Cool! still *some* cautious people sub, undeniable huge numbers extreme ""reopen everything matter what"" commenters. snarky me? mask mandate mostly keeping mask-free tourists wanted come ""free"" state thinking cool people think virus lie.

Portsmouth yesterday big sign downtown saying ""mask mandate still effect"" (we still similarly unenforceable city ordinance) state people tried flocking past weekend without masks.

Just make clear want dirty tourists respect way life decent one another *by choice*. I'm hostile person seeing rude tourists coming respecting us I'm openly hostile towards next month two.

Tourists, warned. kind come good manners like that. actually bit wrong snarkily copy pasted reply, 74 deaths 6,000 cases 84,000,000 fully vaccinated, 54,000,000 people gotten covid getting vaccine people died ages &lt;1-34. celebrating that, please tell age group needs vaccination. give herd immunity age group desperately needs majority Americans safe. 1% 0.007% vaccinated people. That's pretty damn effective. India exported ~65 million, inoculated 129 million. need word math teacher. test 100x much get 1% positivity?

There formula. Making one different making ratio first place. Well second jab feel anything sore arm lol. EUA approved technically fully approved can't require yet many cases. would guess since Yale give shit government funding can. says FDA official website FAQ's:

""A: vaccines protect viral illnesses also reduce transmission virus causes disease vaccinated. hoped case, scientific community yet know Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine reduce transmission.""

Personally due data transmission prevention inconclusive thus far, I'm gonna wait vaccines completed fase 4 clinical trials conclude vaccines prevent transmission.

Because matter twist turn it, risks involved taking medicine, simply yet know long term risks novel vaccines. Although ultimately believe vaccines safe effective, think healthy people actually need vaccine consider waiting seen people respond long term.

Due middle ground stance often get lumped anti vax category, find bit unfortunate. notice qualifier eradicated? I've seen first dose something like 50%-80% protection own. Also, hope son better. Yes. one unlucky whose immune system doesn’t react properly vaccine, also less likely react properly protect genuine Covid.

Essentially 1% deaths within 5% even get infected vaccine self selecting people sort immunodeficiency might much effectiveness vaccine itself. always exist people compromised immune function herd immunity eventually protect, skew statistics CFR among actually get infected despite vaccine. comment section dumpster fire. Thanks sticking it. trial, educated them.

Also, amazingly somehow able perfectly exemplify person a) misunderstands 3-phase safety trials b) vaccine safety general. I'd recommend research. chances bad vaccine going kinds trials low, better worrying getting struck lightning. think vaccinated skewing older would account lot it.

Overall result seems extremely good. past month, 25,000 people died COVID. 78 0.3% 25,000. Even month ago, least 10% population fully vaccinated, would (very roughly) something like 97% protection. thats literally article talks about. 74 breakthrough deaths 6,000 breakthrough infections 54,000,000 fully vaccinated mean, one proveably died vaccine. Nah. P1 nasty hope gets stopped. ripped NHL hockey team. *single* player practice. ~23 guys team think 2 spared. Team missed 3 weeks one hospitalized. we're talking peak fitness athletes. Don’t catch slippin’ tho go casinos win money, go experience. Going casino expecting win good thing.  vast majority Americans Canada don’t end paying American taxes, simple reason taxes bit higher, mortgage interest isn’t deductible here. don’t actually pay taxes US. I’m guessing it’s American immigrants Western Europe Australia/New Zealand. ""Persons leaving residences shall wear mask likely come contact another person, within six feet another person fleeting time.""

I'm sure part DC live in, area central everyone wears times outside, including joggers runners. maybe middle Rock Creek Park daily basis walking street? Yes. Washington state alone 10 people die fully vaccinated. effective 100%. thing happened one Spanish Flu waves. variant flu became seasonal flu decades that. single variant change trend. Every virus becomes endemic becomes less deadly time.  You’re welcome, come Scotland! guess using positivity % estimate amount cases testing. 

For example 1000 cases day 1% positivity lot different 1000 cases day 10% positivity. would think second scenario actually would 10x cases tested enough get 1% positivity.

Not sure I'm explaining mean clearly. burst bubble literally already exists society accepts risk. Check Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. people likely never fully recovered random infection give time, president lol blames libruls democrats creating Hopefully US government start massive advertising campaign spreads dangerous variants emerge. Michigan India seeing lot severe cases rising kids thanks variants. Coke deal different style pa business. Self employed. Wanting keep big govt peoples entrepreneurship! waited 10 days getting tested. He’s reason Michigan seeing spike. Things bother others wearing masks:
- can’t tell people smiling angry.
- hard time hearing them. 

I love able walk around block get friendly “hello” head nod.

Goldfinger said could play guitar 70s. people sites like redddit post every fucking thing says, instead ignoring A-hole. mean, follow film TV all, that's understandable always wondered feels real life cartoon sitcom character. Hope kids actually able get shots anti vax parents don’t hold back much. obviously people attitude won’t vax kids either. Face masks affect negatively, either physiologically psychologically. So, I'll continue wearing them. article (hopefully peer reviewed) bears debate. Michigan South North. I'll fucking say it.

Anyway hope recovers, also hope doesn’t get say see nothing.  Yeah, need leading zero percent sign, 0.009% efficacy. Man, wish Lucy Lawless would blast me... nonexistent sympathy. MONKE Same. I'm still wearing mask indoors even bother one I'm outside. always give people 6-feet. take stupid chances. Even vaccine, know chance get sick, get someone else sick, take needless chances. won’t get it.  anyone experienced body rash Pfizer? got 2nd dose broken measles-like rash thighs arms. barely itches it’s days becoming annoying. Nothing changed habits I’m leaning towards vaccine-related, haven’t able find much online saying sates opened removed mask mandates - citizens states continued follow mask rules social distanced choice? That's got surge? Also youre right saying “herd immunity” wrong. explained *if give vaccination people need death numbers would significantly drop. Instead spreading efforts age groups immediately* Meanwhile, Japan, even able vaccinate medical workers one extra person, you, breakthrough case, think skews numbers? would arrive conclusion? Maybe one day we'll nanobots work, needles do. AZ, got sick lil still worth it! People keep saying “live life like normally did” like feel like normal gone. also feel like don’t want go back normal. shit wage jobs working 3 jobs time anything important life. couldn’t afford school. can’t get education. also don’t healthcare many jobs provide it. hate labor crumbs.

I don’t want go back “normal”


I want go back “better”

“Improvement” 

Cool, virus could gone soon, what? Slave work corporations don’t give shit me?


Nah fuck normal.

I would care country closes forever.

It needs dismantled start anew anyway one unlucky get covid vaccination, still roughly 1 percent chance dying.

What they're saying chance getting covid drastically lowered, CFR still around 1 percent. arguing completely different thing, talking efficacy. person talking CFR, people infected factor equation, accounts **cases.**

Tl;dr vaccinated 99.95 percent less likely die covid. But, based data presented article, CFR breakthrough cases still 1 percent. I'm New Zealand, 2 week ban people India almost finish. wonder whether authorities extend ban try something else. can't imagine else try. Sister this, basically nothing second shot. Hopefully people take die pass virus stupid AF opinion telling us shouldn’t/can’t trust vaccines. Unless he’s strictly due age something fact says isn’t safe anyone, that’s really bizarre me. shots? Exactly. can’t expect people indefinitely live lifestyle. goal return normal vaccinated. question get there. Correct overwhelming majority people susceptible covid. question focusing 100% efforts population people need it? Handmaid’s Tale vibes? 

In seriousness, pretty concerning. Definitely think people know don’t think government’s messaging vaccines overly pessimistic part problem. Get informed. Read. isn’t opinion Moderna Pfizer vaccines prevent spread virus almost completely, it’s evidence shows. numbers show almost one receives vaccines acquires virus spreads virus. trusting science, fully vaccinated individuals able return pre-pandemic way living. public health officials state much order convince vaccine skeptics get vaccinated. literally feel like can’t go anywhere even vaccinations due fact many Floridians care masks vaccines. :( X3 Western countries. X5 - X10 others.   need get messaging help family. point something supposedly benefits random somewhere isn’t cutting it.  know. I'm there. said, people eligible seem signing get vaccines. people started becoming eligible within last couple weeks. Hence ""slow roll out"" comment. suspect China building stock, vaccinations could done en masse, rather slow trickle.  literally plan Trump. turns corrupt game show host doesn’t lend well emergency logistics. don’t think “high risk complications catch it” “high risk catching it” thing. One body’s ability really sick without lot functions breaking recover, immune system’s ability fight virus first encountered. 

Obviously people could disadvantaged fronts, weakened immune systems bodily functions debilitated partially debilitated.

But known risk factor obesity, don’t think inherently would effect either way immune function, right? Barry, get vaccine-resistant variants? Yes is, Barry. Yes is. India get tag?

it's exactly small place way understand first dose tells body look for, like handing ""Wanted"" posters COVID them. trigger much response, teaches immune system look for.

Then second dose shows posters... time, super prepared immune system notices vaccine wearing mask look like COVID... got injected *lot* it.

So goes full bore it, way never would naturally known actually caught real COVID. doses vaccine, would still learning recognize threat getting sick. caught one dose, body would recognize would produce ""normal"" reaction, actually enough keep people needing hospitalization. both, body prepared way COVID likely ever encounter (you're going get injected vial COVID) means try overkill *did* encounter.

And even *did* get sick, increased immune response would lower seriousness infection. That's separate stat vaccine would either prevent COVID, **or** least keep needing hospital.  really apple apple comparison...

Israel basically reached herd immunity 60%+ fully vaccinated plus 20%(?) already infected antibodies.

HK Singapore due diligence masking preventing spread. population exposed coronavirus. vaccination rates relatively low (at least HK, know Singapore).

Edit: Israel started loosening lot restrictions spike seen yet. Fingers crossed stay way. certain limited definitions ""real-world"" ""study."" Sorry bad experience luckily universal. seems spread. also bunch people symptoms. CureVac co-founder also said worldwide shortage raw materials aggravated US Defense Production added, however, vaccine makers seeking build production Europe serious disadvantage suppliers United States required Defense Production Act meet needs home market “Global supply chains disrupted,” von der Muelbe, Curevac’s chief production officer, told Rheinische Post interview published “Be chemicals, equipment, filters hoses: U.S. manufacturers obliged first meet American demand, means slipping list.”

[Vaccine supply chains disrupted U.S. restrictions: Curevac everyone symptoms hope get take days *and* feel fine :) proverb opposite ""Doveryay, proveryay"" good article explaining welcome less intrusive method compared nasal swabs. great example agreeable good thing. wasn’t great president, far it, current Covid situation far worse now. deaths, economy. Thing 6,000 figure cases know about. true figure likely much higher. understanding vaccines prevent catching Covid symptoms significantly reduced, vaccinated people might even know Covid, let alone report it.

So 10,000 unvaccinated people caught Covid, might previously seen say 5,000 strong enough symptoms get tested. 1,000 hospitalised 20 die. 10,000 vaccinated people might still catch Covid 100 significant symptoms get tested. 50 might need hospitalisation 1 dies. cases still 10,000 underlying people catching Covid significant difference 5,000 unvaccinated people strong enough symptom get tested versus 100 vaccinated people strong enough symptoms get tested.

So looking 100 tested vaccinated people saying, ""But one died CFR = 1%"" realiy CFR = 1 10,000.

So fairly compare CFR know true number cases. know figure vaccinated people many even know Covid now.

I'm expert plucked figures arse. Yeah, found ncov entered cells using ACE2, looked tissues ACE2 concentrated in, testicles pretty high list. far pretty much every organ ACE2 concentrated virus shown infect.

I'm honestly surprised Orchitis ED (It infects endothelium too...) rare enough bigger issue. Here's poll number comes I've seen media often misrepresents result. question worded ""Are *ready* get vaccinated vaccine Sputnik-V?"" implying current opinion. said ""no"" 37% worried potential side-effects 23% wait trials fully completed (neither answers implies hard ""no"", rather ""I'll wait see"" mood).

Also, perception compared Western Europe North America much relaxed attitude towards vaccinations (and doctor visits general). I'd say usual ""whatever"" rather specific mistrust particular vaccine. “Enjoy” pretty strong word Tennants! know feeling, missed lived abroad know said ""at least"", pretty certain MUCH, much 10%. CDC estimates [just one every covid infections officially reported. accurate, that'd put us damn near half country caught shit now. Zero hedge: Thousands vaccinated people got sick takes 2 hours clean every toy outdoor play session church toddler group. would massive help didn’t wipe soak everything.  bunch men insisting women simply must changed diets unknowingly, first time stress affected period past 15 years, mean anything ol' health issue mess women's cycles (as postmenopausal women cycles!)

I'm man completely sympathize you. experience women *know* something affect reproductive system. 

It AZ issues -apparently - affecting women men. got online fight good friend that. Yes, gaslighting insensitivity. think reaction based would happen actually get covid? yeah immune system kicked shit second dose. Fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, aches, swollen lymph nodes, list goes lol Pfizer, thankfully. got back January knows antibodies start drop off. We'll see talk booster Eh, know stereotype citing, woman surrounded types much suffering ED suffering getting laid they're better job impressing dudes us ladies. Well, also less little bit areas. We're lot bigger Israel results going vary more. still many every day? even possible now. don’t even. None fair way treat data Sputnik V tbh. second dose response based immune response; first dose teaches body got infected, second dose triggers reaction. kicked butt, means immune system really went high gear ""recognized"" enemy. What’s sad that, getting vaccine, still wear masks stubborn fools won’t catch it. 81% efficacy \*original strain\*. believed safe, new first kind mRNA vaccine..ring bells? I'm skeptical that. source learnt information credits 10th report Ministry Health Argentina vaccines Overall, Argentina seems positively react Sputnik V. late, true ""baby bust"" coming. lot damage AZ vaccine reputation self-inflicted. it’s turn mostly old sick people vaccinated roughly likelihood hospitalization average person. bad. We’ll see go lower young healthy people get shots. 

And many people shots covid finds hard “travel” person person, rates even lower right vaccinated people face unvaccinated people time. 

In fact, exponentially lower Like Brazil last year. South Africa using J&amp;J We've none one turning lots Australia, close not. get two vaccine shots J&amp;Jer? US citizen another country slower rollout, get vaccine? apply online, much it? wanted visit family I'm seriously thinking vaccine trip live South Florida, i'll lot waiting lol I’m pretty sure people would still buy test 99.5% efficacy. I’m suggesting replace official testing systems PCR testing. Check ""the sit-down Marshawn Lynch. Eeehhhh Using different vectors first second dose avoids immunity vector (the carrier virus).

When inject first dose immune system recognizes target pathogen (in case spike protein SARS2) carrier (in case adenovirus), so, use vector doses second dose injected immune system recognize attack diminishing efficacy vaccine. hand using two different vectors immune response first dose vector affect second dose vector. would wait case numbers area. US still stupidly high case numbers. vaccine help numbers go meantime risk still high, albeit much lower vaccinated. confirm this. It’s lottery gp you’re you’re asthmatic. called yesterday asked sent appointment. Luckily back tracked I’m early. asthma work primary school. one day? feel anything Monday? Please see [this means go hospital. necessarily mean going one day, barely hassle, bounce back kind thing. might days curled bed feeling like shit. might week. require medical personnel take care you. China disclosed vaccines effective (60-70%). vaccine numbers great, compare time period. 566000 entire pandemic, 78 time since vaccinated. think understandable offers lowballed, considering amount vaccines purchased many companies without even knowing they're going effective. Ultimately matter months population vaccinated choose so... timetable vaccines keeps moving ahead faster anticipated well. bad got J&amp;J shot last week. Regretting think intellectually honest compare number deaths number *vaccinations*. That's mortality figures calculated.

You go infections. CDC says ""fewer 6000"", let's call 6000 napkin math. 78 deaths, 6000 infections. That's mortality rate 0.013%. already impressive number right considering mortality rate US approximately 1%. way around - first dose ad26 second dose ad5 Ad26 first, Ad5 second. getting second dose later today CVS, can't wait finally fully vaccinated. know lot people talk doses know guys like hearing everyone getting vaccinated lifts spirits figured I'd check :) US done like two months means probably start mass exporting soon. Hopefully, rest world needs this. I'm tired hearing so-called medical staff officials speak immunity. led people lowering guard first time around look gotten us. zip lips, stop speculating handle issue hand right now. reach immunity reach it, hopefully another variant then. I've attended five funerals extended family last three weeks I'm tired officials speculating virus one fully understands yet. vaccinating kids they’ll spread adults can’t vaccinate (allergy, immunocompromised, etc). there’s sizable group adult knuckleheads won’t vaccinate. it’s either help world keep burying elderly, trickle vaccine try minimize bodycount. It’s selfserving ideal, generous perfect left barn long long time ago. started use Sputnik mid Jan since time reach 12-13% percents people ""vaccinated"" liquid. Countries like Israel, UK, USA, Slovakia moment whole process seen visible results number hospitalized ill people. see Argentina now? ~30000 new C19 cases Tuesday week. know report mentioned means efficacy visible results ""vaccine"". Currently road worried situation couldn’t get 2nd shot since would place. maybe coming close would give badly needed perspective this

The government basically shut everything giving impression won’t fully open everyone gets injection whose research rushed way quickly still fully FDA approved. someone skeptical government’s intentions pandemic, makes sense would think situation least little sketchy. 

Unfortunately little nuance conversation. It’s unfair skeptical big pharma government, corrupt serious public health scandals. shouldn’t blindly take vaccine (or undergo medical procedure) without learning understanding risk. 

With said, don’t see much risk really getting shot, got it. Hopefully vaccines (especially J&amp;J) get fully approved, otherwise gives vaccine skeptics stronger argument, good reason. Thank you!

Novavax might June now, damn shame. results cracking would great weapon spring arsenal. somebody downvoting say why?

It reduce symptoms hugely, article say 396 6,000 hospitalized (6.6%) 74 died (1.233%) Maybe already know this, people don’t I’ll add link explaining US hoarding vaccines, since it’s relevant whole contracts Trump signed Pfizer Moderna stipulated vaccines would used US. US bought needed, course, time nobody knew Pfizer Moderna would fail, buying meant one failed they’d still decent supply (not sure article said that, remember part happening). US stuck surplus vaccines they’re legally allowed sell donate due Trump giving F global health. Biden trying find workaround ever since took office (article mentions January 26 memoranda). They’ve tried renegotiate terms Pfizer Moderna, refuse change terms let vaccines used outside US. (presumably want able produce sell countries directly, profit)

So, basically US hoarding Trump, Pfizer, Moderna selfish greedy pigs don’t care lives stake. whole question “what Americans abroad?” kind moot point vaccines stuck Biden fix Trump’s mess, there’s good chance they’ll expire happen.

Either America’s priority vaccinating Americans, keep 100% production long demand exceeds supply) America’s priority vaccinating vulnerable globally, exporting nearly 100% supply (retaining small portion vulnerable Americans still unvaccinated).

Literally whole point relative. relatively close 7 feet 6 feet. 170 cases/9 million people close eradicated. India knocking 300k day right signs slowing Yeah can. thing ""pretty much done"" work movie ""pretty much"" over. completely. understand people struggling language lol Like, instance, wait GOOD film go cinema. old piece shit movie.

I'm pretty excited see *something* soon, figure maybe Bond Top Gun. I'd still wear mask ball games, outdoor concerts. Like article states (where large groups close contact). wife outfield seats people around us park mask.  flu likely cause death hospitalizations among minors covid. significantly contagious deadly flu. 

not vaccines. Yeah that's definitely big part it. Lots friends Bangkok get tested fear placed field hospitals. Another part hospitals rationing tests. tried get tested days ago call almost 10 different hospitals find one would test me. Cost 6000 baht (190usd), too. state 6M people, average around 55-60k deaths year. far, 6,600 died covid. 

Digging deeper, 22% 90+, total 54% 80+. Keep mind, average age death state US 78. we’re talking 3,000 people dead state averages 60,000 deaths year. 

I didn’t even include 70+ age group brings total deaths almost 80%. 

So let ask you, 1300-1500 deaths give take average age death state acceptable? Honestly, probably yes look annual WI death PA's case count starting drop now, covid19projections forecasted... CBD/hemp tobacco, contain nicotine. replacement good... current CFR USA 2%, think; consistent idea 95% reduction cases accounts majority risk reduction. mayo medillion club got vaccines way anyone. Oh covid shots available via private jet companies US . know first sentence false. flu vaccines well tamiflu anti-virals effective treatment. Flu vaccines approved every year.

Do source claim?

Everything else say either irrelevant wrong. kind dumb, completely played time, like comment ""Oh wow thing happened? Anyway..."" ""permanent"" restrictions talking about? heard thing. Well, Boston #1 rule Fuck Yankees, #1 better #3. 

Hope everyone get vaccinated us see Sox beat person &lt;3 wife works ER nurses gotten positive vaccination cases mild said would known tested again.  understand country clamoring get Olympics way, pushed faster vaccinations? 

Likely last summer definitely last fall, knew vaccines going way mess globally. seems strange they're far behind powerful incentive vaccinate sooner rather later. early polls showed something like 20% people eager take vaccine, 20% ""likely"", 20% ""probably"" rest ""only required"" ""never"". numbers varied various polls first groups usually added around 60%.

In reality looks like 70-80% 65+ taking it, far ahead early polls.

These numbers lot lower areas. poll October last Michigander here. permanent restrictions place here, I'm sure heard that. Probably place heard restrictions unlikely last 2021; whatever source information led believe we'd woods trusted. Meanwhile, many sources information saying we'd far year saying normalcy, something close it, months out. mention even layman put two two together; vaccines lower case counts/hospitalizations considerably, Americans vaccinated rather quickly, ergo... else line? gonna while. Anyone wanna friends 😂 Staying home ideal. lots people ever option. Wearing mask 2nd best choice. actually unable job, though? mean, jobs done perfectly fine 100% home, that’s case, make go in? job requires person work, doesn’t mean everyone’s does. Honestly, 2k active cases, wait zero. reason fuck up. Yep, same. frustrating cases continue go life continues become normal, giving people less less reason get it. benefitting work rest us done.

I tried hard get vaccine ASAP, frustrating see friends dragging feet getting it. Based results UK, seems like good approach. Fatality hospitalizations fall dramatically first dose, symptoms get much less severe. absolutely surprise all, fear mom suffering pretty badly (I think general anxiety, non related pandemic). always introverted nature would things like book clubs nature photoshoots group. Ever since COVID, locked house basically contact anyone year, except came visit. physical health issues limited (knee issues) still, worry re-entering society wanting all. months ago finally convinced air mail wipe groceries. Obviously I'm beyond thankful stayed healthy fully vaccinated, still tells scared grocery store told two friends (we fully vaccinated, CDC says gather indoors w/out masks) started grilling ventilation system apartment asking opened windows lol. feel sad her, like encouraged outdoor meal friend many places near us well spaced like ""well first I'd need friend know trust (name friend town) safe."" think ever unhappy home enjoys reading movies still, think made fearful anxious kind person person contact, worry COVID-19 re-entering phase.

Anyways sorry get chest, feel deeply anxiety around re-entering (I think small normal amount year cautious). Normalizing staying home sick would amazing. Masks sick would okay American put entire life hold 13 months, don’t think ever get past resentment towards people part prolonged pandemic unnecessarily. anyone believe anything comes Russia? Yes look guy responding point ""better"" health care rich people afford it.

That's wildly....reddit lol

As mentioned 90% Americans indeed healthcare insurance vast majority like whole narrative kinda falls apart. India easily hit 300k confirmed cases/day today.

So far, 294k today there's still hours go number expected rise.

The daily global record new confirmed cases broken last week, tied.

Meaning past peak pandemic worst still come. first January 31st March, India little 200 million new covid cases. first 20 days April, India 300 million new covid cases.

India trending wrong direction going turn catastrophe(If already). country opening vaccine eligibility May 1st help little bit probably cause lot chaos streets India. (Auto correct)

But would keep spirits isolated hospital Seriously really can't stress enough, fuck ted nugent. difference hesitant take one vaccine, completely morally opposed vaccines. important news Johnson &amp; Johnson resume shipments EU, several EU countries already received doses resume vaccinations vaccine. Moderna shot 2 rough (chills/fever 24hrs), get much immune system probably used many pathogens people do. Totally worth though I'd love get S.African booster shot soon that's available (Fall hopefully). SOUTH SUDAN - South Sudan health officials stopped administering 60,000 doses COVID-19 AstraZeneca vaccine past expiration date still shelf life least six months, according drugmaker World Health Organization. 

I don’t understand sentence. happened vaccines. Initially sort hesitant get vaccinated - really coming rational place, little freaked quickly came market since low risk anyway, wait while? friends started getting vaccinated know checking appointments multiple times day. mean seems lot viral load. seems crack treatment options 2014-2020 lol I'm excited take FULL advantage life moving forward!! talking American colleagues, even good insurance comes limitations, deductibles, co-pays would make Canadian's jaw drop. single payer, universal system means front cost health care zero, although pay taxes, one needs check bank balance go hospital. Cardiff it’s 30+ week, 18+ reserve list getting appointments. 

Wales actually well vaccinations. failed horrifically everything else crisis though. sounds like working policy pre early pandemic days

Most employers are. work F500 tech company discussing return office June. messaging they're putting everyone answering questionnaire (have sick recently? contact known positive? traveled hotspot?) every morning along temperature check, wants everyone wearing mask day office except eating, crews onsite constantly sanitize surfaces, hand sanitation stations everywhere, track movements office via badges contact tracing, etc. guidance straight last April. wait everyone vaccinated returning office dispense Covid Theater. see problem either. Yah 85.4M fully vaccinated today, means 0.007% vaccinated later got infected far! That's amazing news 🎉

Granted might variables many still practicing stay-at-home orders. 

My immediate family almost fully vaccinated still changed much lifestyles. Still stay home mostly, interact outdoors, still wear masks stores really send one person shopping slow times. 

This summer trips planned see vaccinated family members plan still travel way - masks visits look much like lives home. 

But excited dine finally! (That one thing never really vaccinated - outdoor dined twice beers chips salsa kept masks taking sip bite). 

Feeling hopeful things going back actual normal soon!! 😄 Anyone else develop tinnitus pandemic? Supposedly manifest/worsen due COVID-19. virus, realize time. ears ringing like month now, apparent cause. ear doctor find anything wrong me, plus hearing diminished (it's quite good actually). 

Has anyone virus happen them? ringing go away? I'm probably going get used this, figured I'd ask. mean, USA today ran yesterday: That’s great! Good luck Sounds like experience 2nd Pfizer shot. Still regrets, I'd gladly go again. idiot, sure isn’t cat scratch fever DC well. Isn’t majority Japan’s population elderly? remembering correctly? me. Shot 2 like someone punched arm, that's it. realize that. meant typically Tuesdays cases deaths reported Mondays. That's could significant US less new cases saturday-monday previous saturday-monday. Well, considering media running “[consider kids basically even recognizing kids aren’t underrepresented covid cases important point divergence major narrative past year. get enough Pfizer deliveries adult population Q3 still use months vaccinate seniors? 

Pfizer think “use lose it” policy countries cannot millions doses laying around. shit, forgot gusy that.lol. said would doses everyone September. Canada currently running 3rd G20 per capita rate vaccine delivery. ""really"", wonder mean like, *why* pre-existing condition make vulnerable? kind question leans full complexity human body, answers get much fuzzier less satisfying. Like ""why stress correlated cancer."" give bullshit ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ really know. Even then. risk transmission vaccinated orders magnitude lower. risk people's lives driving too. vulnerable chance get vaccinated long time now. Things wide open morality actions shifted since 80% seniors vaccinated. got mine yesterday (Pfizer). drank absolute ton water 36 hours later sore arm. agree rationale there's higher percentage people far unwilling get particular vaccines completely vaccination. Anyone railing MMR vaccine years lost cause, there's maybe 10 - 20% country may may get vaccine depending rollout goes public messaging approached. Calling idiots probably going bring around. Same. cases tripled spring break wait surge like Tex-oh. US tried quarantine passengers cruise ship army base like 14 days think way back March April last year. right pandemic first hitting massive lockdowns going effect. passengers sued get forced quarantine believe won. Texas never took virus seriously. open country vaccinated people. family Texas saw bars near full capacity early January. health officials especially appreciated inoculation involves single dose, making easier give vulnerable underserved populations follow-up appointment second shot could difficult. European regulators noted blood clots United States similar cases Europe among people received Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, also uses “viral vector” technology. AstraZeneca vaccine, EMA estimates risk someone developing rare blood clots alongside low platelet count 1 every 100,000 inoculations. Group 3 seem like biggest problem me. know people group.  I’m sorry what? why? Works fine me, Netherlands anyway 5 months later, definitely wrong! Israel conclusively proven this. Covid treatment free well. need insurance. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That's already antibodies system, get first shot immune system recognizes what's going kicks gear immediately. people COVID yet, moment come 2nd shot.

I assume anything 100% certainty though. can, make sure much going day 2nd shot. definitely misleading (probably good intentions), know \*false\*.

I tip boss wife able get vaccinated day. silently understood would mean couple hours clock! refer person getting stuff smoking from? gotta strong shit think states going actually make masking permanent measure. Truth. pandemic US one top top spread. soon get vaccines start warnings places weren’t place month ago got money manufacturing. mix vaccinations, continued mask wearing, people already immunity weather warming slowed spread, said Diana Cervantes, professor biostatistics epidemiology UNT Health Science think took gambles paid off,” Taneja, Tarrant County’s Public Health Director, agrees Cervantes. Tuesday, worried uptick virus’ spread. Friday, every infected person transmitting virus least one person, meaning spread also worried rapid decline cases, positivity rate hospitalizations slowed, could indicate something brewing. cautioned COVID-19 still community people continue follow safety believes, general, people taken virus seriously ditched safety measures. anything, lifting mask mandate made people want safer. March 10, people didn’t immediately take masks go back pre-pandemic times, Cervantes said. large businesses like Walmart, Target, Kroger, HEB others still requiring mask coronavirus protocols.

…  Remember Canada banned mass export prescription drugs Like stupid movie, fun. especially since able stream HBO max Translation: happened lot school district I’m from. 

A lot cases outside spread would safer environment, would back normal environment everyone setting also vaccinated. Eh, doubt it. likely require vaccination + rapid test boarding. perfect, plus much lower levels virus circulating (even true herd immunity reached) would probably make rare enough occurrence passengers worry it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  you’re protected vaccine infection, follows you’re likely demographic immune deficiencies, otherwise unable create protective response. people part excluded trials though many eligible. makes sense Covid still dangerous people. It’s essentially false CFR, vaccine massive protective effect general population, strong immunodeficient folk. 

You also have, like vaccination especially early days, visibility problem- extremely likely significantly breakthrough infections ~6000 CDC mentioned accordance ~92-97% efficacy Pfizer/Moderna vaccines have. many undetected cases, vaccine, massively reduced severity, point feeling like weak cold asymptomatic. I’ve fully vaccinated couple months test period. could well point would tested PCR+, especially since behavior become “risky” since (I see friends maskless, take public transportation [masked], recently begun going gym, things would considered prior vaccination). would get tested felt symptom whatsoever, average person, especially experience allergies, likely not. cases fly radar, visible ones end severe. similar situation early pandemic, fatality rate seemed much higher severe cases tested. 

There mechanism vaccine, fails grant protection, makes easier virus give severe infection, save ADE, yet demonstrated, either trials vaccines currently use otherwise. Maybe CDC results open question researcher, fully expect preprint exploring possibility ADE, society culture vigorous research would, now, immunosufficient, vaccine protective levels time. one barrier fails, there’s another barrier right it. hope helpful. 3 million people worldwide let sink in. teachers failed Honest question since don’t know much virology - evolution overcome UV sensitivity reasonable possibility? know UV light powerful disinfectant studying water treatment, evolving past strikes something would require major structural changes virus. Honestly, realize time. suppose leaders/experts intentionally emphasize fact, told back March would dealing COVID year, entire world would gone panic.

Looking back, obvious vaccine way it, time focused part taking month time. Ok Yes it’s given first days people hospitalized. countries strike best deals. Small countries like Israel make deals work, large ones. would look vaccination Asia - every country struggling vaccination campaigns.

Australia good vaccination efforts well. mostly rely manufacturing EU moment also forget 35,000 people alive. many people sacrificed order come back pleased? think one lacking compassion human life. Thank much triggering AGAIN!!!

We got TWICE yes, traumatic. first time business trip, years later think hitched ride furniture delivered house. times managed fight successfully, without professional help, taping shut affected room (after thorough cleaning) year. 

Every time wife think going vacation, flashback bedbugs stay home. also bought new piece furniture years. worth risk. Word. same. I’m going check hematologist first, I’ve already received go-ahead PCP doctor working infectious disease, I’d say it’s looking pretty safe perspective. Also fact hematologist wanted book virtual appointment in-person visit indicates aren’t even going want bloodwork me, she’s likely going answer questions tell shouldn’t concerned, time tell! Yes, many words like that. examples mentioned. Something almost eradicated like something almost finished closed. ""Closed"" much binary state eradicated. got mine yesterday around 10pm felt like hit truck. chills aches night, couldnt sleep all. completely fine noon today. weird. Mustelids Yeah, realistically vaccines going roll rolled out, regardless whether mouthbreathers Karens ignoring protocol. basically knew since last April going take vaccine end thing. fucking time. Universities fully back yet well. I’m exasperated.

Canada doesn’t single production facility, can’t reasonably expect vaccination program happen fast countries do. Honestly yeah, issue every single breaking Point I’ve rules end hasn’t really picked on. it’s month two today, there’s EXCUSE im gonna actually tell friends they’re wrong. yeah aren’t really restrictions needed vast majority elderly vaccinated Yep, unfortunately least half friends seem fall bucket. think vaccine unsafe anything. feel like need reason. Figures Lockdowns definitely work. Public health epidemiology science theory tell us work, do. issue practice, reality current western (at least) civilization culture, system simply won’t (or even can’t) perform lockdown correctly. ends shitty half measure doesn’t get job done, takes long, inevitably results premature reopening, starts new wave spread, repeat. 

So “under right circumstances” tall order lot time.  think I'm already desensitised weird ass news honest would say something controversial yet brave? English translation deliveries seem cut again. Sweden expected \~67 000 weeks ago, got \~31 000. Next delivery May, doses delivered June. 

The reason production issues US plant, Janssen doses distributed US currently imported Netherlands make shortfall, consequence get later. Small business owner here: didn’t qualify extra stimulus it’s super low income tax filers (and it’s 1200 - try paying rent 1200 la😂) grant waitlist since last year. grants prioritized low income areas minority groups. Still waiting.... AstraZeneca reduced, reduced reduced deliveries much impact reduced deliveries quite small. 

It interesting see J&amp;J deliver. I’d say solutions making convenient making required things. Like don’t make QR code need scan wear mask target August like require schools workplaces. advertising messaging shows benefits instead sort thing said social media masks vaccines like “do you’re idiot” we’d better. know based on, speculated think might be, decided bullshit? That's...an interesting way going could read actually care. That's really what's happening.

These counties turned political move, they're starting generate surplus getting far doses they're using turning shipments need official protocol. 

I swear sub reading comprehension third grader days first sincerely nice comment Americans ive seen website while. nice see people know us unpleasant. Coinciding uk's second dose....my gp 600 vaccinations Sunday most/ second dose. sir, wendy's guy replied to, got PAX 3 year ago **amazing**. mostly use flower concentrates mean clean basically every time pack it, right smells significantly better toasts flower instead burning better lungs. It’s reduction reduction reduced deliveries scheduled started feeling ""off"" 2 hours 1st Pfizer. hour 6-7, felt tired. felt fine next morning know US giving vaccines non-citizens, good know get grey-area vaccine. Even though marijuana legal many states, still gonna say aloud:

Don’t marijuana! mean?  Well there’s difference. similar term Amit masker, it’s vague use multitude situations it’s fine wear mask. anti vaxxers, consider people outright won’t get it. vaccine hesitant people, see people hesitant misinformed rushed something. lot people could convinced get it, one big limiting factors convenience hyperbolic descriptions feel shot. them, would ordered 50 million anything something approaching promising phasing 3 results back summer/fall.

Canada late party domestic production speak of, **something** going. still seems Japan even race yet despite trying push Olympics year. quote part even *claims* equally addictive? dumb ass missed even though read twice :/

I anecdotally vouch nicotine, itself, less addictive personally, vape, reduced nicotine really low level, exactly same, yeah...  could more.. REA DOA? Ha days news would ""AstraZenica asking EU vaccines"" No, I'm trying figure wtf meant original comment, hence asking. want see pandemic yesterday, comments like one wanted reminded curious follow. mean, said India would never even get second wave, recall lots people saying ""model country"" back Nov/Dev handling COVID minimal restrictions. How'd work 6 months later?

My point being, making predictions broad statements like ""it's \_\_\_ country"" ""\_\_\_\_\_ reached herd immunity"" wrong nearly 100% time, vaccine, set reminder know situation 6 months matches general tone thought going happen. followed CEO pilot inside look company instead 3 amigos. 2 characters much interesting required characters story. even redemption CEO shit Mechagodzilla. Read room bro get hook something hook strap together behind head. see quite people seems effective. Anytime need see specialist United States, still uncommon wait months (and living relatively small city significantly healthcare capacity would generally seen - city basically caters healthcare needs entire state Kentucky, capacity frequently underutilized) Yes - federal government (usually) enforce federal law state unless something major/wide spread going on.

Handing joints one thing. massive grow op purposefully distributing illegally/nationwide another. lack compassion dead? everyone gets vaccinated less cautious vaccinations, things get dangerous anti-vaxxers 

But succumbing virus nature intended Considering world able contain COVID, I'm starting think expectations could 'beaten' managed unrealistic. Wow that's pretty wild, hope things work you! people taking US approval after. disappointed didn’t see bonky boi movie. also becoming apparent younger demos feel taking precautions/vaccines necessary. Unfortunately complacency large part thing level global danger near future. ranking based on, exactly? healthcare outcomes? measure outcomes people go doctor know can't afford it? ranking systems fucking bogus. new reduction, reduction announced 3-4 days ago? often can't keep count!! expecting healthy people take unreasonable elevated risks protect old people goals different mine. saying vaccines dangerous, young people take elevated risk vs first getting covid serious illness, makes less sense take vaccine, considered data collected.

I think giving warning right thing do. Make people conscious elevated risk let make decision. still bit early keep score Ontario entering worst surge. Currently Canada 30 days behind US vaccinations catching up. enough vaccines give Canadian adults least 1 shot mid June. Canadians expecting normal summer. think Sweden considered good example longer. Even deniers. True, whatever fourth wave feels awfully restrained right now. Hopefully!  UK receive package leaflet receive vaccine (I anyway) also read bus journey home. guess, guess:

1: India probably never actually control first place.

2: new mutation might infectuous. Teh warning put leaflet whiuch accompagnies every type medicatie. information probably added section side effects. Compared pretty much southern Ontario, yes. Meth labs hours away Toronto Ottawa ending bidding wars going 400k, fucked. doesn’t change current situation. 100 million negotiated delivered around October December according article, health minister buying stock next year, corona vaccine expected yearly vaccine. super bowl result significant increment cases? arguments mainly related rural areas, ofc well counted everywhere specially third world like areas America. 2600 population 30,000,000 nothing 

Virus like sun, Florida sunny, DeSantis something right luck. find interesting talking past tense. Unfortunately still much ongoing. We're going deal people refuse get vaccinated near future. continuously learning value respect for. lack altruism exposed blatantly many people. Man. Az screwed. Breathing 2cc exhaust trapped half-liter breath going kill you. Every breath displaces entire contents every mask.

Oxygen levels lower wearing masks everybody talking about. watched eyes doctor wearing multiple masks going ham exercise machine blood oxygen monitors holding steady whole time. sounds like common knowledge either? quadruple 4 weeks people testing positive today take painfully die. Hard imagine 30,000/d dying virus could prevented rudimentary precautions. confirm - married Canadian seriously considered moving there. love Canada Canadians damn expensive live there. 1-877-Joints-For-Jabs, Get vaccine today  got 2nd Pfizer dose 2PM, symptoms stated 1 AM. advice hydrate, eat healthy, keep tylenol thermometer next bed, make comfy case.

I one felt symptoms everyone know far hopefully feel bad! get another dose? feeling austria Astra Zeneca.
According statistics many get Pfizer, whoever speak either still waiting vaccine got AZ. Rate survival young people good, young people vaccinate lot still get sick. I'm worried getting sick, I'm worried getting sick giving disease someone healthy. 
 
It important vaccinate order protect weaker members society, weak immune systems can't take vaccine medical reasons (it's seniors). Surely come test antibodies.

Should enough.  Garbage. misspellings alone enough author hang head shame. gross twisting actual \*good\* science author, completely mis-reading conclusions papers cited sources, shame him. Anyone buys ""masks work healthy"" result ""study"" sophisticated consumer information, best. particular party made test political loyalty. figure represents tiny fraction 74,000 people admitted hospital virus time period examined preparing hand findings Government’s advisers Thursday, showing dramatic impact first doses hospitalisations deaths. British thing remain such. even ok mix vaccines? Covid mostly spreads via workplaces.

And areas control social distancing.

Gov wants blame people.

But hard lockdwon mask mandates could stopped it. Go, Germany, go! aint carrying anything

The EU exported doses used vaccinate people.

How many doses US exported? IIRC, officially, 12-48 hours. anecdotally, within couple hours some.  Pfizer Moderna vaccines cause mild flu-like side effects mRNA different vaccines weakened dose virus instead piece information teach cells make protein triggers immune response infected Covid-19? shot cause immune response thus side effects felt? specialist Gamaleya institute, Vladimir V. Putin


Which operates Ministry Health Russian Federation. can't distributed stockpiling Poor countries like sa. Already gave stopped using az.

You think poor people gonna accept vaccines rich countries rejected. Buy vogmask essentially N95 one would know. Get one carbon filter. Californian company masks made South Korea meet KF94 could use N95 tell work deal it. doubt going check. put surgical mask hide really matters. True that. reputable experts Europe - also US, hold official government positions - made abundantly clear already around Feb/March 2020 COVID stay next 2-3 years least. Anyone claims thought would done months either incredibly naive, , likely engaged therapeutical wishful think prevent freaking out. Btw, others pointed out: fac working vacciness rolling massive scales **right now** corresponds absolute best scenario predicted experts year ago. remember like yesterday. Reddit would group fully vaccinated people hang still wearing masks. ""safe"". ""reduced risk"".  Australia largely contained coronavirus largely thanks mandatory 14 day hotel quarantine international arrivals, paid travellers. works. bad/wrong New York Post article it. usual standards. New York mess marijuana legalization rollout like Oregon did, there's much weed cause prices crash? probably friend many people summer haha.

I’m realist/pessimist though.

Oh well, it’s clear know one way out. “terrified” likely rational position take. People sending group chats huge insta account called Rap posted it. one recent states drop mask mandate ? This. wife same, side family understand hang holidays even though live city. relationship strained extended family took personally, even attempted explain risk management perspective. Makes sad That's 1 10 protected....

The good news completely define risk risk others, since even unprotected people dodge getting infected. vaccines help un way well less community. Lean wherever want unless train full don’t lean Got second dose Pfizer 2 hours ago. feel fine right I’m bracing worst. long usually take symptoms kick in? It’s still DC. You’d go “buy” used book guy truck 20$, he’d GIVE free gram weed!

Mine copy Jimmy Carter’s autobiography.  mean also semi insignificant event called presidential election entire government changed.

But yeah, sure. US fucked badly individual level, too. I'm really surprised done well vaccine rollout (all things considered). definitely better infinite money go brrrr visa ran current country, do? can't work. money. can't go back country make money legally can. current country demanding leave. supposed do? see. seeing this? basically PTSD. survival mechanism work great surviving stress life threatening events, find anymore? post traumatic stress(you need warzone). 

Sauce: c-ptsd.

That’s good. hope NRW rest Germany too. Luckily I’m visiting U.S. summer get vaccinated That's irrelevant point whether feel okay smoke after, whether affects efficacy. downvoters damn overreactionary. program mentioning (VICP), actually covid vaccines covered different program now, Apparently using program issues, [described people would rather covid vaccines use VICP. imagine happen post-FDA approval.

So actually looking up, walk back statement ""it's complicated."" maybe, maybe millions part they’re demographics old life expectancy quite high 85 iirc friends get joints? decent weed? think people optimistic/hopeful. way countries hit badly start with, initially mindset 'it affect us here'. relatives England think would happen them, despite fact COVID running rampant Italy time.

Then summertime, much Europe seemed relax restrictions lot thinking worst over. prematurely celebrating end COVID party.

I'm sure us took minutes research, could learn vaccine way out. tough year, perhaps many us (including myself) wanted cling hope get next weeks. friend told me, last summer, we'd dealing COVID June 2021. honestly even want think possibility time. Haha I'm saying method would eventually away sick days.

Oh, getting surgery? Well, take laptop get work done wait anesthesia kick in!  facing challenging health crisis time. case counts all-time high. hospitals buckling. Younger people getting sicker. disease ripping whole families,” letter issued Tuesday afternoon behalf group’s 40 doctors, medical professionals scientists variants concern dominate COVID-19 Ontario are, many ways, new pandemic, Ontario needs stronger measures control pandemic.” next round starts week like said, states dont even supplementary grant program isnt funded federal money  Would great schools larger enrollments started requirement. Ohio State, Central Florida, Texas A&amp;M... regular death rate much higher, 1.8% could make argument AZ, Pfizer approved months they’ve received million doses. Correct, wasn’t bad enough rural counties turning doses now-ish. really. EU deal included options individual countries purchase additional mRNA vaccines, everyone exercised option.

Had AZ realistic estimates, least countries would performed better. lack oxygen becomes death sentence cases would otherwise survive oxygen support. reason I’m making obvious point many times people need oxygen support get couple days recover. saw least colleges requiring vaccines attend still going require distancing, masks, etc. Which...lol. That's true entire time, availability rural areas urban sites run almost immediately. employer covers everything I'd rather free healthcare finish month later vaccinating crazy expensive healthcare. that, UK shown possible. 4/20 l, maybe things little relaxed today read little bit vaccine situation Japan look like supply issue **approval** issue. government dragging feet ready give wide-spread approval. trying understand better. 74 people died fully vaccinated 6000 infections 84M people? That’s like 1.23 death rate Isnt covid death rate around same? Someone educate me? So, someone decides scientifically valid medical treatment dramatically reduce need future medical treatment equivalent someone merely exists high risk community? Nursing home thing?  Yeah people pissed still it. 

How add anything here? today, next level kids 12 up. 
Hopefully real soon. absolutely second start happening state. sure yet I'll there!

I could see even buying tickets acts I'm lukewarm even know I'm desperate see live music again.  there’s actual official threshold right? Americans olympic champions projection. He's lost credibility portion public needs convinced get vaccine. That's audience someone position targeting. Instead he's boasted he's lied changed things attempt manipulate behavior. needs pulled limelight someone better, concrete messaging needs put place. even 1/10th amount vaccine country 1/10th population? would 1/100th vaccine per capita. I’m 19 wait 2 days calling get it. far know they’ve letting anyone wants get since March. reached herd immunity form

And know we've reached that? Uhhhh. 

Immunizing herd immunity isn’t new thing all.  Also we’re fucking dark ages probably act like it. don’t think anyone knows shouldn’t worry fully vaccinated read it, mentioned specific targets, Fauci unwilling give, crux this. brought Germany it. Upon reflection, realized honestly give fuck Trump credit gets get. He's totally irrelevant point. lost. president. He's anchor dragging GOP. Whatever feelings are, afford therapist. messaging could used.

doesn't palpable. resonate. PCR tests - gold standard testing - disposable breathalyser's sensitivity rate far 95 per cent, specificity, 99 per cent.

what would mean? detects 95% positive cases? 1% chance detecting false-positive?

if, if, understanding correct, I'm sure effective tool curtailing inflow potentially infected passengers. virus go communities fairly quickly, likely many communities already gotten begin point. gonna need see source without "".ru"" end, chief. Yeah, didn’t really even think till someone else commented here. read seemed speculative, conclusive evidence indicate actually reduce efficacy. 

I’m personally gonna worry it. One it’s already done (and sounds like we’ll getting boosters anyway). two figure get sick real take medication, immune system still figures fight sickness. top ranked colleges don’t nursing programs huge waste money go nursing degree.

Most top schools pay way come close paying way, still, top students would rather become doctors nurses, yeah.

So nursing school would expensive run get lot interest students qualified attend Yale.

Basically, good enough get Yale (except legacy), going get med school.

I guess fact nursing schools top universities (*maybe* couple exceptions can't name top head) means there's less emphasis academic pedigree professions, though, nursing, judged whether license whether experience hospital. bachelor's degree, RN license, hospital experience, get above-average salary anywhere. Oh no, I’ve actually literally copying pasting CDC guidelines you’re getting upset don’t actually understand vaccines work. may say do, may think do, literally idea vaccine works think there’s statistically probable, let alone significant chance, vaccinated person die covid. numbers don’t care personally feel. Get it.  There's one way hit herd immunity, way done since dawn time. Stop acting vaccine way. Yeah makes sense lol. lot convinced there’s grander nefarious conspiracy keep everyone wearing masks forever... anyone would benefit outside mask-producing companies. Yale actually School Nursing. Thanks, meant supporters 45, sub stupid filters want risk putting word entire comment erased. Obvo mean them, main rationale seemingly vast majority vaccine hesistant. Yeah, remember Kamala Harris said take Trump's vaccine? fuckin' GOP! Research Draco. could cure even common cold. cant get funding. Hopefully help keep case mild. think whole conversation comes across manipulative condescending.

We don’t want messaged at. want receive accurate information left alone process it. Maybe would help information come black doctors, intervention end there. Tuskegee nowhere near relevant non-black people think (but irrelevant either). point close Romania. 

We vaccinated fully (i.e. 2 doses) ~10% population another ~7% 1st dose. Today first time free spots anyone schedule shot tomorrow (or +1..2 days tops) vaccine choice Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca. 

In ~2 weeks likely able walk unscheduled vaccination center get shot. 

So 25-30% population actively seek get vaccinated ASAP. rest uphill battle. We'll probably vaccinate ~60% September easy.  reading another sub Pfizer's trial tested 95% efficacy one week second dose. two weeks second CDC abundance caution. almost certainly fine. I'm sorry dad it. anyone information/resources discuss long covid live within fully vaccinated person?

One friends fully vaccinated days. younger sibling (too young get vaccine) immunocompromised cannot risk getting covid. worried catching covid still transmitting sibling. plan wearing masks keeping distance home, still worried. known yet long vaccinated person carrier? worried seeing people going public? still get covid even vaccinated masks social distancing still needed. memorial day treated differently last year. small county next already announced 39 people fully vaccinated contracted it. kind guesstimate it'd herd immunity guesstimated around 70% shame severely downvoted pretty funny. /s resign. like Donald Trump did. ...oh wait. No, certainly agree divisive. Rather making cogent point Fauci, badgering guy trying make say Fauci divisive. act alone divisive. Badgering act divisiveness. insinuated wearing mask example others. care kinds others care me. gave 14 months. Yeah make appointment Walmart's website. confirmation email told bring ID never checked got there. mean, much different Cuomo nobody seems care anymore. took decades get people wear seatbelts regularly. math works equal amounts vaccines. lol typical vaccine effective enough anyone takes protected even every single person come contact infected. frame getting vaccine selfish inaccurate best, manipulative worst. aside, lecturing people already worlds apart abt they're selfish get vaccine indefensibly idiotic. benefit Moderna pfizer worried error. Pfizer also overdiluted. come pre-diluted would much better. would. Make sure seek treatment get covid waste resources you. surprise lined way. trials big enough get good tally vaccinated deaths. 

I could see almost mirror image regular COVID 95% less cases, deaths large majority old comorbidities. 

Of course 95% less transmission effectively kills thing, long people get shots good. message good intent said always good. I'm remembering story correctly, wealthy women bought hyped prolonging youth/delaying menopause therapy using hormones women mostly ended cancer. read rest post. misinformed. Yeah I’ve seen reports it’s possibly 3-5x official number cases. First Amendment law general perfectly fine people inventing religion, adding pieces onto religion. say religion requires eat pork every day, matter hundred pastors say otherwise; court accept word personal religion.  dunno you, say wearing mask making suffer. fogs sunglasses wearing somewhat inconvenient, suppose.

Continuing wear mask practice social distancing post-vaccination recommended CDC public health officials, also mentioned good idea posted It’s true experts believe vaccinated people still sometimes wear mask, partly it’s modest inconvenience reduces tiny risk — mostly contributes culture mask wearing. decent thing people still aren’t vaccinated. you’re vaccinated, mask symbol solidarity anything else. 

But you. .ru domain... would matter? There's many free riders would say ""welp, need vaccine everything's opening anyway!"" message. Hang 1 day! CDC says cases 4.6x higher reported. would put CFR little .4  would total let nurse know say closing eyes it’s lol wouldn’t bet farm oh lord let me! glad feeling good shape, best luck you! fine. 1st dose like 80% two weeks anyway even higher that. UK prime example that. at-risk person really need worry sarcasm horribly executed second part makes sense Cries Canadian. State universities control state government; state put sorts requirements want. Oh, I'm aware good vaccine is. then, try telling MIL lol. Facts information run person like water greased balloon.

I think better reasons continue practicing caution are:

* Emerging variants (eventually, one emerge vaccine-resistant)
* Infections children (no vaccine presently available them
* benefit unvaccinated people Fauci said 70% US population must vaccinated achieve herd immunity, least one million people vaccinated every day since January 20, 2021, reach September 7. However, we’re vaccinating three million people per day, I’ve rounded September 1. Yeah, getting second dose month early locally we've done good job getting jabs arms. Proveryay, doveryay! puts vaccine every neighborhood, much onus people search sign up. variant 6,000 get? mutations stand out? Im little annoyed area/state booked appointments months advance. booking appointments end May end March.

Now area bunch appointments open week fear people appointments middle May something dont realize think ""oh got appointment May!"" stop worrying getting shot.

So ... There's suppose. I've got endometriosis adds random nausea days nausea caused shot got ignored. Comorbid anemia that's managed two 65mg iron tablets day. sertraline buspirone, interactions vaccine. Mid thirties. highest temp 100.6 next day, arm got swollen (the muscle itself) could move halfway literally locked up. Hurt bad tetanus shot, even rubbing it. next day felt like million bucks. Like guy work says won’t get long term effects yet still chews tobacco know long term effects 2020 Olympics postponed pandemic. gotta point logical flaw there--that's talking *has* happened. Fauci talking *should* happen. ""Is"" rarely ""ought"". seem like pleasant person. likely, way see issue state like Alabama low vaccination rate another summer surge. Still, time unvaccinated personal choice. America politicizes everything What's stupid trial data countries Russia involving Sputnik seem suggest vaccine bad option certainly taken option. course Russia claim sort damn miracle cure instead proud able one country's domestically create effective vaccine. I’m pretty bad needles, looked like ones using pretty big, honestly bit shocked didn’t even feel going in, felt like someone pressed shoulder thumb Russian press release talks symptomatic COVID too. I've lonely since shit. I'm ready go back gym, bars, see strangers without worrying going kill family Nobody even New Visa enter old Visa Holders can. Makes zero sense. get visa Jan 2020 May enter country managed get visa date. enter country. Plenty Student, workers, unmarried couples desperately trying get anything Japan care. Thanks, Joe. uses ad5 first shot ad26 second. So, like J&amp;J AZ.  AZ using chimpanzee Ad Yeah don’t remember “stay home two weeks flatten curve” stage pandemic last March/April? Like wear masks? niave comments like make seriously doubt capabilities position. sad thing I’m sure it’s different US many people....out sight, mind. People continuing shirk even basic precautions since it’s affecting enough care.

If anything India got lucky happened there’s least vaccine available least partially alleviate situation. Would’ve horrendous surge happened early pandemic like many feared want 100% vaccinated reopen normal? sure point there. couple weeks, might hit bump road vaccinations may need change messaging. Science needs taught way schools....it single handedly important field surrounds every day life explain everything. pushes us forward unknown, pertains health technology teaches us think critically logical way avoid misconceptions bias's assess actually true want believe true. think that's good way thinking it. course, *was* danger U.S. last March.

And basically happened Italy last spring.

Not gonna happen vaccines working, though. Science works!

India needs vaccines ASAP prevent humanitarian disaster. vaccine card would hard fake, someone trying forge one avoid authorities, lot numbers would make deliveries trackable. two lots go pharmacist? so, call pharmacy ask certain patient.

Not sure ever matter, certainly harm you, may let fraudsters make fake cards easier prove it? close reaching herd immunity Children can't get still need protect still. friend lied said caretaker 😬 wanted get since there’s long delay first second jabs UK. recognizing relative risk dumb. 

It's TRUE could still catch spread covid. also true risk least 90% (and probably 95%+) reduced. 

Don't let perfect enemy good. Giggity  Cherish pic. reminder end horrid 2 years Got second Pfizer dose today!! Can't wait May 3rd (which I'll fully vaccinated)! 

Btw, May 3rd, I'll still wear mask stores require it, do, still need double mask, wear N95 mask? Orrrrrrr wear regular cloth mask used wear recommended double mask/use N95 masks couple months back? telling me... went bike ride near Brandenburg Gate months ago greeted huge anti-mask protests people holding large TRUMP flags wearing Q clothes. thought escaped it, stupid everywhere. Hmmm good know. I’ll look that. South Africa trip planned late October. data 74 died? mostly 80+ year olds co-morbidities diverse set people? People react differently vaccines general. specific COVID vaccine.  No, that's reality he's openly bragged lying masks herd immunity. found lied people manipulate behavior surefire way get people stop listening Fauci *bragged* it. can't portray scientist people listen lie science. summer I’m sure things look different vaccines start flowing Go outside things before. really helped ease irrational fear. Also keep mind newspapers always exaggerate level doom. example predicting massive fourth wave, never happened I’m “fully vaccinated” trust are? admit it, don’t care life people. participated clinical trials, but, someone rare medical issue, definitely interested applied several hopes getting help issues helping others same. never worked out. Also, covid far serious public health issue lifetime, even willing before, I'd definitely willing now. can't much else help. stay home much can, wear masks, etc, also, since I've still working, try spend money community help keep economy going. could get involved trials medications, yes, absolutely, would least look it. serious enough issue warrant deeper involvement.

I respect that. Personally would hard time I'm healthy want risk personally. clinical trials. Trials completed. 3 vaccines given eua US went three normal stages clinical trials usual. Things sped reducing time trials moving vaccines front line results arrived fda. understanding (as layperson) eua cut bureaucratic process red tape, testing. vaccines currently normal process approval, likely formally approved within weeks.

Of course can't find anything seen videos people shown get vaccine paperwork sign says right clinical trial. Admittedly could faked anyone word processor desire get 15 minutes Fame. 

Thank taking time talk it. many people sides aisle fast jump anyone's throat agree things. clinical trials, everybody died covid received placebo.  WHO's recent CFR 2.2%, that's still pretty decent improvement. would also make sense vaccinated people getting tested much lower rate, especially infected people vaccinated showing symptoms much lower rate.

I'm fully vaccinated would feel completely comfortable going bar right based data. Risk zero -- welcome life -- well within standard risk tolerance stuff (driving car, getting flu, etc.) even vaccines going last 2-5 years most. Needs studying refine. Also, study mutations occur. There's Krispy Kremes area, brought vax card went Birmingham Indycar season opener past weekend, there's Krispy Kreme near staying.

[I think anti-vaxxers conspiring keep free almost 3x much vaccines, thus got doses fastest.

[Jan Israel secured 1 million doses, Canada 100k

Feb 1st: Israel 5 million doses, Canada million doses

When 900k vaccines first month country size Vancouver island thats vaccinate faster. already say skip mask social distance meet vaccinated people? could swear read that. Germany - 72 diabetes? Sorry, dumb buying doses advance we're wrapping everything paperwork like fucking christmas present.

That person mother, me, infuriates me. Maybe one anecdotes people's lingering symptoms disappeared vaccinations.

&lt;3 assure upgrades microchip second dose insane sure long you’ve following sub, I’ve keeping tabs since early January (actually point sub meme sub China_Flu popular one).... watching train wreck unfold China, seeing doctors every person decked full respiratory PPE.

 utter shock subs public health bigwigs started telling people flat wear mask. mad bad bungled around. 

Everything wishy washy response could actually made difference. Even China went full lockdown still flights going country. entire country China shutting wasn’t big deal. 

Then cases coming in....and weren’t even enforcing quarantines people high risk areas. Like #1 basic thing used fight plagues last 1500ish years 

Made lose pretty much respect public health system overnight. could’ve imagined leadership inept? Hydrate, Tylenol. That’s plan shot 2 tomorrow. Worked great round 1. took stores keep stock selling quickly, stores lowering price tests offered free testing centers. pop-up testing centers Berlin. choice 5 6 vicinity. 

If they're used Australia I'm guessing country's regulation process. Here's list quick antigen tests submitted approval Germany: 125 approved tests point, vast majority coming China. kind gather information test even understand German. asian countries extremely densely populated much issue pandemic. Pakistan deaths Asia ~16000 deaths 224,000,000 population.

Calling nations getting shit together help next pandemic hopefully act end situation lives. Walgreens rapid test (ID NOW) qualify travel. available everywhere though. average working age person probably lose life commuting expected life got Covid mean like said covid would gone easter? LAST Easter? That's assumption based opinion messaging. Picture? Texas one there. gave shot kicked right after. y’all talking celebrations haha see definition ""effectiveness"" article; *incredibly* important look way terms defined reading claims. wanted really disingenuous, could define ""effective"" ""prevents severe disease"" get really high number.

If 97.6% effective mild covid, however, would fantastic.  Thanks uplifting message. Pretty much everyone turning telling vaccine pointless due young age. really don’t ever want re-live time got covid November. still haven’t olfactory receptors go back normal. Everything still smells/tastes like gas flowers. Low key best comment I’ve read tonight I’m literally using direct quotes saying can’t do. I’m also referring normal gatherings people. 

Your chances hospitalized vaccinated literally 0.0005%. Go flip coin get back lands heads 17 times row, get worried happens. 

But now, stop trying shame people living lives. People tired, they’re following CDC guidelines. risk person eligible get vaccinated months point it’s responsibility look health.  First like already said, I’m area situation don’t worry infecting others. 

Secondly, I’m gonna care think gonna tell put body. don’t know what’s hear positive things it’s risk personal level maybe I’ll take trip place get one. 

People entitled opinions. I’m gonna possibly harm believe know 100% vaccine won’t affect negatively (I,E pretty much saying know I’m allergic won’t badly affect medical condition underlying condition may may could even possibly kill me). 

This vaccine hurting people affecting negatively. Johnson Johnson vaccine production hold major negative side effects people having. 

Word advice: shouldn’t derogatory attitude. Besides medical reasons could someone’s religion take vaccines. It’s mine could offend someone comment. kind misleading, definitely 100% trials, 100% outside trials. skeptical people see ""100%"" efficacy preventing deaths, see thats true, help feeds mentality That’s interesting. First shot tired. Second one got headache next day could also work....  Doesn’t mean we’ll actually get though. experts much even-keeled reasonable throughout pandemic. Osterholm great fodder anyone trying write negatively leaning article Covid never going end, we're fucked, etc, etc. look forward never hear Oh coffee!! soda! sushi! lunch meats! runny eggs, salads, allergy medicines, soft cheeses, and...🙄 letting pandemic run completely unopposed population threatening brazillians, minority rights are? Wow, never understand religious conservatives. Get kids next up. I've heard 70% floating around. also Israel look real world data. Tell get make decisions worth tons people happy getting vaccinated.  Ok, quick question. get even undocumented? well look bright side... consistent numbers people getting vaccinated next couple month. need get front page Reddit! transmitting? can't believe Japan ended dropping ball this. know American (the majority, me) fucked lost lot people, blows mind Japan went someone look to, huge surges cases 2021. good thing Japan situation death rate (%) low ever since mid 2020.

I considering booking cheap Covid flight far advance visit Japan, even know Japan 2022. hope so. Correct.

Last year, said CCP bunch liars (""millions deaths"" bit far though) year say exactly thing.

ofc, people say China deaths early 2020 *then* got virus control, that's different argument entirely anyone care lying maskless people could get vaccinated worry getting sick 20 minutes?!? take 1-3 days! Well free ones do. USA I’m sure isn’t surprising. do, I've hopes crushed many times pandemic. really shaken me. One thing sure, won’t time like should. it’s first time charged crime, they’ll get probation years. whether people like not, they’re race come play ultimate determining factor harshness sentencing. So, jail time maybe couple years probation.  Looking peer reviewed stamp. Also, bit strange “considerable” period time study took place disclosed Reuters article curious know parameters this. You’re one trying cherry pick data. CDC says it’s safer around people. hundreds people. Yeah, that's partially vaccinated. talking FULLY vaccinated. love taking sick time. im well coming in.

My coworkers never take sick time workaholics get butthurt that. anyone know state's official page numbers much less? Yup.. Kamala really tanked uptake comments VP debate. Nova Scotia hosting Internationals (IIHF womens) starting next months yet cancelled. 10 international teams already isolating Halifax preparing it. would move. likely vaccinated people cant spread covid CDC Centers Disease Control walking back claims made director people vaccinated COVID-19 spread virus, clarifying yet definitively know that's Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky said Tuesday ""vaccinated people carry virus, get sick, clinical trials also real world data."" It’s like matter many times see repeated, it’s ignored. agree. We're reaching tipping point. New variants always risk (and SAR-COV-2 came from), go back normal rate infections goes reasonable assume stay normal conditions. Today \~85% societal protection, either vaccine natural infection, multiplied efficacy rates. Right probability variant escaping natural vaccinated immunity high rate new infections still high time rate natural vaccinated immunity moderately high (\~50% state). people behave well (get vaccine, mask, socially distance themselves) ease restrictions 85% rate spread low mutation rate also low (which function total amount virus community). rate new infections high, need closer 85%. Brazilian SA variants get established US, number going higher vaccines less effective.

The CDC concerned making definitive statement, even true today, true tomorrow difficult walk back. Probably, I'd like see venue requirements like. really want shell fully masked venue October. back normal? Hell yeah. Thank goodness Biden/ Harris. South African study hardly confirmed anything. poorly written article One thing note though vaccination rates different different US regions. could see cases fall areas continue rise others. I'll take one modifies DNA become Spider-Man, personally None. Look dengue vaccine sold Philippines Sanofi, properly tested company knew could cause children actually worse reactions disease sold anyway.

There fine line skeptical vaccine approved emergency use going normal rigorous standards testing, knowing vaccines manufactured poorly past, anti-vaxxer. 

People stupid, *brilliance* people pride one ounce scientific nuance really counter argument anyway. Liability waiver.

If willing stand product take it. I’m glad put TLDR sentence hard follow Doubt math real. Pure speculation, I'm willing nuts true number people infected way way higher reported. US get free vaccination vaccination site. papers checked  sure beats simultaneously denying virus exists, blaming China, prescribing whatever quack remedy Sudafed-addled brain dream up, taking credit great job, calling Democrat hoax, golfing. shits days after. fever, chills, etc advil, tylenol fine.. fever 101 30 hours after, woulda tough without ""Only."" sound like right word use much so. need tegridy life. group says they're waiting long term studies side effects, they're split people actually mean that, people trying sow doubt. keep moving goalposts. I've already heard people saying vaccine kill 50% take 5 years. That's essentially impossible disprove meaningful way. complete bs, shocking number people convinced get vaccine crap like that. Well shit, asked domain end .ru lmao I'm sure Desantis ""fudging"" numbers (which completely blown proportion) anything original quote brought up. undergrad thing note numbers many breakthrough infections resulting hospitalizations deaths overweight / obese people?

Seeing seems one biggest factors hospitalization, statistic include detail. That's re-cast Russian source.  “We’re still learning vaccines affect spread COVID-19. you’ve fully vaccinated COVID-19, keep taking precautions—like wearing mask, staying 6 feet apart others, avoiding crowds poorly ventilated spaces—in public places know more.”

Literally paragraph 2 source. Makes sense put Ram. without approval people 16, don’t see scenario US doesn’t hit 50% general population getting vaxxed. 

Honestly, we'd probably hit 50% people who've signed appointment get shot. still really, really hard get appointment major city (at least Northeast, Midwest West) - nearly every pharmacy grocery chain country giving vaccines booked weeks advance.

And that's even considering students (both college younger) going get vaccine return school. one ever said younger adults kids can’t get “cases” cases don’t automatically mean death Feels like fear mongering. Yeah, younger study know trying two different doses youth see one best. adult doses iirc. already enough concern low risk blood clots AZ vaccine. 

If opened anyone without checking manufacturing chains could actually produce quality product damage bad batch vaccination program would catastrophic. Putin faking since Sochi Winter Olympics, he's master mob tactics. people commonly describe asymptomatic Covid paper uses term. paper labeled people symptoms within day 0-10 positive PCR test asymptomatic found large number individuals manifesting symptoms later. Asymptomatic cases onset lead long haul symptoms study. Going back original question, definitely possible someone test positive Covid, experience symptoms early on, serious symptoms months later, fact vaccines strong effect preventing serious disease onset necessarily mean prevent serious symptoms future. needs studied. got prick 1 today! 100% agree. absolutely. able get health officials confirmed fewer 6,000 cases Covid-19 fully vaccinated Americans, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said. represents 0.007% 84 million Americans full protection virus. know, would hope be.

It'd stupid withhold vaccines people U.S. citizens, it'd bad universities suddenly effectively ban huge chunk students (bad revenue streams schools bad research they'd miss - international grad students ton STEM research).

So guess, I'd assume there'd way set help get vaccines, one way another.

It happens vaccines, all. trying detract people mentioning much harm desantis caused little bit whataboutism?

Really feels like you’re blowing smoke cover. put smog ;) no, 12 Solidarity?

 think taking masks would persuade people get vaccine. go again. Sorry, cities. Let's take biggest one example, Halifax NS. Total population health zone 424,000 people. Covid far = 1380 cases, 67 deaths. comparable part Ontario Windsor, Windsor - Essex Co health zone, population 390,000 people. Covid = 14,844 cases, 409 deaths. absolutely stark difference. Biggest difference two areas government response. Data friend, let be, enlighten world.  Coming non-mask wearing state near you. many states going learn this? Answer: none. never said speaks states, said could offer guidance, orders. sure disturbing. (I’m vaccinated Pfizer way politically neutral, vote) know else disturbing? man influential Dr Fauci would say early pandemic masks weren’t necessary everyone. shutting international travel would help contain clearly dangerous epidemic another continent. put aside facts knew scientist play politics. That’s disturbing. realize hospitalization numbers cumulative, right? kind like bank balance. That's number people beds right number new high. Case numbers, yeah whatever.... metric paying attention hospitalizations. less data still lived totally agree Also convenient Pfizer's PR firm good enough keep getting paused eh? fact clinical studies vaccine 95% effective mean 5% risk getting sick. actual risk real world much lower herd immunity effect. researchers start looking data samples hundreds thousands initial studies show real risks extremely low. 0.00x%. kind low rates stop seriously limit evolution new strains viruses host pool large enough mutate randomly ""success"" developing strain spread. Shot 2 Friday - I'm ready memorial day parties end May!!! Damned trolley problem. could get Fauci throw number two. No, thing. talk blood clots low platelets. got first one Philly convention center last week. Walk-in, appointment, line. Giant place, many people going it’s running smoothly quickly. impressed. UPenn, people don’t go IVy league nurse. Many friends say get vaccine like virus negatively affects black people more. US citizen get vaccinated? know international med students California vaccinated already. I'm fully vacinated, still practicing social distancing, still wearing mask public, still practicing mitigation. can't understand fellow Americans get vaccinated practice mitigation. people selfish. behavior United States number COVID-19 deaths, possibility pandemic lingering longer. What's wrong people? mean, it’s bit complicated that. ER calls definitely instigated change, there’s whole lot it. works hospital, private practice, hospital limits amount Medicare patients accept. Stuff like changed worldview sure.

But also knows isn’t simple fix thing. knows economic, socioeconomic, cultural, etc. factors every situation isn’t quick easy fix everything. also knows reasonable unreasonable things done. might actually agree opinions ideas. He’s always listen points views admits could wrong lot things. Also lot people, like parents fully vaccinated moderna since March, look excuse leave house. Covid incredibly convenient them. they’d cancelled trip raining two states over. That's awesome Waiting weeks get one want 100X dangerous less effective AZ. least Michigan, case numbers roof. 

If somewhere COVID-19 relatively contained *and* keep quarantined everyone else getting together 6 weeks, sure, wait vaccine choice. I've already double dosed, get concerns people have. fast tracked vaccines, dose 2 pfizer sucks, 2 biggest ones (J&amp;J Astro) shelved countries using them. help public confidence. know example external molecule making way cell, causing cell make protein? 

That's exactly viruses do. US students

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* believe something around 70% thrown around year now.  fantasy land if’s. 

The point we’re living 200 years ago maybe act like it. required values calculate percentage required vaccinated R0 sars-cov-2 keeps changing due mutations. change future new variants evolve, especially small fraction global population even access vaccines.  think understand coming entirely disagree you, think true idiocy resides world live necessary come stratagems aimed appealing self-interest get vaccine global pandemic order end it. I’d estimate would approval. I’m also random internet person. “Out 6,000 breakthrough infections, 396 people hospitalized 74 people died, according CDC data released last week.” 74/6000 = 1.2% CFR got shot told take pain medicine 🤷‍♀️ Ireland even smaller, nowhere near vaccination rate Israel. Switzerland, Belgium, Netherlands, etc either. 

They bought block 450 million people. block would never able Israel did, even exactly Israel did. matter countries small, ones bought Size population alone account success. 

I know. That's started ""add that"". Jeez, hopeful India managed dodge worst it. read article, someone deals products counterfeited en mass Chinese companies, IP real, big deal. get hard left boner Gates, thinks everything free, protecting IP tech trade secrets important. Would guys buy vaccine Wish? absolutely cannot give away R &amp; products. nationalism vaccine distribution? sure, especially politician prioritizing countries people, would bounced ass. OP sounds like another limosine leftist thinks hierarchy world outside bubble influence. We've known year outdoor transmission nearly zero. I've always assumed outdoor mask orders supposed make indoor mask wearing common. could easily opposite effect encouraging people things indoors instead out. measure, also days. hours. We're literally waiting extra seconds. also months.

And sucks can't go bar coffee shop. sucks can't visit friends, niece growing without (time flies kids) there's members family miss seeing person. continue sit home. sucks much friends live high risk areas work high risk jobs need wait even days more. 

The age based eligibility makes sense starting point, appointments going unfilled, need open eligibility groups. can't give 55+ exclusive priority booking access forever they're taking offer I'm glad vaccine, imagine second actually possible create one stable. exactly would happened? We'd hiding rest lives? [Reuters Ok, well, sure.. 17 year olds, plenty folks 20's, 30's , 40's 50's. disease old people.  parents ones telling girls can't wear distracting boys. Never said new, course isn't. Somehow people want act started herd immunity ""0%"" day 1 vaccine start. That's anywhere near truth. I’m sure changes much.

Even old full immunisation targets October (pre AZ bad news), signalling wouldn’t enough reopen then, might looking early 2022.

Simply vaccine 100% effective also needed wait overseas case loads dropped significantly.  Even vaccine passports we’d importing many “breakthrough” cases.

So herd immunity delayed months, doesn’t mean opening also delayed months.  never happening year. people buying vaccine cards eBay. free doughnuts!

/s US 41,000 cases day April 18th, lowest it’s since case numbers blew last year late October. 5 month old son got covid 3 weeks ago. single dose pfizer kept negative. relief getting final negative test last week. bro Anyone still takes CNN seriously recent expose needs reality check. lot people consider pressing matter even they'd happy get vaccine.

Yep. brother like this. brother already gotten first dose past week. talking brother like ""Oh yeah, need remember get scheduled."" like talking getting oil changed. walk anywhere without appointment get shot, lot people it. IDK man. live conservative county California full a-hole anti-maskers antivaxxers. I'd rather keep masks around longer higher vaccination rate. slight inconvenience wear might protect vulnerable little longer jerks. officially fully vaccinated yesterday (it's 2 weeks since 2nd Pfizer shot) :D reduces symptoms could possibly estimate this? I’m sure going full FL yet given fact counties keep dropping lower tiers cases staying flat record low positivity rates, certain due vaccines. first time read June 15th thought political stunt seems like reality maybe slow counties! summer going great. What? people got happy brag outright lied 🤦🏻‍♂️ think we're slow-walked permanent masks, least masks 2022 ""out abundance caution."" past four weeks, 2.4x daily. “Calm down” facts? said covid would go away April 2020, right? hypothetical person?

Someone want wear mask wants go bars every weekend since last summer. 


The person talking about, begrudgingly wears mask go public...that's person sway letting drop mask go public. someone super wearing mask also vaccine, need free license wear mask...they alrady aren't. framing conflict individual collective goals simply not. individual vaccinated AZ much lower risk individual vaccinated anything. Time critical, they're also much lower risk individual unvaccinated receive mRNA vaccination several weeks months. least one case someone turned AstraZeneca died covid. Anyone defers chance get vaccinated raising likelihood contracting transmitting virus. whole point. everyone 100% certainty could go weeks without getting virus, need vaccines.

The collective goals still crucial though, even individual level. everyone's self-interest live community herd immunity. _only_ way ends. Delays getting mean people die. people care that, delays vaccination rollout also mean extended restrictions _shit can't go back normal ICUs past maximum capacity_. People concerned ultra-rare side effects vaccination also consider things could kill medical system broken. specific value percentage population needs vaccinated known yet. got moderna vaccine Walmart. surprised see doses lot number. Anyone else too? enough vaccine. govt buy !! Heartbreaking Yeah!!! Congrats bottom heart! Truly ""full circle"" &amp; I'm excited guys &amp; adventures are, doubt, ahead you!

Honestly..this way. playbook T. Talk change life post-shot. planned. things comfortable with. contagious. People want too, messaging great US. need ""here's *can* post-vaccine"" message. 

But...WE difference friends/family/co-workers

I hope guys plan something fabulous &amp; enjoy hell it! covid shit still works even legal? That’s case everything say support it? vaccinated mean can't make antibodies? I'm pretty sure still get, spread, symptoms covid exposed even vaccine? I'm sure point That’s good point. I’d say situation Ecuador sounds like it’s caused poor immigration policy part (not taxing immigrants, letting senior citizens immigrate retirement without contributing anything). matter fault lies, situation is.

How think they’d react US donated surplus vaccines countries (as they’re already considering doing) stipulation amount reserved prioritized US citizens? Like, here’s enough vaccinate healthcare workers highest risk citizens, also here’s enough US citizens living country. don’t go giving vaccine lower risk people offering US citizens. Like, US citizens get priority group average joe, vital cases.

My main issue US taxes Americans abroad, starts giving away vaccines without even considering millions Americans. Like, fine, that, don’t make pay taxes. don’t go proudly talking Americans eligible vaccine stuff millions absolutely 0 access hope getting access time soon. That’s blatantly false, insulting say that, they’re implying Americans abroad aren’t real Americans, aren’t citizens. Instead, fucking say “all US residents access”. Hell, it’s accurate, they’re letting immigrants US get vaccinated, too.

I guess could sum position Taxes = provide taxpayers donating “surplus”, taxes = let country residence handle it. Or.... “no taxation without vaccination” ... heheh 🙃 hospitalizations changed all? California blew whole rollout. Newsome done He’s pretty consistent. thing don’t like seems allergic giving people light end tunnel. BBC link work. 

And second link says Afvifafir used fifteen countries.

(FWIW, heard it)  plus new variants since trials. Canadian thing I've read while. 

""Here life-saving vaccine.""

""No, turn nose this. finest mRNA shall enter Northern veins."" felt 0 either shot. gamble tragic ☹️ agree. believe happen next weekend, first weekend May. able walk anywhere get one day, perhaps wait.

Also within time, start sending J&amp;J community. clinics. It'll corner stores gas stations. It'll vaccine equal ice cream trucks. gonna get crazy real quick terms issue demand supply. then, mid June, care anymore everyone older 11 wants one it. According article, every country misreported deaths, Russia FAR worst.

I'm defending them. Far actually, think Putin megalomaniac threat world safety. they're unique underplaying number deaths. Yes, data preliminary point, variants might impact that. Better continue stop spread adhering CDC guidelines. likely move little slower we’d like, things right track. lol wondered ""Why wearing masks outside?"" articles media make money business advertiser interests coming Good! one dose likely helpful helping fight off. Even dose lot prevent serious symptoms. never denied existence... need revisit speech listen said. fumbled COVID response doubt there’s plenty criticize for, never called virus hoax. covid nurse since shit started. family refusing get vaccine. I'm scared them, can't imagine life without them. feel disrespected. shit is. Get vaccine prevent illness. That's needs said. post says cases reported mRNA vaccines. getting lot Mexican tourists coming way get vaccines. Mostly high-middle class, eligible many months.
Vaccination scarce highly political manipulate outcome June elections.
Meanwhile people resources think twice traveling north grab vaccine.
The way see it, situation unfair everyone understand you’re coming from, trials started last summer, hundreds millions people gotten vaccinated since December, 5 months ago. far haven’t heard long term effects trials nearly year ago now. 

If mean long term showing two years you’ve gotten vaccine, mean... getting sick two years later could anything. I'm sure US nothing though. never interfere fortieth elections, especially S. America. /s Thanks. I’m sure opposite happen. “Why would need risk getting emergency vaccine it’s going away?” Heard friend say something similar week. Operation Warp Speed Trump helped vaccine development roll significantly. Trump fumbled COVID response overall, gotta give credit it’s due 95% efficacy means vacinating benifiting anyone else though, get vacinated, benifits them, regardless im vacinated get it. I've got 2 year old relatives want come visit. Even though they're vaccinated, give 15 minute rapid test worry exposing chance carrying it. worth $20 peace mind.

I'm sure pretty small % people get it, doctor alone treating several &amp; I've read several case studies parts country well.

I'm curious. projections number can't verify (number cases instead positive tests), know he's accurate? ""strictures” Well friend ought let go. 

If don’t want job boss said, he’s basically paid rebel. Good. cant tell many dumbass college kids see online wont get vaccinated go partying without masks. It’s opinion piece. high level evidence forgot donate DeSantis get jail free card. Fauci CDC still waiting completely impossible saying point safe say vaccine effective 99.9999% sure cant transmit virus based Israel data shouldn’t to.

Wonder what's going on. Flat wrong? No. dozens articles quoting experts last March saying necessary. OK yeah whatever right, let's ignore people saying internet look facts. 

The US sitting 30 million AstraZeneca doses they've basically admitted never use, slowly expiring. shared? (Yes know loaned 4 million neighbors, rest). they're even allowing AZ export outside US. 

This proving point ""told so"" moments. pandemic rages globally, America safe. Every hotspot petri dish new variants one day one going actually evolve evade current vaccines. Thank you. helpful kind you! probably part one Yes, heard used two separate vectors, explains higher efficacy. Increased anti-body creation (not sure that's right way describing it!). Source? Take vitamin C D, drink lots water, fine! know started? inactive while, really notice gradual change. mods found fishy behavioir, probably here. probably effective trust issue huge hurdle overcome. russians notoriously trust government vaccine uptake pretty bad there. probably didnt help putin got vaccinated didnt say vaccine got Almost 50% US adults *received least one dose.* 25% population fully vaccinated. Oh yes. Mr inject disinfectant shine sunlight body real “winner”. seem think know better medical professionals whose job literally is? Right, you’re fully vaccinated one shot J&amp;J regardless prior MRNA vaccine administration, I’m sure would explain discrepancy. people eligible vaccine 65 plus right now, ones turning down. point shutting things past year+ masking enough keep giving senior citizen grocery store.

That’s got. turning Free-For-All. could say thing almost disease.

You use numbers argument mean anything. wife nice - I'll never understand it. refuse watch masked singer. disgusting. Heavily restricting J&amp;J usage EU mean reopening potentially delayed 1-2 months. tiny quantity AZ easily replaced mRNA-vaccines, cannot said J&amp;J. Deliveries Q2 significant 55M doses expected. 

Some countries restricted AZ 60+ possible J&amp;J many EU countries largely vaccinated least invited 60+ groups. (For example parts Norway already vaccinating 45+ due unexpected extra deliveries Pfizer) Happy 420 everybody, please safe there, take care loved ones. goal US government control global pandemic serve citizen.

I'm EU citizen blame EU 100% investing lots money early. cheap pre order $30 pfizer. Ordering one dose manufacturer would less $200 pay taxes half week.

 There's need sentimental assholes takers. world better without them. That's objective truth. Oh no...

Anyway! post crap want, change fact Florida dealt virus better state considering high risk population.

You see CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, NBC, NPR. actually predicted demand almost spot on. hit 1.9 million 7 day average days, falling pretty dramatically since. wrote song called Jailbait. Hell even stranglehold pretty fucked up, murder way rape. 

He really gross Get lost nerd government can’t tell big ho has? Oh dear.

Now, where's TV remote?   tweet got canceled? I'm loop. study ignores amount work every East Asian country put pandemic. People killed stress. Kids separated school. Nurses shaved heads. 

It extreme.  would get tested? whole thing hoax needs drink bleach. I’m telling you, it’s big deal. Everybody dies sooner later.

Schadenfreude Awesome, happened nicer guy What's ""real"" pandemic anyways? death count threshold reach? Fucking moron. Good. guess somewhat normality June 1st (comparable last summer) end restrictions Aug 15th.

The end restrictions depends whether vaccinated people infected South African variant still spread virus significant amounts. Data Israel suggests infection South African variant happens often vaccinated people infection variants, time share people total population infected variant remains constant.

To me, looks like efficacy towards variants high enough stop transmission, data hopefully coming.
In worst case scenario we'll continue wear masks ban large events enough people vaccinated variant-specific booster shot.
But think likely scenario necessary, give booster shots vulnerable people without NPIs.  I'm sick expected take high road comes this. Regressives constantly trying use morals us exhibiting none themselves. hope shit upsets least means we're getting skin finally, they're probably faking it. know *that* many nurses, I've gotten hurt numerous occasions also displeasure knowing personally. rate 4 times lower J&amp;J though thus risk reward profile different. Also, one must consider one dose, perhaps countries would looking AZ taking (extremely small) risk twice per individual, taking third/a quarter risk means around sixth eighth less risky AZ (because many second doses AZ given yet know risks condition second dose ok first, presumably lot lower/non-existent many countries stopped second doses may thinking like this) would pretty awesome 'vid flushed turd.

Ohioans would move Southeast Michigan, reminded often Ohio existed. Muhammad wives ages 13-45, Aisha covid deniers blasé lives millions. Oh, old double switcheroo, nice. think still fair amount people vaccine access issues. people willing drive long distances get vaccine makes things harder people cars. vaccine ubiquitously available flu shot we'll get uptake among want shot, care enough spend money vacation time get it. never wished man dead, sometimes looked forward reading obituary. 

Paraphrased, course. reputable source outside ok United States is, unfortunately, rotting bottom many ways. really dont know why, collective mindset leaving things emergency level 10 updating fixing them. ancient internet lines, many areas undrivable roads, MANY laws fucking outdated unreal.

Does anyone know find dataset covid19 active case counts US states? checked many datasets like JHU, stopped counting active cases.

Most resources given internet nothing websites graphs stats. give data anywhere (eg. Worldometer).

Does anyone lead? point direction find one? Holy shit Lol well done least Covid got someone else deserves whole thing sounded like burnt asscrack whole wheat. 

Let's honest here.... people right like Rap actually going care bad objectively?  Bobby Orr think us age think lyrics embodiment writer's beliefs social commentary satire shock value. know hip hop smoothed brains little comes this, machismo constant self-praise, music, especially rock, less singer world, character, tells whole story. give benefit doubt I'd hypocrite. Boy people touchy, headlines short point. Everything printed fact. expanded explain two days first sentence story. Speak yourself. Ted ""I'm pedo"" Nugent. mean that's true OG COVID too, technically (though obviously very, effective there)

The point decrease infectivity point virus dies out.

If current vaccine reduces OG COVID infection 90-95%, variant 80%, 80% going reduce infectivity probably level virus keeps spreading (baseline COVID likely R0 2 4).

We see vaccines control infections far higher R0s time, like measles. Er nurses fast food workers medical industry. People become annoyance stop caring. hard get people working there.

Question know many ER nurses able judge so?

FYI nurse, agree stance insurance / big pharma hospitals created scenario. well beloved FDA allows shit foods/medicines countries banned years decades ago. American (which Im assuming are) unhealthy, eating ALOT non nutritional food. 20,30 year olds shouldnt going hospital anything aside injuries. Yet, many studies showing going things previous relegated elderly 30 years prior. No, there's zero chance. vaccination reduces covid mundane level risk accept every day aspects life. vaccinated, ""it's flu"" stops denialist meme reality. I'm expert source, random person internet, I've heard too. Maybe someone jump information though. People tend turn conservative earn lot money. think different article, said 78 6k died. Neither going anywhere public stores, still deferring curbside pickup rational?

Curbside pickup or, better yet, home delivery quite rational think value time.

I value extra hour hour-and-a-half weekend $10 tip give delivery girl. Germany, self-tests specificity 97 per cent approved, according PEI. is, 97 100 non-infected persons must detected such. sensitivity greater 80, means test must detect 80 100 infected persons. products approved far Federal Institute Drugs Medical Devices specificity 99 100 per cent, sensitivity 96 97 per cent, according manufacturers.

They're pretty damn good. positive test free PCR test confirm it. Lots people little problem it. tend ones come say eat raw sprouts, baby going die, 99% chance. /u/oath2order part /r/coronavirus antimasker contingent seem obsession mask rules mask mandates. sure why, masks really big deal people. 

He speak facts though. sub *heavily* brigaded people really extreme views. That's probably why. little birdie told Red Rocks expecting 100% capacity sometime June  like Trump said! It'll start going away April! (Didn't specify April) Weird, friend mine UK eligible asthma. type vaccine it? Countries world already require vaccines.

We’re 50% one shot already. moral good? No. Americans? Yes.

I understand country put others first citizens one worst outbreaks. trying vaccinate everyone we've managed get hold it. even half people yet. realise Sputnik V manufactured India. Thank you.

This two studies showing efficacy 90%. Hopeful great news true! reasonable precaution take back knew that, course.

One thing pandemic exposed well people grasp difference true belief *justified* true belief.

Basically, guessing right something proud of. ""100% efficacy reducing mortality"" really, really weird/potentially misleading sentence. mean? There's right answer that. one end, someone vaccinated deal covid well, asymptomatic shed virus all. end, someone catch COVID symptomatic shedding virus left right. risk low, steps taken, like wearing masks stay outdoors, lower exposure lower viral count one exposed to. That, weekend numbers usually lower. Kinda worried shot tomorrow, least side effects them. 

I’m looking forward sick :( Makes laugh people saying going get FDA approved another 5+ years. Makes realize priorities think covid low to-do list. waiting twindemic significantly 8k cases day Minnesota April want stereotyped, want classified. 
I don’t want hippy pad! 
I want house like mom dad! Got 2nd Moderna shot 3 weeks ago. overjoyed. Still wear mask public feel much safer now. still stupid people refusing get vaccinated. evidence months now, stated sub people like NAH BRO downvoted away. Thank advice! local Walgreens plenty spots. Hopefully won’t get disowned family getting vaccine. boyfriend already scolded made appointment. manufactured India places already far know. least B117 seems contagious necessarily deadly. good, outcompeting P1 351. 2 havent become prevelant Happy vaccine worked! people keep saying always right... Keeping people alive vaccine medical staff's job. us stay safe slow spread much can. cold morning take walks, trees keep ejaculating place (that's pollen basically, right?), I'd keep mask even COVID risk zero right now.

When pandemic started, already respirator working toxic fumes packages lighter masks garden work. things useful, dammit! good chance feeling slightly ill next day second shot. 
That... it. 
I played games day long get it... “terrible.” Fascinating. 

How effective/accurate these? I'm assuming they're scale PCR tests? say blood clots low platelets. mentions low zero platelets. 

There issue also blood clots, least seeing reported, MRNA. say article. pointed out, mentions instead lack potential clotting due low platelets... means risk hemorrhaging. 

The issue two things. Blood Clots low platelets. different issue, thing J&amp;J Vac. thank lot actually constructive reply. finally got first dose appointment scheduled Saturday!! Hiking usually outside I’d say fine. would bring mask case need go store buy something unexpectedly. making educated guess stagnate levels awhile see sort decline. I'd love see it. какой есть. There's lot skepticism claim, considering way Putin governs Russia probably warranted.

On hand, news Sputnik's efficacy good several months now, studies published reputable sources etc?

My understanding main issue vaccine inability Russia actually manufacture scale.  Especially *not* driving today would make car crashes go away even faster.


Which, uh, sounds pretty good me. hail WFH revolution! reduces pollution eliminates immediate danger crashes many people! live NJ I’m waiting cases drop least 1,500 day lower making plans. Well apparently donuts facebook say. Muh long term side effects, typical uneducated response.. coincidentally Ive learned facebook bans calling ppl Donuts.. source re: increased risk asymptomatic spread? read thing make lot sense considering know disease. doom already here. 31 million people confirmed gotten 500,000 already died. wonder dipshits admit real. hope Red Rocks CO. 2nd shot tmrw! happened UK. It'll happen US ideal sense? It’s going away...like miracle. 

Someone thank President. Anywho, personally try incorporate routine medical mask wearing daily life post-COVID high density/poor ventilation areas flu season. also like old people still flu.

This actually really good point.

When COVID gone, going realistic isolate forever, masks flu season could save lives enough us use them. Plus, I'm going old someday (and sooner wish, too). Agreed.

But positive figures Sputnik V rather consistent many months now, also sourced locations Russia?

I've impression good vaccine, one Russia struggling manufacture real numbers. hesitancy first.

She (my cousin) caught pertussis student brought school. Five years later, fully recovered, continues complications. clear ever going recover completely.

Fuck anti-vaxxers. broken clock right twice day.

When buy test CVS airlines countries accept negative test, attention. Switzerland part EU, bought vaccines. 
 

Norway, also EU member, also significantly behind Israel. large land area, population fairly concentrated. We're going put full-court press rural communities. Door-to-door outreach. Presidential Elections, this.   Same. 2nd Pfizer resulted slightly sore arm 12 hours. He's extremely concerned. be. think may little excessively so, probably. he's anymore right wrong rest us. assumptions educated guesses. timeline depends substantially vaccine, amount reduction contagiousness may too. pfizer good data suggesting chance spreading well vaccination nearly Almost same! get 2nd dose Thursday. Thank goodness. state, gap people first dose people second dose closing, fear means we're reaching top *willing* get vaccine. Time tell suppose know... I'm skeptical they'll approve via EUA pediatric groups given hangups including 16-17 year olds first time around. interesting see risk averse scientists doctors FDA pit themselves. Makes wonder people would vaccinated Trump still president. I’m still waiting 500 million Ebola vaccines going need 2014 Fauci's sole role follow science advise. Getting shot clearly advantageous health person fellow humans. He's going advise increases health. sells itself.

People need examine petulance. care health, wearing mask mall? Remember talking vaccine hesitancy here. ""I wont get vaccine Fauci give end date safe health practice pandemic"" Fauci. Incredible! That’s efficiency Novichok nerve agent used Alexei Navalny! Russians again. darker future preventable, abundant supply highly effective vaccines way prevent it. people get vaccinated now, smaller role COVID-19 likely play rest lives.

That ""bottom line"" actually pretty reasonable. did! video chat phone. said “thank coming here. eat things intolerances it’s normal flatulence indigestion. Congrats, it’s def Covid!” did. don’t know people think “mature” population leadership anything it. NZ Australia fucking islands middle ocean (Aus one least densely populated countries).

Slept two hours woke feeling fine. need lots clinical trials get fully approved. That’s are, clinical trial. 

Fun thought: first time mRNA vaccines put clinical trials. They'll announce public hearing we'll wait that. think would announced now.  people believe masks either. two year old enrolled pediatric study Pfizer vaccine scheduled start sometime May. daughter cancer weeks ago. can’t vaccinated anything yet, definitely Covid many months since 1. super careful able vaccinated. eligibility vaccination, extending EUAs. still Pfizer 16-17 year olds. states already done last ones yesterday Hope dies That's shame. wish anyone, even him. Ah yes, Steven Tyler method. Fucking asshole What's like sociopath? really see people object it.

They much tech west. really strong set professionals math/science infrastructure west (just look chip manufacturing). furthermore, export whole lot science math professionals, career prospects Russia sorta suck them.


you also see GDP. GDP made oil/gas raw materials.

This say produce effective vaccine, absolutely could. western technology. Yeah, percentage people vaccinated measles 90 percent. probably reach anytime soon. men dumb, born wave flag, ohhhh red white poo!

No way. Ireland fashions international business center tourist destination. There's way require everyone coming country wear masks.  15 countries confident July vaccine target date. stared going back gym little month ago got first dose Pfizer. one still wearing mask gym, today hit two week second dose mark ditched mask first time. 

Not going lie, feels good! ""no no... lets uh, keep up"" -Clorox CEO Even many 3s day care. son started year, plenty kids start younger that. really hope continue 6 months testing. Sir, Wendy's. probably talking trial, since said ""1% hospitalized die,"" absolutely zero deaths trials.

[My guess referring larger, real-world real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness full immunization (≥14 days second dose) 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections **regardless symptom status;** vaccine effectiveness partial immunization (≥14 days first dose second dose) 80%.

90% efficacy asymptomatic symptomatic. That's 90-95% effective rate means. means chances contracting 90-95% lower someone vaccinated. 100% infection rate among unvaccinated people, case 5-10% vaccinated people become infected. numbers lower.

The way arrived numbers vaccine trials last year. control group unvaccinated people group vaccinated people go lives. Let's say 10,000 people group. (unvaccinated) control group 672 people infected developed COVID-19, vaccinated group 51 people became infected developed COVID-19. (I made numbers show numbers mean, look studies actual numbers feel inclined). shows infection rate 6.7% unvaccinated people infection rate 0.5% among vaccinated people.

Your point still stands, wanted clarify infection risk vaccinated people high state. churro lady make fortune today. difficult imagine world fire. Can't ask EMA?  depend levels community spread, hospitalizations, deaths? Rather whether vaccine theoretically available ~35% population (clustered unfortunately together red states) want it?

I'm saying need wear masks everywhere deaths go zero. packed sports arenas large indoor concerts (for example) mask requirements there's still lot community spread tons unvaccinated people seems like recipe year.

I'm fully vaxxed last Thursday. couple weeks feel comfortable going small gym without mask, vaccinated friends drinks dinner, etc. That's long way thinking remove restrictions. Despite downvotes, appreciate people responding article. made post open, noncritical mind, happy see generated responses has. part learning journey. Yes, variables super complicated. this. virus crazy infectious. amount lockdowns travel bans stopped transmissions US India before. citizens govts stubborn af. many care masks taking precautions. question mutation going spread. question going spread, resistant existing vaccines?  trials showed 95%. can't use breakthrough numbers time delays.  

For example, lets say fully vaccinated, I'm person protected vaccine. lets say eventually catch COVID 3 months now. Well, next 3 months would counting someone protected vaccine reality I'm make breakthrough numbers 3 months. 

The breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards trial numbers given enough time. that's fine - 95% REALLY good. mRNA crazy tech miracle powers comes efficacy. Vector based mRNA vaccines similar work (delivery instructions body produce spike protein, mRNA uses oil coating around RNA vector uses genetically modified adenovirus carrier RNA). mRNA simpler composition easier manufacture large numbers (but fragile need stored crazy low temps) suppose. get fired don’t record charge code put general sick code million things could sick with. put covid-19 vaccine charge code obviously known happened amongst tens people team. [It seems Yup, sounds right. Leave it, lose it. Works way nearly every country world. Except IRS US citizens living working abroad firmly balls.

It’s different young adults lived grandma stringent 2020 people didn’t. northern ontario - back summer three testing sites. One hospital generating results, one close contact, symptomatic etc. one because. great. Especially things started opening wanted sure re-entering outside world. 'just site' shut fall. x-mas Easter surge cases. crazy concerning, 3-7 cases day. wait time tests 3-4 days, even symptoms, close contact. quoting cumulative cases per 100,000 people pandemic, specific time period? New York's much higher Ontario, close 35 per 100,000. NY state 2 million cases 19M population. Ontario ~430,000 cases 14M population. 

Cumulative data relevant what's going now. NY hit hard last spring, Ontario comparison. Yesterday, NY state Ontario ~4500 cases. currently worse Ontario based population difference remotely close numbers quoting. Pfizer moderna already used, Astrazeneca, soon CureVac well gets authorisation late may/early june.  going sorely disappointed.  live South Dakota 😭😭 Careful associating vaccine hesitancy Trump support, broader scale could introduce politics efforts reach hesitant individuals. 

There's clearly overlap, yes, anecdotally, around half vax-hesitant people within circle non-Trump supporters. I’m already vaccinated get another? Yes. 3% adults America immunosuppressed/immunocompromised, people vaccine partially, likely wholly, ineffective. Bozorgmehr highlighted need bring ethical reflections debate guidelines managing COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, Bozorgmehr poses questions medical moral pertinence public health policy implemented Germany since start COVID-19 pandemic, particularly concerning management migrants. According Bozorgmehr, **mass quarantine imposed almost 70% refugee centres assistance police, private security companies, army. refugees staying unsanitary conditions meet various guidelines, least primary rule physical distancing. allegations true, policy immense ethical issue, issue stake.**  important remember ethics morals apply standards values; ethics address questions feasibility desirability actions benefit society. Seemingly Germany, probably also countries, **the interests migrants sufficiently considered development guidelines**. Moving forward, governments administrative agencies need think happen COVID-19 pandemic, far over, prepare possible pandemics future.  providers research institutions worldwide engage veritable reflection practical ethics adapt guidelines clinical scientific reality time improve experience doctors scientists. past months, specialists confronted entirely new situation merits development ethical vision actions. legitimate needs fears populations also need factored in, without forgetting constraints inherent increasingly globalised world.  reflection lead embodiment practical ethics mediate tensions health economics, individuals community, distinguishing cultural temporal aspects.** Indeed, identifying identical solutions countries transforming heterogeneous health systems difficult. practical, pragmatic, rational ethical reflection therefore needed include different elements.  start COVID-19 pandemic, time act apply guidelines. Almost year later, goal define ethical vision capable bringing countries together, considering specific characteristics. time call question subsidiarity health worldwide level arrive useful functional coexistences systems basis different standards cultural values. Yeah, think combination reasonable people participating anymore. trials done serious symptoms mNRA vaccines. track asymptomatic infections. misinformed. HIPAA doesn’t keep anything anonymous. stops medical provider releasing information you. stop people asking protect things share people aren’t medical providers. Yes, one variant really mind getting... first People infected SARS-CoV-2 contact surfaces. However, based available epidemiological data studies environmental transmission factors, surface transmission main route SARS-CoV-2 spreads, risk considered low 

'Low' case relative routes. much zero multiplied number people touching surfaces. source clearly describes hours surfaces. know gym 100 people touch door handle per hour, unless everyone one sanitizes before/after door handle spreading about.

I'm sure number second source I'd need info determined anyway like said, risk could zero vaccinated people affect point.

You last quote says benefits *may* outweigh risks. saying small non-negligible risk, saying high enough can't even clearly say mental health benefits challenge it. way, go gym fortnight mental health fine, take attitude 'I'm vaccinated hit gym like normal'.

I appreciate effort went find sources far ' basically 0 risk' claimed.

Plus still see unvaccinated friends watching go gym either a) dick move part b) likely make relax safety precautions. Yes? mean 1 death 7 million doses *isn't* enough reason hold entire continent's vaccine program (indirectly killing people process anyway)?  
 
I'm shocked, nobody could've seen coming. Thank god week wasted coming conclusion.   already covid first one. long opened adults get take masks? something like this. Milton easier. soak 6 sacks toys hang dry cover. Shake water gets stuck duplo. Take 2 hours later. Also wipe toy kitchen, slides, mats, chairs, ride toys etc. seems like overkill it’s need stay open. would nice every week. group town opened it’s much work. Yeah, sub brigaded hard oPeN people beginning year, every thread full “fuck kids, won’t die, don’t wanna wear mask” people upvoted top. What? No, immune reaction second jab generally worse since active antibodies raise immune defenses. You’re one anxiety attack someone else’s karma lmao look way everything spreads, mutations things depend lots variable. know end like 5 years form over. knows best action US help everyone quickly use opportunity get power.

In reality US think save many possible instead keep dominating position world. Honestly travel restrictions doesn’t work. Actual quarantine procedure every international arrival quarantined cleared COVID works, government willing spend resources implementing it. happened? new variant? I'm sure agree. small window September testing situation got pretty bad seem lasted. Anecdotally, I've get tested 3 times issue. first time walk in, next two appointment. heard anything g recently people wanting get tested able to. Imma let little secret: never could taste difference wines. keep thing we’ll keep going “oh yes, blackberry. Exquisite.” handled quarantine part better America. That’s really debatable. Since America lucky enough vaccine factories soil, something Covid nothing actually handled first, think get brag say *always* better. making fun America, damn well deserved it. don’t anymore turned around, bad. Situations change. mean, suspend AZ blood clots-they suspended AZ absolutely terrible efficacy strain comprising overwhelming majority infections country. Claim shady lab funded Pfizer. Yeah…. mean I’m lucky haven’t forced work yet. inviting anyone wants go office daily since around August last year, they’ve forced least one person per team level office presence someone reboot computers whatnot support remote work. strongly suspect people office get better compensation immunocompromised person care health point worry that. Maybe wait little longer world isn’t fire. prediction while. kept hoping Memorial Day would feel like end COVID, looking like case.  *force* go starting become safe so, try ease life similarly reflects pandemic. I'm sure miss lives remember was, know do.

I would go several times week friends pandemic lot friends either fully vaccinated gotten single dose, I'm forcing see every day. week recently. take easy! true. silver lining never leaving home anymore family sure every visitor vaccinated, looking forward wheeling around rates dropped bit. put ""from weekend"" headline. Numbers consistently reported day day. see ""8,000 new cases"" think ""wow 8,000 cases Sunday terrible. happened?"" know daily numbers traditionally reported opted use weekend numbers specify headline get click. Israel gets Petri dish mutation. Hopefully numbers stay low. made vaccine propaganda tool. Sometimes look Russia can't even.

They behaving like drunk teenager. I'm grateful. think people feel shitty choosing get vaccine, many people world would likely kill access one. expected pool people get shrinking daily. math. die getting 🤣 That's efficacy works. real estimates closer 1/2000 mNRA vaccines, 1/300 J&amp;J.

And real world results proven far better even represents 0.007% 84 million Americans full protection virus.""

The simple truth fully vaccinated, pandemic completely different experience you. Could real number breakthrough cases higher? course. even 10x multiplier cases (which would huge error) still pandemic ending number. idea everyone went lockdown closing borders really work.

It can, course, super diligent I'm sure we're good that. method seems vaccines.

I real opinion it. Except keeping people home seem work also difficult. would honestly say parents get another stimulus stay home till kids vaccinated, Fauci thinks kids needs isolated, everyone else allowed least start going back sense normality. minute Norway Denmark started report potential deadly blood clots side effect AZ vaccine, decided pause rollout investigate, entire British media machine rabid British nationalists Reddit started scream ""political decision"" every single thread.

They still day, even country's health authorities acknowledged risk decided officially tell younger Britons take another vaccine possible.

So yes, see people talking age restrictions based political decisions interests, scientific decisions, conspiracy theory. Florida double population Right! surprise hasn’t way now... Depends mean ""safe"".  mean 0 risk? vaccine disease safe. risk vaccine far lower risk getting vaccine, I'd consider vaccine safe. demand 0 risk using vaccines kill lot people. Huh. honestly difficult keep track targets are. can't everywhere nice clear plan like instead try gleam everything bunch articles often switch saying percentage population adults. fair fucking idiots. testing capacity, IMO, bigger let contact tracing issue. 10 times amount testing going right now. point, minimally. would slow rate full vaccinations probably 4-6 weeks, US enough Pfizer Moderna doses cover entire population. JJ never really ramped large scale pause. needs serious proposal donate stockpiled AZ doses hardest-hit countries intention ever using them. awesome. And, I'm super jealous. Probably way handle flu cases people get vaccinated - cover them.

They'll continue make vaccines free easy possible, know preventing disease way cheaper. insurance policies even offer incentive get preventative care (like yearly physicals) smoking. lets real here, theres studies show people can't tell difference wines point besides real basic stuff, wine tasters mostly fluff anyway. BS way jobs bet noone would notice lol  serious symptoms, infection. Many asymptomatic. tiny sliver go hospital. 1% hospitalized die, sample small can’t even sure Covid killed them, died. WTF Really, free chicken dinners block proof vaccination? why? first shot provides healthy amount immunity week in? Strictly supply-wise, whole lot. Maybe extra weeks.

Intangibles-wise, could bit effect. larger (at least I) expected group specifically wants j&amp;j. never made available again, might lose population. There’s also question it’s deemed unsafe brought back online, going dampening effect people’s perception two? Probably massively, could bit think. step right direction,” said James Zimmerman, Beijing-based partner international law firm Perkins Coie former chairman American Chamber Commerce China. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said last month China hoped negotiate mutual recognition vaccines countries speed return international travel. even cracked open door Western visitors, Chinese authorities expressed concern burgeoning number fake vaccination cards available purchase United States. Back pandemic, learned could enjoy life fine without crowds. change behavior mostly response changing interests, random shootings secondary factor decision. picking them, they're using hell new work home culture then. Well, was. Checkout recent statements childrens hospitals seeing kids ICU alarming rates new variant. Yet schools/restaurants opening nothing happening spike 'remain hopeful'. time tell. 

Ticking time bomb blip time hope forget soon enough aside paragraph kids science/social studies classes. depends, low level ignore vaccines now, giving rest world. rest world vaccinated might even need get vaccines.

Okay, optimistic, need vaccination, nearly much everyone. Assuming everyone - like optimistic, pessimist line never get rid needs acknowledged. What's bribery get people vaccinated? Supposedly 74 breakthrough deaths 6,000 breakthrough cases 80 million people vaccinated US, puts mortality rate well 1000x lower flu - vaccinated. Taking skeptical factors consideration (eg everyone vaccinated comes contact COVID virus), vaccine(s) could thousand times less effective still level seasonal flu, assuming vaccination. get arm soreness? shot painless similar thoughts honestly. paranoid actually get it. What? man ate food, commonly consumed China. Stop looking excuse exercise prejudice. guess would no. suspicions, cannot find anything specific NI, England London. 74 million sure referring to. Hmmm ehmmm going find medicines? thought, believing news, nothing body simply fix problem itself? Exactly. Challenge stupidity. It’s game; it’s *your health* stake. still don’t know mild breakthrough cases result long Covid way mild even asymptomatic cases pre-vaccination. school opened August asked parents “what want do?”

I told long email “dont send kids back yet. catch covid kill parents grand parents”. replied asking “what exactly afraid of?”

This big waves hit CA. Dumb school board refused tell us going on. 

I really wish way hold public schools accountable withholding information. F Try telling Americans going lock hotel 14 days see goes. would burn shit ground allowed happen. someone that's 3 quarantines Asia (16 days, 14 days, 7 days respectively) can't say blame them. genius marketing.  states report state web site seen many good national Sam adams already did... Hope EU Sinovac. Otherwise might need wait country offer Pfizer-Biontech vaccine vaccine passport matter. isn’t statement fact, example CFR ~1% vaccination could misleading interpret comments were. 

There strong sampling bias 95% best immune function removed don’t catch Covid vaccination all, breakthrough still dying even increased rate, doesn’t automatically mean vaccine isn’t providing protection serious cases compared no-vaccine case. First worse second wife myself.

It's different everyone. worry it. all. Pro-vaxxer, pro-cannabiser. truly believe flu vaccine caused nerve reaction lower back lasted many years, like beyond 5. 

I also sick flu, YEARS afterwards felt tired time many many doctor visits discovered disease called Hashimoto's. previously labeled CFS. 

Hashimotos thyroid disease cause anxiety/panic disorder, lethargy (sometimes severe) sorts strange symptoms especially early onset. Modern medicine didnt good grasp (still doesnt) medication really helps. thyroid replacement therapy stop body attacking thyroid, hasimotos auto immune disease. 

Something got thyroid body didnt like non stop attacks it.  thyroid regulates many things body puts strain brain well. 

Japan forefront studying hashimotos (that's discovered named).  growing list evidence vaccines (well ingredients used still used today) cause. thyroid takes particulate foreign matter cant release it, body attacks it, thyroid grows. vaccine illness. tend think body ability fight illnesses, vaccines relatively new sense long humans around. fact, opened eyes ten minutes straight, blinked fast could, blink would still 100 times longer we've modern medicine comparison. Modern medicine complacent belief they've got great understanding, realize Opps dont learned something new.

Sounds crazy look nuclear radiation tell people take. Iodine. enough iodine body, thyroid 'consumes' take NOTHING else body. 

The body complex, modern medicine still stone age. think isnt 100 years grandkids kids look us like apes. basically say kids immune never acknowledge tiny super spreaders home one month you’ve home year nuts 1. Nobody denies risk outdoor transmission substantially lower. However, understand anyone honestly believe thousends people without masks standing close proximity other, screaming, singing, etc several hours travalling groups location protest organised bus tours etc pose significant infection risk. recent study published Journal Infectious Deseases includes comprehensive overview various studies regardings risks outdoor transmission Covid-19 whil arguing risk outdoor transmission substantially lower concludes risks outdoor transmission still largely unkown cannot neglected. ""Factors duration frequency personal contact, lack personal protective equipment, occasional indoor gathering largely outdoor experience associated outdoor reports infection."" statement study sounds lot like conditions Querdenken protest. 
2. Maybe U.S. sould give stockpile AZ countries then. fact start limited vaccinie supply. Decisions Government magically increase supply. fact Germany invested large sumes vaccine production produced tons vaccines. matter attribution. Unlike U.S. EU exported vaccines. maybe ""German"" deaths could prevented ego-centeres rollout, however gerneal happy live country embrace ""our-country frist"" mentality.
3. actual reasons vaccine rollout slow: poorer countries expensive mRNA vaccines lobbied buy AZ low cost vaccines; curevac slower expected; France wanted EU buy tons vaccines Sanofi massively failed development vaccine; AZ - German influence that?
4. already stated, Germany handled pandemic better almost metric look at; happy able go hiking pretty much throughout pandemic etc; claim German approach worst worlds Germany better countries measurable metric; feeLinGs arguments someone even experienced lockdown beyond me; sure lots room improvement - like countries latest stage pandemic federal system proved ineffective; however, small part overall picture.
5. supporting banning peaceful protest. protest would allowed protestors would show signs willing comply restrictions designed protect LIVES people btw also human right; matter balancing rights; example, protests allowed take place curfew hours time protest correlate infection risk; however, protestors allowed endanger live people spreading virus complying minimum requirements asked obey standing apart waer masks - German court would forbid protests sign protestors intend comply rules. think thats thing...any this. depressing. ever good news sub? think 5 weeks people first dosed get second + 2 weeks cases deaths. Congrats! I'm glad I'm moving NY pulling friend weed shit obvious Nope, health ministry told DR would three weeks delay (from start august end august) everyone 16 get first vaccines, 3-6 wk wait second vaccine. someone actually become noticeably infected, likely reason immune system react well enough vaccine, vaccine damaged immune system strong enough (for people immunocompromised example). Yeah created 5 accounts weekend already getting annoying spam emails. soon get kids vaccinated I'm going delete them, deleting even option. Unless you’re face mountain, probably done *have* to. feel you. GL getting wherever need Wine tasting allways bullshit anyway. cost chicken dinner worth savings healthcare system burdening us sick people hospitals. Here's 1 10 20 people still get..

I said ""can get"", ""will get"". said way exact reason specified. EDIT: said community spread also matters helped vaccine. basically made point trying make. J&amp;J 5% shots far. much impact think much impact going forward. certainly easier convenient people get vaccinated, think slows path herd immunity / normalcy much all. That’s head scratcher sure. Maybe time spent packed gate jetway? It’d interesting see there’s correlation delayed flights/boardings outbreaks since there’s basically air movement you’re jetway airports vary much terms space ventilation. thing thinking larger family flying together spread larger area plane. Six positives household scattered throughout cabin seems like recipe disaster. Atleast got something common astronauts Politics? legitimate fear? tough question always amazed analogy take sorts precautions lessen danger driving. licensing, testing, seat belts, air bags, speed bumps, stop lights, stop signs, DUI laws, insurance points, eye tests, speed limits, safety engineering, safety recalls, speed limits, road engineering, on.

Even safety mitigations, driving still dangerous situation. 

The Covid risk placed context everyday risk, special. young, healthy, vaccinated person, risk extremely low. I'm school working full time absolutely dying thanks lack spring break. teacher let all. Normally use things like fall break/spring break catch class since lectures/work added, time. 

We got Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday randomly sprinkled throughout semester instead. Well guess what, that's whopping 1 extra day MWF classes. feel mental health impact students. friends stressed beyond belief, sleeping, etc. would think would better let break test upon return. Sure cases may slip through, mass destruction. parent say kids need get house ASAP. driving kids crazy, parents crazy, severely impacting education socialization. schools need reopen ASAP kid activities well. completely agree this, actually. kind regret making comment, trying point it’s snarky tone, know what? agree fully opinion. apologize words. think I'd rage quit someone took issue wearing N95. Pizza aside. Let’s talk Scientology Norway, vaccinate strictly age + 20% essential workers already inviting 45+ municipalities. guess depends vaccinate course number older people. Seems silly go long without getting sick, get vaccinated wait immunity build up. takes two weeks shot.  one study released February said Pfizer vaccine may less effective obese individuals. think they've come anything definitive though. Short term? Maybe.

Long term? see it. 5 years COVID long since passed daily news cycle. Night club owners going want bother checking vaccine records (and turning people away) something that's even thing.

Even government seems unlikely. Even 80% population gets vaxxed, like vaccines last forever. CEO Pfizer talking people needing boosters every year. Ireland going keep turning away tourists current vaccine disease become relatively minor inconvenience?

And shit, we'll lucky get 80% population vaxxed now, virus killing hundreds thousands world shut it. way keep numbers 5/10/20 years. going convince 80% population get vaccine every year (i) requires 2 shots (ii) good chance absolutely knocking ass absence existential threat. literally proved wrong. difference kids aren’t significant risk Covid. Old people are.  everyone wants vaccine kids. absolutely zero deaths trials. 

Which misleading. trials done environments populations led zero deaths placebo control groups. [My guess referring larger, real-world 

 

The CDC's study showing 80% single-dose efficacy tiny - 4k participants (and young-ish healthcare workers). UK Israel ran much larger studies (24k UK one, huge 1.2M Israeli one.)

The UK found 72% efficacy three weeks **first dose**; Israel found 66%.

For one week post **second dose**, UK found 86% Israel found 94% efficacy.

UK study: study: must missed part explains India responsibility. Sup pimple Pete? like downvoted provided actual CDC guidance. Here's says Yes, vaccinated regardless whether already COVID-19. That’s experts yet know long protected getting sick recovering COVID-19. Even already recovered COVID-19, possible—although rare—that could infected virus causes COVID-19 again. Learn getting vaccinated safer way build protection getting treated COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma, wait 90 days getting COVID-19 vaccine. Talk doctor unsure treatments received questions getting COVID-19 vaccine. know Moderna, second Curevac dose gave slightly weaker side effects. worry. People respond vaccines different ways. vast majority all. variants seem worse kids. France 70% 75 group (just one dose), 50% 60-75 group. _Very far_ ""essentially done"".

I wish France banned AZ young people. would dance way vaccination center get AZ shot voluntarily. Hopefully ban J&amp;J well. Put dose worth Oxy vaccine bet get pump numbers up! I'll take whatever point. june something gone wrong. whole thing kicked single individual (former dr. Andrew Wakefield, looking enrich himself). He's still it, - he's long probably started believing bullshit. think would brighter beacon hope Israel fully return normal. fact many still required wear masks Israel gives lot apathetic people impression restrictions stay, bother? Evidence would best way counter act that, country excellent vaccination effort returning true normalcy would evidence people need. food served everyone takes mask time...at least like two hour flight last year, muesli bars coffee served...(I kept on...no coffee me). Food/ drinks served shorter flights, longer flights, done every five rows/ aisle window seats also separated timely separated...that might help. I've scientific evidence theory (other study read people seated close proximity got infected stated wear masks times, also NZ bound flight), sounds like common sense... Iowa done vaccinations... Hopefully start allocating counties now. Story County (ames) difficult anyone sign still unless willing drive elsewhere. I'm sure approach would possible data collected. average amount time infected person sick pretty constant, it'll rough approximation. Even estimating many new infections take place per day difficult. Sam Adams Budweiser already do. Look Google find info.

I'm aware that. 

The person giving hypothetical example long, close daily contact infected people. Yes, still wouldn't' 100% even without vaccine. fine, change numbers 20-40 people office want. point remains same. 

The real key vaccine protection effect community spread.   Beaujolais Nouveau... Isn’t curious talking re-entry cases hospitalization going up? sufferers severe anxiety also questioning vaccination experience?

I hate this. want feel happy got first dose Pfizer weekend, instead brain keeps sabotaging me:

* ""You look, know anything really injected?""
* ""What nurse messed injected saline?""
* ""It end day... vial gone bad then?""

I hate looking (it normally freaks out), checking vial, etc. I've cooped alone home going nuts year I've looked forward moment long react. Ugh.

Living anxiety exhausting. Good thing I'm talking therapist today. both. Though bit tired took extra naps. YMMV. Europe living rent free head 24/7 yet still allow UK arrivals par vaccination wise cases incredibly low. husband exhausting! COVID-19 left house. get tested. may cause divorce 23 years. 0.0071%?

Maybe wording meant vaccinated able ascertain vaccination status 8 close adult contacts 10-12 hours day. Let’s go! 15 years old wanna get with.  refer black people “blacks”? thank :)   people died asymptomatic. Yeah, easy forget we're talking small number large number, infection rate low. Millions people vaccinated, people die unrelated reasons. study establishing causality. deaths care about, excess deaths due COVID, that's reported. Meanwhile Canada...... Good guys. would shit talk USA. Look look us. Lucky get vaccinated august September way looks. They're looking people like yep actually like answer.

This doesn’t general co-morbidities covid, specifically people rare problems immune system. example, someone undergoing chemo might compromised immune system won’t react vaccine virus thus still high risk catching dying covid.

That small population magnified death stats “people caught Covid despite vaccine” precisely vast majority people normal immune function eliminated pool would still catch Covid despite vaccine likely immunology-abnormality makes death Covid likely.

Hypothetically, group makes 1/100,000, could reasonably account Covid deaths previously vaccinated. point people relatively normal immune functions react vaccine make antibodies, risk death even lower stats indicate low prevalence breakthrough infections concentrating effect rare situations within stats people die getting infected despite vaccine. Yep. vaccinated go 100 percent old normal time  So, lie get vaccinated, covid doesn’t end, become even harder convince anything science. 

So really, truth works. impression AZ ever supposed main supplier, much later (too late) game. never wanted rely AZ, wanted Sanofi no? least, ordered Sanofi equal quantities. 

If EU truly wanted AZ main supplier beginning working closer March 2020 set multiple factories EU. didn't, gambled like countries bought loads different vaccines. 

When one EU's biggest gambles failed, left relying AZ EU's intention. Vaccine manufacturing simple especially pandemic supply never ever sure thing. lot bad luck. say AZ supposed EU's biggest supplier ignores fact 1 billion vaccines orders manufacturers (as data Feb 2021, likely higher now) also delivering fast enough. 6 percent world *billions* vaccinated. Sinovac seem take longer work vaccines, looks like protection keep going up, according /r/COVID19/comments/mrpuh2/performance_of_vaccination_with_coronavac_in_a/ reported 73.8% efficacy symptomatic infection 9+ weeks. would take first vaccine available, strongly protective severe cases hospitalization.

And that's choice choice 24/7 anything everything body.

And honest people higher risk ones co-morbidities actually dying it... obese, heavy smokers, pneumonia like lung conditions etc.

Take vitamin c, take vitamin d, eat healthy, smoke, look door knobs, wash hands, everything fine let immune system job. Well happens act like jackass. go mask free yesterday....? confusing Bhutan Bahrain. basically vaccine never got chance produce antibodies late?

i sorry grandpa. rip hospitals airports, probably not. places, sure. He's feel CO VID FEVER  Good, 'cause felt little tired usual. looking forward good fever dreams...alas.  Hopefully final global wave covid follows Spanish flu model we've got vaccines time! That's 0.01% infection rate vaccinated people, 1.2% mortality rate infections, likely people already vulnerable (weaker immune response). Pretty damn good ask me. basically zero reactions shots kind freaked family reactions. unvaccinated, followed precautions really stayed home. vaccinated, I’ve gone indoor dining public sporting event guidelines still enforced. 

I still go work in-person everyday public schools, still concerning much covid still infecting students (I get email every 1-3 days confirmed case three schools). husband’s school pretty similar case count. So, makes sense teachers prioritized vaccines state. much people want say “cOvId DoEsN’t SpReAd ScHoOls”, it’s plainly obvious it’s present likely spread measures aren’t followed. widely expected likely keep coming Didn’t practice tons keynians polio vaccine paralyze 100 thousand? That’s price progress. like wonderful advancements happened medical breakthroughs camps ww2 Trust verify. Whoops! sorry. skimmed article completely missed fact Fauci said that. masks part MUST.

Feel less stressed 1st shot. hear 2nd one beast dont think time sound alarms, largely inevitable run people wanting get vaccinated Add Golden Corral gift card bam herd immunity. someone avoided covid long, chances catching dying next couple weeks also close zero.

It absolutely not, still enormously higher dying vaccine.

They think decision make sense looked actual numbers, otherwise would stop dozens things massively dangerous everyday lives. Yeah damn - know got first jab bit surprised sore really was. mean nothing horrrrrible. definitely felt like 3ish days throbbing. really really want believe this, skepticism words, never go back normal always risk another wave. article likely three cases examples prolonged viral shedding SARS-CoV-2 virus rather reinfections COVID-19,"" Wuth said Sunday email Detroit News

Starting tomorrow, going cough face every day schedule vaccine appointment can't reiterated enough. Yeah has, people shrieking New Hampshire. worry decrease 1st doses?

Besides, got J&amp;J ones? odd also though.

if someone avoided covid long, chances catching dying next couple weeks also close zero.

you can't expect people make decisions think make sense think society would better did. Mostly seems like mask mandates stay long term. states considering permanent/indefinite rules tied type metrics.   least he-who-shall-not-be-named mess testing distribution. still full month away. NE plenty people vaccinated then. first biggest thing state needs worry getting young people shots. are, urgency 55+ population had. know several people appointments (1st shot) next 2 weeks, even though open appointments, keeping original appointments. 

The second big getting shots hesitant. 

I worried state handling getting shots 16 group time comes. correct. law parents first scheduled second September shame there’s many still act like children...and refuse free vaccine. they’re juniors &amp; seniors once, kids medical exemptions. article saying probably didn’t die COVID reported tested positive. new infection old infection still detectable PCR. read medical data... normal. body exposed respond first inoculation.  respond second. science all. 
Get inoculation!!! got first Pfizer dose today! made kinda emotional I’ve lost much COVID: friend, entire first year college, etc. I’m hoping return normal soon! Wow, Canada fucking sucks. Oh see, yeah, guess might right that... Ok. I.will consider Alaska place US vaccinating visitors states vaccinating them? neck arm got vaccine little sore. pay US taxes. US taxes helped pay vaccines first place. So, they’re supposed go without government couldn’t arsed put aside little extra logistical effort distribute vaccine giving away? 16-18? never approved age range, anything would've expected Pfizer name. previous post mentions working graveyard shift might contracted security guard custodian actually hospital employee. That's way think involve lying. can't think single thing annoys world impact personally...? said extreme Christin colleges mostly referring evangelical colleges. Catholic Universities mainstream protestant Universities almost certainly require vaccine You’re poorly informed, friend FL tested NY rates think would worst outbreak nation. It’s really upsetting see attitude ignoring Covid leaving people exposed leaving everyone blind extent problem. ok... worth it. Side effects means stated worldwide immune system responding appropriately. fearful compromised 20 yr old child. Yah,,, 24 hours yuk immune system job.  Beats hospitalization, ventilator death.  hard understand. 
So incredibly grateful get vaccinations.  words.  hard people.  ever headache?  Fever.? Muscle aches?  viruses?  fearful vaccine.  may save life. Same. 3 6yo registered person school next fall would really like vaccinated possible, soon feasible. think will. We've averaging shots 10% population every week, still full month away. lot things change then, changes better. Got mine today! Bloomberg tracker shows well. think might people fully vaccinated though we’re getting there. every day vaccination slowed thus way people dying actual virus, yes.

Also, kinda right here. 100x dantegous enteriley safe still safe. hard time coming safer things use examples... really insignificant yet questionned like inevitability. like everyone suddenly believes win lotteey. everything annoys everyone (yourself included I'm sure) personally impact them.

I guess strange concept me. Getting shot prevent it? What's point? Yo don’t luxury Canada don’t manufacture Covid vaccines domestically, imported Europe India. 

The US won’t send us vaccines (except AZ ones aren’t approved FDA anyways) every American able get shot. don’t disagree hold grudge President Biden I’d probably expect Canada position so. 

It is.  No, going rant really prefer keep things civil argue internet strangers. keep 2 yr old home way. Best luck ever deal irrational age group human population.  don’t see people want mandates dropped still lot community spread. masks best tool vaccines getting control. Let positive get sub 1% like LA drop mandates. Israel also actually pay said would?  Makes sense, least something pair 😜 Yeah, sad sell PS4 get Xbox, oh well. actually 2 hours labor $30 . looked aldie, luray, lessburg... spent 6 hours 2 days... Wasted time.

West Virginia, va beach, va tech? capacity needed terms trained, non-burnt-out human beings. can't bolster inside year throwing money problem. mentioned article, leaving country residence could permanent - don’t necessarily allow return you’ve left. Visa situations quite complicated even normal circumstances, lot people can’t travel US back right current restrictions. tax paying American citizen shouldn’t give home get vaccine taxes helped pay for. US going force non-residents continue paying taxes abroad (unlike pretty much every country planet), need everything provide citizens start giving vaccines away countries. Sadly, think day ever come. even transportation. feel like days even vaccinations. hope wrong, even fully vaccinated, still wracked PTSD this. offices. people still working home 90 %± time. also sold hash 80's. forget that. CT well:
All adults: 61% least one dose, 
Whole State: 49.4% first dose, 
Whole State: 32.2% fully vaccinated. Considering hasn’t documented case vaccine directly killing anyone kind don’t believe purpose vaccine end pandemic via herd immunity, pick list feels like following science doesn’t. 

If enough people don’t part, never hit immunity, put undue burden healthcare system, raise costs insurance, keep making mutants one fully escapes still hurt businesses. 

So basically selfish people still drain society regardless bullshit reasons are. Try Whisky's. drink Lagavulin Ron Swanson  willing around fully vaccinated people, no, plans drop weird arbitrary point future. plan seems take essentially zero risks forever (nevermind getting vaccinated *already* cut risk essentially zero). Oh yeah getting mixed sentence “Fever common second dose younger group (15.8%) compared older group (10.9%).” Personal guess, 4th July nation wide tested positive covid last week, went symptoms work bit back office return work notice doctor. However, home sick washer dryer broke down. landlord/realty company saying refuse send technician provide negative covid test result, told doctor CDC moved past guideline people test positive 3 months symptoms subside. accurate, shit luck laundry test negative?

Obviously government policy plays role here, compare US US, NYC Dakotas, example. Populace areas clearly much extreme spike cases deaths. dumb pretend otherwise. sit say everyone locked house 2 years cases would lower, true, logically nobody comply risk leaving house contracting virus equate loss 2 years 80 get live for. Canadians spent year pretending true US accepted reality right away. That's NB smaller outbreak ND.  Look average last week. UK really kicking ass.

I think would awesome live London one favorite cities world. Super unfortunate timing though! get bus hit vaccine?

At point mRNA technology seems capable dang near anything. placebo 10 people 0.5%, 331 people 15.8% vaccine group fever. think reading data wrong. 10.9% see vaccine group among +55 year olds. vaccine interested Canadians (the group suspect asking upvoting question) I’d say multi trip day come south COVID exposure risks worth it.  oh man, i'm going that's it.

The solution people always. europe stronger tied together, every country state dystopian Orwellian story. drink lot water else get floored. ""The government tell do"" *is* political, though. 


It's ignoring science sake sticking man. thing know  Dose mean erection impossible people get covid even vaccine? magic number situation dynamic. example UK variant becoming dominant, herd immunity threshold 65-75% closer 85%. SA variant becomes dominated threshold shifts again.  also critical juncture large amount spread combined moderate amount vaccination yields high replication induced mutation rate strong selective pressure variant escapes immune response.

People want simple easy answer unfortunately isn’t one. TY clarifying. 

Re: America pandemic handling - vaccines thing I've felt solid, positive marker America since start pandemic. Everything else disappointing. Though would felt personally worse UK/EU-style lockdowns.

My lessons learned pandemic might be: move Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand beginning next pandemic, fly back U.S. hoard best vaccines first. Hasn’t update month still holds really well virtually trouble getting vaccine flu shot. Called got appt day, 2nd dose auto scheduled even got 1st dose day. 

For doses 15 mins, time wasted filling 1 page form.

This local Walgreens 5 mins house. I'm sorry hear that. hope mild case. get those, expressed disappointment nurse first dose said luck probably got placebo. said significant arm pain two days common placebo reaction could almost bet got vaccine. said people expect dramatic side effects everyone gets fever. 

After second dose bout diarrhea next evening. eaten anything would suspect cause stomach upset. arm pain two days, like extreme exercise. 

I never got arm pain influenza vaccine vaccine, far remember. Well, I'll find soon enough, case take whatever vaccine offered. Yeah, I'm looking move back US within year.

Fed living draconian restrictions everyday life, certainly reimplemented next winter bet. met absolutely zero nurses worth salt. ER nurses particular atrocious. schedule vaccine 7 days week. entire communities won’t, that’s public health hazard. 

Personal liberties take backseat good populace times like this. like 60M pushed forward Q2 That's silly. Doctors get better treating gun shot wounds. mean, told they're probably looking for, said ""that's insanely restrictive."" So, blame saying it. That's they're going get back: ""That's possible.""  that, vaccinated people gotten Covid, likely get severe symptoms it. also key part vaccines. curiosity, Walgreens?

Drive nearest red county weird isn’t it. easy thing pretty effective. number epidemiologists infectious disease specialists similar ethical concerns. world decided vaccinate low-risk children upper-income countries vaccinating high-risk people low-income countries. Even argument “take care others” (which based politics, medicine), inevitably much broader spread variants targeted approach global scale. think so. I'm trying say Moderna/Pfizer better J&amp;J. understand trials performed different conditions different times. right said ""just good"", point Moderna Pfizer offer level efficacy 1 shot would considered good enough ""full vaccination"" gone 2 shot schedule. done trials single shot results would still good enough get EUA, people got shots would considered ""fully vaccinated"" 1 shot. Even city city vary lot. city live closest vaccination site 30+ minutes away line get shot 3 hours busy times. faster drive parents' house another county shot 30 minutes (including wait time) longer Surge. Dew. Site shut up. P.s. antibodies one temporary aspect immunity.  definitely urgency, rough estimates available.

When Pfizer submitted Phase III data adults Nov-Dec 2020, took ~3 weeks submission pre-EUA approval. similar timelines /u/CrystalMenthol mentioned.

The timeline review Phase III 12-15 y.o. roughly plus week. amount data review less massive time, pediatric studies involve extra scrutiny (deeper review consent there's higher standard adverse events). Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner Pfizer BoD member, also mentioned month.

Edit: problem people wear masks future. saying everyone see huge benefit it. Everyone know situation management planning terminating WFH set date due availability Maybe cases go scary. folks already act like hellbent being. human petri dishes breeding variants. would get vaccines would make way less scary. Happy getting second :). Officially 100 NYers I've registered vaccine appointments!

Not heros wear capes. (Or maybe wear cape, dont know). quote Fauci. Yeah! I’m Thursday, right friend! looking 64 healthy, previously Covid-infected volunteers 18 30 years old studied controlled, quarantined conditions least 17 days,

I guess ethics concern test subjects volunteers. don’t think landlord obliged follow CDC guidelines. doctor give return work notice without testing you? time appropriate play shots.

sHoTs, sHoTs, sHoTs... EVERYBODY  "" fewer quarter deaths India medically certified ""

This always case rural India. one knows true count is. anxiety around shots general. People telling I'm going want die next day definitely made soooo much worse. stop me, got 2nd dose today, I'd lying said I'm going sleep easily tonight. I'll waiting death symptoms people keep talking about. 

Luckily far I'm ok, hours knows! Rich countries vaccinating babies ""third world"" even jabs old people huge makes think whole tri-state same. I'd looking on-and-off found nothing, suddenly hit Walmart entire week open. must stumbled right someone keyed something in.

Got Pfizer shot 1 Thursday, holy hell arm hurt 1.5 days. Shot 2 May 7. pretty variable. sore feet munchies. Another one partners slept 36 hours. One buddies trouble lifting arm it.

I worked whole 24 shift shot went fine. Thank ❤️ Real good points. used 2 sick days recovering vaccination  friend asked appointment Walgreens gave shot right then. would great. 

Since they’re mostly school right now, wonder shot clinics like 50s 60s. Remember lining several times elementary school getting latest vaccine. FYI NY site tend add data evening. I've read Walgreens thread already case.

Since second reported case happening, think see easy mix happen. Yes. Here's translated key paragraaf:

The vaccine candidate CureVac currently final phase clinical development. European Medicines Agency EMA started rapid investigation procedure February. Depending clinical data, company expects approval EU second quarter 2021. CureVac wants able **use corona vaccine June**. Me, too. took couple grocery store workers telling like behind scenes decide cleaning containers takes seconds worth Even important realize 6,000 tiny, tiny fraction people vaccinated.

TL;DR: Vaccines work. Seems ""wait see"" 40k per 100 million still get per study.  sure believe this. 

Dr. Desantis says immune vaccine. work. I'm way less tolerant jerks face.  expected. important part figuring indoor mandates lifted well. say Vaccination open adults doesn’t mean it’s completely available everyone practice. still work getting people vaccinated. fully misleading. cannot compare efficacy numbers like say one shot pfizer effective J&amp;J. trials done different times year different conditions. Really good article fair, many reports SA variant UK. Kent variant dominated past 4 months due infectious is. current vaccines thankfully effective it. Boomer here. Got first AZ shot 2 weeks ago. going picky efficacy rates variants running wild case counts going like F16 afterburner. Also 100% protection hospitalization death ought good enough anybody.  brother EMT, volunteered oversee people look allergic reactions back January. One nurses gave empty vial contained shot souvenir. dad wanted us clean use shot glass post-vaccine family reunion.

Totally wrong many levels love spirit! lol Maybe I'm optimistic think downward It’s you. Americans whole get vaccinated get this. It’s part, like voting. able population density? may generally use 'Bolsonaro' 'humanitarian' sentence. frankly, don’t know there’s ever drug modern history higher priority

The Polio Smallpox vaccines maybe consider modern history, regardless COVID vaccines short list. Pfizer wanted get deal India Indian regulators needed additional testing done locally willing waive despite existing approvals countries Pfizer dropped application. think Japan similar requirements got early doses ran mini trials lot native alaskans skeptical vaccines, especially new ones. history vaccines Alaska dark. lot natives basically used guinnea pigs TDaP vaccines caused many lose lungs. Plus added challenge distribution remote nations, language challenges, general poor education. many people refused mindful anyone themselves. live area likely 50% population might get vaccinated. strongly conservative. reasoning them. Exactly, longer paying attention say, would rather listen German regulator seem thier head screwed on. See: Haha, dad. know funny? Giving family covid. :| Indeed are! feel two children 12. Im due second vaccine next Friday I'm protected mean are. feel safe taking public gatherings vaccinated. Yea it’s similar death rate covid. chances get point vaccinated person minuscule. Talk doctor Reddit.  him, makes even worse backyard neighbor old, overweight, lives alone SS, bad respiratory problem can't even walk dog. also poor needs go food banks churches get food. get vaccine cause thinks poison. gets COVID likely kill her. she'll probably lose house. least wears mask though... Fine really. Left arm felt little tingly right shot feel way whole day, nothing else really. able go run workout day got shot. take mid afternoon nap yesterday may due fact got early. today feel perfectly fine. positive spin pre-emptive complacency many states going see spikes due relaxation rules. hurt Israel cases finally started dropping. unless even infectious variants, downwards place trend. curious annoys you. seem personally impact you. Unfortunately doubt CDC, Fauci, you, anyone, convince vaccinated resisted masks begin keep masks children approximately 4.2% population immunocompromised. Yeah strange unless somehow investigated wasn’t Covid least factors; low number great zero would amazing. good number people didn’t care last year either. ok, someone choice two medicines, one 100X dangerous less effective, really think take it? wait weeks get one want? think depends entirely whether able vaccinate enough people reach heard immunity. we're able get around 60 percent total population vaccinated see numbers drop like rock.  Haha, fair point. like call case start think completly normal think others. living Swindon punishment enough, there's need fully vaccinated individual still contracted Covid makes think numbers severely skewed... Orthodox Easter May 2nd! 🇺🇲 listen u/dish_dick stupid probably finish high school. 

Keep informed. knowledge power.  Word. Overrun moronic right-wingers. sad see. baffling way people responded vaccines Fauci, people. University Notre Dame requiring students vaccinated returning campus next semester. would imagine Christian institutions likely follow ND’s steps require vaccination least vaccinated upon arrival international students. I’m personal liberty don’t think vaccine mandatory, really stupid fucking hill die ah okay, didnt know june 15th goals lol mean estimates based historical data. would preferred official statement sets explicit target meeting be. appreciate help all, fact answers reddit threads bit letdown. getting downvoted that's first heard well. mean didnt harris say campaigning wouldnt take vaccine trumps name it? Pretty political me. Vaccines also protect severe symptoms therefore hospitalizations deaths. Cases growing USA, fatalities continue drop - bet related. They’ll drop masks see numbers inevitably fall cliff next month. hilarious read “New England never ever let restrictions REEEEEEE” incredibly obvious restrictions would gone ASAP rate we’ve vaccinating. Get shots. See bar more. Maybe so, socially engineering people less selfish wait deal pandemic.  mention good chunk population apparently incapable objectively interpreting data themselves. data confusing. 1% death rate doesn’t sound good. That’s much different unvaccinated COVID. But, say 9 deaths asymptomatic unrelated COVID. So... others severe COVID, possible causes? ages? deaths people 80 90+ would mean something different people ages. race. pandemic. finish line fuzzy best come everywhere once. 
 
Telling people clear ""end"" creates fatigue situation virus changes. 
 
We need straight talk, people feel betrayed next 3 week lockdown rolls following variant spread. Californian referring Newsom. :) I'm referring Boris' June 15th goal UK. supposedly purpose vaccine people wanted took mild illness.

New strains, often prevalent even news starting take notice, potentially mutarions well understood despite wide spread.

Thosbisnt gpimg away anytime soon amd got vaxd one strain doesnt mean act like over. hit 50% vaccinated adults mark. believe roughly level vaccination, 6 weeks ago, Israel's stagnating/slightly increasing cases (very similar ours) started going freefall changes. Definitely hoping see thing happen here, sake US itself, model pattern hope rest world. mRNA typically comes side cell. vaccine works. that's negligible real world benefit traded significant real world cost. vaccine drastically reduce chance getting serious covid. importantly sooner vaccination rate rises - vaccine - hight population immunity rate- less likely going need vaccine.

If right covid vaccines better chance pointless - like smallpox vaccines second thought said vacation assuming californian referring newsoms june 15th goal, im pretty sure conservative estimate since numbers paint different picture. 50% californian adults least 1 shot already, vaccinating 500k people day ever since opened eligibility everyone. napkin math shows month so, 75% adults least jab, may limit due vaccine hesitancy anti-vaxxers. honestly would surprised announces state reopens may makes big hoopla blowing expectations water EDT vaccine symptoms mild soreness arm.

However, quarantine always implemented exposure. live PA rural areas one getting shots. pretty bad. I'm bigger town getting shots people know drove middle nowhere get shots cause knew one would want there.. Hopefully changes soon. sad see people anti hel-thy-neighbor. year long I've seen people unable make smallest concessions others may better time. I'm even telling people anything, get vax, get vax, point INCORRECT say CAN'T spread get vax. folks, safe, spread shit know internet. First NBD working garden weekend. Second shot Moderna laid three days solid wasn’t quite right 5th day. read article last week Fauci mentioned older  wait, he’ll get mild case feel like isn’t big deal. thought cat scratch fever. It’s recommended area takes 4-7 days develop symptoms.

I’m doctor, listen.  Whaaaat actual fuck. treated certain treatments, general rule:  point is..for fence may fib tell this. I’m Mississippi..the unvaccinated already living. Anyone may sort caution already vaccine. wanna get threw caution wind go “well ya know I’ll get darn vaccine means Mexican restaurant like small town MS open back up” could asymptomatic then. cases, second time different variant virulent. depends lot things one day study DISAPPOINTED least mutate something worse cause quarantining them. sounds like headline Onion lol. Chatting doctor could give reassurance, get help need. meantime, routines let chicken noodle soup brain. Start relaxing one morning (I practice preach... browsing reddit coffee, lol) It’s last three lines really hammer home sick fuck "" think it’s net negative anyone try ensure everyone overly cautious."" 


wtf - TRY ensure people safe afraid we're going scare them? someone scared comment think going get first place. think get point, need encourage people get it, again, think missing mine. glad see .007% stat published prominently, 6,000 may alarm people without context. would get tested 7 days? Agreed. wondered thing, would guess bit thoughtful objective. Thank kind words. hope see may grieve support alcohol makes people emotional wobbly. think going take time lot us get kneejerk reaction ""COVID exposure?! Must stay away!"". That's say in-laws acting rationally - they're not. think one things that's going ease time. 

It really helped media - recently - latched narrative vaccinated people could still easily contract spread COVID. data coming says that's true (which would line know vaccines overall, one), think lot people still minds - vaccines prevent serious illness absolutely nothing else, even vaccinated people ""at risk"" COVID exposure. likely change time, know sucks guys now, especially son. 

I'm surprised COVID test taking forever come back. least assuming US (and apologies aren't), thought turnaround issues mostly fixed testing. Could take rapid test least get something back wait? I’d gamble 74 least one super severe co-morbidity. daughters friends get tested He's list universe, he's fucking Tom Hanks crowd. coughing long months plus getting exhausted walking 10 feet. hope worth it. Oh 100%. saying something I'm entirely *not* rooting COVID one rare instance. said thought dying. That's get finally got tested, think. totally assuming bunch positions things I'm saying. People get vaccine....I've living...I'm fine. 


I'm telling people shit. I'm correcting someone wrong dont' walk around thinking we're invincible shot.. get second dose tomorrow also! Ho things await! Link?  covid December.

Shot 1 made sick 2 days.

Get shot 2 Saturday, expecting sick again. Ugh.


Still way better covid. sucked. Shot 2 felt it. Felt like brother punched arm (started, dunno, 12 hours shot?), woke middle night chills. trouble getting back sleep.

But extent it. Felt 100% morning. Spending life irrational fear need protect germs viruses generally treated form mental illness. apartment rent controlled? necessarily false negative, bad timing test. 72 hour window, could easily infected viral load low trigger positive, incubate sweet, sweet levels getting plane. thang Covid. Fair response buy that. Even though bed ridden quite long time he'll say bad. Anything confines bed pretty terrible book.  spell moron? N-U-G-E-N-T! I’ve told get tested 7 days. Obviously quarantine observing symptoms. said really doesn’t matter. It’s funny. definitely don’t take opposite view thing it’s bad thing. shreds say unvaccinated required fly anywhere dont see would risk it. takes one person half planes infected seems. Presumably we'll use real drugs treat him. comment thread brought comfort hearing Teddy's terrible, horrible, good, bad ten days. Thank bottom heart. 

I hope &amp; find comfort if, hopefully when, forced circumstances beyond control hold timely memorial, many people join to, know, grieve stuff. CDC says wait least 90 days you’ve it. thought dying.

So, hoax happens millions people, also absolute worst thing ever happened personally. Surely, u r saying that’s good thing Biden? Lol Serbia really kid divorced parents getting two sets presents christmas. One hopes.

Still huge percentage saying wont get vaccine. Sick sides shit. stop. Maybe just...stop sister husband won’t get vaccine, they’re overweight 2 year old new baby way.

Absolutely ridiculous. actual song lyrics 

I've got inhibitions
So keep keys ignition
I steal car like got curse
I can't resist old lady's purse
Jailbait look good me
Jailbait set free
Jailbait look fine fine fine
I know I've got matter time
Well care thirteen
You look good true
I know probably clean
There's one lil' thing got you
Jailbait look good me
Jailbait set free
Jailbait look fine fine fine
I know I've got matter time
So tell mama I'm back town
She likes us boys time get down
She's got craving underage
I might mama's brand new rage
Jailbait look good me
Jailbait set free
Jailbait look fine fine fine
I know got matter time
Honey look nice
She's young tender
Won't please surrender
She's fine mine
All time, mine mine
It's right baby
It's quite right asked mama
Wait minute officer
Don't put handcuffs me
Put I'll share you
Jailbait, jailbait Lord works mysterious ways🤭 grandma quite indignant subject. mom (science teacher) trying explain still wearing mask around despite vaccinated grandma telling ""We're immune!"" 'I'm accepting possibility I'm wrong' voice. also tried explain difference immune unable spread hearing it.

I love much, attitudes like reason we're going keep seeing cases. It’s 84,000,000, .007% infection rate. I'm due second shot Moderna tomorrow decided wait days I'm work case become sick. said completely fine, anyone's worried useless shots, ask postpone convenient date. *84,000,000 call rushing defense anyone, ok. know guy song he's gun advocate. forgot casual friendly discussion big no. pick side fight here. Comparing pointless 20 year war with, most, 3-4 year pandemic stretch. 
 
Blind optimism help anyone, increase fatigue later when/if waves people need lock (see New Delhi, right now). think that’s it’s successful—you don’t develop immunity vector itself. Scheduled day isolation ends! covid sucked. want vaccine actual trial data study. Jump figure 3. around day 10 vaccinated placebo groups start diverge. Democratically elected leader might even able secure second term. Let sink in... Name calling, nice reports people experiencing delay shot side effects.

If continues get worse would suggest contact healthcare provider. otherwise take tylenol drink lots water. US government decides fair contribution every individual based variety factors, including income foreign taxes. essentially lowest tax bracket Americans abroad, two governments taxing lowest bracket could effectively put people poverty. reach certain income, income double taxed. US government decided fair contribution.

But, sure, guess you’re right. actual dollar amount paid taxes isn’t high enough warrant providing vaccines. great idea! Everyone wants vaccine bring tax returns in, anyone lowest two tax brackets isn’t eligible free vaccines haven’t contributed enough tax dollars give vaccine free. buy Pfizer Moderna fair market value. Come think it, maybe use revolutionary new idea sorts public goods services! Lowest tax bracket isn’t allowed enter public library, lowest tax bracket isn’t allowed children attend public schools, lowest tax bracket cough dough firefighters help house fire, sort thing. Man, think you’re onto something here! Dilma completely moron created economy crisis Brazil worse pandemic.

Stop lying justify political agenda Yes, things generally don’t happen Connecticut first place, lol. Starbucks paid employees like $300 get vaxed. Also, since region really one big blob people (I want say like *Blade Runner* really, since region actually gorgeous), plenty people LA make drive far San Diego work relaxation.

It's quite situation Minneapolise St. Paul Dallas Forth Worth, close.

I've worked lots people would half time LA half San Diego.

If Camp Pendleton nuclear power plant looks like giant pair boobs, able tell two cities apart. PA prioritized smokers grocery store workers. last part though, substantial amount people won't, included. know risks Covid, immediate risks vaccine. Covid death pretty much anyone dies non-trauma-related reason tests positive Covid. vaccine death someone dies day jab next, 2 days later, someone drops dead, nope, related vaccine, died xyz organ failure. likely spread Covid-19 fully vaccinated? can't seem find info anywhere. parents fully vaccinated traveled Florida Texas. shots, days. high risk. avoid hit 2 weeks? several hours, hope hanging there. heard feel soon 6 hours. Mine's tomorrow afternoon, I'll boat. long first Pfizer shot immunity starts kicking in? I've seen there's \~80 percent immunity 10 days, take full 10 days reach measured 10 day interval? got 2nd Moderna shot last Wednesday. Started symptoms Thursday Afternoon. Fever, fatigue, bodyaches. Tylenol helped symptoms lasted Thursday late night. Friday little fatigued nothing much. Saturday Sunday regular weekend days. However today(Monday) morning woke legs feeling tired fatigued ran 5k marathon. confused. thought one incident thinking much it. took nap evening 1 hour thing happened. legs felt overworked tired walking running miles. hamstring calves feeling weak. anyone seen symptoms. worried much. planning taking tylenol tonight see goes overnight. suggestions helpful. Kind fucking joke far behind UK despite astrazeneca borders, like jesus christ incompetent governance, still got first shot, idea getting it. Laughable honestly. Look best comments, tell bots upvotes... 

Why?

Just create ""were vaccine"" vibe...


That FREAK YALL TF OUT?!? Biden’s america /s I'm 20 healthy long terms effects vaccine virus fully known yet. seen many healthy people lose taste smell permanently things unrelated. 

Public health thing individual health. tell it’s 95% effective people go back life usual pandemic people vaccinated, may big individual risk it’s still huge social risk 

Just consider typical commute transit user: 65-passenger bus, 40-minute rides 10 people replacing every 10 minutes, total exposure: 105 people way. That’s 1,100 people exposed commute week. I’ve simplified numbers 95% efficacy *not* mean risk gone herd immunity established. That’s still 55 transmission opportunities average. course, there’s reason believe everyone exactly average clusters people claim vaccine isn’t working

There reason extrapolate snap back pre-pandemic habits expect things go back normal COVID still widespread based purely individual risk. mask advisories always emphasized *social* risk individual risk saying CDC must abandon position they’re hypocrites risks vaccinated *individual* misconstruing guidance 

It needs happen gradually actually assess things going, acknowledging positive test results lagging indicator transmission incubation period

Prudence fear recklessness realism I've looking w weeks every day, cant find appointment. first doses available cant select bc theres 2nd dose appointments. Maybe wash face? face greasy? I’ve never grease face mask live somewhere it’s hot time...have never heard complaint others either . try using face wash wiping facial oil / makeup remover pads help. 

Regardless doesn’t matter wear masks short times stores crowded areas. don’t even think twice time. It’s really big deal people (with non greasy faces least). got second Pfizer shot 9 hours ago feel virtually nothing. thing first one- side effects. got 2nd 8hrs ago staring feel shitty. Congrats!!! I'm ""low-risk"" individual. 
I've given advice wait get vax'd.
While persons eligible, availability prevalent. higher risk persons less privileged communities find difficult obtain vaccine. ensure others higher risk area lower privilege, abstaining getting shot.

Plus, NPR said I'm ""at risk population"" give others chance first. also explains comparing positivity rates regions even times sort worthless. completely worthless (lots testing 10% positivity rate bad however slice it, situation bad, drive positivity rates up), get differences real exactly getting representative samples population. j &amp; j. 3, clinical trials, showed 100% effectiveness deaths. obviously, article said, possible corona breakthrough vaccine, extremely rare. real world 100% effective death, pretty damn close Thanks! Yes drink lots water get rest fine. 

If start shortness breath trouble breathing definitely consult healthcare provider. 

Without downplaying seriousness Covid, average healthy person like assume death sentence anything. Sigh, want move back LA, alas, Silicon Valley clutches also said Covid would gone Easter... 2020. bet senior citizens can't get vaccinated, medical reasons. [(Possible go nightclubs, may want visit grocery store occasionally.

If everyone grocery stores wears mask, help protect high-risk seniors can't vaccinated.

In general, require masks easy practical, help reduce spread COVID, even can't require masks everywhere. Man whole upper body sore second day, felt like done 2000 push-ups. reality 1000 though. pretty much seen people crying others supposedly complaining reopening 2nd shot Moderna, 1 expect post shot symptoms arrive? High schools right now. Pfizer one available 18, bit harder find pharmacies. 3 ? Moderna , pfizer ? sent me. Seems bullshit I’d like know why. heard vaccinated person’s chance spreading virus much lower aren’t vaccinated. agree vaccines good broader containment disease, end day getting sick main motivator get people go doctor get vaccines.

Most people either care understand epidemiology. anyone think Novavax ever approved US?  USA border control state dept accept results this. Currently USA requires returning international travelers negative test origin. Instead take us travel show results accept? crack head guy? still even alive? this, every vaccine manufacturer put price life taken vaccine based odds. say anything odds 1:100,000 also cause death come promise manufacturer families compensated say 10 million dollars.

You’re telling me? someone offered vaccine, vaccine practically guarantee get serious case covid, guarantee die one crazy outlandish possibilities, next kin family given 10 million loss. 

You’re telling people would still like nahhh???

Basically force vaccine manufacturers govt escrow type account crazy unlikely outcomes. Pfizer offer best protection least side effects seen, son got Moderna hardly side effects major ones. cuomos reopening strategy based different criteria every states. actually really easy understand flow chart, ill try transcribe yall:

has woman come woodworks accused something? 

if yes, loosen restrictions small amount, big enough get media attention, enough cant loosen restrictions anymore

if no, keep steady, andy paper cited suggests, especially regarding symptoms months later. You’re free directly quote otherwise. Nah I'm sure they'll lock every school child random day force get injected. Even homeless getting vaccinated ... mean them? know exactly Replace rhetoric “pandemic” “war terror” sound identical George W Bush. 

Newsflash: still there. victory *still,* twenty plus years, “right around corner.” think story pay first batch, ordered vaccines issue payment those. 100% sure. point won’t die get it. Make sure squared away too. Proof Covid causes brain damage. get choose whether want vaccine? metric fuckton high-paying jobs.

Of course, half 100% remote now, easy live Garden Grove work LA. shame demand going get closer 50%. 90% democrats board 25% republicans thinking legit 75% saying hoax take away freedom. Probably mid May trickle people getting vaccinated topping around 60-65% vaccinated. Well, got Biden Trump. Joe hook up. Well let's ask 3 million people dead covid-19 worldwide would prefer taking day work feeling bit achy dead. 

Oh wait, can't. They're dead. actual trial data Curvac's shot? seems like pretty promising vaccine ask me. Also Mariners. Gun owners diverse. drive prius, got vaxxed, many guns. 

and dont ED. chill. Dude 22? Get job, get apartment, live life. first shot, little 24 hrs. 2nd worse lasted 48 hrs. predicted sun get rid 2020. case could've anybody. like anybody tell do. case government. Recently church. also talked bleach. people telling California currently getting hit COVID harder anywhere country. problem never capacity use doses, number doses available increasing steadily. sacrifice? could said could put 10 million (or value life at), per expected blood clot death fund people end getting it.

The faster ramp economy would easily cover additional cost.

If someone 3rd world country told “if take vaccine die blood clot basically 1 million shot, you’re family given 10 million US dollars long waive right also sue us”, think would still say nah?

Fuck wouldn’t say nah. Go clinic end day ask extra doses discarded anyway. Yes I'm completely shocked quickly tone sub turned around. posted Jan - Febish, downvoted oblivion state stimulus proposed comptroller.

On bright side, finally know comptroller is!

(Just joke, that's one words kinda know means really, never care enough look up. 
 know Cyril *Archer* comproller, says enough.) 21st June Can’t find statistic anywhere...

Also convenient defended claim last 6 hours comments existed yet twice upvotes. Wtf Nope. like anybody tell do. school teachers told everyone vaccinate he'd find reason it.   Stay strong, northern friends!

We went hell last year, keep isolating masking that. optimistic safe.

I understand fully frustration wait vaccine. sat four months people got shots eligible.

I hope ends soon. agree. whole body ached day forced take day play games listen music. awful. really, sacrifice good many situation; people refusing save someone image important person's life. vaccines weird shit you’re looking giving billions people. tiny sore spot injection site gone day. Drink plenty water eat something solid before, fine :) Kind like signs remind us wear seatbelts... also save lives.  you’re serious getting vaccine Canada go clinic end day ask extras going discarded anyway. Yeah face oandemic. changing I've never owned car. Toronto, generally get around bike share, public transit, and/or walking. (Speaking bike share, might well throw shameless plug /r/bikeshare, co-moderate.)

How public-transit situation college?

Cc: /u/hupcapstudios. What's really weird people living California keep telling somehow getting worse worse here, makes sense me. see numbers myself. assume numbers even remotely accurate. WHO’s official estimate many 10% world population infected. China outright lies numbers, really think they’ve double digit case numbers 14 months? No. don’t know anything Pakistan, since do, trust numbers accurate, maybe tell exactly differently less mature countries like Canada, France, Germany, etc, initially “beaten” pandemic... hadn’t got downvoted bringing gut feeling “idk man wouldn’t sure that” conversation clear data happens country reaches certain level vaccination. There’s “hoping” anything. It’s dumb offer “skepticism” without critical reasoning evidence support “skepticism” I’m walking tour guide Scotland gets paid tips basis. Americans understand concept way better lot Europeans assume I’m salaried even though I’m fairly clear I’m not.

Besides that, Americans great love accent impressed old things. excellent audience, plus far prefer English though Yanks struggle say things sometimes often willing try. presumed positive early days US covid, first jab killing me. Like totally incapacitated. Nausea, headache, fainting, joint pain, can’t think clearly, exhausted, weak - it’s 36 hours. ABSOLUTELY want get second jab. also got MMR vaccinations growing up, also later found antibodies/protection mumps. getting mumps. 30. required you’re close contact someone fleeting moment. required everytime go outside. New England lowest seropositivity rates nation. well educated, I'm pretty sure. political thing showing nationwide polls holding true New Hampshire, sides political spectrum eager sign vaccine. able look vaccine disinformation using critical thinking skills figure true.

It hurt moderna vaccine manufactured NH MA. hard believe conspiracy theory something manufactured backyard. That’s sweet say us, thank second shot nasty side effects. took 3 days fully get back normal.

Definitely excuse avoid getting it. take time work. thought low class getting vaccinated drugstore post-shot waiting area chairs aisle socks, ace bandages &amp; lice kits. imagine getting shot gas station. thought according number people US media claims Putin attempted kill ""deadliest"" nerve agent aka scary Novichok actually 0 0. Dear Americans please continue supply us Russians good material memes! Incompetent people trying play clever diplomacy politics buy credit international market! joke. Yeah sure want kids get it. don’t give shots anybody wants them? We’ve giving shots anybody wants almost two months. weeks ago, saw don’t even need register online more, roll clinic get shot. much urbanised though, even UK people living narrow coastal strips. Australian cities fairly big centres higher population densities European cities like London. regards Australia disadvantage compared US UK.

Australia one advantage much accompanied freights, i.e. trucks. could managed US UK really wanted. matter priorities. One club wish belong to! there's Australia... gonna take decade get mine swear suspect people get covid getting vaccinated like making someone who's superspreader something. reporting death rates, swear heard man BBC say experiencing 200 deaths daily Doug Ford (at least publicly) crackhead. Rob. Good good good. Great job NH Thanks info. Yet still makes little sense hang non vaccinated people one fully vaccinated. Well may enforced required. Check DC government website. bad CVS  said next democrat hoax referring Russia investigation previous hoax. believe Trump refers Russia investigation denying existence collusion, stands reason calling Coronavirus hoax denying existence well. I’ll never cease amazed people willing stretch thinnest veil ambiguity degree. supporters certainly thought claimed hoax well became politically viable deny anymore. good news, wish even higher. can't begin understand could considered negative headline. Let's get number 50% Huh, okay. thought decreased smaller value, mistaken. It’s required enforced I’m md drove like 20min get first shot. Use locator sites check back every hour. appts giant booked went back tried anyway guess what? guess someone cancelled something one appt suddenly available. booked fast I’m 4 weeks away getting second. Keep trying. There’s vaccination sites over. son ok? That's 78 who've died (~400 hospitalized) 75,000,000 fully vaccinated U.S. sad still died, statistically virtually nil. No, unlikely vaccinated person silent carrier. Vaccinated people [90% protected even asymptomatic aren’t infected, can’t spread it.

(And even get asymptomatic case, know much less likely spread symptomatic case.) vaccines prevent medium heavy simptons coronavirus. 
They effective. One effective important compared importance everyone getting vaccinated They've almost doubled last month Colorado. Survival rate hospital dramatically improved.  Hey. know else ""Long Term"" Data for? 

COVID. 

Thanks playing! That, plus fact probably severe cardiac inflammation well possible kidney damage. really nasty thing virus hits hard, effects last long time actually set future problems issues, especially already older. That’s count deaths positive tests long getting confirmed. don’t think people truly realize nasty bug is, it’s respiratory virus, affects blood closer HIV infection. know conclusion says, read too. articles references agree conclusions. reading scientific article look data references gather data from. take conclusion face value letting author guide you, take stated critically see came conclusions see interpretation data pretty wild.  One worst humans. Good. ...and pedophiles. Oh cool there’s name it. 98.X% chance surviving even get it... pandemic lol Im western pa.  snagged extra Moderna shot 3 weeks early driving boonies begging people fill slots. I’ll driving 2 days get 2nd. 

Population density doesn’t matter much rural people think keeping Covid bey.  people still get together church, multi family indoor gatherings, school meetings, gathering shows/concerts, Covid Covid. 

There plenty sick end fine also see people passing away would fine got jab. Ted Nugent pedophilie Fever delirium, prayin Great White Buffalo. get hopes That's terrible. second week back spring break hallways pretty empty kids whose families traveled quarantine. control safe careful! including Hillary didn't. point somewhere?

Christ, less 7% people protected (two doses). I'm currently pretty fine. waking up. Woke couple times night injection spot incredibly sore go hospital actually dying, check quick send home. Once, years ago, terrible case influenza, actually real thought dying they'd admit hospital. went ER, looked five minutes, sent home told hot shower take Tylenol. 

With covid, go hospital stop able breathe. think so, e22ddie46. remember used respect Ted

Honest question, Ted ever done anything garner respect reasonable folk? Hercules dope

Do people actually think this? Unless gets hospitalized almost dies dies, fuel fire real pandemic. I've Moderna shots. fine times. coworker actually covid first time, felt rough second time. He's one heard felt bad. Hope got good kind He’s conservative icon, there’s lot overlap conservatives Christians hope long-term after-effects destroy life. Xena always better. Everybody say ""Geddy Lee"" I’d try non-chicken nuggen’ts. gripping paranoia ten ordinary men. Unicorns kick - ass!!!! -To Orgazmomobile!

-What?

-My Buick Century! person dying good.

But ""divergent opinions"" accurate assessment guys views.

Like dismissive Covid19, act similarly Covids one eighteen. 
Or dismissive Covid19 didn't/aren't HIV, flu, 'the Spanish flu'. 
Or conspiracy theory people dying things doctors 'being forced Covid19 actual cause death.

These divergent opinions - they're misinformation bad propaganda. checked page local indoor climbing gym they're back open. Might swing today! since January 2020. Yeah I'm never going back way things were. You’re never going eliminate risk 99.5% reduction infectious risk near 100% reduction hospitalization isn’t enough acceptable level risk return normal vaccinated? Nope. Day 100 making claims evidence Never said that. get 70-75% vaccinated get back normal little help contact tracing 'zero' covid come itself. That's assuming world vaccinated soon too. Except break ""rules"" every chance get. mean, loved kid. Disagreeing someone's opinion gatekeeping. Exactly, thats issue number alone worthless. made similar number unvaccinated people, would mostly useless comparison people looking two tiny numbers everyone would go ""Oh, okay, goes tiny tiny? What's point then?""

And, yeah, we'd need lot work get comparable numbers. 84M includes people fully vaccinated single day. Zero chance die COVID fast. many people vaccinated weeks? bunch them. likelihood one person (vaccinated none) dying weeks low. Even huge numbers people dying, individual risk still relatively low. makes feel better, covid back March. Covid million times worse. ran fever least 8-9 hrs probably more. ass 2-3 days. racing heart rate freaked days. least 8-9 days could function somewhat normally even got breath tried run. Plus, I'm convinced long term symptoms it. would much rather shot covid. Compared covid shot mild. Well yeah, tits, Hercules still great. right Harvey Weinstein think I’ll believe her.

Edit: saying that's excuse! studies things like affect menstruation. :) Yeah odd number. 
- Maybe number recommended scientists super extreme - like 0 cases week. 
- Maybe scientists can’t agree number (some referring flu like numbers, much closer are, etc). None want relaxed (not caring lives). 

I heard 1 new case per day per 100k pop (7 day average). 

Flu cases 292 cases per 100k seasonal Covid deadly. Flu 1 1000 die vs Covid 1 58. 292 / 58 5. potentially 5 good number. flu seasonal matching average accurate. 

Another number could true “herd immunity” enough cases find case (from traveler) track contacts isolate vaccinated like 2 weeks cases gone. would places 0 cases come go different places. Probably much lower 1 per 100k. 

What number would pick?  bet yell people don’t wear mask. wish death human, Ted Nugent suddenly alive anymore I'd shed tear.

Fucker deserves feel uncomfortable. going convince people worried COVID get vaccinated unless motivation so, clearly stated target removing masking restrictions *personal* motivation get vaccinated. vaccines great, 99.5% misleading bunch reasons.

Example, friend mine became ""fully vaccinated"" days ago (two weeks second dose). He's counted number someone fully vaccinated get COVID it.

Which makes sense. Lets assume got COVID second considered ""fully vaccinated."" Well, would still count someone protected getting COVID, two days long enough symptoms show, get tested, result counted. again, that's got infected first moment.

Obviously, short time scales looking allowed lot people get COVID even vaccine nothing. people fully vaccinated long, due time takes become fully vaccinated daily vaccination numbers higher months ago.

And that's even taking account stuff like demographics people got early vaccines different general population, etc.

No. Theater sure. disinfecting registers every customer, blocking every bench park, refills soda fountains.

Trying think others, I'm sure there's dozens examples point. remember last year said Covid gets grip India, could really grim. Yet withstood first waves rather well despite population developing nation status.

So hell happened now? new variant sole cause? Idk downvoted literally says lol. got Simple Simon I’m one defend Putin, excess deaths stats put Russian government tell story full, lies. Russians dying phenomenally high rates. 

They aren’t marked covid. 

Russia hiding excess deaths though. 

It’s strange. obvious undercount combine accurate death rate count. live southern NH every place I’ve still requiring masks. Walmart outdoor outlet mall weekend everyone still masks on. This! one wants talk COVID already. yesterday, talked esteemed virologist spent last year researching COVID said natural immunity effective vaccine. traumatic year. guy also sing nonce something like Everyone wants schools open. whatever spreading around Brazil gets rampid here, affect children more. Say goodbye person learning again. really hope get things control!

Or could keep vaccinating adults, wearing masks staying safe infection rates go down. 

Also helping rest world get vaccinated cut mutations. daughters school going 5 days week person since September(they half day Wednesday). sept Jan 148 cases(there 300 students 28 staff)From feb 2 cases. Honestly think kids staff it(we never got sick didn’t test could asymptotic). cases level probably month two.

Also one child’s school got super ill died covid. that’s good thing too. wait turn Canada. 35 year old, healthy Canadian eligible 1st dose Pfizer Moderna, community in. 

I booked appointment get 1st dose within 2 days. issue second dose, isn’t planned mid august. Canada taking UK approach vaccinating, delaying 2nd dose 4 months recommended 21-28 days. support all. irresponsible approach. Yeah guess point, half Canada basically stay home order matter. first Pfizer shot bad, felt crappy afternoon. Second shot literally side effects sore arm two days. like flu shot.

Everyone's different. Yeah severe fatigue ~8 hours Pfizer #1. I’ve heard lots people “mild” covid say exhausted could barely get bed week more. vaccine fatigue even fraction experience covid, I’m damn glad getting vaccine. Would hate feel like days time. second shot yesterday call sick today. felt mostly fine laying bed, moment tried moving could feel every muscle body. Vaccine shaming universal don’t see point kid First shot Pfizer worse second wife myself. 🤔 UK still opened vaccinations everyone.

That's strategic choice though, government trying get 40s ~99% first dose vaccinating anyone younger reserving new shipments second jab.

Technically it’s available actually finding appointment impossible. know eventually I’ll get I’m putting long possible. July huh, 

Any information vaccines 6 years older available? 🇺🇸 😂😂😂 that’s amazing. Thank this. think biggest ass pain would quarantine upon returning Canada. never pre-covid road warrior. checked every hotel room &amp; bed carefully settling room. Still sure referring to. deep throating fountain

Challenge accepted! Neither AFAICT. doubt we'll ever get charged, given Feds made abundantly clear vaccine free Americans reject attempt charged it. Seems like large number subscribers fit bill (except concern trolls). &amp;#x200B;

Here key points article:

* study done city Kragujevac 4th largest city Serbia, 1st January March 31rd. 28.630 people included study vaccinated 100.000 people vaccinated.
* people, 8.11% unvaccinated people got sick, 2,03% vaccinated, 1.17% revaccinated, 0,57% got sick three weeks revaccination.
* risk getting pneumonia three times less people got first dose, six times less people revaccinated 15 times less people got revaccinated period three weeks passed.
* Percentage people hospitalized: 1.23% unvaccinated, 0.16% got first dose, 0.06% revaccinated 0.02% revaccinated people 3 weeks.

When comparing people got sick, even though vaccinated, statistics follows:

2,3 % received Astrazeneca got sick (disclaimer: Astrazeneca revaccination Serbia three months first dose far nobody revaccinated it); 2,2 % received Chinese Sinopharm vaccine got sick:, 1,8 % Sputnik V; 1,1 % Pfeizer.

Pneumonija developed in:

* 0,7 % people got Chinese one;
* 0,3 % Sputnik Astrazeneca
* 0,1 % Fajzer.

Hospitalization rates:

0,2 % people got Chinese vaccine; 0,1 % Sputnik V NOBODY got Astrazeneca Pfeizer hospitalized!

The study concludes vaccines effective, Pfeizer develops immunity fastest Chinese Sinopharm slowest (three weeks revaccination), especially men 80.

One thing would like add, article, around Mid February - March, UK Strain became dominant Serbia. That's good point yes. far know sinovac applied approval EU yet. May EU accept apply it. mean PIPEDA since article Canada, right? I'm sure commenting without reading article. UK NHS monoclonal antibody treatments like US

These standard treatment certain cancers NHS, started trials monoclonal antibodies treat COVID back September, I'm sure results conclusions. Nobody draw line sand want risk blamed.

They absolutely called leadership. Keeping people COVID purgatory clear answers not. Oh no!... Anyway. ""Habit"". anything year going weird it. meh... feel like wearing mask, wear one! like jaywalking. Cops going waste time ticketing unless going way cause problem. end summer masking done venue venue, according management operators feel safe. retailers like Trader Joe's still require masking, want comply, shop there. kind like security checks sporting arenas check bags. Sure overly intrusive, want deal screenings go. First shot, really sore arm two days.

Second shot, fever chill 14 hours shot. Second day, body ache, headache, hangover kind feel. 3rd day, back normal.

2nd shot Pfizer fun. CFR higher Japan/Korea/China Europe US/Canada? article say, seems implication? We're never getting rid thing. effectual control sloppy management makes billionaires richer keeps plebs compliant? That's right there. Putting eggs vaxx basket, lack better terms, wise choice. Compliance, along vaccination, public health measures key, seems though many it. else anyone explain western provinces? cases starting tick here, hopefully quickly slowed. UK basically data need.

England 1 death COVID yesterday, hundreds, vaccine side effects negligible comparison. curiosity, get EOB wind billing insurance it? Ripped wax pen within 5 mins after, smoked 4 dabs 30 after. Slept while, that's it. Hey, there’s still time 🤞 deal health related anxiety experience wouldn’t matter looked nurse giving shot, tasted vaccine make sure didn’t taste like saline, watched remove vial freezer let thaw. anxiety would come scenario means wasn’t done right.  severe allergic reaction mrna vaccine US, doctors generally (but always) recommend J&amp;J (pause vaccine aside) instead 2nd mrna dose.

Even 1st dose Pfizer Moderna, 1 dose J&amp;J fully vaccinate 2 weeks shot far we're concerned regardless. get teens kids. emphasis set, there's emphasis making coronavirus zero chance spreading. False equivalency dude. go protests drunk driving laws (not actually drive drunk itself), idiot, get arrested. helps, mom, stepdad, big immune reactions second shots husband 3 brothers react either shot. one brother went 5 mile run morning second shot. really high chance feeling fine :) that's usa would trump reelected. live Americans favorite tourists? thought generally bad reputation tourists ha Italy something like this, Italians abroad elect MPs. honest, I'd rather vote last place lived in, since elect proportion MPs ridicoulously low relative many Italians live abroad. one whole North America. outdoors, pose essentially zero risk anyone, demonstrated massive protests US summer little (if anything) increase spread. US that, tell masking distancing often ignored protests (and form protests general) well. vaccine available long enough determine long term effects, short term. mRNA Yes, it’s illegal. true now. Moderna approved standard refrigerator temps 30 days (see page 2, 2 8 degrees C). last heard Pfizer approved storage higher temps transport lower temps looks like 2 weeks freezer temps.

These fine almost US, except possibly extremely remote parts West/Alaska.

That’s explained literal first sentence article. second paragraph. Bolsonaro sounds like name salad dressing, useless, corrupt would-be dictator. assure that's case Latinamerica. I'll agree give people Latin America choice American vaccines Chinese vaccine, almost everyone pick American vaccine.

But that's case. know American vaccines better choice matter. Otherwise can't work, covid raging countries. 

For instance, American indifference Chinese pro activeness, Brazilian government allowed Huawei bid 5g spectrum there. Huawei forbidden big, current government(Which Anti-China) choice beg vaccines.

(Btw name Majoras Mask reference dig it.)  Hey, good news vaccine likely preventing becoming anything bad! “She urged people assume others gotten jab, needed to.”

My personal scientific also small sample showed friends family vaccinated either connections health care industry lied.

The real reason ask people got vaccinated ahead turn won’t see way after. work remote, know plenty work retail don’t complain either. I’m sorry masks upsetting much. sounds like life really hard diabetes... fuck guess. That's assumption based opinion messaging.  Read threads. Cases declining? first time while, previous 2 days seen decreases new cases compared 7 days prior. Deaths basically come close plateauing slowly declining while. bragged lying masks

That's myth. said wanted conserve supply, also change recommendation due learning asymptomatic spread.  immunity

I agree said that, hardly anyone even aware he's stated threshold, may believe everything says dismissed it. poor evidence people think he's credible anymore.  good excuse taking long think we've seen Brazil stupidity dominate even dictatorial regimes stupidity power. different mindset here. white seeing government personnel taking CoVid patient hospital, white thinks individual accuses gov stepping person right. yellow seeing this, things patient sacrificing convenience community health. different mindset leads different response toward pandemic.

Along that, majority people knows got vaccine miserable side effects. long, course they're fine, still. her, want sick miserable vaccine compared possibly nothing actually getting COVID. course knows people age die COVID lots people (including myself) side effects vaccine. says still ""probably get it, maybe"", lot excitement, maybe little anxiety. like getting fillings cavity bothering you. lot expediency.

It anything conspiracy theories, believing virus exists, current/former administration, things like just... side effect reluctance.

The person know COVID miserable it. 2 weeks sick. Nothing serious, miserable it. He's fine now, lingering effects. rush get vaccine since decent antibodies previously, feel strong need rush get it, especially since might (or might not) feel miserable side effects. probably eventually, enjoying feeling miserable moment.

So way, first person know. figured I'd add perspective I've seen, know lot different reasons people gotten shot yet. EU UK AZ? EMA already published updated guidance. think Swiss regulator wants publish own. yeah dose hours 6pm pst idk, walgreens first dose like said really quick process there. I'm sure second dose even easier since less paperwork fill (I'd presume) kind agree you, except compassion chunk Americans -- 10% maybe? -- would get vaccine, waiting someone tell safe. lot reachable hesitant people I'd like see outreach folks.

Let’s face it, democracies stupidity allowed dominate long enough stupid people organize news pretty shocking me. rates survival high stats show, doesnt make sense inherit risks faulty vaccine That’s drives covid. exactly happened Wuhan, America. enough tests means people aren’t isolating spreading family members today??? read this? I’m gonna chase Cherokee chicks trail beers. Ya feel me? graphs may flatten due testing constraints. Labs get backlogged serious cases tested, pushing test positivity rates. I’m vaccinated. everyone live able get vaccinated yet; recently opened up. also teach children ineligible vaccine. yes, I’m taking precautions. I’m - seeing friends outdoors, example. I’m back pre-pandemic normal think enough people vaccinated yet. think it’s little early suggest someone ready relax cautions yet anxiety problem. get herd immunity people still don’t feel able socialize all, might cause concern, that’s still months away. brother's high school closing 2 days covid cases, done pretty good job, open since August, closed days far. think may lying case counts, spread attributed actual school. Masks man complete idiot. thinking there’s “Covid 1-18” still using racist language it, he’s nasty piece work.  reminds Robin Williams bit talked telling someone early 2000s 2010s one last specials, believe. “There’s black president White House” “Get out!”

Can’t imagine telling many things that’s happened since passing. May rest peace. Natural tobacco still extremely addictive harmful. I'm getting mine tomorrow!

And read news indian mutation got depressed again. works India variant think access immediate problem fix hesitancy, bet lot people can’t take work get vaccine, dont time drive center get it. seems getting better Plus coke ICEE popcorn tasting like Michelin 3-star meal. think George Carlin wrote mad libs became true. poke usually done blunter object needle 😬

Frequently fleshy blunt object. Heart breaking sad. 

I hope get control. No, understand that, data get covid despite vaccinated chances hospitalized remains worse.

Logically means get symptomatic infection vaccines nothing. also means AZ J&amp;J way worse mRNA vaccines First kid?

My daughter (2) recently decided dog shit looked yummy. far nothing bad except breath could wake dead

Kids tend bounce back anything except genuine emergencies never understand reddit- skews overwhelmingly young- seems care minor difference healthcare ***so fucking much***. could understand redditors 50s older, makes sense.

When account everything- include price- Canada's healthcare system ranked 30th world, 191. people reddit constantly talk great is. US' ranked 37th people reddit constantly complain it.

It's bizarre assume baked culture website reason. Nice, help make vaccination quicker vaccinated, much less likely get sick, you’re much less likely spread others. That’s different situation last summer you’re still unvaccinated now. loss public trust scientific institutions awful, yet also (as we're learning more) fault former president.

Still sure answered questions though. I'd certainly appreciate sources them. I'd like better understand coming :) somebody petition state this, south dakota would reach highest vaccine uptake rate union this. Yea drive hour first shot tomorrow, also thanks helping ppl kind stranger. good ole immune system boosting smoke.  conversant plasma

It speaks now? Getting second dose hour, fantastic! free covid every kid! like one ginormous chicken pox party class.   don’t want scare you, smoking/vaping anything great lungs. Head r/COPD you’re curious. handle going bar month fully vaccinated. one thing nervous COVID, felt like forgot part large group setting. Nearly panic attack leave.

Even COVID thing, going take time readjust back social gatherings. Ideally sort mix would nice. Wfh pros cons. Would love could person important times year work home regular work flow. think definitely problem acknowledged need work towards resolving it. Now, means think solution lock wear masks indefinitely. let vaccinated get back normal soon also focusing resources towards getting vaccine-hesitant people get shot. Given seeing India might wanna figure fast. Still waiting numbers come actual number dead China. know guys way 5,000 deaths, subtle. They’ve got mass vaccination clinic there, it’s appointment only. signed website got email sign appointment days later. clinic extremely well run, tend lot openings. think someone Reddit told month ago, I’m case know people struggling find appointments willing drive. Perhaps people charge insurance also significantly fewer tests back than.  Canada buy lot them, also lowballed offers got late delivery timetables ones bought haven’t even submitted EUA yet. (The largest single order Sanofi/GSK.) opinion - BIG elephant room...that one wants talk about. already perceived Vaccine Nationalism States.

What mean 'perceived'? fact vaccine nationalism exactly matter perception now, it? argue that's good thing not, struggle see fact vaccine nationalism would debate... difference ""no matter effective lockdown are"" unless draconian.

Even draconian part debatable, month total lockdown worse two years lockdowns?

I'm comparing rich addressing argument poor people living tight. lots migrant workers living tight China too. That’s HIPAA works Next time lead one. always good straight position. Thank you! enough vaccines, we're vaccinating vulnerable; right we're vaccinating ages 60 up. 

My hope we'll get Pfizer vaccines, we'll OK Janssen vaccine, age cohort get vaccinated August. think it'll earlier that. idea like places personal experience that's even close true start rumour plan save liberals eradicate conservatives see makes willing take hey, least sounds like already successfully made rough test relationship. Congrats! Democracies don’t ban protests. 24 already double vaccinated baby article thousands Indians dying daily basis extremely heartbreaking stories somehow make UK fucked. 

ffs empathy, world revolve around guys. sucks even more, ugh. hope get vaccine soon enough! Stay safe They're also giving free coffee don't. 

Note: heard podcast, may 100% correct.   Mate China draconian lockdowns. simply cannot India. Obviously, covid situation disaster bad management point comparing two countries rich are.

10% India lies extreme poverty zone per rankings, whereas 0.5% China lies zone. Ironically, family big COVID exposure first post-vaccination gathering last night. guest tested positive morning. first time year we’ve hung together without wearing masks whole time (we outside though). Many us newly vaccinated I’m realllly hoping vaccines provided protection. Sounds pretty much useless. Results can't trusted

Every infection gets detected interrupted infection chain, they're gonna stop pandemic call useless. high hope. wish true. Excessive hygiene good, linked allergies autoimmune diseases. Also, wide use disinfectants causes spread resistant bacteria. I’m clinical trial brought period concerned man. Good news shows 90-95% efficacy vaccines used. might drop Next Gen COVID-19 vaccines come in. got “sick” shots, also covid February.. vaccine fever doesn’t come close hell went Feb. completely worth it, get vaccinated people Blyatiful. Honestly, better way make portion recalcitrant Americans want vaccine seize low-demand areas ship big cities abroad. Looks like Trump right again... Actual cases definitely numbers shown. 

But Delhi go 40k 275k recorded cases ffs, INDIA DID. 

That's huge difference.  Argentina's report actually confirms 91.4% efficacy vaccine. might special case met lots Americans Uni went teach English Prague, surrounded lots Americans. Also, wife American daughter too.

But American tourists generally good Scotland. I’ve found polite, curious, generous. There’s occasional boorish ones that’s often people business rather pleasure, treat visiting ancient city sad task rather adventure. course also occasional weird ones seem think they’re Scottish distant ancestral link, I’m actually fine it’s bit backstory appreciation country attempt ownership.

It’s also hilarious seeing Americans 20 pubs first time. often look shifty they’re used 21 legal unaccustomed law different. I'm teacher, right kind teacher, teach adults. vaccine Spain! Look chart India. case rate line shot basically straight flattened four months.

For example, Delhi, daily new cases gone 40,000 March 17th 275,000 April 17th. doubt would ever put liberal NDP party member charge though! Ford dumb shit support party. dog shit .  Scotland top list soon things normal out. havent 3 years. many friends need see. Enjoy tennants me.  Vaccines ""stop"" transmission, *slow down*. enough people vaccinated, case numbers drop, additional measures still make drop *faster* -- community spread whatever level ""acceptable,"" masks + vaccines save lives vaccines alone. community spread negligible, longer matters R=0.95 R=0.5 -- can't drop case numbers ~0 -- point still want use reasonable tools reduce R.

Mask mandates (outside restaurants bars) super cheap really restrict economic activity -- worst say they're little uncomfortable people throw whiny tantrums wearing them. makes sense keep even dropped other, much expensive measures reduce R. Covid England becomes like flu, italian media scaremongers people getting vaccines 70+ people refusing AZ we're 430 deaths per day. Great well reports originated Russia only. information coming Russia checked sources visible media event outside Russia president Argentina got C19 Sputnik dose. Wait get two rn Every college require else every college covid hot spot... Yes, protected. vaccine reduces risk (by LOT)

&amp;#x200B;

You still get likely ""just cold"" do. said ""can"" since vaccine 100%. Still behave. Dont tounge kiss stranger meet.

Imagine getting COVID coin toss. odds death move ""heads tails"" ""sideways"" China population size. richer still many poor people China. Advising. playing. 

Learn difference True, one points study makes people USE busses get there. Querdenker even coperations bus services. find scientific evidence protests actually contribute infection rates gladly read it. 6,000 breakthrough infections, 396 people hospitalized 74 people died, according CDC data released last week.

And article stated number underestimate. still, control overall infection rate unvaccinated local population groups per time period. it’s really under-underestimate. 

Of course it’s something, definitely right path, articles like help paint unrealistic figure feel ya, I'm obese too, keeping weight control throughout pandemic definitely challenge. 

I'm doctor, almost one else either, going get firm, verifiable answer. would say - else could hold going back normal? get vaccine already lowered risk much possible foreseeable future. you, fact similar (obese - I'm partially vaccinated Pfizer), would get back living now. toll mental health isolation probably greater cost miniscule risk dying covid vaccinated. Realistically life always risks identify risks reasonable not. Living life reasonable, minimal risk gotten vaccine.  article Europe Japanese people hating Olympics much already, Japanese gov prioritises vaccinate athletes medical workers/elderly people... well, people complain let LDP elected anyway?   curious, american ever sees hate us online: like american tourists? genuine question we’re somewhat like abroad outside memes   get antibody test came back positive, would miracle every single side effect second dose lol. say values however, positive. Biden needs close borders India ASAP, India variant dominant strain July.  Thank God UK government kept 100 cases already getting 1.5k people day India next week.... Oh wait Obesity (working it, lost weight pandemic even stress wanting binge eat everything sight lol still obese though unfortunately) Zero covid impossible bar goal. would know amount unless people test? solve shit, hoarded vaccine components produce doses Germans Brits developed  I’m surprised Biden hasn’t closed borders India yet bad things gotten. way high risk? Compromised immune system, obesity, smoker? feel like makes difference question. well said Happens accurate though....  read study (link) instead making baseless claims

This study kind insidious.

It looked two specific events, protesters transported buses demonstrations. measures increase cases areas buses came from.

So additional invections measured study probably happened hundreds people boxed thoses buses several hours demonstrations open air.  restrictions 

lol sub changed soooo much last 2 months, I'd say like half ""open EVERYTHING fuck all"" half ""what FUCK CLOSE EVERYTHING DOWN"" basically between, camps extremely loud angry  can't fix stupid 🤪  Try without using air con. never stop missing father, rage towards helped contribute death never fade.

You're thing. Canada's healthcare system 86th percentile. US' 81st. think that's ""terrible"", really know tell you. Lol reasonable people Florida? masks anywhere clubs full. Nothing actually changed Texas lifted mask mandate. Businesses still kept actual mask compliance levels stayed same. tears eyes reading ""Covids 1 18"". positive satirical, read realized he's done zero, zilch, research topic pontificates about.

My lord, maroon.  Yeah that’s super simple do. Let’s uproot everything another job house everything need completely different state need new pandemic. ""Great, agreed start Fauci divisive."" agreeing points, except extremely obviously viewed Fauci's comments commentary Trump's divisiveness, absolutely insistent point trolling Fauci divisive himself. never agreed Fauci divisive, rather separate point anyone divisive. 

You seem arguing point criticism divisiveness divisiveness, bad faith. boo. South Sudan government thinks vaccines expired.

But drugmaker thinks shelf life least six months more.

I agree, concise sentence driving today would make car crashes go away even faster.

If unlicensed driver, yes, need wait get license help make car crashes go away. actually license, already responsible driver helping car crashes go away getting license driving responsibly licensed people allowed drive.

The thing is, article licensed drivers, unlicensed ones, still afraid drive spite fact they're already part stop car crashes. responsibilities licensed drivers unlicensed drivers are, according actual science, *not equal* need stop pretending are. longer virus mutates around world, higher probability spawn variant circumvent pre-existing natural factors. goes vaccines, BTW.  Exactly. messaging far ""don't worry schools, kids basically never get COVID anyway, spread there"". seems like maybe entirely true... Managers premature Covid still kill second new variant appears people get sick ?  Remarkable objectively reasonable post downvoted.

The 500k+ people died COVID US can't un-die. all, happy well Canada pandemic. drama vaccines also *way* overblown considering one top countries size world 1st doses, daily doses, doses per 100 people. Anyone thinks we're badly simply paying attention. 

I'm also *very* happy US excelling vaccine distribution much. death rate, absolutely needed think plan focus vaccinating citizens made sense best plan preserve human life, regardless location. Seeing success make least bit upset framing frankly, mind kind gross.  impression Pfizer vaccine efficacy it, albeit reduced efficacy,""

The article makes sound like people contracted variant unvaccinated wonder think efficacy reduced. Appreciate feedback encouraged outcomes UK. 

My fear still fully addressed don’t know long protection last beyond 21-28 days first dose. hope best, don’t think politicians making non-evidence based decisions. UK sorta clinical trial extending dosage interval. I'm actually feeling better already, past 24 hour mark. I'm still leaving house anything, headache's gone think fever is, too. initial reaction something along lines ""they're likely older health problems make high risk, like they're going getting exposed.""

But great thing enough vaccine give shots people truly going spreading others begin with.

They still can't leave, since homebound pandemic started, people going able visit again. Family members, friends. Human connection. love see it. People eligible regardless gullible proposed adjustment needed. 

Unfortunately many gullible decide take vaccine believe lies misinformation. restrictions doesn’t mean people follow them, also counties/health departments outside big cities didn’t enforce restrictions past last fall. coming close family members live suburbia Dallas. thread Indian B.1.617 Variant 37th pretty awful given advanced US is. would take 30th 37th every day week.

You literally proved point. ur public health official ur word honesty matters. decided calculated lie encourage ppl wear masks case PPE shortage. Public health lying public means , job public health. Imagine u flight listened advice masks work?

Haha 😂  May quality life forever altered. I'm completely fine wishing bad things people. close quite enough, hopefully grave complications sooner later. Reddit Presents: 

The Republican Celebrity star Lineup!  Exactly this. People desperate hear hard date hard number vaccinations, reality work like this, would pretty irresponsible Fauci say suggest otherwise. Coincidentally, ever thought real musical artist. hermits covid, surprise surprise, hermits covid. like part in-between coughing spitting he's talking campfire playing ""firebreathing"" version Star Spangled Banner. probably lot people that.

Ted wondering aloud ""what good knowing"" Covid. good knowing mostly know thoroughly self isolate avoid sickening others.  misremembering, original run Rosanne also use progressive themes often? many stories people don’t understand covid/ think it’s lie getting tested? think it’s fake, wouldn’t test equally fake?  edgy actually predator child rapist? try criticising Harris something actually say, turn around thing accused of?

Stand vein standing health officials. Supporting people right includes taking people wrong. Yeah, remembered wrong. mention drugs, drank beer ate bunch junk food.  one hand, Russia certainly scientists good enough make effective vaccine.

Yes, although fearmongers tell new strains, antibodies last 8-9 months. Cell immunity last years. really puzzle we're treating like first virus ever plague humanity.

If getting covid provide immunity, seeing reinfection cases over, that's simply Right even Fauci confirming believed safe quite effective. guess trusted Russian data. change language would make difference people know get it. right center politically, one truly believes Bill Gates trying kill us vaccines. others relatives older high risk; bs read social media hear church, read shared email chain messages etc drowned actual message scientists.  mom (former nurse) high risk 77, brother works ICU told like watch people vents dying covid--nope, matter.

He tested positive Covid early December.  Current CDC guidance (and least month two) everyone get vaccine soon available Covid wait till mandatory isolation period (I think it’s something like ten days symptom onset days last symptoms dissipate). recommendation delay treated therapeutic antibodies (monoclonal).

Ha anti-union? seem anti-union. definitely anti-exclusion, critical unions put artificial barriers harm workers. He's critical (a) unions refuse membership unless already working union job (b) unions refuse let members work non-union jobs. 

I follow enough claim heard/read everything he's put there, seen never really paints anti-union, anti-anti-worker policies unions. Which, policies are. prioritize union workers. Can't find union job bad market? Starve taking non-union job. needs moved r/hittablefaces  Talking it, course. blasé another thing. person I've known passed natural devastating. minimize unnatural.  Good luck teddy Well, made couple decent songs upon time. Probably every drug known man invented blow brain cells. scary kind gun nut, defends dipshits, says racist shit.

Let pedo get deserves. Nugent piece shit I'm ashamed state him. 1 hit wonder ass. Remember reality TV show hit contestant truck got cancelled? Ted Nugent saying, surreal. Like still don’t believe covid feel it. Damn y'all really cool wishing death people. you. That's raised.

He's evil human being. world would much better place gone. rhetoric alone probably helped kill extra thousands. 7-10 days turn happens hush needle gauge ultra thin like dick hair volume, even feel going in.  I'm American guest time being, country yet, tell people share sentiment. People want vaccine pissed taking long get (me included), people think virus hoax hate government ""limiting freedoms."" There's also election coming later year, highly politicized. government loosened restrictions every major holiday there's spike cases every time. High quality masks (not surgical cloth) required public transportation stores, never enforced. 

To get vaccine must sent invitation, based age pre-existing conditions. can't sign appointment online without invitation. reported today vaccination sites Berlin tossed thousands vaccine doses enough people administer to. kind shit show vaccination rules strict. need stay we've hit herd immunity.

Don't stop taking antibiotics feel better.  Coroner said really really hard pinpoint vaccine cause death. clear case given vaccine people go anaphylactic shock. kinda problem. People take vaccine die medical examiners shoulders shrugs. okay believe everything read internet think wise doubt. Take care.  Okay ass sneezing really see doctor :P people staying home they're sick

God, hope becomes thing U.S.

Or whatever, learned anything 2020, I'm accepting non-WFH job ever again.

I burned 500 hours life sitting traffic 2019. Never again! They're longer trusting science. shame. Dude don’t listen empty Axios article Article sources Osterholm. That’s need know. wonder still thinks America see biggest wave mid March?

Has anyone asked that, way? Like, asked got wrong would reevaluate opinions future doesn’t continue make mistakes?

I really think take accountability public. Like, never discusses extreme scary predictions never come true. He’s front cameras 24/7, anyone asked he’s bad this? \*sad canadian noises\* It’s hard tell people meeting going hasn’t scheduled yet. would assume need give scientists time review data coordinate date works setting date. credit credit due, pretty much stole snl, hence quotes: can't call informed opinion speculate lack natural immunity due tight restrictions without early large outbreak. That's uneducated guess. knew December. understand ""need"" stop wearing masks.

It's fucking hayfever season.

You pry mask bloated, snot-covered nose, use crowbar, even easier time I'm already dead.

Aside that, masks keep face warm, nice go outdoor walk work.  Guess chose live free (of covid-19). Glam Shatterskull? Hence comment proves data . Worldwide mind insufficient based many not, getting tested. coworkers mum passed within 10 days loving person drove 74 ur ass dr. Appointment.

Grateful vaccines board. 24 hrs yuck yet worth it.  think Americans need empathy understanding world wide issue. People dying, life effected. boy abroad Spain shut down. Grateful home. Yet sad abroad students missed out.  Lost dollars. grateful hospitalization traveling Madrid , Dallas precautions last March 14. 
Get vaccinated people. Please! could get worse variants. right likes like mentally refer ""all lives matter"" rap, stuff like Tom McDonald. said anything killing them? They're simply hoping hatred stupidity causes demise stop spreading hatred bigotry. like Rush Limbaugh dying lung cancer downplaying effects smoking trying look cool sucking cigars years: happened deserving guy 100% brought himself.

I mean get point reminds [this norm Macdonald same, idea eerily similar. observation. First thing he's caught 18 vaccinated population tends older less healthy, groups earlier access vaccines. I’m sure controlled groups contracting it, you’d find vaccinated better outcomes Sure, take line thinking anywhere though.

My concern push vaccine hesitant away feeling vaccine safe eventually getting it. F’en douchebag.... know give shit either way? virus. protesting dangerous virus standpoint, cause ""actual social issue"" matter. dangerous, matter justified (or justified) cause is, big deal either way. Kevin James Save argument someone deserving. really get negativity. US hit pandemic significantly harder were, fact they're vaccinating quickly good news. able fully enter third wave we'd likely seen tens hundreds thousands deaths. They've posted quite times, Israeli study CDC released studies well. link CDC showed following second dose vaccine (the recommended number doses), risk infection reduced 90 percent two weeks vaccination. study demonstrates two mRNA vaccines reduce risk SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic There’s couple hot spots hopefully leveling now. Ted always thought smarter better anyone. big mouth d-bag. music cool Eddie Van Halen would kick ass guitar. Ted needs shut up, go away keep opinions himself.   True, use data available. I'd like think US would lookout issues early stage given aware AZ issue J&amp;J approved.

Also, US 2 deaths CVST following Pfizer vaccine? rest world none, thus would imagine US looking along. Play cards right I’ll ;) drummer rolling stones also marry underage girl?

For confused looking information, *bassist* drummer, [they waited 18 get married... ""seeing other"" 4 years prior True: wealthy begin, we'd placed enough orders ourselves

The EU placed enough orders variety vaccines still ended short due failed candidates (Sanofi), delays (Curevac) production fuckups (AstraZeneca), that's magic bullet either. still ~50% doses produced EU exported, buyers well less wealthy countries via Covax.

Getting many vulnerable groups vaccinated worldwide - understand - best way fighting global pandemic. hand argue primary role state protect citizens, short term would definitely mean use production domestically could self-serving share, high return cost diplomatically, States could find way within terms laws contracts.

They could stroke pen. that's beat virus. saw war. minor inconvenience Maybe instead cherry-picking one specific study support point, look dozens studies shown outdoor transmission negligible, well statements CDC effect.  finally got stranglehold far. Think much longer COVID -19 deal old ass. learned word today upset anti vaxxers would proven right than, ya know, kids actually adverse effects? Wait... Tom talked someone himself?? afterwards

He's 72 seems bad. might *be* ""afterwards"". vaccination significantly reduce ability spread COVID, want myself, would get it?

If vaccination significantly reduce ability spread COVID, get goddamn life back minute goes full effect. price; get vaccine minute state government declares fully vaccinated people longer restrictions. means lockdowns, curfews, masks, capacity limits. Nothing.  Cool. certainly changed behavior since vaccinated.

me too. went movie, two bars. still masked socially distanced. really going wish death anyone else, thought, death due covid resulted 1-1000 people skeptical vaccine ultimately get vaccinated...would death, (while tragedy some) best resolution world? stupid qualifier front word eradicate. world feel exterminator pretty much eradicated bedbug infestation?  vaccine, acceptable mortality levels common cold, something like 10 deaths per million per year.

Anyway, trying say Nugent never sounded like anything drunken dad jam me. I'm talking plays stage, studio recordings. Oh well...  He's not. 

Like I'm huge guitar music, rock n roll, heavy metal fan; even think he's creepy, racist shithead.

Did get symptoms side effects? Herd immunity doesn’t exist without vaccine period. New viruses don’t disappear infect enough people, become endemic. 

Measles provides near perfect lifetime immunity infection never able develop functional immune escape mutants, yet virus existed hundreds thousands years. Countries can’t afford vaccinate enough citizens don’t herd immunity natural infections. Instead everyone gets measles point usually kid. “natural herd immunity” measles isn’t possible reason believe would virus. 

Of course endemic diseases don’t lead nearly many infections much strain hospitals pandemic ones. way actual herd immunity occur immunize unnaturally large number people vaccines. understand this. Numbers many places last summer. time told important cautious. similar numbers it’s practically described mental illness cautious? agree vaccines changing things, seems entirely reasonable households unvaccinated people still cautious right now. really depends experiment setup though. Many looking consistency ratings wines upper shelf.

To quote article ""Chance great deal awards wines win."" 

That means comparing wines competing awards. doubt many cheaper ones entered contests...

The article does, however, mention [this look wines wide range prices. find data also indicates experts, unlike non-experts, average assign high –  higher – ratings  expensive wines.  coefficient  expert\*price interaction term positive highly statistically significant. Hopefully soon commenter correct. Covid typically bad experience second dose. ask Russian think US behaves. surprised, much same.

Also still new risk. cars exist suddenly appeared became widespread one year ago, think would reasonable expect many people would want take risk driving.

2. pushy, casual - offer information, argue
3. Describe experience vaccine made feel better going more
4. Discuss environment people who've vax share experience (this normalizes vaccine)
5. also jokingly promised we'll take trip gets vax, I'll definitely take it
6. Again, pushy make conversation vaccines, find common ground

I disagree lot stuff, arguing pushing stuff never worked. thing remember conversation, debate.

Don’t get wrong, I’m pro-vaccine — I’m currently shot one Pfizer already CDC “vaccine passport” documenting yellow fever vaccination required enter various countries Africa, amongst whole handful vaccines. saying “yet see downside” bit dishonest. Downsides exist, like pretty much everything life, they’re wayyyyyyy outweighed positives.  Even - much virus spread aboard? thought planes supposed super safe? terms pricing based estimated liability costs country given vaccine liability provisions. U.S. indemnified producers cheaper vaccines. they're exported countries that, producers effectively could take loss sales would sold cost. meant proof vaccination. agree. asked beginning April changes policy. Yeah try Google Ah, real pandemic.

Copious studies released showing negligible outdoor transmission is. There's almost always least one front page subreddit. hard believe trolling really trying pretend case.
2. difference US massive deaths came ready means (vaccination). Since vaccination become available, death numbers consistently dropped, Germany's gone up, undoubtedly due horrible vaccination progress. 
3. Yes, European Commission part German government, completely dishonest pretend Germany large amount political influence within it; well within power German government to, stop, least call question EU's poor decisions. also arguments could made EU prepared handle COVID, Germany partly blame this. UK seems much smarter left.
4. true many European countries harsher restrictions various points. Germany seems taken path worst worlds: harsh enough restrictions interfere people's quality life without smart enough restrictions actually slow rapid spread virus. Also, one thing restrictions place temporary emergency measures due unprecedented thread. another matter entirely leave place indefinitely, well year crisis. possible Germany would longer need restrictions made smarter decisions regarding vaccination, precisely find government's current actions reprehensible: *their fault* cases control, yet want get people shoulder blame instead. really quite disgusting.
5. German citizen obviously vote elections. agree people want take away rights refugees crazy threats human rights. you, supports banning peaceful protests, much threat human rights. try give false equivalency ""the law says fine."" country passes law flagrantly violates human rights, suddenly non-issue law says ok. fact, even greater concern limitation rights legislative backing.

Then stopped AZ completely. Also there's ""solidarity"" sharing first 10M extra BNT, 50M earlier Q2 shared pro-rata. differences orders big anymore. I'm going back office work, better, comfortable, cheaper, less time thing home. mean vaccines reach herd immunity 4-6 months. Naturally (if vaccines didn’t exist) ever happen it’ll multi year process that’s ISR (infected/ious, susceptible, recovered) ratios Covid don’t prove problematic thought. Isn’t entire point keep health anonymous? whole team knew got vaccine use vaccine charge code. don’t get downvoted haha. said get 70-75% vaccinated get back normal

Uptake reach far 70% children included. mandatory order attend school.

But anyways, everyone wants vaccine gets everything return normal. turns amount stupid people higher thought, get naturally infected herd immunity kick then. said 70% vaccinated *or* recovered. I'm shocked since minks carriers COVID, otters family. target Breton talking fully vaccinated, yes. July see far 100M doses delivered anything fully vaccinated end June within weeks July. 

Here Netherlands aim give everyone first shot beginning July, claim limiting J&amp;J cause 6 weeks delay.  Also living rural areas end getting hospitalized almost assuredly get transferred advanced hospital suburban/urban hospitals conditions worsen. Huh til. suppose get everyone wants vaccine open season waiting. go Pfizer Moderna? sure downvoted. remember studies also. remember CDC flip-flopped issue well 2020.  public, keep hand sanitizer purse use I've touched things public people also touched. home, still wipe groceries wash hands sorting mail.  think I'll stop yet.  feels, me, like initial message former Surgeon General sent people buy masks effective, later, apologize say masks really effective, wanted enough masks healthcare workers needed most. sounds like thing. Clorox said production facilities top speed, yet stores restocked yet.  
 Hospitals naturally need products, President wants reopen schools make sure they're safe students needing 3 feet apart instead 6 feet due lack space school rooms. predict future, we'll hear wiping things really issue, able accumulate enough supply healthcare education industries time.  Maybe I'm wrong. feels like following pattern. ounce evidence says would absolutely safe environment someone vaccinated.

How so? 90%-95% effective serious symptoms means 1 10 20 people still get serious symptoms COVID. Lots offices 20 people. 

People always seem forget important way vaccines protect people reducing spread virus, meaning even 1- 10, protected coming contact it. person described scenario good change long exposure whatever worth, assuming drive, risk dying infection get work vaccinated far, far lower risk dying drive work.

I'm always amazed analogy take sorts precautions lessen danger driving. licensing, testing, seat belts, air bags, speed bumps, stop lights, stop signs, DUI laws, insurance points, eye tests, speed limits, safety engineering, safety recalls, speed limits, road engineering, on.

Perhaps could simply ignored 'whattaboutism' comment, instead. Perhaps better comparison would percent positive vaccinated vs unvaccinated time period. think need world wide fight obesity. Maybe hold food companies accountable creating marketing extremely unhealthy foods misleading marketing foods. others point hard, data COVID-19 information lags days. Testing, vaccinations cases lag. prior day could several days. That's one reason look one days totals state nation. do, look overall picture. full snapshot. hard track active cases.

That said two web sites like free. One usafacts (which tracks information US information). Also World Data well, great job too. look vaccine rates. CDC might bet though part look county US see stand variety metrics. 

The two things USA facts world data that, interesting world data seems show higher vaccination rates per state what's officially reported information usafacts seems lag several days more. sure get data. funeral pyres worry you, try make telehealth appointment good therapist ASAP

your mental health important employers (especially at-will states) start applying strong pressure employees get vaccinated, imagine hesitancy drop like rock.

Just anecdote U.S. employers right now, mom, RN major urban medical center, ""attended"" mandatory computer-based training recently began asking ""Are vaccinated?"" Answering ""yes"" instantly ended training module, allowing get back work. (Incidentally, got first dose within week two initial EUA Pfizer.) Answering ""no"" would've initiated remainder module.

Evidently, due staffing issues (a surprising number healthcare workers vax-hesitant U.S.), employer yet able mandate vaccination employees. Since vaccinations available adults, believe hesitant ones borrowed time, given strong enough liability protections employers.

Got it, thought proof person saying ""two weeks"" variant protection seen nothing supports read pretty obsessively. think simplistic chalk ""politics"". know hundreds people point unwilling get vaccinated seem really lean one way terms Conservative Liberal. Maybe slightly Conservative. lot straight fear they'll use whatever excuse lean on. know local hospital wife works trying reach African American community resistant taking vaccine almost guarantee Conservative. also know several Liberals anti-vax constantly tout stupid essential oils cure everything natural remedy everything refusing get vaccinated well. obviously know several Conservatives convinced entire pandemic overreaction. 

I'm sure answer honestly. think people straight afraid put something body think tested enough. best explain upside getting vaccinated use. make sure I'm vaccinated I'm taking proper precautions family's safety. reminds people dealt bed bugs. lot trouble readjusting they're gone, let alone letting guard down, even low risk activities. correct. invited re-tested stay home symptoms otherwise cannot self isolate got notified. got J&amp;J feel body pains! lower back/hips worst. pain suddenly disappeared 24 hours shot though, hope too! strange, state in?

Okay then, wise guy, point think restrictions come complete end? say oh PLEASE let die out. Let's never see again. Let's come terms fact weaponized virus accidently escaped. happening folks dont lie yourselves, every major country it. Dont blame China.  didnt stop inventing new ways kill everyone nuclear weapons. think otherwise gullible, naïve dangerous. must hold government representatives accountable keep us safe real threats. inventing new threats attack counter.  
Ferrets Hepa filters strapped backs running wild, something figuring ways hurt people. shit fall far asshole. Upvoted appears interesting *and* correct. Thank r/among_apes No, means whatever chance getting before, 80% less. chance far less 100% before, far less 20% vaccine 80% efficacy. Bird 🐦 exactly point. tends theme within crowd. Yeah, clarify another comment. I'll add edit. probably used first example, trying convey doctors stated body process medications vaccinations well. appear COVID vaccine exception here. Right, larger sample means get kinds situations. won’t 100% efficacy preventing deaths practice, right? 100% value applicable trials, real world roll-out. take Russian Chinese vaccine even claimed 100 % efficacy. long haired free thinking fairly liberal kid...I loved music wild persona Conservatives hated music.

Now...as middle aged center left responsible adult cant listen music loath man politics, daft dodging, history poacher history going age girls but...Conservatives sure seem like him. think everyone wondering is, shit himself?  well, demographics ""vaccinated people US"" match demographic ""people US""

vaccinations past weeks heavily skewed towards people much likely severe symptoms and/or die got covid, think meaningfully compare two numbers.  case fatality rate currently 2%. perfect measure, [this site good job explaining 1 500 people hospitalized this, overwhelms healthcare capacity several times disease becomes even deadly.

And talking fatalities. plenty people going long term effects lives.

Covid Ebola, still well within *shut everything down* territory. half-assed shutdown could potentially let month. instead right month month outbreaks, we've half-assed year.

Whether given damn spread impact limited *are* isolating taking precautions. trying think Covid pun last hit song, memories 40 years ago kind hazy.  Yeah Cat Scratch Fever pretty awesome song maybe just, uhhh, balances everything out.  quarter people refuse vaccine, think acceptable line seasonal flu deaths. Ego like fucking rock star read DR day cancelling J&amp;J would set back three weeks only. that’s top already cancelling AZ. probably used first example, trying convey doctors stated body process medications vaccinations well. appear COVID vaccine exception here. Multiply least 2. Haha. Fuck Ted Nugent. COVID-19 spreads easier STDs due airborne spread pf SARS-CoV-2 viruses. dating means close enough spread it. neither god He's gonna dig heels even further. ""See? fine now"" downplay sick was.   think main takeaway article testing, tracing isolating going even common track prevalence development variants. Looking plans several governments, definitely seems they're planning on.

I hard doubts evolve effective way this. controversy outrage ""privacy"" ""tracking"" etc.. likelihood mass-amounts public citizens voluntarily ""opt-in tracked"",etc.. laughable. 

That's especially true US.. we've pretty much given ""people taking sensible precautions"" moved ""vaccinate many people possible"" (which problems since large percentage people refusing vaccinated).. think recently hit 50% population least 1 shot. even get ""herd immunity"" ?. .I serious doubts. (at least vaccination) 

Sadly.. think ""long tail"" Covid19 working way population either killing (or causing long term health effects).. probably still likely outcome. assumptions flawed, even though may explicitly thrown date, touting something unachievable near term basis.

There way vaccine uptake exceed 70%, even kids. Seniors achieving uptake near 80% considered ceiling. think uptake among children probably less 50% believe wait full approval anyway. would mean maybe vaccinating August adolescents much later younger kids. 

Assuming world vaccinated puts 2024 according experts, ask again: near term policies would happy with? 50% population say restrictions high. defense heard early statements masks saw hoarding happening grocery stores afraid suggested masks would see hoarding well.

In words, totally willing lie manipulate people's behavior. good want us trust based trials conducted Moscow ... they're selling vaccine surely soon enough someone outside Russia able confirm everything. Sounds like great doctor me. COVID deniers vaccine refusers don’t deserve treatment.  Cowardly perv mad catch COVID-17 point US citizens never truly safe unless Global Pandemic resolved. Currently double mutant strain ravaging across India due govt's incompetence sheer lack preparations. infectious lethal previous strain. strain kicked curb, eventually make way countries also America start spreading well. Maybe now, 6 months time.

This 'vaccinate citizens, fuck world' short term thinking would understandable US running short raw materials vaccines. US short anything. India massively running short. Perfect Peggy,""KEEP PERFECTLY SITTING TILL ALLOW FREEDOM!!!""

/s ya'll know sons really shitty rapper? wanna cringe orbit google shit. sheeples lead slaughterhouse!  It’s really disgusting people sit back, judge act like COVID isn’t big deal. act like everyone wears masks, socially distances wants vaccine blown proportion reaction “flu”.

I’m healthy 35 year old male. get 2nd dose Moderna today. parents refuse get vaccine. sister can’t even troubled wear mask around 91 year old grandpa obviously vaccine well.

I honestly don’t think look this. know Mom would likely die Covid-19 health issues - she’s scared vaccine. It’s extremely frustrating. Nothing change stubborn old ladies mind. get points changing sheets deliberately shitting bed. There's reason case count anywhere near high first place. Underrated comment lol  ‘Ok guys swear it’s real now!’ hoped thing would happen Trump contracted laugh naive enough even consider possible outcome. Nothing change. guys psychopath one really tracks active cases accuracy. rough approximation might looking cases two three weeks. Agreed. 95% damn good. asymptomatic. doctor ordered guess... stopped administering dozes back. Since (or close to) extra cases shown up. Sure, probably holes data, like would start lookout today. sure EU countries Denmark said cancelling J&amp;J together (we’ve already cancelled AZ together) would delay us approx. three weeks trust russian press anything. Mask burning/bye bye Zoom bashes happen imo. Legalize ranch Would kids able go cinema vaccinated? wish moron died got Chinese anti-racist

They don’t go together, sir. It’s like someone advocating driving blindfolded getting hit car. may make good person celebrate it, it’s small piece justice. 

I lost mom (medical worker) grandpa (old guy) Covid, I’ve certainly dark moments wanted take active action people ignorant. Like understand logic theory, still need take measures protect workers. think Bill Maher said best. One group pretended like nothing side pretend like World War Z. mentality sunk sunk hard difficult give up. lot elements truth it. still get sick get others sick, unlikely possible. reasonable people understand willing give last year identifying group took way seriously. making stuff up, uninformed. want talk cultural impact now, something else. Technical skill? Let's put way. could play Nugent's stuff one solid year instrument. great, high level technical sense I'm interested antibody sinovac affect JnJ vaccine. 

I offered sinovac last February intended recipient take it. decline since brands expected arrived.  March came went vaccines still procurement phase.

Yesterday offered opportunity different source. Real quick question... this? Wtf read. Congrats making feel nauseous. 

If dude dies don’t think world lose anything valuable. He’s got shitty Dr. then- multiple known treatments Covid show good results relieving symptoms shortening duration. Yawn.. thought looong time. 

But experience watching charismatic personalities repeated self-caused brushes death massive consequences change nothing. I've watched communities charismatic leaders dissolve de-radicalize die / banned.

I changed mind. Fuck Ted Nugent. Don’t confuse headline relevance.  Yep. bad. would never wish anybody die COVID.

Never.

Feels like another trump. Yeah, think know this. Catching virus doesn’t make deadly, harmful pandemic.

Let’s get shit straight.

1. Covid 19 99.9% survival rate.
2. Vaccines 90% effective 
3. States lock downs mask mandates performing better strictest states. chance hell knowledge, yet data AZ's efficacy vs hospitalizations deaths SA variant. [This found severely reduced AZ efficacy (\~12%) vs symptomatic disease caused B.1.351, large enough measure efficacy hospitalization death. see two weeks mentioned all, discussion variant protection. Earloops fine. could solve obesity crisis letting government dictate diets.

This would probably saved lives COVID restriction don’t honestly believe you? Oxygen levels aren’t lower wearing mask? People passing wear mask tight. hope stays long time Toss everything bucket soap capful bleach, rinse, air-dry. Takes 5 minutes. Third G20 pretty good considering people consider Canada third important country G20. argument possibly people suppressed immune systems allow COVID go cycles high low levels body insufficiently clears first infection. wax wane virus lead variants within individual, notably Israel size Vancouver island. Whole lot easier get needles arms one spot Good you!

Needles bother me, course one thinks they're fun. absolutely surprised literally feel thing injection. looking forward, felt dull ache area later, wondering they'd slapped bandaid sent way without actual shot. Definitely people truck nuts. truck gets nuts penis. annoying me? everything annoys everyone (yourself included I'm sure) personally impact them. sub going like that.

What sub going like removing restrictions, lmao. Went NY hours day. lotta people wearing masks lot people wearing masks. Indoors, though, everyone employer 25 employees, show law give sick days back Saskatchewan 33% least one shot. 48 older walk drive in, first responders healthcare workers age already vaccinated.

Ontario's failure whole country's. media using pictures crowded outdoor spaces since beginning pandemic demonise young people, never lead explosion new cases. They've done headlines over. surprising part people still listen tabloids stuff. 31 I’ll take soon let it. importantly, what's vaccination level? Come Boston, man. depends whether they've vaccinated not. everyone vaccinated chances anybody catching anything extremely unlikely.

If people vaccinated, there's still much lower chance getting it, there's still possibility. I'd wear mask people group vaccinated. reason risk nearly clear. I’m place Florida didn’t require insurance ID, need fill form get vaccine. think lot mass vaccine sites Florida operating way. Florida great place half people aren’t Florida residents (they snowbirds), think stopped asking ID partially due that. think DC still one? Maybe?

I think states one ""you must wear mask can't distance"", DC definitely went route ""masks time outside"".  people downvoting you? going study states likely able vaccine home, legitimate concern probably many others.

Reddit weird sometimes “It completely unethical high-income countries vaccinating young healthy people happens expense people risk groups front lines low- middle-income countries,” said Thunberg, invited guest briefing.

Ah, bringing child preach mantra they've trying push. Thanks thanks. wisdom comment underappreciated. I'm vaccinated matter. pretty much entirely relegated shitty social media comments. There's public anti-vax movement weight behind it. Yeah, took aspirin morning dose 2 wore afternoon got pretty feverish unwell, better took kicked in.

I'm hearing really mixed information taking NSAIDS potential effects vaccine's efficacy now, hopefully mess anything up. :c Ngl mass availability I'd get second set that.

And third fourth... Especially considering they're middle high schools. 3 weeks. supposed get 2nd dose tomorrow got pushed back  eligible vaccines live there. resident country take care them. Would fly back 'murica dental work haemorrhoid removal? Got link? Somethings itching back head since I’ve read types articles. exactly explanation this? deadlier young adults? symptoms worse? young people dying? so, ages? Im confused. media misinterpreting twisting statistics. 

The efficacy vaccine stated lower variants, that's measured disease prevention. vaccine still effective preventing hospitalizations deaths variants. clueless then. Remember claimed household contact could transmit aids? don’t understand people worship him. picture hanging Tell Spring Break partiers might actually make difference... Good point. 

Now there’s new team would great better clarity expect regards opening next months. 

I’ve seen great ideas thread % adults vaccinated specific number case counts. 

I think needs approach emphasizes normality getting vaccine. Focusing number related vaccine percentages might encourage otherwise would get vaccine, go ahead get vaccine. think early scheduling issues turned LOT people off. sense planning getting it, decided could wait ""until kinks worked out"". I've scheduled mine, siblings, SO, SO's brother parents, parents, two friends' appts. One friend's parents actually asked could help find appts children ha! Common theme group getting frustrated tech think they'd able get through. think chances mask requirement actually goes? Yeah, think thing one official capacity (in case Fauci) willing say actually want see, pretty easy believe know, either. mean that's reality, know say loud? That's spite hot weather mitigating factor. end day, virus highly contagious heavily dense cities India perfect spread. cities located colder climates, would even worse. Notice southern US remarkably better northern US despite dramatically less restrictions businesses social gatherings, limited mask mandates, significantly lower vaccine rates. cant help assume climate related. Summer heat humidity stop spread, clearly mitigating factor. well, orange tier counties, vast majority counties, allowed 50% capacity indoor events, course theres june 15th date Sorry, couldn’t wrong. doubt density impact, mitigable. Government response, public participation, clearly appears far driver outbreak intensity. I’m New Brunswick. Let’s compare North Dakota. Much way similarity - national border three state/provincial borders contend with, population 770,000 people. However, New Brunswick smaller North Dakota, NB triple population density. right, North Dakota far lass covid problem New Brunswick. Instead, vastly different covid situations opposite direction - North Dakota 106,000 cases 1510 deaths, New Brunswick 1800 cases 33 deaths. Government response really factor stands different. North Dakota governor easily negligent Ford. People tend bandy ‘low density’ ‘island’ excuses Atlantic Canada simply explain away completely needless failure jurisdiction. feel bad people suffering, overworked health care professionals trying hard get folks mess. end way Ontario. fair enough, lets wait 5 months decide don’t wear mask mean  almost like vaccines could far outweigh risks countries **worse** covid outbreak, something would also immediately change scene even countries currently suspended happened. difficult thought, know. plenty availability provinces hospital network. problem many hospitals 7+ hours away car. province starting leverage beds via helicopter. need help ground metro areas still though.  nuts.

But yes, whole, pretty restrictions here. states more-so others. Texas one states less restrictions (thankfully). 40 percent least one shot average places around 30 percent still ways go. way mean anyone without noticeable side effects already COVID.

It's also doable. Israel close. Japan multiple times (same S. Korea, obviously true Australia). exactly fool proof since many places level outbreak. Seattle. Even empty streets early morning.  know shift US attitudes COVID pretty interesting. friends NYC Miami partying like 1999 lol. Saturday friend literally going party 40 people invited kinda shocked (and jealous) considering still heavily restricted.

Life *somewhat* back normal USA, UK sloooooowly getting there, glacial pace per apathetic British attitudes.

“Everyone wear mask”

“Wipe surfaces transmission mainly via droplets sneezes cough”

“There’s evidence airborne transmission”

I've done everything asked last 14 months. EVERYTHING. second dose appointment tomorrow. two weeks time, I'm done. time test positive covid. Dodged whole year... am. We're still learning. Early indicators Israel say unlikely. there's many factors disease effects population seems highly contextual. Cases still *rising* many parts US despite vaccine rolling out, say behooves us assume can't early evidence might indicate otherwise. got mine waiting 15 minutes post shot leave  Monmouth University took poll (known polls). 5% Democrats unlikely ever vaccinated covid compared 43% Republicans. hour time entered parking lot mass vaccination site time left it.

Also four months far long imo, I'm sure would lower vaccine efficacy can't see helping. universities Ireland planning far know focus rapid testing away social distancing. I'm sure they'd get rid masks then, students would getting second dose September, we'll heading winter point we've always taken extremely cautious approach. 

But use logic US, imagine social distancing, capacity limits masks, constant rapid testing. know, crazy read people think conspiracy government *wants* keep people ""locked down"" ruin economy. purpose serve? talk ""new powers"" government want give up. new powers? Responding public health crisis asking (and really even enforcing) people wear masks? Really, that's hill people want die on? vaccines available everyone, staters honestly eligible every where. 

Get vax vacation need to, cares. Lockdowns absolutely work need done right. odd outright suspicious UK went months zero clotting cases 5 30 short period euros discovered possible link! 100% agreed! lockdown first started me, could think wonderful places want travel things back normal.

Now things mostly normal, want meet friends/family go drink grab food. Glad hear mindset shifting there.

Even though basically restrictions Texas, I'd still say people 'on edge' maybe week ago. weather getting better, people getting vaccinated, feeling like normal again. Hopefully get enjoy city couple months things continue open up! seems like pipe dream Illinois. got second Pfizer shot 4 hours ago. far feel nothing drained ridiculous needle anxiety. first shot gave sore arm got really tired 2 days later. Hope that's also case time! People keep telling I'm going want die tomorrow. least one question call sick ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ SHOTZ, SHOTZ, SHOTZ me? encapsulated thinking PERFECTLY. Add fact young child can't get vaccinated time soon wife tends struggle even bad cold, see reason jump back we're still seeing vaccine effects population large. state currently sits 13.6% positivity rate; I'd like see rate come tear mask. vaccine *may* protect me, community spread reduced significantly, protection means much more.

One thing though, regards vaccine: vaccine prohibits death/hospitalization COVID

This true, though. we've already seen breakthrough cases people get severely ill, hospitalized, and/or died. even begun see vaccinated people get ""long COVID"", bet absolutely also get severe cases. Yes, large percentage (and expected), notion vaccine send hospital simply case. again, community spread still high, leaving door open part small percentage.

Also, think 24 hours shit felt bad it’s year since I’ve sick lockdowns I’m used dealing stuff anymore. gotten side effects normal times, would’ve operating probably 80%. year good health practically glued bed whole day. There's need rude. No, difficult thought, entirely irrelevant. 7 billion people need vaccinating one way another. sending AZ/J&amp;J doses another country shifting blood clot deaths over. numbers die covid vaccine either way.

If 1,000 people die covid 10 vaccine country A, 100,000 die covid 10 vaccine country B, country deciding pass vaccine results country 0 vaccine deaths country B 20. done saved 10 lives killing another 10 B. 

Country effectively taken safer vaccines would eventually gone country B themselves. doses of, say Pfizer, country would never needed already vaccinated vaccines would gone country B. Right, disingenuous win argument misrepresenting certain demographic disproportionately impacted illness totally board. bet think African Americans likely heart disease color skin too, you? 90 days probably already protected let others get vaccine ahead you. reason delay COVID symptoms confused vaccine side effects. There's safety efficacy concern. We'll send fully armed battalion remind love. Definitely plan day off. 

My husband body aches, headache, chills, generally felt awful. 

I felt like I’d gotten shot. fact, second easier first! Finally. took long enough. press also desperate get commuters back buy papers, anywhere near irresponsible would otherwise expected That’s exactly reaction people like goodvibes want. They’re trying draw us ibto endless JAQ-ing conspiracy theorizing etc. ... need stop legitimatizing them. reasons easy find, let get sick. 23 seasons, two sure happening. 30 hours days obviously possible. 30 hours *after dose* seems wildly unlikely, although cases people sleeping longer that. weren’t difficult actually get. I’m 19 it’s impossible get vaccine right many ahead line. family also fearful vaccine means I’ll figure plan secretively wait bit longer it’s accessible. UK using Astrazeneca vaccines? SF joining within week. Many bay counties soon too. Dominoes falling Yea got 2nd Moderna dose yesterday I'm currently blasted bed. Rough, feverish night usually say man glad live CT sometimes. CT one better states getting folks shots, think another month rate we've going give us plenty time place lift restrictions without anyone seriously able argue ""too soon"", although I'm sure folks try say is. Bars great. missing much.

^^^Just ^^^kidding ^^^I ^^^want ^^^to ^^^go ^^^back ^^^to ^^^bars ^^^so ^^^bad ^^^😭 maybe use word jab... Can't say personally love Obama know older black folks do, hope decide listen one. hard trying convince old black people science always bad. course reasons, want community safe know? hope parents see one looked doesn’t sound possible, apparently Better people seem think. fact states dropped mask requirements seen big surges going empower others.

Whether businesses drop mask requirements whole question.  hope get vaccinated Christmas honest. Western Europe failed miserably shocking. dont know Anglo- Saxons great job again. Gotta give Fauci needs stop pretending understand political climate America. top public health messenger, incumbent upon understand respond situation presented adjust accordingly. smart genuinely surprised political culture, feigned surprise disingenuous unproductive. references demonstrate this? doubting would like able official source it! eight days vaccinate all, current rate. Oh wear mask, liberty attack. Could provide source? seem like statement anyone make.  VacciNation unite! Except invoked defense production act, helped significantly. It’s reason able get vaccine April instead June. article place. writer clearly decide supposed fearmongering cautious, paragraph comes different hits stats nothing previous paragraph next.

Also, really saying ""young people"" cutoff apparently anywhere 50 60? average trending up. seem track getting millions vaccinated daily number cases still increasing. quite 0%, pretty damn close  good, thank you... hypocrites around us plentiful days. wasn’t Biden office see dramatic turnaround?

It defense production act... know intentionally slow, but

Here public school's doc: private school doc: Mancunian, long, severe lockdown. even get three weeks autumn/winter current discussion? due mostly 3 month+ long lockdown get cases down. similar position last summer barely cases/deaths well. However, time vaccines! hope keep going fast enough avoid third wave. 1st dose moderna Yep, made movie 5-10 years way world really reacted, one would bought it.  Seeing news like always makes wonder many lives could've saved someone competent charge 2020 dehumanization. good one isnt it? “Get lawn!” children think anyway... human beings, citizens, future adults? Pshaw! right opinion! /s Sounds pretty much useless. Results can't trusted. seeing people constantly forever. wear mask cough best do. meeting people may ask? Work, kids adult sports, shopping, gym, etc. got vaccine 5 g certified now. Bill sent telepathic messages yet, I'm expecting day... I'd tell I'm getting vaccinated still go get vaccine. Fuck that. Suffolk county always reports late, one bigger numbers doctors one classified extremely high risk. She’s max amount medicines can’t go anything more. Flu hospitalizes her. aren’t concerned death. concern permanent damage already fragile lung issues. gets damage, life changes drastically. always need stickers hard hat lol Children exist. people immunocompromised can't get vaccines. model around us continue right thing. Ideally right thing getting vaccine need masks till safe populations unable vaccinated. Article mandated. act like maskless inevitability. massive pressure get vaccinated even single case escaping quarantine trigger lockdown. dealing quarantine hotel failure average every 2 weeks. controlled excellent contact tracing system, three times send Auckland lockdown. I’m reporting people thinking. Wishing felt different believing shouldn’t feel way doesn’t change anything except alienating them. agree think it, simply don’t feel way. offered something benefits rather offering something benefits someone else? government let foreign medics work. vaccinated? gonna drive nuts, FTA stand for? really moved. Much white hesitancy reading Reddit?! Go get shot! think dream would find pan-coronavirus vaccine could admistered wild animals could put bits food (like oral rabies vaccine). youre downvoted pro choice :( Posting vids luxury cars bought hotel rooms cash bills, idiot Aww hope feels better. light swab tests state. brain swabs. definitely still hated nose sucking. almost like vaccines work. Chick Norris still part crowd? Well wife holding up? sure, may even totally self serving? opinion, getting end borders, it’s still running rampant elsewhere, still issue. assume ppl downvoting (rightfully) feel proud excited US finally something right pandemic, understand, still feel bit conflicted.

[RIP childhood Look Turkey. trajectory. happens minimal/no preventive measures place. Check Twitter feel like started since covid. struggle remember names people I've known decades. take allergy meds every day can't remember I've taken not. couple days forgot let dogs spent night outside. like I'm fog days. don’t think considers real virus given it’s relatively high survival rate cases doesn’t think rises level pandemic. also expect kind behavior tons people get vaccinated though, 6k infections even considering really impressive. shreds say? long people aren’t irresponsible getting vaccinated. it’s worth, feel way haven’t COVID. think lot lack normal human interaction neurons going stale result. Rushing defense known racist pos really garner patience. He’s jackass republican shit. post said care that? extrapolation existing RKI vaccination data currently says 70% Germans vaccinated Aug 15th. fateful day everything changed. world never covid caught syphilis.  It’s UNLIKELY IMPOSSIBLE. everyone rest easy, Tim Allen called Capitol rioters. may conservative, he's total wacko. I’m curious comment downvoted mine upvoted we’re saying thing. Things like concern comes people understanding public health messaging. much evangelical Americans love Israel, pastors using selling point vaccine. It’s hard medical opinion starkly different one political party’s. they’re saying something blatantly wrong walk eggshells possibly say something factually incorrect non political? Dang already :/

It's easy mean, car fine 99% time, would happy. person never car? recent rapid growth eye-popping, especially long. look daily cases histogram happened nicer guy CDC also says wearing plastic bag head fully vaccinated... lose trust CDC/WHO last years events reevaluate life decisions. point people need know. Since covid already, risk lower, getting shot available lower risk people.  downvoting entirely wrong post literally make sense considering context person saying additional 100 million top additional order. like what, EU wrong eyes? order deliver immediately get exterminated?

What referring to? 100mio extra doses story clause original contract pfizer.

EU want pay premium prices vaccines countries outbid us. Countries EU lagging behind comparable countries. say EU horrible bad this.

 See also want context EU secured lowest prices Either understand celebrity is, aware anything occurred 1990. JFC, calm down. siding him, suggested possible reason get immediately tested. Lmao love reading things like It’s safety theater, suppose idea behind food-drink rule prevent people socializing like would bar drink hand.

I’m glad CT put together clear pathway reopening, it’s happening soon. I’m actually surprised—I thought New England (minus NH) would hang onto stuff long time. Huh. Well, get afterlife I'll sure pass people know gun violence victims. comforting rational. mean, feel much better rattled little talking points. 

There already limits freedoms. argument disingenuous. 

 Gun control reasonable restriction, majority Americans, including responsible gun owners. No-one coming precious guns. ""dangerous freedom"" cronies arbiters constitutes freedom tyranny country. Oh no! could happened?!
 /s Great...I got disease inbred hillbilly. go shot 1 hours. allays fears bit little issue shot 1. Ah, well I'm glad good okay! totally unsurprising make less garbage. Ok? two things contradict other. says:
9.2 million doses Pfizer/Biontech
10.8 million doses Moderna
9.1 million doses CureVac

It question delivered relative J&amp;J would nice see go way Rush well Yeah, you’re right pal: Ted Nugent couldn’t possibly arranged at-home testing (which readily available literally anyone access healthcare.) You’re totally right. /s Herman Cain something something chat I'm sure vary one CVS another, checked desk front CVS, walked back, waited 30 seconds someone pharmacy print paperwork call over, sat down, got shot, waited 5 minutes, got left. Literally smooth operation could ask for. 5 minutes early scheduled time. worst. Considering company keeps, much surprise, still. Exactly, Mike Pillow would VP messing quick buck Hard much sympathy deniers get sick. Especially given wife nearly died black mold back. respiratory system borked now. possible asymptomatic two week period? Regardless even that's case, that's still another great anecdote vaccine job even dose 1. Glad son seems recovering well diligent conscientious poor. heartless rich. Sad despite amazing Covid protocols adhered tougher neighborhoods, still hit harder. think wearing mask means bunkered weird person. Someone could wear mask public rest life suffer minor discomfort heat. Plus would guess would generally get sick less often. It’s funny comparing Trump’s Biden’s endorsement pages Wikipedia. Biden nearly every B lister trump people mentioned here. Hmm. Thought dead already. Roseanne Barr. veritable who's minor celebs right desperately promote relevant. I’d interested demographics 6000 74 l, unfortunately, passed away. Perhaps underlying conditions contributed contraction/passing. Wango Tango! 
Full Pandango! 
Yo La Tango! 
Ooooh yeah! (ooh) 
Baby!  AMC MOOOOON I've seen post throughout year dude, really need find way there. seem like they're gonna change covid 0 worldwide, something happening anytime soon. ever. Considering younger (sub 65 believe) women bigger chance dying AZ corona think frustrating. Several countries stopped using entirely this, example: Norway Denmark. That’s Debby today, she’ll update list tomorrow folks. Yes pay US taxes, usually much US residents, often not, pay taxes country residence, reduces amount need pay IRS. Half sub clearly live hahah country opened vaccinations 18 may 1. planning get may 1 itself.

I hope grant plants may increase production. Projections made experts indicate wave wane may 2nd week. Combined natural infection vaccinations hopefully turn corner around June last week July first week cover 50 percent population atleast one dose sept love went endless ""we need vaccine fast"" ""woah woah that's fast, need testing"" Canadian, please send us doses can. Plus sooner reopen shared borders normal life be. 

However, Canada getting past peak, things getting better soon got significant portion vulnerable people vaccinated, still lot people hospitals provinces dying (the US still deaths proportion population even though Canada peak third wave), doses could useful South America instance. _mostly_ say that, still discourage medium large gatherings, unmasked encounters higher risk people, neither particularly Lmfao that’s best one I’ve heard far Cases Oregon 2.4x higher past four weeks, rising. Hospitalizations doubled well.  Covid asymptomatic huge % people. It’s low death rate. 

I positive PCR test December symptoms far mild typical cold. 

Many people completely unconcerned covid reason.

I still tell people get vaccine public interest reduce risk variants, many people need get personal benefit care. ok charge deliver life-saving vaccine first pandemic. area Saskatchewan (North) they're taking appointments people 40 up. week half ago 50+ people 30s able start booking appointments time now. people seem able get week book, too. I've seen quotes everyone vaccinated June-July. Straight tf up. People area stubborn jackasses guidelines whole time. That's evolved vaccine hesitancy.  


Unless I'm mistaken: unvaccinated people gathering pandemic = transmissions, &amp; transmissions = chances mutations, &amp; mutations able bypass vaccines. Considering contagious shit long symptoms take show would think vaccine-resistant mutation would pretty good foothold noticed. foothold denier-rich neighborhood, would get control? We'd sent pretty close square one forced develop new vaccine. 


But trying point sub, among others, gets downvoted hell apparently I'm supposed think vaccines existing = pandemic over. Wanting continued caution roll vaccines makes doom-saying antivaxxer reason. want current vaccines remain effective leave fucking house high risk kid. entirely dependant location, whether talking governmental mandates private businesses themselves. governmental mandates live, businesses still them. depending are, may already lifted. Even outdoor gatherings adherence masks much less, take look NBA vs. MLB games fans lately protests took place last summer mixed mask usage. going get point think people wearing masks outdoors situation summer, crowds crowds. Yeah lol, better getting virus itself. Fauci largely supported premise coming soon too. Oh god; hurt. 😔 Wrong. Flat wrong. Also, ""based fear"" completely bullshit always been. Caution fear thing.

People opinions point March, yet determined conclusively.

This still investigated late May last year, remember correctly.

Now, take *that* long determine disinfecting groceries efficient use time, shame many offices decided declare COVID-safe hand-washing stations lots surface cleaning packing people open office settings requiring masks. (So stupid!)

But cautious period virus new firm grasp spread dumb.

That's medical science works. Even early results suggested much (and aware those!), wait reproducibility becoming confident.

Also note reading data good idea. Even us professionals interpreting data generally shy away trying draw conclusions data sets familiar with, good reason! knew many vaccine ordered would delivered. think threw dart calendar picked april? point US stockpiling vaccines rate much higher administrating. good anyone. masks aren’t gross uncomfortable?

Good mask greasy? Maybe try washing it?

Because traps grease face. Masks hot humid trap grease face. Yeah, still sounds anti gun tastes. despise capitalism, liberal economics go me, sorry. Canada lagged U.S., U.K., etc. fact [it's around 23rd behind Chile, Hungary, Uruguay, etc. 

They've care pharmaceutical industry makes money think fair country pull ahead everyone else saying they'll pay more, getting vaccines, going ""haha kidding"". We're Florida, less populated red California. I'm pretty jealous signed phone right eligible still gotten call, yet extra shots reason? I'm patiently waiting! That’s one way look it.
Natural selection work. 
The thing is, stupid taking many good people them.  masks aren’t gross uncomfortable? Greasy? mask greasy? Maybe try washing it? 

They’re slightly annoying it’s something anyone know thinks twice about. Definitely enough constantly complain them. guess people nothing better complain about? No, believe indoor portions event Logistically speaking, would've nearly impossible sadly unless able vaccinate significant part population back start year. country population like 1.4 billion, significant amount living tight poor living conditions. matter effective lockdown was, virus gonna find way spread India due shear size population. sure that's problem? surprise remaining refusers. got Pfizer Part I. Totally worth getting course thing fucking shit lol. Passed floor cant raise left arm. Hurrah! Tell everyone know-Veterans, spouses caregivers get vaccinated VA-don’t need honorable discharge. Sure I'll throw too. seems like many countries going relying people vaccinated keep track case numbers potential development variant. Irish government (perhaps unrealistically high) expectations public respect vaccination, prospects acceptance adherence another lockdown widespread vaccination low. Spring Summer months 2021, outside activities better ventilation, help must prepare now, especially next Winter increased indoor gatherings poorly ventilated spaces.  likely people become vaccinated, adherence public health measures, e.g. mask wearing, social distancing, regular hand washing etc. decrease work positive effects vaccination campaign. Rapid testing together vaccination, deployed, along public health measures, way decreasing risk transmitting COVID-19 well maintaining effectiveness current vaccination minimising spread new variants. recall, government surveys Google GPS information indicate people strongly following rules. Almost last year first lockdown. Upvoted clear sources, thank you.

I would argue many employers forcing employees get vaccine. someone genetic disposition blood clots, already infected COVID, presents unfair dilemma person question. 

Likely FDA banned (and think continue have?) alternative vaccines without rare risk long term complex health issues. trump say took off? often used mock him? kind shit one biggest reasons I'm fan single payer healthcare.

It's going complicated mess one way another -- complicated mess *for patient*. Let private manufacturers, hospitals, govt insurance bash heads details: get patient damn healthcare leave bank account alone. That's exactly group probably need offer carrot for. tell people lives go back normal get vaccinated, think will. also enraged wear pants? Even 97.6% claim little dubious, vaccine appears high efficacy rate regardless, cheap make. good vaccine options better, regardless feel Russian government. According Bloomberg we've hit 910M worldwide doses!

Days from:

0-100M: 49 days

100-200M: 19 days

200-300M: 15 days

300-400M: 11 days

400-500M: 8 days (March 25th)

500-600M: 7 days (April 1st)

600-700M: 6 days (April 7th)

700-800M: 6 days (April 13th)

800-900M: 6 days (April 19th)

According Ourworldindata actually reached 900M yesterday I've following overall data Bloomberg I'll go site.

The good thing we'll hit Billion week, hopefully J&amp;J gets back track pace faster. Novavax can't come soon enough. Oh no!

Anyway... Ted awful person damn sick fuckin riff like nuclear bomb, everyones fun show up, boom, everyone dead Can't help list updated many times year looking tells nothing fall. doesn’t make pandemic. (Not agree him.) also It’s pathetic laugh people’s suffering  Take account plants specified volume doses produced depends yield. likely problem much lower yield easily turn 10m dose / month plant 5m dose / month plant. part makes something rabidly anti drug.

On this, sacred days, would like point stuck weed left girls alone everyone would much happier.   Anecdotal story time, wife's industry tasting ""off"" since bout covid last fall. worried career ramifications awhile.

It came back couple weeks ago, basically overnight (one day difference massive, according her). idea why. might one lucky ones. Heh, hopes prayers. wear whole box masks control group: unvaccinated population. care calculus demographic normalization.

Yes, obviously can't assume equal parts. point assumption show ridiculous number was. 80 times number deaths gone insanely rosy assumption. like 10x number 'people*days' unvaccinated partially vaccinated vs. fully vaccinated.


But, hey, lets keep shoving 100% number door like backfire faces. That's shame first Pfizer shot last week. mild fever, nothing much that. worked day. 

I 2nd shot scheduled took day work hear 2nd killer. May take day also, depending feel. found link profile. read article taken look references? actually published November 2020, peer reviewed, nearly every analysis references disagrees author arguing says enough data make conclusion.  I'm really trying blame one group another, many could done better made better decisions this. wanted counter question comparing state covid numbers. Tourists visited Florida contracted covid stay would attributed home state, Florida. state shut early, numbers best couple peaks 

Of course were, many families ""stuck tradition"" around world. F dude. Sorry, allow anecdotal posts including posts results polls. welcome post link comment Daily Discussion thread, stickied sub's front page.

As far going visit family UK, suspect able summer. Countries like UK France talking opening Americans May-July timeframe. got vaccinated?

Also living apartment get 4 person elevator, never know someone sneezing coughing top touching buttons. 

I get dude saying getting mild cold once, maybe twice year seem like 
Weak immune system me. actually heard thread. fundamental issue overestimated yield per day per litre virus growing stage. affected production everywhere. Growing biological products hard take get yield site starts up. Overestimating final yield long take reach reduces production terms doses per month cascaded production process.

I don’t know whether used clearly unrealistic yield estimates start unusually bad luck getting new biological processes yield notoriously hard can’t help thinking cautious production estimates.

(Also, AZ EC contractual dispute, news article read context info strategically leaked one party another. doesn’t make untrue worth keeping mind) mild case. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Every university rules, yes, require vaccinations - least live dorms. actually kind reverse. ""influential"" people circles sick dying thought: OK tragic, perhaps wake signal everyone else. joke made up. real harming even killing people.

But Herman Cain died going rally Trump purposefully defying safety measures. publicity dramatic irony ""important"" figure trump sacrificed attending trump rally flaunting issue exist, written book shown movie screen, audience would groaned top nose was. (Trump declined attend Cain's funeral)

At point. feel mainly pity people would willingly sacrifice lives sad obviously phoney ideal. mean, use 10 mi line. Plenty people live within 10 mi sort commercial facility, even 10 mi another residential household. 🥳😂🤣.dipshit. mean, getting virus confirm pandemic. 142 million cases 3 million worldwide deaths does, see 1 person getting virus change opinion. Pls expire Without Biontech/Pfizer we'd fucked EU. citation this? We'll seeing stories like one soon enough. Refuse vaccine, inevitably get COVID. 

It's hard understand. Well, unless Ted Nugent. alive anyway, informed us Obama silence forever. Tim Allen snitch though. Please die. Sensationalism. nothing contribute aside spectacle. Keep mind, vaccinated population currently skews towards vulnerable. mortality rate far greater 1%. Yeah would choose to? though, countries size, great apples apples comparison. I'll still never forget twitter account blasting Covid misinfo died. Like ""hey, sure died, big deal"" He's got us stranglehold babe-eh! He's famous still level fame/infamy course he's going hangers on. reinforce idiotic beliefs. Could specifically name racist against? Harvey Weinstein? Ted Nugent? Donald Trump? Elizabeth Warren?

Please specific. valid reason feeling way. Try relax avoid CNN. add Gina Carano sad list. LOL!! Thank this. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* understanding several articles VAERS reported blood clots vaccines-- here's difference though, CVST-style blood clot linked J&amp;J AZ found pfizer moderna. DVT-style found (mRNA) normal. DVT type blood clots common general population.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: important note covid poses much higher risk blood clots vaccines. 72 year old COVID, treatments would probably good idea. Maybe actually got them. Ironically covid thought may cat scratch fever. part late late 2019/early 2020 crowd thought Pneumonia. kept hearing symptoms like, Oh shit, that. Antibodies confirmed it. wife literally back back. hell. agree reported cases among vaccinated people likely higher 5,800, also keep mind reported cases among *unvaccinated* people likely underreported. it’s tough tell whether mortality rate ‘breakthrough’ cases comparable mortality rate unvaccinated infected individuals What's title study authors? I'll take look. link random news source, send info study. ""Gee, that's bad."" name it, shorter text excuses. die? wish.... also work industry, it’s two days since I’ve back don’t tastings conditions covid moment, I’m curious regulars caught would affect them. personally better sense smell coworkers would pissed happened industry. It’s kinda whole point. Racism unfairly judging every member group skin color, actions few. It’s illogical. Judging every celebrity actions illogical problem. Nothing wanting actor/singer makes someone bad person. 

The thing I’d say characteristic celebrities/actors tend emotional, good bad, think gravitate democrats foundation caring others. Also never covid living pandemic brain fog. sucks. dude fit hold EVH's dick takes piss. Alle comments above: ""this guy different opinion corona me, better die it""

What's wrong people guy covered shit acted crazy avoid drafted. Ironically that’s strategy Trump employed successfully get elected.  thought libruhl elite wanted permanent lockdown??? I've vaccinated. period came two weeks early first shot week early second shot. mind going vacation June going period new dates, yeah, happens people. 

My co-worker late 40s period since December. thought done them. got second shot last week period shown up.

I'm super pro-vax done kids whatever, give pause takes 200m doses administered US women talking internet researchers start even looking it. 

(And two pre-teen daughters. love vaccines! always vaccines. worried approved age?) want get shot I'm scared. already deal exact symptoms (minus fever) anemia want shot make worse. Yeah he'd admit made weak. kind macho dipshit never admit that, like Trump ded? don’t think anymore IIRC OK BFF Sean Hannity quote Common's lyrics Ted Nugent raping kids **can** get without it, won't. Vaccine hesitancy high chance get down, we'll able vaccinate teens. Fuck puto Well let’s hope it’s rough him. would remind Ohio Indiana exist, much stronger claims title.

[3%, Even low estimates [just preventing symptomatic cases, 80% reducing hospitalizations, still puts targets vaccines.  

Hungary using [every vaccine Chinese ones.  

And Uruguay [using Pfizer   vaccines got early access using public challenge trials... 

Same article says, Uruguay got later even Canada. 

Again, vaccine still separate *distributing* vaccine efficiently quickly. guy tried donate new gym/building high school wanted name said lol plus side masks mandates go away easier identify folks mental illness summer.

Tots pears, Ted. Cries Detroit, MI ever get interviews people get it? change behaviors since vaccinated January, work dental, someone's mouth high risk. tested positive past Saturday even though going out, seeing friends, anything like that; I'm pretty sure got work.   It’s noted exposed covid officially get symptoms first one. However lot people first dose breeze ted nugent dies, I'll crack smile. OK. would somebody refuse vaccine 100%? country people get less effective vaccine yet majority take vaccine soon get appointment.  US enough vaccines vaccinate everyone vulnerable point enough vaccines vaccinate everyone fully like month two. Meanwhile India seeing exponential growth cases + deaths.

It's strange US still imposing bans likely going lead thousands thousands preventable deaths India's vaccine production greatly reduced due this. India likely production point large section worlds supply We've built culture around excusing ignoring bad aspects people really, ridiculously good talent. don’t near someone yell them. hard understand?

Ok whatever want tell yourself. COVID good Covid bad? GOP poster D-list idiot musician child. Always been, really one. two countries Canada make vaccine. *again* vaccine, distribution. Canada done poorly distributing quickly receiving shipments. Hell, U.S. done terrible job efficiently distributing it, compared been. Israel good job securing vaccine *and* distributing efficiently, clear plan.

At least understanding situation I'm virologist. last tally 40 US colleges universities require covid vaccine. Amazing, thx information kind sir.

I've New York Summer 2019 gotta say, miss city (and United States general) every single day.. live Texassssss plan. hope effective anti-viral treatments autumn. meaning Twitter mob? lol mean? Kids don’t need Isn’t high number... 6000 infected pokes gentle bro 😏 indeed. Pretty much EU countries around 20% first doses. Bulgaria Latvia lagging behind. guess, thought poke sounded gentler jab ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Get vaccinated come visit us 😊 You’re talking a$$ change totally agree here, issue supply. best could available us pandemic started told, terms vaccinations we're terribly. fact, unless I'm misremembering, Ontario gotten higher proportion vaccines population compared rest Canada due density.

My issue entirely scattershot distribution. We've know better part year vaccines coming. We've also known impossible get everyone vaccinated it'll done vaccines come in. known that, baffling government spend time making sort unified appointment system province, maybe even general waiting list. Instead people lining hours trying get vaccine simple booking appointment online (which places province bother single system hospitals PHUs pharmacies coming solutions). Seriously. That’s drives nuts see comments like “don’t blame media, report facts.” Really? Cuz different ways report facts. Americans pay almost twice Canadians pay. Americans pay $11,000 per year, way $6,600. 

And never said prescriptions free, said millions Americans can't afford theirs. Canadians can. Yeah I'm really worried provinces seemingly thinking vaccinate way third wave, apparently realising there's least two-week lag even *if* somehow get 50%+ vaccinated soon. Make 5 Yeah dumbass governor fucked recreational part. I'm glad we’ll medical marijuana people need it, Noem’s husband works agricultural insurance something like tends make policies choices make money. Weed hemp covered whatever insurance thing husband does, therefore get money. undermining people’s vote option, apparently. Plus still see unvaccinated friends watching go gym either a) dick move part b) likely make relax safety precautions.


I'm like blasting across social media I'm going gym suck cause vaccinated. I'm going gym dude.

All I'm saying people want go gym shame so. We've year vaccinated allowed things shame free. vaccines work it? No. I’ve covid got second shot yesterday. same. felt crappy fatigued shot, chest congestion. case loads down. dependent number people get vaccinated anything else. people get vaccinated, faster case loads drop, faster masks come off. 

States low uptake vaccines likely longer time masks may recommended case loads could remain high longer.

For states, could early point May. others, may mid summer depending things go. Putting defined timeline challenging impossible predict case loads month. 16+... US... See, love New York lol Yes, everyone loses smell/ taste. give free donut people got fully vaccinated also? Safety first, yes I'd expect see safer update uv sanitizing implemented widespread sister law vaccine hesitant works hospital. told hospital, self insured, cover treatment got covid refused vaccination. idea legal, worked.

there's vaccine. people get every year.

10's millions infected.

Happy helped! important us call bad information shoddy journalism whenever see it. Welcome!! Fauci needs stop attention craving start listening science. I'm getting paranoid state follow Michigan, Oregon, Virginia legislating ""permanent"" restrictions. Here's hoping national peak effect vaccines prevent this.

Last summer think restrictions could last 2021, are. That's I'm wary normalcy predictions, even vaccine. It’s health! Nice lay man's term - double mutant That's 10-15 allowed get vaccinated Thanks using firefox focus always incognito. try methods see read it. assume ploy get people vaccinated, long going run for? Cuomo recently opened adults, large majority people even allowed get vaccine  marketing I'm for. free dab bro Yeah absolutely, I'm criticizing people running program get people vaccinate. that's way gotta it, it. yeah, people man... Hopefully second isn’t bad. Personally, second much worse. felt like bad cold. plus side, lasted 24 hours. Really dumb movie, kid really grated nerves, too. vaccine news filled people comments either A:

Complaining still follow guidelines vaccinated many leaders literally exit plan restrictions.

or B)

Insisting can't lift restrictions people vaccinated. take seatbelt. can't 'un-take' vaccine. all.  God, right. COVID 1 18 walks park. Idiot. city’s mayors terrible reputation, I’m surprised hypocritical. fine shots doctor want shots police officer? also makes headline straight lie. joke. chinese tourist business money still good pass especially already vaccinated everyone wants get vaccinated EU gonna hijack post mention otters poopy dance. 

It's really adorable expresses feeling shared many us animals. people idiots stick germy mouths fountain spigot.  Yeah like hard date, estimated timeline would nice Ah thank first shot knocked ass (pfizer). second shot 2 hours, drinking water took tomorrow off. 24 36 hours feeling run much better COVID 19 imho. missing? Surely, logic faulty somewhere

That chance catching COVID vaccinated 95% lower unvaccinated.

So unlikely catch COVID first place. downer, worldwide three million deaths. seeing child COVID data I’m seeing? COVID severe some, that’s abundantly clear. It’s also clear it’s severe lot others (like children instance) can't believe mayor Red Sox fan  Wtf happened NYC grew anti smoking campaigns sudden like one cares. New York simultaneously rails dangers vaping hands joints street. npr restaurant critic lost sense taste months months. really, mean really, figured people mild asymptomatic cases covid others don’t? happens something like mask becomes political message.

Masks final type restriction go. restriction makes restrictions less necessary. Definitely big screen movie terms effects. fully sold since release vaccinations started yet, plus paid *Godzilla, King Monsters* regretted (plus able see day date HBO Max.)

But right. Returning cinema big experience can't really duplicate home going big part feeling like things back normal. Plot twist; person licking rolling paper hepatitis arm moderately sore two days Moderna #1. husband's even worse - could barely lift it. Apart that, felt groovy. We're going round two Friday. gonna lie, I'm kinda anxious hearing second dose side effects. I'm getting necessary chores errands done case feel like shit. supposed soon. I've seen excuse lot anti vaxers. move onto different excuse regular approval. Pfizer vaccine alone probably 100 million doses given out, probably people received drug seeking approval history. anyone curious Sputnik: got first dose yesterday, started feeling cold literally shaking trembling 3 lasted 2 hours. got pretty bad headache lasted next day. felt okay day that, except 2-3 hour period middle day felt tired. 8 pm feel lot better. 2nd dose 3 weeks. India gonna hit 300k+ today.

Almost 5x growth 3 weeks. bit off-topic, think sounds permanent death knell cruise industry. Despite 100% vaccination, certain percentage still get die. like said, skew older cruise participants. every single cruise starts coming home 3-10 corpses hold, going good look.   Second shot Moderna hours. First sore arm fatigue days. Intentionally scheduled middle week sick time work day save weekend. justification kids needing isolate like 100x weaker year ago point.

So guess hope makes speedy recovery? feel like covid-19 old Nuge. “I got Chinese shit” Haters say cat scratch fever. Maybe. it’s looking like vaccine hesitancy coming young progressives. They’re also ones enrolled college. 

Having colleges mandate vaccines put huge dent hesitancy numbers. They’ll never reach percentages older people managed, college mandates natural immunity, numbers fine. I'd also speculate vaccinated people less likely get tested unvaccinated people. mild/asymptomatic cases likely caught level unvaccinated people still routine testing. would push CFR higher. yeah, vaccinated population much older general population also play role.  words murdered people. many caught died covid told hoax? “REA”. Hope helps. Lol UK currently running trial AZ given booster Pfizer vice versa, results relatively soon. largest cohort 100% reddit too. Karma doesn’t exist. # Fake   Nuge... fucking moron! good person are. try explain people vaccinated current process, prevent getting spreading others. 95% doesnt mean 95% safe getting it. Pretty sure meant Randy Quaid fuck even going about?

I need look signs weakness, right giving examples it.

It's funny ignorant Ted Nugent said Covid far pretend ignorant this.  👍🏻 Good. mean Randy Quaid  know much know change. Brought makers beefn’t hamn’t. US go 41,000 cases day 70,000?

I starting hope, I’m sure anymore. video laugh. 7 years ago. Source? EUs economy population matches US dependent them. Making fun dysfunctional US healthcare beg supplies hypocritical. COVID... thing. Fuck ted nugent shitty ass Claps Could please cite study behind that? found nothing shows vaccine prevents someone getting virus spreading it, importantly. source?    depends countries use J&amp;J - vaccine key finish vaccination effort mid July. Cat scratch fever? Never heard it. favorite line all... ‘they authorized vaccine 4 months’ without calling work Trump Administration pushing it.... one breathe trusts trump, another doesn’t.... Grow up. internets. Bowie thing questionable.

The author seems still self identify heavily tied period time groupie. reports positive experience also consistently tells different stories happened, sometimes involving people factually meet long afterward.  Good thing I'm wishing divine retribution, normal mortal karma. comparing maybe greatest guitarist generation probably top ten time. 

Yeah guys compare favorably eddie van Halen.  forget sexy stuff!

Fuck Ted. particularly wish well here.

Call intolerant left. missed point.

There time count breakthrough yet. 

There lag infection test results reported.  chav-in brits feel bad regular schmegular people. (referring U.S.) government systematically lied us, inspired paranoia, defunded education point surprise regular Joe ignorant.

But *every* privilege every ounce wealth *still* fail use noggin?

Man, feel bads melt away. happened nicer guy.  No, it’s evil. taking actions directly harm people. Sitting behind keyboard saying “hope get what’s coming you,” isn’t even close thing. wishing death send message counteract evil committed. handled people around getting vaccine? reference something? Never heard it. Ted’s possible death, tragic, probably save lives; and, Reddit comments grotesque incomprehensible you, people making also saving lives taking ‘rona seriously. can’t handle truth. EU probably exported vaccines then.    I've learned disconnect people's absolutely shit personalities/beliefs appreciate work. Amboy Dukes pretty damn good Free awesome jam.

Herman Cain posted response facebook. solutions widely available- which, depending live, basically least beginning be- we’re going move on. Long term restrictions simply reasonable justified, matter much certain scientists journalists push them.

In State live in, 10 people average died day flu every year. That’s fact one would known, much less cared pandemic. Eventually, probably soon we’re going honest, that’s coronavirus deaths start looked at. He's good technically good riffs obviously.

Medical personnel first responders got first every state, followed elderly. state managed plan, state opened everyone beginning, last weeks. opened tiers 10 years age. 75, 65, 55, etc. really really dislike everything Ted’s persona. I’ve playing almost four decades. Ted badass guitar player. Great chops accurate hell.

Plus played hard rock Byrdland guitar badass itself. It’s great big arch top jazz guitar. think he’s one plays guitar  ""This song six words long"" calls Cat Scratch Fever ""I tested positive today. got Chinese shit""

F guy. Can't shit pants get outta one, Ted. got second Moderna shot yesterday 430pm. husband took day work twin 10 month olds know I'd able care today (nope). arm feels broken bruised. around 7:30 morning body started hurting BADLY. shooting pains over. also feel little bit ""head fogginess."" also pregnant serious first trimester nausea top it. 

So glad get done. Normalcy can't come soon enough. nurse explained like this: immune system basically kind needs training. Show something once, know deal semi-effectively. Show something twice, it'll even better dealing it. That's also booster shots happen; makes body go ""oh shit, thing again. Better keep mind right now"".

Se vaccines depending virus one done, others need multiple doses order combat slight mutations factors, need constant treatments ridiculous level mutation (flu, example). Maybe he'll join Rush Limbaugh make world better place describing sounds like feelings towards many religious groups.
I'm glad feel need kill members though. weird United States Population accounts 4% World Population. somehow United States Accounts 19% total Covid-19 Deaths. Maybe counting wrong something. tried shitting month avoid Covid. fact, one struggles think man, who's supportive women's rights, Trump.

I tell wrong without also saying can't opinion. Well, lyricist he's exactly Cole Porter, he? Yeah, looking Twitter, seems generally pro-mask pro-vaccine, COVID denier.

So he's conservative, he's totally lala land like Ted Nugent. normally wish I'll people case hope shits pants dies. Hope takes ""personal responsibility"" getting himself, potentially spreading others. chiropractor website side note: read one tweets want turn guitar sexual freedom flamethrower!

I'll likely get airlines begin requiring it. “So, you’re vaccinated, please get vaccinated soon vaccine becomes available you. vaccinated, please remember still careful get involved crowded situations, particularly indoors people wearing masks.” - Fauci

While specifically meeting vaccinated people, raise concerns effectiveness vaccine protect public.  No, opposite. State Department warning Americans travel places.

These uncommon. State Department routinely warns Americans going countries/regions experiencing civil unrest/terrorism/unfriendly regimes/etc.

For example, per-COVID North Korea Iran ""Do Travel"" list. Lebanon ""Reconsider Travel"" list.

The lists updated since COVID world ""Reconsider Travel"" list due COVID, countries (Argentina Brazil, example) landing ""Do Travel"" list solely due COVID.

This article means State Department bumping world - 80% ""Do Travel"" list.

Practically mean anything - mean can't travel countries, advised it. i’m black? know LOT black people don’t like referring “blacks” know that, “black” fine sheesh don’t get ur panties wad weirdo  well Dr. Phil! done much disinformation, can't stand still held platform. don’t care it’s weird move considering whoever could google “US UK travel” see reports I’m simply passing on. ""He's person anymore"" 


 realize evil is? kind thinking insanely dangerous. lost touch reality. would likely walked lock step worst humanity offer, would able convince jews people anymore, non communists people anymore etc etc.  


You need help. getting closer closer point individual decide get vaccinated end dying. want thank area absorbing the, uh, whatever Ohio, West Virginia points west south. letting heavily spread farther east north. please die Good I’m black ain’t gender studies class real world don’t get tell people words use cause lighter skin tone think communism cool Huh... Anyway, anyone see game last night? pants shitting draft dodging statutory rapist. work geriatric women bleeds supposed cycling all? vaccines them? Hard get re-entry anxiety never stopped visiting places always did. Tough shut every mountain lake country ;) agree. That's person doing. implied white person can't opinion due race. know it. reality, doesn't. joking. watch pianist that's much worse lol. dies it. Even then, probably not.  Shot 1 fine (moderna). sore arm like 3 days, nothing otherwise. Shot 2 last Friday. Super shitty symptoms Saturday (fever, aches, nausea, etc) went away day lingering fatigue random aches.

Good luck. RIP friends family lost ignorance propaganda 2020. I'm 40, friends dating back high school ""broke up"" good. case, obvious Anti-BLM racism got first, Covid bullshit going also problem regardless.  watch CNN Might divergent opinions

You're allowed say ""racist"" ""fucking stupid."" need hide bigotry behind kind words. 1% time could maim kill you? Ted Nugent known 3 things: 1) loves hunting shoot anything shoot back him; 2) pedophile adopted 15 year old lover; 3) shit pants wash month order dodge Vietnam Draft. 

TLDR: Ted Nugent draft dodging pedophile refused help country fight war. Vexatious lawsuit realm possibility, I’ve heard... blame Biden/the Democrats. Mark words. really embarrassing get COVID late game. damn vaccine available. moron Ted died, happy it. also sad either.

I also understand perspective people wronged Ted. directly, Ted influence fans treats others like shit Ted tells too. online spam also repeats nonstop Sputnik reported side effects much safer bad western vaccine.

Lot people eat up. anyone public leadership’s goal - would gain reopening?

I’m sure hikikomori types there, vast majority people want return normalcy, included.

Public restrictions always red herring: mobility even places without existence deadly pandemic changes people’s behavior. way *actually solve problem* reducing case numbers getting people protected. 

After year faffing ineffective strategies, something works, soon reaping rewards. children actually spread virus less adults do.  Old rural conservative men already vaccinated.... 8. Taste music subjective act like I'm making shit up. list voted guitarists too.

I'm going comment live shows yeah Ted's good guitarist even great one, certainly guys greater him.    straight CDC website’s FAQ page. “Should still get vaccine already Covid-19?”
“IF treated COVID-19 monoclonal antibodies convalescent plasma, wait 90 days getting COVID-19 vaccine.” recommendation delaying initial dose beyond 10 days symptom onset days last symptom. 

Listen Daniel Griffin TWIV week goes almost every week. Monoclonal’s convalescent plasma may mute vaccines effectiveness short term. official recommendation get get outside stipulations. concern push vaccine hesitant away feeling vaccine safe eventually getting it.

But again, starts harming children, safe it? It’s thing highlight party “family values” scummy things. wouldn’t point discussion conservatives didn’t bring Hollywood constantly. two presidents SAG cards, Republicans. top head, Fred Thompson, Sonny Bono, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Clint Eastwood elected office Republicans. democratic side, Al Franken one think got mainstream support. Maybe Cynthia Nixon, I’m New Yorker didn’t seem popular (after all, lose).

Nobody gives shit Republicans weird (hopefully legal) sex shit disproportionately vote celebrities. constant projection hypocrisy things it’s funny. absolute shit tier celebrities get. know dislike him? “Chickenhawk” got service Viet Nam war acting shitting front draft board acting insane - yet day glorifies war hasn’t met conflict wasn’t ready send others go fight die. also numerous underage girlfriends making pedophile- even took legal guardianship girl Hawaii wouldn’t get trouble. He’s shitty person. Feces eerily similar chocolate ice cream, too. make comparison meaningful. stand logic right ? He’s got super high morals, allegedly... 6 7 million. Birth control \~6 10,000. That’s definitely good practice. It’s like say don’t meet heroes, they’ll almost always disappoint you. Enjoy art, let speak personal level, don’t put people behind pedestal. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼🎉🎉🎉 Bet mourned Rush Limbaughs death too, huh?   guess say coronavirus stranglehold. Sure: German government failed contain pandemic, even though multiple opportunities better job vaccinating slowing spread. increased number deaths Germany currently fault political officials. blood hands. take accountability whatsoever? Nope, instead try pass onto Querdenkern, even though many studies shown outdoor protests significantly increase transmission. Yet, government officials ignore science ban anyway, even though peacefully protesting basic human right. 

It's hard see anyone could look find human rights violation. also extremely disappointing me, someone used live Germany, German people refuse hold government accountable, would rather find easy scapegoats pretend everything fine, even locked year.

TLDR: political decisions hampered Germany's vaccine rollout led deaths far German citizens Querdenkern ever will. mods actually check auto-mod keep running appropriately, removed comment example ""incivility."" even subjectively. Thanks. feel seen. Huge extrovert, sports fan etc. Idk just... Go back problem right away!  happened FIL put empty chair porch left days. thought making statement looked trashy indoor furniture outside. swear like curse get say isn’t real loud. Piss me, beat Haha! getting 2nd round Covid. 

Sounds like bad. sucks piece shit. Immune system evading variants likely disproportionately fueled immunocompromised. absolutely encouraged vaccinate, stay home do. also think risk picture clear adults: vaccination save severe course disease. risk picture kids clear.

Also, people use argument rarely clear path forward... keep two years? goes right Krispy Kreme donuts... Hes old man im sure hes share common colds. He'll fine Surface cleaning reduces flu transmission though. reason keep it. Yeah stories India, Brazil, Philippines crazy scary right now. feel terrible poor folks options.

HR policy says medical NIOSH ASTM rated masks healthcare workers employees may wear risk purchasing depriving healthcare workers. Multilayered cloth masks disposable non surgical masks examples acceptable face masks. 

They also recently stated medical privacy reasons, vaccines may discussed work. may ask coworker planning getting vaccine someone already vaccinated, refrain mentioning vaccination status construed pressuring someone revealing theirs. 

I sort get reasons guidance think idea emergency rooms ordering N95 masks places absurd — supply chain small fraction N95 masks actually suitable healthcare workers past point HCWs desperately scouring eBay 3M paint sanding masks use hospital. Indeed, ilk goes around wishing death regular people soon karma hits ""oh he's still person"" shit like that. only.
