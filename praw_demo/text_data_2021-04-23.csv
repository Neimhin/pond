Oh, absolutely. got J&amp;J pause single dose regimen going godsend places like India. don‚Äôt like gung ho people plowing forward full steam ahead ignoring complications might arise. think CDC right thing pause informing public.

Depending state site it‚Äôs sometimes possible see advance vaccine offered making appointment. Children getting serious consequences Covid extremely rare. Welcome interior India. Every state different. adhere national standard go farther. Washington D.C protected classes. Cut paste sorry format.

Shit, Poland prime minister said last summer. extremely shortsighted him. two awful waves since killed around 100k (counting excess deaths), maybe more. Cause effect Awesome. Vaccinate whole world asap Bollywood must enormous budget... way 40m ready go. get fooled Russia, promise lot deliver few, look Argentina. course it'll help, let's delusional. really use ""less 2% people get polio paralyzed"" argument *against* getting polio vaccine? think that's fantastic reason get vaccinated. Holy shit!

Whoever runs account, everyone follows buys lies, absolute idiots! must happening small cities, towns villages. nightmare end date sight. well, it‚Äôs like forced go pubs/restaurants. it‚Äôs expensive make pubs/restaurants safe place, well, don‚Äôt go maybe? That's cool - Bundesland? checked Hamburg 70s yet ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Almost 900K day across world. Actual number easily nearing 9-10 million daily Thanks, hope too! got second dose yesterday! arm sore since last night, dont feel side effects far. Surprising heard lot horror stories second dose! Show exact quote. That‚Äôs 70 percent adults fully vaccinated 52 percent population. predictions first dose total population. right we‚Äôre 49 percent one dose. Meaning we‚Äôll definitely hit 52 percent first dose probably sometime next week current pace four weeks later people vaccinated right time deadline. agree. guess point seriousness scope little different talking requirement employees must get injected drug FDA approval. seems little invasive.

In 10 years 60% vaccinated people skin cancer, companies required vaccines going liable? happened everywhere really, first vaccine given everyone acted already. could prevented another 6-8 weeks precautions. Dec 31? Needs May 31st. Light fire ass. Thank saying this. Like yes J&amp;J less risk Covid, but... Moderna Pzifer even less risk. Someone win lottery, risk alternative vaccine quite honestly US Pzifer Moderna plenty easy get. reading Expanse novels churn describe feels like now, especially peaks. vaccine rollout botched, exceeded expectations, reasonable otherwise - decided would better get breadth depth - science backing up. emotionally invested idea bad idea, obvious political reasons, hold onto outlier validation. different people use vaccination side effects validation anti vaccination stance - ignoring science inconvenient working backwards conclusion. 

There plenty studies conducted test efficacy mixing vaccines, virologists even expecting better protection mixing different vaccination technologies. Several people complained lockdown see would happened wasnt one. lol !remindme april 2022 Definitely, that's got shot lol I'm way worried covid vaccine asked tell everyone get it. I'm saying get people scared take it. crazy people either think government conspiracy anti-vaxxers. 

The vaccines got fast tracked seem like we're learning side effects we're pushing out. That's scary part, even healthcare professionals can't give definitive answer topic. silver lining incidents incredibly isolated unlucky millions. appointments 21 days apart, it‚Äôs Pfizer. 28, moderna It‚Äôs already confirmed it‚Äôs new variant. sure guy even arguing lol German R&amp;D exact Brazil's test decent, report test, numbers months. know much tested. Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine division really one best world. It‚Äôs shame prior pandemic many big pharma companies saw money vaccines shut sold generics manufacturers warning seems fair, could also used fear mongering. anyone explain vaccine either based adenovirus attenuated SARS-CoV-2 virus thing? people know symptoms post shot covid, either got vaccine site days prior. get checked. pretty insane. age everyone connected, rather listening facts getting pandemic together, people chose follow spread misinformation leading ground breaking numbers. could better sunk lower change requirements employment. Seen happen many times. good one. managerial position hospital. job decade. 

HR changes education requirements position include college education. People position grandfathered in. would given set time enroll complete degree. 

Hospital changes tobacco policy order lower costs employer provided health insurance. Employee use tobacco given opportunity join hospital provided smoking cessation class. 3-6 months time frame. comply. terminated. 

Hospital state recently legalized marijuana use. Hospital charges drug screening process longer test THC initial hire. 

State changes ethic standards medical licenses. DUI result instant license revocation. 

Those head, real scenarios. could come researched outside system work for. case found literally day appointment using. could chosen another one broke appointment, would reschedule several weeks later. choice, guess, wanted remain unvaccinated longer time span. yes, choice, it‚Äôs simple showing pointing one you‚Äôd prefer. (And case waiting came additional risks, dumb health stuff. also news J&amp;J landed days got stuck. terrific timing. clots yet, fingers crossed.)

All said, much sucks looking people‚Äôs health statistically, think reinstating J&amp;J right choice grander scheme things. world needs pull together help all. Im sorry. say hopefully decrease soon. :::hugs::: year we‚Äôll golden graph vertical take can't good. That's going hurt. seem remember reading even people live together chances contracting another household member around 30%, possible lucky. guess also possible got least one false negative, given family circumstances would continue quarantine safe side. hope family ok makes quick recovery! correct, found BNT162b2 lipid nanoparticle‚Äìformulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine encodes prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike 4 months. 4 months maximum target. receive second dose 2 3 months. reserve judgement someone explain waiving IP rights actually improve speed delivery India's needy, attempted rip off. Meaning? Moderna publication says protein held perfusion confirmation. meant altered rna able yes stabilizing mRNA. it‚Äôs going appear exactly immune system natural infection spike protein would appear. Thus hopefully producing worrisome side effects. Even hepa filters smog mask stock everywhere. reuse months, access ffp3 (n99) masks got easier. Yeah, that's insane compare two... Fair point, can't think company policy change I've ever heard anywhere close seriousness forcing employees get injected drug approved FDA. IIRC male birth control trials many adverse events giving man ‚Äúa bit headache‚Äù prevented widespread use.

Many men would love opportunity control chance getting someone pregnant without condom usage (or secondary form top condoms). Isn‚Äôt catch22? spike protein causing trouble immune system infection surely would also cause trouble introduced means? (Vaccine etc). Vaccines supposed train immune system spot virus stop replication early. covid19, challenge many cases immune system causing issues directly later on, virus replication itself. I‚Äôm certain fix this... Hey best wishes hope science gets us lot farther road sub way since started following January lol. nice pause vaccine surge happening focusing instead. Oh saw indoor outdoor dining yea without curfew iftars big issue
My country 9 pm curfew I‚Äôm generally opposed really help iftars considering people dont wanna gather eat leave immediately Central govt floated tender 162 PSA oxygen plants ‚Äî eight months pandemic. 

States role play contracts. wish people could use common sense. Picnickers sitting 20 ft apart talking quietly even remotely comparable shoulder-to-shoulder chanting singing loudly. Update employee handbook give people 3 months comply. Happens damned time. paper January. fingers crossed Brazil! least things planned. good point. India ~4 times US population (~1.3+ billion ~330 million). 3-4 months increasingly impressive organized vaccine rollout effort, US recently passed 200 million shots administered. sense scale, even used single-shot vaccines, 3-4 month effort India would still leave billion population unvaccinated. I‚Äôm expert means, would worry India also might infrastructure match pace US rollout (especially healthcare already overloaded COVID hospitalizations). So...Surging supplies India would probably take quite months make significant impact.

That‚Äôs say don‚Äôt think supplying vaccine (I do), even epically massive supply surge wouldn‚Äôt kind panacea given sheer scale immediacy problem. also, don‚Äôt know would be. It‚Äôs horrible situation around. Well lockdown since november always patient getting pretty annoying getting thrown sometimes pointless rules restrictions impact think goes slow, pace improvement last weeks daily record 2 weeks ago purpose pause then? basically saying, yep sure causing deaths benefits outweigh risks? ""pause"" for? could said without pause, like anything changed. imagine year trying get 75% people vaccinated next round shots year people seeing side effects, concerns, etc. Got 2nd dose Pfizer thjs past Tuesday. Wednesday arm fairly sore felt kinda ""off"". Felt fine Thursday. coming week getting gym membership unfrozen going back following Tuesday since 2 full weeks since 2nd shot. Probably go dine somewhere. last dine restaurant fucking Applebee's friend's bday early March 2020. take it, healthcare worker this. 

If claim religious medical exemption need request reasonable accommodation ADA. company gets see accommodation made. Direct care patients? accommodation. guess point study call action investigate, issues found; develop vaccine safer. could accomplished modifying spike protein, potentially. Thank that. hope soon, good know options :) explain why? Twitter thread breaks pretty well. India situation heartbreaking worse like O, amiright!? 

Sorry, I'll show out... comment reminded news story popped news feed last year COVID stated getting closer closer daily happened N95 masks, hand sanitisers, disinfectant liquid even merit second glance normal times 

All snapped price flippers hoarders like KY man? Pericarditis myocarditis common symptoms covid itself. Obviously vaccine can't give covid, wondering there's link here. Kind silly round mob mentality go someone posting vaccination information bias towards ‚Äúconsent informed vaccination‚Äù whatever fuck happening there. allowed sift facts, come conclusions here, would come someone different platform?

There‚Äôs lot opinions disagree with, don‚Äôt see overtly harmful there, silencing would give voices power open yet another account lol think it‚Äôs important look countries ‚Äúeverybody decided one particular moment stop following rules‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really seem like it‚Äôs plausible reason.

It looks like developing/middle income countries vast inequality like India, Philippines, Cambodia, Uruguay, Thailand able keep pandemic somewhat contained pretty significant spikes now. people living informal slums, little government support, inability get things delivered (I don‚Äôt think Amazon prime delivers Mumbai slums) diseases spread (220,000 people died tuberculosis India last year alone). Whether it‚Äôs variants previous measures able delay inevitable, places fewer resources going outbreaks we‚Äôve seen U.S places poverty lack resources get hit hardest. 

Couple medical system isn‚Äôt developed enough handle sick people it‚Äôs recipe disaster. Grandfather (96) Puerto Rico, I've following developments closely. Every time check Vaccinespotter, seem plenty appointments available, albeit may require drive. heck, island tiny, worst 3 hour ride. PR still rigid age restrictions place? would bad seriously equating net hair gloves hands drug FDA approved forcefully jected inside body?

I'm going argue illogical argument. reread original comment, included words DONT UNDERSTAND, asking explain something even comparable. Take care. Hard 1+ this. Somehow think things get better, don‚Äôt believe science you‚Äôre Satan.

The opposite true actually. greatly believe science.

Heck, even people dying old age sad. Times tough right hospitals. need elective surgeries people insurance come procedures. 

Requiring employees get vaccine could marketing win.  would time hair nets required, suddenly became required, right? dilemma would faced employers, right?

Alternatively, new requirement kitchen staff wear gloves. ruined? Yeah 50% death rate, medical knowledge medical technology advanced. really take consideration, OP right high death rate covid-19, would absolutely destroy society hundred years ago. Sadly western countries seeing happen countries like India Brazil gives way justify take seriously happen ""they low hygiene"" ""dense population"" etc... many people pick sympathy goes. 

It impactful saw pics mass burial NYC coffins Italy. 

Humans suck Yeah I'm call places area. time I'm two weeks, may care even less. Ofcourse! 
And also ok promote propose New meaning, go around insulting dismissing people biggots still use traditional common meaning word, 

time tell common usage future. sure always simple easy use word refer people's physical sex, right seem word common use man women, sure use male female, currently kind awkward use referring people, somehow expect say "" cis women trans men "" stick long.

Time tell, right using woman term refer persons female sex offensive anyone, ofcourse context matters could used offensive purposes. choice? spike protein eventually introduced, either via vaccine infection itself. fact, even vaccine, still could theoretically get sort long term consequences getting spike protein body Covid, no? (This theoretical). 58% cases week last.  Administered prick (not person), get vaccine are... Indeed, could. However, working office, would give carte blanche disclose health issue anyone walked door? happy vaccinated, wouldn't. main reason never know people react something like that. question Q-client would enraged knowing whole office vaccinated decide come shoot place picket vandalize it. office sensitive, even ask thing employees even asking would make people feel pressure consent.  consumable raw material supply chain pharmaceutical industry absolutely fucked Covid. US based Covid projects get priority everything else, suppliers guarantee lead times around 8-10 weeks per US government orders. Predictably leads massive ordering everyone else order make sure supplies business continuity. aren‚Äôt Covid project, you‚Äôre looking 6-8 months lead time least mixing bags, sterile filters, tubing assemblies, chromatography resin, etc., suppliers guaranteeing anything shorter 60 weeks. 

I‚Äôve talked department, we‚Äôre anticipating suppliers able resolve least another 2 years. Lol pure delusion. actually read india variant double mutation evade immune mutation. infecting younger killing younger. People talk waves. think going see true second wave new variant that's already detected multiple countries. Good luck get ready another lockdown /u/Temporary_Meat_7792 definitely get touch GP tell put waiting list nothing else. friend mine next risk group coming (but yet eligible theory) got first shot yesterday GP left over. Vaccines usually take least 5 years make ordinary times. 3 weeks reasonable timetable test get emergency approval condensed timeline caused pandemic. world can't wait dose intervals tested. example, Hepa B vaccines 6 months apart. Concerning Covid, results speak UK. given they're washable disposed they're showing wear. pisses people get defensive acknowledging this. shots, people angry FIVE percent given Spain inoculates *half* population also ridiculous. 

As US, yes would be. need look back 2 centuries ago either  Nah busy bashing countries , playing vaccine diplomacy &amp; cocky low rates transmission realising COVID doesn‚Äôt discriminate. Double mutation immune escape mutation. dont like blind pretend vaccines silver bullet everything going back normal  Doctors time....ANY drug kill someone.

Ever got anesthesia?

Better take piece wood teeth next time. dunno, Murphy seems pretty confident we'll hit 70% goal end June. idea avoid touching mask much possible, avoid adjusting/readjusting. put on, get set sealed, run errands, take done place hang it. taking off/putting back errands extra stress mask bands material, extra adjustments, extra opportunities cross-contaminate etc. I'm going go extra mile using N95/KN95/KF94/FFP2 I'm gonna properly.

Also use masks head bands ear loops lend better ""put take once"" strategy. Yay AZ again.

Minuscule side effects blown proportion. huge South Africa country. vaccine roll painfully slow got 30 million J&amp;J shots got put hold blood clots studied, therefore *known*. again, one dose Pfizer much, much better one dose J&amp;J... J&amp;J less protection moderate one dose Pfizer asymptomatic... Americans keep calling J&amp;J countries say Janssen? good chance vaccines effective one. (And time gets there‚Äôs good chance won‚Äôt many ways spread due people getting vaccinated also complete variants like UK vairiaint could make difficult become dominant.)  Side effects less severe second shot. Bit tired, bit nothing notable.

And wait say one went? Numbers matter. Even normal times percentage people outside miniscule. there? might want peruse /r/covidlonghaulers shame people take civic duty prevent spread. seen duty country global community. said elsewhere, I'm fine J&amp;J available people want convenience whatever reason, think game changer point given choice would probably opt ones.

Hell, it‚Äôs even complicated biologists virologists people studied stuff.

You cannot believe average Joe assess pandemic correctly. Forget that.

The problem politicians always agenda can‚Äôt really arsed unpopular things. Scientists recommend correct things don‚Äôt consider economic issues.

In doubt, listen scientists realized don‚Äôt groundwork argue them. pill raise clot risks, usually less dangerous ones legs etc. ones caused J&amp;J deadly kind. 

Also 1/600 what, annualized lifetime risk? That's directly comparable something happens within 1-2 weeks specific event. care 6 feet vs 60 feet. want know 6 feet better lesser number. sources back up? Good luck! live Bellevue myself, suburban lists lot closer me. Sigh, well least United States begin assisting countries. neighbor countries many others need. need demeaning bud. 

Likely doctor time, familiarity individual talk them. makes comfortable issue? design clinical trial. wanted trial short duration, high chance success. ran trial 2 doses, know 1 would enough. 

The dosage recommendations initially published were, match administered clinical trial. went look published dimensions space. 

The best found LA Times article [1] way back March last year. actually remarkable well people like Jose-Luis Jimenez Linsey Marr nailed year ago told story press, 2021 aerosol still controversial...

Anyhow best description I've found space this: ""Cushioned metal chairs extended six rows 20, foot chairs one aisle center. twice many seats people."" seen report index case was, reckoning, would make dimensions area 18'x50'.

Now, many ways, almost perfect worst case scenario aerosols. people singing nearly continuously. normal social interaction, people take turns talking, maybe person talking maybe 1/4 time, case singing way airflow lungs higher velocity. Add couple hour duration fact supposedly ventilation all.

That said, seem likely transmission beyond 20 feet. Still, objection original article stands say difference 6 feet 60 feet reasonable. totality evidence, matter far away, 60 feet lot safer 6 feet, 6 feet probably lot safer 2 feet.

The trouble risk communication usually magic numbers, things depend circumstances, hard communicate subtle things especially science fully certain.

That tag Priyanka Chopra. 

Also USA asking drug supply different cluster fuck complete entirety due Modi Government. 2nd wave India negligence, cockiness, inflated fragile egos central government. rape pogrom accused allowed form run governments happens. China doesn‚Äôt shut economy biggest festival little flu kills old people. 

Do people realize China‚Äôs addiction GDP? shut everything two months shit hit fan. Like massive amounts shit. see India. Obesity deadly COVID let‚Äôs talk it. saying RIP like 99% people don‚Äôt recover 1-4 days. Imagine living constant fear like yikes. never worried without vax never . Good luck taking shot every 6 months Every study uses different parameters. Truth single efficacy number - simplification.

But least studies agree - effective. staff members tested positive fully vaccinated, not. Rydland said since February, roughly 1% staff members fully vaccinated tested positive COVID-19, 7% staff unvaccinated tested positive timeframe. Howell said statewide, 60% long-term care facility staff received doses vaccine, number continuing important everyone needs vaccinated, people elderly high risk,"" said.

England get given turn medical centre, depending stock day. first jab Pfizer second one 13th May. Three weeks later I'll booking holiday somewhere British Isles, could happened without efforts developing vaccines. 'Hats them, said people invested money vaccines make happen. 

From read, German government funded trials development vaccine, must grating Germans know funded produced vaccine others reaped benefits have.

Anyway, well done Germany, 'always exceptional sphere science: going back centuries. It‚Äòs also spread via aerosols. means droplets floating around store while. Yeah. close border states local transmission. going come back U.S. going true second wave. learn waves really waves new covid 19 Indian variant spreads back U.S.

I'm worried like Jan 2020 China Indian reports new variant symptoms properly attained scientific data ‚Äúbureaucratic‚Äù - dosing regimens created scientific reasons bureaucratic reasons. argument based emotion opinion, science. Probably less would died future loss trust regulators paused examine situation. rapidly developed, even approved yet (emergency use authorization only). Caution good even slows things tiny bit, I'm saying someone that's fully vaxxed since Feb.

By argument, 400k American deaths could prevented skipped trials started mass injections last summer. reports get India. entirely new variant really bad different symptoms affecting younger population. worries like reading unknown virus spreading china killing people back Jan 2020 No. means 1 *20* chance. either/or, point. people want one done, others transient. lol. letting people in? J&amp;J huge developing nations, low income communities, rural areas poor logistics infrastructure. Considering describes **vast** majority US, pretty ironic they're ones likely reject AZ shown effective 12w delay 4w delay. Occasionally r/CoronavirusUK someone crops questioning take second appointment 8 weeks (I.e. doctor given 8w appointment want 12w appointment). even bothering bs? January last year remember pandemic cautious headlines, hard appreciate danger headlines always dramatic. mysterious outbreak China. Oh big deal, that's halfway across world. 

Weeks go by, story develops, gradually get cautious. think early March CDC said virus likely infect people - America, entire world. I'm good numbers, that's hit like train. Millions gonna die. I've whole year think feel like different person now, know describe it. joked co-worker earlier people get scared vaccine, effecting women maybe popular men. could call ""Johnson"" vaccine. Breathe area they're telling everyone 4 weeks, simpler logistics. point whole article. J&amp;J prevent deaths people got effective vaccines instead?

Only way greater good argument works people otherwise go unvaccinated. vague inappropriate statement, sure much research done subject...other say ""yes, everyones it, not?"" No..nobody ""require"" vaccine to. anything....why healthy college kid required take vaccine researched show long term side effects? Thats begginning barrel....what hhappens try shove beliefs throat millions people do.not agree that, you, anything like general? think people going ignore it, let pass? Things require fully vaccinated overlap much people shit together enough show second dose point.

Are homeless people going going international trips concerts? Remdesivir even HCQs needed. India exported nearly half administered doses Canada currently exported vaccines many small nations. No. government though endgame lifted restrictions, people partied went religious gatherings political campaigns, vaccines sent abroad vaccine producers begging government financial assistance plan rollout. 

And people suffering. family back it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating. seems define herd immunity local eradication, really strict use term. definition achieved herd immunity whooping cough either, still uncommon enough matter everyday life. hell thinks wearing mask worst part this? miss pizza parties work, find mask uncomfortable working high heat humidity. still times forget i'm even wearing one try shoving soda bottle masked face. It‚Äôs one shot instead two. Nobody ""needs"" things America. Moderna storage requirements really onerous, 1 dose MRNA us basically effective J&amp;J, hard come back second dose.

I'm J&amp;J approved available want point needed US, isn't. Supply exceeding demand even MRNA vaccines. CDC also said wear homemade masks beginning too. trust world health organization first facts. J J worth unless option forget Remdesivir exports India people US dying there. hope still remember. end 2020 became complacent, false confidence provided govt. too, went ahead poor vaccination plan, despite rising cases went huge political rallies, lockdown restriction place. (maybe now). Right vaccine production interrupted since raw materials USA stopped.

True, lockdowns end 2020, wouldnt caused spike way 4 months later. huge farmer protests late January. gatherings caused wave, would seen Delhi hit badly end February latest. nothing happened. 

It prevalent mutated strain hit India badly particularly younger people.  J&amp;J nothing may point US Pfizer supply exceeding demand many places date reported similar issues so, what's wrong avoiding J&amp;J another vaccine? Indian wave probably worst world seen 13 months teaches one thing country sees decline cannot get complacent claim cases went law abiding (and contrast country mock)

Even early march, saw number social media discussions India saw cases winter, common claim (from westerners Indians) Indians wearing masks else getting beaten up. Another Indians cared unlike ""selfish westerners"".

Both claims wrong, many parts India went back close normal winter cases low, parties etc took place. horrid phase number western countries inching back normalcy. 

Now, say India got hit partied November. mutation likely caused spike urban areas. 

If trying return normalcy caused spike, would seen way back December January bit selective interpretation, although largely agree premise. think saying rest world concerned number americans vaccinated, meanwhile also equally concerned rest world getting vaccinated. read saying two way street far virus concerned, number one concern Americans vaccinated. said, think classic case good politics necessarily equate good science. reality facts making international vaccination much bigger priority people unwilling get vaccinated. American exceptionalism really strong, context see countries behaving similarly. would way easy target politician sending vaccines abroad still people dying country Covid (no matter touch view may be). Remember time US dying begged Remdesivir exports India think twice. Fellow global citizen right? Fair enough. also believe Canadians vaccinated September. enough doses Canada mid July give everyone 2 doses. know EU stopped one export 250K Australia, link EU stopped anything NZ? far know NZ mainly getting Pfizer, single shipment Pfizer ever stopped leaving EU. rich considering fiasco vaccinating Stanford Medicine residents back December 65% reduction rate new infections, 65% efficacy. Sorry, elections important, government shit bed. Even now, interested election rallies West Bengal rather know, *governing*. nutty ignorant sounds, getting J&amp;J vaccine, I'm even risk demographic. worst embarrassing part is, work statistical models (not related health) still can't get passed cognitive dissonance. know would fine. know would healthy safe. But, can't bring it.

I'll probably get hated wanted share honest answer. I'll take licks come. blame Biden. Blame Trump. reason we're mess.

That said, no, hope normal life anytime soon officially dead. longshot. Again, yet vaccinate people. holding loosening restrictions like indoor masking sure enough people vaccinated. going forever.

Also, nobody said wear masks restrictions rest year even 2022. Dr. Fauci recently said even implying going happen. media twisted around words, that's what. He's promising we'll quickly, he's promising continued mask wearing social distancing 2022. Again, things change.

Giving right huge slap face everyone trying beat back virus trying end restrictions. Dr. Gottlieb said opinion. make true false. Chodiji probably opposite. Well yeah, studies. bound different results, fall percentage point. (unless full-proof 100%) Try /r/CoronavirusWA? listing places lots openings. still can't find one, there's good ""Seattle Vaccine Hunters"" group Facebook. Hopefully easier prevent wasted doses! similar world war 2 started...and am. talking Holocaust can‚Äôt find sources think, would think lots carefully designed trial data two dose regiment. know fact two doses effective safe.

Even though new research might suggest one dose regiment could provide similar efficacy, really reason US switch regiment, since little data effectiveness efficacy one dose regiment compared two dose regiment, benefit switching would provide would outweigh risks switching regiment large scale clinical data.

As Pfizer/BioNTech decided conduct study two dose regiment, beyond knowledge; hope someone experience immunology chime in. fairness redditors, individuals certain political stripe (I say mods) scream prime minister question period daily vaccines everyone would vaccinated right incompetent. 

So really blame people online confused. Yeah...

So strictly speaking metric talking ""vaccines administered cover X % population"".
But right, pretty close either way. That's ridiculous argument. condition employment specified new hire documents employee handbook. Yelling people common sense ridiculous comparison intelligent discussion.

A logical comparison would employer suddenly deciding fire everyone smokes. adults? Why? relatively small shipments coming piecemeal we're using.

In addition, vaccine effective prevention severe disease, elderly IFR matters. enough elderly taken vaccine, IFR drop significantly threat wanes.

So question becomes: good vaccine preventing spread virus. effective, highly effective. People still get sick still spread SARS-cov-2 vaccinated.

Would vaccination elderly fragile actually sufficient long term, given mutations exist? little data yet, seems (and many epidemiologists agree) vaccin protects us variants (due small genetic variation possibility spike protein).

Then mention patients. hospital talks staff, including administrative. argued people working directly fragile patients need protect themselves, argument cannot made accounting.

Finally, patient safety leading personal liberties, extend measures:

Yeah similar hopes :) That's *one* article. academia, quite common find research may contradict previous research. Critical thinking crucial component research. research uncovers several articles confirm theory social distancing substantially dramatically reduces risk:

So maybe supports nationalism suits you!!! trial showed vaccine prevented 95% symptomatic COVID cases, 95% got COVID mild symptoms. 5% get severe COVID, got symptomatic COVID. studied regimen used forgo saving lives 1-dose strategy.

It's sufficient look UK US see difference. number vaccines administered per 100 people, UK used many doses could first doses. result, UK epidemic mostly ended, US still much happening.

Since lockdown, forms public transport like trains restricted, migrant labourers make journey village cycling walking. 

Some could reach villages, actually died sun walking thousands kilometers. Many people left unmarked doubt people even got proper funeral families even got notified deaths.

This week, chief minister Delhi imposed 7 day lockdown city due rise cases. addressing this, literally pleaded migrant workers leave Delhi tried reassure lockdown seven days. Still, people started leave Delhi.

Imposing lockdown good everything, maximum middle class/upper class people might suffer pay cut/dent revenue. really case lower middle class/poor people probably working contract labourers, hawking vegetables, etc. affected most. unlike say, US Australia, people magically get thousand dollars month provided government(and think government afford anyways).

??? fucking wish also *extremely* misleading due nature elite college admissions.

Merely Googling ""school name"" + acceptance rate provide accurate number, people aware this.

Usually, data straight-up outdated, importantly, never seems take account vastly different (relatively) rates individual colleges, differences Regular Decision applicants vs Early Decision (ED applicants elite schools see percentage boost high mid-teens possibly low 20s), obviously, different ""standards"" applicants subject ""holistic"" approach elite college admissions. 

For example, Regular Decision Asian Male applying Arts Sciences statistically subject acceptance rate single digits. Meanwhile, Early Decision ""insert underrepresented race"" Female applying Engineering significant statistical boost admissions. Average two acceptance percentages get standard ""admission rate"".

I guess another example easy-to-digest statistics misleading and, case, serve comprehensive overview university. India exporting huge quantities vaccines countries vaccinating well allowed large gatherings politically popular. US's fault responsibility actions. 

While US good supply, needs maintain vaccinating second doses well kids (who likely qualify sometime summer.) tricky balance.

I also think better argument would US help Canada Mexico India. Canada Mexico heavily integrated American trade.

It's hard argue ""we need help XYZ country"" done helping country continent out.

Two hrs shot number two feel fine. Two hours first arm hurting + headache. would 100% fine wearing mask anytime went doctors/hospital future. ""Roaring 20's"" comparison sort stretch likely similarities: people traveling partying make lost time, many people stayed home and/or lived parents higher savings money spend, stock market likely well foreseeable future (or say...), etc...

Also, think people gained weight living recklessly, anything probably sedentary eating due stress. Substance abuse increased greatly, definitely correlated mental health effects pandemic, literally driving people crazy. definitely get point I'm glad improved course pandemic. Covid emerged 1918 suspect would even catastrophic H1N1.

No way. older population 1918 way small. Even without medical care, COVID mortality rate among people 20-40 nowhere near 0.5% 1918 first wave, much less 20% 1919 second wave.

On hand modern medical care, perhaps many would lived H1N1 pandemic. Death came almost entirely autoimmune overcompensation (cytokine storm), learned roughly one year ago pretty well treatable steroids. way we've contained COVID despite even sure big deal proves could done thing disease everyone would agreed big deal.  think US eventually big business going enter vaccination hesitancy arena. need pandemic number reasons tied economic health. eventually start ‚Äòencouraging‚Äô workforce perhaps even customers seek vaccinations see prolonged hesitancy. may succeed healthcare government failed.

I low level already see semi large corporation work for.  Learning Spanish, drinking unique beers me! India essentially took gamble save money. Instead paying $$$ order doses Pfizer/J&amp;J ect decided develop own. Looks like gamble turn them.

I know asymptomatic people long-term damage.

Vaccinated people asymptomatic; they're probably likely be, since vaccine reduces symptoms (if get infection all)

So: know long-term lung damage could still occur vaccinated people? I'm also drawing conclusions limited sample people know. people circle covid19 October. mild/asymptomatic cases. even fever, lack taste smell vague feeling unwell day two. live rural area one really took virus seriously except family. even wear masks matter what. sero survey. similar surveys showing high seropositivity Pune/Delhi. Consider people even make antibodies use cells clear virus. Unless provide evidence contrary, see I'm wrong right. Oh ok lol Good point. 

Maybe countries currently waiting list consider bribery since worked well us. hit now, 2009. H1N1 strain flu pandemic 1918. yes, much lower CFR. 2009 also getting World War. too! 180-ish 215-ish, 5'9"" male. Back 189lbs morning (Woo!)

Over COVID times, started baking macarons, banana muffins, donuts. still bake way pre-COVID, work whey Greek yogurt baking, destroying banana chocolate chip muffins bake (those good times though). anti-vaxx me. intend get vaccine offered stands today. also want make informed decision possibly can, keep reading I'm posting here. yes, reposted covid19 sub much bigger. simply wanted input people. got good replies, I'm happy. wife took time work lost significant amount weight. would amazing, excellent candidate!! hope US shares broadly neighbors. see article North Dakota vaccinating Canadian truck drivers. Yup, Indian variant (b 1.167) spread region (BC, Canada). safe everyone. Stay home, mask up, take first vaccine available! Nope. huge year ago.  lots rational people thought best way protect lose extra pounds get healthy possible.  instead worry every person wearing mask gained bunch weight well doesn‚Äôt seem rational it? Sure, would require depressed piece shit who‚Äôs trapped house full toddlers, lol commented earlier yes!!! access full kitchen stove day downfall. going office would eat granola bars lean cuisines dah every day. alcohol consumption went becuse home much would usually hours getting home work going bed filled running chores. Lucky. I'm going back gym week get second shot. impression Biden claimed US able vaccinate everyone using vaccines currently approved.

And Mexico, Canada, India, India likely return doses, loaned. like 85% us gained weight zip code, vaccination rates still 20% fully vaccinated appointments vaccine going unfilled. We're also fully open regardless whether safe not. I'm grateful I'm fully vaccinated. sure, lot changed aware things would never wanted aware of.

It prevent going grocery store want snicker. That‚Äôs perhaps good. don‚Äôt enough vaccines, they‚Äôre prioritizing older people people health concerns first. 

The people eligible vaccinations live 50+. R value certainly skyrocket last couple months. 0.8 decreasing daily cases close 1.5 based data. double contagiousness *if* ignore social behavior differences last months. Certainly least 50% faster spread. Scary af. day Health minister &amp; media channels promoted Coronil, understood over. agree , however could liscense cost sale literally every country right still make obscene profits. easy techonology adapt manufacturing processes wont setup night. mention raw materials used production probably already stretched thin companies currently producing mRNA vaccines. time countries begin production pfizer could already deliver hundreds millions doses .

To play devils advocate distributing vaccines quick possible, also breeding rise new variants. vaccines prove uneffective variant concern, gotta go papa Pfizer said shot within 100 days concerning variant. staggering amount money made letting virus run mutate.

If could stipulate vaccines must sold cost purely within borders. would make worth larger countries smaller countries would supplied Pfizer Moderna therefor equalizing playing field also distributing vaccines fast possible. don‚Äôt actually think places care you‚Äôre American not. know several families whose parents come India, example, get vaccine. people might like it, don‚Äôt particularly care people means come go get it. mean, could enforce that? Require immigration documents? wouldn‚Äôt feasible try based what? You‚Äôre green card holder vs visa holder vs undocumented? couldn‚Äôt. US exporting anyway. want population vaccinated also know reality people never get it. Kind puts damper things, huh Yes, still village level elections happening. Local candidates governing party r still trying bring crowd together win. fact assumed herd immunity achieved country billion plus case levels previously insane.

Hopefully found every American exclusive though :) numbers bad proximity India got big concern right now. says restrictions currently Eid situation worsens absolutely extend that.

Eid time lot families visit eachother eat meals together potentian catastrophe making Pakistan First time anyone convinced relax sphincter. Hell mess, I‚Äôm rolling it... 40/50+ sensible want careful think particularly current stage pandemic. guess Belgium reliant J&amp;J hence less impetus restrict good thing numbers go back J&amp;J shot authorized again. Fantastic. Every area tamps one less hotbed ""Variant Z"" pop up. 

Whatever nationality political leaning, crushing COVID one thing unite us. Sounds like mutation station creating resilient strains doctor mind. foolish, selfish. think average around 60. call ""very old"". Especially India, lots children teens dying well. Please stop spreading fake idea extremely old people die Covid, true.  2/3 apparently much milder forms illness, one showed limited reduction platelets. wonder clinical symptoms mild case, identical severe case least first? Usually much ritualistic event, family gathered, rites done body pyre. Usually done mass sites like nothing else burning bodies around them. scale unusual.

Sometimes see happening especially along Ganges (the ideal place Hindu cremated, believe) mass sites like this. horrifying Well get renegotiate contract. 

People request anything, new contract written signed, one anything. every 1M doses j&amp;j would result 2 these...

Two million. get 6k got add million 18-49 million 50+. sad thing damage already done. vaccine hesitancy already reaching wall states US government figure get enough people. enough lies, trolls, crap there, FDA pausing going put dent vaccine efforts.  also say lowering allow options want still option wait different vaccine. choice theirs. People snort powdered sugar counter grungy bars one bats eye. say give information choice. numbers paper look great you? I‚Äôve reading people big reaction first vaccine jab good probability already COVID. first shot like second dose vaccine people. source, official talk seen, people maybe already ‚Äòhave booster‚Äô getting second shot...that last part pure speculation part, math adds up. Also Spanish flu average age death 28 people die covid old. Hopefully beginning turn around Brazil. That's entirely true.

In India, case numbers rising rapidly among young adults. Something similar could happen here, already happening. news circulating around back might help coronavirus? think ended true, fairly large rumor least. Also accessible, India tens thousands extremely rural villages people illiterate. ever get vaccine. That's hundreds millions people high risk. Jeez I'm talking going year. mean general percentage people states, idea? link outdated irrelevant. Actual attendance nowhere near number. TIL 45 considered ""young""... think anyone complaining third shot, they're complaining fourth, fifth, or... well, get picture.

The reality situation virus going keep mutating forever. It'll slow eventually cases drop, never completely stop. places like India skyrocketing cases, vaccine-resistant strain bound appear eventually. 

The Coronavirus vaccine going fit role flu shot, like measles shot something. There's probably gonna new shot year, maybe every 6 months, vaccine producers little settle new rhythm, things start improve. done time. think next time could done 1918 even exist? passed another massive stimulus bill Well reported numbers low, know caused everybody get infected suddenly might virus vacine easy make.

We super lucky work don‚Äôt think read article. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs kind highly unacceptable country club restricted membership offer vaccine people literally queueing droves elsewhere. Nothing vaccine Brazil aplying 900 000+ doses since start month. Even though stupid president health minister, governors job public healthcare system also pretty good things.

Brazil, 1980, vaccinated 18 million people 1 day. purposely act like dick pick people worried trying safe ? Wtf wrong ?! Maldives second vaccinated country world 55% population üò® Seriously. Trust us say know bodies. real. bad news coming Brazil biased think ""those numbers probably made up/fake"".

Brazil's vaccine effort incredible undertaking. pity I'd heard randomly checking /r/coronavirus We‚Äôre definitely already. Way many cases Lol, thing now? People actually denying 1918 pandemic existed? got complacent Right saying it‚Äôs fully approved FDA incorrect statement. used misleading way sure though, like things. really alarming many people consume information daytime television news facebook feeds. going proportional math ratio dead population changed. take 1:1. study efficacy infections including asymptomatic, symptomatic infections, study elderly folks, study healthcare workers, cutoff (how many days vaccination infection happen) different. Throw different variants numbers quite varied. yes good. county one site know like 750,000 people?  Also, selected group. Healthcare workers much higher exposure average randomly selected trial participants. Obviously colloidal silver silverware Here‚Äôs study effectiveness. want see transmission rates look 7 day moving average.

No, beg every lawmaker US pave way resumption increased export vaccines raw materials rest world. Thanks. Unfortunately I've rejected top choices already, I'm still running one them. Trying lose hope yet. alternative AZ vaccine, sure potentially exposed covid worse. alternative AZ waiting mRNA vaccine couple weeks, suddenly becomes different risk calculation. Personally think ending covid earlier enough vaccinate groups AZ, understand health authorities individuals think differently. period week late first dose Pfizer week early second dose...and still going three weeks later. :( said that, I'm 48 share random weird cycles last years, knows. Currently supply still limiting factor. 97.4% doses delivered last Monday used. priority rules limiting factor. enough vaccine available vaccinations open everyone. case vaccinating people priority still makes lot sense. 

0.6% population vaccinated given day. Yesterday half million doses adminstered. getting vaccine people? vaccines arriving.

I'd much prefer different government, totally ""fuck up"" everything. vaccination campaign 1 month behind US catching up. Things could better. getting millions people vaccinated one year start pandemic still much faster anybody anticipated.

I sorry people wait appointments, example father got vaccine 3 days age bracket became elligible vaccinations. 

Please wait weeks. Things get better soon. pandemic topic september elections. Taiwan good run fair üòî Please speculate leads vaccine hesitancy Giving vaccines india moment saves lives give vaccine young americans kind logic needs adjustment vaccinations foreigners... huge influx people world getting vaccines US. anyone seen estimates big might be? problem data doesn‚Äôt account generally rural populations less access healthcare.

Only time next pandemic long lower guard think repeat this. Reality they're basically equally safe consider everything. Lots countries luxury choosing vaccines. offense but
in opinion vaccine shopping thing country gets point, export doses people willing line it. tell something know Hydrate, drink beet juice, take Aspirin leading day shot. get clot, there's bigger issues going inside body.

Fuck Reddit hive mind talking general, USA sub Interesting. Looks like right. ""make goal July 4th drop masks social distancing get back normal life"".

youre dreaming think that's ever possible. Almost every expert says covid stay. shit. No, AstraZeneca J&amp;J do, example. However, live active virus conventional sense, still wrong shedding BS :) believe study drug releasing general population. E.G. usually legal conduct stage 3 trials stage 2 trials stage 2 meant make sure safe give stage 3 participants, emergency authorisation. AFAIK data gathered time authorisation granted - safety checks getting data first place. yea they're vaccine available, makes j&amp;j worth it. Yikes! unknown long term effects. 100% children one study biomarkers blood vessel damage post covid. included asympto mild cases. people definitely died pause.

Yea, nearly enough make population increase. Skeptic thinks, convenient big Pharma companies 

Anyone got information contrary? Much worse knowing AZ vaccine provides poor protection it,

Citation needed.

And ""antibody response"" citation totally ignores t-cells. high risk group side effects vaccine. risk small results, however I'm willing take risk moment. may change future. Perhaps, case actually undercount cases much then, first wave. also doubt every country trouble beginning. Human population still increasing I‚Äôd say definitely winning. Ban export vax ban flights. Govt smart. Nah. Eventually catch covid enough times suffer enough til self preservation overcomes stupidity force get vaccinated.

You nothing worry American get second shot survive 3 weeks. 

Keep wearing masks lower viral load possibility. Stick outdoor activities. Concerts probably still aren‚Äôt good idea while.  Please Indian govt. pre order this. 

The main issue Pfizer storage transportation. that‚Äôs sorted please love god procure would save lot lives looking current state covid one last 5 states move full eligibility 4-19 though. It‚Äôs airborne. actively denying reality justify loose restrictions. na√Øve, matter gets voted in, result same, America America ONLY.

Only stupid nation would would vaccinate people first helping others.

Other wise nation would inevitably face outbreak infects tens millions citizen beg help.

It still rule jungle among international community, strong thrives, weak dies.

It is, take personal. Mine ROUGH 24 hours. fortunate! think involved study. 34 male, know illness, vegan, rarely drank alcohol, smoking, exercised daily. 

I got 2nd dose Pfizer late February. week later started heart rate jump 170 randomly daily. Went ER, hospital, ecgs, ekgs, stress test coming back normal. Got PCR tested covid, negative. 

I‚Äôm still dealing even although extreme heart rate isn‚Äôt often symptoms physical, mimic panic attack, mental worrying. 

I‚Äôve never panic attack life since vaccines body constant state attack.

Still happy vaccine damn, I‚Äôm hoping return normal sometime soon. layman, feel like every article different efficacy percent. They‚Äôre good, make go, ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt read percent day?‚Äù Care explain hangs air 20 min outside? Even .5 mph breeze...it‚Äôll blow away UV-C effective job, can't penetrate atmosphere. makes outside much safer virus disperses 3D breeze even still conditions diffuses disperses.

Which brings us back study hand. Good ventilation makes buildings get fat outside

How outside protect inside? still completely trivial get appointment Boston area. willing drive hour find something relatively easily everybody luxury. remember year ago hearing vaccine that‚Äôs 60% effective would par vaccines flu vax would amazing accomplishment develop one year. 

We develop vaccine that‚Äôs 95% effective less year, surpassing expectations. we‚Äôre finding might ‚Äúonly‚Äù 80% effective variants doomsdayers losing minds saying need lock forever variants. right thing investigating risk assessment. didn‚Äôt anything imagine outcry? people would loose even faith. give people agency decisions cannot make them. J&amp;J vaccine I‚Äôd to. Anyone see gross Black Angus ad middle that? I'm young woman would take J&amp;J vaccine. Main reason single dose vaccine.

EDIT: understand math extend miniscule blood clot risk scare me. I'm likely get hit car way get vaccinated. get fat outside fine that's I'm getting at

UV kills BLM protest last year would caused massive explosion cases fast live Pune even busy area, still hear ambulances couple times day. along police patrols evening make ""dystopian apocalyptic future"" asthetic really fun in. condition country horrifying. lot people don‚Äôt realize vaccines still emergency use authorization. don‚Äôt know long term adverse effects, simply because, well, haven‚Äôt enough time observe them. Going science it‚Äôs unlikely would be, course we‚Äôve wrong before.

I‚Äôd say risk getting covid probably higher anything vaccines, people allowed encouraged make informed judgments. covid weeks ago getting moderna shot days. 

I'm scared side effects gonna fuck up. Latest research posted 50% deaths extreme cases obese, compared 42.5% general population obese.

22% extreme cases deaths normal weight, compared 27% US population normal weight. 

So effect, huge.

Don't know changing subject. Well yeah, benefit hindsight. enough foresight seek vaccine 3 weeks ago. 

But people already edge, pause help bring in. 

Testimonies like help. people don‚Äôt blow blood clot risk proportion. People looking efficacy numbers trial without understanding different contexts numbers recorded. definitely frustrated somebody got J&amp;J couple weeks ago - pick (vaccine type known showed clinic) happy get move life. Sometimes feels like people talk based vaccine type got incredibly frustrating stupid. First shot plus two weeks supposed 80-90% efficacy. Israel's data showed like 60% first dose.

The second shot pushes 95% probably adds duration protection. basically vaccine ""Nationalism"". think it‚Äôs okay there‚Äôs warning label. J&amp;J vaccine would fucking to. Same. Everyone talking side effects feels exactly covid me, except lasted whole two weeks. back painful and, like said, fire days. weird. try focus 99.99% safe, 0.01% risk humans shown terrible evaluating risk.

*Gun control debate enters chat* I‚Äôm sorry hear.. No. Shit. theory would great news Von der Leyen came announced 1+1=2, would skeptical. I‚Äôll believe July time line happens.

Anyway people group (70+) getting appointments end May don‚Äôt see it‚Äôs possible get priority group three significant chunk group four one month. Unless course start group three May really don‚Äôt think happen since they‚Äôre scheduling group two far out. 

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong point confidence German COVID strategy less number new cases Australia. also lot supportive mask use number commenters theoretical model quantifies extent transmission risk reduced large rooms high air exchange rates, increased vigorous respiratory activities, dramatically reduced use face masks. actually honest data percentage deaths extreme cases obese people? It‚Äôs B decision though. vaccines don‚Äôt issues (and funnily enough might offer better protection first dose compared J&amp;J‚Äôs ‚Äúone-and-done‚Äù thing).  seems WAY coincidental short, light period past 20 years life... periods getting Pfizer, suddenly became much, much heavier longer. actual cycle also shorter, periods every 3 weeks instead 4.

Oh live got older Log cabin Republicans scaring younger LGBT point article first hand experience HRT Pfizer shot HIV+ friend Pfizer shot. think there'll eventually nuance, right now, think takeaway still simple: Many us exactly one vaccine actually available us, even weeks available, that's *long* time let virus run rampant.

Plus, poster said: J&amp;J logistically *much* easier. Depending live, might waiting long time infrastructure able keep mRNA vaccines cold enough long enough. Or, trying vaccinate homeless camp, may *much* harder get people show second dose two-dose version.

It's really absurd sense self-entitlement, honestly.

I hope vaccine companies get every single cent can. deserve it, fuck does? That's mostly true, people vaccine-hesitant often nervous those.

Meanwhile mom dad still go work everyday. countries specific subs though /r/India far active /r/CoronavirusIndia terms COVID. 

If really want info India look regional tweets there. hang vaccinated people.. That's plan. crazy thing seem understand concept perfectly, except one direction. US interest see Americans vaccinated; interests rest world see Americans vaccinated, point Secretary (of State Antony Blinken) made repeatedly long virus spreading anywhere, threat people everywhere. long virus spreading uncontrolled country, mutate travel beyond borders. That, turn, poses threat well beyond United States,"" Price said responses questions. referring original article literally blamed ""women nervous getting vaccine"". Yes, Netherlands vaccinating 60-64 year olds AstraZeneca. Currently 66 67 year olds (older age groups mostly done) mostly Pfizer started inviting 65 year olds. course elderly medically high risk chance vaccinate deadlier (with AstraZeneca). High risk groups 60 also vaccinated Pfizer/Moderna Janssen.

Not lot left AstraZeneca.

The next group invited 50-59 year olds medical risk group. Invitations shld probably start somewhere next two weeks. Iceland 29 deaths 4 patients serious condition. They‚Äôre better Norway. guarantee manufacturers level success another type variant virus time.

Not hoping repeat lifetime next time need order enough vaccinate Europe every serious vaccine manufacturer provide funding needed.

The cost associated lockdowns economy pause dwarf almost vaccine expenditure even delay weeks. end vaccine need great, give away developing countries. We're mess time takes everybody get vaccinated likely new mutation arrive gain enough speed spread faster vaccines able catch up. wish simple allowing nature sort out, not. pose clear present risk people physically unable vaccinate due medical conditions, children, creating possibility dangerous variant evade vaccines. Oh, definitely is. Whatsapp forwards cast doubt vaccines pretty widespread. huge chore fighting past doubts convincing people. use different vaccine? areas US don‚Äôt access Phizer Moderna? take even minuscule risk options available? 2nd Moderna shot took lol dont like idea 3rd possibly WORSE like idea booster shot making feel way 36hrs BUT, realize cause suck buttercup haha  Sweden borrowed 200 000 doses Norway. give em 65+. nearly vaccinated (who wants it) within coming weeks. counties working 60-64 years old moment first shot. peer review study done that, observations could easily confounded variables? Awesome! I'm getting second one next week. exciting. :) cases deaths plummet, leadership run excuses. easier solution. Make mandatory air travel, period. refuse people boarding basically anything stands. vaccines? Make inconvenient vaccinated. I'm tired seeing rhetoric sub honestly know point posts like are? think getting side effects makes morally superior? People claim lying? fault hydrated windmills? enjoy smug? Yes, Norway Denmark even extreme. everyone vaccinated beginning July still seems possible due increased Pfizer deliveries. That‚Äôs looking for. Everybody talks risk reward nobody talks numbers would apply European countries age restrictions AZ vaccine. Well. odds young person dying Covid...? Exactly Basically think mid-May AstraZeneca needed anymore, eligible people (60+) needing vaccine. second doses needed. Also, many vaccines suppliers then, think demand need vaccine extremely low (if would eligible age groups left, be). assume give doses away poorer countries. Well, that's nature reality? Americans really want convenient magic pill, guess what? That's reality (and hence real life) works. Giving concrete answer something uncertain conclusion actually worse given above, lots people take stick steadfastly due unwillingness see sometimes facts ground constantly changing. Eh. see you‚Äôre saying little dramatic. idiots since man began socially evolving. don‚Äôt think anti maskers deniers Spanish flu? did. 

Every pandemic we‚Äôve gotten species stupid people delay end date still came. Calculated risk applies cobbled together vaccines covid itself? Holy fuckin shit. usa, Yes. half adults USA received least one vaccine dose evenly distributed among communities communities plateauing 25% doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúhave be‚Äù - vaccine rollout botched people ‚Äúassuming‚Äù things ‚Äúalright do‚Äù based supposed science... course UNSCIENTIFIC

We're waiting public health give us okay. think alright.‚Äù Last line kills ü§£ nurse neighbor worked COVID unit height pandemic Minneapolis. Everyone unit wore full PAPR system.

Death toll number fudging something that's happening even non BJP ruled states.

Well, Kumbh Mela tho, that's fucking BJP tho. question. received vaccine due fact COVID December tested antibodies March. punished even though antibodies don‚Äôt even need shot protect myself? Sorry rough day. someone pointing everyone bad side effects (maybe provide hope? Perspective? Encouragement?) seems pointless you, pass by. charge. Stay safe, friend. banning travel country unless vaccinated. Ah. literally case ""We fucking told so!"" nation level. New York State made live, work, study New York eligible vaccine. eligible.

But worth shot anyway - maybe ask care. fact vaccines haven‚Äôt approved FDA?  Austin Powers: ""Is me, smell like sh.t...?""

Basil: ""It sh.t, Austin!""

Austin Powers: ""Oh... then..."" (Drinks)

Austin Powers: ""...It's bit nutty..."" Could so, yes. would lot factors would super different time 1300s Europe well. would fun think through. really, global pandemics like covid possible time. enough global travel trade, human population less dense probably younger, also little medical technology understanding germs, destroying environment ways create kinds viruses...lots factors! true. Well constitutes old, fact matter average age 80, can't make 38% deaths give take. average age death US closer 68. We've 768,000 deaths far add together. suppose anybody older 55-ish really know, making point existing requirements vs non existing requirements. ... pin-prick hope West. info info wars? 3-4 weeks manufacturer recommendation. data shows window stretched 16 weeks still effective. Yeah, I'm UK masked April remember funny looks well. reading early reports covid causes blood clots fact blood thinners clotting disorders nearly died four years ago pulmonary embolism really put fear me. Fortunately already live pretty isolated socially distanced life. second Pfizer jab today feeling relieved, 71 year old mum got second last week too. I'm actually intending mask winter rest life. feels like right thing now. US needs step here. 
 
cmon, let's get big hats help planet like used to.
 
all people claiming want make america great, chance put money mouth is. Bro N95s gone mid January. looking first weeks month news story broke January 3rd. sold 7th getting new shipment next week. Instantly gone someone hoarding stores area. Ended getting girlfriend‚Äôs father works field they‚Äôre abundant. crazy. crazy me. state live used report contact tracing data online restaurants/bars like tiniest tiniest fraction infections. stopped reporting data around December, remember big ones hospitals, warehouses, generic catch like ‚Äúprivate gatherings‚Äù something. Schools weren‚Äôt even list. funny paper shows reduction capacity classroom caused six feet rule actually helping reduce spread models.

His models show reducing occupancy room one form risk reduction. using example. think CDC honest number people diagnosed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). 

We created new imaging protocol work diagnosis this. throwaway want violate companies social media policies. rare, rare CDC says. didn‚Äôt say that. know fact people sitting right next outside hugging didn‚Äôt infect other? That‚Äôs everyone else thought, really lend expertise CDC. really banning travel, ""recommending"" anything. We've seen well people follow recommendations. sorry, USA gun culture never said mutate more. also mutate less

It's vaccine remain vigilant.

I think like multi-sided die. need stop giving Covid many rolls hopes gets weaker, guarantees understand correctly, PAH take years develop. that's case may know long time people develop issue vaccines not. They're misinterpreting assumption research paper ""well-mixed room"" focused situation infectious aerosols reaching homogenous concentration air faster events. funny assumption starting point paper, gives recommendations room ventilation limits population density residence time rooms using assumption. expected part equation, going outliers mitigating part process, Ontario ltc residents get delayed second doses. entire process fundamentally utilitarian, be. I‚Äôm saying ban cars. I‚Äôm saying require working brakes turn signals. hair nets before? restaurant already require hair nets days? actually covid death rates far higher reported, death rates suitable medical intervention available.  still gonna win next general election, sure simply rhetoric people vote overwhelming majority. hopeless. NEW DELHI ‚Äî India‚Äôs coronavirus second wave rapidly sliding devastating crisis, hospitals unbearably full, oxygen supplies running low, desperate people dying line waiting see doctors ‚Äî mounting evidence actual death toll far higher officially reported. 

Cough cough Kejriwal barely setting PSA plants since January funds given making scene right pleading Centre bring Oxygen gaining sympathy it.  India harsh brutal lockdown enforced police.

They reopened even cases rising proceeds allow events thousand snd even hundreds thousands people. probably will, always get Sputnik! hospitals place staff members working year without getting covid careful use PPE. guess N95s eye protection work pretty well think said around 6% asymptomatic  fair also way people alive nowadays. dont blame US government fault instead looking India went help nations. anything Myocarditis cases reported Israel? 
If issues, would seen now?   goes trip Afghanistan üòî I‚Äôve learned anything last year, it‚Äôs people sure love pointing finger anyone else themselves. political. actually people dying due covid. dying due lack oxygen due poor infrastructure shit government prepare shit even first wave preceded.There oygen left patients run restaurant new requirement comes kitchen staff must wear hair nets, employees refuse contract, guess I'm ruined then, I? Yeah, genie bottle. chance completely eradicating going long term. Like small pox, took years years get controlled. better tool now, specifically short time line mrna vax's. deniers us favors. thank you. never knew mechanism today. find behind-the-paywall links! MUHAHAHAHAHAHA-ahem. sorry. Post mortem examinations covid patients shown evidence PAH. article say vaccines cause side effects, call action investigate vaccines carry risk since create spike proteins. But...children get it? I'm sure development. favorite local news comment section meme ""30 million deaths bacterial pneumonia caused masks"" r still busy manipulation &amp; finding others blame via media. Looking scapegoat Glad miss appointments.  research article makes assumption ""well mixed room"" entire physical modeling based assumption. well-mixed environment going rapidly reach constant concentration airborne viral particles entire area.

The research article also provides evidence case studies justify assumption, descriptions physical system, well caveats reflected interview CNBC.

So yeah. experimental proof *per se* physical model well-mixed room would look like coupled justification well-mixed assumption valid. idea got it. Feeling little good far. know like territories, states government started begging people actually get vaccinated. Mass vaccination sites shutting walk-ins becoming norm, even urban areas (rural areas begging people get vaccinated weeks ago). plenty vaccines available, distribution equal.

I also doubt they're going Puerto Rico sounds like vaccines hard find Texas spent last month vaccinating people state Texans want it. go least 2-3 times week. 4 kids use fresh foods like milk apples pretty fast. enough space fridge store week's worth milk family! Especially they're home day cause school online now. hang computers, guzzling milk.... Actually, adequate fat stores help survival hunter/gatherer age. could last lean times likely pass genes on. Trouble today, abundance food lack regular exercise, fat stores attraction sweet, unhealthy foods led obesity crisis (mostly driven corporate interests like McDs Coca Cola). blame solely lie individual ‚Äòlack willpower‚Äô. AZ J&amp;J non profit. Pfizer Moderna profit. math. know access vaccines. I'm betting J&amp;J shot one available, able overcome fears get it. &amp;#x200B;

 

he virus mutates quickly current strain infectious. main reason deaths due lack O2 supply. Also lack preventive measures taken first wave preceded. Everyone dropped guard roaming around without masks.Election ralies mass religious gatherings held led huge outbreak I'm group 3 Germany got first shot morning vaccination center. hundreds people across ages, notably old people. got 2nd Pfizer yesterday, I'm same. feels like got punched arm, first time. even annoying enough take ibuprofen acetaminophen. 

A tiny price pay benefits bestowed. Well damn. stand corrected. thought remembered hearing super obese back virus mutates quickly current strain infectious. main reason deaths due lack O2 supply. Also lack preventive measures taken first wave preceded. Everyone dropped guard roaming around without masks.Election ralies mass religious gatherings held led huge outbreak Yes, atleast HC puppet fake manipulation relieving. Hope stays same. Big laud HC Yes, statistics people get *different* vaccine instead JNJ vax? seems like obvious choice. mean, compare fact deadly pandemics, completely different far viruses go.

Comparison Spanish flu mostly number people killed. Considering number unreported deaths, likely already 6 millions probably reach 10 millions over. Going numbers got killed places like Bergamo last Spring, safe assume without lockdowns without level health care today, Covid could killed Spanish flu. thing thrombocytopenia also occurred adverse reaction Pfizer Moderna vaccines too.

Data EMA Europe numbers thromboses thrombocytopenia covid vaccine:

AstraZeneca - 142 16 million

Pfizer/Biontech - 11 59 million

Moderna - 2 5.2 million Possible explanation sub turned pretty sharply favor reopening lifting mask mandates past weeks: 
 
I'm (almost) fully vaccinated, everybody care about. COVID virus longer affects life. affect life, significantly, government policy social attitudes *around* COVID. that's really care now, imagine lot Americans starting feel vaccinations ramped up.  Correct. Vaccines slow spread, make virus mutate more. J&amp;J don‚Äôt think read question entirety. I‚Äôm agreeing highlighting importance current measures taken also pondering endgame measures longer necessary. Hope help us get mildly. 

Good chance that. Besides helping reduce chances infected, bolstered immunity helps fight without symptoms getting severe. pretty self explanatory. idea children continue masking protect adults protect approaching absurdity. OK, said contain mRNA produce full length spike protein. Sorry that, english first language. Pfizer 2 vaccine candidates: BNT162b1 BNT162b2. first one encode full length protein, studies side effects. opted go BNT162b2 encode full length protein. vaccine use today. Words also change meaning time. speaking people India late last year. people recovering Covid, many several family members die already. could hear election crowds background. 

This awful last year already. hell earth. ...wut? Freedom? freedom? 

If go surgery, expect surgeon wash hands operating. go eat restaurant, expect chef clean wearing appropriate attire. get taxi, expect driver driving licence. customer, absolutely expect compliance reasonable demands job. employer absolutely demand employees carrying service comply. Certainly worrisome critical explored further, full transparency.

That said, article title seems imply possible long-term effects spike protein stem vaccines, would expect effects from, know, virus itself? so, piece context matters. Wish case upcoming summer youth program.. still required wear even though fully vaccinated staff. Better learn read. long run. study defines little differently often examining different populations people exposed potentially different strains COVID. Also, news media like report confidence intervals, actual study may conclude vaccine's efficacy 80-90% another concludes 77-85%, they're reported 85% 81% media sources despite statistically indistinguishable. Vaccine demand dropping fast. live, PA, still 4000 cases day. declining? Yes. safe yet? really. seeing rise cases children. truly understand people put wear piece clothe mouths. Yeah foresee variant impacts children more. Viruses evolve spread faster track. good point. probably corona sort violent, nebulizer week, whole deal, got smoking someone‚Äôs blunt state fair, never again, proceed tell they‚Äôve sick hours I‚Äôm woman second dose (Moderna) two days ago. side effects all, even sore arm. windmills after, stay hydrated. Hopefully won‚Äôt bad. 346,000 cases 2600 deaths sure require vaccines already. Altavista way go. Many states (including Texas) 'at will' actually terminate change conditions employment time reason. right? Debatable. Certainly legal though. also enough fully vaccinate everyone end July. Pfizer deliveries well 100M June, July August.  J&amp;J use Chimpanzee adenovirus.

No J&amp;J **does not** use chimp adenovirus. AZ does.

 uses human fetal cells. would pissed staff old age home taking care aunt get vaccine eventually - find another job problem it. also general age limit BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba. Quebec 45 believe. said anti-vaxxers. meant hesitant. EU exported least 39.2M doses Japan EU exported least 39.2M doses Japan Idk didn‚Äôt advise people get both? realize there‚Äôs waiting period, right?  vaccine works they‚Äôve seen strain Cali it‚Äôs something panic about. could also call local health department requesting info admin J&amp;J. makes feel better gf got moderna didnt even feel needle either time, later pain injection site expected though. actually gave shot bandage couldn‚Äôt even properly see go in. Ahh ok. got now. makes sense 50% words actual words.

Thank translating. kind sounds like would cast system, no? People get vaccine vs people can‚Äôt get religious reasons, genetic issues. genetic disorder makes little concerned since typical mRNA atypical could affect me. live healthy life.

I think optics getting rest world vaccinated anything else.

The US might use J&amp;J people hate needles, homeless, prison populations, people aren‚Äôt mobile need house calls.

India rest world need vaccines desperately. Soon FDA grant full approval moderna Pfizer. see many places require vaccination entry. Schools businesses restaurants airports name it.

It‚Äôs way. PA. Yeah literally idea they're trying say lmao Depends age they're 0 risk of. zero risk long COVID teens, know anything long term risks. everything women victimized. Learn body works... menstrual cycles actually change response sorts bodily changes. It‚Äôs finely tuned system extremely sensitive. Doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs problem... opposite, actually. often, different period usual cause concern. 

As women get vaccinated, vaccine makers better data actual problems (eg interferes birth control, that‚Äôs definitely something women need know.) don‚Äôt want women bad outcomes- that‚Äôs terrible business. Profit motivation... that‚Äôs capitalism. isn‚Äôt misogyny- don‚Äôt warm fuzzy feelings men either. US trying achieve herd immunity order open up. Without virus continue circulate mutate Agreed, conditions required employment, spelled time emploent offer made accepted. add vaccine requirement already worked sound right me. Also, yes vaccines required school, something parents agree placing child school. Isn‚Äôt India extremely obese too? mean, realistically, could vaccines interact? result spike proteins exposed immune system learns them, using different mechanisms.

I felt like shit day Pfizer #1, first clue get J&amp;J placebo, obviously already sensitive spike protein produced big ol' immune reaction. J&amp;J sold contaminated powder. reputation hurdles overcome.

6 feet beyond poorly ventilated environment mask high risk. Getting rid people refuse get safe, effective vaccine could dangerous patients seems proportionate.

I‚Äôm tired whole time bars restaurants schools hid behind ‚Äúbut we‚Äôre 6 feet apart! there‚Äôs way could spreading here!‚Äù guidelines ever promoted actual safety responsibility. wearing masks far eradicated flu, flu spreadability nothing like covid's   upside beyond saving deaths FUCKING GET LIVES BACK.
 
 That's terrible, terrible way phrase it. stick ""saving deaths"" part, even I- someone who's fully vaccinated like six weeks now, who's worn mask indoors 13 months now- hear say ""Fuck dude, get life back whenever want, government decide me."" woman 50 concerned,

ask doctor. Sore arm, little tired dose Moderna. 

You see side effects reported clinical trial shows plenty people significant ""feel like shit"" side effects. would stop 180% particles. Pretty good odds me.  guidelines CDC website, I'm following. Neither 2 dead men 30, oddly enough like anti-5G tinfoil shielding front windows, tho'

Nothing says ""rational thoughtful response"" quite well.

This clickbait / trash / newsOfTheStupid item. *shrug*

You're one said ""you can't force people take vaccines"". wanna amend something else feel free. Wait like feb? Woah Um baby power u probly used causing cancer. Lol j j disney.  starts? ""aNeCdOtEs DATA!11!!11"" 


but same. know several people died, advanced age. also know several people severe complications die, also advanced age. also know many young people (under 40) infected 6+ months ago seem totally fine... among even organs checked fear.  


It's true, anecdotes data... data seems indicate long covid pretty rare.   Go hug someone, dude. incremental additional risk outweighed boost mental health. meant physical stress body. I'm calling women hysterical. Well seems like enforceable rule definitely empty political statement  "" Alison Thompson, public health ethicist University Toronto says believes misunderstanding nature mRNA vaccines.

It lower immunity, worse, ineffective variants.
Longer wait doses.

Which btw, _possibility_ contracting_, certainty, since get jabbed.

Source statistics btw.
If read carefully actually 2 cases/100000 age group, thus towards 1/50000.

I'm feeling political agenda here.
Don't want conspiracy theorist, numbers literally Lmao learn anything past year I'm arguing point. I'm simply saying believe laws different EUA vaccines fully approved vaccines like flu vaccine, believe employers REQUIRE employees get covid vaccines fully approved. That's hospitals etc. see huge upswing vaccinations employers allowed mandate point. (and I'm pro-vaccine looking forward point) concept diverse portfolio different types vaccines. going work better others. mRNA vaccines wide use first time, sense got lucky - least tried technology turned successful. J&amp;J work something?  mean around 5,000,000 deaths, sounds way line reality. thank correction. ""recall"" nothing, however put hold. sit 1400 doses ready go, unable give due side effects clotting causing.  

I'm going sit argue vaccine detrimental everyone's health and/or avoided. based research data, new still clue cause. pure science behind amazing, also still rushed properly trialed due necessity.  

I seen far hospitalized due COIVD vaccine, also seen many placed back hospital due vaccine let's act like miracle drug. agree. Moderna Pfizer making booster shots? That's really selfish point view. risks minuscule dying vaccine comparison covid still worth even younger. point really you. protecting people immunocompromised idiots get vaccine general. Yeah might affect men. Male honestly know bothers concerned blood clots impacts everyone. I'm sorry one made bigger deal made better... Yet. I'm hopeful things like coming light address fix it. families pay wedding rich they'll splurge obscene amounts money show well are. places, bride's family supposed pay everything including expensive gifts groom family bride's family well sure become burden. old days used called dowry orthodox families still believe customs even though might explicit before. care less 6 vs 60 6 vs 3. Yeah original decision puzzling. 0.0013% chance someone mostly treatable side affect enough pause it. Meanwhile there‚Äôs Oxy clinics every city guaranteed harm several people one even gives fuck. Anti depressants help feel good, also make kill yourself, seems ok ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

I get caution, sure seemed excessive. reputation AZ J&amp;J vaccines cannot repaired matter many politicians get them. almost Fox news belittled virus get go. Airborne suspected/proven outcome that. floats. initial night clubs, ski lodges, ships airports got infected. 

I've working duration pandemic essential in-person facility (not healthcare ) public health guidelines airborne threat. Room capacity limits (headcount, sq. ft. based), room logging, mask required times regardless distance, anything non-essential building shut including front door, meetings virtual. Mandatory symptom / health logging everyone building rooms rearranged two anywhere near other. 

We're worried coughed on. Anyone cough even allowed premises, regardless reason. got first jab. Yea think pretty unlikely either case honest. something like 24,000 people died covid last year morbidity very, small number 30. average morbidities like 4 per covid death. Old sick really look statistics.

A coin toss really, unless recognize know long term effects vaccines. faith anything, bit different personally suppose. Unlikely. doctor asking anyone break law, he's (presumably) breaking company policy, discrimination, bunch reasons. contract really specific state laws getting wrongful termination lawsuit ground going hard. shocked employment lawyers looking spin ""employee refused vaccine fired, illegal because..."" could reflection human behavior. effictiveness least 10 days first shot, perhaps people begin take risks there‚Äôs actually scientifically proven connection. risk may small, can‚Äôt say there‚Äôs connection. That's exactly I'm experiencing right now, two weeks two days J&amp;J. totally convinced vaccine-related, interesting hear. Hopefully seems failure messaging. seemingly lot jurisdictions planning keeping measures place well majority population vaccinated. hard see people living areas, see connection two, government enforcing orders promised that. super confusing though, point 6 feet threshold, looking difference 6 feet *less*? Like, 6 feet better 3 feet, point. aint transport liquid form? Why? Yep, I‚Äôm aware, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm going back normal now. I‚Äôm danger anybody I‚Äôve fulfilled obligation, continue forward would make people feel better emotionally rather scientifically.   Yes Hope you‚Äôre right, definitely see pushing back b/c sub 16yos don‚Äôt vaccine, sadly think students would contempt restrictions single case covid planet .
Praying I‚Äôm wrong. Maybe US start ""one dose good enough"" campaign vaccine-apathetic. Technically correct sir u/ButtScientist69, think speaking general terms. Well, remark concerned RT's yes, anti-vax nurses. I've heard outrageous reasons getting flu shot;. work RN's world varying levels education. Many homegrown ones (California) espouse pseudoscience clap trap. We're different monolithic group. family members work Methodist--I hear they've handling pandemic well organized-ly (I know that's word, till). We‚Äôve continued allow patio dining British Columbia new cases started trending downward. Using stolen vaccines ofc country making vaccines countries one largest vaccine producers can't ""utilize"" vaccines properly.....interesting... interesting...  You‚Äôre probably right, long person develops shingles, quickly checked gets treatment started. Otherwise, it‚Äôs definitely going worse mild covid symptoms. So... saying people shouldn‚Äôt get vaccine, something mentioned noted look unlucky people triggered vaccine recognize seek treatment sooner rather later. take precautions get urself vaccinated may 1. Reduce time spent news induce hell lotta anxiety. absolutely would be, proudly so. Conscription slavery, soldiers murderers. current pace, Sweden given everyone adult first shot within 20 weeks (We vaccinating 5% adults first shot week). I‚Äôm expecting us increase pace though. much vaccination hesitancy. get nothing changes? CDC's guidelines encourage rote compliance. They're carefully crafted get desired behavior 25th percentile society. know us prefer details capable finding them; many would stop reading first mention standard deviations dispersion factors. TLDR don‚Äôt worry it? would want get now? It‚Äôs reputation wrecked. Especially young woman- ask yourself, would really get - would prefer Pfizer/Moderna vaccines? study fortnightly asymptomatic testing. Pfizer's original study symptomatic COVID. US similar study found Pfizer vaccine similarly effective. some, all. I'm warned group (woman 50) choice chance J&amp;J chance covid, would still rather risk J&amp;J. Hell, I'm taking bigger risks already birth control that's get pregnant. would absolutely take j&amp;j instead taking chance covid ""Your people"" even want astra vaccine stored warehouses lol. ""try summer"" convince anti vaxxers. isn‚Äôt full digital analog outreach blitz? 0.00112% (If math correct)

That seems like *very* small report said 5 million people vaccinated Israel, 62 recorded cases myocarditis days shot. found 56 cases came second shot affected men 30. tie future stimulus check vaccinations. believe planning another round summer would require proof vaccination issuing them. bet vaccine sites would overrun then. tested positive, many asymptomatic? is, you‚Äôre fully vaccinated get Covid, what‚Äôs likelihood asymptomatic? totally get it, I‚Äôve lived someone ton life threatening medical conditions year, knew caught it, would death them. fully vaccinated little week (got shots waiting full time) get first haircut since February 2020. really alarming number people seemingly can't comprehend ""the faster vaccinate faster masks public spaces go away""


I swear common sense. think finally figured antivax people problems with.

They realize B decision taking vaccine they're actively making risky decision.

I've hear say things like ""why risk it"" ... explained antivax grandmother way think finally clicked her! ***UNTRUE***

[Great twitter thread research actually found (and shitty headline). I'm probably going make painfully obvious doctor scientist, *mmmmmaaayyybbee* entirely impossible two engaging coitus got vaccinated could possibly sort hormonal impact. Seems extremely unlikely, perhaps impossible. Damn guess got lucky. sore arm. would least try. got vaccinated Kentucky Canadian ID, they‚Äôre state requires residency. Phantastic! Please send Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. I'll take it. Well yes. Lets say country gets point massive surplus doses reason one getting vaccinated. point, choice die them. 

You cant destroy everyone elses mental health, financial wellbeing, lives, people want risk die. AZ largely ineffective SA variant. Every legit virologist epidemiologist concerned fast evasive variants emerge. Especially India Brazil sky rocketing. mean they/we irrational fear them, concern warranted. ""over it"" like reddit sub make position less valid. Yes news latches onto fear porn headlines literally besides point comes science this. Angela Merkel vaccinated week ago. still early. know you‚Äôre debating within context risk OC, personally I‚Äôm getting really tired position. don‚Äôt say rude attack you, point isn‚Äôt factually incorrect. 

But...

Severity isn‚Äôt issue here. It‚Äôs transmission probability viral mutation rendering efforts absolutely pointless. don‚Äôt protect children vaccinated pretend like go back normal, right back year ago new mutations misery. healthcare workers. common denominator high risk. takes account. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd draft dodger too. never guy. guy product population let's real, 50% voted em. indians blame leader americans blame leader. Whatever happened personal responsibility personal values/morals. Someone's attending organized rallies. leader asked attend. buy car know that's thing might die in. benefits far outweigh tiny risk. true vaccines. ü§î know true. Even JJ vaccine 100 times easier administrator certain highly vulnerable populations. Every time see post 'we need rescind mask mandates encourage people get vaccinated' always look profile 100% time either brand new account someone member multiple anti-mask subreddits see opportunity push getting rid mask mandates. waited almost hour get shot.

Do know must look rest world? 

Most rest world wait YEARS get chance shot. complaining nearly hour. Poor baby. American, would love able go Europe end summer. think herd immunity possible, degree. COVID seems evasive enough always here, knocked normal flu cold going good enough. 

I take umbrage metrics rely impossible vaccination metrics go back normal. it, doubt gets point. government isn‚Äôt going force it. bad COVID it‚Äôs smallpox. Also dont forget two doses, even halfway vaccination effort. point probably open kids. anything think get easier US. pharmacies probably keep doses around even massive vax effort wraps (just like stock flu/tetanus vaccines). Sanofi /s That‚Äôs basically what‚Äôs happening many states. state restrictions whatsoever one highest hesitancy rates. again? 1000th time... blood clots different types clots birth control cause. 'But birth control' new 'its flu'. J&amp;J vaccine almost two weeks ago. felt 100% fine first day two got tired, felt like somewhere ""lazy fatigue"". even cook dinner week, ate fast food energy morning make French toast Belgium waffles kiddo like normally goes school. biggest side effect back pain, sides lower back near kidney areas lasted days. mostly uncomfortable nothing major. 

I would like add, support posts title, would again. benefits outweigh risk.

On funny note... know least one person like right? friend mine ""You what!? would that!? changes DNA!"" ...he learned doctor video saw Internet video seemed ""very concerned"". Oi! kept telling ""cmon, tell saw Facebook."" wife receive mystery shot tomorrow. Fuck it! science care repercussions. People lay lives religion everyday least help progress science. actually happen. person might cycle that's around 27 days person B might cycle that's around 30 days. eventually intersect period time. Also, 0.01% 1 10,000. actually 0.0001% chance. don‚Äôt want one ‚Äúthose‚Äù lesbians/ women, something tells weird thing going men- would everywhere.

More generally, men deal bleeding genitals month society whole would probably take menstruation seriously.

Since perfect analogy menstruation men get bit creative. vaccines something strange men's testicles semen..... yeah, almost certainly would seen big deal. LOL first world countries choice limit export precious materials. speaking privileged view exactly point they're trying make. Help underprivileged. Well yeah, one million+ chance adverse event may may associated intervention enough reason discontinue vaccine. Fuck, women use hormonal birth control much higher risk stroke one million Don‚Äôt forget soda red meat too!  it‚Äôs much easily catchable thought conclusion reopen places revise social distancing?  Seems backwards bit bug going around. NFL fans profile anti-vaccine mutators. Water, bread, fruit, veggies, etc. car, buy things time. Grocery store block away. Point is, would covid now, devastating effects among elderly, speculation true. Clearly, work way, thankfully. They've already said vaccinated people gather, masklees, private spaces. What's left rescind? tried pharmacies? chain pharmacies get thier doses different allocation state/county worth checking availability. say restrictions needed? as-in need 3m instead 2m us?  NFL regular season doesn‚Äôt start September 9th. zero reason stadiums shouldn‚Äôt full never going without hand sanitizer begin with. 

We never return pre 2020 hygiene levels next time might even worse covid. read yesterday travels like second hand smoke. 6 60....

Well long 6 safer 1. really impractical study different doses different people, based gender, weight etc. dose (for anyone) finely calibrated protection. immune system far complex know directly. seems like 65-70% adults nationwide fairly likely, given 53% vaccinations started slow anti-vax areas. edge herd immunity combination natural immunity vaccine immunity. people subreddit downvote anything slightly negative. ridiculous. I'm sorry loss uncle. I'm praying things get better India. I‚Äôm slightly overweight healthy, exercise 4-5 times week, eat pretty good diet. know it‚Äôs statistically unlikely heart problem second shot, seems like decent enough chance make worry. mean 200M together two months. That's 200M / 60 days = 3.3 day delivering 2.5M day RN. weeks they'll probably ramp production catch up. look like Moderna behind schedule. effective first 12+ weeks regardless one two doses.

That's quite true, UK study found waning protection one dose Pfizer 4 weeks. adenovirus vaccines maybe give longer protection one dose, though seen direct comparison sure. actually true, taking bigger risk birth control.  taking different risk.

1) j&amp;j clots brain, legs

2) clots caused birth control treatable heparin.  ones caused j&amp;j vaccine not. Full disclosure, volunteering Case Investigator Contact Tracer last year, man... absolutely correct. people 5 people house say 1 thing day makes Household ~10+ Contacts would really nice able ask Quarantine one becomes infected. thing though, usually get talk Head Household get told them, ""Oh pretty safe nowadays, let house members know do."". recourse. talk more, maybe get chance talk household members, nearly impossible task try contact people people contact with. 

It really bad app start earlier, better adopted. IMHO, default installed phones hidden opt out. really passive ""data collection"", even call that. collects time stamps random numbers. location data, names. could least alerted people fact go get tested.

Even thought long time community transmission ""It's spreading community"". know friends family part community whole, masking around one another, keeping distance letting kids play together year now. getting really really old. Especially kids,a nd fabric society. .... grows nature spread seeds evolved attractive small birds. sweet birds eat it.

Strawberries found colder climates, found weeks year naturally. means essential human diet. even possible rely ""wild strawberries"" nutritional needs.

Stop pretending paleo-nutritionist lmao. Go get education, instead pretending intellectually superior people paid attention school trying tell India deserve mass casualties fat people there. sound ignorant *and* arrogant sound like kind American world mocks üòÇ understand higher efficacy numbers 2 studies.  tied last stimulus it, amazing Israel got USA going peter failure along political lines.  Ireland lockdown since March add this, protection Pfizer wane little 4 weeks post vaccination. know could wane even given several months. j j vaccine presumably found sufficiently high protection across 6 momth trial.. Lots CVS appts available check midnight! make sure search city name instead zip code (no idea works better, does). people probably still react with: ""It effects older people people preexisting conditions. healthy life style trust immune system."" Agree. 17 days city (Stockholm) scheduled open phase 4, 18-59 outside risk groups. Production capacity expanded vastly last months EU. recieved Pfizer Vaccine April 15th.... Canada, seem want wait 4 months administering second dose. worries me. instituted rule March. month doses(my mother thankfully fully vaccinated, 76.) 


 u/lovememychem could answer please, science backing 16 week wait?  
It seems like dunked thought supply low. 
However Canada seems getting enough Pfizer supply compared others(the vaccines Canada Pfizer.) 


 (I'm high risk individual got Pfizer vaccine, though would taken AZ vaccine anyways, plan provincial govt.)  agree stress, physical emotional, impact menstrual cycle. I've fully vaccinated since beginning February periods longer, heavier painful ever been. started first dose. They've extreme I'm getting tested anemia severe fatigue around time period. although believe menstrual changes could attributed stress reaction vaccine, think explains change persisting months. Wait afghanistan skiing? Effective Kent variant sure, hardly SA Brazil variants country still. enough data draw conclusions variants another month two would guess. Sinovac (Coronavac Brazil) AstraZeneca.  Let's call Spanish flu 'US-flu"" originated US. What? point conducted study found extremely positive results. Yet guidelines, statements, interviews largely acknowledged results (before one). yes, people willing lie use statements bolster quality lies. either choose science-first politics-first, ignoring results asked science-first option. understand people react wat do, maybe lost faith humanity.
Sometimes wish could move New Zealand.  It‚Äôll ok man. least US. 1.8 billion people around time. 4x people now, easier reach numbers, especially let virus run rampant means treat it. ""science know everything, did, would stop"" - dara briain would never able maintain peak, supply issue, demand. 


Example: rural counties, especially south, 40-45% adult non-senior white males saying consider taking vaccine (a statistic Tennessee). Brazil West, get mean. better term used Development work ‚ÄúGlobal North/South.‚Äù

No way China considered part Global South way. big economic superpower tons influence. numbers days 3 9 reflect benefit vaccination (the p values well 0.05). That's line clinical trial data showed protection day 7.

So weird value 'effectiveness' 0-3 days, know can't protection, trial data long know takes develop specific immunity. 

My guess - people likely feeling shitty days side effects like fever thus staying home.

Edit: see comment already came conclusion lol [Fact check: Birth control, vaccine blood clot comparison lacks nuance might mention comparison flawed people repeat dumb. one causes blood clots legs, brain. i'll let figure which. also, one treatable heparin, worsened heparin. always wondered virus something grotesque causes people‚Äôs limbs fall people start developing pus filled sores size grapefruits.

The fact covid deadly *seems* like flu making people dismissing.  Cool. Good thing rate increasing quickly. Nobody really knows many people died due Spanish flu. Estimates go 15 50 million people. 50 million high estimate takes account unreported cases. forget, human population break due it, fact, despite flu despite also world war, even make dent population growth curve. must missed part India asked US give away unused unapproved AZ vaccine stockpile? Agreed. think largely failed trial run. countries really stood utter successes *(looks longingly New Zealand).* Maybe fully vaccinated breakthrough-infected people? One would assume viral loads would significantly lower (20x lower, believe I‚Äôve read) thus unlikely spread. Whistling like NFL referees super bowl. already said give unused stuff. sense wasting. I'm willing go debt them. I'd love go back gym, exercising indoors masks still required, coming person who's fine wearing masks school, public transport buildings. mandate drops gyms, I'll going back gym. Honestly best purchase whole pandemic getting elliptical home. complete agreement. Republicans hem haw it, phrased National Security issue (it's works [climate colleagues fully vaccinated don‚Äôt symptoms don‚Äôt quarantine get tested. see trial run hope learn pandemic much worse virus emerges corner world. kidding! I'm pain anything shock sudden blood dripping face. hindsight funny time startled sure! Haha. breakthrough infection rate incredibly low. Lower people imagine hear percentages like ‚Äú60-80‚Äù, efficacy rate, relative placebo group. Breakthrough infections occurring rates 0.03 .1% states. member household sick least know blood isn‚Äôt clotting!

Sorry, couldn‚Äôt resist. Hope resolves. population dense countries, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs problem.

Notes:

* raw data downloaded exact totals every age group downloaded [CDC vaccination demographic trends CSV. CDC indicates data ""Date Administered"", actually appears ""Date Reported"".
* Texas (about 9% US population) excluded CDC demographic data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group calculated using 2019 Census estimates 11.4% aged 0 17 ages 16 17, assuming 0-17 age group doses given ages 16 17.   Yeah covering nose mouth like covering legs. Ridiculous gaslighting.

And way I‚Äôm pro vaccine fully vaccinated. bet even death rate among young people higher, Covid deniers people got tired it, would still totally ignore rules keep spreading virus. 

When dangerous virus ever occurs, humanity f###, humanity learned nothing. bright side, nature get take breather Well USA monopoly international force projection/violence, political pressure currency exploitation. Long way go level collective immunity. healthcare novel vaccine development?

I mean per capita US' death rate still miles ahead (if all) G20 countries.

A [simple example yeah, can't inject mRNA people though, need delivery system. actual technology ideas behind mRNA therapeutics novel, took forever trying figure make work humans. Anything gets vaccine body efficiently central development vaccine. 85% people get infected all, 6% got asymptomatic infection, 9% got symptomatic infection. point strawman - ""you've seen lost Canadians salty America sending vaccines"".

It's notable article mention Canadians.

My bigger point US' self interest, considering states supply exceeds demands, *is* US' self interest start exporting Canada recovery begins asap buy US help spur economy forward. main regulatory body say monday sputnik vaccine good go not, say yes already 40m

Sore, tired, weak, easily breathe, back 90% day after, 8th. past Tuesday 20th felt like relapse day-after symptoms, milder two days, additional side effect ""pukey"" feeling.

So started looking around seen anyone mention relapse vaccine side effects, 2nd shots causing previous covid infection symptoms relapse longhaulers. spent past year girlfriend nearly every day neither us ever tested positive, tested around 5 times.

So, like, covid point know? weird similar bug? doesn‚Äôt matter buy them. buy locally grow yourself. still never nutritious one wild went Moderna think name cool. Also first one could get easily :) Yes.

Seems pretty clear me. saying shut world trade?

Uhhh yea even need for? Food comes supermarket, trade. saves even one life, economic cost worth it. Otherwise endorsing murder line billionaire's pockets. Precisely this. think US would surge bad winter one without vaccines. many die IP laws allowing moderna Pfizer prevent world producing maximum amount best vaccine sake profits mean 1 million issue even less someone dying. finally make enough year needing them? üôÑ would rather catch covid naturally fine

We need much better messaging. Catching COVID young mean going fine.

There enough longer term side effects major concern among younger people. yet research suggest get okay long term.

In fact, research far, anyway, suggests opposite. cases, perhaps, much still unknown. know, think know, regarding lung heart issues something would risk age.

Our messaging horrible. need fix reach younger crowd. maybe, luck, hesitant people age cohorts.  Yup certainly would rather people get one dose get think nothing want bother scheduling twice. I'd hate turn people getting second dose already planning get though.  reason EU Canada others delaying second shot supply.

I make popsicles home, 5 days homemade popsicles breakfast lunch dinner food. change couple hours. Godspeed. Honestly don‚Äôt think political affiliation anything whether willing take vaccine not, small percentage. many liberal conservative friends want wait bit see unknown side effects, say get eventually, completely reasonable decision person weigh personal risks...I think fact people believe political sides media tries spin However, emoyers must terminate every single employee, company wide, meet criteria.

Uh, like firing every employee doesn‚Äôt get COVID-19 vaccine? know, exactly like said they‚Äôd do... Exactly. Oregon Washington higher rates California Texas now, despite fact looser restrictions.

Not required. honestly, done it? J&amp;J vaccine covid completely avoidable. vaccines high supply, likelihood catching covid drops every single day, high risk individuals opportunity get Pfizer/Moderna options months now. Low risk individuals zero reason get J&amp;J vaccine. look Israel, lots people vaccinated, border closed. Indian variant country, one vaccine might less effective.

**might** less effective. However, variant thus far broken vaccines. kind dumb assume one still allowing people travel ? Stop already. Get everyone vaccinated open regions fully vaccinated.

Not mention, vaccination rate time high. live south toss up, got older Log Cabin people January ""it's miracle vaccine get us back normal"" soon Biden came became ""it's liquid microchipped genocidel liquid death"" Though apply applied Emergency applications vaccinations? Like one we're right now, C-19 vaccines Emergency released FDA. Agreed. Washington well (once got past initial surge). Low natural immunity rates mean virus spread easier. also lot people worked extra hard make responsible choices bit burnt out. shit wasn‚Äôt point getting vaccinated? even news?

Matthew Miller, associate professor Department Biochemistry Biomedical Sciences McMaster University Hamilton, Ont., says main issue treatment difficult deliver.

Since given via intravenous, experts say Bamlanivimab administered hospital setting within 10 days developing symptoms. patient sick, treatment cannot administered.

‚ÄúUnlike pill, easily brought home taken patients house, antibodies delivered intravenous infusions take quite bit time delivered specialized settings medical supervision,‚Äù Miller said interview CTV National News.

‚ÄúSo presents real logistical challenge administering drugs, especially patients yet ill yet wouldn‚Äôt need hospitalized,‚Äù added.

Kumar said antibody therapy needs given ‚Äúas early possible course disease.‚Äù However, challenging may sick get facility time.

‚ÄúThis means COVID, need get emergency room infusion centre, receive monoclonal, that‚Äôs difficult do,‚Äù Kumar said.

In U.S., places also grappling logistics using drugs help keep COVID-19 patients hospital, places like Johns Hopkins Medicine set outpatient monoclonal antibody therapy infusion centres help deal treatment challenges.

Antibody drugs also harder make, Sidhu said, $1,500 dose, bamlanivimab cheapest medication. Still, experts said less cost hospitalization put intensive care.

‚ÄúThe people help littlest self-capacity make antibodies,‚Äù said Sidhu.

IMPACT CANADIANS

Eighty-year-old John Tavel contracted coronavirus Ottawa last December. told CTV National News symptoms progressed, greatest fear dying disease.

‚ÄúMy fever 103, 103 half ‚Ä¶ feeling horrible. So, wife called ambulance, ambulance took right hospital,‚Äù Tavel explained.

At hospital, Tavel asked treated Bamlanivimab. doctors said couldn‚Äôt administer it.

Tavel said doctor told ‚Äúdon‚Äôt protocol‚Äù drug. Instead, discharged told take Tylenol help get fever down.

Tavel‚Äôs daughter, Robyn, lives Glencoe, Illinois, says family heard using monoclonal antibodies help treat COVID-19 local news then-U.S. President Donald Trump given antibody cocktail virus.

‚ÄúAs soon knew available Canada‚Ä¶ immediately knew father it,‚Äù Robyn said. ‚ÄúThe window opportunity administer 10 days someone become sick, diagnosed, get action.‚Äù

Robyn said frustrated learned father would access treatment.

‚ÄúTo find treatment available, could administered father recover almost overnight minimize effects virus body, available upsetting,‚Äù Robyn said.

Tavel‚Äôs symptoms continued get worse, eventually ended back hospital COVID-19 ward.

He says eventually received corticosteroid called dexamethasone, made feel bit better. eventually discharged hospital recover home.

While Tavel make full recovery, said still frustrated experience.

‚ÄúWe [the drug] Canada. People dying, don‚Äôt use it?‚Äù said.

Robyn said thankful father OK contracted virus, worries others may become ill need antibody treatment.

‚ÄúI still members family Canada potentially could become sick virus need know government acting quickly make treatment available Canadians,‚Äù Robyn said.

In U.S. researchers also exploring use monoclonal antibodies preventative option vulnerable groups, immunocompromised patients respond COVID-19 vaccines. patients produce antibodies either result treatments diseases like cancer born impaired immune system.

Similarly, bamlanivimab shown lower risk contracting symptomatic COVID-19 among residents staff long-term care facilities, according results phase III clinical trial Eli Lilly conducted collaboration National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases (NIAID) COVID-19 Prevention Network.

AN EXTRA TOOL FIGHT COVID
As infections continue rise across much country, growing calls tap overlooked treatment save lives.

Kumar says provincial leaders health officials need come together figure way implement Bamlanivimab health-care system. said hospitals could set mobile clinics infusion centres help get antibody therapy could benefit it.

‚ÄúThe new data that‚Äôs coming, shows therapies actually prevent death, prevent hospitalizations, we‚Äôre going reduce burden emergency rooms hospital beds, really need figure use therapies large scale,‚Äù Kumar said.

Miller said treatment could especially helpful Canada continues face increased hospitalizations due disease.

I hope ok. say prayer them. might wrong, festival attended 2 million people venue, last happened 2010 supposed happen 2022, got preponed due astrological reasons. totally makes sense me, because, people prioritize horoscope matches major criteria arranging marriages. No. China bought masks. bought everything world January eye eye ü§ó US population increased 230% since 1918. Comparing raw numbers extremely dishonest. agree. think could.... said.

Mrna amazing tech. could booster shots maybe 3 months evade immunity.

Hopefully won't... definitely need help nations vaccines.... world problem need work together.

Less spread equals less future mutations less need boosters longer span boosters....

But need 70 percent world vaccinated...

I think focus high population centers travel hubs... vector vaccine. They're using (harmless) part another virus (an Adenovirus, believe chimp, quote that), taking bits engineering spike protein Sars-cov-2 virus place, immune system react to. Big difference mRNA vaccines case, spike protein included vaccine, whereas mRNA vaccines, mRNA codes spike protein introduced, body creates spike protein.  social distancing palliative

you want sure get covid? stay home

you cannot avoid going mix others? well, assume may getting covid mean told scientists.

And see nothing wrong people wanting wait safest amount time getting vaccinated. never understood reasoning around world. hated China taking excessive defensive measures complaining simultaneously China care people. 

Like, can't both.

When saw photos China bulldozing roads Wuhan, knew real talk time. Thanks. real human toll COVID-19 untold human misery happening India type this. Yep this. China makes cold hearted calculations things - went full shutdown without hesitation told us needed know Covid. listen course. get forecasted 20k per day death toll... That's way tens thousands.... Could million month....I mean india lot slums close living quarters 7 times people usa.

Plus they're still developing nation, medical tech less statistical analysis. lot numbers probably even get counted.... way autopsy sure lot dead.

Not sure good tracking excess death betting huge over.... So... anyone obstructs oxygen supply, obstruct oxygen supply. Got dead inside swear Right need get vaccines people and, importantly, need get Group 2 vaccinated start Group 3 (cause Germany top priority following rules). case, they'll either need move Group 2's appointments end May (unlikely) vaccinate majority country span like six weeks. problem going switch supply supply using efficiently order follow old rules. 

It's six months German government done fuck up. believe single second aspect crisis change people elected September take control. vaccines going arrive ""just weeks away"" since like February what? Probably government going something stupid make logical sense certainty help situation. deniers sub told outdoor perfectly safe /s

In country largest increase cases events large crowds, even held outdoors. Outdoor transmission definitively happening enough distance masking. Okay ... worst case scenario happening then? Still ridiculously slow Spain. plateaus misleading caused enough tests. 100,000 tests likely see much 20-30k cases. US obligated help rest world ahead people? Combination bad factors probably. Loosening restrictions racing vaccinate. appreciate wanting vaccinate teachers question choice given fact point 3-4 months left school year teachers resistant return went back classroom hybrid couple days week. view waiting open school fall keeping teachers regular vaccine priority would made sense concentrate getting vaccinated. think decision slowed whole works everyone behind group. Add crummy vaccine scheduling tool sprinkle lowest vaccine distribution state. think could done better Oregon. won't. They'll probably hide them. question is, ate concerns Indian variant? already found Belgium countries still haven‚Äôt closed arrivals India. Lets hope variant isn‚Äôt able completely ignore vaccines. thing is, risk groups HUGE, think risk groups together bigger rest population, part thanks fucked demographic composition many old people. looks like takes super long get perceived ""select"" risk groups, reality already huge part population. Indian life worth American one? trust reports India? really looks like happens restrictions lifted without vaccinations.

Infection reports kinda you‚Äôd expect exponential growth, happened everywhere else last year without/beforerestrictions, amount seriously ill overwhelmed Indian healthcare system.  Thus mortality skyrockets.

This government job. can't say I've seen lot fat people nursing home. people live long tend waste away bit.

Supermarket strawberries taste like ass, know about. month buy local strawberries, do.

Also smart enough understand virus hurts health vaccine also survival trait.

Meanwhile pandemics would cause mass die offs Hunter gatherers, see: indigenous tribes Americas Europeans gave diseases. Although... highest number new community infections since Dec 31. five cases placed quarantine earlier, Ministry Health (MOH) said preliminary daily update. community cases close contacts Case 62113, 39-year-old Indonesian man sea crew board bunker tanker. tested positive COVID-19 Apr 16. let‚Äôs vaccinate young! Janssen Vaccines fully owned J&amp;J. wrong calling either way. use interchangeably. Youre bit late party donny. Idk saw posted comment time zero upvotes, time useless news random town US well posted time already close 1k upvotes. I've read many many many comments people said they're getting first vaccine cause read 75 percent effective.... heard wears faster etc... There's reasons getting both.

People definitely need get boosters next year there's one new variant protect from.... earth caused spike massive? There's thing pandemic, kind -demic!

Pandemic, epidemic, academic, they're neocolonial constructs fabricated subjugate masses! 

/s getting from? even read ""continental"" media, better question even read it? videos coming break heart. hope turn around quickly. Bearing mind much advanced medical science public health nowadays, think surmise pathogen Covid much deadly H1N1. Coming someone idea talking about. already proved ignorance. talking about? one upvoted posts week. even know plateau means? restrictions way different last year Janssen subdivision J&amp;J... guess folks call Janssen headquarters EU, J&amp;J headquartered US. elderly people fat well.My granpa 77 years old could still 50 pushups climb biggest tree could find without breaking sweat.Reality unhealthy doesn‚Äôt matter old are.This planet turned away health long time ago.Life expectancy higher ever doesn‚Äôt mean people healthy.You fat incapable getting keep alive years years come.Even things used healthy healthy anymore.This whole planet survival strong survive.For example ‚Äúbio‚Äù strawberries buy supermarket can‚Äôt compared true wild strawberries.Difference strawberries like difference wild life lion zoo lion.Everything grow controlled environment can‚Äôt develop things grow wild don‚Äôt fight survive.Strawberries wild fight everything anything like weather,insects,viruses...while strawberries controlled environment dont anything nothing attacking all.Thats end strawberries never quality nutrition wild strawberries. vaccinations live campus? mean.... need frozen stuff? 

Wouldn't make sense require vaccinated students live campus? actual vaccines?  completely false. think masks necessary beginning new virus strain dont trust anything say? absolutely ignorant comment. vaccine protcts variants prevents hospitalizations death. Additional - sore throat obvious waking morning. day feel try check still less significant morning. well half populations India‚Äôs cities already infected? real figure must staggering. understanding many 'moderate' Covid cases require oxygen - think supplemental oxygen 1918? doubt N95 type masks effective PPE either. Covid emerged 1918 suspect would even catastrophic H1N1.

We *did* anti-public health measure people though. Never seems shortage sort thing. fact modern medicine manages save many people COVID, mean effect described contribution excess mortality. Modern medicine reduce mortality equality across medical conditions ‚Äî far successful treating conditions better others. discussion moot without ability accurately quantify contributing factor. Big difference vaccines vaccinated significant chunk population whereas India barely anyone vaccinated. election day? sore throat - like there's lump upper part throat. unlike usual sore throat got before. 3 days. issue, lil anxiety. 

Is symptom? kill 2 save 12.

But kill 2 US seem swimming mRNA vaccines?

Let younger people Pfizer Moderna kill anyone. older people J&amp;J benefit-risk ratio much better. mention first year pandemic fairly limited blind study. even 95% effective symptomatic covid. Real world data going bare witness time goes it. Still get vaccinated, dogmatic people original studies came alarming. Science proven vaccine safe effective better unknown long term effects covid.

Your vaccine denial though belief, cognizant dissonance. believing want based sound scientific technological reasoning back up.

Tldr: get vaccinated lose privileges country still choice. required go college probably should... Like, really... anybody needs education...  Good like anyone brain knew. Move along get people vaccinated. observation people made. Viruses play rules. going randomly mutate mutations survive better time go replicate more. Sometimes means mutation makes infectious confidentially less deadly (which gives host time spread it) hard rule. dust radioactive? Maybe government deliberately underpromising risk creating false expectations things go wrong, appear savior things go right.

It's Spain, keep repeating targets like 70% end summer (i.e. late September). mean time Belgium seems headed using AZ anyone 41+ JJ without restriction. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Mask wearing seems like part one last things stop population level. annoying (compared lot stuff do) moderately effectively intervention. elaborate further: reported 100% survival rate one control groups died. Let's say administer dose 2,000 individuals. one control group dies, simply means probability severe COVID19 + hospitalisation + death = less 1/2000 i.e. **less 0.05%.**  Vaccine firmware 1.1 bullshit requirement. Neithervare students affected age superspreader. importantly vaccination stop individual spreading virus Afaik Sweden planning starting phase 18+ May onwards, could early weeks. I'm idiot go midst lol, never seen clickbait news site? find hard believe

Your India say new threat may affect vaccine efficacy, studies needed

You making like claim vaccine work it. Yeah. do. Reduced infections. Reduced chances hospitalisation. Reduced communal infection spread. 
Yep. 
Consequences.

The consequences pretty awesome actually. Try 50,000- that's probably closer real figure India reports 5,000 officially. Yes completely ignores many covid patients saved thanks modern medicine would died without it. anything see opposite effect. saving far far people people died then. Modern medicine skews numbers opposite suggested. Check happening Indian without hospital treatment oxygen. modern medical system overwhelmed people dying outside hospitals pavement. India: \~4% \~1.3 billion \~54million. That's non-trivival number. overlooked downplayed, understating human toll country‚Äôs outbreak, accounts nearly half new cases global DELHI ‚Äî India‚Äôs coronavirus second wave rapidly sliding devastating crisis, hospitals unbearably full, oxygen supplies running low, desperate people dying line waiting see doctors ‚Äî mounting evidence actual death toll far higher officially day, government reports 300,000 new infections, world record, India seeing new infections country far, almost half new cases global experts say numbers, however staggering, represent fraction real reach virus‚Äôs spread, thrown country emergency mode. Millions people refuse even step outside ‚Äî fear catching virus extreme. Accounts around country tell sick left gasp air wait chaotic hospitals running lifesaving sudden surge recent weeks, insidious newer variant possibly playing role, casting increasing doubt India‚Äôs official Covid-19 death toll nearly 200,000, 2,000 people dying every day.

Both types equally dangerous far messaging. Nothing like US printing half dollars that's ever existed last year lot people refusing get vaccine wear masks anyway. grocery store morning require masks. Saw least dozen people wearing them. That's store couple weeks ago.

I honestly suffered anxiety worrying side effects. Honestly, question outside scope. still considered weighed risk vs reward reward greatly outweighs possible risk later. now, get stuff mom high risk elderly, stuff partner moderately high risk. think long decent amount time passed, nearly 6 months, nothing catastrophic happened, think I‚Äôll fine. 

But know handful people side effects covid several months personally think made right decision. kids' dentist vaccinated except pregnant hygienist going clean immunocompromised son's teeth, let us switch different one. That's good dentist does. Covid-16? Excellent news! Here's another article wonder many died/will die Covid lack access vaccine initial efficacy/safety testing. studied pregnant women decades? thought mostly used cancer research- many subjects tend pregnant? find hard believe. 

However, I'm disputing appears safe pregnant women right now. familiar numerous pregnancy forums seem increasing trend pregnancy loss, seems like every post vaccinated. pointing 6 companies EU orders AZ number 2 terms doses delivered.

Because AZ supposed cornerstone EU inoculation program based estimates production delivered. said ""we deliver 30 million doses"" EU could ordered elsewhere gone done business AZ first much companies provided far? 

Everything supposed deliver, and, case Pfizer, even beyond supposed to. problem EU designed program assumption AZ would deliver ballpark promised certainly could under-deliver, under-deliveries insane 70% doses delivered. throat virus 3 /4 years ago thing, pain 1 ear, ended perforating, fluid years after, see ent get head scan, lost hearing perminantly, feels better fucked single virus Yes. high US it‚Äôs high india Re-opening always tied levels vaccination.

It‚Äôs like Covid going away, get rid it. response either mask indefinitely remove restriction reasonable level, described. longer, early period three days J&amp;J shot. I'm 49 7 day long period since mid 30's. 

Interesting seems come vaccines. think period harmful, per se. weird, small side effect like fatigue couple days after.

I'm really curious happening. nothing else, maybe we'll gain new insight this. second shot fast thought needle spring loaded. recall feeling little tingle first shot, may excitement.

Fortunately! digging history employment law States. Wow, guys actually rights century ago! 

It's matter balance legality legitimacy. Also women pregnant birth control. pulmonary embolism pregnant, wouldn‚Äôt take J &amp; J. luckily access Moderna. Florida? Texas? Similar backwater state? I've already gotten vaccine, I'm young healthy - fat. got vaccinated data clearly supports vaccinations. Getting vaccinated help protect vulnerable society. Data also supports efficacy masks. able understand selfish troglodyte. Go deny science somewhere else. Based this, I'm higher risk getting severe side effect actually covid bad outcome.

(Lower low cases country around 7/100000 high # daily tests).

I AZ vaccine 2 days ago btw.

With data, would probably refused it.

What ""hits me"" want give proper figures.

When asked journalists, dodged ""this met here"", clearly, look incidence see 1/50000 &lt;49 (down lowest age group).

2 weeks ago ""1 million"".

Now ""1/100000"", sure, aggregate 60-90, younger age groups 1/50000.... Sounds relatively unnecessary high... mean refute far gone? 

I'll try though. one, IFR .02. actually roughly 1% (50 times higher claimed). Second, 35% 50% people get covid hospitalized symptoms last least 3 months. yes likely die covid young healthy minimum 1 3 chance experience symptoms last months, ground-glass opacities lungs, numerous issues. 

The option take vaccine which, months diligent testing 10s thousands teat subjects, proven safe effective.

Or people like we'll stay lockdown purgatory forever. maybe that's want. Probably due S-protein virus/vax antibodies make protect us against. N-protein linked amyloid plaques brain common cause parkinsons. I‚Äôll look S-protein risks Well, reports blood clots literally one million.

Yeah, husband actually Mexican seeing people cry state *our* vaccination program flat embarrassing. coworkers got vaccinated within 6 weeks two months covid infection worse usual side effects, that's worried about. 420,420,420 Agree. Show proof vaccination pay fee make sure sherpas support staff country vaccinated. Hell, Nepal charge enough vaccinate entire country. 50 grand climb Everest, like would overtaxing poor climbing Everest anyway. agreed. Israel stalled low 60's much higher uptake %. think get 60 huge win.

No, understand polarization. People used biased reasoning reinforce emotionally-appealing position. reason people downvote posts Reddit.

It's exactly reason vaccines must mandated. many made politics instead science. really, plague several definitions common usage, including literally bubonic plague also used much broadly synonymous epidemic people still need indoors bit - like use restroom. number children hospitalized severe Covid-19 symptoms hit high 70 week ‚Äî **twice many hospitalized worst days wave swept state November**.

Otherwise, looking forward forensic studies correcting behavior next one! Ah famous ""Just patience"" line. long saying ""Deliveries going pick weeks?"" 

Do honestly believe they'll losen priority restrictions supply longer limiting factor? strongly believe case; think they're going continue original plan even longer makes sense so. like current policies make sense now. can't leave house 21 offices whatever want schools open? Nothing makes sense. situation long control they're random stuff show. 

There's reason hopeful; whole thing catastrophic failure. government knows extend useless lockdown. We're probably still going lockdown September; hopefully criminals get voted out. body shaming? single dose strategy produced poor results people blood cancers elderly (especially variants). much Quebec scrambling give seniors second doses nursing homes... different brand. ‚Äúassuming Sure India also mess government. Festivals, population, mass transit. Vaccines would certainly help Indian govt much adults opportunity vaccinate themselves, don't. paying ignorance others child's development. Whatever is, Indian situation exceptionally bad. India country least vaccinations, one least lockdowns, welcoming tourists.

 factor, mutated strains caused jump Seeing we‚Äôre already shutting mass vaccination sites interest dwindling, come get guess. 

I work grocery store talking boss many people work vaccinated. heard figure around quarter staff shot. told blown away people got vaccine plan getting it. I‚Äôm disappointed people work with. 

I know people shots negative reactions vaccine. One elderly guy gets severe symptoms two days everyone thinks that‚Äôs happens people get vaccinated. It‚Äôs maddening. assuming J&amp;J? Ain't happening.. bright side next year well normal... gets better that. everyone level protection, COVID would struggle spread would need get exposed others like not, also beat 85 percent rate protection.

Kind like high rate adult vaccinations Israel continues crush spread? Ahhh, choice fired submitting Bill Gates' mind control microchips, they'll take microchips. Funny conspiratorial nonsense flies window moment shit gets real... covid-19 higher Spanish flu. Anime Rael.....? That‚Äôs B117. We‚Äôve moved Indian variants P1. Well can't translate covid-19 2020 100 years ago, many things different. Medical knowledge technology one completely different, might well using leeches. think would far worse. made two false statements cannot back data. emotional argument you. Higher risk speeds study.

All studies control group vaccinated. efficacy rate 85% mean 85 percent people exposed contract virus; fact, probably higher that.

What compare control group vaccinated group. assumption that, average, similar level exposure COVID. 85 percent effective would mean that, given day could expect 100 healthcare workers contract COVID vaccinated, expect 15 workers vaccinated.

But gets better that. everyone level protection, COVID would struggle spread would need get exposed others like not, also beat 85 percent rate protection. Fake internet points don‚Äôt matter. said opinion: want require it? Fine, better fully FDA approved so, EUA, like every vaccination that‚Äôs required. see happens fall. Btw, headline misrepresents study... ‚Äúduh‚Äù Oops it‚Äôs actually 50-75k Mumbai It‚Äôs one thing reuse something makes nose run eyes itch week hour two, another thing reuse disease kill 8-12+ hours day, 5+ days week. don‚Äôt know.

Agree this? applies million gets Covid though.... can‚Äôt believe gullible people still taking vaccines. won‚Äôt crying succumb whatever effects happen future them. made choice, despite warning signs &amp; info them. Good luck &amp; non reproductive children future. SIGN IT. 

We take risks every day, actions stuff put bodies (medication included). risk one willing take. There's way Mumbai tests 250,000 people per current RT-PCR testing capacity stands mind test best 52% accurate, done absolutely perfectly ideal conditions.

The figures include entire Mumbai Metropolitan Region including Navi Mumbai, Thane, Panvel etc... That's 45,000 daily tests 23 million people (2016 data), **0.19% population getting tested daily**. Literally link blood clots would incredibly rare anyway. paused doctors educated treatment ti give people abnormal blood clot treatable. People died used wrong treatment rare clblood clot. 

You already lied said 500 plus people need sacrificed? Makes sense. someone history blood clot choose different vaccine want. gact think even 20 cases 7-8 million doses insane. extremely effective safe vaccine tske requires 1 shot exceptionally helpful poor rual areas. 

So glad people like arent charge this. Maybe that's poor wording part. novel technology great deal possible unknowns could disrupted roll out. plenty valid concerns vaccine makers looking toward proven technologies.

Like us I'm best source science. wonder many years it'll sift data map exactly certain outbreaks happened. 

MI fascinating little example me. localized yet SHARP rise, followed noticeable decline. posited MI ""good"" earlier states loosening restrictions, outbreak bound happen. MI really *that* many potential cases waiting neighboring states? considering states became lax guidelines see explosion compared MI makes think play.

And see pretty solid decline week, yet why? folks suddenly take seriously news media covered surge? Governor lot power taken legislature earlier, like hard lockdown happened tamp things off. good, contact tracing top notch. time could implement that, able walk get anyway. We're already point states. Also, hoops make people jump through, fewer get vaccinated. worth trade off. many people scheme things. Covid kills late, weeks often still deadly transmissible. reading CDCs youtube channel CDC's vaccine assessment. astra zeneca coronavac population grown lot since 1918. share source full spike protein? thing could find CDC site, says piece spike COVID-19 mRNA vaccines give instructions cells make¬†a harmless piece¬†of called ‚Äúspike That's exactly viewed it. got dose #2 couple days ago. like needles (nobody does) Dr's. I'm vaccinated said civic duty leave alone lol. file taxes eligible stimulus imagine like parts world spikes happened, people got comfortable well enough already, started ignoring guidelines India dense population, spike crazy. common wisdom deadly, highly contagious virus kill many hosts burn out, therefore virus doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwant‚Äù become deadly. thing evolution though genetic mutations don‚Äôt choose one thing another, it‚Äôs entirely possible random mutations produce lethal variant burn it. There‚Äôs really reason virus couldn‚Äôt kill whole bunch people going extinct, less lethal cousin becomes endemic survivors.

In end viruses become less lethal, try lethal options along journey.

I expert, someone took time understand basics evolution. I'm glad living state demand still high... Behavior optimism bias. Like Texas, Florida, Arizona last summer. Man I'm sick people think asking objective criteria parameters lifting restrictions like asking magic switch flipped magic date things magically get better. Saying ""At X rate vaccination rate cases, reopen"" objective scientific. possible see vaccine data residents one city? city (Philadelphia) seem count residents got vaccinated outside city. look article? lays several different ways looking numbers. comparing raw numbers. record germany 770.000 one day. 

brazil 3 times germany's population

&amp;#x200B;

in case, see point comparing much. happy things going right direction countries. good development. Thanks explanation! also majority non vaxers believe vaccines used kill couple years- even ones showing blood clots. people believe depopulation control method. Thailand, Vietnam, Mongolei Cambodscha Giving objective parameters ""a convenient magic pill."" say X rate vaccination, rate cases, reopen. that's know about. paid bit more, would enjoy higher staff retention rates, reducing dependency expensive agency staff. Staff would happy well motivated give best work do, improving performance, reducing errors resolving discipline issues organically.

I guarantee you, managers places despise staff, lazy, stupid careless. Incapable working independently, need constant surveillance.

Newsflash: staff feckless, staff problem. you. 99% human beings' natural state happy productive, 99% staff lazy, selfish assholes means crushed them.

I've seen difference, *employers* realise primary purpose *employ people* rather maximise shareholder profits, get really good *employing people*. organisation gets really good putting people productive, rewarding work, everything else falls place.

Employees buy goals organisation, working harder, working independently, constantly pushing better do. Even weaker staff get better job without told off, easy rewarding learn care work doing. for-profit care environments dire need reform. say like low probability...

That‚Äôs nearly 28,000. Still problem: US, Thalidomide wasn‚Äôt ever approved FDA. Early samples illegally distributed, didn‚Äôt issues women Australia Germany never legal. anything, opposite effect did- companies always test drugs women, ask even questions immediate effects, follow even longer period time. Well duh, germs travel via inverse square law ie particles decrease exponentially respect distance someone. it‚Äôs logical conclude risk transmission decreases distance, that‚Äôs exactly happens. study modeled ways may perfect approximation doesn‚Äôt actually dispute consistently found observation distance make difference.  think there's documented case 60 feet.

You understand one advocating wearing mask 365 days year normal times, right? 

Outside pandemic, something maybe week per year most, bad cold flu want spread everyone like douche. already were, that's obviously case.

That's also appalling argument make. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer planning new version coronavirus vaccine stored standard freezer comes diluted ready use, CEO told AFP Friday.

Awesome news! Makes logistics transportation much easier. outright state ‚Äúhey kids start getting vaccinated, we‚Äôre approaching need be.‚Äù agree concept isn‚Äôt outlandish, also know day (see Israeli scientists saying vaccinate population ages 12 believe get herd immunity) Damn. want gift card getting flu vaccine. happening Guayaquil, Ecuador, almost year ago. ran coffins, start burying cardboard coffins. also videos people dropping bodies street running away. I'm Georgia I'm seeing PSAs TV signs outside get vaccine. think experts saying it‚Äôs waste send vaccines British Columbia. It‚Äôs far gone savers. Better redirect vaccines Quebec vaccine program kill COvId dead.

If together, it‚Äôs better save Quebec society make futile
Attempt BC. Sorry BC, experts saying every dose waste precious, life saving resources. That's think mandating vaccines inevitable. places area tell vaccine you‚Äôre signing for. tried different sites found one want. safe, 0.01% risk humans shown terrible evaluating risk. 

As engineer fairly adept risk assessment, hits home. many people absolutely suck assessing risk. i.e. ""Johnny he's fine..."" we're whatever cutoff percentage need memorial day, say open up, anti-vaxxers leave let great God Darwin take care it. I've seen unvaccinated nurses act shitty selfish wearing mask flu season. 

auto-mod deleted 2017 FB post nurse describing selfishness.

We may much 30 million AZ doses, though i'm sure exact amount confirmed. 

That could save many thousands lives. We're way 60 many age groups. Also CDC needs start heavily consider rescinding masking/distancing guidelines vaccinated people give incentive combats vaccine apathy.

A lot people going feel like ""why bother?"" asked go right back masking distancing. got Limited Edition J&amp;J üíÖ

Yeah better giving young american people american life worth more? go pre-registration system shows vaccine given site uses booking process. 9,600,423 per CDC‚Äôs site right now. Atlanta, Benz recently changed walk-ins suspect mass sites around state soon follow. think eventually we'll see walk-ins shift mass sites local pharmacies, grocery stores, doctor's offices, etc. stores probably offer gift card incentive like Publix flu vaccine. mean, concept outlandish: without vaccinating kids herd immunity possible. They'll vaccinated, issue there. One shot Pfizer may actually work better JnJ, may longer lasting effect. However, nobody knows regimen tested Phase 3 studies. Nobody claim protection period one shot Pfizer simply tested. strong Christians associate it,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúFear drives people get vaccine ‚Äî plain simple. stronger someone‚Äôs trust Lord, least likely want vaccine feel it‚Äôs necessary.‚Äù

God help us. 2.4 million average (\~1.85 million 1st doses, 550k 2nd doses) Cheers! Long story short, vaccinating kids needed herd immunity. Nothing unsurprising. LA sites seem starting too. heads literally can't look history women's health without coming across multitude feminist movements. US, women included clinical trials 1980s, legislation forced trials include women. Even then, write even legislation trials simply it. Saying learn body works incredibly ironic US 40 years research bodies. 

It makes lot sense body's immune response vaccine would cause irregular menstruation. reason, mentioned it. women IUDs taken think there's something really wrong they're day 10 usual 5 day period. 

I got second shot yesterday, told get mammogram six weeks? paperwork provided either time, Google search showed pharmacist talking about. Ah yes, give since nothing gonna change. Absolute amazing fucking levels sophistry experts answers thrown hands up. Christ, sometimes really wonder run with. Let‚Äôs conveniently ignore people vaccinated population also protects population yet vaccinated hopefully soon get vaccinated.  Yeah right. 70% want 40% gotten so... Theres also Warfarin, iirc. Could recieved one? Really? Also Mass, first scheduled mass site appointment said vaccine site chose. looked CVS later, also stated vaccine using. within past week, maybe different earlier. That's why, normal times, wear handful days per year sick airborne illness, like cold flu. something wear 365 days year; pointless sick. wasting time. Take one glance post history, good person.  conspiracy theory people directly tell think. I've seen people subreddit explicitly express much they've enjoyed restrictions plan wearing mask rest lives. I've seen openly wishing never go back person work.

 huge part revolves around issues class, though traditional way think class. term floating around Twitter referred class people whose jobs well-suited telecommuting, thus negatively impacted lockdowns: pajama class. Members pajama class actually whole benefitted lockdowns, least financial sense. Running costs like gas fallen, received stimulus money like everyone else. people hurting, they're fine. Provided really care socializing travel, little reason want end. easy though? everyone could, already would now, no? do. Pfizer effective first 12+ weeks regardless one two doses. I‚Äôm saying shouldn‚Äôt wear mask anywhere I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. went going right vaccine available, 585,032 deaths (+- untold amount) 189,549 deaths (+- shit load one knows about)  

The US government bought vaccines use do, buy vaccines start giving countries citizens get them, India also problem mass cold storage anyway? latest high quality polling 51% definitely wanted vaccine, another 17% probably wanted it. 51% moving 17% segment. Although slower, group get vaccine, lower rates. also another 15% seems might able convinced. 15% hard no. last poll March. Unless people though March's poll way off, slow expected. Scott Gottlieb predicted well. good news is, path 70%+ next couple months, slower rest us want (including already 1st shot done). Fair point. Unfortunately live somewhere they‚Äôre plentiful :-/ trust them

And dont trust Dr, get new one ask them.  first shot put already covid maybe body ready. Trials vaccines looked ancestral strain vs UK strain still saw slightly less efficacy UK strain (see example novavax trial) could definitely explain small 5-10% discrepancy here. agree asymptomatic vs symptomatic likely accounts difference though  literally reason Japan managed survive well, government literally nothing entire time except ask people wear masks open windows. start every expert like yeah guys done for, theyve botched response every step, going explosive spread, lucked massively traditional cultural response diseases happened shockingly effective specific virus. one hand think US definitely lift export ban vaccines would absolutely help prevent **future** surge, hand it... seems like already late really help **current** case surge there?

Like, would help production bottleneck, production's still going take time, distribution various clinics/vaccination centers/whatever's going take time, getting shots arms going take time, 2-3 weeks first dose get effective.

This also assuming India vaccine hesitancy issues like US does.  it‚Äôs like 1 600 chance pill, 

That‚Äôs whole discussion think worthwhile, actually. want test pregnant women safe side. Context

We're going able convince (many) people. missing concerning pseudovirus neutralization assay data. Empirically looking like facets immunity meaning vaccines still pretty effective (thankfully), hub bub come nowhere.

For South Africa, Brazil, probably New York anyway (haven't seen arrays worrying spike mutation). UK variant never seriously believed problem vaccines. particularly nasty one go unvaccinated population. Moderna also testing third dose original vaccine helps variants well. Ha! Love it. overweight/obese, diabetes comorbities? would take vaccine.

Students would warn high school friends, prospective students would go elsewhere. Correlation equal causation. people caught somewhere venues risk see table 2 study, hazard ratio correlates inversely vaccine effectiveness, 0.30 hazard ratio means 70% effectiveness mentioned text. However, can't make sense tables pages 4-5 appendix looks like 45% effectiveness 3 days post-dose 1, followed 3% effectiveness days 4-6 post-dose 1, on. anyone clarify hazard ratios me?

* Pfizer may trouble modifying vaccine meet new variants resistant current vaccine, unable produce effective unified multi-variant vaccine.

* Pfizer may able meet future demand. Remember EU could vaccinate faster they're getting production Pfizer plus production would got Novavax, Curevac, etc.

* New side effects/unexpected long term side effects may yet discovered Pfizer jab.

I'm psyched mRNA vaccine tech too, unnecessary gamble EU place eggs one basket *again*, really know better now. so, like virus comes contagious covid much deadly, killing millions people US alone. force then?

AZ vaccine approved USA, letting sit there. Unfortunately, COVID crisis turned everyone nationalist showing compassion countries considered bad political strategy. Doctor's note due medical history makes sense, religious exclusion folks need fired too. week 2?? Wow yeah... I'm really sure understand mindset all... want everything open also want get vaccinated... Like uhhhh. Wat sure hope so. handful us job vaccinated I'm told bunch say never ever. retail around lot people. understand attitude all. pandemic, unvaccinated person could infect/kill people. precautions keep us alive well. body, get vaccinated could infect people's bodies. Totally agree Read last two sentences post. drove hundred miles LA Bakersfield get shot taking walk-ins. wonder many died/will die Covid lack access vaccine initial efficacy/safety testing.

The answer astonishing amount unfortunately Biden tells CDC they're allowed tell us vaccines stop spread. RN here. Fifty percent respiratory therapy staff routinely refuses flu shots allowed to, wear masks season. I've vaccine, I'm people getting it, VOLUNTARILY. see legal force upon adult want it. also see employer legally fire someone refusing unless part new hire agreement time hired. opposed what, figuratively never? Actually done past. See: Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905). U.S. Supreme Court sided state resident challenged smallpox vaccination requirement fine refused. precedent stills stands. vaccinated threat public health, governments lot power punish people refuse comply. 

I would love see forced vaccination anything potential spread widely course ordinary social interactions (eg anything airborne.) Exemptions must place people legitimate medical conditions make vaccination unsafe, list specific require documentation. 

We wouldn‚Äôt even conversation didn‚Äôt huge number people country demand access society without actually respecting social contract. want part society, part harm it- make choice regard. 

By refusing vaccination pandemic, person essentially elevating needs wants needs community, knowing choice harms community. anyone defending folks defending someone doesn‚Äôt give damn them. It‚Äôs like relationship narcissist... acknowledge situation stop allowing abused . narcissist never going care you. Vaccine-associated myocarditis happens number vaccines. Including smallpox vaccine. People need think terms probabilities realize number adverse events zero still small.

People need calm fuck straight down. Vaccination rates already slipping, area they're free taking nobody wants anymore. 100% agreed tied reopening horrific person must be. No, that's direct quote sentence quoted 1 million doses within demographic would also statistically prevent 12 covid deaths, 127 ICU admissions, 657 hospitalizations **among demographic** given current U.S. exposure comparison directly women 18-49. asking women 18-49 potentially sacrifice life save older demographic. make sense all. numbers roughly same, I've seen 80-90% efficacy 2+ weeks first dose, ~65% reduction new infections population one dose (vs 75% two). low end range good news, highlights extended dosing strategy going save lives - let (assumed) 'perfect' enemy good? second dose Pfizer arm I‚Äôm swearing checking states Covid numbers every day. Don‚Äôt need stress life anymore when/if person dies clot everyone already knows risk it. way REALLY reinforces idea government lying vaccines truth inevitably comes out. like Johnson Johnson entered link http://archive.today/ create link. link already created, link come up.

Headlines like scare people don‚Äôt read specifics. graph using absolute numbers, % excess mortality. agree you. internet, can't nitpick herd immunity understanding :) 
Can ever reach herd immunity? Every country highly globally connected now. like Covid spread, new variant spread. high amount population vaccinated stop wearing masks. interestingly still achieved herd immunity due globalisation. understand that. also understand it‚Äôs used worldwide millions people. It‚Äôs experimental sense. That‚Äôs anti-vaxx ignorant messaging. likely?

This ""100% likely / 0% likely"" question, since conspiracy theory 0% likely. Throughout US countries, regular (or even increased!) flu testing done past year.

The positivity rate flu tests incredibly small.

Washing hands, wearing masks, social distancing gathering large groups basically killed flu humans. Covid lot contagious, measures work supress covid enough prevent hospitals collapsing enough get flu R&lt;1. means limited number flu cases, since people catch flu somehow give less 1 person average.

And I‚Äôm telling wrong. statistics change look perspective individual people. healthy fit 20-year-old woman one cares making decision entirely selfish basis, chances getting significantly sick vaccine vs covid chances dying? think would better statistic show people grouping healthy young women unhealthy middle aged women (and groups between, realize lots middle aged women healthier younger women, I'm trying show wide range choosing healthiest unhealthy assume healthy 20 year old handle covid better healthy 40 year old). I'm saying right make decision selfishly think risks vaccine somehow significant enough avoid taking (I data, trust experts, namely CDC), think people could make argument. Plus gotta take account fact probably take Pfizer 2 weeks supposedly safer. Emergency Use, it‚Äôs different fucking horrible dude doctors informed handle clots differently clots, presumably resolved.  Enjoy well earned holiday! Placebo means unvaccinated, confusion?

It's clear right 1 dose differ 2 dose, papers say one dose 65% effective, say 80. yes Canadians need higher percentage Israel Israel specifically excluded previously positive cases (10% population) first vaccine rollout, 40% vaccinated actually 50% immune. also lose job. rolls far many jobs. is? group Facebook (#vaxfam)which includes COVID vaccine phase trial participants around world.I read people seeing side affects 2nd shot.  things happen  US fall came able use JnJ.

Take look graph (if all) western countries accurate statistics 1918. study American history find overwhelming amounts material time period, population data every county country. US census measuring population 200 years now. NL age restrict J&amp;J either. Since need AZ 2nd dose everyone first dose given million AZ first doses already, I‚Äôd say June surplus. Dutch recommendation applies first doses; everyone first dose AZ get second dose AZ regardless age. Yes worry, Brazilian Indian variants. We‚Äôre done yet. Ya got me.

I think bit funny people rightly identify nasty nationalistic certain sections media countries whilst utterly blind bias coming elements own. know British tabloids -particularly- bad, believing media utterly devoid elements seems pretty nationalistic itself. countries dicks report them.

But fair enough, I'm equivalent pointing hypocrisy Brexit bunch angry Daily Express readers here, I'll happily take downvotes! Unfortunately isn‚Äôt near worst case scenario yet. got edited  Population like 230% since vaccinated

They, is, scientific community, still don‚Äôt know long vaccines effective neither you. all. people actually get ""sick"" flu vaccine. Many people often get mild flu-like symptoms receiving flu vaccine, actually body's immune response vaccine rather actual illness.

Many things people associate sick actually body's response infection rather something caused infection itself. Fever, particular, notable example. actually get infected virus, one many things body fight infection raise temperature; reason elevated temperature inhibit viral reproductive cycle make infection easier fight off.

Why happen people vaccine well? traditional vaccines based either weakened inactive viruses. reasoning behind gives body's immune system chance recognize virus, essentially train destroy ever comes contact again. That's develop ""immunity"" specific disease; body already identified essentially stationed soldier cells recognize know kill it. Even though vaccine generally (except rare cases) actually cause real infection, body recognizes presence foreign particles triggers immune response often includes fever (because body necessarily ""know"" infected, activates mechanisms fighting infection).

The new COVID-19 vaccines (at least Pfizer Moderna ones, I'm sure them) actually entirely different anything we've used before, instead using weakened inactivated viruses actually based mRNA literally zero chance causing actual infection. would take lot typing explain question asked, I'm happy explain curious well. Profits vaccine drop bucket J&amp;J. Revenue 22B/quarter What? FDA approved vaccine. months ago. interesting, thanks educating me. hope India gets control somehow. instance, household attack rate 15-20 percent.

Offtopic, know happy makes read that. live someone Covid still without symptoms I've dreading looking statistic case higher. Yes that's true valid point. time, incredible really acknowledged widely. personally think twice putting daughter birth control if/when time comes wants cross bridge, consider (which always been). feel larger issue brought light people throwing hands might impact Yes damn evil teachers wanting put danger kids way parents get back working ground providing rich. read actual study article based on. link study article. got vaccinated. agree. JJ efficacy shown increase time. trial study results show numbers two weeks post shot. look forward official numbers 4/8 weeks.  It‚Äôs experimental. don‚Äôt need worry that. India stage? Rather earlier? always case vaccination. don‚Äôt require people medically can‚Äôt get vaccine vaccinated. Also religious exemption isn‚Äôt taken face value. India? now?

Why large wave start with? obvious reason pattern? people world still need vaccines. good ones there, especially cheaper and/or easier make and/or distribute, faster things improve. also reduce chance something coming around variants percolating seething cauldrons unvaccinated around world. less spreads, less chances mutation less chance mutation make dangerous way. road everyone vaccinated Covid problem anymore.   nothing poor rich.India extremely overpopulated country denying Oh oh then. might boned Pfizer really seems incredible job. It‚Äôs also wild people perpetuating idea mRNA vaccines alter DNA mRNA isn‚Äôt even entering cell nucleus. problems AZ JnJ real. Aw, engage them, funny see get desperate. one difference

However majority 3rd world nations vaccinated people meaningful way; none except Brazil getting hit way India now

South Africa one example, cases far lower though vaccination rates low  Decent read, good stuff think give take thing evolutionary things tend be. Like every 5% less efficacy vaccine variant give 5% infectiousness. Lets generalize people India, everyone lives slum. Many huge bungalows, hit Covid.

Even rich WFH class hit

And even wave, slums seeing less excess deaths middle upper middle classes  Canadian here. Please send AZ India, us. much better vaccines enough scheduled deliveries give every single adult one dose within next 2 months. India people suffocating death hospitals oxygen.

So ehmmm what‚Äôs happening virus? Super deadly infectious? talk 3rd dose pfizer vaccine, experts predicted vaccine immunity could wane 12 months hence suggesting third dose. 
There direct proof 4 months extend immunity , hypothesized vaccine immunity wane year. vaccinate 1st, wait 4 months , vaccinate 2nd extending time protection decreases. Plus know first dose alone highly effective No. Covid19 cases declined constantly throughout year government/everyone dropped guard. government, particular, absolutely fucked acted like India achieved herd immunity. anything increase vaccine production, gave away vaccines countries, generally incompetent arrogant. virus enough breeding ground come dangerous mutations.  never done full pause all.

Increased hesitancy vaccine, vaccines, cause far deaths.

Do source this? 

The concern commenter seemed 4 months could lose window opportunity lock extended immunity. heard currently good idea viable length window. Excess death takes account regular rate people dying things. reason death accounted excess death, death itself

we see pattern x amount people die year, number exceeds amount excess death.

In 1918 fly pandemic last two years 675000 people died expected. Shame positive news coming Brazil get attention negative. Oh üòÆ gonna die ? dying past ? But... No? I'm Denmark. 30 years old. forecasted get vaccine late August earliest.

Please keep open mind reading anything. Including this. know me. know. motivation writing this. thankfully there's least lot peer review helps bring order chaos spin.

And like said, would least people scared covid less. real danger us insanely fucking dumb nothing help reduce spread disease. that, absolutely blame media, politicians, celebrities, influencers, etc. know quickly people believe something want hear much bad information spread leads people skip vaccination, masks, staying home infected, etc. Paywall. might valid EUR, US, lot others, NZ China chance catching Covid-19 much lower people eventually get infected contribute herd immunity. Narrator: not, public health bureaucrats claimed ‚Äúrisk still high‚Äù situation ‚Äúworse Covid started‚Äù despite vaccinating 70% population. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going Germany least. Merkel Spahn completely lost it. Nepal South Asia. Fuck AMLO, could job one hand tied behind back.

Heck, going another, nineteenth lockdown row curfew starting today. None makes sense rational standpoint anymore. agree every word wrote here, Ian. Thank saying it. No. That's part reason people annoyed US holding them. Personally put lot blame AZ awful they've Europe, seem like acting competently.  it? end WWI gas masks could seal deadly gas technology definitely whether could build distribute enough civilian medical use different matter:  already said would willing release ips temporarily since government paid bulk them.

So I'm sure point is. I'm saying handing current surplus vaccines them. need pay manufacturing. Seems agreement. don‚Äôt believe use v-safe since fully vaccinated 3 months. thought collecting data vaccinated within last 6 weeks. gained 7 pounds 127 bad covid is, could way worse virus might waiting us (think longer incubation period, difficult detect, even difficult treat deadly). So, understand issue is.  Tourists banned year anyways. 

This article largely pointless.   gotta love people always like ""...more people die 'insert something dumb' 'insert actual danger' "", people actually cared people dying thing. like anything thing, something thing. 

It's people give fuck always like that. Shitty people care try manipulate people nothing positive.  Got first Moderna shot last week tender arm couple days things good.

Live life again. like Florida give fuck.  Aside: you‚Äôre U.S. buy home tests CVS, could test every time comes wanted.  know counting used go 1915, 1916, 1917, 1919. 1918. Deep state invented number 1918 take away feedom /s (Canada US citizens outside US). Like least done ship vaccines US Consulates. That's reason think huge, huge portion defense budget needs allocated creating mRNA based vaccines hypothetical mutations different viruses. already know possible ways avian flu could mutate contagious, deadly virus. making vaccine happens, safety thoroughly researched even patient zero.

Making vaccines possible viruses needs thing. Ideally we'll never need them. let's think back two years imagine American government developed vaccine hypothetical SARS virus uses spike protein interface ACE2 receptors. vaccine knew safe, could quickly manufacture distribute.

Let's assume still take four months distribute 300,000,000 dosees. would mean May 2020, four months first case reported United States, we'd vaccinated hundred million people many, many partially vaccinated. *never* would pandemic kind vaccine research done advance.

This sounds insane impossible, I'm convinced worth researching kind thing really could save us ever deal ""next time."" took Moderna *[two develop vaccine. *Two days.* sequencing virus, Chinese government even confirmed could transmitted humans.

If combine research hypothetical virus mutations we've decades massive fortune knowledge we've learned mRNA vaccines pandemic, really could looking paradigm shift discussion novel viruses. know would work, know we're next pandemic try creating vaccines hypothetical viruses, especially virus whose mutations posited before, we'd regretting deeply blaming every death failure attempt this. could work. I've seen lot numbers thrown around 70-90%

Sasha Baron Cohen interviewed bunch conspiracy nuts, quickly managed get call others beliefs dumb. different religious people think religion truth every religious person misguided believes nonsense. ten twenty percent people 

Get vaccine. USA targeting entire pop. 


You need start giving away produced enough everyone. words, position changed situation changed new evidence emerged? Efficacy meaning what? Preventing symptomatic infection? Severe disease? preventing infection? Holy fuck, I‚Äôm talking vaccinated people sucking other‚Äôs dicks safely, I‚Äôm talking individual vaccinated person wear mask social distance. you‚Äôre opinion wearing mask required even you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre denying science behind vaccine essentially admitting don‚Äôt think works.

Why binary thing? I'm looking evidence studies vaccine offers around 60-80% protection asymptomatic disease 70-90% symptomatic disease, depending vaccine many doses. absolutely isn't/wasn't given that:

1. Vaccinated people cause asymptomatic spread;
2. minority still became symptomatic, particularly, spread nearly effectively unvaccinated.

A 70-90% reduction symptoms brilliant, definitely success story, still leaves vaccine working minority time. throw things someone's head they're wearing hard hat; breathe COVID unnecessarily vaccinated. want know happen az. Bavaria Both. Check locked thread Israel. reduces chance infection lot, reduces chance severe disease dramatically, reduces chance hospitilisation even further, may reduce chances dying nothing. Potentially dangerous, aside maybe drunk driving, average dumb citizen isn‚Äôt much endanger public health regular basis. Nobody forcing somebody go university lot offer online alternatives somebody doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated exceptions. Work places aren‚Äôt mandating vaccines legal grey zone university voluntary transaction. way stadiums requiring vaccines atm.

Even cut 50 percent arrivals amount covid around places still high.

Even negative test flight work maybe stop saying ""they're scalping world"" collecting Nobel Prizes highest estimates go 100 million actually. Florida reported another 7k cases day again. Vaccine sites empty area. I'm sure things getting better florida. Going warmer months everyone inside too. 4-16 days symptom onset AZ vaccine, data looking like exact syndrome. Would rather ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù update guidance new information comes along? Starting 12 hours second shot, felt crappy one day. Tylenol, got 10 hours sleep, I‚Äôm fine. arm even less sore first shot, that‚Äôs probably actually focused moving arm around getting extra electrolytes. 100% would again. blame US stopped exporting. India same, stopped exporting vaccines poorer countries saw growth infections.

Implying US Indias vaccine policies similar disingenous best.

India exported around 70 mil vaccines cooperates global vaccine manufacturing, US full export ban sabotaged global vaccine manufacturing reserving right confiscate vaccines manufactured outside US. Pfizer offered sell India early pandemic condition given liability cover / indemnity shield. government refused. 

All governments agreed indemnity cover someone want get vaccine, ability get vaccine, affect you. Kids less susceptible flu danger ones dont get shot. That's like someone owns gun saying non gun owner stupid protecting family. person's choice demand pretty much available, matter gets want can. may apply to, widely available. reference got vaccine, people shaming others getting truly better anti vaxxers trying get take it. saw interview Fauci several weeks ago basically said ""Infected people probably can't spread disease, we're waiting studies finish know sure."" 

He's trying get ahead science - one study hardly definitive, downside wrong huge. 

 

I sympathize - wait tables tell much harder connect people I'm wearing mask. shall pass, hopefully soon. Japan mask culture yet flu still spreads.

People expect get viruses strangers stuff like family gatherings workplaces spreads. People let guard down. dangerous even before, ignored it. Think mask mandates remain effect awhile longer. would love see restaurants required post percentage employees vaccinated could decide ones go to, never happen. Easier loosen masks required. live free state, chosen stay away many things. getting statistics antibodies? Everything read conflicting information antibodies antibodies that. trust body get tested antibodies months. seatbelt analogy? getting shot seatbelt? India (or whatever country) would footing bill setting factories would produce generic brand Moderna vax J&amp;J vax whatever. 

Beyond that, releasing IP countries produce versions allowing pandemic continue longer needs to, increasing chances vaccine resistant strand developing. also harmful global economy harmful already low reputation USA rest world Free cancellation, yes, holidays got much expensive believe move holiday free charge. Mumbai plateaued since last 15 days. Research couple months 1 shot mRNA effective JJ. IMO JJ divert entire supply India. They‚Äôre dying thousands right now.  differ.

One things like other: 

The hospitals areas absolutely smashed. USA running oxygen treating people (bearly) streets cars. 

When USA freezer trucks car park, bad. India apparently incinerating bodies car park, also really bad. 

We dont need whataboutisms, situation certain cities, undeniably shit. read article said mensural changes could due relief getting vaccine shouldn‚Äôt hold economy anti-vaxxers. Open things back get sick, get sick. think Covid conspiracy theory anyway.

Then stopped taking seriously. hard come back second dose.

For maybe step shoes minute. 

There many populations challenge. People without stable living situations aren‚Äôt nearly likely get second dose, even first matter. 1 shot option available useful specifically mentioned ACIP slide deck. 

At end day it‚Äôs informed consent. segment society wants vaccine whatever reason, long they‚Äôre fully aware risks let it. Reasons blame CoronaVirus 2nd wave completely Modi Government

1.	‚Å†‚Å†They allow foreign vaccines. Said we're self sufficient Indian. allow private firms manufacture COVIDSHIELD COVAXIN.

And also time component: even small droplets drift down..

So ABSOLUTELY makes difference whether 6ft 60ft away. Thank you! Time calculation important comparing statistics! Previous data revealed variant lowered antibody levels sixfold laboratory tests.

Umm what? I‚Äôm thinking statement corrected author. Virus variants don‚Äôt lower antibody levels. I‚Äôm sure mean neutralizing antibodies less effect variants. haven't. They've saying vaccinated people hang together, admit truth vaccinated people go live normal life without mask.

If think goal public health measures prevent collapse healthcare systems make disease ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù, initially intended countries back Spring 2020, yes. resounding success, managed avoid collapse without significant disruptions life well protection human rights economy.

If think goal sole priority should‚Äôve minimize deaths cases much possible, average response. better Europe worst Nordic counterparts. Hugs bro! altruism. UK EU member January 1st authorized vaccines rest EU negotiated better European Commission (which really experience things, national governments normally public health EU)

And finally, one could argue lot exports purposeful altruism, failure limit exports.

But overall, mind lagging behind US UK 2 months. inevitable countries would first others would not.
As long lag behind 6 months. America selfish. 
Every government's responsibility prioritize citizens. 


The Indian government ample time get raw material else where. 
The ban placed Trump government several months ago.

Ohh know agree. found little funny comment humans bad evaluating risk, example provided (if talking JNJ vaccine) overstating risk factor 100.

The thing old school vaccines make labor intensive grow cultures. hand mrna vaccines guarantee work have, vaccine time table jumped forward years. make shitton way effective thought possible.

So answer question, make sense now. vaccine roll years away peak production made sense get good geopolitical deals place token amount somewhat effective vaccines. Indians blame USA.

1. ban started Trump era
2. India Govt ample time give orders procure raw materials advance. orders like overnight Amazon orders. get raw materials April one needs give orders advance Jan-Feb, Ofcourse Govt sleeping pushing blame game
3. India always option going 200 countries, dependent USA though?
4. USA seen 500K deaths twice number cases full right support people. Biden announced plan vaccinate 100% USA 4th July companies working it.
5. India got serious raw materials situation getting totally control. blamed USA instead.
6. Modi shifting blame. Modi's incompetent leadership lead this.
7. India recently many big gathering events like Farmers protest, Kumbh Mela, Election campaigns, Wedding Season(Indian weddings huge least 50 people max 1000 people) Ramazan prayers.

Well, fuck 'em. refused get vaccinated point, nobody blame themselves. Let natural selection make example people refuse vaccine. Question. people spread virus someone vaccinated? would person normal problems would asymptomatic? Btw great asking questions.  I'm Mandatory vaccinations means ending terrible restrictions preventing Covid Chaos. 

People willing make ""sacrifices"" anti mask. sacrifice make things open everyone. agree vaccines would normally call ""proper testing"". seen many people around die COVID. Many friends lost parents, even heard guy lost 4 brothers... mind, think safe outwheights chances getting sick future. Anyway, fair point well. could however little better messaging make getting vaccine appealing. Mask wearing recommended/optional individual businesses whether want mandate mask wearing business certain % population vaccinated. Otherwise, people say what's point, get vaccinated mandates still place. entire pandemic

India last year went hard lockdown mode large cities. Like riot police tear gas hard. Supposedly lifted lot social holidays BOOM outbreak. less healthy food options

What really sucks people immune compromised unable get vax get shit end sticks. really said procedure (which use, healthcare community settings) reusable N95 exhale valve, regular disposable ""surgical"" mask it. second mask filters exhales, keeps N95 cleaner. big deal filters readily available again, really nice change N95 (and unmask so) every time something gets splashed it. Heck, even non-infectious-disease setting still like second mask point keeps N95 getting instantly soiled soot/brake dust/pollen.

And yeah, also situations wear either P100 PAPR (certain healthcare settings and, ironically, welding - though that's rather different piece headgear!) surgical mask (situations tbh mask probably needed hey, makes people comfortable, mind putting piece cloth face). go mask-both-required-and-needed areas N95 surgical it. is.

I agree 100%.

Ideally information would get ASAP process. know places good providing details vaccines provided well advance. Ideally could know always possible.

I also hope CDC develops guidance clearly explaining risks situations like talking about. info provided vaccine clinic. evidence around things like long covid heart damage blood clots catching covid vaccine?

Those things still happen people seemingly mild covid symptoms still caused serious internal damage.

Can‚Äôt say disagree here. Dr. Fauci still wants remain cautious, 80 although excellent health time side, think that‚Äôs great personal decision. words actions persuading get vaccinated, jumped shark speak. would 30 year old blue collar worker get vaccinated told media, right wrong put Dr. Fauci prominent role, get vaccinated doesn‚Äôt see maskless, restrictionless future? 


Thoughts? people infected hoarding oxygen? Like hospitals hoarding actual patients? fact still flu deaths would prove isnt true, based logic.  Ship anywhere FFS. obvious America never use them. AZ even *submitted* vaccine FDA approval yet. 

Every day sit American warehouses, directly costing lives. American say what, that's responsibility, totally right. America used stand something better. Wasn‚Äôt one things covid kids damaged blood vessels Many people know gained pounds lost weight too. personally lost 110lbs year recently put 10 back worried lost much. muscle loss new 10lbs partially muscle gain. home cooking meals big part it.

Also random donuts office anymore lol lost 35lbs since april 2020. also first pull life 2 days ago! i‚Äôm 30, 6ft2, male i‚Äôve never felt healthier.  still got long way go. i‚Äôm 220lbs target 190 year ends stayed since eat meals usually healthy. Totally agree. least try make case don‚Äôt need anymore (if that‚Äôs want). Don‚Äôt let push around it‚Äôs want! realized something today. Back anti-vax Jenny McCarthy ""I know what's best baby"" sort thing, argument made people appreciate vaccines diseases like polio around experience large outbreaks polio, realize bad things great vaccines were.

But see that's false. We've Covid-19 year, 500K Americans dead...and people still appreciate vaccine. pandemic seriously exacerbated mental health issues lot people. know ever serious bout depression, makes lose lot energy simple tasks become much harder complete. ridiculous suggest blaming pandemic cop many people would fine last year pandemic.

2. experience far typical. absolutely heartbreaking.

Its estimated 5'000 people per day dying know about, figure could easily double.

Truth never know true extent many people die from. Covid-19 India. live New England, learned ski year. 30 I‚Äôm disgusted struggle find motivation fix ughhhhhh. here. realized day I've eating, literally like there's tomorrow. Suddenly acknowledged going die covid better change evil ways. monitoring sugar salt intake, working reducing alcohol consumption (and good success it).

I see articles saying new ""Roaring 20s"" pandemic control; sort think resurgence austerity, compensate past year reckless living, healthwise anyway. related news, 39% Americans lie gaining weight pandemic. vaccines mandatory middle high school students least stop quarantining vaccinated kids? needs incentive vaccinate. Alternative headline: Fat Americans Self Control Get Fatter Amen sure still ban flights India. kind ""advisory"" means nothing. heard freshman 15. COVID 19. lakhs = 100,000 

for Americans Don‚Äôt forget look confidence intervals. findings efficacy second dose statistically indistinguishable Pfizer‚Äôs originally reported number 94% effective. oh shit yeah forgot global covid sub wonder many doses given year. 7B? American say what, that's responsibility, totally right.

This simply ""You wrong, asshole"" meme situation. March last October lost ab 10% weight. worked get back months, got Covid early April lost again. hardest part isn‚Äôt even gaining weight, it‚Äôs rebuilding habit eat regularly. busy work, especially work home doesn‚Äôt help Lost 30 pounds hit goal January 1st April...is April again....25pounds go lol ...You know exercise home, right? checking lol Quite me. 210 250. 228 can‚Äôt lose pound save life ironically puts higher risk dying pandemic. I‚Äôm 100lbs since December. bariatric surgery cost fortune got paid lucky quirk fate. surely everyone it! forgot magic ingredient. Stress üëç turned drinking water drinking wine. similar experience. Start lockdown weight bloomed. Thankfully 6 months managed put brakes working reversing it. able work home privilege makes much less susceptible covid broken.

Hospitals completely run, oxygen supplies virtually non existence, estimated 5,000 people per day dying increase daily next month least.

Its heartbreaking I'm US citizen Canada got consulate email STEP advisory placed Canada Level 4- Avoid travel due Covid resurgence. aren‚Äôt vaccinated. 

Yeah every reason stand ground. Seriously, 61% improvement South.  Wanna gear something worse?
They even banned import raw materials used manufacturing India  United States still need millions second doses. think guys close saturation point, quite yet. makes sense share doses, Biden administration it. Thats absolutely mind blogging think about. remember reading many young people died 1918 Spanish flu, average life expectancy dropped 12-13 years fuckin gym closed Keto fix you. I‚Äôm operations manager cemetery chain, I‚Äôve lost weight, obvious reasons. This! home near kitchen bad. Going office, could bring lunch gone, done eating went home. Trump instead Biden, Reddit would arms. suppose, much deal now.

I mean kind amplifies rest world, really matter power US, same. Instead arguments, compare US/UK data. realize following UK strategy people end dead. Fair enough. vaccinated quarantine. let parents around kids vaccinated got vaccinated ASAP back January. heck parents vaccinated?! Like justice, oxygen delayed oxygen denied. fyi, others:
lahk = 100 000
crore = 10 000 000 People still lazy. Buying bike doesn‚Äôt mean using said. said ""61% people reported undesired weight **CHANGE**"" including weight loss. study done way guarantee results looking **BAD** study. Canada's supply massively reduced problems supply chain Europe problems behind us. There'd vaccines available US taken lion's share. research came mutations, course, absolutely never 100%. that‚Äôs deal risks usually. % risk minuscule able lose almost 40! lost weight got best shape life.

Being laid months gave chance finally time explore region hikes, camping riding bicycle. 

Nothing beat living rural semi wild regions. Absolute freedom. Never spent time outdoors past year. would sue ass confidence intervals.

Of
Your actions Dude..... trade-off. Planning meals, buying groceries, preparing meals takes skill, time, attention.

If missing *any* 3, going get intended results. 

Way many people know make healthy tasty food, learning takes time attention

If exhausted work stress (gestures everything past year), going able pay much attention food preparation needs. find missing ingredients getting timing wrong steps sides cold main dish done. 

And, course, takes *time*, might due telecommuting, might less everything takes longer COVID restrictions.

So takeout delivery happen afford them, frozen pizza can't. Somewhat ironically, messaging like often causes vaccine hesitancy. people keep told vaccine hesitancy others means can't go back ""normal"" anyway, they're less likely go 'trouble' vaccinated seems like there's clear benefit... totally took opposite approach fear life. went little exercise daily minimum 100 push-ups, 5 10 mile hikes, 8 hours sleep, strict vegan diet plenty veggies, fruits, nuts, beans. fear catching covid. wanted body strong. 

Never felt better. I‚Äôve lost 30lbs second shot? seems odd, almost people know, took vaccine reaction next day. Please get checked doesn‚Äôt subside. sure covid test. wife started eating better working January 2020 pandemic. covid hit neither us much appetite weeks without realizing it, lost ton weight rather quickly. ended losing 30 pounds (170 140) overall. overweight glad lose pounds 140 went far. put back 5 pounds feels right. Never thought would get back high school weight feels pretty darn good. 3000 years ago relevant, us living now. poor, us planning to. got Pfizer #1 yesterday, France. start finish, walking pharmacy, getting prescription popping vax location took 2 hours total. know 39% Americans food insecure found one, exactly like said, feels close enough. can't find one matches exactly. That‚Äôs great! gained 10 lbs too, I‚Äôm 30 since December. Going back work definitely helped China shut travel within country happy let flights go around world. Right, masks, travel restrictions etc. needed years. zero. I'm saying risky, giving number/level risk, zero say ""so far"" we're far. That's enough fully vaccinate 1% India entire population. might sound like lot could save 30 people 3000 dying day. learned cook really good pastas. üòÖ

But actually problem I‚Äôm bit mentally fried cook mid-week. Sunday-Tuesday I‚Äôm eating healthy Wednesdays-Saturday give order doordash.

I‚Äôm 20 lbs mix fat muscle. went able hold plank able one three half minutes, pushups clap now. üòÇ Wow...your comment dumb can‚Äôt even decipher it. Jeez. needed extra 10 pounds gained. Let's hope stays think need many else? Give people saline sell vaccine. 100% nobody say anything safety new mutations detected every 1-2 months. Thanks sharing, friend mine covid much worse reaction vaccine, impression people previous covid worse reaction vaccine didn‚Äôt get covid. quite yet, forget 2nd doses Less healthy food options? Grocery stores still open. I‚Äôm better shape. It‚Äôs choices people make effort put in.  Lots China apologists online. mess fault China. US taxpayer already first dibs these. one's asking US give away vaccines actually going use. people traveling? Gotcha Jesus, how?? We're civilized developed countries. /s

We bring tons refrigerated trucks hold bodies die streets seen everyone else. That's good want hopefully everything work Dude you‚Äôre exaggerating uncomfortable is. Wearing mask annoying sleeping socks on. loathe unvaccinated RNs (except ones legitimately can't get vaccine, example one best RNs underwent chemo can't get vaccinated). work around newborn babies think vaccine refusal irresponsible. Uh ... no.

Flu scientifically proven LESS CONTAGIOUS COVID. 

What mean?

It means wearing masks socially distancing affect flu affect COVID. Therefore it‚Äôs surprise two viruses competing via aerosol hosts infectious contagious one winning.

You fundamentally don‚Äôt understand whole life thing works. people teach critical thinking Yes. Based results global trial, J&amp;J's vaccine 66.9% effective preventing moderate severe/critical Covid-19 14 days single-dose vaccine, 66.1% effective 28 days dose. United States, vaccine 85.9% effective severe forms Covid-19. 



First 85.9% quite different 99.9%. Second, real issue single dosing MRNA work, tested trials can't say sure. countries reporting great real world results first dose, official trial data.

However, sure would odd something effective preventing infection all, yet somehow way less effective preventing severe cases, given working conditioning immune system attack virus.  got science back up? op-eds, feelings, sweet YouTube ""research""? literally never report news pointing chances death hospitalization people. numbers incredibly low they're probably afraid one would pay attention anymore. bet delight parties. vaccinations start opening general public, hope Canadian universities also require vaccinations students attend fall classes year. I‚Äôll gladly line mine. really, plateauing seeing less people want/need get vaccinated. also people tightly packed cities etc. shutting mass vaccination sites enough people showing up. downward trend means everyone wants get vaccine it. Great news I‚Äôm sure state travel ban is, many people always ability travel case due dual citizenship/permanent residency statuses. graduate student many Indian peers, example, return India time choose. mean that‚Äôs inevitability necessity human immune system... mean, President Taft 350 lbs 1913‚Ä¶  fact flu deaths happen anymore perfect example.

Sorry, fact. Many people died without getting tested, particularly early stages. previous common cold coronaviruses. Look - last time happened late 1800s. time people thought flu, know coronavirus.  60+ group Hamburg even inform post this. 

No :P agree sufficiently control, masks necessary. Though miss getting sick. media point rare specific examples young people getting sick covid never report real statistics show extremely rare? comparing death rates (deaths per 100,000 people). seeing reason decided that, now. March told schools would halt funding force Hybrid kids back school cohort model April. course wanted justification teachers vaccinated first gave leg stand on. 

Too bad parents willing actually send kids back school work. parents NOT.

Last week received board notes last WLWV meeting honest goodness trying send K-12 kids back 5 days week school end school year. failed tried high school. also failed.

Not sure point even would been. Let kids get vaccinated they‚Äôre forced go back. They‚Äôre going get sick is, mingling germ pools isolated long, let‚Äôs throw COVID mix, too. don‚Äôt know exactly. years? decades? millennia? long life Earth? US fact vaccines authorized emergency use rather full FDA approvals complicates things legally companies. full FDA approval given imagine you‚Äôll see hospitals nursing homes require (and businesses too). comparing death rate, raw numbers! long saying ""Deliveries going pick weeks?"" 

except... has? significantly? like, like stay uninformed purpose write troll people? next 2 weeks getting 6 million doses, BioNTech/Pfizer. total Germany received 28115746 doses, 7 million per month. see massive increase? also know get 7 million per month every month, started fewer first months increased following months? won‚Äôt necessary. France man may want look term ""death rate"" ""deaths per 100,000 people"" considered sexy

citation needed. 3 million know :-/ can't ignore social behaviour differences. least could afford lockdown lockdown last year. residential block even kids play together park whole 2020.

But year celebrated republic day (Jan), Lohri (Feb), Holi (March) big gatherings. Issues vaccines show quickly. don‚Äôt develop time. it‚Äôs shitty situation, people work pandemic aren‚Äôt hoarding money would otherwise spend restaurants, increase spending elsewhere, like buying stuff online. means, online retailers, logistic centers manufacturers needs workforce. Maybe temporarily rent stuff? need help people. baby earlier year. sides family constantly fighting us won‚Äôt let hold baby inside her. I‚Äôve told it‚Äôs simple. want hold baby quarantine, mean actually quarantine, yet one wants part. Im fucking loss here. don‚Äôt know do. want grandparents see baby can‚Äôt anything happen her. 

Any thoughts? Going common little bit. Remember, small number people 90% effective vaccine virus spreads unchecked elsewhere community, going cases group. community vaccinated, look transmission possibility one vaccinated person another, another 90% reduction. Breakthrough cases become increasingly rare population vaccinated. Right need get vaccines people

that never problem US: nah we'll let 20 million AZ sit storage maybe we'll loan later point believe AZ chimp JJ human Yes includes J&amp;J, doesnt include extra Biontech doses (+700.000 Q2) doubt adjustments big.

Nobody knows verdict J&amp;J... guess good (it used everyone). fucking conspiracy theory, reality. mean covid real, mean killed people, yes covid deaths overwhelmingly overstated. There's question. disagree.

Science consensus. Sure Scientists disagree, burden proof invalidate plethora studies published generally accepted.

Good dad going get work said they're going give $250 bonus take it. scheduled appointment next day Yes, please study long term consequences spike protein body. wonder first time ever used spike protein vaccine? personally feel US begin help countries resources (even slightly) honestly think resources send could help large scale? India's population absolutely massive. 

I'll admit know ton subject, I'm talking sheer numbers fact plenty allies helping either far know. can‚Äôt comprehend moved date year. Good. Get everyone vaccinated!! super important. trials conducted different times viral spread dramatically different time points. really way compare two deadly virus, host ends dying chance pass normally, deadly virus doesn‚Äôt kill host quickly spread quickly People deny holocaust, dinosaurs, round earth exist. things shock anymore. isn‚Äôt mystery. Big elections lifted stopped enforcement. Also big religious holiday. has. haven‚Äôt heard Astros triple variant yet? Man. Scary stuff. 

(No not) Yeah, March hit everyone like truck brief month seemed united slowing spread. month later fatigue doubt started set comparisons ‚Äúthe flu‚Äù began arise. Debates masks followed, sentiment mitigation efforts Covid started build since get we‚Äôve witnessed past year.

It middle end summer last year pretty much knew would ‚Äúfend yourself‚Äù type situation. Stores didn‚Äôt start making people wear masks around August, believe. mask felt like protection others people started wearing more. still remember weekend big realization mid March people store looked weird people masks gloves on. weekend week, ones getting looks nothing on.

Holidays destroyed us seemed get worse worse progressed big ones end year. believe main culprit simply family gatherings rather possible efforts private businesses around time. Decided pick Xmas gift ordered online mall got spaces packed. way things went inside long ass, ‚Äúsocially distanced‚Äù lines outside stores like 3 4 shoppers inside store time. banking able go underestimated amount Xmas shoppers pandemic.

Hopefully soon behind us people get shots protect better ways mask tried to. I‚Äôm really feeling summer masks start leaving debates start shifting side people don‚Äôt want anymore. fall I‚Äôm sure masks laughed room society talks possible second round shots coming months begin. India Tokyo, dumbass. vaccines might preferable catching Covid, stop calling safe serious/fatal side-effects? disingenuous. And, let‚Äôs honest, obese people.  Unfortunately beginning unfold India :/ mean, compare fact deadly pandemics, completely different far viruses go. 

The Spanish Flu killed younger people MUCH higher rate. average age death 28. That‚Äôs actually insane. Thank god isn‚Äôt case covid. Chill buddy second Moderna yesterday morning gym workout.

Thus, important consider possibility SARS-CoV-2 spike protein produced new COVID-19 vaccines triggers cell signaling events promote PAH, cardiovascular complications, and/or complications tissues/organs certain individuals (Figure 3). need monitor carefully long-term consequences COVID-19 vaccines introduce spikeprotein human body.

I'll never educate again! 
Without knowledge powerless! need data approve reject. phase 3 results yet.

I suspect lot studies going similarly wide confidence interval. I‚Äôm little confused numbers 18-49 demographic 


Out 1million 12 Covid deaths prevented? come number? mean even dose gets administered 999,988 people still likelihood death Covid? People keep telling thing tiny chance killing people less 85 years old. None people pictures Delhi look old. outrages many people developed countries refusing vaccines people die droves. India exported millions vaccines abroad nobody even using. problem eradicate vaccinate 100% that's happening. 25% country want vaccine ever get matter happens... guess die get immune getting virus help going mutate like already get worse. requires Israel see Palestinians humans.  ""Lol fuck palestinians"" proud Israeli tradition, one continues COVID. data you‚Äôre saying?

Right seems mostly unrestricted infections cause ton mutations happen.

Vaccines curb infection thus mutation rate. idea waiting on? Sorry loss. Hang ‚ù§Ô∏è TIL. Thanks, I'm going incorporate similar-to-but-legally-distinct-from-Terminator spec script. Basically yeah. IIRC hospital hires people either act patient potential patient, kind chill around high traffic areas pay attention doctors nurses frequency using hand sanitizer washing hands. Floor supervisors also look it, think. can't remember specifics understood similar mystery shopper grocery stores hire assess employee performance. pass, employees get bonus. think salaried get it, hourly do, payroll 3 6 months. work home worry it, still get enjoy benefits well. 3rd straight day hospitalizations declining! Great stuff!   date 3 15 cases TTS led death 1 5. 

The projection 13 TTS cases every 1M J&amp;J shots given women 18-49.

So expect ~2 deaths per 1M shots, maybe slightly higher.

Obviously that‚Äôs based preliminary numbers currently available. need grow conscience help places - India Brazil, too. horrible what's happening there. know got nothing HVAC technician. Good! Maybe EU plans give 70% adult population least one dose COVID-19 vaccine July,

Canada going mid June. already ahead EU right going faster pace them.  concur! like we're back water, we're SF! think capable changing though. There's lot research show goddamn monkeys end.

You keep downvoting me. But, somewhere there, someone making policy force get vaccinated. Maybe keep health benefits, job, whatever.

I care hate know going use hate weapon. Covid give fuck. got laid job, went person remote learning, locked inside apartment, told boomers going die : ). 
Now tell situation better old person. 

Lost contact friends group due bullshit zoom able travel back home nearly two years. 

And think boomers worse? either retired worked home. Sure. Lots died lots lose jobs.

But can't tell easy, give everything, order save 80 something year old dying India‚Äôs excess deaths data difficult obtain. strange democracy. 

Reported daily deaths approximately 10,000 four weeks, real numbers easily double that. tragic many deaths could prevented slowed pandemic another month let elderly get vaccinated. know, noticed opposite year. family followed strict Covid protocol stayed home...had everything delivered curbside pickup...barely left house. zero illnesses year. Nothing all...not cold...not stomachache...nothing. usually stock cold meds winter months cause someone always gets sick. use year...the boxes still sealed. 12 Well, live right work state employer fire without cause. best could case decline vaccine time appointment try luck another facility. fairly easy get Pfizer Moderna vaccines MA; problem places may ease choice. Wow that's insane. way lot teachers' unions continued push back even teachers vaccinated drove wall, especially priority expense elderly. Sounds like case Oregon. might seeing result overly-restrictive rules bad distribution, eastern Oregon pretty whack probably low uptake % God people worried ‚Äòlong‚Äô COVID. anymore? excuse blocking exports one bit. **Side-effects Relapse?**

Got second Moderna shot 4/6 next day felt hit truck. Normal symptoms soreness, tiredness, easily breathe. Back 90% day after, 8th. past Tuesday 20th felt like slightly milder relapse day-after effect lasted two days, additional side effect ""pukey"" feeling lack hunger.

So started looking around seen anyone mention relapse *vaccine side effects*, relapses 2nd shot previous covid infection symptoms. spent past year girlfriend nearly every day neither us ever tested positive, tested around 5 times.

So, like, covid point know? happened anyone else? sucks tye damage public perception already done matter what, people leery J&amp;J vaccine going forward. mean generally agree you, wouldn‚Äôt want tiny baby get personally. don‚Äôt worry kids big. Also super high exposure particular job Yeah said f that, went drive trucks make ton cash. need piece paper smart. really need /s?

My country complete lockdown moment ICUs completely maxed due lack vaccine supply - province‚Äôs health authority allowing people die part triage less 70% chance survival save ventilators higher survival rate. 

Not situation would absolutely ‚Äúlit / cool‚Äù. Maybe weren‚Äôt always medically fragile, something changed (cancer, Diabetes, Immune disorder?) need keep job provides health insurance. J&amp;J vaccine still huge deal hard reach populations. shot health groups relying homeless particular. need protection pandemic much rest us ‚Äî arguably, need more! true we're point vaccine demand becoming lower vaccine supply US, J&amp;J vaccine still important domestically. 

Having used meaningful extent US important foreign adoption too. vaccine likely cover billions people developing world. need people trust see simply US' discarded scraps. Thank you. hope recovery swift. People scared microchips whatever bullshit. Compared who? probably right lets assume true. cases people getting Covid vaccinated. vaccine 100%...they recently outbreak nursing home vaccinated patients.

The issue got Covid all. issue even though 10 vaccinated residents test positive...they mostly asymptomatic none needed hospitalization treatment...and older patients lot health issues.

I vaccinated stay Covid negative. got vaccinated minimize chance might kill me, hospitalize me, lead long-term health issues. That's biggest benefit vaccine. 

And there's doubt even vaccinated people probably going need boosters near future due variants made worse anti-vaxxers people access vaccine. Technically right. However, emoyers must terminate every single employee, company wide, meet criteria. Otherwise terminated employee wrongful termination claim. employers go wrong giving reason, opens wrongful termination single someone out. refused give reason they'd better off. take lot processing power reach simple conclusion dystopian AF...

Totally agree points though Architect US, air exhausted building. retail /restaurants mandatory - see 1'-2' grill louver air vented inside out. countries they're much lax, india restaurants barely proper mechanical protocols Well spacing safe. question whether spacing help mitigate issues, would know seeing harsh body spike protein replicated antibodies is, would think extra time may help reduce issues pure speculation. mean heparin? read none 3 women died received heparin? 

Are talking different medication?  Since ia taking medicine considered lit cool? weird times... Got first dose Moderna today! Lets go!! happens take first dose don‚Äôt take second one? work even better J&amp;J vaccine? There's even triple mutant India. 
That's spread faster.

Sometimes messaging sounds like take vaccine, nothing change. fact check take grain salt, explained type blood clots we're talking different happened vaccine, contraceptives risk of. (Though totally agree j&amp;j risk low feels bit silly) arm bit sore 2nd, especially 24 hour mark. 48 hours, there's pain touch it. must gotten really moldy.. Yeah, understand. mentioned regarding hesitant, there‚Äôs simply nothing anyone do. people unfortunately seek confirming information reinforces hesitancy.

I took vaccine knowing risk COVID far greater. It‚Äôs calculation every individual make themselves, unfortunately unable cross boundary. Perhaps circumstances influence decision later point time ( close call friend family member, etc). Anyways work anymore.

That made laugh. I‚Äôm getting really knocked ass today. Got second Pfizer dose 25 hours ago felt like I‚Äôve got flu bad (cold, whole body aches, mental fog, headaches etc etc)

Had symptoms first shot. 

Will worth end today rough. clear calendar morning cause originally planned work understand women impacted demographic turning down. increase confidence FDA process two vaccines. handful (15 date 6 initially) adverse reactions paused rollout *immediately* thoroughly transparently investigate. 

It‚Äôs also reasonable wasn‚Äôt caught trials given rare is. There‚Äôs 7 one million chance women aged 18-49 get clot within 2 weeks vaccine. Round 10 make math easy. 1/100,000. people think reasonable trial size? insist every trial catch every possible outcome, we‚Äôd never new treatments, vaccines, medications approved. 

And make worse, people dismiss covid 2% chance death small. &lt;.001% chance blood clot high. Sure . someone pulled every hair body- one time. Ok people think ramp 3 millions vaccin day 2 weeks Office know much industrialization. honest trump Biden charge anyway, Experimenting natives again? source that? Genuinely curious. 60s got covid hospital conditions. way could ha

It incorrect say US Covid death toll undercount. definitely undercounted much India, nonetheless lesser actual Covid deaths. easily ascertained comparing excess deaths YOY. This. many people unwilling get AZ vaccine, new strains high reproduction number, herd immunity dream? problem little thing called freedom religion. pros cons, exists going go away. someone comes says going ordered something goes expressly religion stands for, bet I'm gonna throw hissy fit. I'm never going go Muslim say ""Hey! eat pork on!"" yes, people people crazy take religion original context. overall, religious freedom better freedom since majority humanity religious. defects legit concern, excluding women childbearing age trials basically treats women like incubators. 

This decision reversed 30 years ago, point fairly irrelevant forgetting fact reliable birth control reliable home pregnancy tests relatively modern inventions. decision exclude women treating women like incubators, acknowledging real risk unknown pregnancy. also cultural impact exact argument abortion. Hope you‚Äôre pro-life, hypocrite. easy choose? got appointment (in Mass), info gonna get day of. pause, pretty much guaranteed Pfizer Moderna, get choice. try look could shop around though, I'm genuinely curious.

Thats messed believe ourworlddata includes shots, UK updated since 21st. it‚Äôs protected class, free terminate someone it. Shirt color, owning pets, last character license plate etc.

Employees knows going in. That‚Äôs called employment.

Don‚Äôt like it: take jobs employment contract. Assuming enough leverage demand it. 85% seems performs b117 accounts vast majority cases uk. ""Obligation"" funny word use. 

I would argue *absolutely* obligation find way utilize 40 million+ doses something every country world currently needs ensure millions people die, something ordered, paid for, asking nothing except let companies fill orders. Instead telling AstraZeneca ""No, actually *want* vaccine, also allowed sell anyone else!""

But simply saying ""We legally required this!"" yeah, sure, congrats that? I'm sure anyone actually arguing otherwise. 

We're arguing longer let vaccines using intention approving using sit warehouse thousands people die worldwide, bigger assholes become. got first shot pfizer today. Arms bit sore shot area. good far. means third sooner. Delayed second dose protects people maintains protection longer Yea BIL surgeon complete dumb shit. Believes 9-11 inside job, Barbra Bush terrorist, flat earth, Bill Gates nano bots. Stupidity isn‚Äôt exclusive medicine. would argue self appointed intellectual superiority makes confident see really don‚Äôt know everything. even read post responding to? vaccines tested equally women men long recommended dosage uno, get lot takers people want one done shot. don‚Äôt find strange all. Half nurses (while good caring us child born) honestly would consider sharpest knives drawer came critical thinking. One literally dropping hints shouldn‚Äôt ever vaccinate kids homeopathic everything way go.  Another turned normal conversation conspiracy theory conversation within minutes. 

I remember seeing breakdown healthcare workers uptake. certain level education % way higher support staff.  Healthcare workers mean support staff many levels. 


Additionally lot people situation Covid quite recently. could see causing people hesitant getting vaccine time especially offered earlier everyone else. Exactly, believe commenter making point you. India literally giving vaccines away countries one point fairly early on? happened?  got point, bad happy every single American even dare thinks sharing vaccines nevermind reasons. right thing wrong reasons (or case merely arguable even) still right thing. Bill Maher said people finding climate science convincing years before: fucking stupid I'll take it. Meanwhile Covid-19 evolving - mentioning third booster shot many us even gotten first yet - think ever rid it. 


I tired masks hand sanitizer :(. q4?!? Yikes. so, border truly won‚Äôt reopen 2023.   mentioned lymph nodes got really swollen felt little weather 2 weeks Pfizer vaccine. know related vaccine seasonal allergies. Good luck! already moving back normal, around country every level government policies relaxing people adjusting behavior see fit. facts happening fast enough personally, lots people disagree pace, evidence conspiracy. variants matter much (the UK variant immunoevasive). main difference 95% calculated symptomatic COVID, study included asymptomatic too. live. Everyone J&amp;J appointments rescheduled Pfizer Moderna instead huge loss.  cycle finished four days second Moderna shot. came back BIG time three days shot pretty weird. minor inconvenience, doubt. unexpected, ha! Yeah, I‚Äôve learned lot nuance rashes last days. It‚Äôs annoying much look alike, yeah, mine scattered whole body ton differences birth control vaccine. First types clots different, clots caused birth control often always easily treated clots caused J&amp;J vaccine type likely cause high mortality morbidity. Pregnancy comes significantly higher risk blood clots BC does, vaccine, benefits preventing condition outweigh risks. Also lots women use BC reasons nothing preventing pregnancy, fact BC orginally approved contraception treat hormonal disorders. 

As male BC, bit hurdle overcome terms bioethics literally possible health benefit person drug administered to. However, recent male BC study aware stopped due headaches fits rage small percentage participants. concern possibility drug resulting domestic violence. find source male BC approved due headaches I'd love see it.

If interested authoritative source clots caused birth control fair comparison vaccine recommend Mama Doctor Jones's video topic- hope tomorrow, getting second dose :) area is. CVS, Walgreens, etc. tell front even schedule it. Everyone time someone gets infected, there's small chance mutation. 141m people infected, that's lot chances mutate.

Yes, look excess death rate say ""see covid-19 worse spanish flu"", b.s. way look data. Mostly means Covid killed old people would long dead age 1920s.

If anything, data mostly points well we've gotten keeping people alive something like Covid-19 really stands excess death rate.

I get NYTimes needs sell clicks, mostly looking ""people used die time 20's, don't, 3M people dying today looks worse 50M dying 20's"".

The facts multiple vaccines, effective variants, Pfizer Moderna working boosters case variant end evading immunity. March 2020 anymore. 

What need export vaccines India get outbreak control. question long-term damage &amp; vaccinations.

We know (unvaccinated) asymptomatic people long-term heart lung damage. 

Vaccines reduce symptoms (and risk). vaccinated person gets infected reduced symptoms, asymptomatic. Could also end long-term heart lung damage?  Virus (and immune system) causes significant damage lungs durng natural infection. Since investigated lung samples covid patients, PAH likely result damage lungs experience infection. Cell signaling observe says ACE receptor downstream pathways (which investigated further) activated spike protein. isnt evidence indicates damages cells, changes irreversible way.  can't taste :P  Yeah honestly can‚Äôt remember may mistaken. Opposite me, since stopped eating out. Also, found time exercise. motivation ending hospital fears blood clot leg DVT. Maybe watch videos want shock action. issue though we're still unsure percentage would clear cut infection rate begins decrease. 

So said 75% ended 80%, cases would rise everything would close more; causing people distrust system even seeing ploy get unwilling participants vaccinated. 

At least that's way see totally understand Fauci would hesitant make clear cut percentage fact herd immunity. never said government anything. think assumed that. Leaving people alone never works. US best example that.

The thing going get tested risky well (india) donot want panic go risk. approach road block, German soldier asks papers.

 vibe going here. COVID-15. Going Twitter thread posted, Indian government got arrogant started believing India somehow intrinsically resistant pandemic. attitude spread people (partly Indian media largely PR arm government). Huge crowds gathered massive political religious events.

In months leading meteoric rise cases, sense pandemic India. India exported many vaccines, possibly believing needed. government promoted traditional medicine ""cure"" COVID. Let's damn new administration faint praise. took epidemic seriously day one. Agreed. quite patriotic...but demand slowing. Send doses! original studies one big protocol violation.

That efficacy thing mentioned _huge_ issue. Dose escalation trials Phase I, Phase III. said, can‚Äôt average efficacy rate it‚Äôs one other.

The first half dose (the 90% effective one, get half dose first second dose month later) tested patients age 55. (Why? fact discovered starting half dose first due mistake. two full doses month apart 62% efficacy.) 

Later, also revealed timing two doses initial half dose patients (already small number) much 3 months apart (instead 1). 

Some issues may uncovered ways vaccine could effective (why longer time shots last study) again, things ‚Äúdiscover‚Äù Phase III. 

And things too. 12% patients 55 years age (compared Pfizer‚Äôs 43% age 55 Moderna‚Äôs 25% age 65). AZ study less minorities enrolled included obese participants (and don‚Äôt mean morbidly obese patients‚ÄîI mean highest BMI participant 29.1). small number older patients complete lack obese patients major issues vaccines always work effectively populations.

For real tho, food comfort ppl. worry asymptomatic organ damage appears mostly overblown - [here's news piece recent large-scale (it gives citation look up, I'm mobile find later trouble finding it). Especially heart damage largely using sensitive instruments find variability pretty common even covid. headlines saw 30% damage? damage something show flu even common cold, usually lead anything. worrisome beginning that's followed confirmed leads nothing, like study linked. 

I'm even sure there's documented cases asymptomatic covid followed heart lung symptoms (there definitely examples findings, i.e. irregularities scans, I'm sure they've led problems). could wrong, certainly common thing.

But thing, vaccine probably make rare ultra-rare. would discourage make difficult illegals get vaccinated. millions living working United States. want turn political debate, huge risk prevent large pockets population living US getting vaccinated. generally live densely packed, work people interacting jobs, pay least sales tax. trying encourage get vaccinated much possible. ya lol lost weight due alot stress man... flu rarely contagious carrier symptomatic.

This biggest difference. lot people thread seem naive vaccines developed monitored. capsule BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine (a German startup partnered US company) Canadian company.

AZ others tests everyone trials weekly would pick aysmptomatic. Also rates low Moderna Pfizer trialled didnt include new infectious Variants spreading rapidly. That‚Äôs Moderna. Shoulda clarified talking J&amp;J. got Pfizer J&amp;J I‚Äôm good now. personal experience Moderna didn‚Äôt look much.  It‚Äôs big deal long run feel like it‚Äôs important let people know it‚Äôs possible experience pretty intense side effects. shocked much body hurt day 2nd Pfizer shot. ended breaking full body rash it‚Äôs going away. Still worth though think main thing needs focused people get vaccinated testing keep track prevalence potential variants. CDC FDA reevaluate and/or approve AstraZeneca?

I know AstraZeneca applied emergency use authorization FDA yet. Probably phase 3 results US yet. Also, phase 3 results better we've seen J&amp;J, requires one dose.

But US holding onto 30 million doses AZ Ohio right now. shelf life 6 months might ever used US.

Meanwhile EU using AZ vaccine facing shortages countries like Brazil India suffering badly.

[Among 20 million people vaccinated AstraZeneca vaccine UK far, 79 cases rare blood clots low platelets reported, well 19 deaths, said UK‚Äôs Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. equates around one case per 250‚Äâ000 people vaccinated‚Äî0.0004%‚Äîand one death J&amp;J I‚Äôm desperate article good news regarding it. Basically anything. found UK , France , Denmark least one case San Francisco. want contain this, maybe restricting foreign flights together answer. strange person No, paused abundance caution. time, didn‚Äôt know adverse responses J&amp;J vaccine common seem be. read this? AF? I'd say Anthony Fauci think would said mask free Memorial Day. Sheesh kidding. Same. mean guess I'm technically part vaccine apathy. decided want bother getting walk-in appointments available locations bit closer. want deal hassle fighting people spot, I've eligible 3 weeks, feel like it. also want deal taking train hour either.

Now there's walk-ins plenty places close me, appointment scheduled 30th rite aid that's block away place.  also going mass vax site, need private room vaccine, otherwise get panic attack.  sole decider would recommended use men, women 50. 

Women 50 low death rates covid anyways, due female young.  Lucky. that. nauseous next day sit up. correct. worries. states moved towards WV model state‚Äôs goddamn hippies caused measles outbreak five years ago.

WA eliminated ‚Äúphilosophical‚Äù exemption kept religious one weirdly vaccination rates schools went up. guess can‚Äôt even bother lie religion it‚Äôs strong philosophy! getting slammed PSAs run networks country. act middle man. send us ads, run them. Funny, see ""anti-vaxx shit"" thread. women concerned want share concerns taken seriously. Sooo... deleting comments going make things better worse? isn‚Äôt seeing media spotlight problems AZ JJ? There's ""oversupply"" states think Infowars news. Thanks, will. sore arm first time. Trump, companies themselves. (all?) condition purchase contracts US couldn‚Äôt ship doses country liability. companies need negotiate terms country. happens US ships vaccine country Africa someone dies? opens vaccine maker lawsuits banned contracts themselves, there‚Äôs contract African country vaccine maker ban lawsuits. mean risk *is* zero older women men (so far). Right, wouldn‚Äôt good policy think could qualify policy. Actually, since mentioned it, slight less hated. :) explains MSM political agendas ~ Protesting safe, Trump rallies Super Spreaders... Gov.

True. case, would question people‚Äôs ability read room. No, warfarin vitamin K antagonist, heparin thrombin antagonist. work different ways, different molecules different risks. don‚Äôt even know believe anymore. Fuck, want shit get back normal. Pretty sure AstraZeneca, J&amp;J watch news much?

We try focus .01% long supports fear mongering. Supreme Court already ruled interning Japanese. government compel whatever deem necessary benefit national security. might like agree it, Yeah that's need, less transparency  Oh, mistake. Thanks correction. UK delaying doses vaccines. I'm due second Pfizer May first shot February. Trials found AZ worked better like UK decided delay vaccines get many people form protection asap. estradiol pills ones cis women's birth control

No, not. Birth control pills generally use ethinylestradiol, recall significantly higher clot risk bioidentical estradiol used HRT. Oral bioidentical estradiol still much higher clot risk parenteral routes, though.  real mistake still Facebook Well duh! addition UK variant, viral load may higher healthcare setting. Yeah, huge portion get completely wrong risk assessments. Kind shows smart enough use decision making framework all. true, 5 6 appointments I've booked 16 17 year olds, none asked consent even ID/Insurance. Simply put, ask literally saying ""they told go get it"" suffice swollen lymph nodes would describe hot eyes 9 days. I've fine since. I'm one friends family deal symptoms, I've heard others online experienced similar. hope bad, probably need patient symptoms. EUA vs full approval nothing legal perspective. Vaccine skeptic protected class like race gender, vaccine skeptics fired vaccine skeptic. I‚Äôm right you! 33F history low platelets information came like two days afterwards. helpless feeling. I‚Äôm also day 13 post shot. Best luck you. I'm going try convince care people. They've known awhile ventilation key. Unfortunately, upgrading ventilation systems expensive telling people wear mask stand 6 feet apart cheap. point simple math equation policy makers: kill 2 save 12.

Uhm. vaccines market. USA enough vaccine everyone. someone decised protect himself, well, them.   based educated guess long enough second shot without taking long study. based experience two dose vaccines giving us decent idea immune response happens. Forcing vaccine authoritarian right. Personal freedom important collective imo. I‚Äôm saying someone plans get vaccine soon Yeah, sister idiot.

People like excuse gaslight us pro-vax women know bodies something normal though. already need vaccines plenty things. different. opinion Reddit dangerous, that's bit paranoid. even mentioned beliefs stand lol. 

I care get vaccinated not. care willing expose people. allowed certain things choose hazard, that's choice. 

But people right exclude lives, want stores pose risk. choice, sometimes choices consequences negatively affect people. get hit hard last year? assumed India would Brazil levels bad living conditions certain parts country, remember seeing headlines like last year. so, can't help wonder changed. Sorry see this. It‚Äôs probably true infected might need vaccine. Reinfections nothing novel. it‚Äôs yet clear antibodies previous infected, unable asymptomatically give virus, Pfizer moderna‚Äôs recent data makes clear deadens asymptomatic transmission point, 15 cases blood clots J&amp;J vaccine. 15 cases women 13 15 women 50. really wonder two women. average age menopause 51/52 women hit menopause 58/59. two women might women 50s hit menopause yet.

Give J&amp;J shot (willing) men. evidence complications men. According doc, behaves treated same. initially triggered severe viral infection. people, goes away time. Mine gone away far. I‚Äôve shots really wish wouldn‚Äôt lie us! Tanzania variant bad! 13.9% post-8 week, confirmed heartbeat pregnancies ended loss vaccine definitely safe pregnant women. don‚Äôt think 13.9% represents.  Germany afford great olive branch India. world needs India fit healthy manafacturing medical capabilities, least humanitarian grounds. 1,4 billion people...am sure spare stuff west help Hmmm... seemed incorrect statement. free here, we've much better success vaccination rates. honestly dont know anyone even cares. care less period happened come early late. even matter much many people? graph distribution numbers anywhere? Here‚Äôs honest question anyone: would make difference give shot smaller volume vaccine smaller people? vaccines work way ‚Äî weight size person doesn‚Äôt relationship react? I‚Äôm guessing no, I‚Äôve wondering this. CA, July 4th pretty conservative timeline mask mandates removed. see mask ""recommendations"" thing fall, true mandate businesses required follow makes sense summer. wife got vaccinated Wednesday. knew going Pfizer said booked appointment. 

When there, asked confirm getting Pfizer. confirmed said pretty much everybody day asked confirmation many said wanted make sure J&amp;J. 

There may problem getting people take J&amp;J great alternatives. That‚Äôs think see stories like this. It‚Äôs absolutely *crazy* people US refusing vaccine others around world literally dying it. apparently don‚Äôt realize great opportunity access. 

I think soon supply outweighs demand US (and think states approaching point?), start exporting. Even turns need 3rd booster, don‚Äôt see can‚Äôt build supply *and* also send plenty abroad. addition responses, also good keep mind current vaccines went full-bore ""high-end best guess"" dosage would provoke robust immune response; want run another trial higher dosage. vaccines gate, they're looking reducing dosages, may also reduce side effects. example, Moderna testing 10mcg 30mcg dosages updated vaccine, rather 100mcg first-gen vaccine. I'd expect Pfizer testing lower dosages well, especially booster seems least highly plausible lower dosages effective. co-worker mine wants J&amp;J vaccine health issues (a lot allergies, think) thinks worse normal reaction second dose Moderna Pfizer. Previously reported onset symptoms 6-13 days post shot. don‚Äôt see updated numbers article. Anyone know? business *didn‚Äôt* suffer. market works awful ways, history shows. I‚Äôm going litigate entirety civil rights legislation reddit thread, say way sucks ends bunch shitty racists running everything.

A vaccine identity, religion. clearly choice vaccinated, choice based sincerely held religious belief. It‚Äôs based false sense person taking risk themselves, true burden falls people. It‚Äôs generally based prioritizing personal inconvenience health others, aka selfish prick. Selfish pricks protected class.

I‚Äôll also point ‚Äúlet wear masks‚Äù folks seem people ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt anything‚Äù folks last year. Honestly don‚Äôt want vaccine that‚Äôs around year so. 10 years study it? Sure I‚Äôll get it. vaccines, nothing people wanting vaccine. 

I‚Äôm concerned covid whatsoever though risk getting new vaccine hasn‚Äôt tested long term? guys trying force everyone doesn‚Äôt make want get vaccine all. fact makes hate y‚Äôall everyone trying force vaccine. One less thing worry about! paused JJ good reason created mass hysteria anti-vaxxers.

Our fine U.S. government work, folks! Yup, got J&amp;J mid February 2021 part research study, although know got real thing placebo 6 weeks later. Saturation level like 60% 70-80... tell you, assume vaccinated. Find new provider. Great read day getting first Pfizer shot! thing indoor social distancing Please. People countries simply angry wrong defeating covid. thought vaccines would necessary horrible Americans. Oh wait ... need vaccines wrong want take another country placed order 2020. Still 70+ 80+ Italy lol government people too. Lmao gotta weed em out, boys Yes.

Depending blood clots occur varying impact/death rate, etc. believe provide source? many ""some""? 3.1 million jabs administered today, average \~2 420 000. supplies expected (almost!) double May, surpassing 4 000 000 seem unlikely exactly month. 

With fifth vaccine expected approved \~late May, early June EMA, along even doses expected June, enough offer everyone first shot end quarter. Please provide references claims. mRNA usage goes back 1990s. trialed properly. right, send poutine pals north Yes, right.
What meant say ban place time.
Indian government could try get raw materials alternative sources meantime.

Only things really really bad, started think raw materials blamed USA it. Yes first received 2nd shot today. feeling happening. Please go wash car. Next year gonna interesting. wonder whether we'll see uptick autoimmune conditions due strong immune response mounted multiple-injection vaccines. they're talking twice year boosters... mh. Perhaps terms death rates. still data long term implications COVID relative flu adults, let alone children (as seem affected).

That mean long term implications however. Long COVID brutal; viral stuff really linger cause issues sometimes even years, COVID added effect blood clots causing damage organ systems know plays time. Maybe quick heal kids- maybe not.

Anyways I'm going ""just flu kids bro"" seems risky rationalization awesome vaccine candidates looking certified kids near future. especially kids 12-15 (since 16-18 get pfizer now)- months likelihood. genuinely understand not. may even approve AZ ever...and certainly \*soon\* everyone complained ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù liar seeing ignored Patriotic duty anyways help slow spread. Thing flu vaccine sheds, may protect ppl passing flu could opposite effect. particular year last decade U.K. major variant flu going around vaccine/mist, plus effectiveness isn‚Äôt amazing varies year year article suggests indoors e safe even full capacity well ventalated. Although COVID-19 vaccines tested equally among men women lab, different dose sizes not. could mean lower doses women may effective protecting COVID-19 cause fewer side effects, Klein Johns Hopkins told Times. 

pasted another article Miami Times. worry much :) look symptoms fine!

And might still save someone else vaccine, remember that! You‚Äòre correct it‚Äôs going hard parse out, think that‚Äôs researchers don‚Äôt understand questions ask get information. don‚Äôt believe think it‚Äôs important, makes mad. failure medical research. US, women weren‚Äôt even permitted clinical trials medications 1990s.  
I thought crazy wondered vaccine could impact cycle. googled saw thousands women talking it. issue listed side effect expected didn‚Äôt worry. Women shouldn‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre crazy experiencing clearly least somewhat common side effects medical treatment. wonder questions menstruation even asked trials. It‚Äôs problem women‚Äôs reactions medicine seem important they‚Äôre pregnant breastfeeding.  
The vaccines likely very, safe probably reasonable explanation haven‚Äôt found yet, scientists dripped ball looking closer trials. phrase correctly. One three Australia yesterday 80. skimmed article didn‚Äôt see that. mention 50s Germany got clots 60% vaccinated. 70% high standard. WV never get there... Like sort terrible things? denialism normalcy bias main coping mechanisms people have, made pandemic worse be, since makes people find reasons take seriously needs be. post highlights that, gets downvoted ""dooming"". responding ""period problem,"" talking thread probably show trials, bc women hormonal birth control shown related article. also want anyone think saying shots unsafe.

I know two different types clots. Kind random aside, women closely sharing household tend periods sync longer live together. surprised disruption one roommate's cycle impacted other. 

*disclaimer* idea happens, does.  Michigan currently experiencing sharpest decline country. Try reading studies good vaccines are. I‚Äôm making recommendations lightly know got couple replies, can‚Äôt repeated enough: **Yes. three US-authorized vaccines target spike protein.** mRNA ones use modified viral RNA ‚Äúteach‚Äù body recognize target spike protein. J&amp;J shot uses slightly different approach, (essentially) takes part virus responsible spike protein wraps hollowed human adenovirus body already recognize. Think way: they‚Äôre learning exact course material, different teaching methods. 

Scientists *very, very* cautious using words like ‚Äúproof,‚Äù leads lot confusion comparing lot mixed answers whether prevents infection, transmission, etc., intents purposes, there‚Äôs currently reason think immunity J&amp;J shot would function differently long term. published protection percentage lower, that‚Äôs partially function fact went ~~tougher~~ varied trials. tested later pandemic variants, extensively places around world variants common. 

The recent reports saw indicated second dose J&amp;J shot given ‚Äî mRNA vaccines tested way J&amp;J one ‚Äî protection would virtually identical (J&amp;J allegedly working second dose would used such). important takeaway though **all three vaccines essentially 100% effective preventing hospitalization death** based know viral load asymptomatic cases, also offer degree (likely high amount) protection transmitting virus. Why'd delete original downvoted response? Bulletin: Canada Europe (flair). came untied drifted N America. Hasn‚Äôt WV historically one better states comes vaccination? It‚Äôs likely new variant, N.10, discovered recently rather P.1. say? However, seems weird since discovery little mention sole focus P.1. Haha relate. health anxiety real bad. convinced going die allergic reaction vaccine times (despite never bad reaction vaccine, anything else, ever). Also, like convinced times gonna get bad symptoms. bright side is, happy outcomes much better anticipating! I'm Australia, so.... either way. also seen many placed back hospital due vaccine let‚Äôs act like it‚Äôs miracle drug.

‚Äòmany‚Äô weasel word. many? many died? compared COVID deaths let‚Äôs act like it‚Äôs miracle drug.

Israel less stopped COVID vaccination, UKs numbers amazing. I‚Äôm pretty sure miracle drug.  Yeah, and? remove CDC wrong, removed were. No, comes deadly virus continue learn new information about, I'll follow experts reddits ""general vibe."" fear actual number might double

I'd go least octuple tell Catch-22 longer school curriculum. Hipaa prevents involuntary disclosure, voluntary. could ask staff permission disclose. exactly factual info? Bloomberg says administered 222 million doses used 77.7% supply. translates 286M doses total means 60 million doses available... don‚Äôt know determined time period. would assume wanted wait long enough maximize chances getting good results. Moderna may simply picked cautious route 28 days.

The difference two merely set trials. may difference optimal times doses health experts going go proven. today, European Union received total 150 million doses national governments administered around 123 According President von der Leyen, EU-based plants exported 155 million vaccine doses 87 countries since December.

So, doses exported EU distributed EU members. guess union bit altruistic intended... number exported doses includes UK's 20 million Biontech/Pfizer doses administered far. Astra Zeneca doses imported outside EU, understand, company scrambled supplement production troubled EU manufacturing plants.

For record, I'm criticizing political decisions. think good thing export ban, I'm hoping US lift theirs. I'm sure will, since seems enough vaccine available already. talks quality healthcare workers vaccines. Miami article:

 Although COVID-19 vaccines tested equally among men women lab, different dose sizes not. could mean lower doses women may effective protecting COVID-19 cause fewer side effects, Klein Johns Hopkins told Times. much colleges hope this, I'm pretty sure poster correct. can't enforce something full FDA approval. seems like scare tactic point. I'm unsure it. one hand right. Many things available. other, population much younger. thing closed. sure why. going get paid then? fairness guy‚Äôs point, vaccine definitely reduce transmission however probably reduce 0, especially since vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective. fear would moreso India‚Äôs variant fact way dangerous ones rest world would take one person get sick bring back. Hence ‚Äúbeing vaccinated‚Äù shouldn‚Äôt golden ticket travel somewhere like India right now. Negative tests mean nothing. need one get international flight Australia yet we're finding constant covid cases hotel quarantine! There‚Äôs cottage industry doctors willing write vaccine waivers. takes somebody family immune disorder like eczema, allergies, asthma. pay money 5 min consultation go. Yeah remember last May end month weighing lost 10 pounds happy cause needed/wanted lose weight anyways. almost year later I'm back weight 20 pounds heavier that. Sucks cause losing slow process I'm patient lol I'm trying could definitely better diet. came fast food almost daily definitely struggle. Fully believe fast food addictive one Thank you! mean, would great well. AstraZeneca hasn‚Äôt even applied emergency use states yet, FDA takes several weeks approve. Best case scenario, talking vaccines approved states June. 

I‚Äôm saying ship approved vaccines yet, clear Astra won‚Äôt get approved well vaccines widely available. Many people way pro-Covid pro-human.  Act like ass want private buds follow protocols public. 

And actually reckless ass private compliant protocols workplace it‚Äôs one venue people can‚Äôt choose avoid.  pandemic revealed larger % population pieces shit previously knew.  US far behind India. us short weeks. state governors reopening. uncontrollable variants everything opening up, US situation. getting 5M per day? Last checked, Moderna Pfizer together delivering 2.5M doses day (this last week) maybe add J&amp;J 3.5M nowhere near close 5M... link looks like says 40% said ""definitely"" get vaccine, 23% said ""probably"" get it. closer 63% get it, likely vaccines get full FDA approval workplaces make mandatory. I'm pretty sure public acceptance trending upwards lately well. already almost 42% population least one dose (about 53% eligible population), definitely 40% acceptance rate.

And cases starting go US, [the 7-day rolling average new cases going week population Florida 21 million spread 66,750 square miles. estimated India's Kumbh festival drew many 10 million people one location two weeks. one socially distanced one wore masks.

This inevitable. Dude, reason EU short vaccines (or was) AZ deliver contracts. ordered around compared population US. hey, know barely use Moderna right now? can't ship orders contracted US! Fun ""saving"" working? Election rallies... Mass gatherings religious events... see coming? Used hippy tourist trail back 60s, hopefully day again, Syria data graph Eric Topol‚Äôs Tweet current today. states mentioned trending downward.  Interesting, good article! 

However, stands today, India China focal point. honestly don‚Äôt give shit happens 2100 lol EU, comparison, spent months dickering quid per dose horrible predicament.

Because AZ deliver contracts, otherwise would place UK US. France lockdown? Cool. looks number people dying India, that's scary.

/s course told someone. wow. Rebook closer. Understandable wanting drive far dose, especially would traveling alone. Quite opposite :P lost 10 LB since March 2020 It'll much better last year save hot spots there. That's asinine assumption   dumb. 2 anti vac friends want lovingly tell somethings don‚Äôt know how. see whatever personal attack ‚Äúpro big pharma‚Äù certainly not. Thank you.   Nope, we're keyworkers who've community outreach learning disabled people throughout pandemic. [Very well run organisation making heavy use PPE, hand sanitising, regular cleaning maintaining distinct bubbles people visit. surprising I'll admit organisation large, going travelling various towns cities throughout crisis including lockdowns managed avoid contact coronavirus. couple clients families got it, none staff.

With regard post linked, part organisation treats employees well, keep high retention rates (we never use agency staff), staff take extreme care look clients. We've consciously avoided unnecessary risks either work private lives, avoiding going except shopping exercise even luls lockdowns. visit pub even since crisis started, respect concerns family members clients trusted everything keep loved ones safe. colleagues say same. best advice time. I‚Äôm trying get house little bit everyday doesn‚Äôt necessarily around bunch people acclimate normal again. Still wearing mask applicable fully vaccinated, it‚Äôs adjustment. Oh damn, bad. totally misread title thought said, within U.S. Thanks clearing up. Well, yes. 100 years ago would probably way deadly. oxygen, vax, less sanitation, lockdowns... absolutely true pandemic dent numbers, numbers hygiene knowledge. 


....which contradicting point, I'm mildy pedantic today, sorry.  ol' reddit diatribe. Likely will. Glad u got it.   PR cover J&amp;J. already pretty iron-clad immunity shield US side effects one.

This get front vaccine skepticism. argue right call not, learned 500 new clotting cases pause we'd singing different tune. agree pause, exact reason US bought 4 vaccine programs simultaneously. hope restrictions (including indoor ones) end sometime year

I think later year. We'll soon get point anyone get vaccine appointment needed ramp pressure loosen restrictions. sick...stay home! welcome wear mask much want. I'm healthcare worker really think masks policy full time healthcare settings.

1.) like coughed sick patients

2.) like able smell people's stinky breath

3.) like able secretly chat colleagues without anyone able read lips 

4.) like uttering profanities breath encounter idiotic patients. 

That said, intend wear mask anywhere required. going part casual attire vaccines prevalent pandemic loses steam.   you‚Äôre sick agree, really don‚Äôt want see mask mandates 5 months year regards first point, doesn‚Äôt paper report Nf-Kb, MAPK AP-1 activation along IL-6 production? signalling cascade components obviously involved wide range cellular functions, doesn‚Äôt sound like inflammatory response?

Not particularly surprising ask me. Yup, it‚Äôs affected nearly everyone one way another. moms cousins husband died covid past week Ecuador....so many dead dying even vaccine already available How's working flu far? Well maybe india foot bill then. talking US going even debt save others India go debt instead, That's fantastic they're testing asymptomatics. feel serious side effects dose 2? so, worse 1st dose? Technically, 61% saw undesired changes, include loss. intending stay around 130lbs, difficult slip towards 125lbs. I'm trying eat more, appetite always there. think part due stress whole thing. mainly stating shots readily available everyday state. There‚Äôs large group that‚Äôs dragging feet large group doesn‚Äôt want it. We‚Äôre agreement then. *pushes glasses* well *technically* hanging supposed instantly kill breaking neck; death strangulation usually happens mess up. 30 cruise trip India sounds ideal. Same. arm sore hours, spot gave shot, it. Perfectly fine next day. We're stopping people would refuse wear masks distancing unvaccinated already it.

I know part ""it's punishing vaccinated people follow rules point"" hard understand risk carrying/spreading small well.

Effectively, virus dies without spreading much population basically. Well I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm super excited get back gym, going lie, thought indoors strangers breathing heavily little mask enforcement scares me. 

I wasn‚Äôt expecting feel way getting vaccinated. need drill irrationality head üò¨ Simply untrue. US 30% full vaccination rate 18+.  That's catch22 government runs people's religious beliefs. Anyway since ganga purifies problem, rather reverse. Ganges destroys Coronavirus Political how? seems moving festival means worsening current situation cannot favourable party??? bail everyone pandemic

You're now. related vaccines: BionTech German, Moderna partnered Lonza production Swiss, considering y'all blocking important exports EU that's mostly bailing people considering they're allowing exports. vaccine? aren‚Äôt countries sending excess vaccine India? ever going end? born '86 I, too, appaled. certainly together. Yep. vaccines near 100 percent effective hospitalization death. many people think get jabbed suddenly immune.  really need hammer point it‚Äô takes time it‚Äôs like aspirin diarrhea pill desired results within hours satire right? spread covid infected

Has actually proven?

And no, ""BuT CoMMoN sEnSE!"" proof. don‚Äôt ‚Äúpoint‚Äù. 

Lipids advertised ‚Äúcritical‚Äù development vaccine lol. 

Bye.  feel bad India. Cumulative numbers always increase. point tapering quite rapidly. agree big concern. immediate next concern turns Bangladesh Yes worked government projects time thry always included clause thry intellectual rights everything made since paid made.

I idea included contract begin unless either private companies funded think trump charge wanted invest pharmaceutical company would get rich corruption.  general rule 1st dose 14 days.  limited protection first 2 weeks  studies Said 80 percent protection 14 day period plan to. US experiencing surplus vaccines places. time export least little. National security.

Next week mRNA vaccines similar side effect potential J&amp;J vaccines get paused. AZ point may authorized use least subset population.

I think US weeks away starting export appreciable quantities. A) don‚Äôt. use bullshit excuses destabilise foreign governments.

B) Don‚Äôt really give shit that. doesn‚Äôt anything country.

C) asking ‚Äúhelp‚Äù US. asking ‚Äúprecious‚Äù. asking return favour. 

D) seems like incapable even that.  weeks back boarded flight , supposed covid -ve report done within 72 hours flight. airport three places asked covid report. ask check report +ve -ve tho. even check saying truth. said, ""yeah report"" lazy even verify heck even check result actually negative. 

PS- India.  source provided said so... I'm sure even getting at. also understand mad feel protective America's contribution vaccine development personally anything simply born there.

I feel strongly anyway. accomplishment, I'm quite certain work done university Pennsylvania accomplishment.

You asked weird question vaccine development, provided answer.

That still change address original point. said incorrect.

Currently, advice vaccinated freely hang vaccinated people. Masking still encouraged public spaces don‚Äôt know isn‚Äôt vaccinated. Large gatherings same, it‚Äôs mostly still ways go terms numbers. don‚Äôt want large event ton unvaccinated people congregate spread it.

Basically, - vaccination way way there, we‚Äôre yet.

Your whole point ‚Äúthem‚Äù simple conspiratorial nonsense. Absolutely share excess vaccines. Biden administration make sure it. also get house order first. pandemic was, still is, very, bad United States. better beginning, vulnerable comparison enough population vaccinated. friend coworker (saying ‚Äújust cold‚Äù) KEPT COMING TESTED POSITIVE TOO. Friend working home office fortunately reported management said sick guy told ‚Äúfelt fine‚Äù. Sure enough, others got sick.

Sick guy absolutely could worked home, COVID 19 denier. Well, posting all? sure parent make rules, seems like mind already made up. people simultaneously calling China‚Äôs COVID response excessive saying ‚ÄúChina warn us seriousness virus‚Äù. 11 people one place got it, place that‚Äôs mostly vaccinated, it‚Äôs evidence vaccinated people spreading covid. stop majority country stopping everything too? want ride one final ride stop significant spread? Everyone would love believe scientists completely figured covid spreads, ""6 feet"" rule, masks, restrictions based science studies.

But they're not. made hurry. see one hand changed 6 feet 3 feet accommodate schools, article says 6 feet 60 feet risk.

Meanwhile everywhere go, people tape stickers floor 6 feet apart people stand like obedient lemmings. never based real science data. sure. think frictionless/no appointment shots get us another 10 maybe even 15% people happen? could swear St. Albans last week. drink Ye Olde Fighting ~~Fingering~~ Cocks. Needless say, little disappointed realized misread sign. idk downvoted, happening india totally left field. know everyone theories severity quickness totally unreal me.  That‚Äôs pretty general. case every municipality, state, province, city country? hardly travel India Pakistan. share one militarized borders world. Proximity India worry. certainly learn India's mistakes. Yep got 2nd dose Pfizer Thursday never felt thing. seems random. Understandably. hard take serious initial handling pandemic.  Labs currently testing turtles. Yeah wonder companies charging per shot (and raising costs even higher future) desperately studies, trying justify giving everyone shots lol.  2 1 million also struck lightning according CDC numbers. [Here's chilling want infected parents partially vaccinated. even leaving house anymore. US slowly changing, used booked appointment, places tell one call.

In countries obviously option. Think anytime redditor suggests people still worried don‚Äôt *want* pandemic over.  Haven‚Äôt seen you‚Äôre describing, I‚Äôd say worry less 6ft vs 10ft whatever air flow, ventilation, minimizing groups table (bathrooms, food/drink/?) I've seen multiple email reminders break room protocol, surprise me. Username checks out? people capable looking data making decision based instead emotion hysteria. also keep mind flu statistically dangerous children 10. fear mkgnering Haha liked metaphor , made sense me. got Pfizer experienced first slight sore arm. second dose got small headache chills lasted like 2 hours. didn‚Äôt take Tylenol anything . wonder catch COVID-19, would even affect drastic degree? issue said? WTF bunch antivaxxers get thread something? Tons hospitals actually nicotine tests fire/not hire people smoke  surprise? time vaccinate world kids exposed. Cue Covid turning coronavirus common cold strain number five. Okay IUD (hormonal) since Dec 2019. gave good college try 2020 (I skipped first month, excitedly, since I‚Äôve 10-12 day periods like clockwork monthly). 

I‚Äôve schedule IUD removed I‚Äôm sick long ass periods weight gain (my life didn‚Äôt change pandemic, already worked home). 

Anyway, got second shot already week late (which weird itself). Side effects kicked ass today. also took pregnancy test cuz haven‚Äôt late year. pregnant.

I feeling first shot threw though. Abysmal disaster compared neighbors. per Worldometers they‚Äôre 1372 deaths per million, compared 426 (Denmark), 163 (Finland), 135 (Norway). that‚Äôs given Denmark connection mainland Europe best comparison Norway Finland, magnifies extraordinary stubbornness stupidity. first shot brought issues. second brought myself, wife, mildly difficult day 24 hours after. rough, worse nasty cold. within 36 hours felt mostly normal, little fatigued.

48 hours back normal every way.

Certainly worth mild discomfort. We're ten days away total comfort, though continue mask case new information counters current assumptions.

It feels good. Really, really good. Personally hoping would let telepathically communicate Bill Gates let become part Borg collective could go around saying ""resistance futile"" üññ Yeah, nobody forcing get it. don‚Äôt tell you, go appointment leave it‚Äôs wrong one. vaccines don‚Äôt blood there‚Äôs connection there.

FTM I'll glad give body hair, shave look like Chewbacca skirt. FDA endorse first doses first challenge free vaccines short term vaccinate countries surging cases. Yes. Major factors include transportation. Many people reliable transportation. People home bound also tough time finding vaccines. CVS send vaccinator home. Different endpoints Supreme Court India called ""national emergency"". beyond emergency. ""complete collapse goddamn system"", one India's leading virologists says. hotspots like Delhi Mumbai, life, itself, privilege.

I genuinely know respond that. Cases still exponentially growing too, catastrophe going get worse next weeks. No, still apparently mask deal restrictions, ridiculous unfair. I'm glad letting people take it, worry people clotting disorders know it. much want clotting disorder, I'm glad know J&amp;J vaccine cause clots. almost got J&amp;J vaccine, switched Moderna one heard clot issues.

Unless talking people throwing disposable masks ground. Again, agree disgusting. one likes looking trash. that's environmental problem, that's aesthetic one. mild aches mild headache first. enough take work, enough annoying day. GQP? NYC (and presumably places similar programs) also using J&amp;J door-to-door vaccinations homebound seniors vulnerable people. It‚Äôll good resume. I‚Äôm sure never fence getting vaccinated. people refuse vaccine don‚Äôt think like you. see government told it‚Äôs safe, backtracked months later. fostering relations countries, aka vaccine diplomacy, experiencing massive covid wave. Maybe should‚Äôve prioritized  country making vaccines countries one largest vaccine producers even competent enough ensure populace well vaccinated following proper COVID safety protocols (ex: useless rallies, enforcing lockdown, etc.) Yes.

Seriously drives fucking insane. Canada, confirm. need doses pronto. tad picky say, beggars can‚Äôt choosers. WA always let people out. coming back that's problem. sound right. Based said health professional can't give info vaccines can't administer them. ""Joe got vaccine last week Sally refuses."" giving advice counseling patient.

I'm sure law exist prevent dentist giving medical advice lung cancer GI doc telling rash ass that. got J J vaccine 11th, think you‚Äôre clear tomorrow. reported adverse reactions happened within 6-13 days receiving it. Ahh. see. Typical GQP traitor. could written post. got 2nd Pfizer dose 25 hours 15 minutes ago. Felt fine day. rough night first dose woke feeling great. Last night couldn‚Äôt sleep, 100.5 fever. went 98 slowly creeping back get near day end.

Muscle aches, nausea, appetite, slight fever, joint pain. Arm fine. 

Hoping back tomorrow. neighbor said took four days get back normal. 

I‚Äôve logging vsafe since day first shot.

Would 120% again. Thrilled protected. mRNA game changer. I'm curious, anyone located United States actively trying get vaccine appointment able to? honestly seems like point want one able get one problem (meaning opening damn soon, point post). I'm fully vaccinated checked curiosity CVS literally appointments open day next week (you could get one tomorrow morning wanted). I'm Vegas vaccine administration pretty good easy get appointment I'm guessing must apply many (most?) cities. idk maybe I'm wrong.  3 billion people two countries alone, 4.5 rest world combined. day week, that‚Äôs population crisis, pandemic reality, it‚Äôs global crisis. There‚Äôs thing socially distancing India, Chinese people live [*forty square foot* 

The argument Chinese population historical recent non-start, number maintained problematic. population dense countries, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs problem. Yeah r/stopdrinking lit since last April. know I'm drinking boat sure. Cutting back easy thought would be... gained 100 pounds, ugh. Lots Americans afraid surprise costs. It‚Äôs extremely common told medical visit procedure covered insurance find fact owe thousands dollars. Among many variables, wouldn‚Äôt surprised fear costs part reason people delaying. 

It‚Äôs supposed free regardless insurance stories people getting $2,000 bills COVID tests throughout pandemic. many people take time work unpaid make mass vaccination site, plus risk unpaid time recover second shot. Got Moderna. Advice regards report health concerns what?   went national zoo back August September 2020, online (free) tickets reserve would let anyone one. already system place it. ‚ÄúCovid 19‚Äù accumulating doses faster administering them, serves purpose toward vaccinating citizens. assumption ""Accumulating doses vaccinate citizens"" false.

Oh that‚Äôs right $440m vs $4b actually took vaccines - program designed help poor countries. Yet US bad guy. Cmon man. far know, US issued advisories outright bans. However, may well changed. lost 30 pounds.

Especially kids.

I hope restrictions (including indoor ones) end sometime year. somehow didn't.

As grocery, us ordering amazon, everything that‚Äôs ordered given guards downstairs leave outside homes, sanitise everything well possible.

We'll certainly donating excess doses long run. 

If receiving deliveries faster could inject them, what's happening States right now, yes I'd certainly advocate us donating excess supply. Yeah, reading articles [like (where journalist essentially live tweeted death refused medical care) helps put perspective me. insane, tragic, really difficult even comprehend relying Americans hold end bargain..

And Canada done contribute research, development, manufacturing, distribution vaccines? Canada's contribution America bad guy? Hmm... need food live home options exercise. wonder why? Ohhhhhh. Thank you. 70% americans overweight 42% obese. headline misleading underachieving. Unless want ultra super conservative, like multiple risk factors, wouldn‚Äôt worry it. number cases people caught covid twice extremely small.

* Pfizer EUA expanded age 12, eligible population increased approximately 6,020,000.

Back January/February 2020 family got worst cough we‚Äôd ever had, far. Sick dogs, almost went ER. Maybe total coincidence, idk, hope gets investigated epidemiological level point.

Behavior also outstanding, tho. Everyone wearing masks distancing early pandemic. kind generational effect seen infants pandemic two decades' time. honeymoon 26th May, probably happening transit UAE anyway red list.

Gonna cost ¬£3k+ rebook well holiday costs shot roof.  We'll done June/July, maybe get vaccine uptake rate start boasting solving problem exist, huh? ban flights, actual quarantine requirement thats enforced tracked. Long term effects going far reaching. Slowly, putting worst pandemic behind us.  authors suggest making vaccines use one spike subunits RBD safer. Make will. 

But right. Depending pandemic scenarios sooner later exposed virus ""nasty"" spike vaccines largely protect worst.  real problem, possible going suffer effects sooner later.

Do know people recovered SARS1 experience hypothetical problem? Imagine people spread to... stupid shaming. everyone access vaccine harming others. Seriously though like lie brary Im expert, memory serves right, Tehreek E Labaik (hope im pronouncing right) protests happening many main cities pakistan, quite alot people.

$940M, States per capita. 

And I'm asking States anything ask Canada do. Share doses country can't use. Right position expectations remain unchanged. There's double standard here. even need name specific countries. Every country around world share doses cannot use. Thank you! National governments taking care citizens interests first course reasonable understandable, applying standard universally, American government moral right whatsoever criticize China stockpiling PPE beginning pandemic, certainly conceivable grounds complain China Russia engaging ""vaccine diplomacy"".

Speaking which, one American government's main strategic goals right unite allies partners growing Chinese influence. India huge part that. India, many problems, democracy. Indian politicians voters going remember helped greatest crisis recent memory.

Your point current Indian government largely blame current issues definitely valid. Covid still 'super deadly'. India dense uptick cases huge. Ignorance bliss known weeks now, possibly longer that's first time saw CDC head acknowledge it. everything I've seen Fauci, Fauci he's interviewed one, dancing around issue whenever brought interviews. I'd imagine concern acknowledges there's medical evidence justifying vaccinated people forced wear masks, people vaccinated might say they're vaccinated wear mask.

I've said million times subreddit absolutely despise reasoning lot reasons. 

1: diminishes already tarnished trust public health officials. know there's medically sound reason vaccinated people wear masks tell anyway, lying. care ""white lie"" whatever, what's line always hear medical experts? They're scientists politicians? They're impartial? see consistent standard rather something pick choose based expedience.

2: disincentives vaccinations. extreme majority people serious risk vaccinated. remainder people realistically die virus. need every tool book motivate fear work. Telling need still mask distance without evidence support creates attitude bother.

3: punishing majority actions drastic minority. Even ignoring we're couple weeks people entire country vaccinated, meaning *most people* medical justification wear mask weeks point regimen completed, people generally honest. cannot base entire world view around actions worst define many. case many laws protect innocent persecution suspicion criminal behavior. assumption people good generally defines country's Justice philosophy, think okay ignore here.

I'm completely opposed lying effective vaccination every single possible angle, even funny frustrated makes me. cannot stand condescending question dodges unapologetic ""Greater good"" lying we've seen again. used say I'll trust experts every time lately I've become convinced need earn trust ever want back, I'm becoming convinced see honesty gift. think reading much it. said 6 months ago point Trump years. imply administrations changed right then. honestly though wasn‚Äôt years civil unrest area, afghanistan could one best ski areas world, im joking say either. said workface...heh problem is, people cant identify quantify risk is. able see trade offs given mitigation strategies. essentially entire mindset Canada right now. Easier blame dang Americans look mirror got here. AZ sold cost. Cost logically permit much expansion, considering margin set aside expansion. Israel UAE spent fortune got earliest supply, consequence gave Pfizer, Moderna liquidity expand. 

The EU went wrong. treated Moderna,.AZ.and Pfizer like money grubbing international pharmas. used believe pandemic. pandemic, important outcome returning life normal, countless billions lost lockdowns vastly important relative pittance 10-30 billion euro invested. EU tried take ""hard pharma"" philosophy thought would prevent corporate abuse excess profits. Excess profits needed big pharma bet vaccines might even approved FDA European medical agencies various EU countries. What's wrong people standing basic rights? really point people beg governments take rights away cough? mean, okay, virus fairly serious threat certain groups people god damn bubonic plague would wonderful people would stop acting like is. Sure, wear mask, stay away crowds wash hands bit often. simply draw line ignore everything else. things since whole thing started last year traveled quite bit, even worked cruise ship 3 months, Germany entered neverending lockdown. I've yet catch virus 3 simple tricks. Portugal opened secondary schools person dining last week. 500 cases/day 20% vaccination (with 1%/day jabs target on).

We'll likely mini wave vaccines take full effect, question bad be. Weather getting better tho help. mRNA vaccines safest ever could redically change health outcomes around world. make vaccine anything now.

There already mRNA AIDS vaccine entering trials.  Dude young people want vaccine. want get understand miniscule risk vaccine vastly outweighed risk covid. agree! looks like someone can't handle reality, throws "" fear mongering"" feel better.

immunity simple like lie yourself, India like 70% anti body previous wave, that's showing useless new mutations. People good delayed gratification. idea of, ""hey thing now, maybe three months see sort benefit"" work normal times. people issues losing weight, starting workout plan, trying wane addictive substances/foods, etc. different pandemic naturally struggled defined end goal. went from, 2 weeks slow spread, trying prevent 2/3 wave, getting vaccine, herd immunity. again, get it, dynamic event, standards change. However, point start working people. 

A common viewpoint I've dealt real life idea of, ""I'll get point, right there's rush. Restrictions stay there's guarantee eventually lead lifting restrictions."" can't even really blame them. There's also certain level of, ""ok right apparent goal get 75% whatever, says shift complete eradication virus hit 75% we'll still follow restrictions."" Every time biden something like getting zoom call mask despite vaccinated, fauci says can't change behavior due (extremely minimal) chance still spread even vaccinated, people going go ""well what's fucking point?"" Well cells get overstimulated often regulate production receptor. Like insulin receptors, dopamine receptors. Sometimes therapeutic, like anti depressants, sometimes causes problems like insulin resistance.

So cells experiencing much stimulation ACE2 binding might regulate receptor production try achieve homeostasis. Part vaccine protective effect might regulation ACE2 production immediately shot, expression might ramp back up. Maybe pfizer vaccine apparently effective within first two weeks ( cells reduce ACE2 expression ) drops bit like 80% months. ( Cells upregulate ACE2 expression ) essentially impossible given many people vaccinated now. agree states reopening soon, see anything like what's happening India. real thing consider massive privilege Americans, many parts country *demand* constrained rather supply constrained. rest world would love problem. Correlation causation now?   past governments ditched ability produce vaccine nationally(to save money), currently mercy foreign imports vaccines. assume trial groups got 2 doses 1 though the, ""emergency use authorization,"" participants supposed given option accept refuse vaccine. part authorization. military cannot mandate yet. case, maybe end courts. dont know yet long first dose effective fair, given travel happy Americans are, surprise every single variant note already spreading US, even vaccines work. Like legitimately cannot reasonably believe Vancouver BC North America's largest P1 case number. Hungary open terraces outdoor areas tomorrow. 

More importantly, next week - 4 million people vaccinated - indoor areas, theaters, cinemas, gyms, bars may open immunity certificates. kidding! fully vaccinated good. took months gym I'm getting back it

Seeing people 'chin diaper' 'dick nose' masks used freak IDGAF  believe Fauci stated we're 10k cases day things start lifted. end near. Thank goodness. Meanwhile Canada delaying second dose four months due lack supply.

This going end poorly probably. like people tell sick people act like wimp, get sick act like die disease forget felt like. sick fun, whether flu, covid19 harmless cold. 

People sick generally stay home spread virus. culture everybody goes work sick sends sick children school act like natural flue seasons common cold going through, nothing done it. Many people Germany upset weight restrictions private life compared work school. Almost compromises made many big companies (small business suffering though). Still suggestion send people home office. Meanwhile, curfews questionable efficacy. Restricting outdoor events pushes people inside, even dangerous. School restrictions still enforced high local cases. 

It's really difficult voice disagreement implementation restrictions without lumped COVID deniers. positive side, learned lot this. learn even scientific analysis reflection done. could much worse pandemic warned several scientists. sense almost like hefty warning shot. Sadly still far away regularly vaccinating people ages 50 70 . B! need drill irrationality head

But upside can‚Äôt eat dairy again. get easily two doses, 95% 100%. Seatbelts 100% preventing injury say eff wear them? faulty product comes could reduce confidence original product. case, particularly bad areas already fighting vaccine hesitancy. 

Just say vaccines produced original company cant bear brand name something. smaller companies especially, could also affect funding research development vaccines, treatments, therapies.

What ""small companies"" producing thes vaccines? multi billion dollar companies. Totally made objection basis real life. Antibodies covid last couple months 95% effective like vaccine. vaccine lasts least 6 month. Instead kept schools open

No, schools reopened state (NRW ) February 22 closed county (and eventually state) week Easter holidays closed ever since . niece nephew 4 weeks person school year ( niece haveing even less quarantine ) disagree. CDC make proclamations evidence pointing toward something, sufficiently observed studied. appropriate, science based way handling it. simply didn‚Äôt answer without opportunity study it. Yeah alright. Tell people tested positive getting vaccine. says I'm complaining? I'm saying give money! Whatever quantity sufficient 'encourage future innovation', world make enough vaccines eradicate scourge covid. Americans exist outside US.

Correlation mean causation friends tend towards anti-vax want show proof. know send... glory prevention. getting lockdown would far far worse!!!!!! really see point. vaccinated prevent anyone carry virus. might moderate symptoms week first dose still infect people around you. That's important remember : vaccinated prevent spreading virus.  Exactly worse? Shamers want people safe hurting others, anti vax want people danger put others danger. ITA. It‚Äôs funny ‚Äúscience deniers‚Äù beginning people didn‚Äôt believe virus even real and/or masks worthless, feels like many people stood science beginning pushing masks distancing NEW science deniers swallowing BS masking ‚Äújust little longer.‚Äù mean, got vaccine. point? work not? works like say, still wear this? you‚Äôre opinion wearing mask required even you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre denying science behind vaccine essentially admitting don‚Äôt think works.  Biden ought start allowing exports raw materials equipment needed vaccine production India produce vaccines. Even sending 10 20 million doses India going make big difference country size India. next one. intensely uneasy feeling whole thing. got lucky already head start SARS vaccine 10 years ago, otherwise we'd **years** out. watching wide swath humanity, especially Americans, reacted putting covering face, means we're pretty much fucked next unknown virus emerges. Unfortunately pandemic carved massive chunk faith humanity able think past bridge nose things help one another, instead diving paranoia, conspiracies *""dOn'T tReAd Me!!11""* people vaccine? argument invalid. listen people want everyone get vaccinated it‚Äôs antibodies.... have. think numbers also support - ~200 cases per day could easily made tourists island. Well considering new administration sitting shit load AZ giving makes think otherwise. right elected though, mid terms election year we'd see us shipping AZ over. AZ even applied EUA yet? absolutely need face reality, still many lives saved, careful avoid black-and-white thinking. not, like, either India Taiwan; lot covid outcomes between. half US adults least one shot capacity *new* surges lower continuing decrease. Forcing something unnecessary harmful authoritarian, forcing life saving vaccine isn't. ~200 cases per day since January

I‚Äôm unsure suddenly makes high risk here, doesn‚Äôt look like anything really changed. doubt. Motive context certainly apply.

As human spread disease fault current rampant abuse cancel culture, it‚Äôs shortsighted think nature. use scapegoats lot scapegoats often justified don‚Äôt deal situations like this.

And globe handled coronavirus poorly.  free cancellation due pandemic conditions? Every flight hotel booking I've making fully refundable (at least via airline vouchers, etc). Makes planning trips (at least within United States, I've succumbed domestic travel year) much easier. Absolutely get reinfected spread still. Pfizer develop vaccine, german company Pfizer production capability teamed up. think German government gave ton BionTec one What's likely?

There's ""more likely"" it. lockdowns masks/social distancing wiping flu. false diagnoses flu covid since mass testing.

In UK use PCR testing confirm reported covid cases, sequence meaning tell covid, variant covid. 

The conspiracy theory flu diagnosed covid nonsense, even live country sequence hell covid cases, trust phenomenon flu driven extinction real based countries like UK testing.

There zero cases flu UK hospitals end last season, compared 10,000 years. Nothing like happened time records existed. There's mistake, said PCR tested sequenced, flu gone (for now). real issue nursing home staff poorly paid crap working conditions. fire everyone vaccinated, brutally understaffed unless massively increase pay improve conditions. Nursing home care already brutally expensive. I'm seeing stated majority Pfizer/BioNTech production US happening Europe.

Can quote it? We're going break sticks, I'm afraid. 

We opportunity vaccinate covid oblivion. can't let continue spread mutate forever like flu did. failed badly covid still bouncing around 100 years now. Close, mask distance forever vaccinated mask distance around 80% vaccinated. irony even close same, EU slightly reducing exports manufacturer fails meet contractual obligations.

If EU tried same, would reduce exports zero well reserve right confiscate vaccines produced outside EU well. Track hospitalizations deaths - cases. It‚Äôs necessarily lying, wasn‚Äôt enough evidence confirm already suspected.

As scientist, unless consistent experimental proof, can‚Äôt confidence hypothesis. Fauci echoing sentiment ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know yet‚Äù.

Obviously also think vaccine prevents spread coronavirus (as vaccines disease prevent), also understand top scientist field would hesitant assert without real evidence. non-zero-percent-chance people still spread disease (which, again, think extremely unlikely) get vaccine, Dr Fauci liar, better doctors peddled hydroxychloroquine.

It‚Äôs high standard, know it‚Äôs frustrating, he‚Äôs trying stay true science make unsubstantiated claims (one biggest no-no‚Äôs science) something huge impact public health. true, live us I‚Äôm thankful able get mine parents Mexico City, already got weeks people 60 got chance get one shot least sub 60 population living limbo, already told friends family come get here, already flight tickets sure trip include shopping trip mall, outlets, takeout food, restaurant even outside beer brewery. spend 10x price vaccine sales tax, including flights, taxis whatever willing spend apart mentioned. know, it‚Äôs control Poland‚Ä¶ (numbers right past 3 month equal US 4-8k dead day, yes thousands per day)

For companies IP (the patents downloaded Internet) without requirements, snow-ball's chance hell they'll able produce quality vaccines least year two. going Covid vaccine glut long that. fact, existing producers may drop market next year.

Even existing vaccine producers like Serum Institute India complaining raw material supplies produce enough vaccines. use would share scarce supplies companies experience, technology, etc.?

All qualified companies sign licensing agreement get proper technology transfer manufacture vaccines appropriate quality management licenser. going here, every state smooth sailing. still challenges several places. Demand issues. supply.

**Opinion:** Visit sort death, look who‚Äôs always top 2-10 past 3 month, worldwide. Yesterday Poland 513 recorded death (Polish people argue ‚Äú20% covid like nobody dies) population equal US (x8.4) 4,300 death. 

Meanwhile everyone makes reasons ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad‚Äù, ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work‚Äù, ‚Äúalmost nobody dies‚Äù, ‚Äúthe vaccine protecting getting anyway‚Äù, ‚Äúif wear mask take vaccine I?‚Äù forth.

Spring bit better, much better since got first shot (second one next week!). 

I'm glad everyone alive, fuck livid weeks. even anti-maskers stay away other. People treat like sex rando STDs. ""It gonna happen me!! Hur durrr!"" syndrome disgustingly prevalent. Fuck. Oh sorry, guess Reddit chinese company Tencent owns 5% shares.

Pfizer even make biggest investment, investment much bigger EU's either. Fun fact, Pfizer even hold rights BNT's vaccine China, Fosun does, even though made smallest investment. Guess BNT Chinese well, then

Edit: wrong, Pfizer invested $185m USD BNT vaccine. Germany actually invested double, convert Euros. Germany invested ~$445m USD BNT Facts. weren‚Äôt war. Maybe 40-50 years...who knows? hope country becomes safe reach full potential one day. think depends. Older places might get away renovations required inspected, case bring code pass. inspector worth shit, anyways. went exactly 0 strength least decent body weight exercises like pull ups, push ups, squats, hanging leg raises.

Probably sound like much anyone exercise before, shit first like push ups knees start still go way down... pretty bad. 

Still need work cardio though join actual gym im done vaccinating Wow, absolutely excellent counter argument, sure able pack lot facts reasoning! well [Youyang model pretty amazingly spot on. expects vaccination rates really drop hard.  early May, back Feb levels mid May back Jan levels. people naturally covid immune?

In line reply, think research support immunity rather many people become contagious - contagious. Something like 10% people responsible 90% transmissions; people spread even household family members, etc. 

So probably wife resistant one. Sounds like two quarantining together! I‚Äôve put 10. three given US extremely effective preventing infection spread. ‚ÄúThis Indian variant gonna wreck [sic] havoc us‚Äù

It is? Thanks ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù Ah okay based CDC guidance. I'm saying stay inside wear masks forever (I know sub loves assume)

Yes, ""skeptics"" use lot bad-faith black-and-white arguments, particularly like bring flu. seem taken aback suggest reasonable flu mitigation strategies reflect much lower (but still significant) death toll compared covid. No, one thinks lock flu. Yes, masking public December February could helpful. What's deal Modi's coalition? Seems like they're always clinging power.

Idk there's American bias/under 40 bias ask Indians US think typically favorable exceptions. Maybe covid response hurt party's popularity?

Edit: idk matters noticed Indians US longer typically critical ideals. Could j&amp;j applied men order reduce affected demographic even further? go somewhere else second appointment! make sure vaccine first one, sure bring vaccination card appointment verify. Walgreens, Walmart CVS allow specify booking second dose. Damage done imo, particularly young women. 

There‚Äôs stats there‚Äôs emotional response. know beneficial yet I‚Äôd still bit concerned sister, partner, women friends age, etc got it. Pretty sure point someone doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated don‚Äôt need wear masks protect them. get it, get it. Also it‚Äôs almost impossible overrun hospitals, many people vaccinated. Look place like nyc. You‚Äôre telling weak vulnerable people existing fourteen months suddenly get sick date future, like March 2020? Cool, sanction us :-) Americans always gain weight? think turned corner soon here; soon people got vaccinated everyone pushing ""the pandemic over"" narrative. pandemic actually over, IMO, whenever everyone wants get vaccinated get vaccinated. then, vaccinated people go partying selfish would ensured people yet eligible would also.

Are yet? might be, right? time public messaging change completely switch ""once get vaccinated pandemic you"". I've gained 10 pounds since last August I'm hoping gain another 15 pounds fall. old days would hang ringleaders put rest half grog rations. now?

So...like country article good example manipulate readers using confusing data.

The article uses ‚Äúage-adjusted death rate‚Äù mislabels excess death.

Age-adjusted death rate 1918 compared previous five years:

+14.8%

Death rate 1918 compared previous five years:

+33.0% numbers start drop next week. pointless emergency brake, will. Wow, expressed badly! Thank catching it. clarify, fine droplets hang air 20 minutes - inside! believe discovered 'sneeze' tests performed early pandemic. 

I sad people careful, still caught virus. know how. Bay Area California, travel restrictions put place really confused people. health department explain, ordered gas station/mini mart rest stop bathrooms locked. ventilation. go park visit restaurants fun sans mask - take mask bathroom. civil. civil. hyperbole actually say that? addition less active, factor stresses added living life pandemic. put weight past year, myself, attribute stress, stress eating, lack sleep. Thank info. easier preserve too? cities today take way space huge sprawling suburbs possible widespread car use, plus building regulations, back would people tightly packed centre poorly built slums. population Manhattan (still densely populated US county) actually peaked 1910s. Uh WHOLE YEAR.

I really hope trolling misinformed. misinformed willful ignorance. Maldives 4th behind Seychelles, Bhutan, Israel terms percentage population received least one dose (55%).

But appear used UK strategy giving many people one dose possible fully vaccinating people. So, **11% Maldives population fully vaccinated**, putting 15th highest statistic, compared 27% United States population fully vaccinated, 31% Chile, 56% Israel, That‚Äôs funny benefits outweigh risks psychologically/financially/healthwise society open everything 100% still don‚Äôt it..

At least, please please ask downvoting comment. Truly. Matter fact would cool replied reason. tables turned American went Chile Brazil get vaccinated would getting obliterated taking vaccines local population....how different?

The US send extra vaccines countries distribute to.their citizens helps world get vaccinated. Practically speaking, vaccines would go unused properly redistributed inside US places need I've heard news today someone went Maldives escape holiday cought there. private pharma hospital execs give big fat bonuses. vaccinated countries talking about? states? Nope, UK? Nope. Israel? Nope. 

No countries vaccinated enough make claim. Hey. awesome. Mad respect. went every one doses last week. need more... comment definitely sarcastic anything. Indian citizen dying street, Bahrain fully vaccinated means nothing. Since Indian government gave away vaccines Bahrain instead vaccinating citizens need way more. really. always going slow 50% adults it. 

Polling shows 60-70% adults willing take vaccine, 52.6%. assume hit high mark 70%, 75% way people. never going go peak doses (about 2 million day first doses peak) stay till hit 70%.

And J&amp;J coming back, help numbers little. 

We also probably need get 50-55% total population vaccinated.  theres going pretty big gaps highest vaxxed areas lowest. Thats going biggest concern (but health officials, me. im vaxxed, time live life again) actually really interesting idea (not imply isnt fact). roll eyes people say grandma going die anyway. However nursing home residents making flu season gamble. would like think lose significant amount lives group, maybe saved preventative measures too. 

If nothing else hope people learned deadly flu season older generation. never flu before, dont even consider flu shot. year made realize possible flu didnt realize symptoms light didnt fit mold. get next year would likely already spreading realized, could part chain contributes ending someone's life. I'm saying stay inside wear masks forever (I know sub loves assume) putting flu shots, disinfecting, socially distancing possible (I never really wanted stand close people line, anyway) normal practice flu season. Request mean accepted. used every dose last week  second one didnt hurt felt liquid go much first  Could vaccinate Canada doses would gladly take them. UK way worked. additional 30% lying... Especially US. way lot more.  Could 60 70,000 deaths counted. sad part never know. know wrecking havoc places like India US. bother, can't reason somebody position reason into.

That's always show threads state exact opposite ignorant preconceived ideas, cognitive dissonance requires argue facts order avoid admitting they've duped themselves.  What's fires thumbnail? don‚Äôt understand post. Consumables syringes ? broken science sub yesterday. paper Jan. Seems like fearmongering repost 3 months later sniff issue.... See: Anything semi-anti-India downvoted infernal hell  isnt even first followup testing asymptomatic infection... seeing likely random variation 80/90 reported cell. raw material used producing az vaccine. Thanks! honest need hear ok. 

And pleasantly surprised happy effectiveness first dose hiking, paddling, walking dog, riding bicycle, swimming approximately isolating? India variant. happens can't get world vaccinated quickly would think that, Canada literally went entire supply astra Zeneca last week that‚Äôs thing offered 40-65 age range. Sounds like practical application trolly problem. Food one available comforts lockdown world. simple.  repost sub seeing discussion /r/covid19 yesterday? seen there's good info there. Mid March 1 year mark big jump too. think would affect much mentally, did. Something about, ""we've shit *year*"" hits mentally. you‚Äôre going post here, try use pieces written children completely ignoring point. great day. willingly give people aspirin kills 20 per million. murder? keep going back ""auspicious""...maybe spread covid among population, yes. long term covid absolutely needs considered frightening seem understanding behind others experience it.
What know 80% severe illnesses death US people obesity (diabetes, HBP, etc..) Something also needs considered. risk? Get exercise eat whole foods. missing conversations well. like smoking gun one wans look. dont people realize this. Anti-lockdown people always wait 2 weeks see cases rose much claim lockdowns dont work. take couple months wave get rolling. R value includes social behavior. Thats unique Oregon. unique Washington made sign ups eligibility extremely complicated restrictive took hold younger populations better. eligible obese asthma, spread much better wider net fewer places gain hold.

The states age wider groups people eligible better super picky arms vaccine go into. help either many eligible people confused whether eligible sign everyone eligible. Employees placed risk every day! Ask police officer, fireman, construction worker, truck driver, or, um, doctors nurses working hospitals. 

The risks vaccines absolutely trivial compared these, hospital staff take bigger risks commuting work day! see sentiment parroted lot given?

Some people need told explicitly happen. Yah seeing lot vaccine snobs comments. Meanwhile Canada people taking whatever fuck offered. don‚Äôt choice. one 40 get vaccine yet. India  paper Jan sudden reposted (was discussed heavily 2 threads science sub /r/covid19 yesterday - [Here - 
 
Seems like anti-vax push me. stats based current levels risk infection, 1 million women getting covid.  Every wave last year come warning. ‚ÄúYoung getting much sicker infected higher rates‚Äù. purposeful propaganda keep young people home. game telephone story changes time evolves gets told. posting nonsense thread American hospital? never considered new variants, apparently. things like happening world, Netherlands decided loosen measure ~10k cases daily. hope Christmas things relatively back normal, hope things back normal next two years.

Everytime looks like things going better, new wave comes along. pathetic rate vaccinating here, yea, we'll another locked Christmas. Agreed. least lay clear goal policy level. moment incentive restrictions lifted communicated properly. see sentiment parroted lot given? must continue wear masks distance enough vaccinated cases fall. People must pretty dense think otherwise. Oh wait... again, emotional argument science. point view back data. hope assumptions officials made work don‚Äôt cause serious damage. Good day. Sure, death rates higher seniors, let alone teachers. Yes, know 2 ?

Are genetic markers, traits would tell us affected serious adverse effects? random?

If are, yet still give vaccine knowingly sure die, murder? imagine also difficult determine efficacy based time virus incubation period 2-14 days. also plausible vaccine might shift recipients higher side incubation period, would interesting contact tracing could shed light this.

For example, days cohort exposed vaccination longer incubation periods. could mean protection days actually higher exposure come days 1-6 vaccination. say uncontrollable. simply say life lot people lived led weight gain. many factors involved, depression, physical health, family life... One can't say 'i've lost weight every body else too.' I'm talking myself, mean people general. cut beer dusted Peloton. I'll fine. confirm. Gained 10 lbs past year stopped going gym. 

Return first time today 6 months got second dose days ago. maintained weight throughout pandemic. working in-person work home. made adjustments diet activity level. really hard. Take responsibility. I‚Äôm sorry family friends, really cannot imagine anguish.

It feels surveys failed, what‚Äôs considered herd immunity straight wrong. It‚Äôs absolutely possible probable poorest would undersampledStatistical analysis still totally wrong even everything done reasonably well. 

Given seems political necessities pressures India, could analysis would perhaps independent enough fudged, biases accounted for. look initial approaches Sweden, UK, pretty much entirety US way point examples this. never trust CDC again, used consider absolutely nonpartisan technocrats.

Everybody knows reinfection occur. Everybody knows exponential growth happens. Everybody knows vaccine timelines, healthcare capabilities etc.

I gobsmacked Indian gov know x hospital beds, x hospital staff, x liters o2, x ventilators unable develop models‚Äîjust based infection rate compare last year‚Äîand know shut things down.  absolute dereliction. feels preventable it‚Äôs evil. wonder first Covid rom coms drop. 

‚ÄúComing summer... Despite mask lockdown standing them, nothing could keep apart!‚Äù willing sacrifice even 2 women could give different vaccine without risks?

Is someone making women take J&amp;J shot? EUA updated mention risks, information provided patients prior getting shot. point free make whichever choice want, armed facts. part ""any reason"" understand? Vaccine avoidance protected class. certainly true. pay higher prices meds rest world cheaper cost. Hey, feel bad way mourn. non-verbal stoic ass mom died 10+ years ago put 10 year old cat got right died, lost goddamn mind like month. Brains weird. Positivity rate cases Michigan plummeted last 10 days, without new restrictions. ebb flow virus getting pretty predictable. hope right. worry optics ""America first"" get way logic. look what's happening 20 million AZ doses gathering dust American warehouses. Placeebee? soon forgo public safety measures put place, wearing mask hand washing, warned. 

And yet again.

Give people reason actually go get vaccine. Tell mask wearing goes away I'm sure get people getting vaccine. Maybe anecdotal evidence, second shot hurt felt ""spicy"" makes sense. Like, feel first shot second hurt more. MDPI ü§Æ Shh, we're public, hear /s Best luck speedy recovery, push hard! think answered question comment. wondering changed. worried India 2020. Millions people window receiving shot onset side effects. pause wait see incidence worse thought. 593 deaths/million 0.059% mortality rate (for covid), right?

Or calculate saved number? That's even true, India China produce way pharmaceuticals America, sell cheaper, even true... Fine, America continue first dibs, they're stockpiling faster administer, limited exports start without affecting American rollout one bit.  suggested otherwise? dick least solace knowing Bahrain safe vaccinated. may caught COVID-19, certainly caught COVID 19.  They're bringing money hotels, car rentals, airlines, restaurants, shopping malls. industries hit hard pandemic.

That money spent superior cost vaccine itself. meme internet call America 3rd world.

Numbers don‚Äôt always reflect health. wife lost weight, WFH opened time daily exercise used commuting. expect last forced back office. Even dog gained 31 lbs. US

Oh think headquartered US? think anything US tax policies extremely business friendly?  Yeeaaahhhh joke - false positive rate tests used sample size population tested find result? 

I know pcr false positives ‚Äúrare‚Äù especially high cycle counts they‚Äôre often-enough indicative prior infection that‚Äôs longer active, exposure virus infection. rate high order really skew results like it‚Äôs frustrating see questions around dismissed conspiratorial. Clinical diagnosis active infection something PCR actually well suited for. unlikely variant able completely ignore vaccine. Vaccine efficacy might lower, zero, likely vaccine would still protect severe disease. major vaccines target spike, spike change much still wants able bind human ACE2 receptor. Plus, there's cell immunity (which primarily protects severe disease), viruses much slower learning circumvent that. 

That said, still know enough Indian variant. appear degree immune escape appears spread faster wild type likely even British variant (though one clear). 

You remember, though, India country little regulations like wearing masks (God forbid home office), HUGE population density, vaccination rates mid high single digits (not nearly enough see kind effect), fuck-ton religious ceremonies protests require people gather huge numbers. So, countries would likely suffer disastrous consequences variant India suffering, simply India. I'm still taking chances variant, think reason think we're completely fucked start over. Yeah, woman party 5 days first dose? even surprise got infected....? Seems pretty stupid irresponsible me. one fully vaccinated 2 weeks second dose, even it‚Äôs still possible get infected. Duh. many people wasting time commuting, lot time exercise.

It seems like lot people found replacing commute time extra hours working.

I agree subreddit might've jumped gun Feb/March bit though. Even distance, risk isn‚Äôt 0, take it? It‚Äôs small inconvenience. everybody months, we‚Äôd fully eradicate Covid. /s Flu deaths did. Pneumonia deaths quadrupled. condition pharma companies don‚Äôt IP using suspended IP rights sell cost can‚Äôt profit IP. Let‚Äôs see many willing to. good estimates fast Covid spreads pre-Covid environment, virus began spreading many populations taking precautions.

That rate somewhere around 3-5 new infections per infected person. vaccine cuts infections/contagious people 85-95%, number drops 1 new infection per infected person virus struggles spread dies naturally like flu summer it‚Äôs rate infection drops one one warmer weather. You‚Äôre really good reading comprehension :(

Don't naive. Business always existed make profit. Everything else side effect that. lol certainly have. It‚Äôs okay though, it‚Äôs tough time everyone, little weight gain isn‚Äôt huge deal. Yeah, lost weight sadness. don‚Äôt mind weight loss. get uncomfortable admitting it‚Äôs gone. far, though, it‚Äôs pretty easy shrug off. say, ‚ÄúCovid diet. hate cooking!‚Äù seems move conversation on. risks medication always disclosed. It‚Äôs usually little information packet one reads. would unethical let people know. Half million dead counting.

Big box stores typically big concentric diffusers, big square things ceiling like Walmart.

Pfizer company again? headquartered again? say, try... blind study may also contribute. Vaccinated people might take risks unvaccinated people mean agree restrict freedoms. freedom win gun, go around shooting people. It‚Äôs good thing took freedom away. brazil also using AZ vaccine 2nd dose 3 months first one yet people arguing whole pandemic rules trust people's ability make risk assessments (ie. analysis based complex decision making framework) let ""personal responsibility"" rule. Yeah seriously people pulled timelines right ass. Random redditors really authority making predictions like 368k doses today, equivalent 3.25M US!!  2nd wave reports cities India much 50% citizens antibodies, Delhi one them, thats city 20M inhabitants 1.4% total Indian population. pretty clear first wave also much million daily cases, see wave would different.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* go  Pretty sure random. There's anecdotes say likely get strong reaction one dose, actual limited research (and anecdotes friends) say otherwise.

Try really get hydrated second shot. I'm insider, CA tightness made news rest day day Europe literally allowed export significant portion mRNA production Europe, basically whatever bought countries. That's well 100 million doses. Probably around/over 150 million doses now. also explicitly export control low middle income countries COVAX, even countries, blocked 1 export 250,000 AstraZeneca doses Australia. nothing compared done world allowing exports massive scale letting countries buy EU production. AstraZeneca probably deliver one third doses EU bought (that 200 million missing vaccines). regard, US EU complete opposites, cannot same. I'd take vaccine Covid. lot things ""last resort"" used pretty poorly. lot (a lot!) people genuinely thought 6.0001 feet completely safe. maybe good number people totally stopped following CDC guidance realize it‚Äôs totally arbitrary developed condescending mindset described. make risk assessments.

People use decision-making framework every choice lives. wish articles would take look real structural problems information delivery systems. similar article popped /r/bayarea recently thousands appointments Santa Clara county went without takers, implying ""unwanted."" real problem one could find existing crappy California myturn site.

It's great many popup sites, they're useless one find them! 

The reason able get shot early-- 16-49 opened Cali 15th, county April 2-- following Reddit virtually DDOSing county site. read Reddit, slobbering trying get vaccinated, happen register random state link found somewhere, clue know eligible.

Information dissemination critical reaching everyone wants willing get shot(s). Sadly, seems like we're giving really started. please say works go back someone standing immediately behind line?! correct. headline reflect adults, Canadians. misleading update it. really wonder about. US going need many Pfizer doses soon unless booster future (possibly). US production go somewhere. That's I'm surprised Australia think get lots Pfizer doses Q4. TIL. I've paying attention covid news, never even heard peep oxygen issues. second dose needed get last longer.
the AZ vaccine best one countries need vaccinate people right (basically everyone minus US), first dose grants enough protection 22 days. know getting downvoted polling looking like 60-65% closer 60% since J&amp;J debacle totally understand point, agree people likely get vaccine ‚ÄúYour‚Äù doctor. 

But would anyone trust government? themselves, anyone thinks either party individual best interests mind delusional. blame citizens getting vaccine ‚ÄúAll‚Äù politicians politicizing COVID. 

Get vaccine, politicians go get fucked, either party ass That's good bad headline, conversation another thread. 75% adults said. currently 34%, averaging 1% day. Polling shows 80% Canadians amenable getting vaccine can‚Äôt give number ever something like super Ebola public opinion would turn favor vaccinations quickly. Teachers want go back governor ordered return. dumb hell.

I think state country vaccinate teachers elderly. know, ones dying droves? medical advice health specialists. rightly saying elderly need vaccines first...

I'm glad Kate Brown, governor, can't run reelection 2022. I'm sure something happens significant immune response. hate dismissed. side effect regardless. also got headache fever vaccine gave me. get headache fevers. Still makes side effect. probably tested way J&amp;J tested, vanilla COVID19 variants stuff (just guess) Oh boy. Something watch suppose. Moderna could similar COVID level smallpox.

The government right force things people‚Äôs bodies. Let nature sort antivaxxers. Nothing life zero risk. healthy male 30s still something like 1/10,000 chance death COVID, relatively high (1%? 10%? 30%? studies differ.) chance symptoms month.

On hand driving 10 miles get vaccine carries 1/10,000,000 chance death fatal car accident. risk shot may similar. effective rate drop 10%? Thought 95%? Yes, coworker immunocompromised. husband getting vaccinated he'll ""risk it"" says. take would protect wife much himself. cannot take yet trials people using similar drugs positive. wait choice, get it. never many cases

Absolute bullshit, they're broadcasting caseload. information determine numbers high low. government conflict interest complete control press geopolitical desire source virus keep numbers low Pakistani share many cultural things India. 
They think superior think better immunity.

Our drinking different things sanitary developed world. 


So people develop immunity. 
Western people eating Indian food often get diarherai. 
While people eat day. 


Some people thought immunity would also protect Covid. 


Secondly, Indian vegetarians thought vegetarian lifestyle would protect Covid. Same. thing happened actually Covid, too. exact symptoms, menstrual disruption both. Nah, policy could read ‚ÄúVaccination Policy: require vaccinations requirement employment.‚Äù Right? Florida PSAs along lines ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre vaccinated, nothing life going change still need wear mask/social distance/etc.‚Äù

It‚Äôs wonders convince people get vaccinated. J&amp;J back expect massive increase vaccines distributed next week US? imagine must 10M+ stockpiled past 2 weeks. think Pfizer delivery pace gonna ramp lot early May 10m per week allowing much robust daily admin without risk running out. think conditions employment forcing someone something?

Its free country. No-one forced work anywhere. I‚Äôm boat. went grad school get mom dig old boxes find vaccination records would get mumps rubella inoculations again, what‚Äôs difference covid vaccine??? building recently elections festivals. However, there's definitely multiple mutated strains capable infecting people easily. live Massachusetts. Everywhere area booked unfortunately places long drive to. don‚Äôt want take vaccine get sick stuck far away home. stayed weight. lost least 10 lbs muscle. I‚Äôm back gym trying get back lose fat. Yeah, I'm you. cardio fitness probably best ever been, getting outdoors exercising real thing do. Idk working home makes huge difference here, office still sitting around day might even grab fast food lunch. two months got work home found going jogs work since sit traffic. Could depression anything, I'm surprised something mentioned get short comment came negatively. added edit wanted make point one particularly well within control individual chalking ‚Äòthe pandemic‚Äô cop aren‚Äôt vaccinated. Also don‚Äôt rights grandchildren. I‚Äôm parent. make rules. wonder, India reaching may actually run many tests give day? Like may get point 500k ‚Äúofficial‚Äù cases per day, insane amount tests consider negative tests too. tend agree, give people carrot encourage people get vaccine. 

In personal case, entire family vaccinated lifted enormous weight shoulders sleep better night. Firstly, control? feel like given year - ~61% people would gain weight considering ppl gain weight age. 

Secondly, article says 61% people saw undesired weight changes. include ppl losing weight cuz stress, unemployment, sickness, etc. That‚Äôs desirable either. title thus, incorrect. 61% gain, 61% saw weight fluctuations. Living St. Louis watched task force daily/weekly basically year I've impressed handling everything. They've presented ton data, done fairly good job modeling, level-headed throughout whole pandemic.

I however disappointed presentation yesterday feel like fallen issue seeing throughout country, inability find way pandemic. Obviously vaccination way out, needs realistic discussion plan get see herd immunity reasonable goal near future, especially without vaccinating children. public health leaders really need open thoughts go longer obfuscate dream herd immunity people going stop listening.

I agree point easing restrictions yet, may getting close needs discussion what/when looks like anyone know estimate number deaths given year? trying find answer case conspiracy theorist claims intentionally estimated low Covid started. mask isn‚Äôt 100% safe either - it‚Äôs getting decent odds - it‚Äôs 100% safe - like safety belts doesn‚Äôt make safe getting killed driving - that‚Äôs say 6 feet proper distance - comment misleading? live supposedly one hardest hit US states even know anyone mildly symptomatic, entire year, nobody died. news someone know passing away every 5 6 hours sounds like could different game... hope not.
