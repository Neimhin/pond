again, CDC says need to, will, go back wearing mask (or social distancing, staying home, etc.), people refused get vaccinated seems ridiculous me. don‚Äôt want get sick die, point, it‚Äôs them. ""I felt threatened!!"" [Vaccinations increasing looks like Delta needle moving fence sitters getting shots. Thanks this. personally, absolutely would  Exactly. many still think doctors secretly killing flu. üôÑ wear masks another semester socially empty college might lose mind fucking hell. I‚Äôm angry disappointed point. way out? way out? many thousands going pay sit dorm alone see professors faces? Yes? Lol true! Yep, say lot friends, family &amp; business associates little reluctant take vaccine NZ become readily available. problem threat Covid see therefore motivating factor. super lucky, see issues ahead us. Me, see looming outbreak lock restrictions Australia facing.  Dang that‚Äôs insane , saw Florida 9,000 . bad per population compared Louisiana. folks even get life?

Faith-based belief system. detached reality believe magic. Look another good data point especially considering it‚Äôs February backs 99.5% There's much point mandate there's many loopholes

It's security theater. Still slightly better becoming nihilist paramedic  lot us taken except small gatherings vaccinated people. People pissed ""forever masking"" got whole lot near unavoidable, permanent changes way life coming pike coming years. Buckle up, buttercups. ain't seen nothing yet. Yahoo News/YouGov poll conducted July 13-15 released Tuesday shows 37% unvaccinated Americans think vaccines riskier COVID-19, McClatchy News reported.

These horrifyingly stupid people. understandable. wish people would quit saying ""It's protect others, you!"" I've seen evidence true, frankly want people wear masks going need appeal selfish side. various videos acknowledge vaccinated.

Shawn Hannitty basically acknowledging he's vaccinated though think says right, though might written 3 Fox morons admitting pronounce ‚Äúgop‚Äù like hop nope?

I prefer rhymes hop even bother anything what's point? would like get vaccinated extremely afraid, OCD/health anxiety. Yes, realize people going say OCD/health anxiety taking vaccine makes sense worried getting Covid.

The difference mind though getting vaccine 100% thing. 100% putting vaccine body make choice go get vaccinated.
Dying Covid 19 gamble. 

So, makes really hard decision make someone scared take antibiotics even times. 

I know vast majority mild reactions/side effects, health paranoia person rare cases worried about. also scares vaccine new created quickly.


Any advice? calling idiot something obvious like that.. concerns valid. I'm trying anti vaxxer. aunt got vaccinated happy did. I'm one ones telling people they're stupid think getting vaccine.

Edit: oh that's NY. countrywide Agreed. go IU sounds like they're giving religious exemptions like candy. paperwork required; automatic approval mostly political objections, religious ones. asked IU's health board would release vaccination data, including % students vaccine exemptions, yet decided whether they'll make info public. mention fact students required upload vaccine card verify indeed fully vaccinated. There's much point mandate there's many loopholes anti-vaxxers abuse. science that‚Äôs denied? UK 18's account 20.3% population. no, you‚Äôre addressing points either us making. Well, course. bunch vaccinated people walking around maskless still potentially carrying virus, it'll inevitably reach unvaccinated even communities high vaccination rates. people able choose race society identified may comparison. OP said calling disagree ‚Äústupid‚Äù help. called stupid. Yeah reality cloth mask won‚Äôt fully protect still offers better nothing protection. folks claim masks don‚Äôt help think viral load constant factor reality vary. Nope, don‚Äôt want commiseration.

China needs drastically increase donations aids neighbors. No, adenovector.   curiosity, get sick often common illnesses, like flu cold? 

I rarely get sick (like every years) even I'm literally sharing bed husband he's sick, I've curious body would handle covid exposure (although I'm fully vaccinated point). yet athletes still getting infected.

Yeah, shows Long-COVID correlated health factors, don‚Äôt buy fear-mongering mindlessly reading headlines. Exactly this. But... this. I'm vaccinated, still choose wear mask. Mainly 3 reasons tho. 
1. want get it. Even tho I'm vaccinated still get it. kill even put hospital (well, least 99% vaccinated), mean get long term effects. want those.
 2. get know (cuz, let's say got mild case know it), still spread can't get vaccine (Children immunocompromised. people qualms trying help protect!).
3. want help pass virus along becomes mutated variant becomes non-responsive vaccines. (Which going do.) 

I know people say, ""Well, saying listen science CDC says vaccinated people need wear mask."" say...well...see above. 

My county fully vaccinated rate around 40%. Maybe 10% people see grocery store, etc., wearing mask. Therefore, unvaccinated people either responsible going or, likely, responsible. Therefore , continue wear mask. 
And...if matters...I'm doctor. histrionics US congresspersons, find quite hilarious.  Never stopped wearing masks indoors. employment. vaccination choices covered class? sources?

Okay, given belief they're making rational decision. 63% unvaccinated Americans think vaccine less risky COVID-19? getting vaccinated? second dose beginning January, interested hearing boosters. Lol ... too. imagine already thin ice donors happened January 6th. anti-vax rhetoric causes local leaders reinstate NPIs like mask mandates capacity restrictions, that's economic damage potential donors. Unlike sub think, mask mandates capacity restrictions negative economic effects many small businesses like restaurants, live entertainment venues, gyms ect.

The mRNA instructs body produce spike protein, recognised 'foreign' would generate immune response (e.g. antibodies spike protein produced).

I want add Viral Vector vaccines (Astra JnJ) use modified Adenovirus vector delivier DNA cells. cells transcribe instructions mRNA prompts cells produce spike protein.

Yeah basically. town mask mandate like 6 weeks enforced, peak think 40% people wearing masks. never rush get vaccines (tiered groups actually opened faster planned), hitting around 50% 1 dose. unvaxxed spreading other, never wore mask first place, they're ones paying price now.

I'm even sure immune compromised people worse before... always flu everything else susceptible better options like everywhere offering curbside delivery, work home, etc. Exactly.

If tell puts people risk, also doesnt care, literally doesnt care, view bigger ignorant threat keep driving SUV fuel based car general. (Or simply act like dont care climat)

He literally said wont take shot, people deserve get virus long act ignorant towards climate change, view covid minor problem.

And doesnt care got sick himself, told pull plug case ends hospital. ever get sick, don‚Äôt bother going hospital would advice you. You‚Äôll hate it. Well heck worse?

It already pretty bad original study - lol. hard act sympathetic really seething inside? Like, already know able compassionate people, see television read online. I'd probably fly rage ever deal person.

I sincerely commend hard work! Stay safe! Absolutely, healthcare workers work help can. servants, slaves treated such!  Time set anti-vax colonies Well let‚Äôs let virus sort things us, I‚Äôm trying make 2022 happened 95% effective preventing infection? Seems like long ago‚Ä¶ chem grad take grain salt.

The spike protein change. delta variant spike binds readily receptor that's spreads easily (takes less viral load.) ultimately still similar enough immune system recognizes relatively small change. 

I suppose could become specialized enough vaccine antibodies slightly worse holding onto them, doubt lose effectiveness long targets receptor. 

As moving receptors, seems pretty big stretch. still pretty specific surfaces bind remember one unit protein every three DNA bases. would take lot evolutionary pressure cause many changes stick once. can't really go piecewise changes time new receptor, again, strongest binds often spread small changes probably poor attempts match receptor.

So, COULD happen, likely even probably stick around spread. think read similar news year half year ago...Why need learn experience history repeats again? Effective lot work here. Anything I've read seems state risk severe outcomes, death, hospitalizations among kids delta changed tyrosine-kinase inhibitor used treatment mast cell tumours animals, specifically dogs. Since introduction November 2008 distributed commercial name Masivet. available Europe since second part genome sequence virus encoding spike protein changes enough without affecting virus' ability enter hosts cells vaccine definitely less effective. E-484k mutation iirc currently considered one mutations.  Ah, classic they‚Äôre/their/there mishap US, people gotten vacconated done choice. avilability vaccines there, 95% minimum, Nah, serious, sub totally decided think CDC right wrong, even though CDC workhorse analyzing data looking trends Nope, live ventura county; mandate yet Look comment upthread. 

About 17% tested positive last week vaccinated. double shot 88% effective Delta compared 96% Alpha version. 

When dealing millions people - 8% matters. Lifting mask mandate dumb. why.     sussposed say that? Sorry sympathy people find position could easily got vaccine months ago unless medically can't. usually give doctors nurses hard time told covid also take valuable icu space could used people major medical issues disease part hospitalization cools almost 100 percent avoidable. umvaccimated made choice long ago. speaking country vaccine available all.

Don't worry happens faster think. I'm Canada 30 month ago would never thought would got 2nd shots much early. didnt kill friendships, Ive got vaccinated dont care rest.

I born Hirschsprung Disease later got Crohn's it, Im used nobody gives fuck, surely killy friendships now. Wear one anyway. That's true. hate ""heavy lifting"" stupid people? Thing matter. Stupid people c'aint learnt  could would render virus potent. Might even eventual end game Slowbrain Absolutely. children almost everything dangerous vaccinated visitors over. Also nothing suggests children high risk complications caused delta variant. MD talk success. ""Look much better last guy! I've got us back normal! Mission accomplished!""

(Note; obviously better last guy) Gotta catch 'em IIRC, people sub okay opening due perceived low risk break cases kids suffering infection Well, know Spain Portugal certain age groups can't go get vaccinated. 23+ book vaccines still, people 30 still waiting get booked. Early 30 year olds called recently either still waiting appointment got first shot.

My 20 year old brother eager get vaccinated know happens goes get shot? Nobody give him. assume entire world like US, France UK shots free go get 18+ correct, sir. dealing new things best careful. People take study run .....and months later we'll find something totally different. Can‚Äôt believe people still ducking crying wearing mask. I‚Äôll wearing one full time work problem hot conditions. Stop whining idiot. long US getting like UK. Japan award Gold, Silver, Bronze medals countries athletes diagnosed COVID. Call corona medal. rest countries also get take home corona caught consolation prize catch, transmit, they're far less likely get sick and/or die. Mutation rate nowhere near influenza's. Fully support. non essential travel pleas like 60,000 new cases today. first time months. There's cause concern here. Speaking televised town hall Cincinnati Wednesday, hosted CNN, Biden said children 12, currently ineligible three coronavirus vaccines available US, could get shots August later fall. Fox truthful US courts:  User deleted look Thats point control group. control group get reality check.  I‚Äôm sorry loss. 
Protect love. 10% chance passing COVID fully vaccinated 

I never seen numbers vaccinated people *transmit* virus. I've seen 90% reduced chance *contract* virus. 
 
Where'd get number from? 
 
----- 
 people catch it, 99.86% hospitalized saved long term fatalities  
 
And know fact false. vaccines reduce chance severe disease including death [about 
 
The regular hospitalization rate 10%, looking 5% hospitalization rate *do* manage contract fully vaccinated. .014%. **highly highly highly highly highly highly** unlikely get COVID groceries it‚Äôs reasonable wipe down.

As doctor, stop spreading sensationalism.

""As points out, difficult disentangle relative contributions inhaled droplets contaminated surfaces, people come contact potentially infectious surfaces generally also close contact infected individuals""

""Poor hand hygiene associated increased risk infection among health care workers, daily use chlorine ethanol cleaning products household associated decreased risk (54, 70).""

""However, clear proportion SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired surface transmission""

""Fomite transmission difficult prove definitively, part respiratory transmission asymptomatic people cannot ruled out""

""Case reports indicate SARS-CoV-2 transmitted people touching surfaces ill person recently coughed sneezed on, directly touching mouth, nose, eyes 3, 4, 5. Hand hygiene barrier fomite transmission associated lower risk infection 6.""

""In cell culture studies, SARS-CoV-2 described remain infectious stainless steel plastic three four days, glass banknotes two days, wood one day, decrease viral infectivity time""

As see science far settled CDC based guidance 2 meta-analyses, far definitive. Question: Hello all, good redditors. online gaming friend Arizona. talk sometimes covid, I'm UK got Delta first know freaking transmissible is. Yesterday mentioned got 2nd jab finally (yay!) obviously asked side effects - watches Fox Oan. really nice, creative person lapped BS.

I said 200% transmissible. Delta multiplies 100x fast Alpha, spread like wildfire community anyone knows it. sent graphs showing vaccinated UK helped Delta; deaths covid 0.16% infected (2%+ before), hospitalisations 2% (10% before), never say overtly ""You get vaccine"". always ends convo saying ""I've got heart condition (mid 50s), getting jab high-risk"" tell stay away people indoors. Every time. even say ""See doctor that"" work.

Anyone data, people heart conditions getting vaccine? pry ask condition has, data would nice. Thanks! agree.

I feel bad people refused vaccine sick.  one study conflicts studies. say something proven based makes better antivaxxers cherrypick one study support narrative.

We need stay vigilant. honestly feel bad people all.

Even still everything strategically vaccinate unvaccinated. Besides possibility variants, things blow end harming innocent, overwhelming medical personnel healthcare system general, infecting can't get vaccinated like children immunocompromised. Oh, brains shut long got hospital! *truly* believed respected God, would make better use amazing brain put heads! Similar - 2 year old I‚Äôm pregnant. Would continue mask 2 year olds sake even vaccinated I‚Äôm considered high risk since I‚Äôm pregnant. Unfortunately areas would take loved one die disease. I‚Äôm even sure would it. Biden didn‚Äôt tell indication encourage vaccination. wasn‚Äôt political. least vaccinated age group making lot cases? I‚Äôm shocked! vaccine awesome, protect 100% certainty.

When catch virus someone there's still 37% chance symptoms.

And 7% chance might hospitalize (depends age, fitness, immune system, ... 93% effective average).

I'm fully vaccinated still wearing mask (though law country, everybody does). Personally I'm concerned catching virus I'm vaccinated, I'd still prefer could avoid it. idiots subreddit keep making politics, playing role obviously, nevertheless find fascinating liberal age demographic US also least vaccinated. makes sense consider they‚Äôre also lower risk older folks, though.    Shhhh don‚Äôt think far ahead. Sure wish betting market this. I'd bet quite large amount virus still quite prevalent similar effect society flu (but top existing flu) years time. I'm trying understand here... please, I'm facetious comment/question...

I given understand vaccination prevents infection. way article reads, appears instead, still easily infected less likely become sick? 

Is case?

I'm confused. pretty bad reaction vaccine (as part vaccine trial), kept myself. Sorry, try make sure spell least once. use abbreviation much work forget uncommon people. goal help keep spread low among unvaccinated

the goal overload hospitals/reduce deaths getting vaccinated. basically saying vaccinated babysit people dont believe covid, really?

And ask children cant get vaccinated? dont even need vaccs already safe looking data goverments germany/UK dont even advise taking vaccine simply wear mask public?

Nobody wants wear mask dont vaccinated dimwit. got vaccine horrible nerve issues unable play guitar long time. scared shit him.  point oxygen levels may low, top scared parts brain shutting down. Great reference. article ""Recent polls found Republicans White evangelicals least likely say they‚Äôll get shots,.."" I'm wondering improve vaccination rates.

Scary headlines disturbing photos? lot this, help.

Clear explanations, numbers facts? help either.

Canada vaccination rates blowing roof, Fauci said vaccination topic become politicized. countries topic already ""politicized""? Florida may businesses 'till CDC came foolishenss. Well put Largely of....ready this? Anti vaxxers! Hmm, weren‚Äôt fully vaccinated people protected hospitalization death according CDC? 60k cases day risk. 

You nothing types exhausting. Yes. part two shot study. surprising.  Short term good publicity? CDC seems staffed weak people don‚Äôt like tell people need here. I‚Äôve actually never seen government organization seems staffed weak willed people life. Perhaps never deal pandemic made scared overstepping what‚Äôs needed? know read article said 60s 70s CDC warned pandemic ended nothingburger ever since institution shy react absolutely anything. anybody believed ever truly, 100% protected getting infected spreading?

The virus still effective preventing infection spread, way effective single measure, never 100%. Um...the clear bad idea. 

When CDC made decision reversal many epidemiologists caught guard b/c said bad idea. 

""By standard, mask forever.""

Right 'cause we're totally gonna 60k cases day forever. 

""as population, explains everyone's masks came fast.""

Too many Americans selfish oversized children understand meaning shared sacrifice. Masks cause harm big deal. That's cool something like concussion. Weekends pre-covid still best time visit ER, lol. lay gurney hall broken leg, everytime doctor going get me, another car motorcycle accident come in. took hours! ask comment was? removeddit found looking for! see that. please understand far ""a piece fabric"" makes many us absolutely miserable. might well lockdown I'm going public places I'm required wear mask unless absolutely to. found looking Yep sentiments exactly. Could catch it? Yeah could. did, chances dying approaching 0. literally don‚Äôt care anymore.    get argument thats pretty selfish attitude considering actions effect everyone around you. ain‚Äôt republicans refusing Sooo many people think pandemic over. I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôm worried catching unvaccinated person. 40% state fully vaccinated yet walk grocery store, 50% aren‚Äôt wearing masks vaccinated would need worried? Many nursing homes privately owned profit. curious loved one dies due unvaccinated staff, would open possibility civil lawsuits companies. seems like sure fire way light fire companies ass mandate vaccination employment. literally saying media making stories one know died even gone hospital. 9000 deaths 6 million people state Half deaths nursing homes. people vaccinated. 78 percent adults. both. anti-vaccination mistaken belief can‚Äôt catch again. 

Doctors Arkansas started speaking covid/vaccination politicized Arkansas. governor‚Äôs office denies it. Lambda variant: ""Hold beer..."" assume normal distribution, correct. can't explain parents they're require vaccine shot. COVID December, recently tested antibodies. doctor told lot antibodies require shot.

But see news reports, Delta avoid antibodies, even corona half year ago, still need shot. 

Point parents ""we ain't get shot see difference antibodies vaccine ones"".

How could explain need vaccinate themselves? It‚Äôs uncommon vaccines therapeutic effects. reports MRNA vaccines alleviate long covid symptoms.  Pandemic dumb. good info, thank you.

Just wanted follow up: certain B.1.617 referred Delta? Technically Delta B.1.617.2, I‚Äôm shocked shortened they‚Äôre referring whole lineage (which would also include B.1.617.1 kappa B.1.617.3 don‚Äôt think named).

Thanks extra info! I'll admit I'm slow-brained idiot, stuff like makes even *me* wonder stupid people be. mean real. possible allegedly full grown adult brain, understand things even elementary school kids know? can't comprehend stupidity people. Probably reason want admit poll people make fun them. 70-75% total population least one dose.

20-25% 6 million people still unvaccinated leaves lot total people still get infected vs 20-25% 600,000 people.

It‚Äôs like LA- sure 60% vaccinated. means 4 million people still aren‚Äôt. please tell IOC collects penalty. courts, country, army demand payment.

I say would find funny watch world's reaction IOC tried sue Japanese government Japan wanting party enormous threat population world.

That's point they'd effectively turn cartoon supervillain organisation. Monday, town officials said July 1 July 16, 132 positive COVID-19 cases identified, ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù fully vaccinated people. Tuesday, number cases nearly doubled, Town Manager Alex Morse wrote Facebook post 1st amendment tells specifically right.

Now, heard Lord savior Satan? party never ends Lagging vaccination rates among nursing home staff linked national increase COVID-19 infections deaths senior facilities, center federal investigation hard-hit Colorado location disease detectives found many workers one memory care facility Grand Junction area, 16 fully vaccinated residents infected four died, according CDC slide provided Associated CDC investigated several nursing homes Mesa County experiencing new outbreaks. one location ‚Äî described ‚ÄúFacility A‚Äù ‚Äî 42% staff still fully vaccinated, contrasting 8% residents failed complete Nationally 59% nursing home staff gotten shots, overall percentage fully vaccinated adults ‚Äî significantly lower roughly 80% residents vaccinated, according Medicare. states much lower vaccination rates around 40%. could pretty much say supermarket, hospital, workplace etc... dont know different long wearing mask breathing others. Every machine use always spray anyway. Idiots idiots though curing stupid isnt really going thing lifetime is. 

What worry others gym, others supermarkets, others workplaces, hospitals, etc... Im worried I've places months (close year) dont covid. amazing taking precautions does. People manipulated thinking make decisions adults vaccinated? Since when? Already do! Taking vaccine help protect health health others way infringing human rights. 

And you‚Äôre exempt health considerations, you‚Äôre probably reconsidering career move become nurse too. bring children danger time. world going stop 1 100000 chance kid dying. He's way likely die thousand things.  Never like much, Except motherless children cocaine, may yard bird songs. Otherwise pretty boring.  confirmed oh initial feelings  she‚Äôs not. worked state, didn‚Äôt create site. Florida used dashboard everyone else used. input data.

Sad.  Like covid   news media trying kick panic today. time it‚Äôs **More breakthrough cases!!**

They show big scary red numbers screen, math, numbers incredibly favorable.

- 159,000,000 fully vaccinated Americans

- 5,492 hospitalized died (*Really, news media? Combining hospitalization death one figure? combine it? try make bigger scarier number?*)

- 5,492 159MM.. **0.003454088050314466%**

- 5,492, **75%** 65.

So really choosing take ‚Äúnews‚Äù small number breakthrough cases occur fully vaccinated people trying twist headline ‚ÄúrIsinG nuMbEr bREakThRough cAsEs!1‚Äù

Don‚Äôt listen it. Want protected COVID-19? **Get vaccinated!** Want protected breakthrough cases? **Get family/friends vaccinated.** best defense high vaccination rate community drives cases zero.  actually suffering J &amp; J vaccine makes effective single dose?

From everything understand, similar tech AZ vaccine, I've never able figure like getting first dose AZ. r/iamatotalpieceofshit finally felt ok enough stop masking work (I mostly work area alone limited contact others though night) something really work to, even fully vaxxed since April. Delta would gotten start masking anyway - really took seasonal allergies dust job.

What people? They're homicidal! know 2% accurate testing dropped vaccinated people going less like ask get tested. Truth know true numbers, early accurate data, new variables introduced continually.

The 2% reference people hospitalized, people community. hurts

They might actually get take slight mutations too. come along 1 leave 5. Everyone's winner! true Apocalympics.  saying conjecture something supported evidence? Data Israel showed Moderna significantly effective first dose. 

I opinion differences second dose enough data. theres lot people board either believe virus real we're lizard people want pandemic last forever never take masks always crowd limits. Sounds good, HOV. improve treatment plans reduce active cases time. Same. Fully vaccinated never really bothered wearing mask, anything like privacy aspects it. going maskless little felt somewhat freeing following mask guidelines year, coinciding case numbers dropping lowest they've area since start pandemic (live MN, county relatively lower case numbers) rise Delta I've masking indoor environments, there's literally downside would like continue trend cold catching Covid, given amount people pay absolutely regard ""wear mask unvaccinated"" policies.

[Especially consistently found damage brain who've (Based brain scans, self perception boot. imagined.)  We‚Äôre point anyone access tools need keep safe.

Right probably good idea keep tabs things aim keep around safe. Usually symptoms generally present within 14 days exposure, tests generally pretty easy.

You might also quarantine requirements imposed local government exposure (for instance, live, we're legally required quarantine 14 days receive notice contact received second dose).

Always good idea check doctor health practitioner advice (some areas lines nurses provide guidance well) - lot tele-sessions phone calls offer lot guidance specific AHJ without wait public queue. many locals, covered via insurance public health too.

Wishing best. terrifying. I've fully vaccinated months I'm super concerned covid God forbid us emergency need medical care. don‚Äôt agree view outcome good bad endings are. I‚Äôm finding strange paradox many people‚Äôs reasoning. one hand, people arguing that, due vaccine inequity, countries restrict borders, implement ‚Äúsuppressive measures,‚Äù add border restriction hurdles people entering country. would argue open world grants higher degree equity, general. someone cannot survive well place live, opportunity venture countries. furthermore, people able get vaccinated countries well. 

If want world equity, answer stricter borders additional hurdles free movement. fact, implementing policies exact opposite keeping privilege privilege. 

The good scenario one things open much possible, severe cases kept down. good scenario one world gets vaccinated. vaccines work. Unless hard evidence efficacy decreasing, posting mere hearsay. Test test shown mRNA vaccines 90%+ effective severe Covid symptoms infected. That‚Äôs amazing. lucky internet technologies enabled scientific triumph record pace. evolved humans since Spanish flu. didn‚Äôt massive database sharing, dna sequencing, forth. Put simply, it‚Äôs completely different ball game now. 

In short, it‚Äôs important countries places open quickly possible reduce restrictions burdens quickly possible. pandemic affected underprivileged people privileged, mostly endure hardships imposed upon form lockdowns forth. simply cannot financially withstand that. Masks never helped pandemic troll says so? OK bud. ever go ER 2020? I‚Äôm doubting COVID impacting situation places, it‚Äôs like could ever walk places get treated. waited hours horrible concussion.

Like, damn. existence now.  yet data (should next day two). seven-day period ending July 13, approximately 17% new cases LA County vaccinated individuals. 

For reference, roughly half 10 million residents LA County fully vaccinated.  care anyone says, current admin dropped ball nearly much last. mask policy nightmare opened everything prematurely.

Everyone know running around like reminds March 2020 one realized shit storm coming. I'm sick politics got us here. Get fucking vaccine wear mask get life. That's me, dawg. better analogy everything right driving car, there's 0.05% chance asshole still hit you

you wear seatbelt 100% time 0.05% chance Yeah... I've less opted that.   Something CDC can‚Äôt account need think considering area live. 

Are fully vaccinated? (2 weeks 2nd Pfizer Moderna shot. Or, 2 weeks J&amp;J shit.)

Are area high vaccination rate? (Like NE)

What‚Äôs covid positivity rate live? (Above 5%? I‚Äôd mask.)

Is covid raging wildfire live? (In Arkansas? Mask, limit time public indoors)

Do underlying health conditions? 60% US does. 

The US huge. Risk level varies widely state state. Besides, CDC release blanket statement saying it‚Äôs safe without mask. nuanced. heard wanted hear.  Covid aside, much sniffle since whole thing started honestly part mind masks all. Especially something dumb like grocery store. Well 90% effectiveness vaccines proves care‚Ä¶.  assume that‚Äôs easiest option get Houston pharmacy. don‚Äôt care long don‚Äôt get sick breathing wrong air. mask device protect OTHERS. YOU.  go mind business.   Praying basketball team dude  vaccines effective enough strains robust herd immunity effects. countries rapidly getting 70% vaccinated India plans get needed doses end year. There's hope turn pandemic localized endemic pathogen areas. effectively means over. virus mutate rapidly influenza.  back forth shit getting annoying. almost like trying make pandemic last forever.

This never unless mandate masks, stop events, test crossing state lines getting planes, setup quarantine areas like New Zealand done. FFS would take 45 days taking pandemic seriously would done it.

or spend next 10 years dealing variants booster shots whittle away 45+ population. I‚Äôve gotten vaccinated twice, I‚Äôve worn mask whole time, I‚Äôll continue foreseeable future, I‚Äôm immunocompromised. could still easily die get breakthrough covid infection. vaccines don‚Äôt work well people weakened immune systems, they‚Äôve acknowledged probably need give us extra booster shots, plans yet. 

There lot people like me. Older people, immunocompromised people, plain unlucky people, done everything right still dying getting critically ill. I‚Äôm saying wear mask everywhere (or anywhere don‚Äôt want to), it‚Äôs unvaccinated idiots risk. lot us best stay alive we‚Äôre vulnerable waiting herd immunity that‚Äôs probably going come. sucks. So, mad fight pain? Pfizer 

Is particular reason like Pfizer vs Moderna booster? curious. China: *Surprised Pikachu face* Everyone someone important someone else. Whether agree not, would want children, friends, spouses, parents, significant others treated compassion. 

""Above all, love deeply, love covers multitude sins."" - @sshole Literally, like bad movie predict ending. Anyone surprised isn‚Äôt paying attention. seems like misleading title.
Perhaps attended gathering kids tow, unmasked. 
It explicitly say husband transmitted virus children.  Look Germany said officially mixing doses agree! üëçüèΩ‚ú®üôèüèΩ  Yeah straps really hurting back ears while. still feel safer on.   still catch masked well, best caring thing community would stay fuck home   mask isnt protection though?

Edit: I'm saying meant protect others. husband's several friends flew US get entire family vaccinated. boggles mind Americans still wont get jab. Stupidity purest form.  I'm confident will. argument whole essential worker debate. exposure sites already spread regional NSW think seen numbers whilst virus still incubation period. 

I hope right, I'm optimistic. long eat deviled eggs, don‚Äôt care I'm 41 long hauler.

Fuck Covid hard =/ 

I'm vaccinated, course, it'd luck get case Delta top long covid possible die delta even fully vaccinated?  visited LA. Indoor Restaurants packed - masks course. People want return normal taking precautions before. Either don‚Äôt choose to, simply can‚Äôt. Expect see continued increase cases hospitalizations. Exponential growth silent ‚ÄúUS hits 200,000 cases day‚Ä¶again‚Äù That's long epidemiological debate quite time. problem good ways pinpoint given infection due surface contact inhaled. CDC recently stated stop wiping shipping boxes transmission due surface contact primary mode transmission, back evidence. looks like another one brash recommendations they've decided like masks effective (stop hoarding), oh mandate them, they're needed vaccinated (even delta variant increasing circulation vaccines 70-80% effective against) spurring everyone drop masks. fact matter science settled. science shows half life surfaces 2 days. aerosolization infected surfaces enclosed spaces. That's evidence shows.  too, wild interesting ride. never experienced anything like life. felt odd.  Get N95 similar masks. Wear face shield well. call sick.

Can yo get rapid tests are? Exact same. Everyone staring me. crazy quickly normalcy seeing person wearing mask fading away  don't, opinion. people seem made hypochondriac entire Identity days media loves pump clickbait stories help validate anxiety. science says vaccinated people end hospital die it, can't get infected. Every day hear stories vaccinated people getting it. spreading like wildfire right continue awhile. I'm wearing mask indoors time I'm house. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. Still mask. Still limit time public indoor spaces. Why? I‚Äôm asthmatic. One main treatments asthma inhaled corticosteroid. ICS put greater risk respiratory infections. 

Low risk isn‚Äôt zero risk. 

Delta 1,000 times viral load original virus. (Could risk higher currently believed?)

There isn‚Äôt enough data know vaccinated individuals still risk long covid. 

Also, 12 aren‚Äôt yet eligible vaccination. Anyone compromised immune system heightened risk. Check four weeks. We'll control go again! anyone else numb type news yet?  realising bulk hosplitalizations death party delta doesnt take prisoners?

Its gonna Lord flies fall. thought Jack, turns probably going face outcome Piggy did. 90%. Wow. Thanks pointing date this. people commenting means letting people die COVID, let's hear strategies fixing COVID crisis still allowing people still feel sense normalcy. Read headline? headline cherry picked quote clicks? realize 2021 right? people trust FB friends doctor? might disrupt carefully built cognitive biases, all.

But seriously, sad. Beyond sad. Sad even describe collective unwillingness parse information ourselves, collective distrust institutions we're supposed trust, collective ignorance science fact.  would explain j&amp;j vaccine us looking effective moderna Pfizer, since j&amp;j traditional/dead/low dose virus (I honestly remember know mRNA one like moderna Pfizer). hehe, saying illogical. there's covid present can't test effectiveness vaccine. 

This study found ""relative likelihood"" getting covid double vaxxed pfizer less 1%. reason adjusted figure around 12%. 

I'm wondering why, one seems know hehe. Yes. They're realizing voters dying wanting go polls bad thing. completely selfish reasons. hey - gets people get vaccinated I'm it. true. Vaccinating people would reduce *spread* variants though would still helpful. work Nola live Houma, we‚Äôre freaking 30% vaxed. wife good, mostly everyone else close me‚Äîexcept 8 year old son.

Wearing mask really makes miserable? You‚Äôd think that‚Ä¶ Exactly fuck masks introverted weirdos. aren‚Äôt vaccinated fucking problem mine shit. Vaccinated people immune variants. immuno-compromised certain comorbidities tough time regardless vaccine isn‚Äôt 100%. Yep. Infection =/= disease. R/thathappened vaccines provide 100% guaranteed barrier infection every person.

True. point J&amp;J true vaccine kind know about, compare similarity flu vaccine, doctors know age immune response plays part got good level protection not. further, mRNA dosed bodies, quite different mechanism action, type chain reaction needed body make protection, much protects individually dependent well. makes mRNA different one yet knows much help still sticking around 6mos, 7mos, on. real human trials mark right now.  Desantis worship Florida real. even much red tide issue going either. think laws mandates say all. Actually, yes, vaccines offer sterilizing immunity. Herd immunity occurs one individual vaccination time. Moron parties Hand washing, lol?

In fact, even see comments here. two completely opposite interpretations quotes thanks taken context actual sentences truncated.


I think real root issue he's used talking lawyers PHDs actually take *exactly* says *and order says in* account. 

Applying method communicating amounts public statement average layperson results people able take 'qualifying' (clarifying) statements context. 

That combined *very* careful wording he's using try get message across without causing panic undermining trust organizations means LOT qualifying statements. reality getting different results: less people getting severely ill less people dying. Less death severe illness always goal, getting rid COVID. Disrespectful sure, western world can't ignore obesity problem effects health much longer. I‚Äôm 100% ok DeSantis, year half late change stances now. fact, saying going dick-diddly changing people's minds since conspiracy theories already drilled people's brains. one else blame cases people rode crazy train you. I'm not. I'm saying based results double vaxxed pfizer group less 1% contracted covid. would number different real world; long sample size large enough reflect general population, seems here. 

So would expect among doubly vaxxed people real world less 1% would contract delta. results suggest 12% will. know, caught earlier properly ashamed. I‚Äôm mobile! Someone please explain even debate?

Those refuse get vaccinated going swayed mask wearing policy.

Trying convince vaccinated Americas start wearing mask completely counters message returning normal life vaccinated gives fuel anti-vaxers.

Vaccinated Americans going back mask wearing. going happen. gotta love utter lack distancing picture. risk death 20-40 crowd somewhere BASE jumping mountaineering Himalayas. 20 like driving 7500 miles car. understand difficult get younger people vaccinated, despite access simple solution.

With way people drive nowadays 7500 miles seems daunting me. would always dread driving home work 2-3 am. Now, distracted driving way scares early morning driving.   must make doctors employed people general really hate job huh prepare mean stock pile beer, meat, prepared grill? ;)

Everyone else primarily planning hurrication sliver needing flee.  know people party looks like stop signs get lambasted pretty regularly sub, personally find change messaging really encouraging. week alone Scalise, Hannity, DeSantis/Rubio come swinging get vaxxed. popular names within party hopefully combined increase bad outcomes seeing unvaccinated areas encourage folks side aisle get shots. point tell unvaccinated people, chance, listen, go home die. responsible patients treat.

Obviously, that's unethical. 

But point, would apply COVID/Vaccinations? fat person also going receive treatment? guy waited 52 get prostate exam instead 50 cancer? Yeah, lot old frail people probably risk succumbing common Cold point. also vaccinated six months anti bodies might waned bit much. People really can't wrap heads around fact people die every day.

What legal strategies US arsenal that's going force people get vaccinated? vaccines FDA approved, what's next step? Exactly. I'm tired constantly getting downvoted mentioning kids can't vaccinated, getting comments saying really risk. insulated past year +, loosening restrictions Vaccinated. Masks social distancing mean lower viral loads get it. really worry upcoming School year places like mine require masks Schools loosened social distancing requirements half since last year. Youtube ban like President Trump spreading misinformation. Time stop playing cat mouse misinformation completely ban anyone so. definitely false sense security. live north east US state/area high number vaccinated people. Barely anyone wearing masks little social distancing. Vaccinated still pass virus along right?  Plenty vaccinated people still getting covid here. Someone realized he's losing voters far generally (and say generally immunology nothing absolute) relegated got COVID unvaccinated. Generally, serious COVID effects vaccinated people exception, rule. They're much smaller company manufacturing expertise Pfizer anyone confirm unvaccinated people? Ad Hominem, logical fallacy. misleading.

Lol  rational countries US, people understand mass death critical illness bad outcomes avoided Sure, ones died hospice care, likely going die real soon without Covid. saying adult vaccinations take priority. US different problem world, hence different recommendations CDC. vaccinated almost every adult wants get vaccinated plenty vaccine. gift vaccine needy countries, like India, since literally wasting vaccine. sure overproduce child doses too, come winter--plenty parents refuse vaccinate children. thank you. immune systems need fight bacteria viruses. needs practice effective. Living sterilized world ravage immune systems. Yes, delta weren‚Äôt virulent, difference would minor. delta, case rates pretty low, one‚Äôs chances actually exposed also low. But...

The chief purpose vaccination reach herd immunity would twin protections efficacy vaccine low odds encountering virus first place. delta surging much is, many unvaccinated individuals still ready infected, likelihood exposure probably soon become near-certainty, effectively nullifying part vaccine‚Äôs protection. breakthrough case rate 1 10 still going lot people. Using additional protective measures (masks, avoiding crowds, etc.) makes sense. Pfizer came first US, simply data people around 6mos out, whereas Moderna 3-4mos out. Think Pfizer data whole month two ahead, also maybe reaching point need 6mo booster. look Isreal, one early ones catching India's delta variant, getting Pfizer bit Americans first responders it. vaccinated IMF catching it, well nursing homes, full vaccinated data spelled alarms Pfizer breakthroughs, estimated 64% new efficacy Pfizer near clinical trial situtaions everyone dosed up.

All said, know plenty Moderna J&amp;J breakthroughs, think anyone really talking comparing cases news yet. Here's do. Anyone vaccinated choice gets placed bottom priority queue first ones get turned away COVID issues. Society pay anti-vaxxers choice take preventative measures. Sadly southern US, even it. still can't seem make connection. chalk ""Well, time go."" force lifestyle others. got j&amp;j months ago initially refused go massless indoors (including eating) people opportunity vaccinate. 

Now seems like people get vaccine have, necessary wear mask indoors health go back attending parties, going dinners, etc? 3 new variants im doctor variants already better (even slightly) evading existing vaccine antibodies original covid, think possibility exists could eventually mutate something unrecognizable vaccine antibodies. would still technically virus though, it? can‚Äôt confirm remember reading report saying around 66-75% effective Delta. whole reddit like past couple days. isn‚Äôt though, follow sub closely. LA largely vaccinated though. Cases matter much rise highly vaccinated populations people symptomatic. good piece read yesterday, written doctor infectious diseases people vaccinated symptoms could extend pandemic forever. That‚Äôs PCR test, still remains gold standard testing (over antigen-based testing), detect virus particles ‚Äî even one. small amounts virus enough cause transmission, according studies Journal Infectious Diseases Lancet.

I've always found principle reason behind conspiracy theory nonsense ego. Believing conspiracy theory enables demonstrate intellectual superiority hapless blind masses believe lies given evil forces ""they"". 

But smart fall that...

and thus COVID-19 vaccine hoax... Next time, people wait paid vaccine, fewer die, you. term ""hypothetical"" actually called ""planning"". cost freedom meaningless death, guess. *shrugs* Seems like it. Scotland peaked last week.

If so, validates opening hospitalizations/deaths small fraction past surges (still sucks one people though). makes hopeful US complete shitshow outside low vax areas. HCMC encountering shortages 10,000 pigs, 400,000 eggs 1,500 tons fresh vegetables day, according agriculture ministry.

Going forward, city prepared several scenarios following 15-day social distancing order imposed since July 9. appropriate option would continue social distancing measures, even ramping certain areas, according Phan Van Mai, deputy secretary HCMC Party Standing Committee. 
 
Stricter social distancing another 7-10 days would help curb transmissions city infection count could peak, said. 
 
The ongoing social distancing order HCMC, issued Directive 16, requires residents stay home go basic necessities buying food medicines, work factories businesses allowed open. 
 
People must stay least two meters other. two people gather public places apart workplaces, schools hospitals. agree. fair vaccinated teachers either. vaccinated, CDC says safe go without masks. decision scientifically based. based wanting deal teaching kids bully kids, supposed part job educator. great. almost benefit vaccinated people masking up. problem guidance, enforcement guidance.

That's like comparing covid common cold, since coronavirus family (well, common colds anyway). disingenuous, clearly stated multiple people already, Moderna Pfizer nearly identical (which CureVac not), every study far, including testing Delta, Moderna even better. Moderna essentially bigger Pfizer dose. That's reasonable assume nearly identical efficacy rates, they're nearly identical vaccines. wear mask? done job economy got Pfizer vaccines. people unvaccinated ones wear mask.  also lots people live one state work another.

The vaccine absolutely nothing exposure. 0% effective that. original varients moderna reduced cases 66% Delta would even lower basically least effective preventing technical case. makes sense someone get virus system test positive fully get rid it. there's effectiveness based least one symptom effective though less effective Delta varient. really holds effective hospitalizations deaths.

The number people who've negative reactions vaccines incredibly minuscule compared number people died Covid. case vaccine *give* Covid. may feel flu-like symptoms day immune system supposed to. alternative immune system trying fight virus, guarantee lot worse. asshole? old coworker mine passed away. fairly close one brief point lives. lot friends still worked coworker. person funny , kind asshole, smart, also dumb , good father, also asshole husband (I objective evidence sentiments). helpful. willing throw people bus protect himself.

There absolutely reports people catching covid two times. getting vaccine merely rolling dice, akin russian roulette. Asymptomatic spread happen. 

""Incredibly unlikely"" really vague, vaccinated people found around 70% less likely contract virus, 60% less likely spread infected.  
No idea combine numbers, guess would mean infected vaccinated person 12% likely spread vaccinated person, non-vaccinated spread non-vaccinated. 

From PHE data, estimated vaccinated person infected 30% likely hospitalized non-vaccinated person 

Which would bring risk infected vaccinated person hospitalizing another vaccinated person around 3.6% chance infected non-vaccinated person hospitalizing non-vaccinated person.

Sort like... vit levels high June low Dec might confound protection rates... vaccine combined vit levels may effective vit levels low (but since vit levels vaxxed unvaxxed, group comparison gets rid confounding variables).

Answer question tho, **what would take put big boy pants follow restrictions?** 

 
For clarification since probably need it: I'm talking *right now*. I'm asking bad would things need get think yourself, ""Hm, maybe masks distancing bad idea"". would thought appear spectrum 'things tad worse' 'bodies piling streets'? got Pfizer boost last week getting J&amp;J March? see lots people recommending single booster many commenting whether people go ahead get full course mRNA vaccine booster. automatically made second appointment pharmacy I'm sure whether take it.  I'm sure Singapore UK, Canadian study, efficacy pfizer vaccine delta variant reported symptomatic infection seems Israel study article reporting efficiency overall infection (both asymptomatic symptomatic), though I'm 100% certain. seem like apples apples comparison Israel Canadian study think earned it,‚Äù Commissioner Cindy Garber said. ‚ÄúI work really hard job. in-person crazy year.‚Äù

Great. front line workers get grift deaths 600,000 Americans? late   Yup. Got first one today, second one scheduled middle October. meant percentage currently eligible. everyone 12 years age America, extremely small percentage cannot take vaccine medical reasons, fortunately.  Looks like DeSantis needs banned classic entitlement syndrome. Reality rarely deals absolutes. Wearing mask provide level protection, even lower others around wearing masks. certainly zero. Q-variant.  UK almost 90% adults 1+ dose they‚Äôre still massive spike. I‚Äôm convinced herd immunity really within reach think it‚Äôs less profit freedom. degree constitution limits deemed required illegal. I‚Äôm sure masks fall exactly, cannot legally asked produce papers vaccination. countries might language place. would imagine 43 vaccinated deaths unique many ways, bet one reasons low levels neutralizing antibodies (either getting one shot, weakened immune system like transplant patients immunosuppressants). 

Obviously age overall health may play role well.  That's outlier among data sets Well, 100% impossible, get point pretty much breakthrough cases, said cases FAR fewer number, vast majority mild asymptomatic. hire nihilist philosophers matter, would. Citation needed? 


Where evidence vaccination offers superior durable immune protection natural infection? 


That certainly can't true cases, least... turn pretend thought cell phone gun Another issue might moving US January-February 2022 study neither CanSino AztraSeneca FDA‚Äôs eua status, fear need take another vaccine enter there.

The US CDC's guidance people fully vaccinated vaccine listed emergency use need revaccination.

See ""People vaccinated outside United States"" in:   ""put seatbelt please"" whisper EMT scrapes disfigured body highway. feel you, people nuts I‚Äôm surprised haven‚Äôt heard studies moderna delta variant. Meanwhile 18-49's process vaccinated. Last 40+ group getting second jabs moment, 30's 1 jab waiting second 30's getting first doses now. age registration cohorts match cohorts website stats pulled skews 18-24 25-49 fully vaxxed stats. ie. Gen. Pop. 18-24yo ireland starting get first doses week. 25% fully vaxxed stat cohort mostly made immuno-compromised, risky pre-existing conditions healthcare workers age group vaccinated early. percentage fully vaccinated 25-49yo cohort 46% dragged yet vaccinated 25-30yo single dose vaccinated 30-40yo. 40-49 cohort pretty much done stage stats 40-49 specifically.

I imagine vaccine uptake drop one goes age cohorts massive degree. imagine 18-25 25-49 still end 85% fully vaccinated area. Sounds like Jim Crow me

Only understand Jim Crow was.  young healthy I'd consider it. Efficacy drops older unhealthier are.  I‚Äôm you, raw case number isn‚Äôt nearly concerning used be, it‚Äôs statement essentially anywhere see spread. I, too, like ask parachute I've already jumped plane.  Dying ""other team"" sacrifice happy make! people could get vaccinated? Numbers like really mean nothing without knowledge population size.

It‚Äôs also pretty hot debate underreporting thing, people would contend fair amount reported deaths due causes. That's weird. vaccine first rolled months ago, thought groups got preferential treatment.  better person I, Genghis.  incredible victory. Back started Covid entered nursing home, wouldn‚Äôt entirely inaccurate imagine grim reaper going room room- saw cases 50% patients care home would die. We‚Äôre far, far better place ever could dream vaccines. know they're mentioned study wrong assume Moderna vaccine holds well Pfizer vaccine? Vaccine hesitancy low rates vaccination among black Hispanic communities caused different reasons white communities.

""The"" anti-vax movement one thing, that's article seems about. Lack access information healthcare another thing entirely. forget distrust medical system caused decades unethical experimentation done minority communities another. Ever hear Tuskegee syphilis study? Exactly this. Even mild don‚Äôt want children sick form. willing take risks hope best always get supposed miracle vaccine later.

Imagine deserted island, starving, someone offers least favorite food. eat it, wait someone offer tastier meal, potentially risking starving death waiting?  took like 10-12 hours I'm hearing lot conflicting info delta variety efficacy vaccines. Last heard 60% Pfizer. Hospitalizations deaths. Deaths lag hospitalizations 1-2 weeks. *Surprised Pikachu Face* FUCK DELTA FLY AMERICAN.

Remember that. quite bit past time. people getting vaccinated today hit full immunity disease gets them. lines antivax single vaccine came recently. universally antivax. Yes majority Covid deaths since pandemic started would Alpha since Delta new strain Alpha‚Äôs since late 2019. Yes arrive conclusions vaccine efficacy related Delta. vaccinated people catching Delta higher rates? getting hospitalized dying? difficult data come by.   Redditors long history feeling superior point wishing suffering people disagree them. subreddit especially good it. stupid fuck. Actually suggest anything all, made point point making. 


You're one apoplectic meltdown thought needing wear piece fabric face public longer. I‚Äôm sure anyone cares tested negative covid three times think I‚Äôm clear. Get tested cvs. Results less 24 hours. easy hell. can‚Äôt exactly blame India wanting starve citizens contain this. Infection control genuinely need meet economic demands- core principle public health. single mask sight. stop testing get better vaccine comes out. now, use one get. close doors you.   Yes. story changed last year. US large. many cultures here, based selfishness fear. tend cluster geographically. CA effectively doesn‚Äôt use it, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs barrier. Ok. 

If half people refuse get vaccinated - percentage half vaccinated, would require medical intervention higher rate vaccinated; STILL overwhelm hospitals various areas. acceptable myriad reasons obvious.

Beyond that, vaccinated, part clinically defined ""mild"" infections breakthrough occurs; also shed demonstrably less virus. would help control spread. may perhaps save someone else's life...

I'm going honest here. know confusing, know read chart posting.

It lists:

COVID RELATED DEATHS.

PNEUMONIA RELATED DEATHS

PNEUMONIA + COVID RELATED DEATHS

PNEUMONIA COVID INFLUENZA RELATED DEATHS.

You focusing pneumonia column, data important people studying this, show people tracking pneumonia separately track trends. 

Not everyone COVID dies due pneumonia. People die due influenza, people die due COVID itself. die symptoms caused by, exacerbated illness.

People health heart heart attack due severity illness Vascular Respiratory. 

The COVID column COVID deaths. COVID + Pneumonia Column informs 598,000 people died COVID, 294,000 also developed pneumonia primary cause death. would inform 50% get COVID die pneumonia, rest die causes.

That said 

http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths

Going full circle back 300k deaths unaccounted for. 

241,000 pneumonia deaths also higher expected year. Like stated.

Prior COVID per capita Pneumonia related deaths 14.9 per 100,000. America means roughly, pneumonia related deaths 50k people die.

That means 240k, 190k unaccounted for.

Furthermore due masking flu deaths well, primary cause pneumonia.

I'm sure see going.

REGARDLESS end day, COVID deaths closer 900k 600k(Though even higher now, 630k deaths officially, official number probably 1 million now).

The pneumonia related deaths relatively high attributed COVID.

Seriously... Please read charts closely going forward. I‚Äôll bet Rand Paul yell Dr Fauci  There's much information article would indicate Gamma variant going hold Delta variant next weeks. way sure track case numbers variant see way they're trending.

My work requires knowledgeable COVID trends, want know personal reasons.

For example, 1000 vaccinated people 4 unvaccinated people total 2 group get infected 50% infections vaccinated people. 2/1000 vaccinated people got sick 2/4 unvaccinated people got sick. 

If you‚Äôre vaccinated delta variant big deal. 

We stop testing symptomatic people. Germany highest population Europe

Russia? india Brazil really high death tolls?  Vaccination providing 50-60% protection Delta variant according best information available.

Not really. cherrypicking data makes vaccine look worst. Israeli data much outlier. Data England, Canada, Scotland line 75%+ efficacy infection, ~90% efficacy symptomatic disease. top that, data actually published along methodology, done Israeli data.

Yet another example vaccines work. information read lately, [like Nature suggest antibodies production due infection remains 11 months, one caveat find might effective towards covid variants vaccines (which reason people getting reinfected several times).

Mask people. virus care vaccinated. going infect everyone possibly that's chances mutate. wish people would stop whole seatbelt analogy/comparison. makes sound like want masks permanent thing like seatbelts. *very* similar. use sequence, different formulation nanoparticle. pick bill stay hospital instead everyone else pay choice. like delta much better reproducing, means need mightier immune response people (vaccinated not) simply can't execute also means viral loads shed higher.

This true. concrete numbers help us understand magnitude here. 

[Effectiveness Covid-19 Vaccines B.1.617.2 (Delta) BNT162b2 (Pfizer) vaccine, effectiveness two doses 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 95.3) among persons alpha variant 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 90.1) among delta variant.

So vaccine 93% effective 88% effective.

I got covid never got sick. Empathy required many - live firmly anti-vax household members, poverty domestic abuse, can't easily get vaccinated hosts wishes.

Plus every uneducated person bigot, truly afraid vaccines covid, due aggressive disinformation campaigns. Stupidity alone death sentence. Ffs guy lol also still largely mandatory country. Vaccininated not. Thanks. got Moderna vaccine. current CDC guidelines cover that: unvaccinated people wear masks (most places) inside. Requiring fully vaccinated people wear masks well another reason get vaccinated. 

And I'm talking . . . going indoor restaurants I'm *usually* wearing mask public indoor places. I'm delusion wearing mask indoors reducing virus spread; virus, I'm likely get virus, I'm even less likely spreading virus. 

At point, really ask tough questions. even want reduce spread virus now? even accomplishing environment vaccines used expiring? 

If think bad now, ain't seen nothing. two possibilities winter: either Delta variant dominant something *even more* easily transmissible. imagine going 2020 holiday season Delta variant? year, vaccinated population barrier transmission certain extent (vs 2020), still going bad lot places. Every person gets virus person probably get December January. starting see ""experts"" come around idea everyone going get sooner later. 

If start get data children 12 higher risk think, see changing strategy, see now, CDC public health officials seem fine letting virus run rampant unvaccinated community . . . sooner later. Heck yeah.  know rushed right in.  track record good.  need waste benefit doubt case. 95 n95 stands 95%  99% protection 99% protection, regardless happened control group.

Using logic test island covid present vaccine would offer 100% protection, super interesting figure.

sorry masks coming back gonna get it. They're needed. Stop helping anti-vaxxers. need mandate vaccine period get program implementing vaccination passport. think less duration by, ""will around people, particularly indoors?"" That's mask up.

But like you, thought masking upsets people visible symbol pandemic. also like said, COVID seems sticking around bit, counterproductive pretend gone. Unfortunately sort nuggets hope stuck brains apply Delta. Even, ""Kids unaffected"" still around, hope true already ten year old boy die town positive last week hospitalized (official death cause determined time). hope kids still largely safe variant Alpha. 

I still can't believe weeks ago thought vaccinated people likely going spread know several people today fully vaccinated positive. okay awesome means kids next question. scared. say wrong thing...we know happen.

I think masking upsets people it‚Äôs obvious symbol things aren‚Äôt normal desperate move on. Covid seems pretty comfortable we‚Äôll deal it. Lol nah reddit, conclusions rushed. Jokes you. never stopped wearing mask even got vaccinated. I've already made determination I'll wear mask rest life.

This issue mitigated effectively USA right now. truth USA among heavily vaccinated nations Earth. adults vaccinated. Abroad mot places, vaccines remain rare vast majority population unvaccinated, many received far less effective vaccines.

That means vaccinating unvaccinated US positive locally, much curb development variants globally many people remain unvaccinated less protected. change inoculate much larger share world's population.

Like must literally think vaccine supposed create magic shell around makes viruses bounce off.  breakthrough case opportunity COVID learn mutate around vaccine

You're wrong, mRNA vaccines like Pfizer concerned, I'm sure even possible Covid mutate way around them.

My understanding Coronavirus spike protein acts like key allows latch onto cells body hijack them, reproduces. mRNA vaccines, hand, instructions using messenger RNA (hence name) able regular vaccines can't, specifically tell white blood cells target cells exact spike protein. order Covid cell mutate around that, would either change spike protein lose altogether, mean issue resolves virus longer skeleton key let first place.

TL;DR: order Covid mutate around mRNA vaccines, would either become entirely different virus lock bodies altogether.

Edit: Someone feel free correct I'm understanding wrong Get Brita pitcher filter. filters cheap last months! immune system works. vaccine put physical barrier nose. viral anitgens still enter body try replcate. immune system, either circulating IgG antibodies B memory cells producing antibodies mount response kill virus chance replicate sufficiently exhibit symptoms.

Now consider various people different strength immune systems, compromised others. Also, different people produce different antibody titer levels response vaccine (seroconversion). clear 95% protection (and much lower delta variant) vaccinated people still exhibit viral shedding (being contagious). That‚Äôs mask mandate idiotic. bet 90% non-household transmission comes restaurants bars.  Im sorry hear that. doing? Oh, know well 10 minutes chat /s 
 political affiliation again? write without bot removing insult? :)  think misunderstood doctor, saying vaccine cure cannot help now. 
They trying help breathe survive.
If survive ordeal natural defense covid. 

But vaccine cure, instruction body give tools recognize invasive dangerous virus. 

If body full battle mode, virus already overwhelming body. defenses already knows virus. recognize it. 

A vaccine works showing body virus, different ways so. Often slightly changed virus used instruct body defenses updated recognize enemy. virus used vaccines made weaker way less dangerous.


But give body vaccine already trying handle invading virus.It like telling good soldiers enemy allowing country overwhelmed already. Like take class enemy flag middle fighting them.
The class completely useless 
extremely bad timing effort could cost war.

So giving people serious trouble viral infection vaccine terrible idea. 
It could make way worse effect all.

All doc assist oxygen, supportive medication care. 

So telling ‚Äúthis you‚Äù explaining patient happening limitations done. covid Incredible.

So you‚Äôll say confidently don‚Äôt trust CDC Guidance based science?

If sure Coronavirus originate them, problem let anyone investigate.   Depends age group look guess  virus can't see immune system work overcome it, brain. makes random mistakes replicating RNA happens land one allows spread better, spreads better usually doesn't. Less replicating RNA means less mistakes means less variants and. vaccinating people means virus spends less time body replicates RNA less leading lower chances variants forming.

Interesting AZ higher PVI inactivated vaccine (Covaxin).

On side note though, news 600 600k HCW Thailand caught covid 2 doses Sinovac, PVI rate 0.1% vs 5% reported here, somehow used paint Sinovac ineffective... transmissable virus also means likely develope another immuno-escape variant. Main takeaway confidence existing vaccines effective. even so, risks still getting sick even fatal, lead spreading fatalities unvaccinated. Masks would dampen that.

I would agree continued measures actual worldwide plan eliminate virus. hope understand would mean. would mean lock-downs similar Australia tracking similar China across entire planet, forced vaccinations worldwide, effort go animals spreading virus level humanity never done before.

That's going happen. Like virus endemic.  Yeah fuck CDC, put politics protecting children. people genuinely belligerent abusive.

By standard, mask forever.

That's 100% legitimate position, disagree it, population, explains everyone's masks came fast.

I think CDC's position totally tenable. 

If going mandate anything, vaccines. (At least order work shared office, go school, go restaurant, etc.). Let guess, another dose? cases last 1-2 days people worse. I've seen unlucky people week.

Ministry Health (VWS) appealing recent court ruling Open Government Act (Wob). judge ruled ministry's modus operandi coronapandemic accordance law.

Arnout le Clercq21 July 2021, 22:16

Wob requests must considered individually, court ruled end June. so, court overruled ministry's crisis working method. penalty fine, ministry must comply Wob requests quickly (within months).

In letter House Representatives, however, outgoing minister De Jonge writes court's ruling ""not enforceable. ministry also intention fundamentally changing working methods. ministry appeal, De Jonge goes majority Parliament previously determined must comply court ruling.

Professor Constitutional Administrative Law Wim Voermans (Leiden University) finds 'remarkable'. 'Actually minister saying ruling: we're going this.' According Voermans, typical 'resistance attitude' government towards Wob. 'But service, civil right.'

Since outbreak corona crisis, ministry adopted new way dealing Wob. law normally enables citizens request documents government. practice, journalists particular make use Wob. crisis would time deal Wob requests individually. De Jonge put parliamentary debate April 2020: 'I'm going ask fire department get behind computer. want fire department putting fires.

Portions, chosen ministry, corona policy information instead made public while. 'A traditional approach would result requested information made public later fragmented way,' De Jonge defends policy Parliamentary letter.

Waiting year
The judge ruled otherwise. According law, Wob requests must handled answered individually. alternative method used ministry meet requirement. current affairs programme Nieuwsuur, among others, brought case editors waiting year Wob request granted. De Volkskrant also recently went court Wob request outstanding.

In letter, De Jonge states workload 200 Wob requests currently processed Ministry great. Five million documents collected, two million remain ""cleansing"". still assessed content. Ministry able meet two-month deadline imposed judge. penalty payment ignores 'the great efforts' made, according De Jonge.

'They done nothing year half,' says Voermans. 'This overdue maintenance.' government trying shift problem submitters Wob: saddling ministry extra work, minister's thought. intention, says Voermans. Suppose go library want Hermans' Never sleep again. librarian say: 'But know many books have? Journalists' questions dealt with.'

At moment thirty lawyers working Wob requests. coming period, fifty lawyers must recruited job. technical briefing, senior official said goal eventually 'harass' journalists submitted Wob information. known September exactly happen. appeal, issue 'could last years' Voermans estimates. 'I call sabotage law.'

Additionally, people immuno-compromised otherwise generate good immune response vaccine, another dose fix that. people depend herd immunity squash spread virus. That's rather significant portion population getting vaccinated concerning. 

Source: Ph.D. virologist used Disneyland pass started complaining able reopen peak cases   Remember people subreddit quick downvote anyone said bad idea, masking continue? Fox News enormously popular among conservatives. 

Conservative states overwhelmingly behind vaccine rates. 

While can't really proved direct connection, definitely factual conservatives far likely refuse vaccine US Like said, think anybody decides feel secure mask go ahead wear it. don‚Äôt think anything see anybody wear mask. 

Personally state I‚Äôve noticed positive mood increase amongst people since us stopped wearing mask. QOL noticeably changed. boot, since took vaccinations seriously hospitalizations dropped near nothing even without us wearing mask months now, feel pretty good it.  Black communities dismal vaccination rates well. CDC said need masks anymore? ashamed, friend, done right thing still taking precautions people are. Might good idea make now, especially somewhere vaccination rates decent. knows winter bring! seems CDC found COVID-19 infection rate 30% among **vaccinated** residents staff facility, residents accounting vast majority cases.

They're saying every hundred vaccinated residents staff facility, 30 covid infection? Ah, yes evil white people.

Damn Reddit racist hell. UK released great study mRNA vaccine efficacy delta. Great read. Again, watch whole video. even gain politically this? know rude, I'll assume passion thing ignore it.

My county reached 70% fully vaccinated month ago, think even better flu vaccination rate (and much effective vaccine). Read NPR risk serious complication comparable flu, young children.

MIT technology review says data unclear. Another suggests 0-27% children (echoing ""unclear"" sentiment) least one symptom 6 months. That's small percentage develop illness all. 

If reliable/peer-reviewed data contrary, I'd happy take look. mean vaccine available every adult American. Nearly everyone could vaccinated choose often horse shit ingest conservative media social media. 

I think CDC handled perfectly Biden admin, main cause spike anti-vax morons... need wear permeable sock face? thanks Agree. Mandate masks kids go back normal.  Wow, well-measured response call fuckboi wearing mask fully-vaccinated. expected read right now.  America that‚Äôs bridge far us. think it‚Äôs liberal left conservative right could agree on. similar bad cold regular flu. difference totally lost sense smell. mean zero ability smell anything. I'm able smell again. Arkansas state law banning mask mandates. state legislature got panties twist last year republican governor ordered one. limiting, fact impacts life even less worry less. big deal :) 

i've noticed lot redditors equate masking ""big deal"" really relieves stress. two different types people suppose. Indian style.  perfect, thank much, good deed day county public health website may track share information. example, [Seattle/King County, multiple ways sorting data, click Zip Code left dropdown, toggle first dose full vaccination using second dropdown.

It‚Äôs interesting see vaccine coverage varies pretty damn significantly one zip code next.  4 family members get delta variant week vaccinations. ok won‚Äôt die still tired sick Problem people hung numbers massage data say want.  test use.  ignoring stuff stamp federally sponsored kickback death certificate .  aunt organ problems happy slap covid stamp cash.   really stopped. one bbq get-together indoors 4th July vaxxed, two not, everyone went home safe well. numbers community got low enough, went regular liquor store mask one time chatted guy owns minute, us maskless first time year. 

Then Delta started creeping state keep news virus hearing India starting thoroughly vaxxed Israel, back mask went. bother makes feel pretty good two Modernas N95 I'm pretty damn well protected I'm surrounded strangers, vaccinated county even 40% vaxxed. I've looking work state complete negligence stubbornness vaccination region country looking areas people little smarter. go anywhere particular find that, behavior everywhere. Yep delta burn that‚Äôll lol feel Completely agree, vaccinated I'm it, feel like it. touched mask couple months. Maybe I'll get eventually, maybe I'll go get ice cream instead. know caught (close family member, work, grocery store etc?)  2023, guess last till 2030. stop worrying shit tedros says, smart, would ended last year Absolutely. half country vaccinated vaccinated still spread it. CDC sacrificed kids politics Basically double digits cases last year. know surprising anyone, whenever there's outbreak somewhere military welding doors shut patrolling streets building demand quarantine hospitals outside city limits week. test aggressively often, population used wearing masks, infinite supply domestially manufactured vaccines medical supplies, course low case numbers. gut it‚Äôll quick. really burns population quickly India expect 5-6 weeks. Hopefully vaccinations it‚Äôll last wave. Keep eye UK seem 2-3 weeks ahead us.  supposed provide evidence for? I'm agreeing you. rationed care 8 months ago.  ran beds height pandemic, picked choose lived died based age, family status etc.  

This hospital ran beds need pick choose taken care sent home.  intake child traumatic head injury needs monitoring night someone didn‚Äôt bother vaccinated covid positive trouble breathing would really like know percentage unvaccinated vs vaccinated. There's really way make meaningful prediction.

Scotland appears Delta wave two months, another point comparison.  trust vaccine enough know get COVID, it‚Äôs extremely unlikely serious case. vaccinated people asymptomatic mild cases increasing frequency, either variants time since vaccination.

I‚Äôm pregnant due soon. husband get tested go hospital. there‚Äôs chance would allowed stay *for birth child* perfectly happy wear mask, he, avoid even asymptomatic positive test result.

Please note allowed second support person (doula) hospital stupid virus. I‚Äôm little bitter it.  Little kids home. I'm fully vaccinated I'm masking them. seeing mask mandates reintroduced states. I‚Äôm done‚Ä¶. shooting selves foot again. gives ammunition anti vax crowd. media needs stop focusing break case numbers focus death. 

I wear mask - part got vaccine. I‚Äôm tired protecting others. Everything said quotes POLITICIAN, medical expert.

He told us wear masks afraid everyone would hoard like toilet paper.

The facts: people f#cking stupid stubborn follow doctor advice listen redneck uncle Jimbo nut OAN. Rituals everyday habits arr frankly important neighbor's life. rituals important ur family's life. people dont care; they're stubbornly ignorant learn AIR BORNE VIRUSES grow need to.

Im @$$hole: virus disappears nothing happens.

Unless: flagrant disregard leads us deadly, mutant variant resists treatment vaccine alike. 

So truly numbers. die, nothing changes. Im mind save lot lives masking up, getting shot, treating like is: Pandemic. hoax. political agenda. worldwide disaster need respect mitigate.   Yes!!! unfair deal prioritized getting cautiously optimistic three months ago r/Coronavirus dying due increased vaccinations US. Ugh, really sucks.   call antiva. Double fucking mask? Jeez dude, calm fuck go get hazmat suit took vaccine works worked. point get variant work against, it. believe good people working ass try right ship, dealing conspiracy mayhem. us wearing masks already likely stop wearing anyone who's already wearing going put now.
 country filled far many self entitled fucks think walk around simple things protect people . hate doctor, supposed treat patients best ability.

From article, there's reason believe false. rest comment irrelevant. There's ton things can't *fully prevent* life. That's fearful limiting way live, call that. mean CDC jumped gun sure, Ron DeSantis fucking moron politicized shit virus. Ha! made giggle. read headline reddit comments. 

^(I'll go read article now) Whatever happened ‚Äúherd immunity?‚Äù Influenza (flu) COVID-19 (coronavirus) different types viruses. everyone got god-send vaccine could put whole thing rear view. Unfortunately national vax rates &lt;50% poses real risk vaccinated folks becoming unknowing vectors virus getting mild cases. real trouble begins unvaccinated idiots get turn mutagenesis factory fighting infection.  Two Moderna + J&amp;J whatever combination. Problem solved.

This country fucking slow reacting everything. used Disney passholder. pass expired start pandemic. go back while. first opened safely saw friends went, control. expect? $$$$$ Positivity rate means fuck-all people even bothering get tested anymore. hospitalizations paint much clearer picture. sub joke lol

I make kids mask rare occasions go out. mask make feel less alone. keep hearing need mask ‚Äúfor kids,‚Äù I‚Äôm sure. Especially parents aren‚Äôt worried. JJ. I've seen two studies small sample size. Canada using doses anti vaxx population refuses take.

So thanks snow mexican neighbors. read original comment. person stated they‚Äôve done everything could protect care about. they‚Äôve stopped caring willingly don‚Äôt want protect . 

It sounds nice caring everyone, realistically don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible care much people don‚Äôt want help themselves. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair assume people share opinion heartless assholes.  He's saying would courteous Great Lakes water good, high mineral content. mostly deep ground water need worry about. places get public water source wells need go deeper wells dry out. ‚ÄúCOVID doesn‚Äôt care you‚Äôre ready move on!‚Äù

I swear people treat virus deity worship. COVID doesn‚Äôt make formal announcement it‚Äôs ready us go back normal, society individuals determine it‚Äôs time based risk assessments.

If someone fully vaccinated, every right mask mandates new restrictions. We‚Äôve done part we‚Äôve done risk assessments. you‚Äôre scared, stay inside. don‚Äôt make us too. NGL love wearing masks indoor. Yeah, seems like 3-4 standard. caught COVID two weeks ago fully vaccinated since April. symptoms loss taste smell started coming back two days tested positive, back 100% week.

I‚Äôm concerned anymore. vaccine job. Still going go around licking doorknobs, I‚Äôm ready live normal life again. going headline says, verbatim, 'might want consider' ?

it's suggestion. people sooooooo fucking stupid hurts. People realize wear mask even fully vaccinated. Seems like common sense me. husband fully vaccinated still wear mask face shield go SEA. Could difference variants. Alpha less likely pass delta health care worker, agree.  think also important us vaccinated use environment around us make decisions. theory, vaccinated persons go without masks. see one town, store, etc wearing masks, know 36% county vaccinated, reasonably deduce would good idea continue wearing one.  Teachers incredibly melodramatic difficulty jobs people treat them. alright. think point mention vaccinated people wearing masks gives ammo anti-vaccine people complain. focus getting people vaccinated.  See article vaccines work. They're either finally realizing dire situation is, sick tired want over.  15 minutes often enough time stand line checkout counter grocery store. 30 minutes (everyone masked) makes huge difference.

And cloth masks created equal. ones double triple layers filter better. also metal nose piece better fitment. see chart proper fitting (proper seal) crucially important - proper donning doffing procedure. Even needs another dose, it‚Äôs big deal they‚Äôve got tons it. knows even dose, mean seemed widely used (or least widely used was) area really evidence statistically worse vaccines.

All fuel anti vaxxers. 12 kids risk covid lower risk normal flu science reason way covid interacts body. kids able flu season without masks normal year there's reason wear unless they're country slow vaccine rollouts might transmit virus someone risk. China comedian kinds statements  focusing 2% vaccinated people hospitalized due covid ignoring 98% unvaccinated dying it. run around busy highway, need watch left right. mean get hit car, risk low. are, complaining people got hit cars ignoring idiots running around busy highway. intentionally, probably, always XKCD that... last time checked. Fort Worth chance? 

Part surprised really. Vaccine readily available everywhere understanding harder hit areas tend lowest vax rates. coworkers want get already big deal. one already got twice gone months second time considering getting it. mentioned I‚Äôm saying remember hearing Dr. Osterholm speaking COVID-19 podcast episode made little CDCs mask update. fair back May I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs changed stance since. 

Regardless though, said RNA viruses. mutate often. It‚Äôs exclusive COVID-19. mask forever save us ongoing mutations COVID viruses? 

I don‚Äôt think so, thankfully, vaccine still currently holds particular virus‚Äôs advanced mutation - hope continues. I'm upset. I'm annoyed illogical arguments.

Again, hard.

Vax gives 80% infection (even asymptomatic still transmissible) versus Delta. N95 gives 99.5% (or so). Combined, near bulletproof, close 100%.

Wearing mask moments public wear mask around unvaxxed child easy choice.

We're done. Shinebox. Children who‚Äôs parents make wear masks ridiculed children anti-mask parents.

There must mask mandate schools. RIP 43. still wear mask even though I‚Äôve vaxxed months. People nasty. haven‚Äôt sick year half, exception COVID January, brought home ye olde roommate. Yeah political climate missed half US genuinely believes Covid exaggerated ""just flu."" Hence makes total sense they'd tear mask first opportunity.  Excellent. Might made arrangements, apparently timely? told avoiding exposure rest life, fun that. mrna ones, no. Ugh, fine. like it. Ok, need get upset. saying wear mask. whatever want dude.

All asking was, given protection wearing mask negligible compared protection gives others (the wearer), deem prudent enough wear gain small boost protection yourself, follow logically would wear time get much larger boost protection giving others? Thank God!  Noble sentiment. someone hellbent destruction, make sense stop caring, caring means nothing them. unvaccinated people. never red vs blue thing. vaccinated vs unvaccinated. conservatives turned red vs blue political circus.  sorta expected July 4th, right? timeframe right we're still going 2-14 days. good thing course. saying got death boner?
That‚Äôs kinda ‚Ä¶ wow ummm far man far. Heck they're trying flat incite lynch mob Fauci claiming created virus.

This plain instigation.  Never something predictably tragic. Lost mother covid (pre-vaccine availability). I've vaccinated months months. ready move since weeks second dose.

The mask stays off. I've done part want move fuck on. love families get vaccinated keep safe. I've got problems others wearing masks mine going back on. /s needed üòÅ Vaccines work, that's end it. media scaremongering change science. antivaxxers finally paying piper mean things actually getting worse. Deaths hospitalizations way vaccinated people much risk would seasonal flu. Case numbers mean nothing context, thing matters vaccine number serious illness, improving. cases happening vaccinated people. 98% covid hospitalization unvaccinated. Fauci warning vaccinated there's still chance might catch it. big problem here. point? see people clinic. Bro, waiting room immunocompromised people there's signs every door. I'm sick death people. Lots people got January February. couldn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs much. mean would really to. around 3 hour mark really starts bother me. I‚Äôm lucky go office yet. 

Quite spoiled. wife worked high risk medical field. face basically got bruised intense 10 hour shift masking  exactly big burden.

It be, places people gotten shot asking people wear masks. 

There different levels caution. people wiping groceries. understanding little evidence show COVID transmitted contact. makes sense stop wiping things. One could argue take much effort continue wiping groceries. think main frustration CDC essentially said vaccinated people done pandemic. seems irresponsible, hard walk back. 

Mainly, confusing. last time grocery store everyone wearing mask except employees man scrubs. think bodes well strong collective response pandemic. Seeing low vaccination rates though, might already window. 

Largely, ask people around me, especially employees, would prefer wear mask. agree big burden wear face mask. concerned implications close gatherings, number close contacts, staying 6 feet, etc. Exactly this. older person FL today tell 99% sure wouldn‚Äôt get it, may another reason ridiculous is. riding full covid wave since December, never chance decrease daily cases less 10k less 500 deaths daily since then...  get people weird this. Even overabundance caution what's matter you? whole world went pandemic knew little about. Experts sending clear message. Let people feel safe ffs. know still get it. I'm willing put life hold anymore. going go away.  Wrong. Lots states obesity, bmi 30 , health condition. That's half population 65 30 bmi states, Texas included. Israel attained herd immunity pre delta. again. Money Cold, flu, allergies, pollution, social anxiety...there number reasons someone might mask besides addition covid. Hell yeah, exactly point. Orlando too, made abt double tips year. third outbreak concerning, point im fully vaccinated, im happy take money, whether putting risk unvaxxed handss.... That's March 2020 - claims vaccine. feel vaccinations lulled many false sense absolute security, delta variant started rise. Sure significantly safer much less fear, people underlying health risks acting like there's way anything could happen them. sad got them.  I'm worried university allowing Sinovac (50% efficacy) meet vaccine requirement.  Yep, get post-exposure also get (very expensive) dose immunoglobulin peoples antibodies) deal virus vaccine mounts bodies immune response. able get post-exposure rabies vaccination immunoglobulin developing symptoms looking pretty much 100% success rate, immunoglobulin (an unfortunate reality much developing world) vaccine always avoid rabies. mouth breathing knuckle draggers dismiss hoax/conspiracy. Actually I'll take good source percentage protection. I'm curious. I've following /r/COVID19 throughout pandemic based posts comments conclusion really offer tremendous protection cases. seems ""some"", never really definitive amount. I'll gladly proven wrong you. Brexitland stage Chernobyl turned sensitivity geiger counters going much? get it. title shortened version quote. convey exact message. Tf about? think it‚Äôs complicated. think virus arose nature. also think China wants inquiry handling virus December -January -February -March.

There question inquiry pushed politics science. hope blows back criminally incompetent Tedros finally gets pushed out.  Simple solution, take people covid ward. Tell go inside, PPP. See many it. say no, ask why, see answer is.

It fake confronted head on. Cannot see forest trees.  That's you, probably work hospitals, schools, places flu wanders about. 

So bother many people others wearing masks. 

I honestly care others wear one, they're vaccinated, point you. Youre right necessities gym important ones health especially, able stay fit wonders keeps people productive lives whole. Without theres lot social, physical, mental issues persist whole. 

In regards people sweating, breathing heavy, touching equipment regularly thats true take precautions:

(wear mask, wipe every part aforementioned equipment use somehow get virus exposed hands nothing unless bring eyes scratch nose inhale mouth) either way shouldnt gym first place lol. wont get covid.

I've going 6 months covid free taking precautions, wearing mask, keeping distance people, washing every part equipment spray gym provides, making sure touch face, eyes, mouth touching equipment. Thats protect everyone three things gym lot recreational areas would much safer. really hard we're surrounded idiots day day lives. FDA approval next year major vaccines.

Almost 50% children died reaching adulthood advent modern medicine (Vaccines, antibiotics real medicine).  


Vaccine schedule closer one five. True true I'm thinking akin amputees.  true. Why? read up, use thrusted sources validate myself. One country? Many countries reporting observations.

I 18 month old son home. also risk sister (vaccinated mid 30s) takes care 93 year old woman refusing vaccine laws (over weight mid 60s) vaccinated living outside home. However, watch son work keep daycare (for becoming hard starts 2 weeks). interact daily basis basis. 

My son's pediatrician reccomended husband continue mask even though vaccinated due delta (we Florida) surging low community vaccine rate. outdoor activities areas less crowds (playground morning, zoo first opens keeping distance). Nothing indoors kiddo yet. taking store less busy, pediatrician said stop. 

My laws, even though vaccinated (Pfizer Moderna) lot high risk activities. masks, parties, travel plane high surge areas, ect. told pediatrician told us mask grandsons sake, claim gone back masking. sister always masks well never stopped watches son. 

My husband essential employee (mechanic) wears mask work. try curbside pick whenever possible. I'm going back teach person university mask mandates vaccines. upgrading Kn95s. 

We forgo house parties lost lot friends. never get invited anymore. unvaccinated. try cut contact non vaccinated individuals outside work.

It‚Äôs great. least I‚Äôm alive lol. Since politicians give shit think Infection numbers don‚Äôt matter 

Every expert field disagrees you. agree important see many people dying how/why dying, pretend infection numbers matter pandemic willfully ignorant. either way people vaccinated? bad reaction effect literally anyone else? people acting like hes taking legitimate stance something really case all, hes dimwitted asshole hes eric clapton coincidentally always dimwitted asshole Stupidity alone death sentence.

It be, often times is. desperate. Desperate dying people beg things KNOW possible. seems like human nature me. Well, apparently known cases wherein fully vaccinated people contract virus remain non-symptomatic. Masks might still wise special situations. Lockdowns unfair far extreme affect everyone regardless age, vaccination status personal health. Also domestic vaccine passports kept even threat covid pretty much nil, they‚Äôre bad idea.

1. 'immunity' mean? I've read language describes vaccines providing ""protection against"" viruses sure means since person contract virus vaccinated.
2. vaccine effectiveness mean? asking response like ""it represents well vaccine works larger population"" tell *is.*
3. contract virus, thing saying infected'?
4. read vaccines actually make immune virus. someone explain whether accurate not? asking question part confirm ""immune"" means. Yet GOP politicians tell residents get vaccinated. Makes sense. vaguely remember HIV something like you‚Äôre wearing N95 equivalent, mask helping all. cloth paper mask helps stop spreading virus stopping sneeze gross particles talking, etc. live 2 elderly risk family members fully vaccinated (one obese host issues), I'm still going take lot precautions. know still infected covid, probably mild symptoms it'll clear days. suppose caught flu would stay away avoid getting sick, too. 

Catching surfaces seems extremely low risk, coughing sneezing easily pass germs viruses. So, suppose head cold rough cough, ever cough sneeze near (do elbow, to). you‚Äôre wearing N95 equivalent, mask helping all. cloth paper mask helps stop spreading virus stopping sneeze gross particles talking, etc. Spanish used taking order government. It‚Äôs one first things noticed. never question authority. include those?  Yes! Same! launch space next? can‚Äôt get vaccinated social distancing.

That‚Äôs vaccinations work. don‚Äôt ‚Äúchoose lessen risk‚Äù getting measles polio getting individually vaccinated. vaccinate 90%+ people collective effect protects us. would like see mask recommendation say 70% vaccinated something like that. Use peer pressure good. Way less half. There's 90 something% effectiveness hospitalization exact percentage based vaccine varient.

""According to¬†[an Public Health England, two doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appeared 88 percent effective symptomatic disease 96 percent effective hospitalization delta variant.

The study suggested vaccine approximately 80 percent effective preventing infection delta variant. Scientists came conclusion analyzing 14,019 people infection, 166 hospitalized, Every day it‚Äôs new number. Fully vaccinated April pfizer, tested positive last week, super sick 5 days, I‚Äôm super congested coughing.   Thank powering anxiety protect others. hard impressive! CDC make decision Biden could make announcement. nothing back opinion case. fact people following guidelines anything enforce unless individual governors willing that. political decision, thought would give us best chance getting people vaccinated could get back normal. Probably even - UK exactly (no indoor visits, limited outdoor meet ups only, plus mask mandates) still bigger waves rules first (pre-masking) wave. vaccinations started, next wave still spreading - 90% less lethal, thanks vulnerable fully vaccinated. olympics case study completely ignore health advice make money.

This justification Olympics held right now.  real reason. doesn‚Äôt care anyone party. using straw? called innovative! However, experiencing huge surges hospitalizations deaths among vaccinated people, goal along. overwhelmingly unvaccinated adults ending hospital dead. People need go get shots. saw post talking deaths New Jersey. 49 fully vaccinated people died. less 1 100,000. 49 elderly, severe co-morbidities, both. Again, people need go get shots. route this, social restrictions.  I‚Äôm considering attending community college Fall, I‚Äôm seriously considering wearing N-95 on-campus, largely don‚Äôt want miss two weeks classes family paying for.

I don‚Äôt necessarily like masks I‚Äôm one people going carried away buying different designs, serve purpose protecting don‚Äôt test positive stay home 24/7 two weeks. still virus *known* harmful children, vs vaccine probably isn't.

In delta surge/endemic scenario, expect children get point, it'll bit sucky know given option opt all. scenario I'd prefer take kid's chances vaccine personally, given choice. always get names two confused. Thank you. Grad school paying off! üòÇ  Either vaccine closer healthy weight would likely saved man's life. latter would also saved mitigated bunch health problems. talk one other, especially since become collective thing we're responsible for?

No one troll man's FB find size--it's right thumbnail.  quit fighting people vaccinated cruise ships. spend energy encouraging base actually vaccinated exactly right. horrendous death toll US, driven country‚Äôs steadfast refusal implement suppression strategies proven work, one look kind sentiment COVID‚Äù anything contempt disdain.

Going maskless reckless vaccinated, risking contraction chance long haul syndrome, all, glad wear mask escape fate chance. young person, frontal lobe immature, odds calculations notoriously bad. every possible bad thing happens people, know. Fit, young, Olympic athletes experiencing inability exercise months mild symptom contraction still. focused upon something cannot change. CDC guidelines recommend wear mask vaccinated high exposure areas

The majority states hit 70% vaccinated yet, would say point herd immunity kicks in, LOT people live high exposure areas. know do. delta variant vaccinated highly contagious serious cases.

Where getting this? seen enough data say anything like confidently. flu cold also cause long term damage even death I'm going wear mask avoid social gatherings fear that.

Good you. us will. avoid social gatherings since flu big risk COVID given lung issues, I'll continue wear mask, affect anyone me, really can't fathom care much. strange ""follow science/guidelines"" crowd dismissing others personal feelings.

It's strange even seem know CDC guidelines. pre-existing condition, [the CDC actually continue wearing mask adhering precautions recommended unvaccinated go **People condition** taking medications weaken immune system, **should continue take precautions recommended unvaccinated people advised otherwise healthcare provider.** posted sub morning. We‚Äôre agreement part. think LA‚Äôs move makes sense cases spiking hard population centers exponentially spread quickly get hand.

Delta R0 6, meaning every one person infected, average, spread six people takes little week infections registered it‚Äôs much lagging indicator. double earlier Covid.

With R0 6 spread looks like couple months. 

100 people, 600, 3,600, 21,600, 129,600, 777,600

People aren‚Äôt moving goalposts virus I've read, deaths vaccinated involve severe chronic conditions. [Feel free correct wrong.]

Without vaccine they'd surely die COVID-19. vaccine least possibility survival. weird.... people getting blasted suggesting rising cases could still problem era vaccinations. Maybe avoiding immunity word altogether. Like saying vaccines highly effective preventing disease. notion might immune still risk getting sick makes sense, even though that's case everything. would say they're immune chicken pox unlucky people get twice.  assumes presence vaccine immunity would allow virus ‚Äúlearn.‚Äù don‚Äôt that. bacteria can, viral mutation entirely random. given mutation arise person immune status. It‚Äôs slightly less likely vaccinated person, since immune system clear viral load faster. Republicans graduated voter suppression voter elimination. probably enact law Texas die Covid vaccine, must‚Äôve Republican go ahead cast vote you. scared Pfizer vaccine immunity decreasing level grandparents become vulnerable again? fully vaccinated since April I'm fully vaccinated still proudly wear mask order protect unvaccinated around me.  Pretty sure catching Covid unvaccinated nurse hospital autoimmune disease human right, many people articles apply math completely wrong, quite possibly purpose make vaccines look better (and need to, vaccines already great!).

Calculations use breakthrough cases number vaccinated individuals individuals exposed COVID. Attempting calculate efficiency way essentially computing cumulative risk increase time, good trait trying measure efficiency.

The proper way calculate efficiency 1 - (breakthrough cases/vaccinated population)/(unvaccinated cases/vaccinated population). However, this, need know number breakthrough cases unvaccinated cases timeframe number people vaccinated relatively stable. Instead, articles tend give total number breakthrough cases time, complicates calculating actual efficiency.

Once efficiency, key formula: 
risk = (1 - efficiency) \* prevalence 

In words, increase prevalence increases risk vaccinated people. Many people would like believe vaccinated ignore COVID, least somewhat right. However, half protection enjoyed summer due vaccinated directly, half come amount herd immunity lowering prevalence. Unfortunately, Delta quickly erasing half protection. know several vaccinated people caught delta variant past week. They‚Äôre isolating going back masks etc, don‚Äôt want make people sick. need install Far-uvc lamps everywhere! kills bacteria viruses harm skin eyes. Same! son 4 next month upset likely wait winter age group. I‚Äôm 8 months pregnant brother hoping immunity passed vaccinations him. Imagine putting politics front health... 


GET VACCINATED DUMMIES! % 17% ended hospitals serious symptoms, would next question. people place.

Fauci might want consider putting faith vaccines promoting stop giving fuel anti-vaxers public comments. Check top comment might feel better.

Micrograms ...about 6 months late. Yeah easier said done already gone last year. terrible, halt everything postpone lives year. feels like happening yet terrible luck timing everything got vaccine started tweeting hands went numb ‚Äúthought he‚Äôd never play guitar again‚Äù became ammo anti vax 

I know alt right uncle posts time Yeah, maybe so. want armchair doctor situation, sounds quite plausible. Still really point, since without symptoms, would probably take stance crowd vaccination requirement thing. objected existence news article analysis data. even said data exist accessible.

Perfect time Ron Hubbard 2.0 start scientology-like for-profit religion, time focused around anti-vaxxination.

This really long gets pretty technical, worth  kinda nuts depressing. One part also sticks mind editors magazine Continuum consistently denied existence HIV/AIDS. magazine shut editors died AIDS-related causes.[92] still likely due masks filter and/or seal well (if masked 100% time). amount inhaled would still way amount surface gets person's system way needed get infected. perfect give general idea difference type mask fit make: 

Nearly everyone I've seen mask one clearly fit well made cloth (to clear still better mask). course, surfaces still issue pathogens easy mitigate risk hand sanitizer washing, especially eating. lot concern children right US lies fact new School years start. Obviously 12 year olds can't vaccinated yet, percentage 12-17 year olds vaccinated still pretty low. current data severity kids getting Covid-19 based last 12-18 months greatly insulated, mask wearing mostly mandatory. nothing short ignorant political reasons, lot areas US requiring unvaccinated students wear masks. Schools generally crowded, many reduced eliminated social distancing requirements.

Masks Social distancing help reduce viral loads. I'm arguing kids lower risk, concern relaxing Social distancing mask wearing among unvaccinated people, combined new variants could lead spread among kids, serious cases. less experienced far, projecting experience changes guidelines new variants. Oh no! hope better. 

I think seeing people go walk fine I'm still waiting area defeating me. Well, Regan privatized medicine shut 600 hospitals, mostly rural areas. less hospitals beds early 80's, despite 100 million people. variant rendering mRNA vaccines useless improbable bordering impossible guy always says one thing another.

First ‚Äúdont wear masks, dont help‚Äù admitted made people dont hoard supply medical practitioners. 

Yeah, that‚Äôs called lying. PCR ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù precise detecting small amounts virus misses 9-30% people infected pretty high false negative rate. Somewhere 1 10, 1 5, 1 3 people misdiagnosed *not* Covid sent back community spread it. 

2020 lot Asians wear due air quality, necessarily disease cannot even begin imagine amount strength patience would necessary health worker states infamously mass vaccinations. People like this, heart gold, truly inspiring hope successfully make through, even people believe work.

To doctors: Keep strong. Keep brave. endeavours mean everything us. course not, mean lawsuit likely go anywhere. got 1st vaccine almost 3 weeks ago Publix. also hesitant can't stand needles barely even felt it. pharmacist cleaning area alcohol swab bracing pain like ok done. arm sore couple hours later lasted 18hrs fine. read first shot bad symptom wise, second one may develop worse symptoms, crossing fingers bad get 2nd couple weeks. Wouldn‚Äôt deaths relation spread Delta variant relevant? It‚Äôs known original variant bad age group, claims new variant bad younger people include data newer variant. You‚Äôre downvoted cited source useless back claim. know. seems like something that. humid day south Florida felt like water boarding mask on‚Ä¶ good friend west coast 30s said many friends get vaccinated, honest tell friends idiots find new ones. much rebuttal. Thats assumption, possible mutation occur vaccinated immune person (especially developed poor immune response), however significantly less probable someone without vaccination sort immunity. time numbers game comes mutations.

If vaccinated, there's less chance mutation occurring immune system target non-mutated variations recognizes neutralize get chance replicate. Less viruses replicating shorter time periods reduces chance/opportunities mutation occurring immune system recognize.

For unvaccinated people virus enters basically going efficient factory pumping replications, mutated (many harmless, reducing transmissibiliy, increasing transmissibility). vaccinated, factory security team identifies intruder quickly kicks out. intruder may pumped copies far fewer times neutralized. Less replication, less chance mutation.

Now multiply little mutation factories every person unvaccinated see one replications might, evolutionary processes, create slightly varied version vaccinated immune systems currently targeting. Vaccination silver bullet this, no, bazooka least. less likely possible, yeah, especially new variants come need allowing COVID circulate. may even end rendering vaccine useless. really know. willfully unvaccinated people scum.  way media went reporting news likely gonna stir panic, reality, it‚Äôs still effective vaccine. It‚Äôs theatre people choice work person public, especially family vulnerable breakthrough infection. sisters husbands grandma died it. (So BIL Grandma). still want get it, touched family directly. asked talk PCP hesitancy. upset let three year old see children want risk it. Nobody bureaucracy going want come new policies fly middle crisis, think situation certain level ""done,"" need long, uncomfortable conversations much risk we're willing take there's genuine global immediate threat life going on. 

We knew time phase II trials done vaccine safer getting disease. Yes, low-incidence risks discovered released vaccines, specifically blood clots heart inflammation, discovered release even approval took regular two-plus years. even then, risks rounding error compared risks getting disease.

If happens lifetimes, need let anyone who's willing take new vaccine much much sooner process. absolutely mandate anyone we've enough time find low-incidence risks, could saved hundreds thousands lives USA given people option early process. Well, going extra mile me; going extra mile unable get vaccinated. I'm mandated vaccinations sets unhealthy precedence future. However, data lie. [97+ percent people hospitals due covid get vaccinated me, get vaccinated yourself. probably realized killing voters ‚Ä¶ though. regular flu kill millions people every years. reason it‚Äôs vaccine around 50% effective. people‚Äôs point here. majority people getting vaccinated poor minorities. poor white doesn‚Äôt mean morons. post racist bigoted ""49 people seatbelts still died car accidents. Here's know: Study finds seatbelts save many lives, every time.""   got Moderna know others who‚Äôve Pfizer they‚Äôve told 

Side effects: varies person. sore arms injection site. could still raise arms discomfort nothing would stop going day day life. last two three days 

Average appointment times vary, shouldn‚Äôt take 30 minutes. There‚Äôs 15 minute waiting period shot, rest time depends long takes sign form actually inject 

Needles: everyone know said didn‚Äôt even feel it. personal experience simply turned head blink eye. Taking band aid later hurt actual shot 

Main perk piece mind knowing extremely well protected, even original risk low. You‚Äôre also contributing overall safety others around lower spread. Also get free doughnuts Krispy Kreme there‚Äôs It‚Äôs impossible say without PCR test. don‚Äôt know guidelines jurisdiction US would advise get PCR test, self isolate pending results. Daughter lives EU. She‚Äôs fully vaccinated, husband. 

They wearing masks indoors along. 

Let‚Äôs face it: US crazy stupid. 

The vast majority us idea vaccines work. Way many us don‚Äôt understand 90% effective vaccine infection means every time close proximity another unmasked person, infected, there‚Äôs 10% chance be, too. 

With flu vaccine, efficacy 50%. Masks good idea. Period. getting genie back bottle. plead want people, it‚Äôs late. Ok, you‚Äôre directly contradicting Pfizer‚Äôs release, well 100% reporting statements public officials. 

You‚Äôll get argument vaccine isn‚Äôt nearly effective advertised! Amazing downvoted asking this. 3-week old, 3 paragraph article pretty light substance. see data? got sore arm despite Covid previously. wasn‚Äôt sore‚ÄîI could still use arm. side effects tinnitus went away two weeks. 

I didn‚Äôt even feel needle all. wasn‚Äôt looking gave chatting person giving me. felt finger brush arm, didn‚Äôt feel anything else. needle fine gauge likely won‚Äôt even notice. 

I got vaccine within 3 minutes arriving appt. waited waiting area 15 minutes afterward, way. 

The biggest perk greatly lessens chance dying hospitalization catch Covid. Also greatly reduced chances symptomatic case Covid. facebook, go look covid news youtube find dislikes anti covid vaccine comments top comments. comments, say ""real americans think instead reddit twitter.   Moderna week two behind Pfizer, J&amp;J couple months behind. think Moderna produced less Pfizer though, counting US.  believe, I've said before, current delta variant case surge reaches peak starts dropping, final surge. think we'll see one it. said ‚Äúif available‚Äù negative pressure rooms plenty people admitted winter ‚ÄúAirborne Isolation Units‚Äù (hospital‚Äôs term, mine). units made negative pressure rooms. regular Med/Surg beds sheets plastic hanging outside doors. Meanwhile DeSantis signed law that, among things, bans schools requiring COVID-19 vaccine *uniquely*, *specifically permanently.*

Hundreds colleges (so far) across country already requiring COVID-19 vaccines, zero Florida. (Florida colleges require many vaccines).

Florida public schools *long* *long* list required vaccines, COVID-19 vaccine never added list, regardless future FDA full Approval.

Talk *unbelievably* cheap guy. course eventually, pandemic last forever. Even covid endemic we‚Äôll eventually t-cell memory make cause mild cold like every coronavirus. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre projecting kind rage onto me, what, want.

I think incredible nuance decision making process. communicating effective solution public, think clear concise language best outcome. Go Gold expected, cases apparently mild even entirely asymptomatic. P.C.R. tests detect even minute traces virus.

It cycles involved PCR process. many cycles, get false positives. cycles, miss stuff (i.e. false negatives). balancing act.  side effects bad?

They usually bad enough prevent active. tend worse 2nd day take it. people also report side long average appointment? 

For scheduled appointment pharmacy, basically. I'd say 15-20 mins kind scared needles.

Just look. Keep eyes straight forward watch needle look it. may even realize done, tell perks vaccinated?

It could save life. Yes remember that! think federal leadership much willing listen respond changing conditions last one. Maybe dust idea since it‚Äôs clear need live long time. encouraging see news like this. Making vaccines widely available nations sparse access would save many lives.

Oh haven‚Äôt vaccinated I‚Äôm 17. got result back today definitely still must covid then. think now?

(and Reddit whole) greatly underestimate many young (20-30s) republicans country. think lot people must feeling strong sense personal pride vaccinated - sense getting vaccine threat sense identity.

Many people, all, invested *lot* energy pre-vaccinations arguing covid real, flu, harmless, lie invented lizard people, need masks freedom, etc etc etc...

So now, need get shot protect covid, perhaps actually feels like threat sense see world.

Not making excuses anyone, I've really trying understand anyone could afraid shot pandemic. starts make sense realize many people spent entire time jeering anyone took pandemic seriously, perhaps, people, getting vaccinated feels like betrayal kind. No. like another Asian country stopped counting February 4, 2020. Magically, basically cases since then.

Pathetic. Funny thing intubated multiple times. usually come back second one. lungs regenerate illness. Even people dont require intubation may significant lung damage could put risk something like flu. learn math.  


Chance get breakthrough infection vaccinated: \~ 10% 
Chance die infected vaccinated: \~ .001%.  


10 \* .001 = .01% 


Chance **surviving** vaccinated: 99.99%  people still playing pandemic? get shot would admitting last year half put themselves, loved ones, kids, parents,etc major risk serious illness and/or death. 

For lot people, easier keep believing lies everything right instead massively wrong. Again, you‚Äôre showcasing huge lack knowledge here. Wow....hell actually froze over. that‚Äôs true, keep reading articles people thousands dollars debt? cause people parents age group saw non-vaccinated life looked like aint playing shit. **I take hasn‚Äôt got bill yet!**  Friend around breakthrough case lost smell taste day two, slight headache week, tested negative Mask mandates public elementary schools save lives, every teacher access vaccine? likely change abruptly without warning like dropped mask mandate.  could everyone staring assume unvaccinated following rules. understanding flu vaccine protects serveral strains flu, covid19 vaccine protects one strain coronavirus (covid19). strain flu/coronavirus multiple variants, main difference number strains.  anyone else small gathering vaccinated unlucky?   Good call. Doctors Reddit. People like shouldn‚Äôt given mouthpiece spew nonsense. Shame CBS. Yes, vertically going now. CDC saying wear mask months ago really fucking helped surge.

From beginning said masks work latest one, they're bad holding position continue contribute problem. F him. months nudge-nudge wink-wink antivax dog whistles people come it? late. actions killed countless Americans. want way play sides now.

Shut put up. see both. fact vaccines lead herd immunity evidence provide sterilizing immunity right? arguing 100% high enough.

Never stopped wearing mask...   Ah damn, missed House quote! laws protecting types suits now, *could* change vaccines get full FDA approval. Yes, lifting restriction highly transmissible variant present caused surge. So, lifting restrictions ultimately problem, thanks proving point. link points vaccine notably less effective delta variant. Also, kids less protected variant. again, I'm sure smart enough understand I'll say anyway: vaccine helping reduce spread stopping spread. 

All points us needing responsible, cry moan expected part taking pandemic, still much pandemic, seriously. dont threaten good time wearing mask settles down, likely around summer 2022.

Optimistic totally realistic depending dig it. Honestly, I‚Äôd wear mask anyway, ATM. 

We‚Äôre downwind wildfires western Canada. 

My asthmatic lungs prefer breathing smoke. Ron DeSantis, Republican, issued executive order Friday prohibiting businesses requiring patrons customers show vaccine documentation, risk losing grants contracts funded state. immediately clear order applied state local government context. world changing combat pandemic (which still happening) you‚Äôre complaining - dressing rooms closed, etc. That‚Äôs you‚Äôre claiming inconvenient. Sorry that‚Äôs hard *you* understand üòä we'll soon variant vaccine provide protection from

I'm pretty sure already Delta variant. Israel high vaccination rate, 90%+ new cases Delta variant, 50%+ infected fully vaccinated. Generally speaking someone vaccinated without symptoms going get COVID test, pretty safe assumption large portion 50%+ experiencing symptoms bad enough go get tested. Facts irrelevant Redditors. It‚Äôs supporting hive mind.  Turn away hospitals printed PT regiment. course thoughts prayers Righty radical fundamentalists finally caught they're exterminating themselves. Mixed feelings. Pfizer Moderna nearly identical. Comparing CureVac Moderna like comparing J&amp;J AZ. Sure, use ""family"" tech, reality worlds apart. FYI, study Canada showing Moderna actually best Delta (better Pfizer). Moderna basically larger dose Pfizer.

You're getting downvoted ""people like facts"". getting downvoted talking ass, making definitive claims obviously knowing nuances talking about. making exact miske article trying compare J&amp;J AZ is.  Yes respect opinions anyone American. countries horrible places live.

Lmao, I'm vaccinated. Ain't wearing mask anymore. ‚ÄúNova Southeastern University hoping ability require COVID-19 vaccinations possible protect NSU Florida community. However, due new Florida law, university unable maintain policy. basically beliefs ""personal responsibility"" played back them. would open eyes health care reform needed it'd silver lining, won't.  Covid treatment isn‚Äôt covered mandate, large insurers partnered government establish waivers waive costs deductibles, coinsurance, copays. sense, government paying via cost sharing, although don‚Äôt know waivers end. Medicare medicaid use large insurers intermediates waiver policies would apply members. Personally think makes sense keep waivers place anybody vaccinated remove unvaccinated.


As far uninsured go, end costs. won‚Äôt pay though doesn‚Äôt matter since either taxes higher premiums ultimately pay anyways, like nearly always done. countries horrible places live.

Contrary vaccines wider range. disingenuous. wear PPE correctly catch flu, cold. contagious diseases. things made sure flu stayed away, looking numbers almost disappeared. 

If different disease like tuberculosis measles, yea stay home orders, cancelled events, travel restrictions would necessary curb spread. flu contagious, possible travel without catching it, provided wear mask.  mean get skeptical. vaccines first available.

I agree people really see urgency getting shot get one. fool believes wise man reason away. can‚Äôt win level stubborn crazy. far gone saved. Two major events happening September. major corporations preparing employees back site schools expected fully open. continue see spread like events jeopardy happening. past week 23k kids confirmed contracted covid, 100%+ increase time month ago.  guy sells merch making fun Dr Fauci. know asymptomatic plays it, read study found infected people 40-50% likely transmit vaccinated. 

The groupings unvaccinated tested positive, vaccinated tested positive. included asymptomatic symptomatic group big argument seems ""Because can't make me."" anything childish? killing voters. insignificant number, especially 1 2 family members every person murdered DeSantis gets little angry. person knows real number probably started math. care about. go:

It's like wanna called stupid. I‚Äôd say Americans don‚Äôt travel country. Maybe, big maybe Canada Mexico that‚Äôs it.  people posting seem like rather get COVID get vaccine people would rather get hospitalized extensive lung damage get vaccinated mild flu days

I see similar arguments coming people actually vaccinated makes angry. COVID going away within next five years, really think avoid getting kind illness whole time withdrawing society something?  administration got coast nice new vaccine still horrible job controlling pandemic. side handled piss poor virus effected morons refuse vaccination, could agree practice. man island, feel horrible medical professionals continually suffer pandemic. Yeah, sounds right given data set. 

Of course, mask effectiveness fuzzy number too, poking noses, dangling ears, pulled chins, *absolute freaks* took *cough* always thing, real world numbers aren‚Äôt going look like study numbers. 

Any way look it, don‚Äôt think masks top vaccines likely huge benefit. 

For *unvaccinated,* whatever reason, they‚Äôre still best thing available. Unvaccinated people still using them. (Though know whole lot aren‚Äôt.) Ralph Nader Dr. Fauci analogy correct? paperwork didn‚Äôt say I'm sure Nova Southeastern University's crack legal team getting right it. government still pay producers. free produce distribute. study linked article stating masks slash risk February 2021, vaccines readily available.

Or forget vaccines take go school. 

I'm team mandatory masks - point whole convo. Probably 3 reasons:

* Decreasing suppressive measures (masks, restrictions, social distancing, etc.).
* herd immunity (the unvaccinated play role here).
* Increasing amounts delta variant.  One really big problem Florida tourist destination. state low vaccination rates several regions result many tourists places vaccinated getting Delta variant bringing back home. non-virtual feedback loop causing many deaths suffering

In fact, audit really needs done much Covid spread caused early days travelers going leaving Florida.

Some Florida officials like Di Santis like brag strategy worked best keep comparing states like California, discount multiplier effect tourism state paid attention masks, business closings, beach closings, etc.

The tragedy brought denial virus vaccine protect almost hard large comprehend.  10% population live wears mask.

You even know talking lmao nobody gonna wear mask forever besides people there.  interesting, live 3 people first became sick, roommate vaccinated became sick, two vaccinated never got it, two negative tests each. Pathogens wild. read though vaccinated asymptomatic, transmissibility goes way down. anyone confirm least heard thing? r/nottheonion I've never heard doctor giving exemption, heard people ""saying"" doctors told get vaccinated, never anything show for.

I know see absurd. take route go rabbit hole could also argue CDC says vaccinated people need wear masks public loses trust vaccine. CDC implicitly saying vaccines effective - 1. untrue 2. bad idea proves many fears unvaccinated people. CDC tell truth - vaccines effective reward people get them. way complicating this. saying is... majority NFL players getting vaccinated? maybe league understands virus potential disrupt scheduled games, expected revenues, remove athletes together. public statement keep getting sued prior statements?

I'm confident I'm following guidelines current science. right now? agree could use data drawing solid conclusion maybe, see extend assume data actually wrong judge others making assumptions.

I'm pushing opinion you, concern one bit wear mask, support that, asking likewise push opinion me. seems like people's anger unvaccinated people wearing masks turned anger everyone wearing mask deserve that. I'm doctor here' understanding. reasons delta past variants started ""variants concern"" least one mutation alters spike protein. spike protein vaccine trains immune system recognize fight against. believe delta two significant mutations, someone feel free correct that.

Finally Singapore letting tourists letting people travel leisure. UK not. personally think parallels computing era - shrank pc tool lightbulbs desktop sized people started seeing office desks home - catalyst computer era.

Regular colds flu sucks, saying we're scared every little thing, unknown covid COULD do.  Sorry ignorant question, I've understand Pfizer Moderna vaccines use new kind vaccine technology makes easier create future vaccines faster safer. question quickly scientists create new vaccine specifically new variants (like Delta) quickly vaccine reach general public? still go year testing trials? states scannable QR codes vaccination records like California does? feel like would go long way toward allowing businesses enforce vaccination requirements.  completely normal since March state since majority people could get vaccines then. Brilliant whole country locked end sight? Lol ... demonstrated good stating obvious fact ... AGAIN. 

What next? Covid may kill people? Vaccine protect you? ‚ÄúAre people still alive?‚Äù kids low risk Covid, especially underlying conditions. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Wondering I'll good go work early tomorrow morning Thanks explaining, appreciate it. Good. son actually going IU fall. fully vaccinated back, makes feel even better.   I‚Äôm fully expecting yearly flu covid booster shot produced heavily subsidized first world nations citizens then.

Most people clue ""riskier"" means. Heck, afraid flying riding car. 

And since people love anecdotal examples instead actual properly estimated probabilities ... one. vaccinated, fully, late April, soonest could get shot. day, basically sore over, fever.

Probably perform tests annual boosters. don‚Äôt want inadvertently give children coronavirus. thought vaccine would prevent transmitting others. doesn‚Äôt appear case.  reason why? Except lockdowns extremely short people could normal lives outside them. I'm former. definitely mandatory. doubt mind. military play.

The vaccine received military ""optional"" anthrax vaccine, optional because:

a) experimental vaccine never received full suite clinical trials, FDA approval, AND

b) specific expectation would actually exposed anthrax war. 

Note reasons important. slightly earlier time, use anthrax U.S. troops considered real possibility, vaccine mandatory, practically so. 

(That told time, anyway-- given option forego anthrax vaccine. Whereas came through, U.S. Marine mid-2000s, given specific, explicit opportunity opt-out, generally known could refuse without consequence, couple did. 

On side note, particular vaccine caused nasty acute reactions Marines took it. never trouble, one staff sergeant particular injection arm swell like balloon days.) lack social life would probably damaging Covid honest. feel like landed new normal. go stores wearing mask. eat outside restaurants. socialize people outdoors. won‚Äôt lot indoors people outside bubble (I people know trust house unmasked though), eat restaurant go public transit. verge expanding Delta makes worry I‚Äôm much. I‚Äôm vaccinated kids 12 I‚Äôm terrified spreading anything them. also remain worried long Covid risk. anyone else feeling like Delta variant slowing return normality? Right I‚Äôm terrified asked return office requiring everyone vaccinated. locked brilliantly. everyone gets vaccinated it‚Äôs over. Locking everyone year half still lockdowns brilliant. Translated title: OPINION: Macron coercing French getting vaccinated ‚Äì seems like Eventually, turns new wave, they're going scream endlessly useless Biden is. enough die, backfire future elections. Choosing ignore distancing mask wearing spreading infection non-vaccinated individuals go experience hospitalization tantamount manslaughter IMO.

Hyperbole extreme effective getting others board message. makes look insane easily ignored. like underpants gnomes!!   Classic Yes, article fire even live Bama even vaccinated.  misinformation going around

This makes sound like rain storm--something can't anything prevent live with. reality dealing intentionally peddled lies. active process, passive one. Realistically, concrete answer. end madness, one certain way many factors consider like vaccination rates, misinformation, COVID variants change course pandemic. best advice give accepting pandemic end eventually moments while, current wave right now. FWIW may last ""big"" wave US. much calcium-oxalate spinach, nuts, potato chips, old city tap water staying hydrated enough. emergency surgery. stent put first one blasted 7mm sucker laser second one. Got stay conscious stent pulled wish hadn‚Äôt been. Basically don‚Äôt eat anything tasty drink shit load water don‚Äôt want get more.  Viral load plays huge factor also. necessarily person less risk, vs exposure level. Yeah man, stupid CDC tons tons data analytics, idiots know early drop mask new cases linked known outbreaks, 24 26 cases quarantine throughout entire infectious period.

Hopefully means numbers start dropping soon 
But goals beyond vaccines? thing beyond masks distancing forever, simply work. Yep exactly. soon words ""no masks"" came unvaccinated took mean ""awesome pandemic officially over."" üò£ Yeah, know multiple 30s vacc'ed mRNA vaccines gotten covid last 7 days. Knocked ass pretty scary way least avoid hospitalization. texas, none mentioned variants. parents in-laws vaccinated? vaccine effective widely available. time relegate problem (as Austrian Chancellor suggests) private sphere, making Covid personal issue choice deal it. Definitely would suck. tend consider 90+% efficacy rate small percentage vaccinated people fall smaller percentage. still need avoid exposure. people thought would like Asia everybody voluntarily wears mask public supposedly (even though majority Covid). Ok, pfizer then, Jonhnson&amp;Johnson?  study April found 34% Covid-19 survivors received diagnosis neurological psychological condition within six months infection

The CNN article mentions anxiety (17%) mood disorders (14%) common diagnosis. general US population [Anxiety Mood disorders understand saying ‚Äúneurological‚Äù ‚Äúpsychological condition‚Äù makes sound scarier, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs helpful read article citing!

Also article, ‚ÄúCovid-19 necessarily increase risk full spectrum neurological illness.‚Äù (In words, likely variables affecting this).

To blame COVID-19 without looking variables, honestly constructive covid impacts

Yes, heard argument many times. Refer ) also takes variables account. common symptoms ‚Äúlong covid‚Äù patients fatigue reduced exercise capacity. exact symptoms seen among obese/overweight people, account ) COVID-19 hospitalizations.  Sounds good. too. check vaccination rate zip code? website   get kidney stones? gotten surgery? 2 x AZ WOOOOOOT!!!! Lame. vaccinated people would crossing. non issue 64k dead. That‚Äôs like 20 9/11s watch. friends husband breakthrough case. High fever, headache, feels like crap, can't taste. Still better could - break cases real, asymptomatic positives. 

They test delta variety for.him, based work place, would guess delta. 6 people got sick once. Exactly. Americans took mean, ""ok cool act like im vaxxed, ever know?"" spread fewer people people around vaccinated symptoms milder hospitalization never understand distinction previously. Good know. improbable, still theoretically possible, although documented cases occurring far I‚Äôm aware.  Thanks! getting indeed plan.

The plan using wonderful vaccine saturate population longer circulating.

There however fatalists sides decision personally vaccinate best sabotage plan: vaccinate also vaccinate given achievable goal us getting covid all, they'd rather people including fellow vacinees keep dying, personally suffer inconvenience. Yeah, anybody tried say also straight attacked sub particular.... Blood already DeSantis‚Äô hands. obviously concern so-called followers, unvaccinated. He‚Äôs side along, too. died got infected toxic vaccine someone else. ^^^^^/s Cops conservative NYPD one worst major police departments country. yes, much rarer transmit point going bar la right sadly. What‚Äôs point going bar able socialize anyone outside party? Might well friends drinks save money.  directly responding claiming much California imposed mask mandate. 

What counties outside LA county implemented mask mandate?

All find counties recommending it. recommendation mandate. mention Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri reason. 

As none states sort universal state mandate regarding masks. fixed spelling error seems Arkansas positivity rate topping still 11%  confined space cloth mask adds 5 minutes protection terms time takes unmasked person person breathe infectious dosage covid aerosols unmasked person (15 minutes).An N95, fit tested, add 2400 hours time needed inhale infectious dosage. aerosol biology reports issued top authorities nation field year COVID-19 time run course. Dr Osterholm reported podcast. thanks‚Ä¶  clearly won‚Äôt catch US, besides outliers. People charged aggravated assault walking around mask unvaccinated. ok? Vaccine passports way go. photo picture succulent? card wallet size big mistake! employers required enforce masks. go get new job within week? Pickup move Phoenix?

The Vegas market pretty specialized too. casino dealer can't leave one casino mask mandate go another. enforcing want economy die... again. mostly unspoken lies attitude way say say. example stuff like ""sure fine want mask, means feel need make feel safe."" That's basically saying ""hide bed need to, reacting, really needed."" Totally ignoring real epidemiological functionality masking etc. helps calm scared peoples fears. ignorance infuriating say least.   Australia.

We 6-12 months behind guys vaccinations guess we'll discussions due course. Glad never stopped wearing mine public despite a) house fully vaxed w/ Pfizer, b) age 35 &amp; relative good health, c) work home, &amp; d) living city without major outbreak &amp; decent (but could better) vaccine uptake. times go stores person max on, including staff. think wearing mask going become habit mine like putting headphones every time go alone. Breaking habit feel weird whenever get around it. want get sick? there's highly contagious bug around Im wearing mask want get sick, matter hospitalization. Lockdowns would make little difference point unvaccinated people spreading COVID like wildfire amongst follow restrictions anyway.

A mask mandate however visible easy enforce businesses. Easier say keeping people congregating privately possible. suppose not. worse things happen wear face mask I'm around strangers. exactly fault? Looks like messages getting deleted. get I'm saying undergirding consider broken value system. 

The reason lockdowns work Australia culturally are, general, happy take hit greater good even though grumble it. government also somewhat socialistic, healthcare welfare important well regarded institutions (relative US).

More government spending would ameliorate many things mentioned - economy (through stimulus), mental health (lessen fear poverty without work), education, supporting people businesses. etc. money there, US richest country world. tax biggest corps redistribute. politics impossible culture. 

Culturally yes uphill battle. Political tribalism, anti-intellectualism, obsession 'freedom', romanticised narratives violent uprising, distrust government institutions, rampant inequality, etc. right, even better public health policy able fight that. 

To final question, yes smart make policy based hope people unlimited patience, assume large majority people would a) ok patient means people die, b) willing accept evidence-based public health policy. Neither values Americans hold.  basically end game you?  Im curious this, CDC said start treating covid like flu/common cold? see saying anywhere yet anti-maskers spout ""follow science"" treat like Texas. forget exact date mask mandate lifted, plenty people stores well ignoring mask mandates. remember going local stores noticing people(like probably 20 more) walking around masks none workers said anything. blame them, either. Big sign door saying masks required enforced all. 

But covid while, going get real school starts back up. Seems like delta much better reproducing, means need mightier immune response people (vaccinated not) simply can't execute also means viral loads shed higher.


So need agile army fight it, delta sends armies (viral loads) bigger armies vaccines' efficacy rates tested measured.


The CDC absolutely dropped ball jumping gun mask mandates. boneheaded messaging completely touch way ignorant masses would receive act it.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lol Israeli study likely overestimated protection? several times frontline worker possible exposures, family got vaccinated. 

Our protocol stay different level house, windows open air circulation. wore mask kept 10 ft away whenever needed common areas. either ate food, washed hands waited leave house using kitchen. also used different bathroom everyone else. 

I‚Äôm saying appropriate course action situation - that‚Äôll depend family‚Äôs risk tolerance resources - that‚Äôs made work. It'll spread control run hospitals. Leading lock downs.

Lockdowns likely. Almost 70% 18+ vaccinated. Almost 80% 55+ vaccinated. groups traditionally ended hospitalized.

There still lot people get sick, stretch hospitals limit, die. good.

But going lock again. ""The Q-Virus"" sub needs stop asinine comment every time new article posted. 

Do honestly believe fully vaccinated people driving current wave? evidence points unvaccinated problem. Even wave started, constant articles pointing would upcoming wave amongst unvaccinated. 

Mask mandates don‚Äôt fix that, vaccines do. 

Did everyone suddenly forget we‚Äôve spent past year bitching people abiding mask mandates, people don‚Äôt want vaccinated. Again, mask mandate doesn‚Äôt fix problem. 

The unvaccinated never wearing damn mask begin with. Absolutely. needs face campaign get people realize horrors reality instead conspiracy vaccines. eh, vaccinated constitute 0.5% deaths. sounds like fairly good indicator immunity. They're exposing themselves. They're exposing others vaccination choice. mention vaccine 100% effective either. getting vaccinated able supremely selfish decision. way Apple Health app. vaccine provider's mobile app (MyChart) installed, MyChart app links data Apple Health. time shots, noticed provider's data Apple Health following location: go Browse scroll Health Records section Immunization section found Pfizer vaccine record including vaccines I've received like influenza. always billed way out, let‚Äôs move goalposts.

The virus moving target whether like Delta changed rules game significantly.

It's disappointing, back early May actually looking promising Israel UK track soon reach numbers would contact traceable zero Delta cases took off.

Countries different risk tolerances I'm advocating particular restrictions anywhere, however crazy expect goal posts never moved given unpredictable virus is; possibility vaccine-resistant variants emerging going ongoing concern.  Cool story bro prove I‚Äôm vaccinated still wear mask? happening.     supposed quarantine people live with?  It‚Äôs insane many people live country vaccines readily available refuse get   Ya no. Since vaccine everyone didnt get problem. care variant is, dont want catch get vaccinated. Hey! got dishonorable mention youtube rat!  think it‚Äôs combination Delta, fears twindemic inch closer Fall, fears another mask mandate lockdown could coming soon, Republicans finally beginning change tune, people wanting see relatives holidays safely. reading data correctly? 4122 breakthrough infections *between* July 7 July 13, 4122 *cumulative* breakthrough cases *as of* July 13? thought latter. Oh we're getting there. people chosen harder way get antibodies. vaccine feeling sick? still catch pass along virus won‚Äôt feel it? I‚Äôm gonna feel like moron I‚Äôve walking around gym huffing puffing thinking immune couldn‚Äôt virus. Also thank kind response. Lost last year's birthday whole summer COVID, excited 30th year many people coming. today due kind news plans completely cancelled again. 

It's devastating depressing. might close shop stick video games therapy years now. Making plans crushed worse plans all. I‚Äôve jumped hoops set front me, lost job, got another one, got two shots arm. I‚Äôm done refuse go back masks restrictions people refuse get shot/be political pawn. Look graphs, it‚Äôs early stage fast zoom right back beyond.  represents complete failure Missouri leadership encourage population get vaccinated. Lower antibody levels compared what? different covid variant? different vaccine? Natural immunity infection? Naive uninfected immunity? time scale? clip cut strip context would skeptical result message uploader trying send.

I guess related basically says we've known while. Antibodies vaccines less effective delta variant original strains. five six fold decrease sounds scary necessarily correlate drop real life neither lab tech always find hilarious use footage someone pipetting blue dye microtiter plate they're science. South Korea 13% fully vaccinated, compared nearly 50% US despite vaccine becoming politicized US. Malaysia 15%, Japan 13%, India 6%. Even US 50% big surges new cases across country.

The Asian countries started going back pre-covid lives way early. concerned (USA) another possible quarantine even lockdown? maybe that, schools resorting back online social distancing well stores? 




This Delta variant seems dangerous spreading like wild fire literally getting vaccinated sick, makes sense. still catch spread virus. ask covid ready move on. found story: got extremely low chance catching vaccinated. unlikely get it, point even STILL, get it, even then, even LESS likely kind serious illness. 

Being vaccinated COVID, scared more. want prevent even potentially getting mild illness (incidentally, COVID) wearing mask well certainly reduce chances even more. Fauci trust science

-anti maskers spamming sub last month one important parts. However, also important know effective vaccines preventing vaccinated person spreading Delta covid-19 people, even case mild. think know enough yet. feel this. feel college students. go back person teach university wearing mask risk son home 2. university requiring vaccines masks, protect son reccomended pediatrician. I'm Florida surging. 

My graduation canceled May. Half master's program online. sucked honestly thought we'd better place now. hell couple days I‚Äôm feeling way better. Thanks!  generally produced hybridomas pretty cool. select harness advantage immortal myeloma cancer lines keep producing desired Yeah, made announcement, less half adult population one shot. poorly timed, one month director cried potential fourth wave.

I wonder they're crying now. No, point need get everyone vaccinated avoid selective shutdowns particularly riskier activities mask requirements.

Much California forced reimposing vaccination rates sufficient stop renewed onslaught. w county 80% vaxed then, then, drop mandate long becomes ""consideration recommendation"", I'm fine.

If becomes mandate again, we'll problems. Well get tested weekly also risk spreading covid. balancing risk infected vaccinated similar risk positive unvaccinated tested. 

Either way, they're telling workers either go weekly testing (which inconvenient) go vaccine save effort. case count time say much, need time series know dangerous.  wonder many counties go red blue next election result low vaccination rates, serious cases deaths. Mostly cdc mask update‚Ä¶. That's really case Texas. Many counties open availability long May. Whoever CDC made infamous decision end mask mandates needs fired Yup, unfortunately one 12% (based study), hope feeling better mend! definitely overstatement. said, last week 213 vaccinated individuals LA County hospitalized. ([Source](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/data/reopening-dashboard.htm).) That's 4122 vaccinated people tested positive Covid. Nearly 5 million people LA County vaccinated.

So vaccinated people inevitably hospitalized, data thus far suggest hospitalizations extraordinarily rare among vaccinated population. waited 3 weeks (Australia) people US obviously want vaccine, let's send do. piece shit

But course, he's NYPD cop!

What'd ya expect? Decency? Empathic, respectful treatment respect rule law ?

Nah, better luck stumbling across HOPE Diamond long ever happening. Exactly. true protection comes vaccinated population longer testing others resistance breakthrough, vs unvaxinated neighbours currently challenging - sometimes beating - individual resistance.

Being individually vaccinated unvaxinated population 5-10x better being, real protection rely comes getting together entire population. roughly half population vaccinated 95% claimed efficacy, right proportion unvaccinated cases.  that, Steve, ""lock whole world completely two weeks"" *not* sustainable way control virus.  Awesome! 
And intend keep way far I'm concerned. People densely populated areas Asia already worn masks covid, I'll future. never hear reporting Moderna vaccine, one got. good delta? Misinformation along, new wave mostly current admin's mismanagement.

Heck, believe admin still vastly better last. But, premature shifting tone, implying ""normalcy"" upon us, stupid. Zero covid realistic masks significantly impact college experience. Masks real social hindrance/barrier. Vaccines always billed way out, let‚Äôs move goalposts. 

Nothing 100% prevents infection anything. Life always risk. vaccine mitigates much covid risk, remaining risk falls line diseases normal life.  would many issues previous administration felt like practical joke country four years.

I take issue people removed platforms reason. fucking love idiocy people charge, like we‚Äôve correctly radicalised base propaganda absorb media, base doesn‚Äôt let‚Äôs convince base real, deadly virus hoax‚Ä¶ oh wait don‚Äôt base Hello, I‚Äôm meaning completely friendly way. really vaccine works? thought immune got shot? I‚Äôm alittle scared thought got it, covered. sounds like still catch covid? Would catching still allow mutate? Again, mean genuine friendly way. pandemic got scared slightly confused honesty.  fact many conservatives Republicans breaking norms encouraging vaccination also seems help lot. Why? reality young, healthy vaccinated safe. I'm 3 categories, PLUS got virus December...

 I'm going wear mask people vaccinated. I'm morons (excluding people can't actual reasons)

If becomes mandated, course, time move on.  like uk, cases going increase deaths going plateau much lower # previous waves, people stop freaking out. Give weeks. unfair require masks? vaccine prevents death, completely prevent infection. Wearing mask going impact person learning, that's like saying wearing pants impacts ability pay attention class. I'll gladly wear mask prevent variant mutating evade vaccine putting us square one again. mean influenced mass media social media? way!

Seriously, social media current ""news"" climate destroying country. provide credible unbiased source ABC news story it.

Truthfully, doubt particularly know several cops masters degrees

Many cops degrees masters degrees things like ""law enforcement."" Honestly, say huge amount intelligence. (Please downvote statement--I saying friends dumb.)

If want better cops better educated cops, recruiting people liberal arts degrees (e.g. physics, mathematics, history). purpose liberal arts education develop strong critical thinking skills. You‚Äôre one scared go outside he‚Äôs vaccinated I‚Äôm fragile one? I‚Äôm edgy, want wait pure herd immunity, happen 8 weeks 10 years, it‚Äôs us  12.49% vaccination rate zip code   Ho hum‚Ä¶ still yet see evidence masks work. Anyone scientific journal article link yet? want N95 KN95 respirators. calling medical personnel needed them. good supply. offer great protection others. take Dad ER due allergic reaction. like November again. Place packed wait hours long. Dad's okay got seen, discouraging see, especially go back outside store something one wearing masks. know either, assume issue previous administration things. 

In end, administration charge. fact Great Aunt Arlene posting demonstrable lies, knowingly not, might hurt kill people believe them. think Aunt Arlene thrown jail? No. think crap deleted account canceled? Yes. ‚ÄúThey cry,‚Äù Cobia wrote. ‚ÄúAnd tell didn‚Äôt know. thought hoax. thought political. thought certain blood type certain skin color wouldn‚Äôt get sick. thought ‚Äòjust flu.‚Äô wrong.‚Äù Sorry reading comprehension say that?

All said less viral circulation make people safer, never completely safe covid endemic cease exist anytime soon. ask people ""So COVID deaths India? Brazil? UK? Europe, Russia, every country globe? hell Fauci managed influence entire world even listen him?!""

These people astound me, live long life never understanding period life people inhabit it.  I'm disagreeing you. saying cdc could held little bit. Vaccines becoming easily accessible said ""no masks"". killed incentive said early. Nah   Well it‚Äôs great thing live 2000 miles away California, instead follow advice CDC state local health guidelines, none require wear mask daily circumstances. got J&amp;J back March, April
I got covid sick week. delta variant stuff kinda concerning im considering getting vaxx pfizer. ok? J&amp;J antibodies getting covid enough? trying get covid again. one week sick hell quote Groundhog Day, ""sometimes people die."" cannot completely protect death, vaccine tremendous job drastically reducing risk.  fully vaccinated, much higher risk dying something COVID, dying COVID. Magnitudes higher. Pfizer lower anti bodies? Isn‚Äôt conspiracy weirdo. one showed I‚Äôm curious provide credible unbiased source that? know several cops masters degrees. Police actively recruit law schools. setting false choice here.

It choice unmitigated spread matter local case levels, zero cases.  I'm extremely surprised requirement. Wow banned travelling outside Australia notice. would tell protection vaccine better natural infection I've worse side effects drinking many beers/too much whiskey vaccine.  colleges requiring vaccinations. would asinine frankly unfair also require masks.  Yeah gonna happen. Young healthy don‚Äôt kids yet. I‚Äôm purple area near 100% mask compliance year decent vax rates. ready move on. Time evaluate risk category make decisions yourself. comment replying removed. idiot claiming part plan permanent lockdowns *those* people vaccinated? got vaccine, much closer seatbelt airbags metaphor. Masks fully vaccinated young healthy person really much. Exsactly. People thinking children ""acceptable risk"". worry son's every time step outside home days. ""I'd rather die get vaccine I'm afraid might kill someday."" I‚Äôm Feeling pretty good that! thought least partially confirmed low risk long Covid fully Ah yes ‚Äòtruth‚Äô decide reduce efficacy vaccine 7%, claim UK fully vaccinated using AZ (actually split 1/3 Pfizer, 2/3 AZ Pfizer percentage due increase younger age groups). also decided add uninformed opinion 60% (should 67%) isn‚Äôt good effective, I‚Äôm sure qualifies ‚Äòtruth‚Äô. 

Given little actually said thing got close accurate UKs fully vaccinated percentage reduced 3.4%. suppose congratulate least.

Basically similar lot comments I‚Äôve read, excuse criticise AZ vaccine UK largely lying greatly exaggerating. get extra points caught rare variants? Two top questions breakthrough cases have:

1. infectious people breakthrough cases?

2. percentage breakthrough cases result hospitalization / death? (Even ballpark figure do, seen far 'very rare'. rare?)

After reading article, continue two top questions answers... true lol

Hope find better (and encouraging) answers able give! Oh wow guess assumed pulled together &amp; got cases zero meant everyone would jump get vaccine. Totally understand concern. Eventually someone bring you..   obviously doctor, remember asked checklist organ transplant... guess depends condition has. 

But someone one two countries land border UK, worry well delta. lot! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*      Ah, see. Thanks letting know! alright, know topic came another thread subreddit like month ago lol

But answer question actually twofold. First, tell someone let know actually certain margin error mutations could supposedly change makeup spike protein without actually losing effectiveness skeleton key. However, I'm aware either Delta Gamma actually particular kind mutation. like saying, there's still far virus could take mutation completely loses usefulness spike.

Second, remember normal vaccines advantage mRNA, usually take dead virus cells, inject body, try get white blood cells recognize intruder. Whereas mRNA bit targeted. normal vaccines, there's lot wiggle room virus mutations work with.

Other tho, I'm actually know what's going area. LOOOL European visitors important us.

right know people flat earthers irl? one? even change one's mind getting vaccinated know will. deadly gamma compared alpha? Strange. 
I thought vaccine end all? know virus lot airborne initially thought think face shields pretty useless Exactly this. can't believe we're even considering boosters third world countries enough vaccines even 1% population. 

We boost want, sooner later new variant send us back start pandemic. Really Sherlock? Wear mask use carrageenan nasal spray instead? much convenient wearing mask, according research might much effective, especially compared kind ordinary/non-medical masks people typically wear. Maybe thinks pushback breakthrough infections highly unlikely? Science hard people worry. assuming everyone vaxxed group exposed Covid, unlikely. That's need control group contrast with. Noo piece cloth oppressing me

Wait learn pants also cloth restricting them. mitigated risk still includes everyone. Every time new person infected, virus gets chance mutation. reopen 0 cases.

lol feel workers. one hand, could forced work someone knowingly infected, hand, could forced work seem like government cares enough pay stay home. 

We something similar shut everything part essential workers go work. thankfully avoided outbreaks know full year able get vaccine. masks kids go back normal.



What part cases tripled go thick skull? think everyone enjoys putting face masks? People trying fuckin die, imbecile.  That‚Äôs fairly good description !  Look chart:  contend right call it‚Äôs unfortunate next step need take pressure people get vaccinated. aren‚Äôt afforded luxury letting remain ignorant unvaccinated. many people dying hard say, next wave going young‚Ä¶ someone wouldn‚Äôt get vaccine? careful poke pooh guess people health issues due fault covered It‚Äôs like first paragraph 

Clapton previously shared message ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù health experience receiving Covid-19 vaccine Monotti‚Äôs Telegram page.) hope people understand every breakthrough case opportunity COVID learn mutate around vaccine. Darn anti-vax unfortunately problem also ours. (So double darn tbh)

Note: anti-vax, unvaxable
Edit: used civil language thank auto mod understanding vaccination dramatically reduces risk levels infection.  Wait thought China's pocket? could even suggest thing?

/s Also ancestors go could socialize lol... nerd know. feel way. statistically even driving day day maybe 95% safe. There's always 5% chance accident. vulnerable people around also wondering 95% safe reasonably risk like driving daily? I'm torn also. hard assess risks perspective. Same. got second moderna shot relief real, especially mental one. sub since January 2020 constant anxiety really took toll me. glad bullshit finally family since everyone got jab. people, wearing mask burdensome all.

For example, honestly cannot feel difference respiration well fitted N95 mask (because medical condition nose). would wear long still lot cases area? Definitely hero. Thank service Thank service got Feb/March. got waiting list since opened people chronic illnesses. go multi county vaccine hub, terribly far. Guess wants audience's request list ""Tears Heaven"". Taiwan easily register willingness get vaccinated, half people know still waiting notified. LAUSD requiring students. üëç LoL. Since Florida ever follow mask rules?  big actually catching virus missing competition entirely That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. I've kept wearing mine well. I'm usually person mask everywhere go state leading country (again) new cases Delta variant easily transmissible I'm keeping on. government wiping hands passing responsibility smaller governments. keep saying this. Vaccinated people still catch, carry, transmit virus others. That‚Äôs still wear mask everywhere. 6 year old daughter can‚Äôt vaccinated. wears mask everywhere too. Israel strong vaccination rate adults still virus spreading there. UK too. vaccine enough stop delta completely. Wearing mask going back world mutually exclusive. think vaccinated people staying hermits going way overboard. nothing wrong wearing masks things going right now.  Talk ssssstttttttrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeettttttttttttccccccccchhhhhhh Wow that‚Äôs horrible. take elder/at-risk interaction pretty seriously, I‚Äôll isolate prior seeing older relatives. 

It‚Äôs easy it‚Äôs irregular ‚Äî need get takeout week mask get tested visit. It‚Äôs time, like you. 

You making huge sacrifice right thing, it‚Äôs truly awful time line work. Hannity said Fauci helped create COVID. One step forward, one innocent man condemned. literally make 2 day trip drive 6 ways hours get first shot. people get free vaccine across street?

Come people. says happened hospitalized people, vaccine decreases chances dramatically worry  seriously can't believe people downvoted you. domt understand what's controversial said. ""might want consider"" already fair number modifiers briefly convey necessary.  Used eternal reward title says understand knock that, there's good chunk people websites acting holier thou people vaccinated resumed lives. type stigma really suck especially us everything needed year got vaccinated feeling safe enough go back world, mental health needs it. Yes, it‚Äôs *extremely* unlikely unless highest risk groups (very elderly immune compromised) didn‚Äôt build proper immune reaction vaccine. breakthrough infections asymptomatic, rest mild moderate. end hospitalized again, typically people multiple underlying health issues. endpoint (beginning point actually) use really problematic makes impossible actually interpret means. People reported died February would infected January, virtually one access vaccine. Also lag reporting, people reported died March would really died February infected January. probably go even - takes 5-6 weeks first shot ‚Äúfully‚Äù vaccinated (wait second shot, two weeks). 

There‚Äôs doubt vaccine reduces deaths infections - quick look UK‚Äôs cases deaths ratio shows clear day. makes sense include February/March deaths calculation, people vaccinated then. 

Since early June, people would access shots reporting lag accounted for, ~2,000 total reported deaths. That‚Äôs better reference period. 

That still shows effective efficacy, stretching truth including inapplicable winter numbers unnecessary. I‚Äôm sorry fully vaccinated MRNA vaccine prior infection? I‚Äôve watching reports think I‚Äôve seen couple case long Covid healthy person post-vaccination.  know he's vaccinated? Plenty vaccinated people absolutely done masking up. ain't happening again, learn adapt consequences allow people die covid year. bet you‚Äôre popular parties! 

I mean, you‚Äôre totally correct damn, put way‚Ä¶ Thank sharing. means lot me. Hang there! Try savor small things. Yeah, LA great vaccination rates moment :( 

I lived NOLA definitely struggled access healthcare. It‚Äôs amazing place great people tons challenges, without COVID.  Meh, needs concerts 80-year-old musicians covering 30-year-old selves? Going high school anxiety considered dropping, getting GED, moving onto college several times. really support home go normal path like successful. school face going back ""free"" year can't say I'd complacent. 

If I'd known much better college would gone route too. realized I'm actually extrovert, high school really awful, interesting conversation campus time went looking one. daughter sounds like got good head shoulders could thrive path. 

Idk. know y'all none business. hindsight always feel like missed opportunity like let people know option can. encourage enough internet strangers give enough anncidotal information maybe useful someone. 

I feel guys. There's lot great decisions make here, sounds like best. past year scary confusing. many Republican anti vaccination anti maskers ? point solution then? doubt good chunk people would fine forgoing seeing loved ones indefinitely sorry hear Same. 31% county. counted 5 people wearing mask including myself, grocery store week coworkers already mocking people wear masks buildings. Masking new religion here. Tldr; old people definitely wear masks public. 

I think vaccine‚Äôs powers bit overstated, eagerness sell public. Don‚Äôt get wrong, absolutely fucking miracles modern medicine. 

But aren‚Äôt literal magic, limitations. think breakthrough cases far common people think )and I‚Äôve downvoted hell time I‚Äôve mentioned months). 65 year old blood thinners carrying extra weight, still get pretty sick. won‚Äôt die that‚Äôs really great. still bad time. 

If older person isn‚Äôt digging literature following news, could easily think totally safe. feel like misled‚Ä¶ hand many people dismissed risk factors entire pandemic. Friends tell me, ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm young healthy‚Äù I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyou elevated blood pressure, you‚Äôre obese, allergies. Plenty stuff Covid exploit.‚Äù also much ""extra mile"" if, like me, really mind masking much, forget time.

I'm overjoyed vaccinated (I big ol' grin got second shot), feel well protected vaccine.

But mask may increase protection bit, would also help protect others case unknowingly get breakthrough infection. since take much effort part, I'm happy keep it. mother went ER stroke symptoms immediately seen everyone else. Turns Bell's Palsy us know. Definitely ""nothing"" much better stroke. city tap water staying hydrated enough.

That‚Äôs heck catch-22. huge chunk spread private gatherings forsee much effect mandates tbh. 

Workplace spread might improve masks, nothing else imo done part we‚Äôve done risk assessments.

Say assuredly super scientific risk assessment wrong. would take put big boy pants mask follow restrictions?

The one's sound scared people like you. want end. love pull ""iF ScArEd, StAy InSiDe"" actually want shit continue. I've stuck home nearly year half high risk 4 yo. Trust me, want out.

However, viruses going stop virus shit I'm breakdown. I'm going ignore basic facts viruses justify continuing like normal. 

I've ever seen people sub advocating mask mandates continue kids vaccinated. Which, even agree, still reasonable position someone take. Yet every single damn time people ever hear ""IWANNASTAYINSIDEFOREVERHOLYSHITI'MTERRIFIED"" say we're scared.

Holy hell stop projecting fear onto us. There's difference scared cautious.  many refusing mask/vaccinate make progress. state tried ~~everything~~ little increase vaccinations.

Again. me. others. Nobody said masks stop pandemics. do, however, lower risk catch it, lower amount virus breathe in, reduce symptoms catch it. Edit: importantly, people around wearing mask. It‚Äôs primarily help people, makes sense many people refuse wear country selfish people.

In news, wearing seat belt won‚Äôt stop car accident, even dying one. suppose don‚Äôt wear either. Great, give numbers ""very low risk"" whether that's Delta would settled. thing people fully vaccinated, yet spreading anti-vax misinformation. want get first dose two get second dose next gen vaccine great immune response it. really can‚Äôt judge immune response vaccines side effects triggered. one things brought medical team rather subreddit. doctors may able order antibody test (you need certain type help determine post-vaccine immunity.) Looks like gots reader! good advice there, rejected it. sources follow religiously spew dangerous, unending lies, shown little inclination changing plans.

Therein lies problem. They're brainwashed. They've indoctrinated believe fully confidently ""liberal media"" lying it. bad people, misled. federal mask mandates are/were control - transit via DOT interstate commerce clause, (when/where effect) federal buildings/property.

The rest guidance states something.

Or often not, whimp anything time. they're reporting severely low transmission rates vaccination. low contracting rates. also effective delta variant. trust science. Weve feeling anti maskers beginning would go science now? think thought dropping mask mandates would incentivize holdouts. Silly CDC thinking stubborn people would change minds. term disinformation.

The media needs start using it. Thanks sharing source. I've looking health dept tracking breakthroughs. interesting based raw numbers breakthroughs found link ""Post-vaccination Infections Overall"" looks like little 4,000 breakthroughs 7 days ending July 13th.

For 7 day rolling average ending 7/13 looks like 15,000 cases.

A little quick math 4k/15k = 26% 7 day rolling average positive cases breakthroughs... points July 6th - 2822/9693 29.1%

There's ton folks LA rocking mask understand. seems like really high breakthrough rate. agree sentiment. we're boat. agree stop rowing boat. done civil duty. going beyond even noble help us get want sooner. choice blame either way.   risk death children small.

Inslee would instill mask mandate, don‚Äôt ‚Äúparanoid one‚Äù office. don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm going look n95s amazon, surgical ones home use everything excluding work. test positive COVID, virus present sufficient concentrations; people test positive right they've exposed, virus started use cells reproduce.

For lot breakthrough cases, what's really happening people good immune systems may get much benefit vaccine. one extreme, imagine someone basically immune response; since vaccine prepares immune system fight off, there's nothing prepare, anything.

So lot breakthrough cases happened elderly immunocompromised. People get much benefit vaccine, even though got it. (and they're depending everyone else vaccinated they're much less likely exposed virus since may able get benefit taking vaccine personally)

Lots websites claim legit, one tell really?

It would seem self protective masks permanent staple American life now. Excellent masks cheap plentiful yet neither. What‚Äôs going here? Don‚Äôt know told that, they‚Äôre wrong.

To somewhat defend (as seemed honest question), original phrase II/III study clinical trial, least Pfizer-BioNTech, monitored symptoms (and would pick anyone needed hospitalization), involve checking participants see infected showing symptoms.

So study came out, researchers correctly said able show significant reduction symptoms hospitalizations, mean study shown people getting infected. Unfortunately, lot bad media coverage represented ""the vaccine prevent getting infected"" rather ""we data yet vaccine prevents getting infected"".

Later studies *did* look show infection rates also drop significantly, confusion often stems bad coverage early researchers claim could prove, ""infected asymptomatic"" ""not infected"" distinguished initial wide clinical trial.

The sources quoted seem hedging pretty heavily.

Obviously hope true. Long term symptoms proof strength!  Delta variant ""pass"" US? mean this: first showed India April, Delta cases getting low there. took 3-4 months Delta ""pass"" there.

Now first thought take amount time US, can't really compare India US. think we'll Delta storm September something like that? gonna longer that? No. that's dumb argument make.

Anecdotally, I've heard way cases breakthrough infections since delta started cropping up. makes sense given variant much effective replicating. effective virus changes baseline. Before, vaccine pretty good keeping getting sick all. staying hospital. that's new baseline, even vaccinated people reservoirs spread covid (unwittingly).

And mask work well. Maybe forever certainly long time. care others think. reason vaccinated folks keep following measures, get infected? bad news think avoid getting infected.

The goal help keep spread low among unvaccinated, stop vaccinated getting sick. Unfortunately, think that's lot confusion comes in. 

The way completely avoid COVID basically check public life, simply wear mask public? perspective vaccinated people safe person normal flu season, low chance risk merit extraordinary action. valid argument, although side merit too.

Maybe rank 1-5 level risk based vaccination rates positivity rate county. would line clear message well incorporating nuance. Right now, overall feel like getting unclear mixed messages: CDC currently recommend vaccinated people wear masks, may want to. What?

Maybe part problem science clear yet whether vaccinated people wearing masks significant impact spread Delta variant. get learning information time moves along. feels like recommendations suddenly change without clear communicated criteria decision. sudden announcement vaccinated people done pandemic near impossible walk back, need arise like possibly now. political push back help.

I suspect mostly angry news sensationalizing science report click bait. remember back articles coming particle physics scientists measured neutrinos moving faster life. headlines asked physics beyond standard model relativity. paper essentially begged community figure made mistake calculations.

BACKGROUND

The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), virus causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), contributed surge cases India detected across globe, including notable increase cases United Kingdom. effectiveness BNT162b2 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines variant unclear.

METHODS

We used test-negative case‚Äìcontrol design estimate effectiveness vaccination symptomatic disease caused delta variant predominant strain (B.1.1.7, alpha variant) period delta variant began circulating. Variants identified use sequencing basis spike (S) gene status. Data symptomatic sequenced cases Covid-19 England used estimate proportion cases either variant according patients‚Äô vaccination status.

RESULTS

Effectiveness one dose vaccine (BNT162b2 ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) notably lower among persons delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 35.7) among alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 51.7); results similar vaccines. BNT162b2 vaccine, effectiveness two doses 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 95.3) among persons alpha variant 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 90.1) among delta variant. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, effectiveness two doses 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 79.4) among persons alpha variant 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 71.8) among delta variant.

CONCLUSIONS

Only modest differences vaccine effectiveness noted delta variant compared alpha variant receipt two vaccine doses. Absolute differences vaccine effectiveness marked receipt first dose. finding would support efforts maximize vaccine uptake two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded Public Health England.) Reports people asking vaccine they‚Äôre hospitalized somehow entirely new level ‚Äúwow, education system really failed people‚Äù and/or people beyond clueless.

and article revised since initial release. Since one ‚Äúmuch‚Äù anything? you‚Äôre vaccinated do? vaccines effective masks. point, people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated option so. they‚Äôre paying price decision. that‚Äôs right, solution go back place restrictions us again?

The virus never go away, mask everyone vaccinated? many people don‚Äôt want too, we‚Äôll never reach 100%. So, people criticizing others asking ‚ÄúWhy continue protecting don‚Äôt want protection?‚Äù what‚Äôs solution? Unfortunately scholarships contingent upon finishing 4 years. quite literally can‚Äôt afford year off. I‚Äôm stuck shitty subpar experience.   mean, might, can, maybe get struck lightning get hit car, doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt go outside?

The reason I‚Äôm asking something definitive it‚Äôs helpful quantify chances happening. thought sub valued data.

I don‚Äôt think asking definitive data claim unreasonable, right?  one find number hospitalizations fully vaccinated folks? think they're hoping vaccinated campus community without masks.

It depend degree interaction host community, disease dynamics there. also formal informal interaction schools.

A practical goal may turn mask requirement based trends they're seeing. Many wish *wanted* late. Pick risk point. Vaccines far less risk catching covid cooties unmitigated. Especially people wearing poorly fitting cloth masks. 

If you‚Äôre worried catching virus you‚Äôre wearing anything properly fitted N95 (or least snug KN95) idea you‚Äôre doing. Yeah, because, know, group private, means Facebook absolutely way read anything it. Like all. Because...uhm...pinky promise! /s incompetence cannot access article, would expect cases hospitalization vaccines part broken chain infections (cases) hospitalization. 

If folks ending hospital mostly unvaccinated proves vaccines work, also explains positive cases hospitalizations.  Exactly this. state 56% one shots yet see maybe 10% people wearing one (none rural places) never trusted people got even one shot.

Now comes I'm thankful continued wear one, aside weird looks getting even month ago. Manitoba first lottery.  Yes. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt look early study original strain done full protocols expect numbers exactly later point time. They‚Äôre great general figure, personally also go things like positivity rates I‚Äôm deciding comfortable feel traveling, eating indoors/outdoors, etc. 

Delta worse expected, I‚Äôm keep closer eye things anticipated point.  cyclical vomiting disease frequently go ER for. Covid, would wait hours, usually last one seen elderly adults came problem. Trouble breathing, chest pains, etc. Since signs Covid something else always last. cognitive decline would ask questions identify stroke (what year it, president) would respond yes. Many times, nothing would see come in, seen, discharged me. 

There lot fighting, tears, begging relief nothing helped. loud, reaching coming parked intake desk. like people try understand science way, instead way science learned taught everyone else.  developed mcas probably asymptomatic covid. told wait vaccine fda approved get would probably make symptoms worse. true? Personally, might, can, maybe chances would like take brain.  wouldn‚Äôt even dare say it‚Äôs lesser one, tests effectiveness done different timeframes different variants. thought vaccine never stopped getting covid

Don‚Äôt know told that, they‚Äôre wrong. vaccine absolutely reduce chance contracting Covid-19. 

Basically, viral particles enter body immune system recognizes eliminates faster able start reproducing. 

No reproduction build virus illness shedding virus chance spread others. 

Some people don‚Äôt respond strongly vaccine. immune system doesn‚Äôt identify virus quickly, allowing start reproduce. immune response sufficiently slow weak (and amount viral particles you‚Äôre initially exposed sufficiently high), result innate immune system responding, symptoms experience like fever coughing. continues reproduce without stopped might sever enough symptoms result hospitalization death.  Asking vaccine already intensive care unit like asking sprinkler system installed house house already fire. I'd wonder taking year something else rather pay Zoom-U show lies Fox News pushed? saw telling people get vaccinated. links lies? Older people weaker immune systems seeing cases earlier ‚Äúolder population ‚Äú. Reasons everyone given boosters shots Read post carefully. source even say anything definitively? Respectfully, I‚Äôm seeing ‚Äúmaybe,‚Äù ‚Äúcan,‚Äù ‚Äúmight‚Äù cause‚Ä¶  Israel updated findings clarify selection bias means vaccine protection rate almost certainly overestimated. understandable  Eh, no. left devices, COVID spread exponentially East Asia. look spread within Shincheonji cult early last year. Korea went one two cases thousands matter two weeks. virus brought control nearly universal mask wearing aggressive contact tracing, well limited social distancing policies (closing churches gyms). Japan, also intense mask usage, seriously reduces rate reproduction, along stay home orders case growth becomes exponential. 

What case East Asia tells us mask wearing aggressive testing tracing regime could saved hundreds thousands lives implemented earlier US Europe. Seems like colleges going mandating vaccines keeping testing hopes maintain masks.

Though plan ultimately contingent trajectory epidemic. Actually, there's active research [universal coronavirus well [universal flu Neither likely ready next year two research goes well, possibly 5-10 years timeframe (although maybe I'm overly optimistic here). know flu spreads droplets.  friends cowards, sorry say it. ‚ÄúI afraid current Israeli [ministry health] analysis cannot used safely assess it, one way another,‚Äù tweeted Uri Shalit, senior lecturer Technion‚ÄìIsrael Institute Technology, pointing numerous confounding variables study account could explain results. study not, example, consider potential differences vaccinated unvaccinated people, Shalit said, might differ willingness get tested Covid-19 adherence public health guidance like social distancing mask wearing. Weintraub, also professor medicine Brigham Women‚Äôs Hospital, told Forbes agrees assessment, though stressed studies indicate vaccine ‚Äústill highly effective‚Äù ‚Äúreinforce importance second dose fend Delta variant.‚Äù  see this? know non symptomatic infection still contagious? exactly problem. Suddenly ONE wearing mask know half knuckle draggers around aren‚Äôt vaccinated. won‚Äôt stop wearing double mask over-over. agree lot people selfish past year time, there‚Äôs factors play avoiding getting Covid: economy, mental health, social educational development children etc.

If looking solely public health standpoint, yes: Australia approach would make sense. 

However, don‚Äôt way ensure whole country would comply even did, don‚Äôt money support people businesses several months lockdowns, without sending country lot debt. 

Also, really smart make policy based hope people unlimited patience? go: sure understand vaccination rates least 80% everywhere. people friends relatives get sick even die this. rare takes weeks Pfizer send paperwork. knows sent in. know solution Covid. think masks handwashing protocol could help. However, many breakthrough cases Covid rely vaccine. Observations. Date collected.

I‚Äôm assuming still provided free charge? need insurance card. Thinking seeing elderly parents weeks, fully vaxxed want get test safe, haven‚Äôt done though get hearing checked.  Also, consider one dose vaccinated, single dose protective, especially Delta variant. 

It could also people got infected right first dose, time develop immunity.

Considering time frame, (February) could factors. Yeah 2020 changed perspective little, think people forgot getting cold sucked. used wear masks music festivals even covid everyone got fucking sick after.

My rule thumb news is, scary probably half true! many doesn‚Äôt paint full picture. 

I work high-risk position. Several friends well. We‚Äôre vaccinated. tested positive due regular mandatory testing, never *any* symptoms neither families (many unvaccinated minors). 10-day isolation, tested negative, went back work. doesn‚Äôt really matter kinds breakthrough cases happen stops chain. passing covid, symptoms. That‚Äôs want vaccines do. want vaccines fight virus effectively never show symptoms don‚Äôt pass on. 

That said, there‚Äôs difference 30yo childcare worker tests positive, remains asymptomatic, doesn‚Äôt pass family, compared 80yo breakthrough case symptoms needs hospitalized. We‚Äôre trying stop latter, former pretty much goal. may weird say legitimately think people don‚Äôt understand need get vaccines PRIOR exposure (in cases, think things like rabies vaccine get post exposure don‚Äôt think people realize mean there‚Äôs chance doesn‚Äôt take...)

I think earnestly need basic education campaign around things: 1) vaccine must prior exposure won‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs treatment option, it‚Äôs pretreatment option. 2) many immunocompromised folks folks existing medical conditions able get vaccine, especially MRNA version. 3) it‚Äôs free freeeeeeeeeeeee. believe last strained, clawing gasp. show article explain immune system go long process delta variant future variant, potentially losing valuable time letting virus take deadly hold.

With vaccines, verify antibodies getting work new variant, work variant, tweak vaccine antibody give booster variant.

You know antibodies body specifically came effective variants. control possible antigen target natural immunity using. hundreds possibilities mutate time. concern breakthrough infections (the patient likely fine) every infection chance vaccine resistant mutation. 
It starts unlikely, get 1 million cases/week odds start stack up. Okay. Good answer, guess.

Thankfully, odds still quite low kids get sick it, especially transmission rates suppressed vaccine. family, masks worth anymore, especially considering grief get living area exactly majority favor masks. respect decision too. one hospital every reason covid patients allowed procedures happen heart attacks etc treated. People exposed covid need dialysis. Full FDA approval would help lot think. Plus vaccines full approval schools businesses start making mandatory.  Silly downvote. understanding Moderna Pfizer use type mRNA technology. used primed mRNA. CureVac technology using native mRNA. somehow got around problem using native mRNA way (that understand), good enough seems. Yeah I'm mostly worried bc kids I‚Äôm sure. thought heard somewhere experiment two doses eventually scrapped idea made little difference (at least time). Also I‚Äôm pretty sure J&amp;J finished development later AZ. AZ got major authorization use December 2020 J&amp;J didn‚Äôt February-March 2021 study delta variant though? please, share.

Honestly I'm point care more. took covid seriously cared society before. past 4 years especially 2020... think more.

The kids going suffer stupidity adults. based overly cautious. that's it.

And that's fine, people. 

For part need data first. still trust experts this, right people study things say risk incredibly low. variants actually start demonstrating widespread vaccine resistance, I'll change behavior again. right things normal, enjoy lasts. mean sound insensitive, forgive do. think vaccine definitely job lot ""covid resurgence hype"" is, technically true, largely product traditional news media trying cling last big wave covid fear clicks views.

If want put mind ease, simply google hard covid numbers compare time last year. Also see like 95% hospitalizations unvaccinated people. (I know exact stat probably Google it. crazy high). Also transmission rate vaccinated people super low

Hope helps! Yeah ‚Äúwear mask others‚Äù business bad advice now. stopped wearing cloth masks last summer able find *self* protective masks.

We need access affordable, self protective masks. Delta wont last. Work, food, etc necessities survive. Going gym recreational thing. Also, people gym sweating equipment, breathing heavy, running around touching equipment others touch regularly. Puts higher risk infection imo. Yup, I'm still wearing mask 10 year old can't get vaccinated. family unnamed clotting issue. clot really fast. cousin's 12 year old kid died Covid ended ton clots everywhere.

I'm forced face risk even mild case Covid could kill enough trigger clotting issue Covid already causes its' own. Sweden passed 75% adults least one dose, soon pass 50% fully vaccinated (currently 47.6% adults fully vaccinated). Polls show 90% eligible population intends get vaccinated.

Everybody 18+ get vaccinated since weeks ago. Vaccinations open 16+ well 12+ comorbities August.

Age distribution found (in Swedish). Sure look guilty I'm saying agreed it, reasonable argument.

Personally think lockdowns make sense point believe keep mask mandates. went last year, can't stomach :( Require proof vaccination/negative test things like go school/work, shopping, eating restaurants. 

Make well known contagious Delta variant is. Delta variant 10-times infectious original SARS virus. put real terms, back got infected March 2020 original virus, would closed space within three four feet someone 10 minutes assured picking infection. Delta variant, contact one minute, maybe little less, you‚Äôll pick virus. don‚Äôt think public quite understood yet, we‚Äôre finding real vaccine shouldn‚Äôt politicized. 

Get false info TV/social media.  Treat others want treated. antivaxxer fools care anyone themselves. Hell... even care themselves... vaccine *their best interest*. care them.

I'll save empathy someone actually cares people. It‚Äôs ashame nobody advocates living healthy lifestyles don‚Äôt condemn obesity etc. get vaccine rather live healthily guess  Nah.

Like learning new skill someone knows how, vaccines let immune systems learn others, rather trial error. time saved saves lives.

Vaccines created researching existing cases illness immune response find keys fighting new invaders. vaccines hand keys unexposed people's immune system immediately.  would mad doctor talking officer without release information. thinking another lockdown even thinking one let alone anything masking 

I think much way lockdowns US... Whether different thing  That‚Äôs what‚Äôs different vaccines. flu also uses spike protein. 

The spike protein looks kind like penis. flu vaccines, targeted ‚Äúhead‚Äù spike protein. changes rapidly.

Anyone wants vaccine get point people decided to. protect people? I'm sorry go giving birth. say working. majority cases tested testing sites symptomatic people go. majority symptomatic people tested fully vaccinated. can't find English option Icelandic articles, site lot good Anti-vaxxers care virus mutates around vaccine since intention getting first place. heard someone say day better get vaccinated people get whatever variant bypasses vaccine, anti-vaxxers get normal covid believe dangerous. literally think kill liberals letting virus mutate.  also got moderna. weak hell fever 4 days. drainage lung issues. thing going tell people go extra mile give right fucking information. vulnerable people go cloth masks isnt going shit current no-mask environment even infectious Delta Variant. 

These people need N95's infected largely unmasked. Otherwise giving false sense security telling use mask feel safe. feel better solely due existence vaccines. Even though delta variant exists, it‚Äôs shown better chance vaccine body fighting variant vaccine body fighting it. I‚Äôd rather something similar side effects taking shot struggling breathe isolated hospital room possibly thinking end.

I‚Äôm feeling we‚Äôre entering similar stage usually stuff like flu people probably take shot every year don‚Äôt. Sadly Covid, probably don‚Äôt luxury hands like flu flu there‚Äôs Tamiflu given detected early. Perhaps reach point we‚Äôll truly ‚Äújust like flu‚Äù scenarios.

This people suck take vaccine probably lives next couple years better treatment comes. mixed response vaccine now, assumed continue.   fuck doing? It‚Äôs one study. It‚Äôs studies, except mystery data Israel panicking without actually releasing they‚Äôve analyzing. published journal articles it. That‚Äôs point. Facebook browsing doesn‚Äôt count. honestly sure ever happen. One thing virus uncanny ability mutate. think minimum take yearly boosters seeing pretty shit turnout far. everyone upset piece fabric are. he‚Äôs not. 88% 1st dose UK

69% 2nd dose.


Our infection rate rising, deaths lagging significantly relative previous infection spikes. 


The infection rate approximately 1st Jan 2021. However, death rate 600 daily average versus 50 daily average now. 


Basically less 10% previous mortality rate thanks vaccination. 


Astonishing places US poor vaccination. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. Even delta, risk Covid children miniscule isolating rest world detrimental orders magnitude.  blame people losing shit. FFS, get vaccinated. vaccinated fine. not, loss. saw results current COVID-19 season. Didn‚Äôt seem trick it? one talking about. 

Also pretty sure lockdowns played part low flu numbers. Hard get sick you‚Äôre working home kids learning home parents schools FB group says it‚Äôs scientifically proven masks don‚Äôt work. believe? /s here. God could hope.

It would make carefree one night stands.  vaccinated. bad reaction. Evidently lot didn‚Äôt know. wish didn‚Äôt. Cream fan since childhood. Interesting, what's ""the covid"" feel like? wonder 'medical professional' want work obese people, drug addicts, smokers, etc. busy judging people maybe work another profession. Never stopped wearing one. Same, got mine May I've taken last 2 days work. Went mostly sinuses lungs today. Got tested couple days ago daughter brought home. I'm boat here, vaccinated unvaccinated kids. I'm exactly sure lady wearing mask would diffierent outcomes.

The CDC made decision back May pretty much game masks.Had lady wore mask would likely cloth mask basically useless protecting infection, especially Delta. science around masks wore protect others you. one store wearing cloth mask shit protect infected people around unmasked. useless security blanket point.

In current unmasked environment infectious Delta variant, unless using N95 respirator cloth mask useless theater plain simple.

&amp;#x200B;

We CDC anti-vaxxers thank current round shit show now. Wow, he's sacrificial patriot taking stand on...

What advocating? I‚Äôm sorry painful side effects, ended, he‚Äôs alive - unlike John Prine. Primary schools UK never mask mandates. here! knew people would take advantage that.

It‚Äôs something like 99%. reason vax would show solidarity something dumb. unvaccinated ppl, virus mutate. deadlier delta lambda variants bc issue.

Some ppl can‚Äôt get vaccinated: cancer patients, HIV ppl, children, etc. vaccinated, put innocent ppl risk getting virus.

Come fvck on, 2 years counting shite. Would least read gd factual article abt it.

I‚Äôm almost 72 hours fever calmed bit, chest muscle pain moved forearms it‚Äôs painful. 

I‚Äôve heard side effects last 1-2 day, I‚Äôm starting worry bit. could see writing wall shit 3 weeks ago, folks concerned labeled 'fear mongers' spread word. socialize people don‚Äôt infect family disease, bunch stupid red necks. think got facts wrong. think really extra mile all. lot countries still require masks indoors public places - cost low, gain significant. *Edgy teenager joined battle* TW surplus least rest year case, we‚Äôre never dropping masks there‚Äôs always risk use Jet Blue, I'm good.   Yeah terrible, they've little lockdown little deaths. Must nice live America deaths think fine symptom-wise since work healthcare would least get tested. It‚Äôs I‚Äôm sure good PCR Tests differentiating COVID-19 that‚Äôs completely neutralized vaccine‚Äôs antibodies asymptomatic breakthrough infection mean, Florida dropped mandate back. difference vaccinated choice drop masks. KF94/N95 protect wearer near 100% efficacy. honest vaccine came figured 80% would lower end point. unpleasantly surprised state stalling around 60% that‚Äôs actually really good compared others.  K? Well, 7 children end hospitalized Mississippi delta variant. 2 put ICU. I'm mandated wear mask work despite full vaccination. Fucking bullshit, done shit People love outraged lazy spend minutes read beyond headline. joke sub Reminder ask , people dealing complicated dangerous problem, likely complex well organized secret plan executed, people trying right thing always get right, hindsight? 

 Conspiracy theories give way much credit organizational ability people think get them. proves he's awful human being. He's white supremacist too.  mind, vaccine available able refused take it, get bed expense persons need icu dumbasses. study vs infection, UK study symptomatic infections.

I'm opinion ""asymptomatic infection"" fully vaccinated individual count case.

Even unvaccinated individual, asymptomatic PCR positive confirmed antibody test count, realize that's probably impractical logistical perspective.

All PCR test detecting presence virus particles nasal mucosa. exposed infected person, inhaling air they've expelled, likely test positive short period time. mean infection taken hold, develop symptoms, capable infecting anyone else. vaccine sort impenetrable barrier instantly inactivates virus particles contact body. started going back gym nobody wears masks.

Ok makes sense! vaccine 100% perfect, giving people better protection it, enough people say 80% protection vaccine (just throwing number there. sure you‚Äôd quantify protection vaccine) eventually probability spread/illness becomes low it‚Äôs negligible risk? Already seen breakthroughs vaccines..... believe news... especially companies NY does. used events little bit opened everything live place health care socialized still ask doctor EVERY health decision. remember one time nurse looked funny asked doctor something I'm like bro work hospital, doctor limited time I'm gonna pester takes 2 doses high percentage entire population infected. live mine stayed too. Yes little bit common sense dash collaboration really would mostly thing past. realize lack Desire collaborate comes one party states dominated party White House messaging time embraced lifting restrictions levels, including re-opening schools. idea vaccines easily available US.

Yeah, city every chain drugstore (and supermarket drugstores) offering vaccines. walked one drugstore today offering free vaccines noone there. Sad freaking story masks thing guy came work mask irked hard teased lo behold month later wearing masks lmao me, ""almost everyone "" includes unvaccinated people, know fellow north americans, someone said vaccinated people maskless okay, unvaccinated people would go maskless shriek violation body, HIPAA, etc.... would rather die take vaccine, thinks vaccine kill him? fascinating observe smooth-brain logic! agree. concern right kids young shot. restrictions measures pre-vaccine obviously things change basically makes unlikely catch it, chance did, you‚Äôre unlikely experience serious symptoms. sound bad anti-mask/anti-vaxxers. Must wierd feeling self absorbed. Asia masks time considerate people around keep getting sick. really gross rugged individualism seeped every facet society. Hopefully learn empathy college, going need it. didn‚Äôt stop wearing mask vaccinated? continued wearing mask despite vaccinated - despite CDC recommendations. Unless legit reason get vaccinated health reasons - it‚Äôs highly - highly - unlikely person voluntarily chooses vaccinated would still wear masks. bring New Zealand?  ask why?

I totally get protecting someone know immunocompromised, otherwise seems like overabundance caution. odds vaccinated person getting sick vanishingly low. could go CVS \right now/ 

BTW went Walgreens today honestly told pharmacist J&amp;J would like Pfizer booster. said allowed instructions J&amp;J people get one shot. wun't readin' nuthin' Bible! That's th' thing guvner says we're allowed tuh learn! consider behavior puts unnecessary COVID risk, stuff like ""automobile crash"" often officers fault, least one ""training accident,"" cops clear majority cop killers.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* None. They're busy bullying Fauci host unrelated issues. worry might saying J&amp;J people go around taking additional shots people need them.

This similar US Government told us early need masks they're worried would mask shortage hospitals.

But live America there's currently surplus vaccines take additional jab prevent someone else getting one. want darn answer get pfizer shot top J&amp;J. Absolutely. get people sides fact know shit going. Would hate send kid day care gets covid fucking lung scarring things people get. yet, lot people still dont want it. Dramatic much? Lmfao. 

Did expect everyone put life hold flu season? colleges require vaccines masking, ever done masks? hell kind message 'might want consider'? recommended not? full interview Fauci give context it, headline floppy misleading. Fauci suggesting places surging cases encouraged wear mask indoors. 

Imagine asking person date, say back you, ""I might want consider going date you."" people get shots people complained masks every precaution imposed them. quite literally asking everything that's coming them. I've dozen MLB games 30k people, far gotten sick 

I concerns anymore. available evidence suggests near-universal adoption non-medical masks public, combination complementary public health measures could successfully reduce effective-R 1.0, thereby stopping community spread."" Never gonna happen , everyone live got rid soon decided needed (for vaccinated folks).

You literally might see one person supermarket wearing one now. People done vaccinated going refuse go back. unvaccinated REALLY need consider vaccination. ? tell ‚Ä¶ 100%. people vaccinated lower chances getting it, hence term Herd Immunity. One vaccinated person exposed room full unvaccinated people coming going among others vaccinated means home free. people room vaccinated, less likely one person catch person vaccinated lower risk. get point truly home free, 70% come contact need vaccinated, overall spread unlikely since virus weaker vaccinated people, less threat get it. Vaccines lower chances becoming infected, getting sick infected, needing hospitalized, dying well ask risk transmitting virus. They're quite good nothing perfect. Wearing mask vaccinated adding extra bit protection.  Well good know give AF anyone yourself. I'll go let immunocompromised friends family know Pandemic can't get sick anymore bc random redditor says so. US switching Australia approach would impossible point. 

It would require several months lockdowns, probably point person per household go essential reasons like grocery runs, it‚Äôd enforced police. 

They‚Äôd mask mandate whole country, hefty fines punishment ensure compliance. 

Also, they‚Äôd need find way get everyone board contact tracing probably least weekly asymptomatic testing everybody.

When half states won‚Äôt even public health measures begin with, even people pro-lockdown states starting become wary, would never work. Almost everywhere US least, unvaccinated choice. I'm respecting choice expose illness I'm almost completely protected against. Yo listen guy, thinks masks helpful :/

To understanding strain covid rarer kids get adults still get hospitalized. sure Delta less dangerous. might enough info/stats new variant really know dangers yet. Play safe everything protect family - masks, sanitizer, disatncing, etc etc. Certain states absolute shitshow failures. Totally embarrassing grown ""adults"" first world country enough money fund programs want acting like this. Pathetic. usually one people wearing one I‚Äôm fully vaxxed. Everyone stares whatever hope things work well! Thank you! Yup. get walking pretty much pharmacy, walk-in clinics everywhere. deliberately waited could walk house get one without appointment, 2 months ago.  Remember efficacy studies affected current levels interventions communities study, well viral ecosystem study period. Would could. Can‚Äôt quite afford yet.

But best believe wear mask lot.  Depends area. Certain counties USA also meet numbers, esp 12+ children added in. live one area, go school requiring vaccinations. think would pointless require masks. I'm Florida. I'm disappointed CDC. thought change leadership would lead different path, boy wrong. want something funny find Pence vs Harris debate clip says appalling commit faith taking potential vaccine, would follow scientific guidance.

I suspect may better information promising really seeming.

But still argument faith vs science.

Only faith declines scientific evidence recommends. Israel's study vs infection, UK study symptomatic infections.

A recent study Singapore produced similar results inline Israel UK - 69% effectiveness infection 80-90% protection vs symptomatic infections.
  
 
*A Singapore study found COVID-19 vaccination (Pfizer/Moderna) provides 69 per cent protection infection Delta variant coronavirus, regardless symptoms, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said Wednesday (Jul 7).* 
 
*Citing study National Centre Infectious Diseases (NCID) Ministry Health (MOH), said data also showed vaccine's protection symptomatic disease ‚Äúbetween 80 90 per cent‚Äù.* 
 
*‚ÄúEffectiveness vaccination severe COVID-19 disease, requiring oxygen supplementation, ICU (intensive care unit) care death, 93 per cent,‚Äù added.* see point. assume looking antibodies know covid. never showed symptoms way tell got infected. can't consider break-through case, since impossible tell occurred vaccine. idea.

But googled ‚Äúxxxxxx county vaccination rates xxxxxx zip code‚Äù found it. think I‚Äôve seen comment ( remember someone wanting move mentioning teacher young baby ) . hope things work out, born raised work engineer it‚Äôs hard want leave, understand totally different situation someone Married/ kids. anybody link study? honestly know. suppose could reason I'm rando immunology classes far past remember anything useful.

I think I've read 90-99% efficiency vaccine, meaning 1-10% vaccinated people develop symptoms, people, symptoms contagiousness low time. Jim Crow understander logged talked one ED physicians Tupelo he's already seeing regional hospitals filling MS really hope so. feels like they‚Äôre trying gaslight people thinking they‚Äôre whiny little babies wanting see people‚Äôs faces vaccinated (the original end goal!)

I wore mask every public situation CDC guidance came vaxxed people. enforced work‚Äôs mask policy stringently. think masks SUCK. They‚Äôre natural item keep around indefinitely. explain us way similar Jim Crow? Go ahead, we're waiting!   enters body fights off, could test positive Covid? It‚Äôs breakthrough cases?  It‚Äôs worth expanding actual ‚ÄúIf want go extra mile safety even though you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre indoors, particularly crowded places, might want consider wearing mask,‚Äù Fauci said interview Wednesday ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs suggested wear mask indoors situation level dynamics virus community that‚Äôs high,‚Äù Fauci said.

He *isn‚Äôt* calling broad mask mandate‚Äîreading lines, you‚Äôre Walmart Missouri, think may reasonable still wear mask.

*(And listen, hate wearing masks, they‚Äôre alienating fog glasses, it‚Äôs reasonable signal people nervous it‚Äôs OK wear them.)* Plenty places measures place flu went too. CDC‚Äôs fault. Florida, haven‚Äôt ability enforce local mask mandates several months. 95% people big cities wore inside businesses anyway. 

Cue CDC‚Äôs ‚Äútake masks off‚Äù hogwash. Almost masks came one time. 

Now what? You‚Äôll never put genie back bottle. 

I hope they‚Äôre pleased themselves.  paper anything JnJ vaccine. paper all... recover. not, moot. Ya, become pretty evident fully vaxxed people catch covid still. far less likely would end severe symptoms though. think CDC expected quite many vaccine holdouts is. recommended dropping mask mandates IMO. 

Here Ontario Canada, beginning open things like indoor dining. higher percentage fully vaxxed people US, even higher population least one dose. still even talked removing masks yet daily lives. think gonna tough get American populace begin everyone thought done it. Fun fact, also concerts, sporting events spectators, movies, indoor dining, church services. say flu went away piece cloth ridiculous.   said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve continued wear mask‚Äù - obviously despite vaccinated.

There slew people attacking calling fully vaxxed people selfish horrible listening CDC ditching masks said OK so, previously also following masking distancing recommendations.

I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs implying fully vaxxed sudden stopped listening CDC.

You can‚Äôt say ‚Äúfollow science CDC - news bad!‚Äù told husband today wanted move. I'm originally here. I've since 96'. I've always hated it, stayed family. mom sister want move. baby right pandemic feel like can't even enjoy stupid here. mom gets harassed work covid anti maskers anti vaxxers (healthcare worker). done. family want stay. can't anymore. start back teaching university 2 weeks person masks vaccines required.

Although knew this, know why...and think that's understand immunity meant myself. 

I think reason people think hear phrase ""make one immune to"", sounds like body impervious virus entering body. 

Can think way way help regular people better understand (and reconcile) fact immunity mean ""impossible infected"" fact accurate say vaccines makes one immune virus? Let‚Äôs go crazy, perhaps vaccines work? Agreed. let regular citizens punish covid deniers. I'm thinking tasers. Counterpoint: masks normal. Within month mandates dropped, almost every store dropped mandates ~90% customers dropped masks. Likewise, virtually everyone dropped masks outdoors said unnecessary.

Nobody likes wants things. people vaccinated, isn‚Äôt going end. doesn‚Äôt even matter government mandates. People going stop eating restaurants. People going mask (this already starting). move farther normal.

Vaccine passports coax many get vaccinated end back old normal.  Children Get COVID Vaccines? Science Says

Short answer: **Yes.**

From Data show children particularly adolescents play significant part coronavirus transmission, says Catherine Bennett, epidemiologist Deakin University Melbourne, Australia. concerns transmission children adolescents growing new coronavirus variants emerge. It‚Äôs possible more-transmissible variants develop way push whatever young person‚Äôs immune response makes resistant infection, says Bennett, making important vaccinated. Dark, effective. know. feel like family member selective hang with, told friends hang indoors together got shot. Especially since kid 12, also tested positive. Insane right. Lotta mask wearers trust science showing vaccines effective. Well, 98.x% vaccine effectiveness death \~50% vaccination rate means 20000 people would die Covid without vaccine, \~10000 vaccinated \~10000 aren't, vaccinated, would still expect 100-200 die anyways.

The low number 43 nearly 9k actually suggests vaccines effective death. know :( hang there. wedding amazing matter what.

Whether like not, whole pandemic political issue since start. health part easy stuff Florida give free ``I'm fully vaccinated !`` kozzi cups every second dose. people seen get fully vaccinated get Covid weeks/months afterwards still mild symptoms.

Edit: mean say feeling less sick short time compared non-vaccinated individuals. would say certain parts LA wear masks, live San Gabriel area far restaurants stores masks ask clients masked.

People like zero clue demanding, often times ungratifying, working healthcare profession is. It‚Äôs possible, odds getting you‚Äôre vaccinated low. tested positive PCR test almost certainly covid time. considering getting vaccine today (Pfizer) putting while, wanted ask questions:

* kind scared needles. point fainting, point hesitant queasy getting shots. tips this?
* perks vaccinated? Obviously protection serious COVID, reducing chances getting others sick, etc., since risk conditions young think first part applies (but protecting others important though). area, masks required indoors regardless vaccination status, reward incentive programs anymore state, store giving away $10 coupons dose that's something. perks vaccinated missing?

My bf got J&amp;J going go get Moderna booster doctor‚Äôs advice starts nursing school fall. Many ‚Äúfully vaxed‚Äù people received J&amp;J- it‚Äôs performing well delta. Even Pfizer performing significantly worse Moderna (maybe due lower dose lipid nanoparticles?) comes severe delta hospitalizations/death. Agree settled (as know, science ongoing process) none posted contradicts current recommendation wiping groceries likely needed prevent transmission. 

- everything posted (of double check go it), 2 meta analyses would hold highest weight hierarchy evidence.

This already legal need Senate approve it. Companies decide want it.

There significant segment population would favor shopping stores mandate full vaccination all* employees. Similarly, significant segment population would prefer work businesses mandate full vaccination all* employees. Market forces help push world toward vaccination, market forces alone enough.

*: ""full vaccination all"" allows legitimately medically unable receive vaccine remain unvaccinated, IMO exceptions Agreed. People acting like CDC completely unjustified overly simplifying equation act dramatic. think pros cons making mask rollbacks did, think decision justifiable choice. Telling people need continue wear masks vaccinated would horrible idea. course never see alternative, I'd bet vaccine rates would even lower now. would people avoid vaccine CDC's messaging would make seem ineffective, would likely started revolt masks anyways. mask requirement might well return last year would rather stay home go try enjoy place mask on.

And plenty people still getting sick dying. Wearing mask harm. number sociopaths thread amazing.  Immunity ability resist infection. Vaccine effectiveness measured comparing different ""endpoints"" comparable vaccinated unvaccinated groups. endpoints could range infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalization, way death. clinical trials COVID vaccines top line effectiveness that's reported typically symptomatic disease, meaning people vaccine deemed effective may gotten infected without knowing it, find effectiveness endpoints. Studies found vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines, also effective blocking infection entirely. Contracting virus synonymous infected. 

In common usage people think immunity impossible infected, individual ever absolutely certain infected given disease exposure. Even vaccines provide effective lifelong immune resistance 100% effective. would accurate say COVID vaccines make one immune SARS-Cov-2 virus. IANAD imagine immune response generated memory cells would neutralize infection chance wreak much havoc. that's true second shot? Yeah vaccination place let use phone selfies due privacy concerns. course, get half law makers (or 60% things) actually agree that.

Ya bunch wierdos!! number fully non-vaxxed people didn‚Äôt make explain efficacy rates. maybe stop scaremongering bad headlines. school starts less two weeks mask requirements, social distancing, etc. CDC made kids sitting ducks Delta. point, get creative. First, important realize safe mean foregoing seeing loved ones. always visit outside needed; that's husband throughout lockdowns. We'd people sit around fire outside, socially distanced, fine. Yeah, sucked hug people, like never saw anybody again. 

I know solution is. thought solution would vaccination stupid enough think everyone could get vaccinated would. (How dumb I, right?) I've hospitalized severe pneumonia lung issues, lot easier extremely strict stuff spent time lying hospital bed gasping air, scared life - even COVID. Remembering makes easier pill swallow. debunk something never asserted first place? efficacy studies showed ~95% reduction disease. Last checked 95 100. vaccines accomplish dramatic reductions chances dying, getting severe disease, showing symptoms, getting infected, order reduction. Obviously people show symptoms still transmit, vaccines make much less likely. don‚Äôt see hard understand. Nothing changed regard. reasonable wear mask indoors suspect people unvaccinated. asking how, 10x number thing, Florida reached herd immunity. perhaps know. optimistic bs. lot denser, boston higher population whole state vermont. yeah good point Definitely.

The unvaccinated people *world wide*, larger breeding ground variants (mutations) allow, likely could arrive mutation existing vaccines effective against. also speeds mutation process mutations occur propagate. purely probabilistic provides good framing look things.

Moral story large unvaccinated population danger (and small percentage vaccinated population), they're danger everyone stop pandemic reduce opportunities virus get another shot us. short term they're largely danger themselves. long term, danger everyone. allright, good hear! Idk is, last month daughter caught covid, dad got didn't. Pfizer Moderna. many factors could affected this, interesting. still like bad cold mild fever. felt crappy like 4 days fine. also overweight, worried. thanks stupid CDC. concrete number work find low-balling good solution. illustrate point low chance still mattering greater mass. could've guessed number probably would've high, help somebody who's already scared. also clarified real number low.

i also understand propaganda fits there? may need elaborate. anti-vax crowd ALSO crowd resists masking, social distancing, mitigation measures. know they're envisioning getting pandemic containing damage; want people die, guess. Wait sec, math get 93% ? 

I would think (4,800,000-49)/4,800,000 = 99.999917% effectiveness. math correctly?  want fucking buy beer cheap again! bullshit let in! Lmao Fauci walked back statements. totally support hope gets wants. know mean. Good you. Solid plan. Best luck! Rooting you! Stay safe! Best luck him. Wow. Shame know people worried kids really need take time approval children.

It‚Äôs process adults. agree sentiment, tone implies need take extra time. don‚Äôt. data trials, it‚Äôs shown safe, move forward low risk severe Covid. 

I grow tired position. 

So? myriad complications (long covid, organ damage, lung scarring, etc.) factored outside severe covid/death. That‚Äôs minimal thing consider it‚Äôs legitimate position/argument have. 

‚ÄúOh, stop whining, children resilient.‚Äù Isn‚Äôt good enough argument virus, revise position consider accordingly. take lot analysis absolutely certain vaccines safer children getting Covid.

Again, process adults found safe effective, already know answer; remarkably safer covid. Hopefully, get another briefing Pandemic Task Force today. last one, said getting transfers greatest portion area. sounds like longer cares biggest critics die. Vaccinated people still get it, still pass on, severity lower get it, viral load lower pass on. unvaccinated people around, higher probability getting is, even vaccinated, emphasis reaching herd immunity. people still believe. I've heard coworkers say vaccine something government wants get, they're control media course want scare getting vaccine need. Shit baffling me. Thanks  good headline‚Ä¶. mean good people died headline doesn‚Äôt try click bait create fear Yup, grandma's skilled nursing wing(which seeing fatality rate around 50% cluster grandmother apart - know called every week automated updates death counts) amazingly. small subset people vaccine really protect - usually people anti-rejection meds organ transplants stuff. sort people herd immunity supposed protect.   free care covidiots refuse vaccine. pay themselves. months big burden, start talking years though starting become kind big burden. want wear mask forever. Doesn‚Äôt make sense half people aren‚Äôt vaccinated? 

They opportunity, vaccinated people free live lives.   Epidemiologist Dr. Katelyn Jetelina posted great article blog yesterday called ""Vaccine hesitant: help?"" can't link blog host gets caught sub's spam filter, find via searching ""Your Local Epidemiologist"" feel free vet credentials. 

This sub likes paint vaccine hesitant broad brush according studies linked complicated that. And, interestingly, types language messaging works totally opposite across different demographics. do's don'ts, well snippets interviews previously hesitant people vaccinated changed minds.  work one. guy caught brother. brother died, guy missed work months, still get vaccine. live missouri think i'll go outside without one ever :/ clear real world data J&amp;J Vaccine provides substantial protection COVID-19, [and works delta recent study cable news outlets going crazy about, small study--not peer reviewed--done **in vitro** (that's study test tubes lab, real humans.. ) contradicts real world data currently available. also directly contradicts results clinical trials vaccine.

There real world data indicates J&amp;J higher rate breakthroughs vaccines. is, share data I'll admit wrong.

**DEFER CDC GUIDANCE, GUIDANCE CABLE NEWS OUTLETS**

Until trusted public health agencies **US CDC** **NIAID** state otherwise, current existing guidance continues apply. panic new study news sensationalizing. continue pay attention coming days additional announcements. always, manage risk profile, defer guidance public health officials, primary care doctor. are. not. like flu vaccines. Except historical efficacy infection flu vaccines 50%. current COVID vaccines, it‚Äôs still greater far. 

The issue, course, without social distancing masking, unvaccinated giant Petri dish virus continue evolve, making better able infect.  Agreed 100%. proves lies taken root deep almost like we're looking people living different world reality. going lie, whenever see people like wild, always wonder what's like detached reality, world around them. What's like care people?   assumes presence vaccine immunity would allow virus ‚Äúlearn.‚Äù

No, learning selective pressure.

In environment people vaccinated, traits make virus resistant vaccines confer significant evolutionary advantage thus less likely become dominant environment vaccines prevalent (but still prevalent enough confer herd immunity). PA consider people vaccinated they're two weeks past second dose. 

My guess lot folks organ transplant recipients another illness take medication completely wiped immune system. Fucking awful, feel families. You‚Äôre wrong, vaccinated people going back mask wearing never really stopped. BS. Rich people saying idiots poor people get vaccinated apparently trick family ( 2 sisters) came back holiday (not me) covid symptoms. sent covid test government test returned back positive, self test kit came back negative. I‚Äôm sure COVID not.

I heard might COVID done self test kit, test came back negative. since morning I‚Äôve started coughing ( tiny bit ) clearing throat lot more. mean COVID, even though self test came back
Negative?   Hell buddies girlfriend town wanted leave medical advice didn‚Äôt like treatment plan place wanted hydroxychloroquine. blew mind, literally excellent insurance zero pocket cost, ass willing risk insurance cover treatment wanted team trump pushing.  wish people would realize this. People act like putting dirty rag face going wipe covid. antibody test delta specifically?  mean, personally care side effect know two women happily got vaccine, periods came week two early guess what? fucking care complain it. was. 

I swollen lymph node (it's still swollen, record) biopsied, went WHOLE FUCKING ORDEAL thinking, especially location, cancer. not. Histology showed B cell process indicating basically immune system working overdrive (malignancy). 

Shit happens. like April May plenty articles, etc. happen. 

Would vaccine? Yes. Yes would. 

Some people want cancer scare. hell. People going downvote go on. period thing like, whatever. Sometimes physiological changes body affect organ systems regulate hormones. really happen. Biochemically (that's quite vague word, record) shit work way. 

Not mercury fucking retrograde, no. 

That stated, lymph nodes swell body fighting viral bacterial infection. lymphatic system works way. flu HPV vaccines thing. 

I idea anyone would care early period. Late? Yeah pregnancy scare sucks lot lol. there's one test that. Cancer scare, know many people go see? much hospitalization cost? Thanks! I'm basically back normal now. Indeed was, albeit lack social media may slowed spread somewhat. Here's nice summary: don‚Äôt even mention number dead unvaccinated? 

Thanks posting think bs clickbait headline, often headline betrays less sensational article.    don‚Äôt prevent infections

Vaccines almost always work preventing infections. Measles around much despite contagious Covid. That's Smallpox gone Polio almost gone. 

They meant make body generate antibodies virus come contact it. vaccine effective enough across broad populations high degree efficacy people's bodies stop infection completely. solved problems. Vaccine mandates, passports, border quarantines. Life lot close ‚Äúback normal‚Äù countries measures countries without them. problem kids vaccinated, degree social responsibility hard wear mask.  Yes people were, many died. n95

the government want promote would mean spend money establishing huge reserve healthcare workers one general public gets encourage wear them. they'd rather people get sick die even kn95

the government want promote foreign standards US soil like KN95 even korean KF94. ultimately tried nothing already run ideas. would work? Trial data won‚Äôt complete September-November. 

It would criminally irresponsible authorize understanding it‚Äôs safe respective age bracket. 

I‚Äôm frustrated desperately want kid vaccinated, there‚Äôs process. We'll able identify 3 strongest variants give medals. makes sense, lot healthcare reactive, like juice makes can't break arm sprain ankle. They‚Äôre already this. See ‚ÄúArise Freedom‚Äù tour going nationally. bit misleading, given vaccine wasn‚Äôt widely available March? April? Still, get vaccines, ya dopes. Making virus deadly incentive vaccination kinds people minds inevitable defeat proves personal superiority. Well said! I‚Äôm reasons too. course ‚Äúwhat I‚Äôm 5% breakthrough, worse, bring spouse heart condition they‚Äôre breakthrough?‚Äù Also, I‚Äôve discovered really fucking love getting little disease floating around there. Masking great imho! Seriously. knows comes mixing pot True millions vaccinations. 

I would expect many documented cases long Covid vaccination occurring. studies healthcare workers regular PCR-tested regardless symptoms compared similar unvaccinated group, see 90% reduction total Covid cases vaccinated group. 

Many people equated 90% total invulnerability ever even contracting Covid. me, 90% excellent it‚Äôs still 9 10. Unlikely insanely rare. 

Long Covid fully vaxxed people reports, really suspect it‚Äôs 1/1000 1/10000. Especially consider fortunate age health status‚Ä¶ risk worth continuing isolation misery 2020. 

I‚Äôm opening change priors behavior new data. government, schools, employers legally mandate vaccination. It‚Äôs complicated.  anyone know 1918 pandemic also rampant misinformation? combatted? 

I know there's social media back people spreading rumours still right? 70% effective against? Infection, symptomatic illness, hospitalization/severe disease/death? former two cases, results still good. latter would little concerning. personally believe kids Vaccinated. necessarily everywhere, places might around indoors. take kids many places indoors around anyone know Vaccinated. works ways opinion. Parents need responsible kids. Restaurants really great place bring unvaccinated kids right now, necessary socially, taking alleviates mask burden others. 

I'm worried maskless kids may exposed unvaccinated parents packed crowded Schools less social distancing, adults public places less necessary kids, anyone's at. **[citation needed]** Lol why? ridiculous. Canada needs way protection Americans them. passed us vaccination rates last week keep climbing. Awesome! forget still cautious shot No. 2. deaths unvaccinated. Ban smoking then. Ban fast food. bigger killers Covid? 

Yes ‚Äòchoice‚Äô, also going outside socialising potentially catching flu Covid choice. 

We‚Äôve never ever force people vaccines before, order vaccine 99.999% effective preventing deaths given vaccinated death rate 1 100,000, would case that, vaccinated, everyone would dead now.

Think way - imagine disease kills unvaccinated one person thousand exposed it. thousand people get vaccinated, exposed disease. One person dies. vaccine 99.9% effective preventing disease? - number deaths would gotten without vaccine, 0% effective!

Now, obviously, numbers covid vaccines much, much better that. *are* very, effective preventing death. 99.999% effective. That's obviously nonsense. hospital flu considered ‚Äúdroplet precautions‚Äù spreads, gown, gloves surgical masks required. 

COVID ‚Äúairborne precautions‚Äù, means airborne isolation room (if available, lol), gown, gloves N95. 

Just FYI thought might enjoy. No, death bed, regretting actions late Guess we‚Äôll probably find out. Really, really wish would tied stimulus funds recent monthly childcare payments vaccination status. vaccinated, don‚Äôt get owe back. Big miss.

However, rational provide bit extra security unvaccinated toddler. 1% one study, cant compare cause 10% got recovered vs 60% vaccinated vs 40% unvaccinated, obviously since recovered less less delta infection numbers.

We cant reach conclusions It‚Äôs bit disingenuous attribute solely mask wearing. want normal school year FFS Sounds like parroting stuff heard really understand.

I'd also encourage anyone get vaccinated ASAP. Vents pretty much last resort days; discovered late spring 2020 net bad thing cases. lupus, never lupus. rate fatal crashes 16-19 year olds 2017 4.8 fatal crashes per 1m miles driven. round 5 make math easy, means fatal accident every 200k miles driven 16-19 year old.

That‚Äôs really lovely. think it‚Äôs especially important remember mental health needs people *terrified* right thing anyway. want point ""lower efficacy"" mean vaccine working less frequently. vaccine ""working"" effectively 100% time ‚Äì means slightly larger proportion people still get positive test PCR (in way, arbitrary way measuring someone infected not).

Covid notwithstanding, getting sick past year+ amazing, bronchitis subsequent sinus infection shit care repeat time soon. disagreeing interpretation data? 

If believe data, think pretty immediately believable say, retroactively, vaccinated people ~7% likely die unvaccinated people. 

Of course reasons that-- maybe people likely die also likely get vaccinated. Maybe vaccinated people party went around kicking door knobs. 

To degree though, possible control factors. data record, like article, truth effective vaccine is. Controlling age simple enough, groups like PHE this, probably never able parse people's risk appetite influences likelihood get vaccinated, people's vaccination status influences risk appetite. 

I think fine say data set, vaccine appeared 93% effective preventing death, long also looking data sets appears 99% effective. variance part actual world play out. Yes, vaccines developed, trialed, authorized basis ability prevent symptomatic disease, infections.

Nah need thanks. people get vaccinated. stats exist country level.  earth get idea masks ineffective? need start somewhere. get 6 weeks anybody starting today fully vaccinated choice there?  yes every auto immune condition identical. There's many issues brain... Follow money market Moderna bigly vs Pfizer. Could Moderna stronger easier store assumption. haven‚Äôt, Hawaii averaging 100, that‚Äôs much, it‚Äôs largely unvaccinated, 70% Hawaiians Frist shot 55% fully. yeah that‚Äôs fear monger report.  like third American adults? Stock market shaky. all. never, never care voters. cult members cannon fodder relentless pursuit personal wealth. rationale. similar symptoms viruses genetically similar.

For vaccine, however, mutations make big difference.

It's like changing key slightly. changes matter lock still opens. changes matter lock open need different key. Vaccinated people likely spread delta covid (and flavors too), much less effectively

In terms ""much less"" portion quote, that's actually *theory* proven. able provide studies journals backing specific claim reduced transmission rates vaccinated none currently exist.

According CDC: ""A growing body evidence indicates people fully vaccinated mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna) less likely asymptomatic infection transmit SARS-CoV-2 others.""

And that's terms hard facts available moment. I've read estimates 40-60% reduction transmission rates would great, surely enough act like vaccinated transmitting COVID others. one person get sick (me).

So vaccinated one group? Stopped reading timesofisrael.com tbh  think Darwin would call something different. thought would go away saw opportunity dial culture war animus. going away they're tactical retreat trying rewrite history pro-vax/taking-covid-seriously side whole time. infuriating.  Indeed, plenty families freedom selfishly declare ""over them"" realize there's still need shield voulnerable ineligible family members breakthrough cases effectively vaccinated close relatives. may help: flu vaccines redesigned yearly, variants believed ones likely spreading next flu season. are, historically, 50% effective infection, highly effective severe disease. 

I would venture say every adult has, one point another, flu. I‚Äôd twice, 24 years apart. times wasn‚Äôt sick enough hospitalized, sick enough miserable, develop bronchitis side effect. 

Without vaccine, two years ago(another 24years), caught grandson, brought Italy. significantly less ill was. fever lasted week. Mine lasted 4 days, started feeling better. 

No bronchitis. 

If COVID variants behave like flu, it‚Äôs likely will, remain serious disease whenever it‚Äôs contracted most, deadly some. 

A vaccinated populace would slow evolution variants crawl. would significantly fewer deaths long COVID cases.  fact White House/CDC debates masking tells politicized whole situation now. many nations, states, cities, schools view covid-19 public health problem public relations problem. Covid policy often tool keep current party office.  Sure, masks 1 point, everything else 4821 points.  details Arkansas Department Health released deaths occurred children 18 years old.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. ‚Äî According Arkansas Department Health, two total pediatric COVID-19 deaths Arkansas.
The first reported ADH end last year, took time officials confirm.
""The details release deaths occurred children 18 years old,‚Äù ADH spokesperson said.

Arkansas's cases surged recent weeks delta variant virus low number people getting vaccinated.
On Wednesday, July 22, department health reported 13 new deaths, putting Arkansas's total death count 6,020. 

Arkansas's vaccination rate remains one lowest country, little 35% state reported fully vaccinated. Per CDC, kids really risk COVID regards long COVID [there's little evidence persistent symptoms part part Fox News getting sued violating Consumer Protection Act advocating vaccines. politicians skating thin ice artificially made Fox News (other, newer outlets popular yet). would love know what's causing shift, I'm sure suit factor. inconvenient morons refusing get vaccinated - vaccinated longer wear mask.

Sorry hard understand. ^

When worried optics hypothetical future scenario actual emergency hand.

This guess theory. KNOW incentives work. So, what's priority? Punishing people antivaxx, helping many people possible get vaccinated? Feels reals? go again! go again. FFS. breakthrough infections noteable covid vac. Also, lot people think cold flu. There's lot overlapping symptoms. know flu much worse cold obviously, bad infection might think cold. mutations spike protein itself, vaccine slightly less effective (it provides protection vast majority spike protein, minus part mutated, compared spike protein original strain). Way masks? real everything asked do, set bubble 5 people, canceled Thanksgiving family cases got control ordered groceries pick up. even bandana cover face hikes. Let live little! Wow, that‚Äôs far people infected vaccination US. Aren‚Äôt using vaxx US? afraid, it. wanna, go ahead. I'm vaccinated, I'm young perfect health, anyone tells mask piss off. hated damn things almost entire pandemic (I'll admit came handy cold winter nights walking back apartment) Vax card liscense never wear one afaic haven‚Äôt sick year half, exception COVID

I'd say...that's pretty big exception. Exactly. I'm L.A. County reinstituted mask mandate. One still-at-home kids works register bakery/cafe. grandmother, mother, vaccinated 86 COPD hospitalized pneumonia couple years ago started simple cold. kid still diligently masking work never stopped. can't risk breakthrough, cases L.A. really surging.

Around 19% L.A.'s cases last week breakthroughs locales reporting similar rates (Marin County, Lexington, KY Boston). I'm sure messaging around need get fast propagandists start running away it. 1: Moderna. 1st shot nothing. 2nd shot got chills day. planned taking working shots. Didn‚Äôt need take first shot. second shot. 

2: took 15 minutes checking getting shot. gave nurse $25 gift card. 

3: faint eye doctor. Lol. know feel. Either close eyes possible ask doctor could get anti anxiety prescription getting shot. told doctor prescription go eye doctor dentist. didn‚Äôt faint last time eye doctor!

4: Although I‚Äôm still cautious wear mask grocery store, longer worried virus wreaking havoc organs get infected. advisors looking whole state data. looking county data historical election data. look those, clear panhandle republican strongholds lagging way behind vaccinations regardless age group. record, I‚Äôm completely pro-vax got vaccinated back February. agree getting shots arms important, feels like horse left barn point. Given long takes full efficacy vaccines, variant burned huge swaths country would even effective someone rushed got one today. going huge public health catastrophe, lies squarely feet people actively spreading disinformation. Sure. woke started getting ready work dry cough, stuffy nose, generally felt ""sick."" also fatigue felt cold. working thermometer time, I'm guessing probably fever. drug work got shift. couple days later work sense smell totally disappeared. taken COVID test day received results yet. lunch break, went pharmacy bought rapid test. tested positive job sent home. never got really sick, still pretty uncomfortable. usually get sick either. colds flu least 5 years this. Something strange got canker sore two weeks getting sick. looked supposedly immune system well get canker sores. canker sore least decade. couple days taking rapid test got lab results, positive. Currently working hospital co-worker vaxed pfizer get corona. came back 2 weeks. We‚Äôve also told 20+ covid patients have, 45% vaccinated prior getting it.

Do number Moderna? ask I‚Äôm one people got moderna back January majority population got pfizer. 70 88 percent one day! error bar üòÇ need smarter that. got vaccinated protect case caught COVID, still much catch pass people. 

Here's data stating vaccines 85% effective symptomatic COVID [Here's data published stating vaccines 88% effective symptomatic Delta. Also, study showing vaccines around 80% effective reducing transmission. substantially less likely develop symptomatic covid (Asymptomatic COVID patients barely transmit like studies showing well), substantially less likely spread get want world go back normal, rest us. still pandemic lifting restrictions way early started new surge. 

Utter nonsense. highly transmissable variant spread UK **before** lifted restrictions responsible surge. mentioning fact there's transmissable variant effects vaccinated folks significantly less discussing surge oversimplifying incredibly complex issue point worth talking would lose somebody brought immunocompromised kids? mean this? saying care groups people? catch die, that's fine you? long got act like world normal? trying say here?

Yes, I'm sure they're saying care kids die üôÑ. Come dude. Kids, per CDC every reputable scientific organization, really risk COVID, yes [even regards long covid, really need little research? Vaccinated folks responsible recent surge responsibility fix it. fully vaccinated unlikely get COVID, unlikely spread it, evidenced studies linked above.  That‚Äôs headline important. headline, presumed article would anti vax incorrect. Next time, everyone wait payday vaccination. disagree. people even understand ""germs make sick"" anymore.  read info multiple state‚Äôs hospital systems State Health Departments stating ICU admissions children children ventilators higher ever point pandemic. read local FL paper saw similar information Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama. don‚Äôt know higher viral load higher transmissibility delta both. cannot find study US rapidly emerging data one article indicated hospitalized children vaccine eligible age - 12 year olds infants.  sound concerning sure someone compile articles Health Department announcements somewhere. doesn‚Äôt sound like dramatic increase yet - highest probably worst yet hit schools start variant taking off. debating that, say basically got rid flu solely masks mass stay home orders, cancelled events, restricted travel disingenuous.    him, everyone forced vaccinated, there‚Äôs still risk covid kids‚Ä¶. he‚Äôd probably want I‚Äôm Orlando don‚Äôt see much indicates support. people seemed supportive Demings challenging hands-off approach. really easy spread misinformation people can‚Äôt tangibly see lie.

Once everyone red areas starts knowing people hospitalized, disabled, dead disease, bigger risk start wake fact lied it. likely exponentially more, similar amount time takes debunk lie. Good power through. true, really understand, since fear needles.

Maybe anti-anxiety medication help? Even taking pot (I use pot, sure that). Yep. hill dung built die now. vaccinated countermeasure pandemic.  We've lied to.  virus care vaccinated. 

What think vaccine does? people trying make vaccinated people wear masks selfish ones. selfish say health problem. Masks annoying wear gotten vaccine. Wrong. nobody would get vaccinated without payday.  think CTE rough childhood. Don‚Äôt hit kids folks, grow crazy, aggressive rubes. say china.  person processing virus (I.e. infected) able spread it. masks prevent spread, especially strain that‚Äôs twice transmissible, makes sense.

Correct. However, vaccinated people transmit anywhere 70%-95% less virus non-infected people. that's transmit all. There's studies done (as Washington Post article points out) show COVID-positive vaccinated people actually live virus transmit inside them. Also, remember, obviously vaccinated people much better protected exposed.

So situation there's materially less transmission population even transmission happen, statistically get sick. yet told still wear masks because...reasons? whim? possibility? mean there's possibility 8.0 earthquake hits LA today, one's living said. It‚Äôs annoying. Nobody likes it‚Äôs change feels like step back feels like never end. feel way.

Glad agree consider Israel vaccinated way herd immunity delta changed big way.

Ehhh really. They're still barely getting hospitalizations deaths among vaccinated population. Also one talks lot Israel insanely dense. Like Manhattan steroids dense. I'm talking families 6-8 people living 2-3 bedroom apartments apartment buildings. concept personal space exist Israel. family multiple times. I'm sure cultural difference also adds increased transmission case numbers. Probably new information gotten releasing public yet. Politicians love act like know anything shit goes down. local pharmacy big chain like CVS? incorrect. Source? kids give fuck kids get it, especially means can't go get drink friends bar. context virus community infects, I‚Äôd argue 70% isn‚Äôt good enough Antivaxxers need spread nonsense That‚Äôs it, Delta reproduces rapidly, without antibodies present time takes body recognize respond antigen, breakthrough symptoms. üòÇüòÇüòÇ Great news makes feel better, statistically never even close 1 million breakthrough infections every week, exceedingly rare Well still pandemic going on‚Ä¶ sorry that‚Äôs inconvenient Sorry clear. I'm talking California. (and Reddit whole) greatly underestimate many young (20-30s) republicans country.

What ‚Äúin country‚Äù DeSantis Florida? kids, need lift weights. big driver low vaccine uptake lower income groups? makes sense me, know ICU would cost someone good job tens thousands dollars. bad idea make Medicaid/care pay covid costs unvaccinated. Fox anchors change tune? Tuesday? shit, wanting hear anecdotal cases happening provide optimism instead constant ""I fully vaccinated got infected anyway!"" feel sick it‚Äôs usually day two you‚Äôve spreading. Well yeah could probably open facebook No, I'm done. Yeah tucker loved rail vaccinations folks got them, probably got shots secret selves. push probably go well vaccine push. Since WH can‚Äôt mandate either one, it‚Äôs probably going capture group people. unvaccinated going continue ignore calls. clear, aware COULD still get virus, even vaccinated, vaccine prevent infection all? prevent sickness, prevent infection... least little? yeah, maybe exaggerating showed bill? Get better soon!! Sorry caught crap. sure say show lung xrays ...second time aroundüòÇüòÇüòÇ. thank letting body use host virus mutate happily ever .
Anti vaxxers sadly get educated hits bad. know many get super sick change opinion. long term lung damage. sad. this, /r/CovIdiots Netherlands don‚Äôt care 4th July üòÇ that‚Äôs US numbers Well. lie. Don‚Äôt Fauci Florida!!!! TIL Intubated word Folks dying get hands it. know would great idea? STOP GIVING PEOPLE NEWS COVERAGE!

All give power validation idiots agree him. would look holidays people tend congregate. sports events.  That's actually true though, there's evidence reinfection likely breakthrough infections vaccination, Delta Bro, never get point least somewhat like used be, might well myself. honestly believe. now, we've beaten every major epidemic/pandemic point resume normal life. people 1500s overcome black plague, overcome too. to, humanity's sake. idea Russia US want show world's saviour hilarious. I‚Äôm wondering well. think realistic (pessimistic?) answer nothing. political tolerance another. Even us fine stay home orders last year would balk it, especially we're already vaxxed. close bars there's uptick drunk driving accidents, all. hospital copay twice that, hell no. think point vaccination thing really stop spread. Masks lockdowns delay contagious is. again, problem waiting ""natural"" herd immunity appears natural immunity virus last long translate well variants. caused spike importantly decline? got first dose (and Pfizer) month ago, still got another month go contact second shot. I'm looking forward mostly immune. Yeah! got waiting like 3 4 weeks, get whenever people proffering excuse jump new one FDA approves. think there's really meaningful group people change mind based FDA approval.

What may change businesses choosing mandate vaccination, would welcome step.  hospice nurse years can‚Äôt anything hasten death. may able sue sickened residents sued neglect allowing resident become infected. also call ombudsman notify state board nursing branch covers LTC inspections. law protects home lawsuits might well labeled legal euthanasia law. much pro-life group Sad... Thank you. Honestly wasn‚Äôt bad surprised it. Crazy world there. Father-in-law way. Nearly died covid. Taken house stretcher middle night. week icu 2 weeks rehab ward. Still anti covid vaccine. people need saddled extra, unnecessary costs stupidity anyway. Seems like they‚Äôd agree principle free market, anti-socialism approach. work TV trying get nightly show following lives people covid year. one wants produce it. want follow-drama. want special hospital. even want interview families people died. ""No one wants hear covid"" networks tell us.

I give shit want hear not, NEED hear IMO. sick dying everyone's living room night, opinions would change rapidly. Instead, happens behind closed doors, sight mind.  comment removed applaud putting hermit place. love reality people vaccinated, that's case Alabama chances young healthy person getting intubated MUCH higher.

Vaccinated people done they're supposed people also wear masks well; want fearmonger, stick subreddits southern states. Yeah, surprise, vaccinated folk exactly willing endure punishment poor choices unvaccinated. kids get vaccine sure, recent study I've seen says 9% kids infected long term impairment health. I'm hoping that's symptomatic infections overall smaller percent. Even still that's relatively high chance problems. think people realize probably injuries fatalities. considered important deserve protection infection. sweet irony... ""It wont happen me"" one hell drug states. may take flack believe 90% placebo. It‚Äôs make others feel safe little nothing curb actual spread even far less Delta. mask mandates come gone changes actual weekly case loads.

It‚Äôs go business without interruption. Shutting holding accountable publications spread vaccine misinformation, ie Fox News, OAN, et al. pandemic treated war-time. People‚Äôs lives risk publications knowingly went CDC pandemic scientific basis. think video deepfake designed trick   #LOUDER PEOPLE BACK  man sent reeducation ‚Äúseminar‚Äù Yet another reason I'm glad got vaccinated moment eligible last spring. I'm really really fond lungs grew would hate lose them. Oh, never stopped. Good thing since live Missouri don‚Äôt understand vaccinated people worried then

Me neither.

If vaccinated going get sick. still ""get"" virus somewhat participate spreading it, much less unvaccinated people, cannot get sick care. Everyone opportunity get vaccinated, burden responsibility protect people ignorant get vaccinated. Interesting thanks! Take upvote. don‚Äôt know people feel need downvote simple inquiry. exactly people missing. Mild moderate clinical symptoms lasting months That's south ya. Damn, opened site since Feb. checked county we're back December numbers, bad places considering I'm bay area, definitely good. Delta wave. deep state finally got them! /s little value prevent transmission germs‚Ä¶.

Let restate. Next time need kind surgical procedure, sure tell medical team unmask event. getting downvoted reality. Ochsner NOLA waiting FDA approval goes through. guy video dick btw ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù mean young adults, twelve? I‚Äôm worried fact FDA conservative approving vaccine children twelve, school starting soon vaccine available younger kids mid-winter. I've using sites past year. Wish people would see this. 

But majority people need see understand it, believe it, care.  part lucky 12%. Yep n95s buck piece now. wish Oklahoma cared enough us teachers require masks. governor actually made illegal require them. Someone sub put really well‚Ä¶ vaccine like raincoat, light drizzle don‚Äôt get wet, it‚Äôs pouring do. comes often person wants test vaccine. 

Even mild/moderate cases symptoms last *months* Good Atlanta! risk healthy child dying COVID high enough get people give damn. keep seeing comments stating catching Covid fine we're vaccinated nearly always mild case. article discussing masks fully vaccinated addresses point many others, links existing evidence: illness still isn‚Äôt desirable illness, especially given threat long COVID, reportedly happen vaccinated people, though researchers aren‚Äôt yet sure widely.

Masks slash risks outcomes. Breakthroughs common immune system faces ton inbound virus‚Äîwhen there‚Äôs ongoing outbreak, people around aren‚Äôt immune. mask reduces exposure every time wear one. variants, including Delta, might transmissible, they‚Äôre still thwarted physical barriers cloth."" deaths median age 77 96% least one underlying condition, many 1. hypertension common, followed diabetes. think safe assume generally unhealthy people. vaccines makes sense high risk people. however know long term side effects vaccine. seems silly put young healthy people risk vaccine damages. always risk long covid, risk weigh. mean that's pandemics past ended, it? like Spanish flu kept growing endlessly.

I'm saying lots people, along scientific papers, taken approach without lockdowns virus grow basically every nonvaccinated person gets sick. prominent paper last year modeled 95% Europeans getting virus without restrictions little late Absolutely, get vaccinated. ‚Äúmild‚Äù case absolutely mean sniffles. means didn‚Äôt hospitalized.

So, want, mask up. level risk get mask I'm fully vaccinated ready move life. I‚Äôm intensive care doctor medical director ICU. worked frontlines pandemic since started. new covid cases come ask point blank vaccination reasons aren‚Äôt getting it. far everyone I‚Äôve seen got medical information Facebook television. ask they‚Äôve spoken doctor vaccine, often get defensive. tragic pandemic been, nearly completely preventable. 

After year nonsense, PTSD counseling many staff, I‚Äôm empathy people. I‚Äôll still best treat everyone comes me, I‚Äôve stopped losing sleep lives lost. Well gosh, guess it‚Äôs finally issue realize constituents could die this. problem vaccine mandates vaccines full FDA approval. 

1. That's legal
2. know be. Vaccines still far effective masks already advocating mandatory vaccines instead less effective mandatory masks? Trump actually urging people take ""the Great American vaccines"" nobody paying attention him. First saw months ago. Big failure press: ready amplify manner messages, one. think simply twitter see it. Hope extra-super- duper protection now! 
Edit- waiting 2 weeks second shot. Lol  Way go! went loads therapy combat needle phobia avoided shots age 6-17, luckily never got sick. able walk get covid shot without bursting tears. It‚Äôs hard respect hell anyone afraid needles still gets shots.  They'd turn ""selling liberal agenda"". I'm 19, member high school Class 2020, I'm enter sophomore year college *still* made new friends. Mentally, I'm still senior HS, calendar tells otherwise. 

We've done everything asked us, feel tension rising among people age, understandably so. palpable. way talk, talk about, attitudes. Making people endure one whole year college experience already made many people angry. two years? That's literally HALF one's entire college life. case, people absolutely **LIVID**.  Damn, I'm also 30's friends vaccinated except one, he's health nerd thinks moon fake there's getting past lmao. I've accepted I'm probably going hang time soon, still talk group chat lol. can't imagine multiple anti vax individuals circle, would upset. may gotten away it, winning covid war last month ; things getting better . think realized bad get delta. Now, efforts might little late. Dumb right. like religion. totally indoctrinated like religion military basic training. 

It's allowed see logic outside certain boxes certain edicts, like vaccination edict (handed orange haired demon's cult). important 36% single dose

Get second shot, could save life, least misery. be. else do? I‚Äôm curious, personally covid months ago. still get vaccinated even it? antibodies enough? seeking medical advice Reddit, test positive doctor said quarantine 14 days that. can't speak Trek, share sentiment. seems rather snidely telling people things like ""If get vaccinated, allowed use hospital,"" open discourse seeks understand view overcome misunderstandings would effective raising vaccination rates. Absolutely people hope, point article many whose minds might changed demonizing pushing away. seem underestimating dense stubborn people are. They‚Äôll never learn. Masks primarily work protecting others wearer, wearer others, tend ineffective unless everyone wearing them, hence mandates.

But I‚Äôm guessing already knew that. wake call get ICU even they'll still deny Covid. incredible see misinformation much powerful real information. I've looked data % long covid post vaccination can't find any. loss sense smell etc. Wear masks bit longer. Yes, even you. No, kill ya. sensible situation, gotten vaccinated would get shots ASAP observing pre-vaccine pandemic protocols (masks, social distancing, avoiding groups, etc). willing things before, now. discouraging. That's true. news interviewing Covid patients one hospitals dude straight said get vaccinated 'too risky' ....while oxygen hospital bed. 

Just let stupid ones die off. ‚ÄúTechnically true‚Äù‚Ä¶ even vaccinated people largely affected Delta, doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt take precautions. None us predict would one unlucky ones, exactly worked didn‚Äôt vaccines, even ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù group.    go phase 3 trial approval we're looking booster arms January 2022. That's way late IMO. updated vaccine take flu-shot route, approval comes 30 days FDA production starts. Delta drastically different (genetically) wild Alpha, vaccine need drastically different either. wait line receive COVID-19 jab **Moscow** vaccination centre July everything I've seen far, yes. think it‚Äôs moreso known weakness repressed(i.e projection). example, individual history deceived manipulated likely doubt intentions others especially comes asked required make kind perceived concession. Couple doubt ego‚Äôs default desire view reliable credible suddenly, rather maintaining humility towards judgement, act ‚Äúexperts‚Äù reality. Worst all, weakness easily exploited conmen since trigger insecurity close loop affirming distrust others. It‚Äôs whole Three Stooges gimmick slapping distracted guy pointing dude looks shockingly you. Nail look concern face somehow, won‚Äôt question direction lay dude involvement all. done purposefully. It‚Äôs years dismantling funding schools paying little people can‚Äôt make ends meet. can‚Äôt help kids homework you‚Äôre working much, onus falls easily one lopsided labor/pay problems have: teachers.  GOP voter's feelings moment? Confused? Desantis hannity traitors?  ""After state attorney general revealed earlier year thousands deaths nursing home residents undercounted, Mr. Cuomo finally released complete data, saying withheld concern Trump administration might pursue politically motivated inquiry state‚Äôs handling outbreak nursing good. I'm arguing all. People saying things like ""it prevents death"" ""99.999% effective death"" misinformation. Death possible 5% rate unvaccinated would put us 5% 600,000 - 30,000 people would died. *much* better number, certainly zero. week ago statements vaccines neutral positive. went said weird stuff kids getting vaccinated. live poorly educated region. I‚Äôve heard every excuse government trackers mind control. I‚Äôm guessing hasn‚Äôt seen medical bills yet. completely disagree think governments issuing lockdowns health departments see upcoming surge required prevent hospitals exceeding ICU capacity deaths start pile tough decisions need rest doctor's shoulders lives dies. People eventually make decision, generally well past point causes ton unnecessary deaths. Yep! 70% Israel vaccinated Pfizer Dec/January. UK Started using Pfizer April antibodies ""fresh."" wane, UK see infection starting likely September/October. Sorry hear that, hoping least one doctor (or anyone else) might listen to. hope changes mind soon, sakes. vaccinated? are, don‚Äôt claim ‚Äúbelieve science‚Äù looove data :-) neither. dont know. insurance cover small amount hospitalization still way cheaper US even though single stay cost months salaries here. plan to. Lots skiing. friend spent past weeks Provincetown. housemates (all vaccinated) tested positive tested negative repeatedly. Yeah numbers 60k, agian cuts unvaccinated idiots, vaccinated account small number efficacy like percentage point lower, yeah comment nothing fear mongering‚Ä¶ No, reason slow bureaucratics: Germany follows ECDC rating, determined Thursday, based incidence within last two weeks. change rules accordingly day after. wait Tuesday two weeks ago today wait obvious daily count lead Germany changing rules. Apparently vaccination rates going bit again. maybe are. Israel studying effects real population. They're stage IV trials studying effectiveness real world population. data studies. (i think UK also released real world results,i sure.) Results Studies well real world results coz population choose study manipulated. 

In study, select bunch educated responsible healthy men women studies, population consists wide range people may comorbidities constantly exposed infection due work. They're higher risk actually considered better indicator effectiveness controlled trials. Thank thank sharing this. wish people refuse vaccinate wear mask would waive right medical care catch idiots proclaimed virus fake wanna tell community get shot. I'm American I'm fully familiar insurance plans. fancy plans hospital stays 100% covered? need remove COVID coverage people refuse vaccine. get double dose beliefs. COVID medical bill. support second lockdown, don‚Äôt deserve freedom. Wow start August 5? What's frustrating constantly told progressive youth yet even jab save grandma's life. definitely 88% preventing symptomatic infection. alone know 8 breakthrough symptomatic infections past 6 days. might 88% UK gave pfizer shots late, waning antibodies trouble preventing infection delta. updated shot needed see bunch (mild-moderate) infection fall/winter. Give us option sign waiver. FFS 600,000 dead! [Children 

What could worse we're trying avoid here?   mean, there's massive amount interest finding Ebola comes terrifying would really like know avoid another outbreak.

The reason lab audits West African Ebola outbreak investigation driven scientists thought (correctly) useful thing do. COVID investigation driven geopolitics even talked about. No, 99.991% effective according citation. Nobody ever said 99.99999%

Why making stuff up?

Stop spreading misinformation sub. found law putting misinformation Covid. weren‚Äôt acknowledging apparently lawyers finding FOX knows. Gov. used car salesman Florida realizing everybody Florida dies, won‚Äôt get president. Also prosecuted lying vaccines (if was, assume Republicans have). People begging vaccine get intubated. Hopefully 1 2 comes tell dipshit anti vax friends get vaccine.  rock! Thank sharing! used extremely stressed needles, part still remains, cancer treatments end teenage years really forced calm bit it. took months sweating, high heart rates, lightheadedness stress needles began drop. 100% understand hate needles.

True, good true PPE masks, though close (kN95‚Äôs). said, provide great protection. room, masked, benefit mask yours, preventing airborne virus escaping air, lowering risk breathing get through. 

In every circumstance we‚Äôve seen far groups people, especially unvaccinated (like every kid 12 school), gathering without masks usually leads fairly large scale outbreak among attending. one infected likely pass one person. 

The new delta variant studied shown produce thousand times higher viral load infected people. Simply put, shedding far virus, making far likely you‚Äôll pass on. Additionally, variant changes spike protein makes easier stick cell receptors, allowing enter. 

No, mask isn‚Äôt absolutely perfect, I‚Äôll take protection all. Kinda looks like Frankenstein‚Äôs monster tbh. selectively killing voterbase. ship giant sack espresso beans? Pretty much thing would get people vaccinated point they're inconvenienced decision.

The ""I trust wear mask vaccinated"" rule huge failure know people willing lie, willing underestimate damage virus cause others.

I presume vaccines required attend large-scale public events, we'd see big uptick vaccinations, people US going touch certain factions alt-health movement somehow successfully convinced enough people ""vaccine passports"" bad thing.

Hopefully vaccine achieves full approval, organizations less likely balk requiring proof vaccination. likely going to, think support might help more. helps, I""m think official suggestion 6 weeks post infection.

Others got employers offering incentives (i.e. get whole extra day PTO get shot takes 30 seconds, cash bonuses, etc). state lotteries, CT bars offered free drinks proof, etc.

Some people mentioned got restrictions lifted vaccinated individuals. businesses government requiring proof vaccination things like flying encourage people get it.

I know youth participation much different adults point, considering opportunity get vaccine long teenagers may agency make choice own.

20-somethings, example subset, told year largely invulnerable (former) covid-19 virus. ones see grand folks lot, live immunocompromised people, may likely gotten vaccinated first. rest, well, speak experience, age really interacted with, *aware* interactions with, people age bartenders party hosts. older people sold groceries, even worked with, even grandparents really saw Christmas, basically background noise day day life. Internet really became is. 

They may connect voting, example, civic duty ongoing, consistent peer pressure recent years, connect vaccination level (yet).  outreach youth, like overall response pandemic US, uneven best even within states actually trying. states idea vaccination mask-wearing civic duty fell flat (to charitable), trying fire people *now* months waving off, going really, really challenging.

If connect them, level, parents cohorts, personally can't blame getting know really paying attention things good time either age. They're also school (high school/college) way would normally develop peer pressures peer group identities, exposed messages way Times. Whose lives? present study? Brown University covid information dashboard says public elementary schools never place covid transmission background Medicare/medicaid forced reallocate towards covid. Private choose allocate want, aren‚Äôt legally allowed keep high profits (think car insurance companies paid premiums back members due low utilization). MSNBC fly USA.  many hours would say one needs put new N95? use 3M 9320 model. old ‚Äúim going bankrupt don‚Äôt understand science reason‚Äù 

I can‚Äôt imagine shit must get covid huge bill along side it. took approached cousin nurse. mother batting cancer. post-op floor converted back covid floor speak. cousin. sooner later able visit sick mother again. half ass realization healthcare first responders shouldn‚Äôt front lines (Dare say) civil war. seriously angry piece cloth? It‚Äôs important distinction also demonstrates important vaccinate. Could difference showing minimal symptoms hospitalization death many people. Hows today otherwise? number remember hearing 1/10 get long COVID, high. mother close going hospital, didn't, symptoms year later. I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôll rethink gets bill. shot‚Äôs free. would recommend oximeter. way someone sick monitor oxygen level - dropping need get hospital asap.

They cheap also nice thing around future post covid. uvaccinated people family members can't get vaccine. Yea overall numbers change anyone looking nursing home deaths would find data inaccurate. numbers changed Cuomo's aids show fewer deaths occurred nursing homes changing numbers months. would need change numbers first reported? something people often get wrong, assume republicans refuse get vaccinated look states reporting demographics vaccination data states 65+ white crowd extremely high vaccination rates, like 85%+. case Florida: = 70%

65-74 = 88%

75-84 = 83% 

Considering doctors advising vaccination people heart issues, cancer patients, select diabetes patients rates age groups high they'll ever get even federally mandated vaccination. 

Hispanics blacks 33% 21% vaccination respectively look data would never know it. sure hell friend asked volunteer increase local vaccination rates since I'm fluent Spanish. must knocked least 600 doors today done little trust vaccine largely want part it. legitimate reasons worrying immigration status, realizing 100% free, issues transportation informed things offered ride they're willing that's tiny percentage. 

The issue pretty much black population trust worried unknown long term side effects. governments always shady corrupt, inherent government ever. obvious they've given even power before. lot may care logic, sympathy, empathy, compassion‚Ä¶ again, it‚Äôs pretty obvious outside logic, true pro vaccine people. They‚Äôre getting vaccines altruistic purposes, they‚Äôre protect themselves. societal benefits side effect. attitude toward unvaccinated people proves this.

Also‚Ä¶ history anti-vaccine people isn‚Äôt relevant. Read article, aren‚Äôt necessarily traditional anti-vaxxers. think it‚Äôs important draw distinction ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù regards COVID. absolutely change minds unvaccinated person.

And one saying hospital staff deserve suffer don‚Äôt see that‚Äôs relevant. agree people shouldn‚Äôt pay others‚Äô mistakes fact *that‚Äôs exactly point*.

I think trying argue lumping together. think that's allowed ACA act. that's good thing. Sure, case, wish was, vast majority cases, insurance companies would abuse it. Oh, overweight?, must fault, insurance you. Oh, rollerblading? fault, insurance you. start attributing blame people health issues, start dark, dark road. would cover costs person smokes wear seatbelt get hurt? mention school starts soon. report back person fall prep one half weeks (university level). friends high school teachers report back second week August prep.

I think main factor US though, guys cling word Freedom much. soon sentence starts ""you to"" "" required to"" seems like feel personally attacked. Social stigma good. Refuse invite unvaccinated family/friend group events. trying decide one get, one safest

The Pfizer Moderna basically same. deliver vaccine antibodies using process (mRNA). 

I got Moderna, one available. would've gladly taken Pfizer (or vice-versa). went story looking see age demographics hospitalized people. Left disappointed. believe stupidity punished, severely. know control variables, believe PHE report numbers. source somewhere lists hospitalization status age group vaccination status, could calculation page linked individual age group, would let control age least. think acknowledged publicly. definitely taken Q influence.

I friends I've stopped communicating completely Q stuff. They've lost completely. Full blown conspiracy pedophiles running government, Chinese troops Canadian border.

They ridiculed wearing mask. 
We aren‚Äôt quite bad Michigan (yet) mask wearing population really dropping off. would hope strong advice medical community would enough.

Bud. That‚Äôs whole reason people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated. isn‚Äôt enough. Folks haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet able aren‚Äôt *because* don‚Äôt trust medical professionals, amplified propaganda see online Fox News. Already sense smell back? I'm afraid answer. folks know on-board vaccine fall back percentages. *Oh, 99.8% (or whatever fuck) survive, bad. I'm getting vaccine something deadly.*

The worldometer site puts US death total 650k (ish), still less percentage population. People rationalize rationalize number something like 10%. Even then, knows.

Unbelievable. 


And know kids can't get vaccinated... directly impacting lives, too. knows school year going like. Take trip states get 2nd, they're plentiful right now. NPR report study immunocompromised people getting shots Covid IIRC showed basically zero antibody production vaccines. Pfizer testing reduced doses children. Hopefully work well. ok, ebola, let's try? I'm glad explained logo. idea supposed man jail. think that's fair point.

How someone drives little fast occasion, driven tired? dangerous others. get care made bad decision harm others? I'm seeing fundamental misunderstanding folks. vaccine mean get infected, means (usually) get _sick_ infection. infected, carrier, means increasing spread putting others risk. smaller risk count low coughing people, still vector.

Everyone's anxious pandemic over, keep helping spread along misinformation. time I've ever fever high child, hallucinating way similar article describes: ""When would close eyes, rather vision darkening, saw strange world vivid colors. felt though dreaming, even though awake -- though middle hallucination.""

But instead seeing colors moving/flying scenes slow moving shapes slowly trying crush me. mostly lucid experiencing this, could open eyes ground back reality focusing something near me. really focus, else I'd let relax I'd start getting sucked back hallucination. imagine fun fighting off.

Eh, no. makes opposite anti vaxxers. look numbers science. Anti vaxxers look random things want believe in. world is, can't facts something not.

The point that, kids going school, able sports several magnitudes worse problem overall extremely young kids get ill COVID. Exactly! really pisses people refuse vaccinated expect insurance cover hospitalization costs. expect taxpayers cover it. long insurance companies say sure rates X% higher you‚Äôre vaccinated. 

An MD listen said GBS commonly caused flu. said despite peoples fear flu shot GBS, would go far say flu shot effective way prevent GBS. real need concerned all.

That's working great coastal elites real America. Wondering US CDC cards work since can‚Äôt get digital passes cards.  Delta 100X transmissible vaccines 100%. even vaccinated spread COVID (its less aint nothing).

So masks extra layer protection top vaccines help prevent spread. stock market dropped. Israel giving second shot 3 weeks, per Pfizer's instructions.

The UK giving 8 weeks 12 weeks, Canada giving 8 weeks 16 weeks.

The longer wait bigger antibody response. reason Pfizer trials 3 weeks racing get approval. Waiting 12 weeks would meant trial finished till Feb 2020, whereas finished Nov 2019. Different supplies available different places.   I'm mad. I'm young country can't get vaccinated yet I'm high risk. dad 50 even given second dose. 

These people privileged still get vaccinated, wish dad could.    Best play? Stop worrying others think.

I wear kn95 better mask don‚Äôt want get even mild case infection know vaccines protect long covid. anyone asked, I‚Äôd tell truth: trust vaccines keep hospital, that‚Äôs thing result personally, mask small price pay keep (further, case) disabled.

How someone say this, considering billions people vaccinated there's evidence support statement? referring monoclonal antibodies. Also Remdesivir readily available, think. supplements bought counter anything help covid.

It probably antibodies, Trump, old, fat unhealthy would likely died. everyone paying pocket insurance companies would go bust, make much sense. insurance companies could theoretically deny people risky lifestyles coverage, upping costs somewhat risky lifestyles. People healthy lifestyles would save money, covering much medical costs risk-takers.


That's putting aside ethical issues. live somewhere social healthcare something I've really thought before. Getting virus one thing, getting serious illness, hospitalization death things. now, vaccine appears still help those.

Vaxxeds anything fear close non-vaxxeds (only infectologicaly, mean). it‚Äôs pretty much time get vaccinated haven‚Äôt already seems? seeing correctly variant causing severe deadlier cases unvaccinated?

I think narrative potentially dangerous. There's good evidence mild cases still experience long-term effects major organs (especially heart).

It's great end ER gasping breath, think want people getting Covid even vaccinated. certainly would prefer get it.  free chicken tacos? Well, definitely concerning. :| personally know anyone fully vaccinated. 
Which unlikely (knowingly) spend anytime anyone vaccinated. can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs hard keep up. Thanks MRNA technology, boosters created hours. 

I think bigger issue trying figure need/demand boosters. couple weeks ago boosters weren‚Äôt really high priority Alpha variant. Delta taken (the western world) evading vaccines degree think we‚Äôll see Pfizer moderna bust boosters really fast. 

It helps FDA saying boosters won‚Äôt need go phase 3 trials - quick phase 1/2 trials similar flu shots deal yearly.

I think we‚Äôll get boosters extremely fast - Pfizer moderna start working one, they‚Äôll competing get market first. 

I‚Äôm going bet Pfizer gets first! y‚Äôall think? curious 43 vaccinated died. ages, vaccines comorbidities? Would still suck everything protect still got died. don‚Äôt know vaccination status. 

I‚Äôm Mexico where, around April-May, teachers got opportunity vaccinated one-dose CanSino vaccine (from China). teaching time got it. 

In August-September, vaccination available 18-30 age group and, due trend city, think they‚Äôll use AztraSeneca one. 

I want also take vaccine due CanSino one 65% effective towards infection prevention decline ~50% six months (with wild type covid, knowledge data effectiveness variants) fact Delta starting surge area. 

Another issue might moving US January-February 2022 study neither CanSino AztraSeneca FDA‚Äôs eua status, fear need take another vaccine enter there. 

What think best course action? wait pass one see got another vaccine move? honestly idea. evidence amazing efficacy vaccines, time significant number Texans fully vaccinated, second wave pretty much since community spread virus low. 

So Texas suffers third wave cases large even larger previous wave (see UK think happen), 43 death toll among vaccinated still going grow significantly, likely several times over, least.

I repeat, vaccinations great, provide excellent protection, perfect protection, large wave cases going cause enough breakthrough infections put significantly vaccinated people ICU. 

Of course, numbers continue dwarfed mass unvaccinated people lying alongside them. 12s seem pretty bad spreading 12s appear spread fine. reason vaccinate 12 18 year olds.  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

If calculations correct :

5723 breakthrough cases x 7% = 402 hospitalized cases

402 X 0.8% = 3 deaths

3 cases 5723 0.05%. 

So fatality rate fully vaccinated people appears half flu. Assuming die Covid something else.   like infinity stones.

I mean, Infinity Stones worthless variants. Basically paper weights. TVA said so!  mean, that's 5 months away what‚Äôs point, live lockdown lockdown? did! They're stupid get it. Moderna 72% effective delta variant 1 dose. enough data 2 doses presumably higher 72%.

I‚Äôm tapped moment.  agree. didn‚Äôt wear mask us, decided get vaccinated, go extra mile them?   still too, even area fairly high vaccination rate. 'Cause, I've met people. They're always best holding honor system think consequences do.  guess vent allow wearers droplets sneak out. horrible people? *Has become?* Africa would like word you. right. I'm gonna cross post. Thank god. Right reasoning around recommendations 12 set confusing people. one hand American Academy Pediatrics recommending kids mask-up schools. hand, they've saying since start pandemic, even vaccines, kids schools risk kids COVID less harm caused school. low COVID risk kids 12 one reasons vaccine approval slow age group. Even masks NPIs last year (e.g. masks, cohorts attending two days per week, closing schools middle week cleaning), schools still outbreaks. can't imagine get even worse Delta variant really transmissible claimed. here. I‚Äôm training class new job. Thankfully working home til mid next year weeks. 

But 2 weeks ago vaxxed dude starts coughing lot. cough got worse days went on. I‚Äôve never heard anyone coughing like life guy 27. He‚Äôs still coughing week later like that. he‚Äôs vaxxed doesn‚Äôt wear mask. Even weeks coughing. teacher made put one one day coughing hand. hasn‚Äôt worn one day since.  

Ever since started coughing people class coughing. Seems like someone new coughing everyday.  

A lady sits front today sneezed said ‚Äúomg idk whats happing sneezing feeling last days.‚Äù 

ARE FUCKING KIDDING ME. 

people goddamn selfish stupid angry. never want around people don‚Äôt choose around again. job doesn‚Äôt stay remote program ends next spring I‚Äôm quitting looking something else, despite amazing benefits.  

I cannot around strangers anymore. least 40 hours week. 

I‚Äôm freaking I‚Äôm gonna catch covid now. I‚Äôve double masking everyday week plan continue. Cough boy sitting near desk day put gloves wiped whole table like 40 Lysol wipes.  

I‚Äôm tired y‚Äôall üòû wonderlic test? get toddler flu shot flu bigger threat kids covid think guarantee all. Certainly know future ""variants"" be. current Delta pandemic, could easily bring things high baseline (10k-100k daily cases) heading fall, see large case spikes last fall weather gets cooler.

Until really large number people either vaccinated caught delta, going go baseline endemic levels. honestly feel bad people all. drank koolaid despite every opportunity decline multiple people begging so. Yeah agree. gets little overblown around here. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget still send hospital‚Äù acceptable risk comes Covid people. vaccines me, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll fine. Delta going push us back another year.

And focusing that, unvaccinated (including without access vacxine) going variant factories.

Who knows variants like... never going over. Hopefully get point spreading much quickly, covid stay I'm afraid.   Yes, switching topic talk data. would argue constructive *Coronavirus* subreddit lightning cars. 

But point, it‚Äôs expect sub. one memory care facility Grand Junction area, 16 fully vaccinated residents infected four died, according CDC slide provided Associated Press. residents died described hospice care, median age 93, indicating particularly CDC released findings investigation publicly, said plans publish results upcoming Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report. slide shared AP person involved internal deliberations, requested anonymity permission release 16 fully vaccinated residents infected memory care facility, CDC found 13 developed symptoms, described mild cases.

I don‚Äôt think deaths investigating though. you‚Äôre right. didn‚Äôt think Fortune valid source here.  According what? seen single abstract suggest conclusion. Ooh! got perfect person head that--Owen Wilson! Thanks clarifying I'm tired. We'll mask public indoor spaces, otherwise largely going back life normal. 

We're vaccinated risk small. risk children also apparently pretty small even new variants. I'm going keep sequestering benefit anti-vax assholes protect themselves. comes instant spazz fake fauci flip flop crowd. *Developing situation? mean? want things stay exactly same! Sunday Monday Happy Days!* clearly didn‚Äôt watch live. literally tried walk line cautious realistic. even said would much pushback sort centralized federal mandate. going virus literally going mutate ad Infinitum. It‚Äôs never going go away. choice learn live it. early Israeli numbers indicate 40%ish chance getting infected vaccine delta. includes asymptomatic cases. We're seeing vaccinated cases serious disease too. Much lower rates unvaccinated health risks prudent distance mask inside. Thanks kind words. Hopefully soon something argue lunch whomever without vaccination first thought. Wow, that's incredible. can't even imagine frustrating must vaccines easily accessible yet many choosing get them. ""Service"" members...how Orwellian. joke. Yeah, anyone remember seventh branch military? NYPD! magic anecdotal evidence exactly? kid stay home Surface cleaning doesn‚Äôt anything hardly. spreads air. Israel used Pfizer believe Pfizer Moderna prevalent UK. think us happy vaccines effective reducing number severity cases. However, recent signs last weeks seem least worrying worthy closer look. 

If making public health policy affecting lives hundreds millions billions people, need certain feet ground really going on. see anyone possibly object that. still limited supply till Mid late April though. I'm fully vaxxed still wear mask public. like people recognize one know stops chat store want get stuff go LOL. Also want get cold even mild case COVID. Wearing mask never bothered figure keep wearing til damn pandemic over. easy mask makes feel less worried catching virus. got laid pandemic I'm busy job hunting. time get sick. I've legit saying entire time, one listen me! I'm fully vaccinated, 17 health conditions. 10 year old can't vaccinated home. town's anti-vax. Delta it'd different story, variants lot unvaccinated individuals I'm really feeling it... 

Even die, eating disorder lose taste smell totally screw eating/weight set back years therapy. I'm super thankful workplace requires masks, college I'm concerned panic attacks due 100-200 indoor lecture halls unmasked students want party year isolation... Doctor here. detailed answer point. nuance. People want yes no, would certainly make things easier, honest truth spectrum protection measures. 

Like wiping groceries. We‚Äôve said No, detailed answer is, highly highly highly highly highly highly unlikely get COVID groceries it‚Äôs reasonable wipe down. 

To go date analogy, would reasonable answer ‚ÄúI might consider going date pick activity enjoy, put effort getting know me, clean up, etc‚Äù  interacting older at-risk.

This big one me. work adults living RCFs wearing masks anytime I've left home since January 2020. Recently (despite beginning surge cases area--Springfield, MO) staff telling ""You *do realize* wear masks anymore, right?""

I asked realized many facilities work easily could carrier care facilities. shrugged off... What's even worse 90% RCF staff unvaccinated around Springfield, Ozark, Nixa, Branson. need compare control group. 88% represents uplift protection vs. group 16000 unvaccined people. I'm sure, unfortunately. ""Return Normalcy"". Same. I‚Äôm still work home don‚Äôt public transit crowds. I‚Äôm masking gas station get coffee I‚Äôm tentatively eating restaurants non-peak times 2-3 times month. don‚Äôt close interactions at-risk people. kid back pre-k back bringing home snotty noses boogery coughs. start living lives again, slowly, cautiously, surely.    There‚Äôs earthly way 100% discount possibility maybe lab accident.  age well...  Hopefully not, open everything up. vaccinated nursing home ,chances probably pretty fragile say least. nursing home grandma stayed used less ""lockdown"" every year flu despite majority residence getting vaccinated it. I'd willing bet breakthrough cases get recorded going forward elderly there's whole lot trying ensure people working vaccinated maybe frequent booster shots elderly fully vaccinated COVID. 
Granted, symptoms probably bad would vaccinated still feel pretty terrible.

So yes, vaccines work also, still get it. Canada would like word.  missing whole point conversation self proclaimed hypochondriac - people stopped masking vaccinated nearly always told experts CDC ok, selfish morons don‚Äôt care people. 

The whiny baby you. 99% people hospital Covid unvaccinated. 99%! stat enough get vaccinated, vaccinated people wear masks? makes sense. Haha thanks. failing acronym game. could catch it, care make catching likely possibility.

I'd worry edge leakage various procedural oopses, along healthy concerns distancing exposure double masked, that's me. add this, numbers seeing probably waaay lower, won‚Äôt getting tested help it. extreme situations. Why? Serious question. you‚Äôre vaccinated, mask gives benefit. Residential care facility asinine way thinking. Nothing 100%. even hazmat suits. masks *something*. game probabilities like anything else life. one maskless interaction someone infected, chances catching virus might (as example) 80%. wear mask, might drop 50%. wear mask, might drop 25%. probabilities add large scale make significant difference. Imagine much higher numbers would without precautions. too. I‚Äôm lowest vaxed parish all. Fuck No. wearing mask you‚Äôre near unmasked individual. yeah, that's touch doctor article is. fucking ALABAMA, one poorest states America, like everyone calls schedules appointment primary care doctor chit chat COVID vaccine. lmao. All? define 'getting hit'? [New According Worldometers, New Zealand lower 7-day average cases 18 Aug 2020, remained 10 fewer daily cases since 22 April 2020. Active cases 56 higher mid-April 2021. deaths since February. would call pretty damn well managed. wonder life like New Zealand early June 2020 hit ZERO active cases.

Sure probably incredibly hard &amp; ship probably sailed early 2020 world, next best 'shot' getting eligible people vaccinated &amp; keep Rt 0.8 (nice little buffer case small outbreak) 6+ months. kidding? 30% US getting vaccine take long time get kind vaccine numbers globally. Oh well. Living COVID goes, guess... story literally Vegas... ok.

But agree sentiment overall, particularly movement going flexibility, wfh, remote, etc. think see greater impact.   Increased again? Brazil finally getting lower cases back 50k? What‚Äôs going there. isn‚Äôt even wave , cases remain consistently high Saint strong word. Everyone likes appreciated work, teachers get shit pretty continuously. nice stop while. wish mods held people accountable states compile data. must realized voters viewers ones dying now. r/thatsthejoke üôÑ could read they‚Äôd upset! Based anecdotal evidence recent data coming breakthrough clusters, it‚Äôs becoming clear need massive shift understanding benefits vaccine. People still seemingly shocked get sick vaccination, going become increasingly common coming weeks. 

You‚Äôre going able avoid potential Covid exposure new world ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù isn‚Äôt realistic, matter much others wear mask. vaccine best defense though ensure get it, it‚Äôll nuisance rather something life threatening.   Well, make seem suspicious all. vaccine work breeds complacency. still get covid even you‚Äôre fully vaccinated! please wear mask! didn‚Äôt say point virus type attack systems. said modern day deadly pandemic requires intensive care high death rates possibility severe life altering complications. illnesses characteristics.

Cancelling them? Ah ok see head space is.  anyone know whether vaccine companies updating vaccines new strains/variants (e.g. delta)? believe happens flu shot, updated season. I've read vaccine companies talking booster shot, tell, seems another shot original vaccine.

My assumption updating mRNA vaccines would much easier something like flu shot (though lengthy testing process would likely stay same).  sympathy he's really going projecting. frustration. doctor describing experiences right people intubated, lot people probably died.  vaccinated also spread it. year pandemic, really sympathy people refuse get vaccinated. 

I'm really tired thing. Vaccines safe, proven, Covid19 one free.

A month ago I‚Äôd agree

Now it‚Äôs inevitable. Get ready. Better roll sleeve bud anticipate weeks stressing importance vaccination, hell even conservative media members Congress curiously started singing different tune vaccine week, *then* CDC gonna walk back recent masking guidance get real Delta. think they‚Äôre slow try account psychology (and stupidity) general populace‚Ä¶ way humanity shown it‚Äôs full ass past year half, understandable. Shouldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶wow getting vaccinated highly effective vaccines global pandemic‚Ä¶.who would‚Äôve guessed would pay extra go place knew enforcing this. Wow. 55%? whole lotta death visit country. Holy shit.  virus ridiculously transmissible. Everyone us likely get point. knows much transmissible next variant be? 

Y'all idiots running towards nearest vaccination clinic RIGHT NOW. monoclonals exactly? getting donor blood others COVID, type medication, something else? Care share studies?

Are talking 80% protection reinfection, actual 20% reinfection rate - different. (80% protection reinfection real world setting pretty good case!)

Are trying bring marine study published Lancet?

Are aware studies show vaccinating previous infection, led reduction cases? track 50k cases today, thanks anti-vaxxers problem need least month get fully vaccinated - meaning vulnerable Delta gotten bad enough changed mind. Kinda odd gop conservative media saying get vaxxed I'm Canadian too. (Ontario). found CDC change curious situation like us.

They dont make easy find stuff!

But find .pdf PHO government site defines ""breakthough cases"". (Cases order identify cases symptom onset date receipt vaccine (i.e. post-vaccination cases), vaccine uptake data extracted Ontario Ministry Health‚Äôs (MOH) COVaxON application linked case data extracted MOH‚Äôs Public Health Case Contact Management Solution (CCM).

So that's starts.

But notice says ""cases symptom onset date""?  cases symptoms - ""asymptomatic cases""?

A little mentions asymptomatic since timing infection (i.e. date infection, approximated symptom onset date) relative vaccination (i.e. date dose administration) unclear asymptomatic cases, possible asymptomatic cases infected prior vaccination may post-vaccination cases.

And defines ""breakthrough case"" fully vaccinated (i.e., fully vaccinated) case: **Cases symptom onset date** 14 days following receipt second dose 2-dose series COVID-19 vaccine 14 days following first dose COVID-19 vaccine

So seems asymptomatic cases counted ""cases"" vaccinated, way *havent* vaccinated.

All changing criteria really makes difficult make comparisons data! Ok, sounds promising. always complaining it, fidgeting it. :) even need ID US citizen resident track got shot? Sounds strange. That‚Äôs fucking assault.

As doc makes mad. I'm sure YouTube videos much accurate basic biology classes.  seem like much compared positive tests coming back week, lag next week much worse. feel bad healthcare professionals. Yeah think unvaccinated people died hospitalized totally avoided whatever nasty side effects vaccine would had! /s hope person arguing right troll, account doesn‚Äôt seem like it. suspect might traumatized pandemic lashing fear response result. show friggin awful mind, could elaborate circumstances, like comorbidities activities post-vaccination? I'm sorry loss.  Could also reporting issues.  **Jul. 22, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Found American Idiots! Many trolls one forcing get vaccinated. It‚Äôs free country, right put what‚Äôs body. However, doesn‚Äôt mean actions don‚Äôt consequences! means businesses right mandate policies! Perhaps referring single dose AZ? 

 
 previously said first dose either vaccine around 33% effective symptomatic disease Delta variant. plausible explanation there's big gap partially vaccinated fully vaccinated states like California? People forgot get second dose? live someone high risk area low vaccination rates. never comfortable honor system public places don‚Äôt want risk taking virus home. point, unless intubation death actually happen immediate family members, people see truth.  Pfizer vaccine fully effective second dose, 14 days. going ventilator, body already knows virus fighting it.

Reason many people second dose worst first body ""fighting"" vaccine learning time. putting vaccine Covid infected body make things worse. effective ways fight covid.

Maybe infection - boost immunity even more. ‚ÄúEvery society three meals away chaos.‚Äù

But, believe science, sequencing statistics, know certainty years.  I'm fully vaccinated, always wear mask indoors even outdoors crowded areas sometimes. takes little offers protection people around me. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs psychopathic all.

Many lost family members *because of* people like never took covid seriously. people don‚Äôt care. don‚Äôt care enough protect us right thing.

Most people unvaccinated firmly literally every mitigation strategy‚Äîvaccine mandates passports, mask mandates, etc. putting family risk time can‚Äôt bear lose anyone else.

There‚Äôs county Florida 20% fully vaccinated lol ( yea know it‚Äôs small still ). took 6-8 hours start feeling second Moderna. protects getting virus completely protect getting virus though. true them. States need like Missouri Florida won‚Äôt circumstances, states don‚Äôt currently need like CA, Oregon, Northeast region probably already considering it. hate Florida.we start school 2 weeks. Yay! /s friends fully vaccinated, would fine party. understand hesitancy though. Probably easier get fake ID would rather put side effects vaccine worry complications covid. Nah fuck parade, quickly forget DJT's statements (a couple weeks 6th Twitter ban, maybe? IIRC) basically saying ""[America] Thank Vaccines!!!1! Operation Warp Speed, blah blah blah.""
As much shitstain upon history is, I'll give credit due. Broken clock, 2x/day whatnot... think meant even unvaccinated ditched masks, despite guidance applying fully vaccinated individuals. it?  never stopped  see logic planning strategic part year, going 100 0 way seemed foolhardy. let much population get exposed once? Staggered reopening, difficult, would still given us benefit time get people vaccinated. Yep, ongoing myth... Got it. We're page then. nothing racism. 
i willing cut grandmother life didn‚Äôt listen doctor get vaccine. she‚Äôs immune compromised, survived colon cancer diabetes, plus she‚Äôs nineties now. distrustful vaccine first convince get it.  England focused first doses opened vaccinations young people recently. much better vaccinations. US whole world... fourth wave hit poorest countries most. Got stick libs even means million dead, ya know? (tragic sarcasm real) You‚Äôre afraid injecting ‚Äúforeign chemicals‚Äù form lifesaving vaccine, yet you‚Äôre totally cool injecting foreign chemicals steroids sake vanity powerlifting. Lol, fucking joke people are. Fully vaccinated Canuck - betcha. folks province raising stink vaccinations guarantee social circles shrink echo chamber. Extremely unlikely. worth losing sleep over. far understand it, 4122 cumulative breakthrough cases July 13. 

1300 new breakthrough cases July 7 July 13. 7707 total new cases July 7 July 13. guessing people probably fit profile elderly/immunocompromised/ unhealthy people also die things like flu. reduce risk 20 fold still risk infirm. younger people would think risk dying vaccinated small, approaches 0. whole world currently ""backsliding."" Delta variant whole new ballgame. Considering it‚Äôs endemic never will. say like foolish drop masks known better - told listen experts science. told see family holidays, wear masks social distance vaccines - fault people listening say it‚Äôs safe?  Ok well couple weeks behind England, spiking pretty severely. Hospitals already filling cities going red zone. know college kids Forte make responsible decisions erring side caution harm anything. thing could see masks affecting college experience making randos, learning experience. work industry social depend lot relationships people mask negative impacts unless Qtips come start freaking out. piece cloth mouth nose, blindfold. blows mind US cities locking many cases. Adelaide, Australia 1 (1!) case couple days later city went 7 day lockdown. Weeoowww
*Owen Wilson voice* I'd say vaccine reducing lot symptoms (or preventing symptoms) reducing contagion risk lot.

Probably best health professional could chime in, feel I'm spreading shitty message.

Basically : feel safe vaccine. haven‚Äôt guys heard put tracker makes magnetized üòí. stupidity people get vaccinated you‚Äôre eligible. new surge eligible haven‚Äôt got vaccine. walk grocery store get free. quick update original post might research he's talking about.  mean, also largely 4th July spike? Numbers tad higher June 15th didn‚Äôt really start shooting week 4th, trend pretty much universal across us Smh Absolutely!

I‚Äôm glad inner circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è got vaccine üíâ 

One us came positive thankfully fully vaccinated symptoms mild We've lost. 
All us redditors losers. voices heard Majesty Queen President. world's social media warnings heard desire games. 
The Olympics held. 
They ignore many deaths, tears around world, laughing. 
The games show political stability elections. 
Political corruption, donations, status, favoritism friends. got $900 far. That's price life. 
People raise voice. Why? know demonstrations arrested. mainstream media's TV Twitter hijacked government. election system already dead. country? 
Welcome Japan. reads like something made up. best anecdote people hate cops reddit get karma! seems like science back claim vaccinated need wear masks. Common sense hand seems say whole lot people refusing get vaccine wear face mask even though supposed they've face masks pretty much entire time. vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% bullet proof shield virus? help body catch it. theory help spread stop mutations stay lower body better fighting first place? never even enters body spread? assumed meant lower got it. yeah, maybe it‚Äôs edited appear way. mostly unvaccinated point cares, get vaccine problem.

You care.  don‚Äôt think idiot. Anxiety fear real things. I‚Äôm going say vaccinated course talk healthcare provider. me, surprised simple everything vaccine. setup well organized isn‚Äôt confusing difficult. Maybe someone go you? might help.

I mild side effects (sore arm fell asleep 12 hours) sister ill first shot 24 hours, fine second shot. It‚Äôs unpredictable far. (My sister took Advil Tylenol drank fluids slept day. fine 24-36 hours vaccine.)

With contagious variant like delta it‚Äôs getting harder harder avoid getting infected. get infected, better outcome vaccinated. It‚Äôs proactive get vaccine.

Honestly it‚Äôs understandable people anxiety would issues around vaccine people still think it‚Äôs hoax.  Measles erradicated, made non-issue US.

It flares anti-vaxers created enough undervaxination travel case lands unprotected population take hold.

That happens certain areas around NYC certain insular groups, dangerously poised happen rather affluent private schools parents experience debilitating contagious illness think they've never personally seen it, state officials writing mandates worrying things lost history. never stopped wearing masks. L.A. Times best source this. 

I usually keep another browser open paywalls. clear history.  Also Canada allowing fully vaccinated Americans visit also motivates people want visit. absolutely correct, giving Israeli study weight simply farther along terms vaccination Delta exposure. country best vaccination rollout would imagine would present us upper bounds benefit vaccine. honestly hope fluke, coming saying anything, overestimating Pfizer protection Delta due sample bias. ü§∑   wear mine, even 2 shots, part, gets anti vaxers not. 

Are La La Land. Watching Fox UnNews  wearing properly fitted N95 masks, government ever mandated public.

If need wear feel safe going daily life, knock out. Thanks! Great call stocking up. got extra filters RZ masks (seals around face), bought large bottles legit hand sanitizer became widely available. case it, buffer aren‚Äôt SOL need get gas such. He‚Äôs literally spoken vaccination, fucks sake. he‚Äôs racist shithead. article says Pfizer 88% effective symptomatic disease. 

That effective--much effective anyone thought vaccines would even wildtype, effective approved vaccines (e.g. J+J US) found clinical trials. he's refusing play venue unless take safety bars windows keep people lean crowd accidentally falling out. ReSaErch!!!1! Also let's forget variant changed infectious, lethal. actually next stage wiping viruses. mutate infectious actually sign infection rates going which. surprised get omega variant much higher communicability .001 percent severe cases media still say pandemic. lied, much likely Lol They‚Äôve made part personality. one replied talking symptomatic efficacy think way: good practice isolated adulthood.  would call going business everything would normally mask indoors others pretending pandemic ""living fear"". 

Mask simplest, easiest, least invasive, effective thing do. Covid absolutely still hospitalized get large enough dose it, vaccine not. still cause serious, long term complications, vaccine not. still lot there. Nothing ever make truly safe, applies pretty much everything life. best mitigate risks, somewhere also need make risk assessment decide ""safe enough"".

But yeah, good point 100% protected say, good aware of. yeah that's one. virus made realize 1. fucking dumb lot people US are. 2. much hate people including family members. many times someone made stupid remark MuH fReEdOm wanted go off. I've considered it, me. point death immediate circle friends get remaining people vaccinate think. It‚Äôs ironic there‚Äôs story misinformation front page people still buy woman‚Äôs ridiculous story.  Quick question: wear mask entire life flu season? (Prior covid)  One big difference vaccine side effects respond well OTC treatment. Pfizer dose 2 kicking ass took Tylenol things got better quickly that. Yes, that‚Äôs nurses doctors covid ward get vaccine walk around maskless. It‚Äôs magic. vaccine fact make safe - that‚Äôs get Ya vaccinated wore mask 3rd week second dose way hell I‚Äôm going back point it‚Äôs idiots don‚Äôt want get vaccinated hospital good luck study showing worse outcomes, increased transmissability kids? Ah... many. Definitely going shopping, indoor concerts, nightclubs, sports venues, etc. 2nd dose Tuesday, I'm still fully vaccinated yet. Case numbers rising extremely quickly UK, Delta 200% transmissible Alpha. WFH really go supermarket food/drink. 

I wanted rent room London summer (rates low, many moved back Europe Brexit service industry losing many workers), I'm summer pretty delightful. *If* (feeling bit cautious, still), I'll enjoy art galleries, museums, maybe concerts go back house people frail.

Alternatively, could stay days brother who's near London. wife working public every day way through, poorly slightest. anyone stay with, days might've exposed?

I guess early say definitely give them, got mild dose. I've reading people getting mild dose passing partners, think might risk. Frustrating, is.  He's super dumb. days ago, read 24 year old got double lung transplant. die, guess what? chances surviving next five years drops 50%. Sounds like moderna. same. rough lasts 24 hours. Hope feel better! Sadly that‚Äôs reality.

Before virus produced smaller quantities, actions taken protect kids.

Now production virus way up, it‚Äôs way transmissible, little protections place kids.

It‚Äôs bad. fucking assholehead guy is. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Hahahaaahahahahahaajshass Seriously ! 30 something son giving story. Last one ‚Äú well I‚Äôm going die even get ‚Äú. ??!! WTF ? may kill there‚Äôs , jk ! really hearing lot 30-something group. We, family, contemplating ‚Äò intervention ‚Äò.... deaths people age 50, 30 age 80. Thirteen deaths people ages 65 79, six ages 50 64, Leusner 27 deaths people underlying conditions, 17 cardiovascular disease, seven diabetes nine cancer immunocompromised conditions, said. Five chronic lung conditions, three chronic kidney disease, one chronic liver disease five others listed ‚Äúother chronic diseases.‚Äù people died one underlying means vaccines **99.999% effective** preventing deaths due COIVD-19.‚Äù

Bolding mine. [This UK shows symptomatic efficacy double dose Pfizer/BioNTech decreased 94% (Alpha) 88% (Delta). definitely decrease, still pretty damn high.

Remember year ago, hoping vaccine least 50% efficacy? Looks like right according CNN! That‚Äôs easy say, going go? far going travel emergency care, space available get there?

I agree sentiment. It‚Äôs difficult believe what‚Äôs happening here. CDC dropped 15k day. Idk number aren‚Äôt dropping ^ Posts r/mgtow2  strictly talking hospitalized people post. Sure, know true data vaccine's true efficacy that's discussing that. Instead hospitalization data. 98% patients unvaccinated already pretty significant data.  brother law works hospital New Orleans says nurses refusing vaccine message contained mRNA different? would cause body produce slightly different spike proteins slight difference could cause difference efficacy. That‚Äôs trying say. shouldn‚Äôt assume anything. lots variables.

Everyone apparently thinks one kind mRNA earth. Thanks! grateful science. Yeah, vaccination long term solution.  probably concern people's medical privacy. lot vaccination centers set way see patients center want people photographing other. call ahead let know use phone's text speech function (or whatever use) accommodate disability able make sure option. guess been. little freaked whole situation really wanted police person leave Blabla. risk kids really miniscule, numbers say. random event Mississippi changes nothing. risk kids give COVID unvaccinated older people. something need look prevent.  people like complain parrot talking points. Americans particular great parroting talking points given tvs. 

Also inconvenience apparently gigantic burden. Maybe patient privacy reasons, ensure people recording taking photos people getting vaccines? ...or Covid caught spike proteins vaccine shedders given Covid. least making crazy actually mask public.....to protect 'vaccinated'. 

Don't know whether laugh cry. Nope. people call car insurance get policy accident. common sense common. Im guessing parties Statistics mind-bender remember statistics look Reddit, many people anecdotal experience COVID due low case fatality rate simply see similar cold. Anecdotal experience POWERFUL. vaccinated person currently quite ill suspected Delta variant symptoms‚Ä¶can confirm. Going back masks -hate- sick. I'm curious, getting 200K cases per day figure from? crazy, one people. Drove random rural town 3 hours away, hundreds people like, 90% St. Louis.   think there's 9000 cases entire state since February üòÇ point, think public mask mandates form hygiene theatre. real infection risk person walked past grocery store. family birthday party attended cousin's house. Mask mandates stop massive case spike last December January problem people exchanging virus Christmas dinner table. family, uncle scrupulously careful masking public, ended catching COVID went friend's house dinner caught friend. Public mask mandates helpful unless also come ban visiting people's homes, that's going happen.

&amp;#x200B;

NY Contract tracing proved exactly that. Pretty much spread public venues ventilation, house parties close quarters indoor activity. Pseudo-uridinylated RNA Pfizer/Moderna Curevac Results higher doses mRNA able given vaccine, numerous animal studies many years (many done Katalin Kariko) modification RNA, body naturally mRNA, results efficient translation, likely better directed immune response. vaccines couldnt anything different I'm back wearing mask even though I'm vaccinated. worth risk not. That's anti-vaxer talking point comes every time there's new vaccine (it particularly prominent HPV vaccine released). Vaccine-group volunteers trial became pregnant rate received placebo similar pregnancy outcomes. would contact doctor, safe hospital medical facility require 100% vaccination compliance employees, would seek care elsewhere. shows core inept clue doing. Sure. back lock 6, 2 weeks later. 7. 8. 9. We're unvaccinated nation. Thank you. difficult especially developed sever post-partum depression, good now. I‚Äôm Asian, Asians wear masks time fucking idiot  absolutely false information. Nothing anti-vaccine propaganda. stop spreading even know true? One country's studies indicative virus large. Remember Pfizer effective Delta Israeli studies nearly everywhere else still effective?

Just one country reports something mean applicable world large.   Might disrupt 5g

(Seriously, though, can't see would require this, unless people's distraction disrupted workload before)  CDC doesn‚Äôt know whether shit go blind.    Maybe help... country Taiwan vaccines? honest can't win either way.

Positive headline: ""THE MEDIA WORKING GOVERNMENT CONTROL US!!!"" mean vaccine would target fertility exactly? *HIPAA, that's definitely root cause %change one common ways manipulate statistics. You‚Äôre definitely right preferring cases per 100k it‚Äôs way compare across states across time intuitive way here. Huh? mean reckless unvaccinated? get mandates schools many kids might ineligible It‚Äôs almost like don‚Äôt want know. deal was: get shot get life back. gave year half life protect others. I‚Äôm going back lockdown. nearly ruined marriage. choose get vaxxed, that‚Äôs you. anyone brings immunocompromised kids I‚Äôm going lose too. Billions can‚Äôt sacrificed millions. I‚Äôll wear mask see someone masked store put mine want good citizen. shit can‚Äôt go forever. Blame people didn‚Äôt get vaccinated punish them, people right thing. End rant.  changing mentality kids unaffected virus it‚Äôs big deal consider welfare. 

Like metric ton people sub argue consistent basis. Many doses Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna administered worldwide Even numbers plateau, believe it? He's done everything rig numbers make look less serious actually is. think vaccines would provide sterilizing immunity since day one it‚Äôs said purpose? wildly successful even lower efficacy Delta. also got J&amp;J. spoke doctor recommend getting another shot official guidance released. recent study you‚Äôre likely referring also based lab samples blood 10 people used anti bodies metric. Personally I‚Äôm gonna wait official recommendation real world data  Vaccinated people completely understand pandemic absolutely still wearing masks. 

Why think vaccinated people would mask wearing? minor inconvenience. Moderna really used US, bit Canada. Pfizer worldwide.  I‚Äôve flat said family &amp; friends spend time people unvaccinated. want enter death lottery, it.

Tbf, many people trash headlines project sorts malicious intent onto ‚Äúthe media‚Äù sh-t can‚Äôt bothered actually read. It‚Äôs lazy af. range efficacy infections delta anywhere 64%-88% still monumentally effective vaccines modern medicine. Remember, vaccines don‚Äôt prevent infections; meant make disease manageable. Even delta variant, Covid MNRA vaccine maybe one effective vaccines ever made. People need calm down. Anecdotal experience POWERFUL

And literally reason scientific method statistics invented. gives us clear picture reality instead self confirming lies brains evolved tell us. don‚Äôt know anything really believe garbage little blue face masks everyone wears effective thing lmao Yo, I'm trying rude, really know tactful way saying this:

It seems know ""breakthrough case"" is. Breakthrough cases occur fully vaccinated individuals.

The poster worried breakthrough cases plausible (likely? guaranteed?) create evolutionary pressure (or whatever want call it) towards variants evade vaccines more. theory split population like US much better breeding grounds variants evade vaccine locations basically one vaccinated dominant variants become whatever effective unvaccinated people anything that's ultra effective real advantage variants without boon. antivax, bit HIV-AIDS denialism January 2000, Nate Mendel led benefit concert Hollywood AIDS denialist group Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives speech founder Christine Maggiore free copies self-published book, Everything Thought Knew AIDS Wrong?[19][20] Additionally, band's official website featured section devoted Alive &amp; Well.[21] Sandra Thurman, director Office National AIDS Policy stated ""extraordinarily irresponsible behavior"" ""[t]here doubt link HIV AIDS respected scientific community.""[22] Links references Alive &amp; Well removed band's website March issue doctors bigger people this, literally matter "" legal age adult humans kicking screaming toddler would brains grasp cooperation resisting help"" post article find number unvaccinated died? headline might trust National Review, source info article woman‚Äôs Thank wear mine indoors I'm trying example I'm fully vaccinated.  think working though one person laughed get looks.

This state 38% fully vaccinated zero masks delta popped around.   told sub learn ""speak politician"", means person even works government (whether politician not) says anything less outright condemning act putting mask, means saying actually full-throated endorsement full-scale national mask mandates.

There lot people want mask mandate badly can't understand things qualifiers. Israeli data still place, reported way worse efficacy days ago. 70% actually still pretty decent. 
Kinda ironic Israel got priority access vaccine doses earlier year intention deliver high-quality data Biontech/Pfizer. pandemic nearly everything neen politicized America one party, ‚Äúpolitical comments‚Äù allowed here, so: meh. fine effort reach herd immunity. hope enjoy dancing around truth.

/s might little behind recent news. links think wakeup call another lost election conservatives, time many died could vote. based close contact. basically ventilation situation. aerosols therefore virus concentrates air enclosed spaces, ventilation major factor increase amount time. outside better. IIRC, rabies also bit oddity virus infection progresses slowly. administered right away, immune response vaccine fast enough outpace gets hold becomes deadly.  Seriously - least last year could lie pretend patients cautious. 

Now know people running ragged blocking medical care listen talk radio, think cousin‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs opinion matter doctors leading experts. 

The docs know breaking, even more-so Christmas peak, it‚Äôs awful. Honestly sure republican talking point vaccines changed 3 days ago, better late never. Hopefully get enough people vaccinated avoid mutation worse delta saw extended family posting Disneyland FL last week. Looked packed, obviously masks, sure often indoors, lot lines wait indoors long periods time. think that's choice balance risk reward. example, working might improve immune system overall health, avoiding classes might reduce risk catching covid.

There's right choice, r0 8/9 delta variant, one safe going get better. likely going continue circulating perpetuity. well might case. person ask themselves. stop masking distancing it‚Äôs actually over? bareface early risk [insert reason]?

I‚Äôm certainly losing mask continues affect country I‚Äôm living in. Good analogy. playing probability&amp;statistics, understand probastatistics. I'm vaccinated continue wear mask ""over"". I'll let others populate statistics. Cries Johnson johnson. got first shot available, consider getting mrna? I've wondering awhile? even eligible it? make difference?

Don't frame opinion fact. society may decide let personal freedoms prevail safety stable healthcare system. saying wise, option. means attempting limit spread accomplished limiting human interaction virus.

This simply false. Vaccines help limiting spread virus. Limitation human contact means *the only* way. It‚Äôs physics. politics.

The benefit get vaccine drastically lowering chance getting ill COVID-19. people get mildly ill people get severely ill somewhere between, even young people. young, Mildly ill still suck. example, sick week barely get toilet bed, mild life limiting persistent effects covid altered sense smell taste.

As dealing feeling nervous around needles, please tell person that's going vaccinate you, know do, making sure less nervous lie vaccine.
Also people feel better eat easily digestible snack treat getting poked needle. Chinese study preprint, tracking approximately 60 individuals delta found double viral load 60 individuals original version virus.  Individuals quarantined.

Do think people would feel staff gave old people Tuberculosis HIV? India incredibly strict lockdown get there. unlikely places see similar decline without lockdown. Wait really? get Covid govt would pay hospital went in, health insurance? Seriously? Hang inevitable reversal. Anyone uses ""real world"" like old school touch. Internet real world.

I‚Äôm one refused go, guess ‚Äúwe get back normal eventually‚Äù ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt stop living fear.‚Äù 

Odd arguments family considering go Florida every five years. I‚Äôve movie theater without mask couple times since vaccinated.

One word: asshat likely 0, probably unemployed govt health care (my basis utter stupidity assuming he‚Äôs working, know shouldn‚Äôt judge am) . think genome sequencing statistics pinpoint evolutionary history, combine geographic sampling, origin story discovered.

It even necessarily need cooperation Chinese government, chooses. data every countries, particularly surrounding SE Asia countries (and tbh, fairly confident case), missing one country, i.e., China, hinder much.

Again, things take time, everything right origin politics. Every party aggravated, no-side wants make even slight gesture ""retreat"". testing tracking key. faster track new variants different ‚Äúkey‚Äù, quicker build booster shot targeting multiple variants. Let‚Äôs say Redneck, USA Oh, things happen. It‚Äôs public figures mocking vaccine (while vaccinated) suddenly pushing it: they‚Äôre losing fans. study day showed hospitalization rates groups children (adolescent boys) higher vaccine side effects COVID itself.

I'm callin BS one provide link. probably right. states probably passed legislation protect virus carriers. Sigh.

Have really forgotten people sea couldn‚Äôt find ports would let dock start pandemic? delta variant thousand times transmissible, incubation times pared one third. investigation would communication knew virus shared world. matters hopefully immediate handling viral outbreaks next pandemic. 

I think ongoing investigations countries responded pandemic years. Obviously many countries made terrible mistakes starting US. initial mistakes persisted still effect response. False.

The idea vaccines work making get ""covid lite"" severely mistaken.

The main idea let resist exposure without getting sick.

Secondary - testable peak pandemic surveillance testing cohort possible - make least get sick, severe.

The ultimate protection however vaccine saturated population people less likely get infected less likely spread do, interacting people. live btw? 10x number likely back like March 2020 tests become available number dropped big time   Yeah garbage use statistics going early pandemic people dividing covid deaths ENTIRE POPULATION calling 99.999% survival rate, thus demonstrating covid really big deal.

Source: Cousin delta drop India happened fast. Like 380k day 100k month. wonder see fast drops places also Um ya! 2x vaxxed, immune system heavily compromised. Here's expert reminding need boosters soon. WEAR think case effective advertised case type people get selected studies versus general population. Also people understanding laws big numbers, statistics, fact people also died everyday pandemic. pushback second point CDC mentions wear mask vaccinated, which, states follow local guidelines, includes mask mandates.

People stuck point one point two either compute think show. think late anything useful. need work social discourse media consumption well government structures next crisis... please Well difference hesitant, antivaxers, voiced antivaxers think quite important. hesitant easier fix. antivaxers possible fix. vegans vaccines, loud antivaxers shut it, nearly impossible fix.

I'm sure us point lives gotten argument realised part way wrong still stuck guns save face. 

Can imagine culpability wrong something could kill you, spreading misinformation potentially killing others care about? 

That's everyday reality many antivaxers. Totally unwilling entertain possibility wrong something matters. 

As long shred ""evidence"" let voiced antivaxers escape personal culpability danger put people in, little done.   Paying people $100 seems working live. think exacerbating point made article. PCR tests 9-30% false negative rate, think many people actually positive COVID yet living completely normal lives. 24 year old also overweight particularly healthy. Wearing mask closed spaces? really understand wearing mask problem anyone. haven‚Äôt stopped wearing mask, don‚Äôt trust anyone. Sometimes stupid goes right bone. important thing I‚Äôve extrapolated vaccinated = less chance getting infected better odds surviving unvaccinated. that‚Äôs ignoring fact mutations typically take form infectious less deadly due evolutionary pressures keep spreading replicating without killing host.

That said, I‚Äôm idiot won‚Äôt say virus never ever mutated deadly strain, it‚Äôs definitely possible (and happened past), it‚Äôs tougher, due natural evolutionary pressure.

Testing important piece, currently, puzzle. Continuing make testing free easily available accurately monitor track spread mutations. classify losing sense smell severe effect. Either way, make public health policy based exceptions like these. Driving cars result death, ban cars, right? mRNA vaccines kind vaccines there. Large parts world used AZ, example. hopeful mRNA vaccines protect variants, would much rather worry all. that's unvaccinated, unfortunately. example, H1N1 caused far serious outcomes children COVID. magnitude 5x so. 

Right 18-39 year olds hovering around 50% vax rate. 65+ population 90%. 

It‚Äôs 18-39 year olds need move needle. 

It‚Äôs weird dynamic boomers done part once, it‚Äôs Reddit population seems opposite I've read past, suggested protection remained stable even 6+ months.  Still ain't fair. Also I'm pretty sure NJ and/or NEA requires teachers vaccinated? Yup programed base good. rule thumb parent: amount time takes break child's bad habit directly proportional amount time bad behavior exhibited. me, last month neighbor‚Äôs daughter (9) mild symptoms tested positive. parents teenage brothers, fully vaccinated never got sick showed symptoms. didn‚Äôt isolate daughter room, among fully vaccinated family.  think really starts ""individuality/freedom cult"" mentality taken US culture. highly invested notion, think really much exceptional individuals average bear. knowingly take bullshit positions issues express idea love nurture, trying convince sort martyr liberty. grandiose nonsense extreme, clinically presents less mental illness. It‚Äôs funny I‚Äôve taken flu shot every single year 21 years straight, so, got flu year got shot sept got flu late April, sure kind wore off, didn‚Äôt work.
So see it‚Äôs 50-55% effective it‚Äôs always 100 me. everyone family gets flu shot. don‚Äôt know single person real life who‚Äôs gotten flu vaccinated it.
But vaccines 70-90% it‚Äôs breakthrough left right.
It‚Äôs weird. clear I‚Äôm saying anything negative it‚Äôs wild difference contracting vac two much much different % protection. There's lot interest using mRNA flu, lot people quick forget they're lucky luck eventually runs out. manager pats back handled covid stating lot positive cases last year. Maybe that's work done sanitize building maybe require testing people admit they're sick. post article found Pfizer 88% effective Delta, saw this. also like 10% population United States (there‚Äôs less people Canada state California) 90%+ population concentrated southern region country. quite same. That's like, highest number I've seen Israel, lol. got Israel claiming 60-70% data, UK saying 80-88% theirs, rest seem signify lower 80s something similar. doctor trusts willing talk risks help convince get vaccine? mask thing big argument united states? either political fucking attack freedom.

The government decisive this, wear masks not.
And people stop brats, fucking mask.. wear damn thing. I'm fully vaccinated I'm back wearing mask public areas. That's minor inconvenience.

In two weeks go back work testing children public school setting. glasses fog sit right face making protocols difficult read. Phonological testing voices muffled. tests require lot talking wind quite breathless. since tests normed masks etc, scores suspect. state requires meet time lines.

 I'll still 100% think correct thing better option Covid, correct say minor inconvenience. research referring this: little credible cable news outlets think judging methods think one in-vitro. mRNA vaccine attacks spike protein, virus mutate completely evade vaccine would either. 

A) somehow mutate become different type virus 

B) Mutate evade vaccine longer able infect human cells.  

The efficacy wild type covid Delta went 95% 88% really significant.  ""Oh dear gawd, can't wear piece thin cloth face longer help others time crisis, soo terrible, hard narcissist self!!"" üò£üò£  Well, that's fair high-schoolers. I‚Äôm definitely going wear mask crowded indoor spaces least. went friends couple weeks ago immediately got super sick week. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated I‚Äôm entirely convinced wasn‚Äôt Delta variant since symptoms lined exactly, doctor said weren‚Äôt concerned testing (still little peeved that, whatever). I‚Äôm perfectly fine didn‚Äôt linger, either way I‚Äôm gonna start wearing mask case.

I initially camp ‚ÄúI part, got vaccinated, really don‚Äôt want wear again.‚Äù brutally sick week, sure was, I‚Äôm ok returning extra precautions. Well obviously **not medical advice** think concerned enough data studied mixing vaccines. People kept saying Pfizer Moderna identical mRNA another mRNA vaccine terrible efficacy (can't think name). 

I know countries like Canada mixing shortages think ideal situation. sure downvoted. Couldn‚Äôt agree more. mask cloth. It‚Äôs inhibitor concerts, restaurants, bars, plays, many things people live for. you‚Äôre unvaccinated don‚Äôt legit reason vaccinated, live consequences. Right?! hard would start article ""out 4931 deaths since December, 49 unvaccinated"" there's perspective article. speaks regular basis. gets coverage things bad. incorrect assumption long COVID, effects COVID mentioned earlier comment, happen severe cases COVID. Even mild cases result long COVID long term effects mentions above. People vaccinated infected reported lose smell. 

The vaccines amazing. Everyone get vaccinated can. Nope. capitalist mega donor realize losing money shut downs. likelihood so. made bunch phone calls bingo, fell line police going enforce certainly expect minimum wage retail worker so. might even say yuge.  DeSantis, year half late change stances now. 

He changing stances vaccines, though? never vaccines, lockdowns. 6 month old article expresses gratitude, vaccine rollout Fyi somewhat true people alpha varient Delta varient symptoms much flu-like. influx people wanting mask mandates regardless vaccination status 
I‚Äôm curious data much protection masking give vaccinated people? 

I‚Äôm staunch supporter vaccinated people wearing mask remain way unless something completely left happens curious know data that‚Äôs there. Yeah...there definitely something going behind scenes know nothing (right now). Steve Scalise got (publicly) vaccinated days ago, give payday. Way needlessly waste tens thousands dollars. shut fiscal responsibility on?  Nope Well, can‚Äôt answer far covid goes, weeklong stay severe pnuemonia 8 years ago billed $200k. 4 days ventilator. exceptional insurance paid nothing. wouldn‚Äôt cheap current insurance, yearly cap $8k.

Definitely recommend experience even worst enemy vile person earth. I‚Äôd vaccinate weekly avoid repeating it. (Turns sedation vent isn‚Äôt always reliable migraines suck even worse can‚Äôt demand pain meds.)  Apparently one smarter people group finally figured rapidly killing constituents. Can't get voted there's nobody vote in! I've made point agree comment I‚Äôve never thought way. We‚Äôre used thinking anti-vaxxers sowing distrust vaccines. you‚Äôre arguing they‚Äôve also successfully sown distrust unvaccinated people, many harder reach they‚Äôve broadly demonized.

Exactly. necessarily see Biden administration fast-tracking full approval vaccine good thing. anti-vaxxers going spin ""being rushed"" going turn people mistrust government reasons nothing vaccines. 

I've got point dislike term ""vaccine hesitancy"". One, presumes main reason people get vaccines hesitant, rather barrier. Two, presumes people hesitant must dislike vaccines, fact may hesitant people general. Cringe. honestly feel like likely answer. Republicans getting vaccinated result 99+% deaths right now.

In effect, virus going around killing Republicans, good future election chances.  I'm confused point. Can't cure stupid.   get vaccine multiple primary school teacher friends, almost breaks amongst students, however, none 30% kids come test positive. lead school contract tracing, turns kids tested positive play dates sleep overs... pretty much shows masks work??  Thank you!!  Well, you‚Äôre right, need get vaccines travel adult, flu tetanus boosters recommended, yeah, people huge fucking babies injections many whatever justify way one. anti-vaccine automatically disqualify working healthcare field. Obviously, paying attention understand basic principles underlying profession. Delta variant affecting young people original covid variant does.  Florida‚Äôs Attorney General got covid despite vaccinated. She‚Äôs hospital (and she‚Äôs young, unlikely outcome even without vaccine), dislike DeSantis, like taking air base might made covid breakthrough case. 

Now headline DeSantis instead prominent breakthroughs. lot younger people lesser sense mortality. Since surviving breast cancer 35, I‚Äôm aware human body vulnerable resilient. lot younger people haven‚Äôt experienced much former. older are, don‚Äôt take time health granted. exact boat week ago. started regaining sense taste smell within week hope goes you. Florida tried hard hide deaths. stopped reporting numbers manipulated numbers make things look better long time ago. Curious, vaccinated? Unless vaccines available country? reason Netherlands German high incidence list countries (more 200 per 100k inhabitants 7 days) political, lots cross-border traffic. gone threshold already weeks ago. Keep mind lot efficacy studies/trials done symptomatic covid. 

So hear/see scary news stories Olympic members testing positive, remember massive testing going find lot asymptomatic covid. studies. link aggregate article since studies PDF. Study 1 shows Moderna produces antibodies Delta Beta, surprise since literally every vaccine shown thing.

Study 2 shows Moderna 72% efficacy Delta ONE DOSE. IIRC, Pfizer around 33% one dose AZ around 30%. every comparison we've seen, Moderna typically slightly edges Pfizer, never seen drastic drop efficacy Moderna compared Pfizer. Assuming Moderna Pfizer Ballpark blind guesswork. making assumption based two basically exact vaccine. 

I provided studies proof. Now, show single study shows Moderna performing wildly different, even worse all, Pfizer?

What‚Äôs old saying? ‚ÄúStatistics sometimes like bikinis: reveal lot, hide best parts.‚Äù solution false hate speech speech. 

Censorship merely convinces others ""the establishment"" want know ""the truth"". Question favor lockdowns: say surge subsides without lockdown happening?

This great experiment test efficacy lockdowns. vast majority US restrictions whatsoever implement any. believe lockdowns way stop COVID, would expect cases rise basically every single unvaccinated person gets COVID, right? Especially given contagious Delta is.

If surge goes normal life cycle we've seen surges go subsides weeks without even getting close infecting every unvaccinated person, though, strong reason accept null hypothesis conclude lockdowns much alter surges C'mon fat, gotta get thing. know thing.

Pfizer Moderna finish vaccine children he'll say there's still 0.001% people can't get medical condition. point say enough feeling extremely disappointed fair-and-square vaccinated high-schooler who's treated like elementary middle-schooler terms mask policy good thing?

Or put box mask bashers vaccine? And, hospital, patients suspected confirmed go? worked went regular units awaiting test results, usually least one shift (early pandemic) caregivers weren‚Äôt even given N95‚Äôs. That‚Äôs quit. 

Maybe fortunate work somewhere enforced best practices, us lucky. Hell, worked assisted living specifically instructed employees change gloves ‚Äúvisibly soiled‚Äù, routinely patients. quit job too. 

I think need accept facilities handled differently. Hope gets wish!  masks honestly annoying would better everyone got vaccine instead. 

I still wear mask strictly required I'd rather get breakthrough case COVID wear mask time. I'm fully vaccinated way. Vaccination makes much less likely spread. better suit would something like breach contract

This along lines considering. must admit also speculating recovery facilities, needing PT etc. going home. 

Thx considered response. Yep, wear mask inside, reserve spot, window time, get (with mask on). HIPAA regulates health data privacy regard specifically defined personally identifiable information. Even then, largely forcing business follow policies define themselves, must meet certain standards.

The thing HIPAA lot ignorant people kept repeating term making meant. mean theory need them, sure. We're much less risk catching also likely much less risk spreading it.

It‚Äôs true large insurers. insurers offer waivers (maybe many thought). majority rest ACA compliant still would limit pocket maximums reasonable amount (no higher like 3-4k typically). 5% insurers ACA compliant people would little coverage. Also, pocket maximums waivers don‚Äôt apply get treatment network. 


So guess Id change answer say majority people covered reasonable amount (and completely), possible others still fall cracks. Medicaid medicare operate differently too. mask mandate lifted school (which I'm sure happen anyway), I'm wearing one volition. I'm fully vaccinated, [the vaccines still effective Delta I? unvaccinated going continue ignore calls.

I know lot vaccinated people [rightly] going ignore call mask again, too. Lucky Yet Americans free vaccine won‚Äôt take . think world right hate us Side effects vary. think weirdest part knowing I'm sick, feeling sick makes sense. like bad hangover. 

First shot soreness arm went away day so. Second shot woke feeling sore, thought ""guess I'm good."" 18 hours shot, hit like truck. started feel like getting sick, hour later bed shivering. rested day, moving around 8 hours later. 

Now people wanna vaxxed vaxxed, take long. get shot, hold 15 minutes, go way. 

I like needles either. Look way let nurse thing. 

Number 1 perk got first allergy attack. year ago stressed smallest sneeze. Post vax, said ""crap, allergies bad season!"" Also seeing people worrying. saw friends last year numbers low stressed 16 days after. hug go near mom. worked outside tent ran air purifier. driving nuts. even think it. 

Truth told, sound dystopian, biggest perk think going difficult enjoy things‚Äîfrom mental sanctions private companies different countries standpoint. friend vaccine quickly 180 consulting doctor realizing that... ""hey, gonna hard travel see places i'm vaxxed""  paywall looked yeah. I'm saying people automatically shut something impossibility like ... that's entirely possible. Women necessarily making things dramatic whatever.

Covid-19 different effects men women. Men, example, end severe cases on. 

The difference men women hormonal, however endocrine system course yeah area interest within scientific community. 

That stated, anecdotal write women's claims reason whereas kinda like
... that's possible? be?

So point proven, anecdotal. point basically guy using incorrect terms thinking within box made argument absolutely correct. 

But lymph node issue proven known side effect vaccines years. Plenty mammograms came back bad results well. person unnecessary biopsy. 

I'm scientist, can't like yeah missed/early period related vaccine,.but possible wtf. People shut one time. Alternative title: covid patient Louisiana cant admit wrong. would argue enough photos videos, remember everyone wanted storm icus thought empty people god damn minds? saw lot video nyc first feel like radio silence. need videos testimonials PSAs , idk else think Georgia institute second mask mandate?

Also, easy high schools implement vaccine requirements, colleges doing? Probably monetization.

Like actual money shots. 

You get JJ? 200 bucks.

You get moderna pfizer? 100 per shot. 

Cash always useful. Bingo

There reason faux news 180 (besides fucker tarlson)

They losing base correct read it. clicked article got white screen shouldn‚Äôt assumed. 

That said state really whole uproar wasting shots prisoners. state. rates equal white community, vaccinated Hispanic community less Asians. narrative unvaccinated florida old dying republicans needs stop, frankly true. 65 done phenomenal job getting vaccinated florida. younger age brackets need get bandwagon (regardless political affiliation), younger groups laggards refusing vax think impact Real surgical masks tend layer electrostatic charge, N95s material filter well fit therefore actual filtration vary drastically. modified certain techniques improve fit therefore filtration way similar level N95.

Various governments Europe Asia allow cloth masks allow procedural/surgical masks reason. also consistent comes level protection cloth vary quite drastically starts 10%. 

I would link sources mods get me. Even though fine stating misleading info masks offensive stuff well.

A well fitting respirator generally way go decent personal protection plus directly indirectly reduce spread others.  anti-vaxx, deathly afraid needles.

I also afraid needles like held getting vaccine last month. still wore mask everywhere I'm fool (still wearing mask reason, honestly), hoped vaccine adoption would enough could treat COVID vaccine flu one: optional.

I've experiences last year though put ""fuck future, living today"" mood that's decided get vaccine. future uncertain, know long we'll left normal type stuff shit starts gettin' really real I'd rather worry long COVID whatever ""good"" time left. got second dose Monday.

The big thing though convinced everyone said syringe technology improved significantly since last time got vaccine (meningitis around 2011) true. first time got shot cry. bad all! real (as opposed lying shit people tell turns bad thought would LYING). would say par getting shot mouth they've tranqed jaw Oragel first. know happening, alarming all.

 holding reason, encourage it. liken old thing sex someone you‚Äôre sex everyone sex everyone sex on. vaccine condom example. know sure. discovering way yet mean way yet discovered. 1) never going reach 80% vaxed

2) virus circulating generation mutating entire time. People pushing ""they rolled back masks soon"" narrative need realize eliminating virus stopping mutations never achievable goal. CDC? Also that‚Äôs ‚Äúa preponderance epidemiologists, it‚Äôs preponderance responded survey (which also implicated asked take survey). Much media, population, business community federal politics never board seeing virus problem. Let vaccinated people live..lock unvaccinated people down. Let's goooooo. dont like either believe vaccines respect rights others to. position agree with, possible sympethic people example religious objections vaccines claim still wanting one yourself. 
A postion masks effective manded another example legitimate position. disagree see many holes choice think politicians manade side hold position. simple binary mask= true false Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Stating got 2 J&amp;J shots without explanation causes confusion (and rightfully so). fair, he's dead, got vaccine. He's probably pretty protected another variant comes along. make guy smarter, that's sure. people programmed would need complete reformat change thinking point. Isnt amazing think about? whole field science (which absolutely ignorant of) amazing.


Anti Vaxxers astonish regard. me, like handed recent top line computer going ""Nah, think Ill stick stones sticks thank much!* Ouch, brutal!  Probably similar. Antibody count Moderna even higher Pfizer delta. I‚Äôm high spread area wear mask. questioned say ‚ÄúI trust 98% effective vaccine don‚Äôt trust public‚Äù. area 38% vaccinated. Feel comfortable decision. chose denial way cope magnitude worldwide pandemic. Also SARS-COV-2 gaslighting everyone roulette way killing people. lot people, can't comprehend something never seen lives. America's previous mitigation efforts shielded seeing true toll Covid taking, imagine Covid denying American actually Peru, Italy, India, Mexico wave? Would cognitive dissonance stay intact?

""Old, sick-maybe live. Young-healthy-I'll think killing you.""-Covid  **Predicted Olympic Medals**

1. **Gold: Delta**
2. **Silver: Epsilon**
3. **Bronze: Zeta** Yeah, one huge main contributing factors Covid deaths  Honestly think narrative overblown. two choices: 

1) Announce masks longer required vaccinated.

2) Say even vaccinated individuals need continue wearing masks.

Both pros cons chose 1 honestly think right choice. even don't, acting like completely unjustifiable something they're ""crying"" ridiculous.

Going 2 would disincentivize individuals get vaccinated. also provided mixed messaging people *already* got vaccinated. Remember, still completely sure could still *get* COVID vaccine, still spread it, etc. fully support taking scientific stand saying ""this vaccine works. want protected, get vaccine"". 

There really middle ground could said ""we want people keep wearing masks acknowledge vaccine works"".

Furthermore, reality vaccine circulating mutating generation. lot people around seem willfully hoping wore masks another month, virus would stopped mutating seeing delta outbreaks. going outbreaks unvaccinated populations next 30 years. banning vaccine passports lmao. Okay.  guess people thing changes loose someone icu it‚Äôs late.

also significant number people living telegram-bubble. 

i‚Äôm scared happens bubble bursts.  know this. live Ontario. Mine issues needles need seek alternative methods seen information promoting option (I understand city news radio ads TV ads).  Thank information! I'll sure pass anyone may concerns. End result same. going find something wrong information comes vaccine regardless headline. Germany released recommendations this. J&amp;J would absolutely go get mRNA vaccine. (Not medical advice opinion!) agree. I'm surprised people making big deal it. question wasn‚Äôt specific US. People going suffer further, good number us dying. least get propagandized actually better countries without rolling disaster. thing happens gun violence privatized healthcare system. That's faulty comparison. Efficacy reduction outcome rate compared control group. Flu r0 1-2. Delta variant 5-8 much severe disease. loss efficacy much infectious severe disease ""great"" sense. Vaccinated populations experience worse outcomes before, entire pandemic worsen. magnitudes worse flu.  covid took Tylenol fever/headache, melatonin help combat sleep disruption, vitamin case. also give caffeine made heart race terrifying degree. get tetanus shot rug burn? something know about? decent rug burn weeks ago. healed course 1.5 weeks. never even considered going doctor let alone tetanus shot. have? 7500 miles seems little low side unless you‚Äôre driving race car experience texting. cool 95% across population. 95% across demographic. Vaccines work *with* immune system. immune system already weak, vaccine less. guy facebook said ""that cost freedom, willing pay"".

I could find words respond that! useless comparison. country ever went lockdowns regular flu. baseline flu vaccines pretty low bar beat, really tell us anything. comment multiple awards stickied top every discussion thread. talking US? highly regional thing here. several states mask mandates prevented legislature night clubs fully open last summer. Even serious states counties refuse implement mask mandates. vaccinated people likely wear masks LA, doubt city since can't even get unvaccinated people wear them. know many 5400 died? I'm curious death rate vaccinated individuals would be. Totally stupid they're combining hospitalizations death. mentioned plenty threads articles relevance topic discussion. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

A recent preliminary study actually suggests virus less likely mutate vaccinated people vs unvaccinated people (and course less risk vaccinated people getting infected well less risk vaccinated person infecting others). would course good continue tracking monitoring this, potentially good news one reason get many people vaccinated possible. think government really dropped ball area. recently read article US manufacturers started making N95 masks shutting due lack demand. covid related stimulus money, subsidising probably cost much.  minor inconvenience.

No, not. least many people, included. mask requirement might well return last year would rather stay home go try enjoy place mask on. think vaccinated people would mask wearing?

And right - big grey area constitutes actual infection someone tests positive since test find virus - vaccines obviously prevent someone exposing thus taking virus body. vaccine mandatory every country months, that's becouse single country afford economic damages coused future variants / hospital cure covid normal patients(so deperish cured) , stores restaurants closed etc. mandatory vaccine immigration stop way get out, new variants keep generating unvaccinated people. simple would say life pretty cheap China, still managed pandemic better US. countries better others recognizing threat pandemic economic, political, social stability. 95% 70% people vaccinated.

My point people putting people risk disproportionately poor, uneducated, color. People system failing decades. need understand attitudes toward them.

I get it‚Äôs frustrating. wish saw compassion outreach. vaccine experience brutal. hope protects well.  That's interesting. hope true, even though tragic. would say high schools, depends vaccination metrics locality. Since Georgia southern state high vaccine hesitancy, suppose blanket mask mandate *all* grades (i.e. AAP recommending) understandable. fact, even kind applaud Atlanta Public Schools running contrary mainstream southern expectation.

However, areas like Northeast vaccine uptake high, would *recommend* masks vaccinated high schoolers, still require unvaccinated students, including elementary middle grades. could wrong think Iowa stopped well.  Lockdowns Masks reason still people left infect. definitely drive numbers little.  Leadership must convinced harmless actively promote misinformation cult-like beliefs, could simply use lies conspiracies promote success popularity.

But turns that's true telling people vaccines came evil lizard people, believe die preventable infectious disease Especially harder state states low vaccination rates. agree ""2 Americas"" phrase needs freaking die. *What even mean?* dumb. news exception, vast majority wish received shot.

Reminder Trump, advisors vast majority GOP lawmakers vaccinated. Willing bet good money Mrs Greene too, dodges question. I'm curious people think masks moment. summer pretty unbearable wear IMO especially like 95 degrees humid outside. dislike wearing working gym. mind much winter personally dislike wearing masks. extra thing carry generally stuffy uncomfortable IMO. seems like lot /r/coronavirus readers endorsing mask wearing everywhere one thing like wearing mask TBH. 

I'd rather take breakthrough case COVID wearing mask. might minority took vaccine specifically avoid mask wearing. masked pandemic idea needing wear forever disconcerting IMO. He's apathetic towards vaccines best. obvious want piss certain someone's base. advocated them, signed laws make illegal schools businesses require vaccines. 

He also even reveal received vaccine questioned press. Compare high profile people made point receive doses camera. 

Surely see this? know large proportion unvaccinated people US ethnic minorities right? really saying 40% black people Latinos cancer? Sounds quite racist me! self confirming bias incredibly strong force emotion. us label ""common sense"" ""street smarts"" whatever else boy tough get someone outside that.  cancel afraid Covid, buddy. confirm. live MD far behind education vaccination rate. Seems tightly correlated. ""Taken over""? think strong basis culture US values, huge portion country see everything pro/con liberty pro/con economy. Like lens cannot judge things society human race, cannot make decisions one person make good everyone, like say plastic bags. fault, numbers, science showing anti-vaxxers going die higher rate need people vote dead can't vote, democrats vote dead (j/K last part) good argument restrictions? Florida lockdowns year STILL close herd immunity? studies whether mask mandates schools correlated better outcomes?

A lot places unmasked schools community transmission last year; could least look happened.

You tell tone I'm skeptical kids need masked schools (the masks use, way use them, simply good enough make difference) mostly I'm puzzled effect cloth/surgical masks little studied.  Naa guy fkn loogan. Here's problem brain-dead rube: He's going get hospital inform brain-dead rube friends family a.) bad; b.) die it; c.) better COVID get vaccine ""don't know anything about; d.) gubbermint going tell do.

And every single one brain-dead rube friends going believe go either get sick become disease vectors people. 

This shit cycle never ending pieces shit like guy. Also people double shot Pfizer NE states getting testing positive, way less severe cases pass lower viral loads unvaxxed people Alabama Florida. problem everywhere US now, SCARY problem low vax areas. Ah apologies assumed camp. Jumped conclusions.  evil, like Marjorie Taylor Greene refuses admit vaccinated. Would say clinically obese people? mounds documentation negative aspects obesity people ignored that. either stand dont . guess. kids grown live alone generally easier stand . love expressions come like "" accelerating timeline"" stop take breath analyze means - means know scared want work gulag give damn picking random early date start bullying individually coming back office. within 2 weeks receiving said dose, symptomatic July 3rd inoculation June 24th. incubation period 5 days average, got virus June 28th thereabouts. long enough immune system prepared first round antibodies vaccine.

If got virus week later likely story would've less interesting would've defeated faster. didn‚Äôt coin ‚Äú2 Americas‚Äù it‚Äôs recycled news lot lately.

My point people putting people risk disproportionately poor, uneducated, color. People system failing decades. need understand attitudes toward them. fully vaccinated. covid still rampant state, vaccination rates low. haven‚Äôt stopped wearing one. worried smallpox? interpretation polling constituents/viewers asking question like:

""If unvaccinated close relative friend died COVID, would make less likely vote Republican?""

And they're getting numbers really bad combine reality Republicans going lose someone close end thing.

So they're trying shift narrative get blamed discouraging vaccination over. sometimes depends ""effective"" means. One version heard meant ""against death serious disease"". still get it, die.  depends TYPE mask. Cloth masks help everyone around masked up, areas country that's happening. talking personal protection high-filtration N95 equivalents give level assurance. point, could compile book titled ""Fauci Says"". hope knows something FDA thinking. June 10th meeting make sound promising would recommend EUA vaccines 12 yo. Maybe stance changed light Delta and/or current case numbers. likely phrased poorly me. Tinder adding ""Im vaccinated"" stickers best thing help weed crazies deep red area. science, according Fauchi, say spread vaccinated person covid is. spread all, means kids get get it. think people want gamble kids health. science deltas effects kids still developing, 9% rate long term harm kids acceptable. Volitility though guy would wear mask cameras thought took mask right away absolutely right. details never communicated clearly public humble opinion.  Let's wait see says getting pikachu face.  changing? What's new guidance, plan forward? Please stop tip toeing around issue take action. call 2 Americas.

I would say unvaccinated prolonging tragedy, killing others unnecessarily taking position community impacts far beyond personal health. Internal polling rich donors indicating they're destroying base. Woah, what‚Äôs going Japan? would let person fever go building people said person one shot Moderna days prior?

When wife got PCR tested, treated like infected. 

Expect worst, hope best.

She negative, btw. Isolated result came back too.  know either BAD...or killing Republican voters worried. Get vaccinated, wear mask public try avoid large gatherings really do. vaccine, office 4 different people test positive virus several weeks/months apart. time everyone quarantined tested. 

We absolutely spread office people wore masks work. suggests population country trust government, matter effective vaccine is, people simply believe.  Maybe need auntie/uncle network people needle phobias someone hold hands distract jokes showtunes something subject get process easier? Constant loops big dogs playing gently kittens cute factor totally distracting? know, spit balling  88% effective symptomatic infection. infection. Important note like friends selfish people. Selfishness redeeming personality trait  advocate national mandate...? explained family's situation regarding masks. Thanks tip, unfortunately doesn‚Äôt seem want work me, least case. dont give fuck 1 percent, better protection, otherwise kids. I‚Äôm fine get again; didn‚Äôt know first time tested positive. vaccine pointless antibodies. daughter covid barely symptoms she‚Äôs probably going hospitalized reactions Janssen guess, right. Cases insane hospitals nightmarish still little restrictions Governor cares pissing contest politics. like last year. I‚Äôm kind interested see happens would prefer people would get vaccinated already. Jokes Fauci, never stopped wearing mine, even getting vaccinated!

For real though first winter take antibiotics steroids chest infection since lung surgery years ago. mask never leaving me. [Cognitive dissonance -  paying full medical bill, get free goverment Based what?

Fully vaccinated individuals still getting spreading virus (albeit lower rate)

Wearing mask certainly limits exposure. bullshit statement ""there vaccine hesitancy among vaccinated people.""

Um. No. If, point, July 2021 7 months vaccine became available, someone gotten vaccine ... vaccine hesitancy.

Unvaccinated people (who immunocompomised children 12) contributing ongoing spread duration crisis.

The partisan Atlantic constantly tries put gentle spin dumbass bullshit, tries make least little high brow. need quit shit. 

However, none surprising Mercer family owns Atlantic Trump supporting antivaxxers, shows. Florida leads nation averaging 8,107 new cases per day, 4,501 hospitalized per day, 38 per 100k +227% increase past 14 days. 

They seeing nightmare scenario 3rd wave unfolding front desperate put toothpaste back political tube. like also uses 'rugged individualism' them. 'Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.' - George Carlin   They'll forget lies.

The change merely practical one.

""it follows past whatever Party chooses make it. also follows though past alterable, never altered specific instance. recreated whatever shape needed moment, new version past, different past ever existed‚Ä¶.""

 - George Orwell, 1984  Can‚Äôt argue stupid   There‚Äôs clear correlation economics, education, vaccination. There‚Äôs even racial component, minorities significantly less likely vaccinated. It‚Äôs vulnerable people society, yet feel like many attacking people. Dude hit paywall hit refesh hit X appears time paywall pop-up wont load. first all, yes, part they're treated immunosuppressant drugs, effect whether take vaccine generally same. 


second all, asked fucking source. oh, look, one. 


here's CDC source, saying fine. fucking snarky Immunocompromised currently FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines live vaccines therefore safely administered immunocompromised people, including people HIV infection immunocompromising conditions people take immunosuppressive medications People autoimmune People autoimmune conditions eligible enrollment COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. imbalances observed occurrence symptoms consistent autoimmune conditions inflammatory disorders clinical trial participants received COVID-19 vaccine compared placebo. People autoimmune conditions may receive FDA-authorized COVID-19 Im crying masks... im sick tired government using Far-uvc lamps stop virus. weird.. realize it, also realize fault. mental gymnastics among conservatives hilarious. Take away drivers license no-fly they're selfish public threats  happens millions times every day, aware it. Even vaccinated see one cannot see possible inhale viral particles blow back onto others.  Someone sub put really well‚Ä¶ vaccine like raincoat, light drizzle don‚Äôt get wet, it‚Äôs pouring do. Vaccines don‚Äôt make us invincible didn‚Äôt anything. increasing cases increasing deaths lag. won‚Äôt increase much vaccines, definitely still go quite bit. still haven‚Äôt found effective antiviral (remdesivir isn‚Äôt either.) 66th time posted don‚Äôt need uneducated selfish asshole. Deal! Yep. starting hit leadership bad get time hitting followers, antivax party. mean fully vaccinated Pfizer vaccine, 70% chance getting Delta may get 70% less severe? words, clarify statement means exactly? First-hand accounts people went Covid, pleas medical staff takes care covid patients, first-hand accounts people suffering long covid, emotional stories people lost love ones. think effective. can't convince anti-vaxxer logic, emotion. also get masks people need reduce potential spreading others, well correlated who'd standouts anyway. thinking day anti-vaxxers going think reach nano technology repairs damage body? Delta appears behaving like mutation award *most likely infect highest numbers* perfectly honest, I'm afraid answer point is: Nothing. late. ship sailed. chance change opinions months ago. We're pretty much stuck course now, really anything change it.  
 
Well, almost. one person, one cult leader certain orange persuasion people listen to, follow unquestionly.  person suddenly come publicly, repeatedly loudly saying getting vaccination best thing world anyone ""worse lowly dog"", keep message consistently time, **that** would move needle. **only** listen him. Also, fantasy never happening, thought exercise.    effective masks primary-school classroom settings ? study weeks old compared recent one People chance, people made choices, herd needs get thinned. I‚Äôm vaccinated wear mask. Alabama. be. give shit kids womb. least make unvaccinated people must pay covid hospitalization costs pocket. really. positions pandering, leadership. expect leaders what's right societal health based science, waffle pander irrational, costly, disingenuous beliefs supposed beliefs.  I'm making valid point though. Learning origins covid help curb future outbreaks. particular, case accidental lab leak, stricter regulations need put place prevent that. watched HBO's Chernobyl? tried cover dismissing disaster one man's fault, done that, eventually thing could happen another nuclear plant. point is, causes worthy investigation others. death toll pandemic far overweighs plane crash taken much seriously. would flu deaths without vaccine? Covid vaccine also better. Everyone saying that‚Äôs great right effective flu vaccine. 50% remains FDA approved. continue hope vaccines produced bit better course, it‚Äôs still vaccine 50%.  don‚Äôt say . Funny conservatives concern troll Cuomo endlessly Republican states done much worse. Fucker probably helped kill thousands policies Russia one lowest vaccination rates developed world- tell you

Either doesn‚Äôt work anti-VAX propaganda spread planet came back bite population ass Stranger things known happen. That‚Äôs possibly never happening sadly, many anti-vaxxers US. Proof can't fix stupid.  understanding correct. think reference [to Probably not, part reason simply can't.

There literally tens millions citizens even known government. Plus, logistically difficult count millions (if true) death properly short amount time. cool story. Overflow treated covid units. need negative pressure rooms they're covid. That's happened heard. 

If one patient heart failure icu, unit. They'd different icu. 

It's like talking mule Well Delta Surge may last fall/winter... yeah cases start dropping August/Sept, they'll almost certainly go Oct/Nov. would it. final one. medical issues could use excuse don't. wear p100s work hours day. kn95s public around potentially vulnerable high risk people. happened real brave, strong sacrificial men woman country built by? Nothing cry babies anymore. problem they've everything handed without earn it. Trump medical team entered chat üòÇ  wonder states vaccinating people realize tourism hit going incur. Intelligent people want travel places positivity rates high. I‚Äôm Canadian. It‚Äôs vaccination, masks, etc. haven‚Äôt become politicized; it‚Äôs they‚Äôve become bit *less* politicized. Yes, that's much doubt findings. They're ones claiming vaccine somehow useless now, weirder still always politicians making claims public health officials. know what's going there, fact matter studies, real-world data captured daily support Israel saying. Maybe something, they're even transparent came conclusions. Unless countries start observing similar findings, would dismiss 64% figure outright. McConnell always pro-vaccine. Harris.  math seems reasonable me. Thanks response! Geez‚Ä¶ implies cares someone himself.  pushed signed law banning Florida schools requiring COVID-19 vaccine, forever.

Hundreds colleges across country already done this, can't Florida.

I know K-12 schools adding COVID-19 vaccine list required vaccines FDA full approval, happens, Florida schools able to.

This *way* outside norm vaccines schools (all states require vaccines schools, generally).

If that's (COVID) anti-vax, know is. also ask profound questions tho. ""How far want go tech?"" ""How ethical open gates widespread use tech?"".

Because, know... first time collectively ""forced"" accept artificially modified way. mean say conspiracy theory way, trust science theory, comes real applications... well, used nuclear power build (and use) atomic bombs RIGHT AWAY, even consider using energy production first. yeah, trust science, trust people use agenda.

I got vaxxed Pfizer, happy it, always part remain skeptical possible uses tech future. use part keeps whispering ""what abuse it?"". possibility, also unlikely.

Bioengineering absolutely amazing theory, happens build another atomic bomb something weapon itself? correct.

Antibodies stop getting infected first place. They‚Äôre also first line defense wane. don‚Äôt WANT antibodies every pathogen you‚Äôve ever encountered circulating times, would strain body say least.

So go encountering pathogen (SARS-cov-2 case), wane eventually fall non-existent near-non-existent levels (could take months, could take years, even longer, don‚Äôt know enough particular case yet every person also probably different). encounter virus meantime, they‚Äôll probably soar again. encounter virus they‚Äôve waned significantly, yes might get technically infected. memory cells recognize virus quickly time, pump antibodies fight it, also attack fronts (killer t-cells one).

I get wanting boost people, particularly high-risk folks, sky high antibodies never even contract virus. think makes sense given current conditions. eventually we‚Äôre going rely memory cells job. Well duh, deflect certain portion American population lose shit, demagogues seize &amp; propagate lies run win offices. makes sense  Agreed, studies I‚Äôm aware vaccinated masked. However masking prevent wearer spreading, even surgical (which wear surgery) even cloth masks.

Fauci mentioned vaccinated spread interview. bad thing actual science lags 2-4 months (which still breakneck speed) behind ground truth what‚Äôs happening today communities.

I‚Äôd interested see study likely vaccinated people transmit, haven‚Äôt found one. However naturally follows, Fauci points out, person processing virus (I.e. infected) able spread it. masks prevent spread, especially strain that‚Äôs twice transmissible, makes sense. 

That said. It‚Äôs annoying. Nobody likes it‚Äôs change feels like step back feels like never end. feel way. 

Something consider Israel vaccinated way herd immunity delta changed big way. Plus still millions people California vaccinated wearing mask unless it‚Äôs mandated bc hardly anybody checking vaccine cards. everybody wear mask, problem solved. far younger people, family friends dying enough either. even close.

It's going death influencers, plural, followed relentless, authentic TikToks Reels hospitalizations 'thoughts prayers' duets someone watching person dying ICU going get vaccine break echo chamber 'but young healthy' 'I think already it'. 

They need *see* *and hear* *someone like begging* *for vaccine* doctor telling late. actors. Actual people.  doctor mourning family afterward. Youth wasted young, assuming much changed, basically sociopaths age. need see someone like *dying needlessly understanding it* *as happens*.

Over over. wonder supporters say this. Deep State get him? Lol stop people even getting virus. Hey, awesome! I'm glad considering it. One daughters got Pfizer, partner daughter got Moderna.

1) side effects bad all, fatigued day two. daughter. sore arm annoying debilitating. 
2) got shots county hospital really fast. It'll depend go, really.
3) Yes, tip! Take deep breath right beforehand exhale like blowing big birthday cake. stick exhale hurts much less. ask warn right (very tiny) needle goes in. learned trick body piercer taught kids (young adults) still today really works.
4) tell perks, glad extra protection! one dose moderna. flu kills 2-600K people globally, per year. Global COVID deaths 3 million plus 2020. COVID vaccine effective flu vaccine would still mean 2 6 times death occur flu. you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre going hospitalized, you‚Äôre going IC unit, you‚Äôre going die,‚Äù

Not quoted story Biden also saying ""You're gonna get COVID unfortunate mis-statement obviously breakthrough infections occurring, even symptoms generally mild. quote already jumped antivaxxers we're going hear ""Biden lied!"" end time. Many us see family friends year. Gyms closed, go bars restaurants, seen concert year. postponed wedding lost thousands dollars. 

I know reddit attracts lot introverted people felt like past year half bad care concerts bars, I'm shocked many people downplaying sacrifices made. Yes, lockdowns full fledged ""don't leave house"" lockdowns, mental health effects damn near zero socialization social events can't offset afternoon park **a lot** people.  percentage one side plans getting vaccinated around 96%. side around 47%. might old people clearly proportional towards one side. That's theory, yeah.. Dude. can‚Äôt ‚ÄúBlabla‚Äù kids ICU. makes sound bad anti vaxxers. found it: imagine culpability knowing wrong something killing people still spreading millions people agenda known yourself. I'm looking you, Tucker. really tough situation. anyone dad, I'd cut off. allow anyone eligible vaccination declines see 3 year old son. Thankfully close relatives vaccinated hard choice make.

I think advice talk medical professional trusts good. wondering day 65+ people getting vaccinated (in USA) are. wife said read article lot coming vaccine hesitant people convinced primary care providers. Sad true. Fauci ""might want consider"" telling truth people pay wages stop calling Senators liars. damn well knew would come policies, stopped reporting daily covid cases, hospitalizations deaths. also went hard Rebekah Jones, whistle blower revealed Desantis wanted manipulate numbers. Bet latest reported numbers fudged well, way worse what's reported. wear right mask homemade catch flu. Well can't fix stupid, breeds like rats. Come killer comets!  Something like 99% cases deaths amongst unvaccinated. quick google search get valid sources. anti-vaxx, deathly afraid needles. Generally, avoid flu shots minor vaccinations needles stress out.

They nasal spray flu shot too. ask it. Sometimes order one takes days get there.

And also anyone afraid needles, literally could feel covid shot needle either time. legitimately worried like...missed arm felt better arm sore next day. true, cannot reasoned and, even faced reality, claim otherwise.
For few, doubt anything change minds. must sad life. almost keep collecting data adjusting results based new information. people vaccines forced finished children.

Aside hpv shingles isn‚Äôt anything normal citizen get aren‚Äôt already inoculated against.

I also suspect point desperate mixing miracle cures. I‚Äôm sure kind hospital work in, ones worked handful rooms built negative pressure rooms. units didn‚Äôt any, ICUs 2-4. COVID it‚Äôs peak, people certainly weren‚Äôt turned away (as suggested), rooms full. agree that's best solution. think realized shit going get BAD delta. Like, completely dumb, come restrictions, lockdowns, effectively vaccines. stuck super low vaccinations, variant that's going tear place. point going hard hide deaths. It‚Äôs awesome information keeps changing pandemic. /s    know COVID-19 new don‚Äôt answers yet  Wah Yeah, almost got taken flu (that went mycobacterium pneumonia + complications) 17. 

It‚Äôs years, still get flu shot every fall issues following health guidelines some. 

Lungs whole ‚Äúbreathing‚Äù thing sticks you. might get wish. Delta said deadlier. damn thing mutating still Anti vax people dying voters. Simple Nobody asking sympathy Israeli news reported 39% infected 91% serious illness. changed pretty fast.  Well goes chances RNC. *never* going zero COVID. want sound like doomsday sayer here, there's always going least one person given moment, unless vaccine literally 100% effective. even vaccine, literally everyone would take it. 

I'm 19, one things aware fact that, well, might lives now. mean, happened many times history. We're never going go back 9/11, especially airports. might another watershed moment world history. Maybe many years scars dealt upon world eventually heal, meantime...  news. probably survive, still 1 3 chance (roughly) Long Covid. 

I flat think society's generally soft luxurious existence (compared human history) absolutely destroyed human ability assess risk properly. got sent home college day goodbye everyone knew. last time saw lover since disappeared life lockdown exhaustion. lost contact withe everyone left without support net. Everyday boring drag. wake up, work, go bed tiny bedroom. stuck inside perpetually bored I'm active person like explore. immense boredom made OCD worse almost led suicidal thoughts. 

This I'm exhausted.  Unfortunately, believe late. They've integrated identity. ego-death save them, think they'd actually die first. `It‚Äôs suggested wear mask indoors situation level dynamics virus community that‚Äôs high` 

Dynamics virus? perfect example messaging past 18 months lacking. vague esoteric message practically useless. authority matter, commit blanket recommendation one way other. ok overly reductive communicating guidance masses. That‚Äôs called bullying 

At point assume virus let sheer overwhelming incompetence China Dead people don‚Äôt vote recently got Moderna covid back June 2020. redness, soreness, itching arm really bad headache lasted couple hours. person vaccinated told covid usually react worse first shot unlike covid reacting second shot. Headache arm soreness side effects. vaccine, 

You'd probably dead. know that's true, nothing wrong mentioning loud. remind people deaths going following cases. We're losing bit 2000 people week low point. number could 200 trending down, it'll trending shortly instead.   think time current government stop pretending previous government trying push antivax agenda. time make vaccines mandatory ban type antivax propaganda. way put stop pandemic. Also vaccinated people given certificate required attend public place air /sea traveling. Almost none reported kids Yeah thought would get away riding anti vaccine wave. sane part country getting vaccinated = GOP reap benefits people‚Äôs sacrifice without contributing.

Looked like going get away spring. Cases going moderate vaccine rates.

Now see delta variant pushing need vaccinations way higher. cake eating anymore.

If don‚Äôt get base vaccinated either die need rounds shutdowns bad business. Israel 64% vs infection. 88% efficacy vs symptomatic infection. Two different things measuring. true  ones thought trust anti vax keep masks on. Complete dumbasses. That‚Äôs pivotal point was. think need offer money compensation exchange vaccine. believe paying people $200 get shot would enough convince large portion people get it. China says can't get country, can't conduct investigation China Chinese government want to. refuse give visas arrest anyway.  gross. one jeopardize customer's welfare beliefs?! 

I sure know carnage could cause population, even community vaccinated. 70% hospitalizations deaths breakout cases part 65+ age group. 

For people show compassion care one emotionally-challenging jobs, really difficult fathom vaccination rates low. I'm glad one accurate maps (looking you, CNN) portray VT big surge. cases technically increased, increase 5 day 10 really count surge. Cases low blip data looks way important is. Keep rocking it, fellow Vermonters!!!  post nasal drip sign Covid? Ive vaccinated since May moderna shot, Ive lot post nasal drip lately curious. 

Also, I‚Äôm trying concerned breakthrough infections I‚Äôve started reading breakthrough infections Reddit it‚Äôs starting freak  ban website? government suing private institution private practice exactly?

You hypocrites terrifying. true. Though necessarily ***vocally*** pro-vaccine. guess little bit, recently. He's taken covid seriously want die it, though. I‚Äôll delete response. appear saying vaccine you. sure would allowed Affordable insurance act. like pre-existing condition? Short publicly beating shit anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers?

Make dissemination fraudulent information social media crime. Growing South, Klan (or whatever dipshit name identify now) would hand flyers town; became illegal, stopped. it‚Äôs internet people think it‚Äôs real needs stop. Maybe, $250 would motivate enough. it‚Äôs linked outline :) Probably risk group. get this, hope named MANY MANY wrongful death lawsuits.    jab. job wish legal/ethical deny people healthcare put harms way like this. pay healthcare full rather tax payers/insurance payers to. Wonder insurance companies require get vaccinated cover charge extra vaccinated.  Biden Trump (and others) stage giving message people get vaccinated.

The leadership parties agree vaccines good us, say together time. outlying crazy voices scaring people get say ""It's side wants take drugs."" 

Break unified message.

Make party musicians performances. Celebrate vaccine properly.

It'll never happen think would break last pockets resistance. think Fox news going say Trump wrong, vaccine still bad? lost year half life, I‚Äôm back normal too. Stop moving goalposts move on. dense? supporting compulsatory vaccinations doesn‚Äôt make anti-vaccine. Reddit authoritarians terrifying. forgetting accompanied image invokes subconscious prejudice Fair point. I'll swear moral question. willing accept might spread disease unvaccinated person might die? certainly am. chance protect themselves; get sick point them. virtually everyone get vaccinated going end getting sick point anyway, matter many masks wear.

Other people disagree moral framework free wear masks mitigate risk. Cities may require masks certain settings help mitigate healthcare burden, comply regardless beliefs. wear want to. also lots people got sick Covid, mild case, vaccinate ""they're already immune"" aunt almost died (coma 30 days) daughter son law refuse get vaccine. said able survive get it. 

People really worst enemy‚Ä¶  Agreed. There's sudden epiphany awakening conscience. GOP's big data scientists running statistical models concluding voter base (or be) shrinking result vaccinating.

They used believe siding anti-vaxxers would result votes. believe promoting vaccinations result votes, they're promoting vaccinations. big data indicates promoting diet heavy rat poison would result votes, they'll start promoting rat poison heavy diets hopes securing votes.

*Edit: politician something, believe will, ultimately, result votes.* ""I know anyone, besides you, virus."" - Dad

I think hit nail head. know anyone got virus, beside me, 200 miles away, see threat happy take chances. Taking shot, even minuscule chance something going wrong, deliberate choice expose it. Maybe given green light basically everyone take masks off.  trust science? went Gulf Shores, Alabama NOBODY Alabama wearing mask even attempting social distance. People often bubble, shields cash registers. like covid radar whatsoever. bizarre. notice risk losing supporting voters. Nothing bet, give shit anyone lol agree stats overall conclusions, probably due different priorities. 

From last summer, haven‚Äôt really worried getting sick Covid. I‚Äôm 33, perfect bloodwork, perfect blood pressure, non-smoker, significant allergies (although allergic latex, get rash sustained exposure), autoimmune conditions (even something like mild eczema) healthy weight (asterisk gained 15 lbs last year I‚Äôm threshold overweight BMI). 

Prior vaccine weight gain, probably outcome Covid infection unpleasant cold-like illness. (And WFH plenty PTO, financial risk either.) true boyfriend well. locked hard due moral concerns transmitting Covid someone would harmed. 

Our concern always participating transmission chain killed anyone line. Basically trying prevent death someone 10 links chain, whose death would never know about. 

All efforts sacrifices hypothetical people health risks. lockdown worse impact physical mental health probable Covid outcome. right thing do. 

So, perspective, 12% transmission risk post-vaccination still significant moral framework. slowly eased household restrictions mid-June, really relaxed behavior. 

The reason waited mid-June give everyone US time get vaccinated. Vaccinations became widely available without appointment early May throughout US. didn‚Äôt refresh drive hours anymore. could walk random CVS get jabbed. 

At point, _vast_ majority US residents harmed Covid-19 chosen outcome getting vaccinated. moral responsibly domestic unvaxxed basically zero, don‚Äôt care. still believe precautions prevent international spread ‚Äî isolate get tested flying, avoid participating international transmission chain. 

That aside, think many older vulnerable people at-risk moderate significant illness don‚Äôt realize it. boyfriend‚Äôs dad 78 previous heart attack. longer taking precautions got vaccinated (with J&amp;J). bad flu would enough harm health‚Ä¶ think he‚Äôs overestimating protection vaccine.  taken US culture

So wanted adjust ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù 60% vaccine efficacy infection assume everybody infected transmits efficiently (which know almost certainly true), would 16% benefit? right? suck math.

So conclude it‚Äôs somewhere 4 16% added benefit? Good. Keep focus vaccines masks. Vaccinated people wearing mask threat. Oh boy, go again.   So? much, Thursday usually weekly peak. according reuters, Russia even enough vaccines people. guess Russian Government competing US show World real ""savior"" sure this. far know Sputnik V vaccine works pretty well, studies San Marino Argentina proved, Russian can't produce lot vaccines, anyway countries include Argentina starting produce russian vaccine. TN, governor literally paying tourists come $250 vouchers, we‚Äôre fifth worst state vaccination rate. ""Don't shove throat"" pretty bold statement someone probably breathing tube shoved soon enough.  God forbid children‚Äôs parents actually taught decent human beings instead relying educators literally everything Trump actually endorse vaccine months ago. staff pulmonologist (lung disease doc) doesn‚Äôt mask. They‚Äôre supposedly vaccinated. actively discourage patients masking exam room, even breathing tests done. 

They also advertise symptomatic people come testing. IN, office, drive-thru test parking lot &amp; wait outside results. separate waiting room, it‚Äôs ventilation system. 

Gotta hook long-term customers early get $$$.  post governor florida, political? Good work overcoming fear needles coronavirus vaccine! Vaccine companies start conducting trials boosters target variants specifically. vaccines 100% effective? Good.

No special treatment morons get shots. iMHO important rub in.

Let narrative Trump funded development personally waited clear evidence see past situation clouded next administration's bumbled rollout.

Let conclusion smart time getting shot.

All care get it.

We fight political battles domain politics, worry keeping score public health. Israel claimed recently afternoon vaccines offer 41% protection symptomatic infection. seems far low, appear fit real world data. Yeah everyone gets it, delta running like wildfire no. I'm vaccinated done masks lockdowns. Ah, good luck there, hope visit Canada sometime soon (maybe even next month). gotta make sure things alright. everything last year, honestly expecting someone importance die maybe make real people, never seemed happen I'm expecting now. think right though. wot? They'll find another excuse even FSA gives full approval. Viet Nam also producing Sputnik V Russia. Everyday Israel seems lowering reported efficacy, rarely find reports. tv Israel what?

Still waiting actual studies reports it‚Äôs 64% 2 weeks ago. again, US regional. going many places maybe even can't implement mask mandate. state one them. might already know amount people encounter would surprise you. Obviously low quality masks thin material going work. say few/little studies cloth masks surgical masks foolish ignorant. follow CDC guidelines masks school, simple that. tell surgical

Why surgeons use surgery ""hard tell?"" hoping could spill tea market went money men told party cut shit. it‚Äôs basically worthless. Whole point getting vaccine able finally stop wearing masks socially distancing. don‚Äôt see polio vaccine saying, ‚Äúmay reduce chances death/paralysis you‚Äôll still get sick‚Äù 

Plus it‚Äôll still mutate get it, vaccinated ‚ÄúAnother pivotal point‚Äù, yet come brush boosters drop mask mandate early blowing face. delta deadly towards younger people? vaccine ages hospitalized, nonstop ‚Äúyounger people‚Äù majority 50+ vaccinated therefore that‚Äôs left younger? delta like Spanish flu second time around wrecks younger demographic? It‚Äôs hard tell.  got operation, gave something made relaxed fell asleep. put under, still conscious, sleepy completely able disregard going on. 

Also, long-lasting get groggy. Maybe milder version that. 88% among efficacious vaccines ever developed. seriously good enough you?  perfect still encouraging. Thank  would mandate point. know young, healthy people see threat them‚Äîonly things like needing vaccine travel work matter. circle, try appeal people's emotions surrounding ignorance vaccine go there. One friend said he'll get wife trip. played leader/man card invoked FOMO trip. He's considering getting shots soon even wife doesn't. wife already COVID hosting get-together thankfully said to. Another concerned side effects, fast vaccine developed thinks body handle anything(except vaccine, guess). He's pretty stubborn logical. told story facts figures going change anyone's mind already came conclusion. shared facts figures everything he's saying wrong, hoping let guard hearing informed people subject. thought articles shared insightful made narrow list vaccines would consider get clicking in-article links broke options down.

I think either get shots. We'll see. made point hear out, get objections, shared info let figure they're wrong left that. appeal things matter people emotionally.  don‚Äôt wish disease, suffering, misery, death anyone.

But, keep sympathy empathy non-covid cases turned away hospitals due unvaccinated filling up, suffering hospital staff, cant get vaccinated, due medical conditions, live terror unvaccinated. Virginia statistics let filter date range. Still seems vastly unvaccinated Lockdowns politics. I'm vaccinated i'm willing locked again. plan go first large sporting event since covid started. Im vaccinated mother not. mainly stays home mostly. chances give attend large outdoor sporting event? auto immune conditions preventing vaccination? 

congrats asshole. nowhere claim auto immune conditions prevent vaccinations... needed something lash at. great day thats possible. Oh man, masks godsend hayfever / allergies. Crazy think many particles pollen inhale nose past 2 years.  ""Doesn't help"" code ""Don't bother"". People informed; FWIW that's one part puzzle.   know details... probably need registered public healthcare system able call vaccination...

If know exist... call you...

I suppose 1 3 chance long covid catch covid. One third HOSPITALIZED patients get long covid, fraction covid cases hospitalized. I'm wondering improve vaccination rates.

I think way reward people got vaccinated punish people didn't. could give everyone gotten vaccinated money, higher amount, better work, make vaccinated mandatory certain places.  Yeah-whatever kid. It‚Äôs ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù entire point getting vaccine get infected all. 

‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs fine you‚Äôll little sick‚Äù oh mean I‚Äôll still infected virus that‚Äôs causing blood clots long term effects? I‚Äôll still take unpaid time work? man live reality do. might well another planet. 

Also, curious insurance company think statements need re-hospitalized (even total moron, hope happen.)  True, population under-vaccinated would fair raise rates. Well...fair might huge overstatement comes insurance. None fair. perspective different since Canadian.

Using location however would kind defeat purpose, since affect specifically non-vaccinated. remember USA euthanize pigs. Wish could shipped overseas instead tend agree you. It‚Äôs definitely controversial opinion, small bit comfort take capitalism‚Äôs mirroring ‚Äúsurvival fittest‚Äù. less negative decisions affect rest- better. Unfortunately, even fictional scenario individual like man saddled entire cost himself, likely inability repay charges well limited resources hospitals physical, mental emotional tax healthcare workers cannot avoided. 

Not get philosophical here, solid argument made protection ‚Äúconsequence absorption‚Äù made society cases like increases likelihood people like man live adulthood propagate- thereby steadily increasing negative impact people like given society. we‚Äôve neared point percentage idiots surpasses 50% threshold begin dictate democratic direction entire populace? already? 

I work healthcare love helping people. nothing disappointing jading see effort immediately wadded dunked nearest waste bin. Covid exhausting surge we‚Äôre seeing burden neither strength (and soon, desire) bare. Hospitals hemorrhaging staff months expected fewer eventually break even resilient us.

Except whole ‚ÄúIn presence large number hosts, viruses mutate get efficient infecting them.‚Äù

Delta fourth identified variant. vaccines tested, part, wild virus, alpha. also know raw data matched age cohort. Raw data going make efficacy vaccines look much worse, comparing older sicker vaccinated population younger healthier unvaccinated population. Matched age major, want know well 70 year old vaccinated people 30 year old unvaccinated. want know well they're 70 year olds unvaccinated. I'm afraid needles, seriously barely feel it.

That help people phobias (rather simple aversion needles). usually pain feeling all. even seeing it; knowledge usually enough trigger phobia.

I've got friend phobia needles strong enough close actually interfering life times. way describes too, nothing pain.

For specifically, something thought needle piercing body. point matter see feel it; simply knowing happen makes completely lock up. Afterwards he's completely fine, lead-up describes horrible.

He's got first dose recently though despite phobia. feel pain here. son young receive well family members refuse wear it. Really shitty situation. I'm thankful I'm part country little activity, can't help worry it'll make way eventually. what.  May ask experience like sick covid vaccinated? feel like mono? anything compare to?

I‚Äôm vaccinated Moderna sister Pfizer. What? absolutely true. studies conducted population cannot consent (children, prison inmates, mental disability) must go much rigorous approval process. Ethics committees get involved, institutional review boards. Saying definitely inaccurate. Education everyone meant prevent problems like this. Except exceptional American education system failed exceptionally find people outright denies medical science popping every part country. Excess death studies statisticians proven covid death totals likely underreported US Gotta love ""freedom"". 
We also take time applaud Amercan educational system. haven‚Äôt able watch loved ones die like diseases. years ago watched father die cancer, spent last two weeks hospital, every day. held hand breathed last breath.

I‚Äôll never forget that, it‚Äôs still traumatizing.

My grandmother died Covid, one allowed bedside. intubated weeks, one saw it. still feels like it‚Äôs real. information standpoint, nothing. third country convinced, due misinformation, government wants disable shot.

It's going come corporations putting mandates like hospital networks presently. There's legitimate personal reason getting shots, refusing get shots walking crowd people tantamount turning biological weapon.

Seems like new variant becoming resilient... really hope people wise up, get vaccinated, catch stop producing new variants every months. frustrating trying keep families safe random assholes think know better scientists doctors come make things much harder... Exactly, im going put life hold bunch people scared getting virus. willing originally vaccine real health risk, reasonable reason forced wear masks. See, always think economic system unbeatable conglomerate wealthy individuals. realize can‚Äôt even predict something simple (or GME another recent example).  do, you‚Äôve already decided wearing mask ruins school year that‚Äôs you. school obligation protect children serve, majority minors. low vaccination rates amount teenagers, still need masking high schools general. High school isn‚Äôt college. Thanks - I‚Äôve trying find data, luck. friends refusing Vax they‚Äôve already Covid. isn‚Äôt nearly bad haven‚Äôt refuse get vaxxed, I‚Äôm still urging get least one shot. Seriously, fuck chode. He‚Äôs disaster world cannot afford tolerate. Yesterday's news article used weird, hard decipher terminology - percent **reduction** efficacy. pointed terminology could interpreted two different ways got downvoted. probably data! need rent contribution, use incentive get vaccinated? in, ‚ÄúI want stay help financially, making sacrifices living here. least could get vaccine little peace mind freedom living you.‚Äù could tie ultimatum, always chance backfiring you‚Äôre truly willing move out.  point right here, conversations people still received shot claiming ""they want see works"". statistics seems pretty evident point. Wow, sub like two subs time.  Imagine dying last rational thought mind turns mush gotten vaccine. Tragic Cash money. 50 bucks free weed. Enough money make difference people's lives. 

Here California, *billions billions* surplus. could easily afford pay every vaccinated Californian (no matter got shot) 1000 bucks enter lottery 1,000,000 still money could spend. 

I know ""rewarding"" vaccine hesitant people brings uncomfortable negative feelings many fellow pro-vaxxers, would hope could push emotions aside agree know effective. Incentives work. better incentive, people take advantage it. 

1000 bucks life- changing money many (most?) Californians. would likely save us money long run, importantly, would get shots arms. email CDC let know spreading misinformation 1. side effects minimal. went work shots sort paced myself. worst felt little 'blah' end day happy get home chill couch. Arm soreness worse feeling like someone punched arm grade school. YMMV
2. location 30 minutes included 15 minute wait time could make sure immediate adverse reactions
3. look direction. find watch much easier.
4. Relief. right community. got free tshirt work wear Fridays instead normal work gear :) Heck hospital even family members get angry/confrontational nurses intensivists save relative give right meds fix Covid. Even removed security police called. country from? Define SK level risk. we're talking deaths, yes, East Asian countries, SEA well, US beat terms death risk. terms cases? think enough people psychologically ready handle idea COVID still going circulating level 500-200 cases day state, even low hospitalizations deaths.

But also would need factor proportions percentages based population rates I'm smart enough math. live Florida I'm alright cases hovering around 600-1000 statewide. UK experiencing much different summer compared last year, US also saw large summer spike south last year similar we're seeing now. still think infection patterns clearly result several factors including seasonality, immunity, mitigation efforts, etc I‚Äôm hard time keeping up. last checked, CDC explicit saying safe indoors unmasked, even unvaccinated folks.

The messaging keeps changing vaccine still free. got J&amp;J first quickest get age-group became available. area started allowing walk-ins went got RNA shot. basically enough people infect anymore? Social end =/= epidemiological end

In many places social end already here, actually. pay pocket, please. I've many patients able hold somewhat conversation (with O2 therapy assist usually) intubated. think reasonable patient could ability make simple request like prior sedated intubated. Desantis McConnell generally pretty reasonable data driven. They‚Äôre allied crazies. Make people think COVID, great prank seems like charming human I'm saying need forget Gelgameks second.. Oh god no!  present cold, people confuse symptoms cold flu point. People think need gastrointestinal issues flu, that's atypical adults. Sore throat, fever, body aches, cough probably flu, runny nose, cough, congestion, slight fever, sore throat (or irritated coughing) cold. Moderna? people still listen guy...? Biden make secret agreement GOP switch standing vaccines. soon happens, antivaxxers change standing rush get jab. I'm feeling really owned right now. even bother check who's hospitalized dying COVID now? Hint: vast majority vaccinated.  They‚Äôre dishonest. Full vaccine approval takes years. Masks protect protect others. can't vaccinated immune system weak, need people wear masks vaccinated. One biggest concerns hospitalized. afford even short hospital stay. Another concern possibility placed rehab/nursing home. ones seen horrible. Yet,, I'm sure family take care needed lots care. Lastly, work.  That‚Äôs better. didn‚Äôt even know coronavirus jails existed fucking hypocrite Shit, sorry hear that. 
I expecting back office September, although see Delta derailing plan. 
I‚Äôm thrilled kids going person school high wave. 
I need weigh options‚Ä¶   school doesn‚Äôt process procedure addressing bullying huge problem needs priority. it‚Äôs masks, something else: race, gender, religion, disability, etc.

If bullying isn‚Äôt addressed allowed run rampant consequences unsafe environment kids can‚Äôt learn, there‚Äôs really point trying teach anything else get control. 

As how, every school something place, system tracking addressing behavioral issues. digital reporting system, school counselors, ongoing training classroom management program designed build sense community. We‚Äôre perfect, bullying happens sure shit don‚Äôt ignore it. demographic problem years, projected get worse. 

Up embracing rhetoric literally leading hundreds constituents dying every day. 

No amount voting law desecration going help people dead. That‚Äôs thing though doesn‚Äôt matter CDC guidance is. people going comply, groups largely didn‚Äôt before. Imagine everyone felt way. We're hospital! i'm sure thought one way friend understand vaccine long-term effects literally impossible, right?   way get shots arms get herd immunity. continue put individual rights freedoms else public health situation, go ship. I've experience. county 30% seen mask besides months. People stare typically stay away, I've even confronted wearing one.  actual data 39% efficacy infection? I‚Äôve seen numerous times today, including here, still haven‚Äôt seen data study showing it. fact, I‚Äôm still waiting something official 64% claim 2 weeks ago! happening primarily states expand Medicaid cover people. 

That's hilarious (in ""laughing otherwise cry"" way). Missouri voters actually voted expand Medicaid, state government decided enact decision. Missouri one leading hot spots. Also, outbreak causes game played, NEITHER team gets paid game. NFL really cracking this, love Seatbelts actually major impact insurance coverage. 
Insurance may charge smoker. insurance purchased may treat obvious result differently, knew smoked entered contract you. Lying insurance provider smoking may result loss coverage liability damages insurer defrauded. strong response second Pfizer jab (terrible muscle aches, fever, chills) got symptomatic COVID. symptoms similar, symptoms actual COVID (coughing, sore throat, sneezing, runny nose). vaccine symptoms lasted day worst COVID lasted 4 days, though. work way since rely technology.

It similar. President Biden claiming get infected sick vaccinated blown proportion.  LA county brought back mask mandate. sure else Forty- nine many millions? I'll take odds. thing think need really understand many kids 12 have. mean number got pretty large since gotta replace us point right?

Maybe 1/6th total world population? really number 1 comment. It‚Äôs abhorrent broadcast. absolutely people see choose vaccinated it. CBS ashamed putting world many people see ‚Äúnews‚Äù organizations social media outlets pick . Way go assholes. Let's hope stick landing. numbers don‚Äôt support though, maybe quite 90% placebo, that‚Äôs exaggeration degree part based numbers they‚Äôre probably like 30%-40% effective less contagious variants floating around. it‚Äôs actually viral load setting infections they‚Äôre probably gonna virtually useless delta probably 10%-15%.  personally vaccinated 150 people two day span Pfizer vaccine. two days, anaphylactic reactions (serious, life threatening allergic reactions would expect 20min vaccine), common immediate side effect sore arm. 

Most people get sore arm. people display flu-like symptoms (body sore, fever, fatigue), recover within 48hr onset symptoms. flu-like symptoms COVID, basically body's way showing there's immune response vaccine, job essentially. 

I recommended Pfizer Moderna family members. Mother fully vaccinated well Grandma brother recommended it. would recommend believe myself. also fully vaccinated husband. benefits far outweigh risks us. 

Whatever available area, Pfizer Moderna, make appointment get first dose. Overcome fear first time easier go second dose.  Florida averaging 8100 new cases per day 4500 hospitalizations per day +95% increase 14 days ago. remember seeing post back literally put people MRI gave information conflicted deeply held belief literally could see brain shuttling blood flow away critical thinking part brain. resist urge confirm biases resist nature itself. think certainly start rolling new vaccines target delta variant. main variant all. could bump effectiveness back 95%.

It like sharpening pencil. üôÇ  Seriously? Enjoy getting dragged security police case.   winning strategy know fact forced them. Also France done worked amazingly get vax rates up. Antivaxer concern trolls like usually flippant morals toss trash theyre told cant go bars, coffee shops, music venues, etc theyre vaxd.

Employers want pay sick time worker idiot got sick died vaxed.

The military want troops dying need bodies.

Health insurance companies want pay people catching preventable illnesses negligent actions.

Healthcare facilities want patients getting sick.

Music venues want bad press outbreak.

Will universal mandate? No. life become progressively harder live without vaccine days past approval go on? Absofuckinglutely live capitalist society who's main goal protect profit. lucked currently protecting profit also means protecting people pandemic. 

Very soon approval vaccine pushes start going incentives requirements many places. I'd willing put money multiple mandates multiple industries ready made official press button. lawyers probably reviewing shit months. gathered group medical professionals week long meeting discuss current options , recommendation get fucking vaccine Frankly, neither pandemics threaten people like COVID does. live 75+ year old grandparents. stopped wearing mask, even though I've fully vaccinated since March. people seen neighbors deaths horrible deaths maybe would taken seriously. Show one clip covid ICU US. Yogi Bear attacks people steals picnic baskets  gets bill hospital stay, absolute moron guy. myth dealing David Martin:
‚ÄúThis vaccine. mRNA packaged fat envelope delivered cell. medical device designed stimulate human cell becoming pathogen creator.‚Äù, Martin getting injected chemical substance induce illness, induce immuno-transmissive response, words nothing going stop transmitting anything. getting sick cells thing gets sick.‚Äù


There‚Äôs nothing even say. It‚Äôs exhausting. Anyway, I‚Äôm vaccinated. Fyi people BC getting text book 2nd shot exactly 7 weeks first dose, like clockwork

Source: co-workers VCH problem we're allowed talk who's avoiding vaccines without called racist

so instead blame White Republicans exact opposite Biden needs talk insurance companies cover covid expenses unless prove allergy vaccine component immune compromised grateful Canada's federal government, Ontario's provincial government local PHU providing two doses Pfizer wife I. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true lol. African Americans vaccinated lower rate White people vast majority democrats. Also younger people vaccinated way lower rates older people I‚Äôm sure lot young people Democrats. 65+ main demographic Republicans 87% vaccinated   you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre going hospitalized, you‚Äôre going IC unit, you‚Äôre going die,‚Äù Biden said forum Mount St. Joseph University.

Is someone going correct misinformation? hear big issue now.  Lol killing lots republican voters drank kool aid vaccine bad. republicans fine virus majorly affecting people ""democrat run big cities"".   Hot damn, awesome. could somehow apply regular jobs ok cost? talking lives man. Like real people families jobs friends. ffs  would like see efficacy age group medical conditions. underestimating efficacy vaccinations, group that's likely hospitalized (elderly) also likely vaccinated. 

Theoretically, vaccinated people death's door, calculated way person did, results would indicate vaccine increased likelihood hospitalized 

Since UK vaccinated rate varied based age group, something can't ignore them.  surprised. go outside one wearing mask. wear mask people stare like idiot Sorry wrong. way show horror ICUs pandemic would get consent patients. can‚Äôt imagine reasonable way it. accident films nature foreign countries. Yes exactly.

There many variables otherwise. Ie. 99% June equal 99% September.  control group allows compare apples apples.

Efficacy tells protected compared someone vaccinated. effectiveness probably something fairly static. human, virus variant, vaccine. OK, something that's realistic United States. disagree this, politically happen.  Masking may prevent lockdowns, pretty short-sighted.  Oh works too. YouTube private platform, free speech guarantee place. policies violate get banned, anti-vaxxer would get sub. people stupid genes quite amusing see reactions masks vaccinated. I'm vaccinated recognize importance continuing minimize transmission global pandemic over. I'm glad there's masks mandates city despite vaccination rates numbers continue fall feel safer public. think right refusing vaccines blend vaccinated crowd without restrictions. meantime, least people wear mask necessary. pretty sure submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 39% effective, wouldn‚Äôt cases EXPLODING given current mobility population? Like yeah cases going up, it‚Äôs nowhere near close past surges were? Israel‚Äôs data line countries too. 29m waited get vaccinated month birthday. hate talking everyone stigmizes issue much receive weird looks actively avoid conversation. said know unpopular opinions willing share now.

But first willing accept initially hypocrite vaccine first came found outrageously stupid essentially mandated go maskless needed vaccine. 

On top work collecting information people vaccination status reporting California. made uneasy uncomfortable preached follow science getting erge go ""fight man"".

I also take ADHD medication affects heart doctor could tell effects vaccine mixed medication. I've looked tried find studies. Obviously new none really done.

I'm gonna pretend knew without shadow doubt would new variants vaccine would become useless believe would eventually mutation vaccine would less effective against. 

Nothing news really changed mind except effectiveness vaccine againt prevalent strain. Along finding myocarditis medication prevalent thought. 

I got covid Jan lost two family members it. believe exist either. Someone else broke circle trust got exposed decided tell anyone. 

Lastly probably one I'll get hate accepted fate pandemic bring upon us. last time faced Spanish flu looked turned out? Exactly politized BS that's happening happened then. I'm gonna sit pretend things ever get back normal. mix AZ Pfizer wondering well actually is. breakthrough infections unlikely become new outbreaks. That's whole reason CDC lifted mask guidance vaccinated data came back indicating robust antibody presence mucus membranes (eyes, nose, throat, genitals) would reduce shedding infection breaks vaccine's general protections. completely passive waiting period. Keep trying/asking get second shot. supply Canada solid now. quite possible take you. 

Try right now. going +1 buying pulse oximeter, thing literally saved life back around Christmastime.

Thought COVID getting short breath kind activity. going suck wait 14 days long felt fine sitting, saw O2 levels 80s, realized time go ER (where discovered *didn't* virus, two serious pulmonary embolisms)

As preparations... map fastest route closest emergency room, buy good air purifier, whatever parents might need they're able leave house bit. isn‚Äôt wrong frustrated us right thing got vaccine. listened didn‚Äôt spread lies, wore masks, followed guidance health officials. 

I totally get people legit reason, sick dragging minority country stupid. 
The pandemic primarily affecting unvaccinated point zero sympathy eligible people refuse take it. 

By taking vaccine, choosing put others danger based ignorance stupidity. yes, fuck people. Foxtrot Uniform Obviously aside worst outcomes, smell thing biggest covid fear. would destroy food also I‚Äôd significant safety worry detecting smoke, gas leaks etc. already hear angry Americans ranting government run health care, rejecting getting free walk vaccinations several locations near them.  better order body bags freezer trucks. know, wear masks. Delta variant alone 225% communicable.  Duh we‚Äôre talking vaccinated people masks provide marginal increase already protected individual really worth ex like (anti vax). full custody three kids. next week doc loading accelerated schedule. Oh, two already ASD spectrum vaccines, there's Different countries gave vaccines different intervals changes effectiveness different countries different end results delta seems strain immunity more. 

Israel‚Äôs data criticized since one knows arrived figures they‚Äôre outliers generally speaking also unless you‚Äôre Israel got vaccine intervals probably aren‚Äôt going super relevant anyway. Let know changes tune bill comes. Wow. Ok. weren‚Äôt testing asymptomatic positives original studies? thought already announced me. returned pre COVID life like rest people state Colorado. ok, way see cull least 1-2% antivax population next years. Evolution full display. happened BC? ontario opened vaccine clinics walk in. appointment needed. weird 2 provinces different vaccine availability like take masks then? point wearing like chin diapers. want people get vaccinated, we're stage consequences like thing left really make impact. agree this, i‚Äôm getting really irritated media scare narrative virus. people dying choosing get vaccinated, don‚Äôt see problem personally Lol, everyday come numbers publish actual data Since data outlier compared basically everywhere else need release methodology  fuck virus making comeback 60% US population vaccinated like 30-35% population already virus? Outbreaks *among unvaccinated players*. punish teams breakthrough infections. good news read day getting first Pfizer jab! know wait get 2nd jab full protection, I'm glad got Pfizer. think anyone does. make worse everyone else, that's makes virus horrible. thought FDA official released mid winter timeline... that, January/February? 40k supposed documentary Suffering bout pride, huh? Wear bit longer waiting what? Vaccinations readily available yet going snails pace. exactly would accomplishing besides delaying inevitability unvaccinated people getting sick mask go away later since global virus immunity? definitely different flavor profile, lol. Also, ""hesitant"" vaccines necessarily mean hesitant vaccines general. Can't fix stupid.  regardless media trying push, statistics overwhelmingly clear blacks Hispanics antivax, white Republicans associated significant decline new COVID-19 cases introduction policy. 

Are controlling restrictions implemented time? Poor, poor multi-millionaire.  whoa, surprise! There's Pfizer booster planned August.  probably opposite. Anyone who's wearing mask assume vaccinated taking procautions. choice really yours. I'm vaccinated wearing mask. guess JJ right would absolutely go 'first' dose mRNA. There's literally barrier right taking vaccine someone else, they're everywhere. head. initial question making decision science CDC guidelines based on?

And feel however want I'm looking actual data following CDC guidelines

I'm saying CDC still saying people pre-existing conditions, people U.S., *should* wearing masks, implication someone wearing mask following ""science CDC guidelines"" wrong. kind sounds like want point fingers everyone wearing mask accuse following feelings science even though majority probably *are* look many pre-existing conditions are. agree could use data drawing solid conclusion maybe, see extend assume data actually wrong judge others making assumptions.

So agree? never said current science wrong. said: seen enough data say anything like confidently...my point hard data this, maybe let's make confident declarations yet.

I'm telling put mask on. I'm saying stop judging people continuing wear either choosing cautious *doing exactly CDC telling do.* ‚ÄúThis virus real you‚Äôall‚Äù ignoring science then... hold antimaskers disregard view antivaxxers think it'll get slowly, late wave future years. 

New employees first (requirement apply), existing health care patient facing, support staff, spread industries  Thanks! :) think businesses seeing damaging outbreak profitability; we'll likely see coming weeks. G7 countries, people enough time least first dose, doses many cases now. time drop politeness start penalizing think know better medical experts. school doesn‚Äôt start august 30th Israel contradicts data real world results Canada, Singapore UK, release methodology.  Glad see broken infected, seriously ill, death. it‚Äôs consolation sons school one outbreak, 3 students class believe got infected social setting classroom. school immediately closed classroom sent class home two weeks. spread. wear masks spread others

wearing masks never protecting  ‚ÄúThe 88 percent effectiveness Pfizer vaccine delta also getting symptoms. effectiveness hospitalization death found even higher, though measured study.‚Äù phobia needles. child foster care, abusive foster mother child diabetes, needles always around. foster mother threatened needles saying turned vegetable - happen left home. 1978 left lifetime phobia needles. got vaccine knew necessary. barely felt like anything gone second. got I'm glad able also. virus killed many liberals could. they're mostly vaccinated. call troops. running war attrition, see. new poor would mostly liberal less insured would die more. could afford sacrifice poor conservatives before, stop. Kind of, they're putting others risk vaccine work can't medical conditions. Idk- Ask mechanic, seems authority things. said 3 times still dumb time. Stop repeating yourself.

I fun winter. slopes like last winter. 

Feel free wear mask winter hide house want. prerogative. good. TWIV two saturdays ago... sure DeSantis? DeSantis care restrictions here? ""Come 2 weeks bro"" Asshat perfect here. He‚Äôs got head really far rectum. sorry hear that. There's never good time Covid, early days terrible time it. know work treat it. Unfortunately lot people really fighting chance. right. one seems want take charge necessary end pandemic. keep going forward setbacks people cooperating. Employers ask employees vaccinated. cannot ask proof. One county who‚Äôs covid numbers really rising put mask mandate back vaccinated certain types business employees only. Customers encouraged mask required. official ready take step go back statewide mask mandate. really don‚Äôt see making selected employees wear masks going help customers far number employees. vaccine prevents hospitalizations... many people still get knocked week catch COVID even vaxxed

plus there's whole spreading unable get vaxxed part Encourage vaccination honest us risks. Otherwise, let cards fall may. Thank you! can‚Äôt wait! Quarantine areas/cities would solve issue. fact would pain ass cost lot money still cheaper current method.  Let‚Äôs honest probably won‚Äôt survive second round anyway.  really grow dumb there. Oh please. recommendation change shit. read data false, uptick younger people intubated Alabama... zero Covid deaths 40 since vaccines rolled out. says lot things retracted get vaccine many vaccinations sites placed neighborhoods? I'm pretty sure related signal strength.

You wait Elon Musk's orbital mind control relay satellites come on-line they'll able blanket earth proper coverage finish activating chips. welcome life... successful get, sacrifice others even hospitalized. sad.  Would admit headlines dramatic main goal passively get younger people get vaccine? Media allowed NYC hospitals peak would done wonders. guess that's illegal reason US going way UK has, also much worse vaccinations. I've heard stories people catching covid second time. findings always totally different every country? Something appearing methodology. fit anyone else reporting. Ah! Xmas remember üéÖ Internal polling?

Maybe finally hit population dying (rural/Southern/unvaccinated) predominantly R voters can't afford party shrink already has.

Nate Silver also made point likely issue voters care next year's midterms. Americans adults (and thus majority likely voters) least partly vaccinated -- may feel kindly towards unvaccinated folks dragging pandemic. Especially many refusing vaccine political grounds. grandma Alzheimer's home. One nurses admitted breaking public health orders visiting sons town multiple hours away (inter-regional travel banned time). One visits involved wedding. seem think anything wrong that, despite residents workplace even allowed outside, heckled parents come visit me. let anyone become nurse? WTF old you? point politics way affects physical realities COVID interacts human anatomy. quarentines apolitical. folks would agree you. inconsistent messaging problem. Meanwhile, much world still unvaccinated far vulnerable virus's spread result relaxed containment efforts. Okay, make rules, need ""emergency use FDA approval authorization!!"" 

NOW!! presentation materials today's meeting. look ACIP meetings YouTube, June meeting posted 2 weeks fact. made reminder calendar look recording couple like last presentation one we're interested know though? using assumption evidence, work? many factors take account ending surge. People deciding hospital overflowing enough reason lock would also end surge without lockdown needed. Generally surges end without general population making type adjustment, even 1918 people knew importance masks self isolating areas hit hard Spanish flu. KN95's ordered AliExpress last March? Useless better cloth? Whatcha hiden? Something want world know? wake people are:

1. cult
2. Brainwashed social media false fake info.
3. denial
4. belong 70 percent world population average 85 percent IQ.

üòê‚òπÔ∏èüòê LOL realize EXACTLY wear masks covid? prevent droplets spit/spray contain virus spreading one person another.

 convinced saying satire, there's way someone walk directly point like comprehend it.

If understand surgical masks protect droplets, questioning saying ""hard tell?""  Scary headlines labeled lies people refusing get vaxxed right now, pictures/videos labeled staged.

The majority refusing vaccine cannot convinced.

Due relative low effectiveness vaccines delta, vaxxed people need mask up, lock let morons kill off. Chances country come side better. toddler can‚Äôt get vaccinated won‚Äôt wear mask. chucklefucks putting people real risk long term damage. get 9% figure? Gotta thin herd.

Can‚Äôt change stupid.

People asking around knowingly spreading pretty much bio terrorists

Change mind?  Redditors way accepting bringing back mask mandates lockdowns anyone else country, it‚Äôs like whole bubble reflecting national opinions. insinuating israel part real world? data literally realtime study performed, whereas study retrospective. S√∫per bowl surge, Easter Day surge, saints Patrick day surge, Cesar Chavez day surge, cinco de Mayo surge, Memorial Day surge LA. course it‚Äôs easy call 4th July surge. It‚Äôs summer surge like saw LA last year. covid make nautious puke? cdc says fully vaxxed people refrain testing following known exposure asymptomatic.  understand position, certainly see would feel way.

However wish you‚Äôd reconsider reserving amount empathy &amp; sympathy unvaccinated well. Consider example roughly 50% white people unvaccinated, versus 65% African Americans. know (I hope agree anyway), lingering, systemic disadvantages Black people US years. Don‚Äôt think issues- many directly affected quality education educational opportunities- contributed disproportionately low percentage electing get vaccine?

To me, that‚Äôs sad situation personally one deserves sympathy. Thanks sharing! Sounds like superspreader vaccination event. guess everybody got double antibodies weekend... smh  first thought meant car driving without insurance, *hope* illegal everywhere, think saying basic coverage, missing policy/rider benefit (e.g. car rental accident) they're trying add accident? Pfizer developing one targeted delta variant. unfortunately it‚Äôs starting trials next month think it‚Äôll awhile probably get text/email 5/6 week mark lucky willing travel get appointment right 7th week mark first dose. That's experience (including friends family). Good luck.  irony‚Ä¶ Make sure bill accordingly then.  encouraging sense formulate booster alarming variants meantime hospitalizations deaths look like India April. husband tested positive. Peaked fever last night 100 degrees. lost sense smell today. fully vaccinated. Fuck shiiiiit. vaccinated still wear mask indoors. problem it. little bit helps. still smell dads farts almost everyday maybe get vaccine. family Cleethorpes virus absolutely control there, first 2 waves barely knew anyone infected.
 
Now everyone, 1500+/100k cases 99.99999% effective. That's huge difference considering 350 million people US. real infection risk person walked past grocery store. family birthday party attended cousin's house.

Yes, people need vaccinated catch cousin asymptomatic infection rough cold, like mask mandates helpful unless also come ban visiting people's homes, that's going happen.

As punish? People like gotten vaccinations contributing heavily spread. people need staying home going follow recommendations they'll secret parties raves family dinners like last year. would need mask I‚Äôm vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt vaccine work ? I've trying find answer question can't:

When FDA gives vaccine full approval, health insurance company refuse cover Covid-related care patient refused vaccine zero medical basis?

Ethical question aside, I'm curious even legal.

I suppose slippery slope. There's lot dumb things people choose (or do) reason directly create costs insurance cover.

But, life insurance deny benefits survivors tons reasons related behavior. Auto home insurance same.

Can health insurers choose same? suppose they'd write policy. even allowed? Yeah actually want ""vaccine passport"". 

Vaccine verification new thing, live time real good. shouldve thing first person got vaccine outside trial. understand. phobia irrational fear, can't waved away easily. hope helps bit worried needle adverse. Also remember delta variant killing children now, last heard 400 childhood deaths it. Masks needed point since lot kids, even teens, vaccinated. want hook reimbursement IOC lost TV broadcast contracts. forced vaccinations 

Why foreign concept? went college 2000s, show proof several different vaccinations could attend (and get one summer before, meningitis IIRC). Exactly. every 1 trapped burned, 100 kept going windshield ejected etc. hard feel apathetic. someone repeatedly punches face, many times gonna tell stop punching face let want. super interesting. remember read this? Meh. would think children DYING would thing finally stimulates change, would wrong. learned Sandy Hook slaughter tiny 6yo children. Even horrifying event enough evoke change. Idk‚Ä¶maybe there‚Äôs magic number finally makes people sit decide enough enough. Sandy Hook, know 20 dead little children enough.  bill everyone pays premiums, fuck asshat.  Cole Beasley happy! üòÜ consensus among epidemiologists according Fauci? Well phobia, course easy. I'm glad got vaccine! Thank keeping community safe I‚Äôm starting think even without vaccines surge would still happen like last summer. I‚Äôm expecting huge surge winter well lockdowns. Smh thanks China pretty incredible science, vaccines, health applications well. studies going mRNA treatments cancer. doubt it. think want go herd immunity, best strategy remove mask usage. everyone vaccinated pretty much guaranteed get covid point near future. live armpit unvaccinated midwest - Kansas. Definitely surprised.

What's hilarious there's idea ""inability"" enforce mask mandate. many people get tickets wearing seat belts exactly thing. public health measure.

Any sherrif willing enforce laws swore uphold fired immediately. science science according science, Fauci. seen Fauci cite single study claims I'm reluctant believe provide concrete proof. (i'm one family get vaccinated different auto immune conditions age


cool straight lying then?

stop spreading vaccine misinformation. also fire male guards harassers? definitely here. got private message day calling spineless rat telling go get COVID lol I'd entirely okay shirts saying ""MAGAvax"" vacine herd immunity

Unfortunately realistic really never been, variety reasons - terms transmission discussing, ""'Herd immunity relevant transmission-blocking vaccine. don‚Äôt, way get herd immunity population give everyone vaccine,' says Shweta Bansal, mathematical biologist Georgetown University Washington DC."" Note blocking/preventing != reducing. That's pretty informative read talks lot transmission.


I think ""during worst surges"" certainly sounds reasonable opinion appreciate response. insane think people basing vaccination status word news hosts, I'm also surprised all.

Personally, think there's plenty information someone make informed decision vaccine. want get protect themselves, protect others, whatever reason - go it. someone research decides would better take it, understand too.

I believe general responsibility protect others, however believe ever require anyone get something injected body. sympathize trying protect immunocompromised problem wearing mask, however also feel unrealistic expect Americans long term (again, honestly care less need wear mask).

I'm sure there's easy answer either way, shame turned 'us vs. them' conversation. Hopefully get positive news point. Americans, that's 104 degree F fever. surgeons use surgery ""hard tell?""

Droplets. (""They're meant protect wearer contact droplets sprays may contain germs"" -- never considered effective something spreads sharing air people. way. interesting article [KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor: Words, Six Months related ongoing research project tracking public's attitudes experiences COVID-19 vaccinations.

The article section ""Why Adults Remain Unvaccinated"". Quoting remain unvaccinated asked main reason getting COVID-19 vaccine, commonly offered reasons around concerns side effects (21%), followed concerns vaccine new, unknown, tested enough (16%). One ten (12%) offer haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated don‚Äôt think need vaccine. Smaller, still significant shares, say haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated want wait see (7%), don‚Äôt trust vaccine don‚Äôt normally get vaccines (7%), medical condition prevents receiving COVID-19 vaccine (7%), think COVID-19 bad vaccine worse (7%).

I recommend going entire article well. sorts information people's attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. example, takes look people feel taking vaccine. Thank reply. wish best luck staying safe Covid free! Sweet. mRNA stuff Star Trek magic, getting started. Sounds like effective vaccine me.  Yep! teachers schools blamed close go fully remote! literally never end. Also 2020 2021? Especially 2020... would like 11/12ths classes normal (assuming quarter system). 2021 would 3/4ths normal. 2022 onward might worse, still, make sense. absolutely USA division. huge thing especially rich, western societies.
Makes think. edit post link story posted down. data talking seem valid, something people take consideration deciding whether vaccine kids.

But still think parents given choice soon possible, explicit acknowledgement may taking risks fully quantified yet. may still worthwhile tradeoff, example families immunocompromised member, children families whose sense civic duty compels take small risk order protect community. Absolutely. Hopefully people change stance. Assholes assholes though. realized it‚Äôs ‚Äúhurting wrong people‚Äù. seatbelt traps burning wreckage!  people vote republican likely die virus least likely get vaccine. hurts chance midterm. However, I'm selective sleep use condoms birth control mean stop sex either.  unlucky

I say unlucky much stupid. 

They *could* got vaccination, because, ya know causes adult onset autism, cancer contains government tracking chips.  can't understand something.

With UK Israel population highly vaccinated, countries seeing cases rise. 

My friend, gf, manager caught covid, even though fully vaccinated 2 weeks ago.

I'm scared.

Will ever end :'( What? want vaccine get, know ignorant? getting vaccine Louisiana. hear coming also, sooner dies, sooner there's 1 less body virus use mutate more.  That‚Äôs awesome hear! trying fear monger anything - restaurant visited San Gabriel haha. I‚Äôm hoping one-off but. 

I felt sense anxiety washing walking establishment seeing every table packed - people waiting line seated without masks (I ordered take btw). American parent freaking high-risk son going back school, reassuring. school requiring masks. Thank sharing data seems indicate Delta likely result severe illness Alpha, much contagious leads infections logically result severe cases. mean, 'folk tale', article says may well true. saying anecdotal, need real hard numbers whether widespread trend, localized trend, occasional occurrence. I‚Äôve feeling along I‚Äôm glad article written. many different reasons people worried getting vaccinated, grouping together crackpot lunatics think know science anyone isn‚Äôt going fix things. 

The Daily Show feature African Americans reluctant get vaccinated ancestors might medically experimented slaves. Familial trauma real.

A lot unvaccinated people boomers, lifetime seen governments justify three illegal wars. doesn‚Äôt warrant lot trust it? 

Also, know day heard Pfizer developed vaccine felt uneasy, knowing many lawsuits involved in. Covid vaccine made lot wrong people extremely wealthy. 

Fear blame shame cause people feel cornered constant fight flight mode, cuts completely.

FYI, I‚Äôm getting jabs soon I‚Äôm able (Australian) Well yeah. would inject something thats 
not fda approved? Matt Gaetz guess. Boosters aren‚Äôt recommended US. Well truth rates low, likely going happen -- start factor united States whole numbers mean almost definitely know someone die something entirely preventable.

We lock doors small chance someone break in, buckle small chance get car accident, keep blanket trunk small chance break cold. Heck watch weather know bring umbrella get wet. prepared extremely ordinary function modern life. wild think people get vaccinated extremely small chances something bad may happen, ignore much bigger (but still extremely small) chance getting sick dying. preaching choir shows danger herd mentality fear mongering. large number extremely preventable deaths people would rather accept fact life get vaccination goober told bad them. Honest question, scary needles you? It‚Äôs like little pinch, real pain. stresses out? bull? Still waiting get FDA approval kids vaccinated. 

Even crazier recommendations continue wearing masks vaccinated, many young children see wearing masks? see unmasked can't vaccinated 100% know they're following guidance. tin foil hat says people 180 may tied Matt ‚Äústatutory rapist‚Äù Gaetz. 

The deal behind scenes ‚Äúwe scrub leave CRIMINAL cases start promoting covid vaccines‚Äù.

The wrench would Democrats offer redemption arc people could already get rid via ties Matt ‚Äústatutory rapist‚Äù Gaetz criminal cases. Conclusions: mandatory mask use policy substantially increased public use masks associated significant decline new COVID-19 cases introduction policy. study strongly supports use masks controlling epidemics broader community. Nice point new information suggesting shorter time line immunity previously thought. headline doesn‚Äôt speak important angle everyone‚Äôs minds. 88% effective great. 88% 4 months? 6 months? matters apparently. targeting exact region spike protein? efficacy could different [ States might be?]( ) Yup, actually read article one helpful things I've read weeks. Actually breaking comorbidities proving really risk/should worried. exact phobia. blood test years ago still remember horror. arm aching right talking it.

Working way first vaccination tough. got lucky split trousers leaving house. mortified, worrying whether anyone could see, helped hugely getting experience.

It fine - none horridness blood test. feels like light sting can't feel inside - speak someone hyper-aware feeling.

The second vaccination much easier - still afraid, course, could work rationalising more.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately, hate fear needles less death. 99.8% survival significant amount children deaths. Quit fear mongering. There's NYT article week elderly woman almost died hospital COVID barely made it, asked going get vaccine said no. 

These people operate reason logic. Delta  Exactly, couple things need happen mitigate spread. obvious one anyone eligible vaccine get it. Additional precautions like masking social distancing public spaces (especially indoors) would also help. 

At fundamental level - battle human psychology. Almost everyone exhausted, anxious, desperate things return normal. 

However, longer delay taking steps mitigate infections; see rise infections higher potential forced rolling lockdowns. highly localized occur, honest‚Ä¶they probably wouldn‚Äôt even work. We‚Äôre precarious position. Results Among 22 study participants, 13 (59%) emitted detectable levels SARS-CoV-2 RNA respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic patients 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged 63‚Äì5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per patient. Patients earlier illness likely emit detectable RNA, loads differed significantly breathing, talking, singing. largest proportion SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies emitted singing (53%), followed talking (41%) breathing (6%). **Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% viral load detected study**. Sure think reason gonna found PCR analysis appears CT non-vaccinated individual appears much lower (More viral particles) vaccinated. gonna long time understand virus.  get - also think important understand risk. neighbor whose kid locked away apartment past year half. wonder kind detriment vs maybe contracting COVID (which virtually threat). 

When read comments see ton mothers talking protecting kids think see lot misinformation especially left dangers COVID could maybe severe consequences children's development. newsworthy? obvious implication enough non-creepy dudes firm. Why? decent men applying quit? pivotal point CDC lifted mask mandate... 

This 1000% self-induced, Follow Science? course can. (You can't force 'people' take vaccine: make specific employment conditional vaccinated. So, can't force today's staff get vaccinated, mandate staff longer get it.)  already upheld court cases workplace require vaccination condition employment. Whether nursing care facilities wish question.

Just like false narrative say nursing facilities can't replace people would leave: correct narrative nursing facilities can't replace people would leave substandard pay scale wish maintain. Whether upping pay scale workable another question. stupid survive Vaccines 100% effective. Given Israel high vaccine uptake, efficacy hospitalization must 80-90% range, corresponds well countries experience Pfizer vaccine. sort evidence contrary saying words heard? studies Fauci noted peer reviewed released. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

""COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized United States shown efficacious effective SARS-CoV-2 infections, including asymptomatic infection, symptomatic disease, severe disease, death. ***These findings, along early evidence reduced viral load vaccinated people develop COVID-19, suggest associated transmission risk likely substantially reduced vaccinated absurd CDC predicting psychological tendencies unvaccinated people try get wear masks misinforming public - also counterproductive since public trust CDC says. Darwin prefer go people award name? Actually put sleep call.

That's even true quote. Louisiana ranks dead last public education
No surprise result can't fix stupid. unending parentheses hurts..  elderly fully vaccinated, risk dying COVID still low - much lower risk dying due causes. greater chance dying virus elderly, vaccines done tremendous job reducing death hospitalization even amongst elderly. wear ours, unvaccinated child (too young) frankly trust lots people hahaha. 

Our county 53% fully vaxxed, that's eligible persons, total population. there's still decent number masked persons about, thank goodness, still mask us.

He‚Äôd rather hospitalized get shot. Hell 4K ray tracing. Yeah think argument core fallacy like anti-vax movement itself: taking anecdotes common case.

There people, they're especially interesting write news article about, going norm far. Unfortunately, feelings matter court. people died end life patients hospice, average length life less 3 months. hospice recover, hospice die.

No lawyer going take case would certainly lose, care facility would simply say ""This patient hospice already X days, likely would dead X date"". 

A better suit would something like breach contract, facility enough keep patient safe. except, vaccines approved yet, employer would likely face lawsuits mandating them, unless specifically required regulations. would wasted avenue well. 

As long PPE requirements testing requirements met, lawsuit frivolous. staff meeting requirements, patients vaccinated there's little else do.  problem math it‚Äôs like saying 350,000,000 people US 1,000 people died plane crash last five years. everyone eligible counted didn‚Äôt fly.

Breakthroughs/(breakthroughs + unvax positive) Taipei, July 22 (CNA) Taiwan Thursday reported 33 new COVID-19 cases -- 30 transmitted domestically three contracted overseas -- four deaths disease, according Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

All domestic cases reported northern Taiwan, 11 Taipei New Taipei, seven Taoyuan one Hsinchu, Health Welfare Minister Chen Shih-chung (Èô≥ÊôÇ‰∏≠) said daily CECC press briefing.

Although number new cases higher past days, 24 domestic cases known source infection, Chen said.

Only five patients apparent link previously confirmed COVID-19 cases, one still investigation, indicating situation still control, Chen said.

Chen reiterated CECC intends lower nationwide Level 3 COVID-19 alert level expires July 26, long surge domestic cases unknown sources infection.

Meanwhile, three imported cases involve two Taiwanese nationals American national traveled recently Taiwan China, United States, United Arab Emirates. tested positive quarantine, according CECC.

The four deaths reported Thursday two men two women,in 60s 70s, passed away July 19 21.

One them, woman 70s, the¬†first person Taiwan¬†to die infected Delta variant COVID-19 virus, according CECC.

To date, Taiwan confirmed total 15,511 COVID-19 cases, 14,041 domestically transmitted infections reported since May 15, country first recorded 100 cases single day since beginning pandemic.

The number confirmed COVID-19 deaths country risen 782, 12 recorded since May 15, CECC data showed.

Yes. think there's millions millions people think actually eradicate go back world without COVID. basically fact everyone definitely get COVID least justify taking anymore precautions?

Yes, vaccinated. marginal benefit possibly tiny decrease COVID cases justify massive side effects last months.

Did read piece? entire argument people get vaccinated bodies get better better fighting COVID, people's bouts COVID generally become light, long people get boosters, etc. Masking is, near recommended herd immunity(\~90%) significant amount population can't take vaccine yet (kids).

You're intentionally obtuse make point making. 

The CDC lifted mask mandate early. 

And we're reaping rewards that. 

""we need require vaccines""

Once FDA fully approves point requiring masks much simpler. lab leak, really way identify origins? (Genuinely asking) thought immune couldn‚Äôt catch it? Well according anyway right, honest reply would ""womp womp"" sad trombone people would lose shit.

How? Historically, lot pretty much burn population die out. evolve something less dangerous (becoming endemic), we‚Äôve controlled eliminated vaccination (think polio, pretty much abolished, measles, airborne infectious similar level Delta, rarely seen nowadays first world countries outside antivaxxers). Smallpox one killed outright vaccines, process involved literal hold-people-down forced inoculation, which, well, exactly likely happen nowadays.

And wouldn‚Äôt work anyway. can‚Äôt coronaviruses smallpox polio measles. evolves faster kept alive wild animal host populations can‚Äôt realistically vaccinate. goal get enough people immunity either vaccine infection get point people aren‚Äôt dying. We‚Äôll likely get hit variants every years (think bad flu season) we‚Äôll probably periodic vaccine boosters. around, won‚Äôt anywhere near common currently nearly everyone level protection.

And yes, think we‚Äôve done public disservice thoroughly drilling everyone‚Äôs heads even mildly symptomatic infection virus SUCKS. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like cold flu‚Äù doesn‚Äôt really explain medical perspective, moderate illness still means pneumonia even mild illness still knock ass several days.

I really fail see issue. currently live life much like pre-pandemic. Go restaurants, meet friends. don‚Äòt even notice mask anymore. mask quite frankly unnatural. social animals born well maskless.

So glasses. clothes. vaccines. surgery. medication. seatbelts. seen much unnatural lifestyle sitting greatly affects health, unnatural thing do?

If want forfeit whatever 21st century offer live like cavemen, guest. I‚Äòll pass offer though. yet suspended... Lol

It's advocating *actively* killing people.

It's saying, want idiots, stop them. know what's anyway. people actually listen yourselves? person misguided actually psycopath. going avoid getting exposed indefinitely? Unless want wear mask rest life, stop wearing point, COVID waiting do. Getting asymptomatic mild case best outcome hope for.

The vaccine best have. Masks made lot sense delaying exposure vaccinated. fully vaccinated decided never vaccinated, now's good time pull bandaid off. Nah dude doubled, tripled, quadrupled lmao ‚ÄúPut know know where‚Äù  vaccination rates blowing roof, Fauci said vaccination topic become politicized. countries topic already ""politicized""?

It's still plenty politicized here... divided zero noticed mine fear needles completely unrelated pain. fear pain needles, fear metal stabby thing inside body. Waiting 2nd vax right now, looking forward looking forward 2 weeks it. True, unhealthy lifestyles spread social vectors infectious mind. one saying medical care denied, maybe irresponsible folks paying it. Smokers pay premium lot health insurance policies, antivaxers? Re: kids: low kids risk. depends infectious breakthrough cases are. Like 39% effective preventing infection vaccinated people lower viral loads (as seems case) might see moderate increase. Thanks! found Twitter thread gave broad strokes might check video too. care really.

Lol, cannot recall ever seeing low key ""meh"" attempt red pilling people. DeAndre Hopkins Twitter last hour also good point. waning immunity playing role efficacy drop bad Pfizer really needs consider making booster strong possible. There‚Äôs reason vaccine fade away require booster reason less year. You‚Äôll easily lose future willing participants way. people fine getting new shot every year don‚Äôt see many people ecstatic getting new one every 6-8 Months understand guards doors case people try leave, I've read mainly seem bringing parcels/takeaways rooms. they'll two men time chaperone other, could hire women surely (for room service type stuff) use hotel's staff. alarmed read guards keycards rooms! There's need that. Unfortunately enough time studies confirm. projections: Years lifetime, caveat virus mutate substantially.. Well guess continue so, ultimately long lasting virus maintains current spike protein form. guess year tops - like flu vaccine urged get every year, time we're dealing lethal covid. We're fu*ked.  rely single negative test result evidence it. countless people test negative times positive test result. MIL tested negative 3 times lingering issues symptoms. 4th test showed positive. Historically good enough. Flu vax 40-60%. good enough longer? appreciate little often current spike happened. glimmer hope. Vaccines offer 80-90% protection, amazing. 100%, though, case numbers matter - 90% less small number ignored, 90% less huge number still much. number cases around vaccinated absolutely changes big effect mask top is, absolute numbers.  correct! Lol I'm dying  Maybe it‚Äôs me, fully vaxxed canceling trip plans two weeks. know breakthroughs rare don‚Äôt really want risk it. risk increase Covid cases increase.  numbers become much better realize vaccinated, person vaccinated, likelihood transmitting low. hey didn‚Äôt wear masks anyways even confronted.  seems we're not, since regions US, example, issues adequate critical care capacity hospitals.

Your theory great. unless vaccination rates go up, especially southern US, outbreaks exceed medical capacity serious risk.

You downvote like like that, change truth. want like. practical reality. get used able laugh managers' stupid comments lately. * Johnson pharmaceutical researcher put getting vaccine. wants it.*

I speak here. first Pfizer shot (in March) presented following side effects:

Not lot sympathy get vaccine opportunity... worked school two years kids public Ed past 17 years, there‚Äôs flu schools never got it, there‚Äôs way weren‚Äôt exposed. see mean . German institution issued recommendation regarding heterologous vaccinations J&amp;J. [They idea might exposed?  Arkansas Delta variant:

There 40 ICU beds‚Äîmany small hospitals iffy specialized care‚Äîavailable statewide last night. 

Two hospitals filled.

Multiple hospitals already expanded covid wards. Visiting hours, public accessible areas hospitals altered. 

Hospitals Little Rock warning elective surgeries postponed canceled. 

The ratio daily positive tests hospital census almost double Delta end June/first July. (Data used report linked two weeks old.)

New cases Tuesday: 1,875

New cases Wednesday: 1,459

So, two days expect 1,834 need hospitalized, 611 needing intensive care.

It took original strain 7-8 months Delta done 6-7 weeks. 

Arkansas Covid Forecast July 13th: seven week gap plenty walk clinics now. probably get second dose exact 7 week mark. thing older people mostly vaccinated younger mostly aren¬¥t. scale numbers older younge younger larger group people. doesn¬¥t mean younger people entering ICU like crazy. It¬¥s matter scale Delta isn¬¥t deadlier, infectios. headlines younger people get vaccinated, good intention provoke missinformation. 


Keep safe!  Court battles expensive. GOP's opinion, although seem think lazy democrat zombies decide get vote. Well excellent test theory. compare upcoming surge previous ones (subtracting vaccinated) test see lack restrictions makes difference time  Ahh yeah believing science equality don‚Äôt go hand hand leftist ideals, mean lot leftists, communists, tolerant far right ppl hate.  wait 7 weeks, enough supply vaccinate every single person 2 doses now. got text book 2nd dose literally 7 weeks day first (this Monday). Tons appointments everywhere. Yes I‚Äôm US. still see people wearing masks NYC, even park. think it‚Äôs silly make statement like vaccinated people never go back wearing masks, because, course, sensible people need do. 

Not everyone wear them, many vaccinated people living lives without masks, continue live life masks needed protect communities. going continue course handling virus needed outbreaks dogmatic statements.  deny stuff time. Im sure write clause cover covid related treatments refuse vaccine. They're private companies cover whatever want, consumers dont *have* buy coverage. *He* may willing pay it, he's using *our* resources nation so.

Selfish dipshit. sounds great, say life going live hit zero COVID life want have.

How could talk hitting zero COVID say impossible next sentence? Unless referring near-zero COVID? using creative metaphor pandemic eventually declared over? Good clarification! house fire, it‚Äôs pointless put spread again.

Disabling replies. loved one getting sick needing medical attention hospital. neighbors kept insisting ""it's flu"" ""God take care them."" Well wife hospital 10 days husband recently got 1st shot vaccine. Resisting urge ask ""I thought God gonna keep y'all safe?"" ""how's Mrs. Neighbor dealing flu?"" 

Fucking dumb asses. Better late never guess. saw picture man wearing Socialism Distanced T-shirt caption, family asking prayers ventilator days.  I'd curious know well. perhaps lack data suggests vaccinated people suffered long covid? (pure speculation part, course)   True. spent hours ER getting hit car. well enough walk, bottom priority. needed x-ray, probably would faster find regular clinic machine. surge new cases, Fauci said doesn‚Äôt believe U.S. officials renew calls nationwide mask mandate ‚Äúbecause lot pushback that.‚Äù

The fact serious issue zero faith species. Canadian here. confirm that‚Äôs why, buoyed trust health authorities (though got plenty backlash) education system prioritizes science. here, seems like got politicizes partly comes education USA includes denialism science (eg. Teaching creationism), general split based deeply religious lines? wish knew reach people though. reports front lines people begging vaccines intubated awful, ones nurses abused sick patients don‚Äôt believe covid. It‚Äôs depressing. Simple 

Vaccianted people gonna lockdown protect unvaccinated people. So, would dumb get vaccines, attempt contract Covid 6 months later self quarantine order get another boost antibodies?  health officials could see data significant number residents died transferred hospitals. state health commissioner, Dr. Howard Zucker, aware early June officials department believed data good enough include report, according two people knowledge discussions.  Probably many people would obey calmly, imagine bunch people would searched police brought kicking'n'screaming vaccinated. would quite sad view.

Maybe try softer methods first. Try giving cash bounty exchange vaccinated. crank vaccination coverage high enough, one could try limiting society unvaccinated, allowing entering restaurant without proof vaccination. Ikr people twats realized voters die, wont win elections. priority them.

In McConnells defense though, encouraging vaccination pretty much since vaccines came out. may shrewd partisan, dumb. article says it‚Äôs *1000 times* higher. likely plenty change mind see Delta variant relatives, sadly.  world work absolutes like that, 69% constitute high exposure 70% confers immunity.

And yet ignoring fact plenty places near levels vaccinations anyway moot point. Plenty people high exposure areas. inferred CDC changing guidelines experts kept repeating last weeks tv, news articles, etc.

Okay, point hard data this, maybe let's make confident declarations yet. vulnerable probably would too,

You since would following CDC guidelines.    I'll never understand employers forcing employees anything facility home. shit stupid pandemic ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Thank you.

My son discuss daily. trying decide one get, one safest  

I need know dangerous idiots keep trying scare me, say is. 
Everytime say want go get it. get bombarded fear stuff. 

I nervous person. lived whole life according freaking fear!!! wish could stop. u/Unique-Horse referring insurers refusing pay out, guy seeing light. think lot people initially assumed track 0 covid successfully vaccines driving cases down, thought room ""free riders"" trend, benefiting reality good also able say better ideas ways appeal anti-vaxxers covidiots types.

Now half way summer clearly track zero covid. massive reservoir people south vulnerable covid, almost spitefully determined expose it. They're realizing change course, they're track Jonestown. mean ... think required anything mostly...but forced medical procedures pretty cool.  *knew* some, yeah. friends conspiracy theories years eventually spiraled flat earthers toxic around. 

They used fun hang back like early 2010s. I'm okay 99% death, going wear mask till gone, may never happen keep get reinfected making mutations. let clear: variant dealing ought scare crap you, virtue much efficiently reproduce itself. going LOT virus floating around, continue mutate. lot people going sick, going die, suffer long haul covid issues. absolutely everything stop spread. 

Beyond talking sick dying, think impact covid far economy. jobs lost, businesses closed, shortages increased prices pretty basic commodities. I‚Äôm pretty sure government can‚Äôt continue afford prop economy don‚Äôt get top this. It‚Äôs flu, it‚Äôs national emergency happening every nation earth.  average latest studies... seems \~83% effective. good. think really mostly future votes, full stop. current surge, likely annual fall surge (looking mostly problem unvaccinated), going deal COVID directly affecting lives significant numbers conservative voting base.  take *everyone* gets sick ending hospital intubated. enough patently obvious suckers COVID debate. workplace too. Although HR record self-reported vaccinations, still think people going lie. cube foot away cube neighbor, there's really space apart. wear mask daily sucks work home exact thing. Last year teaching person ordered whole bundle KN95s site NY Times recommended legit. I'm vaccinated longer masking, good quality relatively inexpensive. also nose clip thing stick face. Site bonafidemasks dot com.  charcoal filter would probably reduce bit. bought one sourdough starter (city uses chloramine, disinfects water... flour) actually use lot drinking water now. keep topped fridge, much convenient ice water. realize American diet awful &amp; Americans overweight obese Okay, want figure ""how effective vaccines preventing deaths due COVID-19"". that, need know two facts. First, many vaccinated deaths been. Second, many vaccinated people would died vaccinated. second piece missing calculation 99.999%.

We know article vaccinated death rate 1 100,000. article provide us second piece information. easy obtain, either - specifically want know many people would died period they've vaccinated. let's take (very) rough estimate, demonstration's sake. 

There 26,562 covid deaths NJ. population NJ 8.8 million. Thus, current covid death rate 300 per 100,000. quantity after, since accumulated 15 months different levels outbreaks, something work with.

So, unvaccinated death rate 300 100,000, vaccinated death rate 1 100,000, would effectiveness be? Certainly 99.999%. comes 99.6%, looks similar (they're 99%), hundreds times less quoted effectiveness.

Again, truly accurate calculation vaccine's effectiveness death, estimate 300 100,000 truly quantity after. hope shows calculate effectiveness. 70% chance get Covid someone it?  
Or 70% less effective (won't get really sick can't breathe loose taste long time)? Money everything recovering, getting finally tomorrow. going get vaccine? No,"" Roe said. ""Because there's many issues vaccines.""

Let's real, underserved communities can't research covid info phones, they're using social media apps either. Mild *and* severe. Actually, told 70% study three weeks ago. fully vaccinated North Carolinian since February I'll say still wear mask indoors places. probably everywhere again. would expect that, long restrictions put place, cases grow basically every unvaccinated person infected, right? usually say week change mind  you‚Äôre referencing 12-17 year olds, vaccine absolutely recommended data. Covid worse, 

What data? Clearly goverments experts disagree UK goverment, also German one advise. go ahead think smarter experts.

[""Until data become available, JCVI currently advise routine universal vaccination children young people less 18 years age. JCVI keep advice review safety effectiveness information become available use COVID-19 vaccines children young do, you‚Äôve already decided wearing mask ruins school year that‚Äôs you.

I wanna see friends' faces graduate :(

Yes, fully agree masks work, pretty good job wearing still required. I'm one Q nuts. agree they're necessary, *temporary* inconvenience time being, still consider uncomfortable alienating; that's false dichotomy. like fog glasses prevent fully naturally interacting classmates.

I think ensuing psychological effects COVID restrictions youth development interesting study. Wonder uptick PTSD collective generational trauma, like world-wars. agree that... im saying stock market fire past year. did. Trump came w/ pro vaccine message months ago. even acknowledged mostly people voted turning down, wished didn't. gives hope... Hope effing dumbasses thing, thereby reducing chance procreate further... Personally, I'm going sit back beer, bag Doritos lazy-boy, set 'recline' watch morons confirm Darwins theory natural selection... bet next Wednesday beliefs become part identity attack attack you.

Peele really good rationalizing away beliefs came non rational reasons. feel like know something they're letting on.

Then again, maybe they're backtracking realize disproportionally base affected wave due vaccinating. missed point. left market would end situation like described. leave market allow mass-congregation unvaccinated people.

Ideally mandate vaccines everyone. many options effectively mandate vaccines without *actually* mandating them. that. even researched table 1a

that exact study, Centers Disease Control, says hospitalization 96% protected, sorry lying 


they‚Äôre best inventions 21st century, stop lying least make getting vaccinated mandatory requirement public. want vaccinate? Stay property rest life.

The next best thing holding people responsible prosecuting criminal negligence resulting death, perhaps manslaughter/attempted manslaughter, like people lied HIV infecting people. Looks like need hire TVA  Requiring vaccine (or case, vaccine PCR test) events seems nudged friend mine get one. media doesn‚Äôt tend mention it, still people US aren‚Äôt absolutely anti-vaccine also don‚Äôt think COVID huge deal. anyone sort anti-vaccine starting get spooked recent news, get one event would great excuse let save face. ‚ÄúWell, still don‚Äôt think COVID dangerous, really want X, went ahead got vaccine.‚Äù

I‚Äôve also heard people hesitant fear miss work due side effects. Businesses government could step offer support cases. feel like offering hundred dollars case lost wages plus FMLA-style guarantee can‚Äôt adverse employment consequences take side effects would help. latter really simple; believe odds almost everyone vaccinated would miss 0-2 days work. would help assuage fear practically cost. seems unlikely assistance offered large scale. 

Of course people practically unreachable, still believe lot people could swayed.    Maybe start live streaming intubation 88% article ""any symptoms"" lean stupid. Tell vaccine enhances freedom allows get bigger guns Biden taking credit Trump's hard work vaccine enough people get vaccinated Trump reinstated president. Easier demonize people call stupid consider people (actually people) make decisions regarding risk levels feel comfortable order contagious, virus replicating body much start shed (spewing nose mouth). 

If immune system tuned virus, either prior exposure vaccine exposure, eliminate virus chance replicate enough start shedding. 

Of course many factors play this. immune response isn‚Äôt sufficiently robust virus may opportunity replicate enough shed viral particles. delta variant virus infectious takes fewer particles someone become infected, small window shedding wouldn‚Äôt enough infect someone original strain may enough infect someone now.  Yes, good riddance. Anti-vaxxers difference opinion, people dangerous make life difficult stressful everyone else. also much better excusing enabling them. too. I'm going blunt it:

* someone eligible physically able get vaccine hasn't, that's them.
* someone unable get vaccine, necessarily them, either. continue wear mask, ask wear mask makes comfortable. However, think entire world stay home people immunocompromised. 
* continue go world mask around people, get sick, that's me. I'm fully vaccinated, younger, healthy, likely fine. children home come close contact immunocompromised people (to knowledge). fewer people get vaccinated, hospital beds available? logic beyond stupid. Yes, fully vaccinated family member spent hour someone positive. Said family member never developed symptoms. Yep lol RemindMe! 2 months ""Florida Covid cases"" Fauci gone full circle telling unvaccinated people ""there‚Äôs reason walking around mask"" telling vaccinated people ""might want consider wearing masks"". article three weeks old. article (already posted) much recent. I'm curious anyone hospitalized, much specific bill? That's good point, compare apples apples. Dancing J&amp;J. get shot could go clubbing without test, night. 

And testing door clubs bad, kids(im officialy old notished writing kids) giving eachother qr codes said negative get test all.

And negative tests good 40hours could go clubbing 2 nights   *Finger monkey's paw curls* Well... think effective least places high mask compliance would avoided big second third waves.

They probably good margins, they've blown something actually major impact course pandemic; experts pre-2020 right couldn't, least kind cheap masks us wear.

But like said original post, issue effectiveness needs studied, even though mask mandates around long time, still mystery much good do. Better yet wear mask time. want consider

I think anything wrong headline. people interpret differently says, them. attitude, I'd put money Medicaid receiving bills coinsurance deductibles. That, tune might change gets mail month lawsuits cruise lines requiring vaccinations exactly? actually critical time start getting shots. numbers growing due people about, real surge starts gets cold again, sometime september october. someone starts shots now, fully vaccinated aug 26-sept 2. see close getting next fall season. people want protected, need start shots, right now.  start differentiate cannot vaccinated refuse get vaccinated making condemnation comments? Disney **W**orld **W** water Florida surrounded water.

(That's mnemonic remembering which.) understand huge issue think implications. People want go indefinitely. Okay. mask quite frankly unnatural. social animals born well maskless. consequences children growing never seen peoples faces formative years?

We've seen much unnatural lifestyle sitting greatly affects health, unnatural thing do?

I understand mask needed situations seems like one thinking implications.  Well, plan B. I'd prefer mandated France, doubtful be. I'm Canadian, federal government even want push Canadian vaccine passport, suspect election year want controversy. would provinces anyway mandate province run conservative, that's happening. 

So plan B would least offer safe harbour vaccinated people.  jab job. simple answer questions money know...Jeff Bezos rocket! Maybe would willing handle guys bil...Nah!! Whew worried precious stocks second. Carry on. Thank you. 

They lifted mask mandates area. can‚Äôt take store, museum, Storytime library. can‚Äôt sign gymnastics dance classes. It‚Äôs little sad. 

Yesterday governor announced going let school mask mandate expire renew fall. signed Threeschool, now, don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶. unvaccinated even admitted told stay home. There's 88% chance symptoms all, therefore spread (assuming mRNA). Unless going covid zero laughable goal (see Austrailia NZ) sort restrictions normal life remaining 12% chance. Especially incredibly unlikely would ever give another vaccinated person. would absolutely fine except sniffles. 

This vaccinated people. Unvaccinated people catch covid die care, problem single person United States lift pinky help more. need 2 sets rules. 

The exception course children, thankfully severe covid children rare vaccinated adult.

Covid something never going away, like vaccinated people country never going back life like pre April 2021. You‚Äôre really smart! Want good star? Yeah, internet representative reality.

I'm assuming place live, masks either reimplemented never lifted begin with, since said wear gym on. Making vaccine mandatory requires certain amount political will. political divisiveness issue, political make happen.

END COMMUNICATION Also article even says 30 49 people age 80... people expect vaccine make immortal? even fall/winter? really hope right, impression always would one additional surge come. want exactly ringing endorsement mandates. I‚Äôm going Hellamega Tour concert next month. guess probably wear mask even though fully vaxxed May? This. mask mandate something comes back, better come vaccine mandate. don‚Äôt want get cycle mask mandates cases rising falling we‚Äôre still going population unvaccinated choice people natural immunity susceptible Covid isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon. quality life noticeably approved since highly vaccinated state dropped mask, glad wear 2020, certainly won‚Äôt happy wear one 2021 people didn‚Äôt get vaccines like supposed to. 

Basically, government better find way mandate vaccines. mind asking, long 2nd infected? 

Do know / infected started showing symptoms? looks like waning immunity Israelis first vaccinated Dec January. admire someone stands guns. definitely can. UK pretty far along Delta surge hospitalizations nowhere near previous waves. CDC reported Florida number today 12,647 new cases increased 3,659 yesterday's report 8,988.

Redditors same? general idea may gotten it? ask like, ""OH - NEVER GO FLAMINGO!"" whatever, curious something like work vs public place. yeah, might know hey - hurt ask. guess mild infection vaccinated cases time takes bone marrow vaccine response kick circulating antibodies diminished? discussed another thread somebody said insurance could deny coverage vaccine refusers affordable care act. sure legalese works maybe come Congress eventually. Decline likely caused covid able grab hold people outside unvaccinated youth. I'm virologist, take grain salt. think shows Infectious delta barriers place. realized GOP voters likely unvaccinated ergo likely die. Genuine question. would wear mask vaccinated? helps protect others you, others. Exactly. obviously huge overlap antivaxers antimaskers. lot people getting vaccine wear mask. tell people, vaccinated need to, even though target goal yet, enforce anything unvaccinated people said, whatever, neither. genius Governors School Boards sending 25-35 unvaccinated kids classroom school hundreds thousands unvaccinated people, without mask requirement. could go wrong? actual videos people dying death bed wishing got fucking vaccine. macabre, that's society now. Obesity isn‚Äôt contagious. can‚Äôt give obesity.   one main reasons went J&amp;J, plus one done. Vaccination panacea. Get vaccinated. Wear mask. Distance. well 50% vaccinated Colorado. Last checked 60% completed least first dose still increasing rate 10% per month.

Even Delta dominant strain nobody wearing masks anymore, hospitals fine beds.

Not states full morons. always think ""wake calls"" different clips news COVID survivor doctor saying much danger younger people kind silly right now. Like, year half pandemic, someone going think, ""This COVID stuff kind serious, maybe look it..."" That‚Äôs good, i‚Äôm runner everybody know gotten covid (unvaccinated), still trouble running  stopped us vaxxed. yeah 3 months ontario, surplus vaccines think everyone wants one got one June/July. 2-3months astra zeneca since needed time develop antibodies gf got moderna vaccines month apart. study posted day saying 2% (mostly light symptoms) I've never seen 9%. That's insanely high.    Yeah trying figure children grandma want get currently available healthcare, would even go hospital? Deny all, pick chose!    hospitalizations not. missing something here?   Awesome dude. Thanks. Look, troll. article November 20, 2020, long Delta variant started spreading around US. discourse good faith, you‚Äôre trolling. Never stopped Chief! Nobody stopping wearing n95 public holy crap that's long wait. ticket sales tiny pittance revenue Edelman mastermind behind Covid /s Double nothing. Remember viruses infected cells duplicate greatly time. 

Totally made number, double viral load might really mean ""infects cells 2% faster"" 

They found 1000x viral load though, might explain increase hospitalization death rate (some studies found around 2x those) 

But -- 1000x viral load translates 2x likely negative outcome. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

The effective things think of: 

* Outlaw [false statements guise news show.
* Mandate vaccines everyone pay hefty fine. got rid smallpox.  7 weeks relative risks age group haven‚Äôt changed. Holding vaccination status constant, older risk negative outcomes (the exception newborns infants slightly higher risk older children).

NFL billionaire dollar industry, they're gonna let personal opinion fuck profits. would wear mask you‚Äôre vaccinated? That‚Äôs dumb. obvious virus would higher viral load. 

The virus could spread faster could survive longer air, could make people cough more, could exist inside people's body longer without presenting symptoms, etc.  
Heightened viral load seems actual answer though instead. Unvaccinated individuals wearing mask period

I would assume they're making comeback unvaccinated people wearing mask, kind vaccine passport system place businesses verify who's vaccinated isn't. anecdotal, great hear! whole last year change felt like taking crazy pills. like waking decent chunk population started doubting world round. can't wrap head around it. article posted sub well claims 44% breakthrough infections US immunosuppressed people. large  People choose vaccinated given lowest priority status hospitals. Insurance companies contractually bound pay whatever share medical expenses. special covid client share zero, basically federal mandate. proposal treat covid like medical expense, create slippery slope.

Now, proposal quite attack lower income groups says medicare/caid treat covid differently covering unless vaccinated, really evil insurance company thing.

As far slippery slopes go, would surprising lack vaccine give higher insurance prices (like smoking) vaccines fully approved. could feel mine. second hurt little first. mom joking must got placebo second shot pretty much serious adverse reactions everyone else family (minus 94 year old gran) wiped theirs. get golf ball sized lump days shot (totally normal hurt) little tender touched went away couple days. minimize point (which read ‚Äúwe take Delta seriously‚Äù), hospital capacity doesn‚Äôt start zero. They‚Äôre usually pretty full.

Are reasons non-COVID baseline could higher time (such pent-up demand)? people south can‚Äôt. Seems like least one every family. Glad get anyone else sick hope recovered. sad. Florida go back like two weeks. They're allowing guys reschedule?? Ontario second moderna originally September 10th, I'm 3 weeks second shot. Nursing home LPN here, confirm.

Old people vote, old people die COVID. This. informative answer thread. Thank you. think makes lot sense studies seen. 50 cases per 10k people Missouri means 1 case every 2 square miles

10 cases per 10k people Los Angeles means 1 case every block. WAY worse high-density areas, especially exponential growth.  Call local officials lol

No one thread telling ""it depends"" kind thing. people get relief it. But, seems us already suffering anxiety - makes worse. yes, THIS. idea breakthrough cases lead long covid. listening interview founders support group long covid mild case Covid resolved quickly. problems started several weeks after. fact vaccine prevents serious cases necessarily reassuring.

I'm glad subject intense study. know more, keeping mask on! virus clearly went brain.

Such juveniles I‚Äôm done caring. I‚Äôm vaccinated everyone love. people still don‚Äôt want believe science, I‚Äôll gladly stand way natural selection it‚Äôs thing. Good riddance. Guessing unmasked? Ugh, I‚Äôm guessing need cancel Vegas trip breakthrough cases. 88% effective preventing infection. friend‚Äôs mom got covid fully vaxxed, though. She‚Äôs 50s overweight. sick week, she‚Äôs fine. Could‚Äôve lot worse without vaccine. Oh logical standpoint realize extremely unlikely serious negative effects virus. time though, never vulnerable kids. It‚Äôs 12 Monkeys point  would‚Äôve right Trump encouraged people get vaccine good ago believe.  saw today showing even lower efficacy. know, hate it. Welp, factor anti-vaxx fantasy draft year.

Jokes aside, good move. athletes really need set example. would lie?  That‚Äôs next obvious question rabbit hole. ‚Äúthey‚Äù gain. Hell, vaccines free. got J&amp;J 3 months ago get another vaccine? long took symptoms go away, take anything it? I'm repeating myself: packet goes away shortly FDA approves it; DeSantis's anti-vax law doesn't.

Soldiers required take vaccine, exactly like FDA Approved vaccines, think that's fantastic save many lives.

Kids required take vaccine across country (except Florida), exactly like FDA Approved vaccines, think that's fantastic save many lives (except Florida). can't find tweet, sure? don‚Äôt know US, sorry. UK free pharmacies suspect that‚Äôs case there. :( completely misunderstanding me, I'm saying lockdown nothing reduce deaths infections. think they're extremely ineffective, think surge show that, since worse previous surges even without restrictions place So? number children 12 anything minuscule, number people responsible children‚Äôs well being. least able reach able reconsider stance/opinions. think awesome changed mind sharing story. mean...that's nurses continue treating him. others deserve die stupidity? kids hospitalized it?  Well it. investigation needed. That‚Äôs Canadian study people referring to, they‚Äôre referring Ontario study active first half year prior Delta taking over. 

This Alberta data however interesting I‚Äôll look it, make sure contains enough Delta I'm sure trying hard defend highly questionable data set whose methodology still disclosed.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre getting defensive. You‚Äôre projecting. I‚Äôm saying Israeli data perfect even remotely true, Canadian study consrantly cited cannot used refute it, since used barely Delta. Nice DIY EMP plans bought back Mad Magazine finally good use... Oh there's still Lots anti-vax morons here... 'specially BC, benefit anti-vax national news network. Gee, really surprised this. Seems character. don‚Äôt think CDC advocating honor system, leaders don‚Äôt willpower put teeth behind it.

You would think people would follow honor system huge health crisis sadly demonstrating forced right thing *shakes head* 

‚Ä¶  

*sigh* comment many months ago, changed tune ""if vaccinated pandemic over"". link study? honestly think viral load high Delta variant going see breakthrough cases lot reporting people don‚Äôt get tested would they. vaccine don‚Äôt feel bad. think going spark surge cases. know people past week vaccinated COVID none vaccinated people last year. Obviously could lottery fallacy experience extremely rare, seems odd. saying don‚Äôt, you‚Äôre flippantly disregarding human life. every number see person. You‚Äôre advocating infection community equals death. bad take dude. don‚Äôt forget crippling medical debt! true. I‚Äôm still wearing mask go supermarkets etc. don‚Äôt give ** people think there. So, couple things however know long term side effects vaccine

This illustrates lack understanding vaccine interacts body\[1]. mRNA well-understood biological construct worked decades. vaccine really is, strands mRNA encased fatty sac prevent mRNA denatured delivered cells. mRNA teaches cells create spike protein COVID-19 virus uses attack cells, triggers immune response. body remembers identify foreign protein future neutralize get full-blown infection.

After mRNA used cells, broken disposed way cells breakdown mRNA produce naturally. traces vaccine flushed body within days receiving seems silly put young healthy people risk vaccine damages. always risk long covid, risk weigh

The long term risks COVID infection much greater vaccination. Also, getting vaccinated risk spreading disease loved ones unwittingly risk petri dish virulent deadly version virus.

Get vaccinated.

\[1]: vaccine mean get infected

It means danger infection small enough negligible. spreading misinformation inferring otherwise.

If can't accept risk vaccinated people wearing masks minimal enough never accept risk level literal 0% never happen.

In area rate infection low, applied nation wide we'd around 3000 deaths year entirety United States. that's still enough people. never be. want Israel data literally study, published anywhere. bunch slides government presentation. think they've examined methodology showed data. Thank you! Oh sure. family member come business north bullied wearing mask. Mind people 40s 50s. sad. even raided lady's house. Oh sure, died directly Covid. NTA, put everyone around risk effectively dug grave. deserves pity most, sympathy. Dangerous idiots scorned. Masks work ways used correctly. former coworker friend making fun virus put ventilator. Pretty much. 39% effective all, would completely control situation case.  hard US mandate vaccines eligible, barring religious medical reasons? carry 1? breakthrough case. fully vaccinated pfizer April, right symptoms extremely mild cold. Somewhat sore throat, achy, lots fatigue, sneezing, mild cough. guess still vaccine working still feels pretty weird unexpected! I'm trying let shake confidence things know data feel really unsettling. this, 100%. 

The outbreaks happening areas hurts side. I'm guessing toss-up state like FL, significant portion supporters get sick and/or die, could flip elections. many variants went entire Greek alphabet start using US Military Phonetic alphabet. Amen lol DemonSantis really trying kill state This. able independently review they've done far analysis goes, maybe worth looking into. given data fit single study, idea arrived conclusions, means I'm inclined believe stage. heard hospitalization still even though cases Yeah, mean know many protestors wore masks, considering masks effective social distancing annoying see one report it. There's way get believe covid running rampant increase case rates large groups people got together every major city across US also many cities world. Masked not. so, align social distancing reason shut country first place. good news, I'd say. Glad feeling better! Thank God mutations tailored make virus infectious lethal. Imagine chaos would ensue... I‚Äôm assuming initial 94% metric made Pre-Delta? so, testing asymptomatic vaccinated people time? countries vaccinated recently though, antibodies likely higher. Canada UK used longer 8-12 week intervals also likely produces better immune response. Based article, Israel saying efficacy varied dramatically depending person vaccinated, would tend point towards waning figures also show among vaccinated January, 16% effectiveness infected, compared 44% vaccinated February, 67% received shots March, 75% vaccinated good news is, protection hospitalization still remained fairly robust, 88%, little drop people vaccinated January (it 86% them). us jobs. enjoy ubi pay highest 7 day avg since 7/7.


Nice see rate going up. think lots still unvaccinated thought could coast backs us vaccinated way Covid zero. 
Delta variant came along pretty much destroyed idea, getting infected seems unavoidable now. Especially going try live normal life. Also looking minimum 70% vaccinated even touch transmission rate here‚Äôs question Israel data stuff‚Ä¶ many breakthrough infections asymptomatic? saw another study said Pfizer vaccines 88% effective symptomatic delta variant infections. I‚Äôm scientist, vaccine doesn‚Äôt put magical force field repels virus, simply means body immune response ready attack reduce viral load get infected, reducing severity chance spread others viral load less.

If they‚Äôre including asymptomatic cases, wouldn‚Äôt fair assume it‚Äôs close irrelevant even you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre still going ‚Äúhave virus‚Äù even brief period time? that‚Äôs case really cares, won‚Äôt get sick won‚Äôt go hospital viral load likely reduced nothing shorter period time unvaccinated people.

Headlines like cause ridiculous panic‚Ä¶ want see methodology otherwise reeks Pfizer wanting push data way encourages world buy another round booster shot. Aren‚Äôt named Greek alphabet? phonetic alphabet. learn live certain number (mostly unvaccinated) people dying year, heart disease diabetes epidemic, largely preventable set diseases. shutting McDonalds demanding healthier food public good? No, we're not, accept grim reality deal consequences service corporate profit unhealthy lifestyles. Covid integrated sub-optiomal condition. sucks immunocompromised, elderly, obese/unhealthy population, life, fair. Shhh. don‚Äôt use common sense here.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Okay, let's agree agree then. I'm judging you, issues anyone wearing mask never have, came across way apologize. ask also judge vaccinated person so. much confusion coming from. say ""effective"" headline bury ""effective"" means article 90% people going read anyway. really want know sinovac too, country mostly used one :/ messing somewhere. Zen 4 architecture microchips :D

Being public person all, really hard take vaccine rejected long. would admitting idiots... applaud action, like applauding child shitting floor tender age 10.

I likely never vote Republican, they've show loyalty Trump themselves. Insurance companies starting charge full price hospitalizations since Covid19 preventable disease. Government help ends September, terms many things like taking work sick due Covid19. Tax credits.  got shot? Take 10k taxes. 

Find right number get jabs. CDC ones announced vaccinated people able go maskless prompting nearly every state immediately follow CDC guidelines. actually think honor system going work unvaccinated people continuing wear masks required. minute state followed suit CDC recommendations almost everyone went maskless. another wave illness dangerous one that. horse left barn. going pretty hard get people back masking again. looks like CDC don‚Äôt want back peddle officially recommend masks again. Florida decent vaccination rate though. It‚Äôs national average Yea hopefully Florida going back way reporting data. slightly egregious instead purposely inaccurate data data. That‚Äôs said gets full approval. want people get vaccine maybe don‚Äôt act like asshole people want wait approval. want hesitancy, keep telling people hope it‚Äôs forced upon them. It‚Äôs winning strategy sure. lol no1curr. anti-COVID vaccinators also owners un-vaccinated cats dogs?

Or get shots pets refuse shots themselves? would asymptomatic suggest lower viral load, regardless variant? need mandatory vaccination policies many places possible. Employers, flying, going school, etc. thing combat effects misinformation. public messaging strong enough. Exemptions people unable take vaccine due medical reasons course.  I'm talking certain areas U.S. guess clarify. Liberals real leftists, they're left american conservatives. Yes, incredibly. booster shot likely available then. woke fact people dying Democrats. Yeah, still happen. See one 117 medical workers somehow brought lawsuit hospital: Insurance deny coverage COVID related costs people refuse vaccinate. I'm Orlando right next masks worn. world talking mask mandate? Idiot. long term effects known. Long term effects hepatitisC =cirrhosis liver cancer, long term effects HIV = (AIDS), long term effects Human Papilloma Virus = cervical, anal, throat cancer.  Etc etc.  Hospitalizations deaths almost entirely among unvaccinated, vaccines still working incredibly well. current PCR test detect small virus particles well viral needed get sick. vaccine stops getting seriously ill, job. FUKING LATE. blood hands. Desantis.

He never vaccinations far could tell. Florida one fastest rollouts US one first states prioritize older people along front line health care finally realized what's pretty obvious, COVID19 killing mainly people vaccinated, point 30%-40% population make voting base. left moderate voters gotten vaccinated, base holding now.

With House Senate control grabs 2022, can't afford lose voters, either death disillusionment. make major mea-culpa 180 vaccine COVID skepticism. Who's going back masking? question healthy young people first place. Wow, thanks, know that. mean sound harsh (truly) friends believe Q-Anon conspiracies let delusions influence life-or-death decisions (i.e., getting life saving vaccine). downplaying influence Q-Anon dangerous Q-Anon dangerous normalized. hate wearing masks. wore KN95s 8 hours day work year despite people say here, it‚Äôs uncomfortable. gym mask also horrible. It‚Äôs hard understand others saying masked social aspects gone, can‚Äôt mimics interactions feel colder me. obviously didn‚Äôt whine anyone wore long.

I personally would take risk breakthrough case means going maskless gym night special event friends. I‚Äôm young, don‚Äôt children, risk-benefit cold vs enjoying youth wanting work gym become fit set head, that‚Äôs me.


Unless wearing something good like well fitted KN95, mask won‚Äôt protect anyways, especially Delta. I'd something like cruise ships like ""tuition unvaccinated students: 1 million dollars"" Oh navy? Good fucking luck refusing second gets FDA approval branches military mandate shit. body belongs state get say lmao.

Also continuing refuse past arbitrary demands approval met childish. Try telling commander lmao. THIS! ABSOLUTELY THIS!! similar thoughts. picture COVID-19 vaccines released insurance companies something SIMILAR ‚Äòpre-existing‚Äô clause‚Äô deny coverage increase rates! Plus patient can‚Äôt hide medical record. Solid upvote you! think killing enough make difference elections certainly care voters outside that. Yup. like two week period offered area back vaccines scarce. pissed. let get single shot mRNA. plenty them. like us J&amp;J forgotten. Thanks. Worried 3yo get us gets sick. We‚Äôre vaccinated. That's issue. 18 month old. I'm seriously debating quitting job, PhD program that's fully funded. I'd income need. I'm mentally tired. I‚Äôm convinced even perfect world everyone gets vaccinated would eradicated. mean maybe, since it‚Äôs 100% spread protecting I‚Äôd imagine we‚Äôd still cases albeit low numbers. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll convince everyone take it, even it‚Äôs FDA approved, proven safe, etc. think thing people get vaccinated rely protection. It‚Äôs big deal get vaccinated Trump got. drugs experimental get special approbation use them. available common pleb.

Nowhere mention hydroxychloroquine.  think fact speaks itself. Thank you. people deserve good nights sleep, besides means equipped save lives. hand laying sofa trying hardest get infected / infect anyone.    hate much probably works vax lazy. I'm even gonna call hesitant lol. Heard thing, read viral load seen significantly higher delta variant, vaccinated asymptomatic delta might significantly likely infect others vaccinated asymptomatic alpha. you‚Äôre vaccinated hanging around immunocompromised individuals, still take precautions.   too! cannot wait day two littles get it. ""Something something Jesus sissy liberals I'm idiot something something incest."" ignore mandates refuse leave get kicked establishment. vaccinated right fight back. Florida: America's stanky, unwashed taint.      see main point agree. time, also probably inaccurate say vaccinated people sure put back well. blanket statement kind work country. Vaccinated people Alabama Texas quite different vaccinated people New York. Even recent recommendations vaccinated people state still wearing them. definitely mixed situation coming months. lol sure would remember saying something ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù guess nothing [Trump say something Correct I‚Äôm wrong intelligent, vaccinated people wouldn‚Äôt necessarily care positivity rates, unvaccinated people likely don‚Äôt care either would get vaccinated. exception could see people can‚Äôt get vaccine. Call Devil ask cold right now. people's solutions... No, really. Keep mind chugging along US half million per day. That's huge number steady. Thank you! Oh every insurance company allocated $ pandemic flat out, regardless clients hospital not?
I see. going forward maybe insurances cover clients back regular ? know insurance company waived copay weekly therapist pandemic. point vaccine prevent serious illness death. Asymptomatic spread even studied trials, bonus. friend works Google California. figured would amazing health care plan employer still pay $50 every time kids goes family doctor. vaccines defeated diseases fully block transmission

Right, there's ways 'defeat' disease outside herd immunity.

'Herd immunity relevant transmission-blocking vaccine.' - saying tomorrow find current COVID vaccines reduce transmission rates 45%, would still considered ""transmission-blocking vaccines""? believe that's proper interpretation message mathematical biologist trying convey.

And that's even mentioning points article raised. either way, herd immunity realistic.

I'd also cautious comparing COVID diseases ""defeated"" past. Unless want suggest specific examples directly compare, pretty apples-oranges statement make. FDA authorized emergency use Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine prevent COVID-19 individuals 16 years age older Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).

(applies others there). They're intellectually dishonest say stuff like ""oh, well that's FULL approval"" blah blah blah. doubt. curiosity, live anyone? so, ever end catching it? Yes, wife double vaccinated AZ. 190 units per ml 10 weeks second jab seems really low compared Pfizer. interesting see UK efficacy AZ relates hospitalisations next couple months. can‚Äôt understand people voting you. Children 12 can‚Äôt get vaccinated, yet, you‚Äôre absolutely right. garbage human being.  FDA already said variant specific boosters need go full trial. rely past safety data need determine efficacy. 

Moderna studying new booster now.   Delta spreading quickly among unvaccinated. Hospital workers others suffering result.

What actually want? don‚Äôt understand vaccinated people worried then? everyone vaccinated couldn‚Äôt still catch delta variant thus need wear masks? need rabies vaccine due possible exposure get human immunoglobulin injection along first vaccine dose. body takes days begin producing enough antibodies immunoglobulin injection provides protection body ramps up.  still need three vaccine doses. repubs speak poison forked tongues. üò° Technically takes 30 mins me, since wait long time after, see point :P world always different was. never regained ability walk friends airport gate 9/11. that's okay. adapted. *They realized voters ones dying now. 

Fixed ya There‚Äôs little common sense days, seems getting worse. It‚Äôs bad think rename rare sense. Yep. work grocery I'll student teaching elementary kids fall. going awhile feel okay face exposed! I'm risking health, anyone else's.  think legal repercussions sure.  hero f\*cking need. doctor Alabama said one last things patients intubated due Covid-19, beg vaccine, tell late.

I always impression it‚Äôs time intubated, probably aren‚Äôt well enough hold conversation. false. death toll accurate be. controversy whether deaths hospital deaths nursing home deaths.

Imagine completely avoidable third wave though. That's efficacy reported day 1. civilised society seek protect weak vulnerable. he's really saying is: ""ive botched messaging catastrophically, finger pulse American public life, I'll softly advise buy mandate anything fear"". 

This guy supposed top dog. word *should* foremost word wisdom comes deal this. Unfortunately public health experts cataclysmically botched messaging they've cried wolf many times. sketchiness inconsistencies forced corner, *want* recommend things know damn untenable theyve crying wolf (with varying levels validity, agree with, mind you) year.

These people dont care job, mental health, family life, 1 top concern weigh nothing else slowing COVID. unfortunately them, US life mostly moved COVID Centerpoint. even Delta nonsense even shred threat vaccinated individuals, word (which still meaningful, isnt) invalid. spent validity eyes many Americans long ago back tracking misrepresentation. 

So what's really happening here, he'd *like* enforced unnecessary stuff maybe sorta possibly somehow minutely decrease spread statistical outlier populations, would require group effort part vast-mega-majority. knows there's zero traction there. Best mask mandates making illegal require vaccination status public venues. Fuck Ron Desantis. little, late. saw post earlier said encouraging Floridians get vaccinated, see this. result see whole bunch little kids getting sick. ‚ÄúWhat even mean?‚Äù

Have many political sites?

Republicans hate Democrats liberal leaning states. Democrats hate Republicans conservative leaning states. mean 2 thirds hope someone's told already I'm proud you! vaccine mandates school. reason mask mandate ever happen covid19, vaccine mandates. Yup. smiling eyes lot last year.  Russia... One step forward 3 steps back. made get 2 shots instead j&amp;j. fare shots. tried sign every single trial would take right could. considered fudging 11 year old‚Äô sage (12 Dec) felt wrong it. It‚Äôs like shooting self foot instead head. imaginary scenario - maybe. Thankfully issue Colorado. Lmao c u ron states really need this. It‚Äôs super helpful honestly relieves bit concern many vaccinated people see it‚Äôs still primarily unvaccinated hospitalized."
