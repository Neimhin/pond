Ok yeah, bedtime....long day, sorry, I'll see out.  ‚ÄúHow still spreading everyone vaccinated??‚Äù -Unvaccinated Person Ending could defined becoming endemic, like coronaviruses influenza. even state severity would stronger severe influenza wave, already tenthousands die every year. premier isn‚Äôt even going along countries reopening plan making own, relies WA reaching 90% fully vaccinated absurd.

The country consistent ""reopening"" plan, even complicated places inevitably involves degree closures/introduced measures. NT's plan similar, instance.

Either way, current projection 90% Jan 10 (this'll slip back), 80% Dec 10 (this moving forwards), date's set stone 80%, know unfortunately every time get single case state premier buts whole state super strict lockdown allow leave house 4 reasons, sucks.

The last time happened late June, Sydney's Bondi cluster spread here. spent 3 months lockdown, delayed longer. spent days, delaying.

It's really bad trade-off, honestly... nightclubs missed 6 weekends since May 2020, 9 deaths total, unemployment 4%, there's metrics come favourably, frankly.

All _3_ add months delay opening, nothing ""overcome power"", rather task threading needle right - exit without unnecessary disruption. How? spread among unvaccinated, change Delta? spreading fine Alpha stage.  Oh I‚Äòm saying can‚Äòt get control. noone gonna Germany. Contact tracing saw coming since early october. basically still wave 4 started towards end summer. Experts warning since least noone took serious measures made real plan ‚Äöpeople act reasonably‚Äô (because worked well last year /s). Even pull stops started stopped next weeks. winter bad. bad.

If 2g, actually adhered properly checked 80% vaccination rate things might different now. don‚Äòt though. ship sailed winter. got option lockdown doesn‚Äòt seem coming anytime soon letting run wild minimal measures come weeks late seriously alter anything what‚Äòs happening right now. stunning moment 25 years ago, getting car ride someone considered (with good reason) highly competent, highly intelligent.

We're chatting that, somehow, dinosaurs fossils came up. Dude started telling God planted bones test faith....I literally form shock couple years cast iron perception intelligence held more-or-less 1 1 correlation bullshit detection... unequivocal proof face, proving otherwise....I major adjustment.

In weird way, think ironic proof problem itself. held totally, utterly fallacious view world worked, zero clue, like think I'm usually total idiot.

I think takeaway get fact 'garbage in', BIG deal, that's DISinformation KICKING ASSES right now. know, responding many comments underneath calling implemented whichever country posters from.

Edit: I'm saying like see implemented country, although would. Singapore free healthcare, weird mixed system saving plans state dictate cost procedure least affordable (and subsidies also help) 

Covid cures exception completely free.

Now threaded like illness. still able access subsidized rates use Medifund pay them.  expecting something different usually means. example, h1n1 also pandemic crippling still pretty bad. either young notice directly impact remember, lasted year pretty bad flu variant, still flu end since suppressed it.

That's point, becomes non issue status disappears ""pandemic"" fluff word like treated US many, literally means something. It'll take ages suppress point worry literally killing someone us getting severely sick dared see movie theatre met friend know covid affect someone reach point longer disrupts literally everything, antivaxx/hesitancy/refusual preventing happening sooner.  Whooda thunkit? much appreciate Australia New Zealand done, really can't compare Germany Australia.  Vaccines work best large majority population vaccinated. ""my freedoms"" argument, working society better it, argument.

When someone refuses vaccine, they're refusing stop spread it. aw yes, make already hate vaccine hate even more. 

i‚Äôm vaccine fuck guy thinking? Funny seem control New South Wales, Australia. Delta finally got locked June cases went high 1600 per day. got delayed vaccination campaign going like crazy hit 80% 16s double dosed reopened month ago daily cases low hundreds. expected cases go back thousand mark hospitalisations going down. cases stayed low 100-300 range hospitalisations declined steeply. month weather warming may battle. We've hit 90% 16s double dosed week too. Luciferase everything don‚Äôt like. 

And everyone disagrees Luiferacist.

/s Could 20 control base rate (e.g. count unvaccinated deaths February vs unvaccinated population February) 40 run numbers blindly. bring logic facebook fight... Corporations good. Medical journals Modern liberalism nutshell think voted this. changed go it. harping comes family now. Look five want type lol. 

Irregardless, family always treat family. Spice season 2 think means get vaccine, music taste improve significantly able appreciate deah metal more. people need take walk old cemetery take note little difference start end dates many headstones, impactful difference vaccination. read stuff like commonly within ""Querdenker"" scene. breakthroughs, yeah. vast majority cases non-vacinated keeping wave alife. course like ""why get vaccine high numbers vaccinated"" 

I work sale speak customers situation know least one case someone icu bad condition vaccinated! love comment. exactly feel it.

I believe encourage positive manner show factual information. Although, always throwing facts people become fatigued desensitized. 

I know first hand, attacking people vaccination solidifies ideals even moreso. brothers started skeptical covid vaccine family them. seems increasing attached opposing this. know fact feel attacked. mean one point 5 people yelling one it. could barely get word in. believe pushed hard. One family members forced look Herman Cain seemed pushed away. found think pushing people really way go. 

I remember kid dad would scream me. would throw shit across room said. purely spite yelled less likely it. got older, finally said want something ask nicely, tell why, respect opinion I'll it. on, asked of. problem it, instead listening anything said telling cause said let talk. Something lead stuff getting done lot efficiently. 

Honestly, think giant problem dealt COVID vax. Many feel attacked, identify harmful ideals become hardened push back. adults, act like children sometimes haha. 

If politics put wedge place think would much problem overall though.

Maybe approach different angle. know many afraid specific alleged ingredient instance. live viewing scientists gas chromatography checking certain ingredients prove present? could group pee problem present ask questions. may perfect example, feel like start thinking outside box. back forth arguing cutting it. making worse. 

I convinced 6 friends overtime get vax, changed went it. gently encouraged friend addressed concerns without attacking them. seemed work lot better tbh. Obviously works better someone know though. guy got rabies bat 

from heard pretty fucking expensive shot (or multiple shots), i'm sure case full antivaxxing supposed get before? get measles, need revaccinated everything!? Doesn‚Äôt take years?  ‚ÄúVigilant,‚Äù yeah, great. He‚Äôd done much better say, ‚Äúnine people dead. Go get vaccinated already.‚Äù

But it‚Äôs Florida, he‚Äôd probably get fired. Dear Christians: vaccines contain bioluminescent marker called LUCIFERASE tracked. Read last book New Testament see ends,


Holy shit, wild! people live modern era? hello brat! Slovene here.

Oh look Denmark. numbers go roof atm Oh fuck please tell antivax people gonna arms vaccine, too. can't handle that. Antivaxxers super spreader events.   Carneval fun. already first superspreader event beginning pandemic understand would support don't.

My country universal health care guiding principle 'free point use.'

As much pisses see hospital beds taken unvaccinated, operations cancelled etc., undermining guiding principle slippery slope could open floodgates excuse treat 'undeserving' people.

This could open door privatisation move towards private healrhcare. Something certainly want.   That¬¥s one argument cant speak american numbers. still believe ethically defensible subject child, anyone really, medical intervention stand little benefit from. mandate vaccines here, though take same. Sweden 2021there 76 295 reports adverse affects vaccine (mostly Cormirnaty), 6 017 deemed severe. previous year TOTAL 25 000 reports adverse affects registered pharmaceuticals reported. Obviously negligible risk adverse reaction. 2009 Sweden mass vaccinated 6.5 million ppl swine flu pandemix vaccine. Anyone age 16 eligible. end result 350-400 confirmed cases narcolepsy vaccinated group, adjusting ""natural"" cases left 150-200 cases age group 16-24. symptoms took 67 weeks 2 years emerge. pandemix vaccine 4380 reported adverse effects whole vaccinated group, compared cormirnaty several 10s thousand adverse effects (in sweden). 

We 6 deaths age group 0-9 here, deceased posive test. age group consist 1.2 million individuals giving us population mortality rate 1 per 200 000. Sweden wide spread infection testing children outside hospital care, estimating CFR would hard. 1,2 million cases 15% population confirmed infection. Even assuming caught every infection (and one could assume infection rate 0-9 age group general population) would mean 1 30 000 CFR (6 180 000). risk weighted risk severe adverse effects, short long term. CFR healthy infants RS virus reported mortality rate 0.5 1.7 percent, comparison. 

But say. make informed decisions.  Cats, dogs, mink. stop pretending vaccines require two doses three. Take boosters. 11.75 year old thrilled get first jab- difficult find appointments Vermont without travel rural parts state species? people don‚Äôt live Singapore, sounds amazing, however situation weird, say least.

Singapore de-facto lockdown since July 2021, despite 85% vaccination rates. Adoption contact tracing technologies less mandated government, since can‚Äôt member society unless give Singaporean government access precise location time (the app asks enable precise location turn battery optimisations would turn location access save battery).

Despite everyone wearing mask everywhere, vaccinations highest world, basic freedoms table: yesterday, music allowed anywhere, groups meet 2 people, BBQs banned, alcohol banned anywhere 10:30, sports also banned.

Including children immune deficiency risks. 

If find ‚Äúyour local epidemiologist‚Äù Facebook, post today explaining mandate rubella vaccination children population-wide benefit. rubella doesn‚Äôt tend affect children severely, contagious sever pregnant women. This, vaccinating children disease helps protect community particular risk. bit weird take away care less others do, whatever. Good luck. Maybe they're ashamed reason? fact fatal deer scariest part this. killing them, maybe would run course eventually disappear become minor issue.

I know enough deer management (I wrote whole book whitetails) tell probably impossible vaccinate meaningful number whitetail deer outside controlled situations enclosed areas. looking past failed experiments trying use chemical birth control control whitetail numbers demonstrates impractical inject anything significant number wild deer. Hunting help situation much, either.

The thing comes mind potential control method would oral vaccine deer possible, stable enough left ambient temperatures days end. perhaps could use salt mineral licks feeding stations vaccinate them. course would also encouraging higher transmission time.

Several scientific breakthroughs would required make happen, expect anything happen soon. High vaccination rates aren‚Äôt high enough. need least 85% population area vaccinated‚Äî 85% eligible. virus doesn‚Äôt know care eligible. ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù 6 months ago need booster dose, ‚Äùfully vaccinated‚Äú isn‚Äôt really fully vaccinated unless you‚Äôve booster dose. sooner CDC admits this, sooner end pandemic. ‚ÄúMissed‚Äù population 1m 1 case one week 2 next that‚Äôs 100% rise cases. Without context may sound terrible. 

Data without context useless. idiots grow safe times makes careless real dangers afflict them, afflict innocent children without choice 16 years later.  should, land fail. :( here, cases one county 55% vax come people claiming doesn‚Äôt work Facebook 80% hospitalized unvaxed. people fail statistics? knew animal reservoirs while, hopes eradication waned long time ago.

In fact many arguing first 2 never month apart.  Nurses quitting droves tons reasons including basic ‚Äúcompassion fatigue‚Äù. Done done.

I‚Äôll admit Covid 2 3 suck bit. Flu like‚Ä¶ nothing. 7yo squirts next day. Thanks much kind words.

I read ""if cringe past, means grown."". 

I try work idea I'm human like everyone else. days make mistakes.    Without severity symptoms, case numbers meaningless. knows many positive flu viruses detect mass tested them. Media stop spreading panic. Even scientists shocked results. sure would help, unless done repeating schedule? 
Right now, people travel, vacation, shop, entertain bars, restaurants, movie theaters, sporting events, etc. Infections go up. Government decides 2 week lockdown. sure it'll help bring infections somewhat. 2 weeks we'd go back people traveling, vacationing, shopping, entertain bars, restaurants, movie theaters, sporting events, etc? infections go another 2 week lockdown 6-8 weeks? every time virus transmitted another animal human (etc.) chance rewrite take new variation.

I thought mutation occurs every DNA copy, including inside body. It‚Äôs horrible honestly insanely overpowered development part measles virus, sounds like something video game first reaction I'm this, consideration made think slippery slope. 

Realistically, healthcare costs society people smoking, drinking, overweight... orders magnitude higher covid. stop paying treatment people overweight, exercise enough, drink alcohol, smoke? go get imaginary health services imaginary hospital. Another data point kneecaps whole ""Vaccination nothing stop infection"" talking point anti-vax weird segment Forever Pandemic types harp on. made comment nearly 2 years ago deer hunting (primarily home butchering) really bad potential regarding Covid. 

I basically called idiot several replies. Back early 2000s, would sometimes go deer lease dad guys, hunt, went take pictures.

FYI it‚Äôs obvious: Luciferases real class enzymes. Lucifer means ‚Äúlight bearer.‚Äù include chemical makes fireflies glow. all. There‚Äôs plenty vax available.  Companion animals, including pet cats, dogs, ferrets.

Animals zoos sanctuaries, including several types big cats, otters, non-human primates. isn't. far remember, never found wild animal circulation discovery wild deer iowa. reports farmed mink europe, zoo animals, reports virus deposits pets.

See article March time, though, intermediate-host hypothesis one big problem. year covid-19 began, food animal identified reservoir pandemic virus. That‚Äôs despite efforts China test tens thousands animals, including pigs, goats, geese, according Liang Wannian, leads Chinese side research team. one found ‚Äúdirect progenitor‚Äù virus, says, therefore pandemic ‚Äúremains unsolved mystery.‚Äù

Things may changed since March 2021, come across reports. wish best, current situation terrible, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll back normal sooner later afraid even suggest get vaccinated. That's sad. cool kids ones dying.   ""God planted bones test faith""

I would assume bats. Way go, Australia! 

I remember hot discussions bad leave Australia society turned kind totalitarian regime rules strict dangerous future country...

It like saying hospital people allowed drink alcohol, kinds fun... 

I wonder experts see effects correct timely measures now. mess living currently. Get bent, Abbott! know, feel like already happening US. People started get tested often, even though paper, appears cases down, deaths still occurring. basically nowadays don‚Äôt go hospital declining badly. 

Where live, county maybe 60k people, getting anywhere 10-20 deaths per week. That‚Äôs insane. 11yo got first dose yesterday! Smallpox eradicated 1980. amount anti-vax efforts make come back, luckily.

Things felt different time next duty, talked colleagues we'd experienced something similar point. couple people leave ED us stayed carried before. hurt, hurt *deep*. arrogant, ignorant fucks almost broke us despicable time already fragile, hanging fingernails (which really short, nurses...) *that intention* - cruelty, internet access near-terminal (*actually* terminal many cases, turned out) Dunning-Kruger. 

I leave eventually, end 2020, order care darling Dad end life. cancer distance risk infecting keep working *and* wanted needed to, due near-collapse community nursing services area. passing, took months work care home frail elderly young adults neurological disabilities/conditions. I'm sure I'll ever go back front lines acute care again. I'm enjoying using experience skills help residents live happy, healthy, quality lives least get called murderer puppet people can't reliably *spell* 'vaccine' let alone understand they're villifying. Plus *always* heartbreaking lose patient, takes extra toll know die - could significantly reduced risk simple vaccine. We‚Äôre human takes toll, I'm done paying now.

Hugs brave fellow nurse mine pond ‚ù§ Word.

As parents recently two choices: hyper focused preventing infection continuing careful (or even before, others begun let guard), take chance may get infected resume activities. latter would fine weren‚Äôt Delta shooting infection rates across world, happened, choices remained same.

The first 12months hardest things lives handling work childcare everything time, understanding people dying best could protect family. Post vaccine it‚Äôs certainly felt like world happy leave us behind didn‚Äôt agree take risk. Britain looked like going shoot started fall consistently. face, looks like would wise age group get boosters? This. states probably sue, like vaccine mandates.  immunity hard drive filled info fight diseases, measles erase data. Unfortunately people going see he‚Äôs Pfizer Board type shit like ‚Äú$$$‚Äù comments. Look Japan evidence quelled. Actually 40000 yesterday even bigger jump know say. last 3 months 2 week lockdown hardest. Streets currently packed towns southern part Netherlands; crowds gather celebrate start carnival season. think number new cases go next week, test capacity reached. 


I'm kinda feeling like character John Cusack 1408 days; thought cursed room while, one point suddenly realised still it. impression escaped crisis last summer, ... this, bit way, kind good? large reluctant vaccine population, mild/non-severe breakthrough cases keep Delta circulating wild, rather snuffed entirely mutate another variant may bypass vaccines entirely. feel like little bit breakthrough vaccinated population keep Delta top (and since we're familiar it, easily controlled/treated mutation)

I know, maybe flawed logic. I'm field. Remember antibodies actively bloodstream.  also memory B cells produce antibodies needed.  antibodies currently mean longer protected.

There studies project natural infection produce memory cells.  Thanks, 3yo can't wait get protected.  I'm expecting eventually roll flu shot. Show up, get flu/Covid shot, way. live that. think two week lockdown would help much really. takes least week, maybe more, lockdown start effect reported cases. means cases would likely higher end lockdown start.

At point would two options. Continue lockdown point longer ""two week lockdown"" come lockdown schedule. Cases would start fall lockdown ended couple weeks rising again. means month start lockdown situation would probably back start. lockdown would delay everything month. Vaccinated deer, anyone? think generous calling someone ""a reporter"" work Newsmax happened kids' doctor office, daughter got shots like 3 months late. still made sure got them. Parenting hard tempting let things go, healthcare can't one them. understand make boosters available begin with. 89% people probably get booster instead sending mixed messaging say... 6 months 2nd shot probably get booster. Thanks work!   that's make religion die ü§î worked someone refused vaccinate kids everything regularly took surfing vacations Central America them. Pretty sure it‚Äôs one reasons ended divorced. What's horror? There's free vaccine turns common cold like Game Thrones Season 8  Sounds like brother. Catches fucking dengue fever. know one pretty much kills get twice STILL WONT COVER virus already humans, need jump back. ""He added ""3G"" requirements, stipulate people vaccinated, recovered, negative tests, implemented across workplaces.""

--------
This probably going biggest change country definitely create friction (protests, demonstrations, violence etc..) someone regular office job small spaces, clients visiting etc would feel safer knowing none coworkers secretly unvaccinated bringing deadly airborne virus another unvaccinated poof 2 team members would gone company month (happened friend earlier last year).

Yes course know carry even vaccinated without symptoms risk serious hospitalizations would lower. tell people play pandemic  Yeah right. pandemic taught us anything contain new wave mere days. Let's get scientific community change name Elohimase. light compound caused God's Divine Light. use name change signify Lucifer always defeated.

/s sad part it'd probably work.  Plus shingles. Hate mom.for letting get measels need prioritize boosters vaccinated people.

It blows mind many booster doses literally thrown trash every day.

A Moderna vial 14 full doses 28 half dose booster shots. moment first (full booster) drawn clock starts vial's life measured hours. one qualified person gets booster shot day particular pharmacy throw away vial end day 13 full doses 28 booster doses. Every. day.

There also limit number punctures allowed vial, 21 people lined booster doses. 20 people get boosters vial, remaining 8 doses thrown away ANOTHER VIAL used 21st person. person comes day, 27 booster doses go trash.

The way rules written right adults qualify boosters suppose get doses, instead we're throwing vaccine away. sounds like criminal. I'd start consider luncheon longer present QR codes proof vaccination indoor dining, infections longer steeply rising.

Yes, areas handle things differently.  Probably right. Though ‚Äúfunny‚Äù Kent variant occurred everyone blaming Kentish peoples behaviour. Indian / delta variant nobody could understand happening. Maybe world wiser smarter Also Croatia. I‚Äôm pretty surprised fact harsher measures haven‚Äôt really implemented yet. worst wave yet we‚Äôve beating previous records easily. I‚Äôm happy see increasing interest vaccinations (as around 50% vaccinated start wave) but, that‚Äôs enough. 

Plus, I‚Äôm due first child within next two weeks‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really nervous hospital. Husband fully vaccinated still‚Ä¶ studies put death reduction 80%-90%. statistics expert strike reliable way understand vaccine efficacy. Insert inappropriate animal abuse joke here.. measurements taken?  Quick, let‚Äôs react! current vaccines aren‚Äôt gonna slow enough unfortunately feel.

I think would, could get enough people take them. Yeah... would likely ended badly. Stick tipping cows... Yes. got explained detail drawings work today :) Thanks input. said thing. FACT: inject vaccine become heavier shot.

FACT: Since inject vaccine one side body, become heavier side. makes off-balance shot.

If happens, world know change days weeks. exaggeration. global food supply infected, entire human race going bad time. Might well infect fresh water earth. Agreed. Unfortunately need kids teens getting vaccinated. mitigation efforts delaying inevitable.  crazy differently people treat this. office never stopped coming work us vaccinated wear masks anymore. Nobody worried it. trust vaccine. worried even go single lunch seems strange me. couple things:

weather favoring transmisson. last winter absolutely brutal

immunity waning: 6 months today many got 2nd pfizer dose. people infected last winter dropping antibodies too. still degree protection, infection becomes much likely. pass without vaccination prior infection.

most restrictions gone holiday travel starting, international travel opening too. likely spikes result.  needs laws people spreading propaganda vaccines causing death millions. preachers selling silver liquid politicians spouting conspiracy theories people listen need heads examined maybe put institution.  ""sane"" part society folks think logically reasonably. People choice get jab not, number reasons. vaccinated, good go move life.

I understand obsession vaxxed crowd unvaxxed. feel like feedback loop people get social media making shit much worse too. kid remember mom sister kind crystals shit basic spiritual ""this makes feel good pretty"" kind way. they're full blown reiki chakras bad spirits kind crap like they've gone deep end. wife involved various ""mom/child raising"" groups social media years last watched go typical boring mom conversations screaming giving kids vaccine wrong ""aura"" nursery.

According estimates, 85.9% people 12 years old received least one vaccination, 82.4% fully 80% Covid-19 ICU patients unvaccinated like vast majority hospitalizations coming people unvaccinated. consistent results USA well. can't tell many times I've read ""listen science"" last half year people pushing listen \*scientists\* ignore actual research.

I wrote comment state coronavirus thread yesterday boosters help protect infection WHO, FDA, CDC negative idea. comment currently -4 one responses claims must ""into following science"". got fully vaccinated May Moderna... due health issue, can't get booster probably early 2022... sucks. youngest graduated LAUSD 2020 I'm glad face sending last school year; said, would okay precautions they're taking. I'm still high school's contact list call cases; couple beginning, maybe month ago, that's it. LAUSD done stellar job balancing everything. thoughts.

I wish glowed dark. Sadly, even third shot, don't.

I hope never sees Venus morning. Otherwise Satanified morning star.

Does Satan live Devil's Tower Wyoming? thought lived Lux LA.

These people super big magical thinking. Sure, words meaning, they're fucking incantations. vaccinated care anyone else wears mask vaccine? Luckily, many cases pretty easy spot present red bumps along single nerve path. 
If look body closely shower definitely spot it. 
Rush doctor right away suspicions. 
Well, hope don‚Äôt end nerve path sight. Yeah quickly looked LA county 61%. NE hovering around 70% while, climbing pediatric vaccines. 

It's unfortunate much energy put towards mask mandates instead pushing harder vaccines, biggest impact. Except timing. I'd rather read ""the ERs full"" two weeks Thanksgiving. We'll see. looks like bottomed slowly ticking up. mom got shingles late twenties, said would never wish worst enemy. hope never deal that. downvotes apology? Please please please get vaccinated, get mask up, practice social distancing.

This disagree. move on. Covid going away becoming endemic. Humans social creatures, can't social distance forever.

Vaccination way this. Covid longer deadly everyone immunity, put mess behind us. wonder affects people hunt/eat deer. Guess gotta wear hazmat suits butchering it? Mask compliance La pretty good. general. However vaccination rates may high enough Delta here. fear bad winter surge inevitable. hopefully hospitalizations deaths stay lower last winter. stat bothersome, implies little safer getting vaccine. 

I hoping 10% vs. 90% situation. Hey, thanks mouthbreathers! Generally much better educated people 

That tends effect areas life vaccines commonly used Germany?   Important note viruses actually alive, question mean ask long viral particles remain infectious. lock downs

This case Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Iceland places short, minimal lockdowns initially like Denmark Norway. Even New Zealand's original severe 2020 lockdown lasted 3 weeks. Delta, even severe lockdowns going eliminate COVID timely manner. Countries like Israel much better example handle Delta, heavily vaccinated---with boosters, regular doses--is way out.   Tetanus needs done every 10 years flu shot needs one every year combat whatever strain think coming ear. knowledge wife went Emory Hospitals (over Atlanta we're hour away) I'm exactly sure got connected Pfizer go trial.  Mask mandates silly point. think so? continue wear mask make rest us vaccinated people wear them. vaccine resistant strain comes along, turbo fucked look regionally rather nationally see huge peak south declined. lots areas hit peak kind stayed plateaued good point. Coming another direction, Israel reported steady increase breakthrough infections deaths six months more. evidence resistance infection declined. free vaccine ... works. I've virus December J&amp;J vaccine April, cdc always sends recommendations long covid symptoms immunity boosts. claim based health data I'm protected Delta strain needed booster would update me. doctor said told Covid vaccine like booster. arm even hurt got booster. Felt fine.  Touch√©!  stay manageable. current hospitalisation rates, wave die anything becomes seriously critical. absolutely idea long term effects mRNA vaccine kids

What long term effects COVID-19 infection kids? California they‚Äôre telling people go ahead get booster. original messaging really bad. Pretty sure never ""too late"" get vaccine Shhhh‚Ä¶ make brand name Antivaxermectin it‚Äôll sell like hot cakes.   1. data set includes sick people, group young healthy people worried about. includes chronic myocarditis rather acute. data set cardiac patients pregnant cardiac patients. suck Google. 

2. Myocarditis also risk catching covid. Myocarditis vaccine 2.13 cases per 100,000. Myocarditis Covid patients admitted hospital (so actual number likely greater) .146 patients. Lmk need help maths. 

3. actual studies vaccine induced myocarditis indicate cases overwhelmingly mild short term. largest study patients Doctor Hamdan Israel expect patients problem future 

I‚Äôm youngish male got vaccine I‚Äôm scared baby. censorship Jet fuel want sunbeam  Lol, nothing. anything eased back more. got booster yesterday. feel fine. chilling coffee Reddit. Sure beats ending intubated. acute problem deaths happening right now, rather, excess mortality caused already delayed treatments (eg cancer surgery, organ transplants) deaths result medical system becoming overwhelmed acute cases.

Record high infections would translate record high strain entire medical system. ICUs full. already problem ER post-hospitalization care like rehab at-home nurse visits.

The entire chain much strain, causing medical workers burn out, making even worse.

That's focus deaths, much. worst indicator use policy guidance. like deciding send fire brigade based find burnt-out buildings. money alone, I‚Äôd pay w/o hesitation. 
Still need script though! Since messaging anything beem accurate covid? complete shit show Lol typical Redditor wants argue 50 percent vs 66.  basic statement pertaining certain group individuals.

One believes vaccines lose efficacy. know argue point studies pretty clear. 

Another believes conspiracy booster, original vaccine. Like, they're implanting chips, Linda? Really?

The *only* thing personally help end pandemic prevent getting sick get someone else sick, end hospital myself, patient 0 freaky variant. best way get sick wear mask, cautious, keep immunity high getting booster. risks health getting boosted miniscule. booster dose snatched someone impoverished nation elsewhere; going end American's arm garbage can. 

Just two cents. wonder well could live traveling distance.  I'm convinced like feel superior others.

Ok document right People ages 18‚Äì64 years increased risk COVID-19 exposure transmission occupational institutional setting may get booster shot based individual risks benefits

So sounds much like ""increased risk"" ""high risk"" used synonymously here. ""The ERs packed"" erroneous clickbait statement. areas high vaccination, packed. even close. say general statement journalistic malpractice.

&amp;#x200B;

In areas, yes, ERs ICUs busy. Colorado, example. any/many breakthrough cases? I‚Äôm young fully vaccinated (but without booster yet worry)   That's justified got mine last month. I'm already anxious enough situation, got shot mental health. would mess winter without it.   Don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôm zookeeper concerns animals work with. concerns brushed side brought management. Luckily vets top started safety protocols long afterwards. That's big one, ""overweight"" another big one.

You even obese, overweight 74% Americans. tell people listen CDC FDA, frankly, lot people critical thinking skills distinguish good advice flawed advice, easier tell stick taking advice genuinely reputable source. 

But CDC made mistakes given faulty advice before. slow recommend masks slow recognize outdoors reduced risk transmission. I'm sure many people regret trusting medical establishment's ""Any vaccine good vaccine"" advice got J&amp;J.

I think reasonably intelligent person see CDC recommending boosters everyone sole reason want erode confidence vaccine among hesitant. seems like valid enough reason paper, means nothing us individual level.  Pfizer booster Monday 7 months, mild fatigue night. Sore arm next day less fatigue... felt basically normal 48 hours. First two shots whack 7 9 days. crap shoot mostly. one years dogs left side kids catching covid getting outcomes like myocarditis hospitalizations/ICU buckets. apples apples comparison. approval authorities know they're statistics. Yeah! read that. I'm going tomorrow. relief. Please generalize like that. folks mental illnesses know far responsible average person (at least US). everyone privilege able work home.

The pandemic hit front line workers hardest, including retail/grocery store/food service workers must interface customers day long - - likely full health insurance benefits.

It's privilege able say ""I work home"". somewhere covid cases 0 qualifies increased risk exposure.

Again, CDC say \*increased\* risk. say \*high\* risk.

I know people can't admit CA going CDC recommendations.

And I've said before, probably too. mean can't say governments really need get shit together. scary common become. hospital work age range ICU 29-55. None well. Wow. know could that. I'm seriously going go first thing tomorrow morning. give weekend recover, needed. thought read problem 12 likely dose different.  12 getting adult doses.

We really know time passes though.  That's really that's saying though.

That's ""excess myocarditis"" timeframe study control group, right? point longer timespan greater portion (and likely near 100%) kids catch COVID corresponding rate myocarditis catch COVID. third Moderna shot half dose. seems people experience weaker side effects dose 2. Hopefully true I'm getting third shot weekend.

Even suck day, that's still better getting Covid, IMO. Damn got J&amp;J booster today. mean I‚Äôll feel shitty tomorrow? Okay give shots? mention megaspreader astroworld event, people closely packed together getting crushed death, definitely close enough transmit covid. Money Holiday Economy set priority lives. Also selfishness and/or covid fatigue people like pretend things normal basically have. CVS give anyone it‚Äôs 6 months. thank goodness, I'm sure pronounced reaction longer period immune challenges, allowing germinal centers bcells time develop robust immune response. Immune responses typically feel like crap part, infection that's recognized responded to, fever, aches, glandular swelling, immune responses. know weeks confers less robust response months between, makes sense challenge months later would produce stronger immune response, one people experience negative side effects. imagine full dose either would made literally cry, considering awful felt half dose. think LOT breakthrough cases happening. Four relatives breakthrough cases, one close friend. I'm sorry feeling crappy. wish would open everybody aged ~21-60. want travel, really want without booster since well 6 months since second shot. 

I mean, get lucky long.  Eh, says Adults work reside certain settings (e.g., health care, schools, correctional facilities, homeless shelters) may increased risk exposed COVID-19, could spreading work reside

But least define exact living settings eligible, lists examples claim exhaustive list.

That's raw value. huge part population vaccinated practice pretty close 1 outbreaks quell pretty quickly. that's average, soon reach group close unvaccinated people (neighborhoods low vaccination rates, example) they're hit super fast. started all!

You can't bleed stone.   also so, happy daughter fully vaccinated Christmas I‚Äôm Jewish, lol! Btw people really following numbers, massive jump!

Ok Randy Marsh youngest children 2 million, got first dose today. 6 year old went full wildcat needle aversion 11 year old smiled whole time excited. grateful today! issue though- even those- still change long covid- vaccines cut risk half, full 37%....

That's nearly 20% change issues stay you. That's far high gamble.
/Aigned, someone multiple friends family long COVID- doctors said they'll never again, lung wise health wise- see anything science wise coming help long /permenant covid....

:( **Nope!**. Fast tracked doesn‚Äôt mean short term study. Fast tracked means length studies every vaccine, simply concurrently overlapping timelines, rather sequentially. doesn‚Äôt change validity theresults. Well who's surprised here? still like 30 million people taken vaccine, many part choosing take vaccine. people get mad Pfizer's CEO called antivaxxers ""criminals"".

I'm going repeat again: TAKE F\*\*KING VACCINE PEOPLE! enough stop winter surge.

I think people capacity isolate (WHF, contactless deliveries, etc.) decided risk going clinic vaccination higher could achieve barrier/protocol--especially child otherwise healthy due isolation getting regular seasonal diseases might make office-visit necessary.

I proportion population statistic, fall situation, think most, concerned child COVID related syndromes catch second 2-5Y COVID vaccines available. reasonable data important. need know safe two doses long. need booster - far looks excellent third dose regimen, around 98% protection calculations. might even able finally ditch masks good. lockdowns - blame antivaxxers data reminds family friends get booster.

Background

Domestic pets contract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; however, unknown whether UK B.1.1.7 variant easily infect certain animal species increase possibility human-to-animal transmission.

Methods

This descriptive case series reporting SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant infections group dogs cats suspected myocarditis.

Results

The study describes infection domestic cats dogs B.1.1.7 variant. Two cats one dog positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR rectal swab, two cats one dog found SARS-CoV-2 antibodies 2‚Äì6 weeks developed signs cardiac disease. Many owners pets developed respiratory symptoms 3‚Äì6 weeks pets became ill also tested positive COVID-19. Interestingly, pets referred acute onset cardiac disease, including severe myocardial disorders suspected inflammatory origin without primary respiratory signs.

I‚Äôve putting going dentist even though I‚Äôve vaccinated kept thinking would get better safer keeps getting worse. I‚Äôm immune compromised I‚Äôve careful whole time can‚Äôt keep putting off. Theater, meter, word ends ""‚Äîre"" pronounced way generally changed ""‚Äîer"" agree things kids subjected disgusting different point discussion. think things back normal kids, regardless vaccines not. vaccine years data reflect lot happier get kid vaccinated. major vaccines around decades. Ideally, yes. much pregnant. study also found unvaccinated age groups 45 times likely coronavirus infection fully vaccinated people.

Another interesting finding. I‚Äôm 100% sure imagine would take years reference. kid major vaccines around decades. stop tomorrow someone actually would make decision withhold healthcare unvaccinated, 90% current ICU occupancy Bavaria unvaccinated people. unfortunately going happen anyone wondering, ""2G"" call ""vaccination certificate required places like restaurants"" Germany (it means ""**g**eimpft oder **g**enesen"", translates ""vaccinated recovered \[from covid\]""). There's also 3G means ""geimpft, genesen oder getestet"", recent negative covid test used instead vaccination certificate. refer 3G ""geimpft, genesen oder gestorben"" (vaccinated, recovered dead) though. That's happened several European countries summer, though. Denmark little restrictions, infections still kept going down. also really understand time. gotten colder, infections surging. depressing. 

So NSW (which, btw, hopefully next year PM let back in), would little concerned Sourthern Hemisphere winter. stats wanted know looked up, 84m pop, 57m first doses, 55m second doses, 40m+ BionTech Pfizer vaccine. 

Travel status: 
In principle, entry possible from:

EU member states

states associated Schengen: Iceland, Norway, Switzerland Liechtenstein

other countries entry possible light epidemiological situation assessment EU.


Would interesting know vaccination stats amongst hospitalized. Yeah, got TDAP booster 6 months ago, I‚Äôm set another 10 years. probably check MMR since I‚Äôm mid 30s  think different study. Waste water possibly?  topic, tell lose minds around highways? Always trying cross right front car. rut year round problem around here. go war killed 3000 people. went war threatened stability world economy terrorizing billions people.

COVID also threatened stability world economy, extreme measures also taken. threat passed.

Dollars value, human lives. Ahh, seems 100% possible. Thanks.  Say population 200, half vaccinated. Every time someone unvaccinated group gets covid recovers, likely decent protection infection while.

So math calculate now, compare rate infections 100 vaccinated 100 unvaccinated. 100 unvaccinated, 25 natural immunity, they're protected least somewhat. Whereas vaccine trials, 98 natural immunity. looks like vaccines got worse, actually happened unvaccinated group got less likely infected.  Question. Would matter also look areas states? California 2.9 times larger Florida. we‚Äôre going calculate ""per capita""‚Äîshould based population, area?

And calculating population AGE determine that's factor?

Or ‚Äúper capita‚Äù pretty much trump additional statistics.    again, government weeks late comes act. Instead, criticize Austria strict rules unvaccinated persons let numbers sky-rocket here. 16.000 ... around 19.000 tommorow. Instead acting on-the-fly, choose discuss week ... experts tell government shutdown 2 weeks act fast (weeks ago) nope.  county never even decline. plateaued around 400 cases/day. kept waiting numbers go like parts country never did... things starting trend back up. get it. vaccination rate even little higher national rate. Hopefully long. effectiveness vaccines declining, ""control"" group getting smaller. determine effectiveness, compare infection rates vaccinated people unvaccinated people. increase proportion unvaccinated people least short-term protection due natural infection, rate infection among unvaccinated declines. result rate infection among vaccinated look impressive comparison. BatsMans ? It‚Äôs one reasons I‚Äôm getting today I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm alone lol.  I‚Äôm starting think next ‚Äúx‚Äù amount years we‚Äôre going huge strain hospitals point burnout medical professionals unvaccinated ever slowly weed gene pool. course taking good amount high risk individuals even though they‚Äôre vaccinated vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% they‚Äôre high risk

Like, I‚Äôve last person go ‚Äújust die already‚Äù unvaccinated I‚Äôm starting get there. incredibly tiring. sane part society part deserves able move forward without dead weight that‚Äôs actively trying bring us Yes, Shingrix current one. replaced old live-virus Zostavax.

I've asked two doctor friends get 50. One said problem said unlikely. I'm definitely asking primary care doc next checkup though.

If I'm camping outside Walgreens night 50th.  Ah yes nugent method Oh yeah, took one day off, to.

Some people pretty bad times boosters, predictable, people seem side effects first doses. literally fight get 12 month old measles vaccine - fact vaccines. doctor said ""oh well, important, seeing anyone person anyway."" Walk ins, children's hospital backed months doctors see pediatric patients. Thanks much. I‚Äôve got under-2 home wish they‚Äôd hurry submissions approvals Earth Classic: Season Mastery unvaccinated don‚Äôt want lockdown anymore get jab; tired freeloaders pulling weight. 

/rant. absurd even consider. hard time getting 50% humans vaccinated. seems moot worry deer, much less thousands wild animals human contact. Especially considering known year animals carry virus known year reinfections happen people antibodies. 
With without deer involved, thing always going here. Getting people vaccinated don‚Äôt clog hospitals get sick need do. useless banter otherwise. Measles coming back big reason everyone respect anti-vaxxers responsible good amounts original resurgence especially developed nations. Anti-vaxxers selfish people. Yes I'm uk first thought also I‚Äôm Northeast well, upper North, rural hospitals full particular cities mask mandates, even though governor refuses one matter many people dying.  Lol Luciferacist new one ‚Äúshingrix ‚Äú? 
If so, I‚Äôd like get. 
That said, ways go hit 50‚Ä¶ :(  OG Pfizer person, Moderna bit better antibody counts Pfizer small mix match study, although study full dose reason Moderna applied authorized half dose booster. data yet dose reduction means efficacy probably big deal. Maybe squeaks back little Pfizer, knows, either way neither option bad choice. Also antibody counts thing work immune system.

I team Pfizer first 2, decided get booster Pfizer data came showing Pfizer-boosted-Pfizer 95% efficacy (real world data, petri dish antibodies) compared unboosted Pfizer. bears repeating 95% typical comparison unvaxxed-to-triple-Pfizered, 95% comparing 2-dose 3-dose Pfizering. That's huge!! Also knew body responded without side effects first two Pfizers comfortable tripling seeing I'd get hit Moderna bus like lot friends family did. big deal, personal preference me.

TLDR mRNAs incredible data boosters. holidays coming, gross people trying spread covid going spread people tried careful trying celebrate holidays. It‚Äôs going get bad again. I've never heard conspiracy nut say 9/11 real. inside job something. Lots say Sandy Hook real, sick freaks.  3rd Pfizer single side effect. Yep lunatics think Covid isn‚Äôt real. earth flat ever depends individual assessment risk, risk factors. That's coming to. lieu public policy mutually agreed upon tolerated, localized rulesets, perhaps importantly, general patterns behavior.

I've never understood need say ""this over!"" ""this me!""

These statements absurd, coping mechanisms. Personally, I'm going get booster next peak holiday season. I'm going paired holiday season, I'm going see close family. cases rise locally common seen positivity caserate, I'm going cautious indoors. things better, I'll modify behaviors. I'll keep rolling punches risk increasing decreasing. 4 month old 4 year old, risk assessment would different. immunocompromised, old, would different. Oh 100%. They‚Äôve invaded school board meetings. violent threats posted online investigated FBI. school board superintendent lot pressure Yes that‚Äôs put quote comments. It‚Äôs Colorado. guess correlation education rather income Gottleib's reply Topol going full red alert alarm trends going wrong direction:

""What's happening right Delta wave moved populated states south, like Texas Florida, less populated states mountains, plains, spreading quickly populated states Great Lakes Region, New England. want stress, closer end Delta wave beginning. tragically, looks like done us yet.""

People giving hell comments saying wave towards end Thanksgiving, people going full MASSIVE WINTER WAVE COMING. Gottleib response saying ""the waves Israel UK driven back massive booster shot program. That's need put focus right now."" ERs packed

Entirely depends are. usual places higher vaccination rates usually better. think we‚Äôre underestimating effects anti vaxx parent groups having. people come packs school board meetings protest mask usage, etc stress could see districts would try ease hopefully shut up. anyone bit chemistry knowledge know, Luciferase would enzyme breaks Luciferose. 

Holy shit stupid. never ideas like even LSD. Anecdotally, Atlanta there‚Äôs huge increase ambulance sirens past week. story assumes deer, would able eradicate Covid humans, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs ever going case. many places world without access vaccines many people places vaccines refuse get them. think going get Covid shot every year hope get it, shot protects serious illness. meantime that‚Äôs one reason go hunting, needed one! Yes, plateau, transition summer peak fades South winter peak starts build North. I'd expect cases double January, especially holiday travel. Latest 2-4 end year data submission, believe changed. *If* submit data FDA end year gets authorization, would expect - given timelines EUA - shots start going arms mid-February. Bummer, unlucky. Flu levels season still lower expected... now, things could get much worse quickly. Feel better soon.

I try get flu shot end October latest, always remember time. Large groups unmasked poorly ventilated filter indoors also vaccinated keep COVID going years well needless deaths suffering.

Mask up, ventilate filter air indoors, get vaccinated. path endemic COVID. covid last month 3 4 family members got covid symptoms.
We vaccinated.  US? new generation shingles vaccine approved 50 old one longer used.  even might known someone died either justify warped way(old, obese etc) think lied unfortunately. 

Yes, love logic, Grandpa died pneumonia old cancer, wasn‚Äôt Covid. 

But Grandpa heart attack 2 weeks getting vaccine, well, obviously vaccine killed him. sudden, risk factors go right window don‚Äôt matter anymore.  Waiting someone family go ""they wanna cancel conservatives!"" 
lol cases fairly flat, deaths, ICU filling again.

We really need vaccines, plus masks ventilation indoors.   effective Delta, R0 Delta high enough 60% population vaccinated, still enough unvaccinated people suggest amongst freely, likely create breakthrough cases. So, maybe answer this. humans transmitting virus deer? 

I see would go way, hunter interacts dying deer shot. 

But don‚Äôt get happens way.  today, I'm really expecting anything different second dose. reminds I'm overdue physical. I'll bring up.

Sounds like nothing value lost. Yeah deer watch fox News might easier  Yeah I‚Äôm get talk lot WFH staff regularly coming office located one running manufacturing plants. WFH options mandatory quarantine daughter either Covid enforced quarantine school. There‚Äôs definite undercurrent feeling staff keep plants running this. Im copy pasting old comment:

Firstly, incredibly hard someone fell conspiracy trap/cult think get again. lenghty process avoid overwhelm person facts, often stonewall you. conspiracy think comes unable differentiate credible sources aunt karens facebook posts. comes emotional place e.g. fear. Heres info lot fact check websites there, find many ""alternative news sources"" getting debunked, impossible discredit invent new ones every Yes, let's build beds instead simpler cheaper measures like mask vaccine mandates, also helps people getting sick first place. husband came breakthrough case. changed staff meeting person, indoors, masks. wore mask, person so. waiting test results, also pressured come back work. Then, tried deny sick pay full year yet.  has, like... nothing explanation reproduction rates. may right. I‚Äôm Wfh though I‚Äôm risking anything work lunch.

Fuck that‚Äôs got. source this? decline Delta wave coinciding rise seasonal wave resulting flatline.   wonder could start giving priority vulnerable people tests could get pills asap  dropped local school mask requirements based current low infection rate. I‚Äôm sure feel that. I‚Äôm glad kids vaccinated least. Y‚Äôall stay safe. small country. Much easier handle. Vaguely glad young got it.

There‚Äôs still chance might drop dead randomly moment, bright side.  100% true. son May 202 ended missing one set shots Dr. Office kept canceling appointment.

That‚Äôs terrible. live California, school masks lots precautions regular testing pretty decent communication felt safe send kids in. school tiny number cases far. saw coming getting J&amp;J March got full course Pfizer summer. relieved. variation article people keep asking deer could get infected. They're live. back yard 6 view. transmissible variants walk outside cough deer infected. Oh that's start tbh

My neighbour deaf. Why? Measles. low incidence rate, 1 1000. statistics care individual. Indeed. also included vaccinated people group people taking precautions. Even let guard times mask usage. Go get booster y'all! waited regret got mine yesterday (: fallen NYS, last several weeks spiked again. Especially locally (Capital Region). We're in-step time last year terms case rates hospitalizations. family part plateau count. Husband breakthrough case week (2nd pfizer dose March). Moderna - 2nd dose April - seems holding up. symptoms test came back negative.

We technically eligible boosters 40 underlying conditions. Looking back, definitely going exposed point places dropped mask mandates near us gotten boosters. soon clear, I'm booking appointments. What‚Äôs latest science exposure acting boost? hybrid immunity recently multiple kids get covid, exposure caring constant. tested negative multiple times symptoms. 

Does exposure like anything immunity? even know yet? people thought Michael Scott run rabies BAD idea. Smh amount anti-vax efforts make come back, luckily

Carelessness remains emerging Russia pretty much possible vector, outside hideous lab accident.  Yeah, dad like that. funny though, soon showing covid symptoms immediately tried best could distance me. Like, thought flu, dad.. ironic. Oh sorry, talking Eastern Europe.

Sometimes blank contact information forms lying table, nobody asks for. even know best way combat misinformation more. guy know talking doctor heard radio pissed insisted nurse giving shot pull needle re-position make sure could draw blood needle inject artery make sure vaccine ""hit heart full strength"" would kill him. looked instructions administering vaccine CDC's site publicly available. say shot given intramuscular, intravenous. sites talk pros/cons either way shot supposed intravenous guarantee would ""hit heart full strength"" (no clue means). guy friend angry nurse grasp even know combat type crap. Giving information linking solid sources (like CDC's guide administering Moderna) valid apparently rando radio calling doctor knows better guess? frustrating. anyone else following Dr John Campbell since beginning Pandemic? noticed shift videos past months? feel like falling anti-vax rabbit hole, odd considering much proponent them. partially wonder youtube success subsequent audience changed him.   time Thanksgiving Christmas! üòÑ  third dose pfizer increase protection symptomatic infection hospitalisation? still exists though  like pulling plug sticking back hoping lose unsaved work. even choose picture/thumbnail.

Ah shit, who's fucking deer? honestly understand logic 2g rules long people categories (vaccinated recovered) still able contract spread covid. see practical benefit 2g, pressure unvaccinated get vaccinated threatening ban much public life. might worked summer, ship sailed already? point, numbers are, take comfort dining indoors restaurant everyone vaccinated recovered without tested. missing something here? mean therapeutics released think mark change react covid. pure speculation idk wed need keep take pill make feel better. chicken pox steroids shows later. Ticking time bomb pain No, outdoor events super spreader events. full capacity unmasked outdoor college games resulted super spreader events. latest data shows indoor events dangerous ones. Everyone: Please please **please** get vaccinated, get boostered, mask up, practice social distancing. important right now! protecting ourselves, protecting neighbors well &lt;3 authorized yet? dont feel bad paid it... like short supply... want it. feeling WFH folks deal daily risk. deal reports office due covid exposure. 

In general felt less fear danger, along time factor. WFH folks kinda done it.

Me still office. Still people go quarantine. 

Yeah think I'll skip lunch offer.

Anybody dread office conversations WFH folks return 2022?

I assume I'll bite tongue upper level exec. tells rough home. Yeah, it‚Äôs hard say. think it‚Äôs gamble every time gets passed around. takes one mutation right kind poison overthrow others. silver lining delta infectious, vaccine evading strains didn‚Äôt fighting chance.

But ability mutate unvaccinated immunocompromised people. time could time ramps up. it‚Äôs better suffocate never give jt chance. 

My confusion is, could get infectious evasive time? always see comments saying virus like would burn quick, wonder could still happen.  Great username. Anyway, government arguing (literally, moment various ministers arguing additional Covid measures) 2G access requirements things like restaurants theatres would 'drive wedge vaccinated unvaccinated'. 

Well yes *DUH* that's exactly want. Get plague ridden aholes packed spaces ASAP. I'm eligible booster :(  Dude, go pedantic elsewhere. think things get hairy winter (they likely will) they'll change definition fully vaxxed Same! tried rough calculations. Around 45% cases breakthrough. Given vaccination rate MA, implied vaccine efficacy 67%. said, may lowered bit 10% people got 1 dose (although suspect fake, aka boosters) previously infected.    downvotes?  6 year old got week. symptoms. mom also got covid booster flu shot there.

Wildlife contact contaminated water sources also suggested potential transmission route (11), although transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 wastewater yet conclusively demonstrated (25). Transmission fomites infected animal species cannot discounted.*

Captive cervids captive deer. Captive deer potentially spreading wild ones. Wildlife rehabilitation would like, facilities treating releasing injured deer.

Strongly recommending certain groups get booster makes sense (including got J&amp;J 2+ months ago). leave ""may"" category everyone second mRNA dose 6 months ago. 

Their current guidelines cover many people think really preventing scheduling/supply problems rationale. Boosters gonna yearly thing minimum right now. current vaccines aren‚Äôt gonna slow enough unfortunately feel. it‚Äôs got right Actually, that's exactly works. 2020, vaccines lower risk profiles nearly everyone manageable levels. people decide risk low enough resume life, that's over. 

The social end pandemic coming much faster epidemiological end, whether CDC wringing hands cases not. many places like NE, already here.

The US isn‚Äôt serious country anymore. Whoa, seems little worse US state peak, per capita. think cases high? think cases evenly spread throughout croatia certain areas? mine basically way door hospital haha.

(Neither I've done enough research opinion either way, anti-vax genre material) someone immunocompromised small child home area high transmission, hate it. job done easily home, want micromanage Ooooh, new vaccine technology!

Though, think it, unfortunate humanity needs pandemic put money good causes, like improving health protection technologis delta, almost certainly not. something future, it‚Äôs possible (they it, there‚Äôs reason juncture). see lot people hesitantly reluctantly got original vaccines going boosters. messaging vaccines don‚Äôt work (so would booster work?) even get you‚Äôre still allowed go back normal anyway. 

Now isn‚Äôt personal opinion it‚Äôs getting hard refute that. see lies here. hospital then? need prioritize boosters vaccinated people.

I wish people would simply lie former smokers. Sounds like plan! You‚Äôll fine. Nice! writing wall point. want vaccines effective reducing rate symptomatic covid, everyone needs get booster.

It interesting see efficacy symptomatic infection looks like 6 months booster shot. It‚Äôs really hard understand. Americans believe lives worth others. Prove wrong. Lmao - recently got ""art"" espresso first got machine, got little post-happy shared lot cups experiences.

Yuppp - saw coming. backlog things could put come due, Covid still raging. last shot April asked vaccination clinic college last week could get booster. dice :( CDC's list. mood disorders, including depression, schizophrenia spectrum disorders make likely¬†to get severely ill COVID-19. Literally everyone know got breakthrough infection teacher parent young children. worked school, I'd get booster yesterday. Anecdotally, husband really, really well. low fever 24 hours congestion. family, spent entire 48 hours prior start symptoms together close contact kids (12 year old vaccinated, 9 year old first shot, 11 month old still nursing). 

So far (fingers crossed), none rest us symptoms day 6. Waiting get pcr test results back. think vaccines definitely helped lessen husband's symptoms probably lowered likelihood passing rest us.

I'd complete panic vaccinated. definitely this. bunch people vaccinated, need get boosters. JnJ 100% get booster. Unless bmi less 25, work home, never go grocery store, zero medical issues (including mental health ones)

This me. still got booster last week, said, one asks. CVS. yeah we're trending back up. would doubt different adults.  Dave Blake:

Also alot intelligent. resources people want COVID vaccine gotten huge fear needles? think really work way. Cases, hospitalizations, deaths going nonzero foreseeable future, even severely mitigated vaccination, treatments, and/or natural immunity. eventually (and maybe soon) become question arbitrary number cases/hospitalizations/deaths people deem acceptable. That‚Äôs reality endemic disease. long last shot Pfizer Moderna 6 months ago likely get booster. many qualifying conditions. wasn‚Äôt even asked it. got J&amp;J least 2 months ago, get booster now! chance vaccines tweaked work better Delta?  What's paxlovid? Excuse frustration. Federal contractor fully vaccinated mixed booster. people sue federal facilities, put hold mandate president people vaccinated follow rules say options? asking 3 months work home amount idiots work getting sick following rules (vaccine, wearing masks etc).

No. 

I stopped looking US one country long time ago comes covid. states people different. many different people approaches governments. places US covid never existed... least people never believed existed anyway. high case/death counts per capita. 

And places taken seriously teh beginning. Much lower case/death rates. 

Judging US whole pointless. GOOD JOB!!!GOOD RESEARCH!!! people like us keeping track things applying happened past influence future decisions gonna make it. seriousness, good jobüëç Along improving ventilation air filtration buildings.  Australia lock-out instead lockdown. 
Vaccinated people go everywhere masks unvaccinated people leave house approved reasons. really, even countries extremely high vaccination rates Europe seeing case numbers flying hospitalisations deaths steadily rising point J&amp;J main pro, one shot, completely diminished two months. Yup-We forced abide capacity limits (not US countries), constant mental stress knowing things get shut etc despite taking sensible precautions. always number 1 complaint since early 2021-Why vaccinated folks forced restrict lives?

Ive accepted way world move Nothing done. best answer right here. Coronavirus antibodies wane time. true COVID19 also true four main ""Common Cold"" coronaviruses. common cold viruses still circulate even though almost everyone kind memory immunity. Hence common colds usually mild. takes day two immune system kick produce correct antibodies. Especially last ~2 years, I‚Äôm honest, especially past ~6 years. True  even worse seems. ""proof"" cited video showing someone opening Moderna patent, searching ""luciferase"", finding 1x patent. problem? 1x title reference paper. Aka citation. part patent all. adults getting boosters. qualifications 6 months primary shots. Even though almost 9 10 adults qualify liberal reading CDC guidelines, many think eligible. needs stop. CDC amend guidelines make everyone eligible worry anti-vax people think.  Agreed. somewhat depressed. Everyone life least once.  used excuse nation build start two wars already wanted in. Also good point! former smoker, CVS doesn‚Äôt know that. Neither online scheduling person gave shot asked anything eligibility. checking ID make sure I‚Äôm one made appointment.

Edit: slight correction, second shot hadn‚Äôt 6 months ago, wouldn‚Äôt let schedule. don‚Äôt think anyone lie part.  survival rate way you‚Äôd spend whole life waiting ‚Äújust die already‚Äù petty say, drastic misunderstanding situation. likely lasting effects however maybe change peoples perspective. one Moderna breakthrough cases. three days mild misery week lost smell. Weirdly enough, month later got head cold knocked ass harder COVID did. 

The vaccine awesome, man. Well, grandmother get bed hospital stroke, would nice medical system overwhelmed covidiots take simple preventative measures avoid put ventilator.  Probably much, UK's data evidences that, similar greater situation terms natural immunity US. 

Their data waning divides efficacy Clinically Vulnerable non-clinically vulnerable even 65+ Pfizer efficacy hospitalisation still 94.6% non-vulnerable group 20+ weeks. data also seems use fairly date controls consider delta hpspitalisations. natural immunity reducing efficacy, percent. Yeah agree really unfortunate, great source trusted information way back first started Wuhan. also gave Ivermectin thought early on, seen data coming saying otherwise. last one watched bothered interviewed guy got pericarditis vaccine. Like yes that's rare serious side effect that's acknowledged, good bringing someone talk scaring people? odds unvaccinated getting serious side effect covid astronomically higher adverse effects vaccines. story plays everywhere.

Get decent level eligible people vaccinate percentage looks nice high (85% vaccinated!!! ^of ^eligible).

Reduce end restrictions.

On Saturday received Moderna booster. rough time second dose (fever 3-4 days), expecting much booster. Started developing fever Saturday night 8 hours booster. also developed **very** sore throat exact time. swallowing much mucus assumed that. Fever sore throat went away Monday night, developed swollen lymph nodes arm pit (injection arm) painful. Tuesday morning developed constant tickle throat led dry cough. 


Tickle lymph node better, still there. limited interaction anyone days leading booster. ton Binax home tests client mine pharmacist gave many months ago (he knew pretty much recluse pandemic). taken one everyday since Saturday negative. 


I know home tests aren‚Äôt 100%, still seems odd 6 tests nothing. Covid cold? booster shot shoot cause something? Seems odd started right booster fever did. Mar 2020: Test trace allow us keep COVID control. Rapid testing kits rushed, Google Apple etc working tracing apps! Let's go people!

May 2020: Privacy issues, state laws, hard, let's give wait vax... really dont get conclusion.

All common vaccines spacing shots often shots well. Even MPR 4 years shots.

The vaccines covid what, 3-8 weeks shots? I'm guessing boosters 2 times year foreseeable future. big deal. 15 minutes time 2 times per year help keep healthy contribute community spread. brainer. wish saw way. That's got mine. issues. vaccination schedule had, moderna absolutely hit like train wreck, never ever vaccine side effects that. Even insurance pay it, Costco lists $180, well worth it.

It clarify whether that's total per dose. Probably total. myocarditis. article talking access dropping pandemic, anti vax sentiment grown U.S. recent generations people grew success measles vaccination programs start believe they‚Äôre unnecessary gets made worse active efforts demonize grifters, like vaccines cause autism nonsense. issue this, let's say kid *is* injured one car accidents way school. I, personally, would love hospital take overwhelmed covid patients. would like nurses doctors exhausted *years* overwork due covid can't provide quality care. heard friend (lying, antivaxx) nurse Staten Island told hospitals packed full of... vaccinated people.

And, seen populate ""vaccine dangerous"". even close. Seriously. vaccine incredibly safe incredibly effective virus dangerous. difference orders magnitude.

You wrong overly afraid myocarditis. It‚Äôs usually treated ibuprofen home. 

.0022 people died getting vaccine vaccine. Overall TTS caused 5 deaths United States. Covid killed hundreds thousands still losing thousand day. 

Stop living fear. Stop spreading fear misinformation. That's great, bad took 281 deaths per 100k people get there. Fun fact: Dutch match stick called ""lucifer"". wife 60&amp;65. got vaxxed 6 months ago. work house. real public indoor activities dining &amp; grocery shopping. get boost?

Hey, nice!

I'd say matter all, yet, long getting mRNA booster. getting booster current vaccine prevent getting something else later.   right; mistakenly looking New York City's graph.

Well, 3, work tremendously well keeping people alive hospital. live NYC we're pretty well right vaccinations 75%+ every borough adults. working, latest spike saw WAY less hospitalizations deaths.

The sad reality covid hotspot thing, concentrated unvaxxed areas, forever. personal choice vs. macro event. wonder caused this. fact like 40 percent anti vax science deniers? fact de facto government currently? minister health bullshit blabbering know all? maybe country keeps pushing responsibility mandating quarantine required vaccination states wait federal government mandate follow. shitshow.  hate break you, know numerous people PhDs hard sciences believe real bullshit.

Number downward trend booster programme picking up. Probably 80% kids covid. That's good news. planning getting third moderna booster next couple hours. I‚Äôm 22 year old male scares bit. get Pfizer instead? stays hotels, tears walls Masks really bad stop thinking it. wear one 48 hours week, rest job sucks much forget mask.
But add proper surgical mask lot easier breath cloth one sucks mouth time take breath. Please lump kid dumb asses. One group delayed waiting science group stupid. People give f*** covid anymore sure downvote. It‚Äôs asking blood clot groups get 74% effective real world coincides clinical trials that‚Äôs delta, 94% achieved two dose trial holds true (which based should) really isn‚Äôt need mRNA anyway.

The J&amp;J‚Äôs slow burn creates better B cell response due slow burn, mRNA ones don‚Äôt effectively. antibodies boost sterilizing immunity, isn‚Äôt consensus threshold even is. Since adding mRNA J&amp;J doesn‚Äôt seem much B cell immunity based tests fo far it‚Äôs really potential sterilizing immunity isn‚Äôt really enough suggest two doses enough antibodies. crazy. R0 (expected number cases directly generated 1 infected person) measles 12-18 whereas Delta variant's R0 6-7.

Yes, read, room someone measles, consider infected. Politians dont seem understand virus doesnt care. takes every opportunity gets. doesnt compromise.
Politicians wait. think way better lobbyst groups, survery polls. let time pass milder measures wouldve enough. promise things cant keep, virus shows like other.

Michael Meyer-Hermann, immunologist, talking talkshow scientific policy advice government gets. talkes every politician agreed advises scientists gave. next morning nevertheless decided exact opposite, shocked greatly.

I think said somewhere video Corona: Reagiert die Regierung richtig auf das Virus?| Markus Lanz vom 29. April 2021 Good numbers. Need get boosters rolling fast. kids vaccinated asap.  live viewing scientists gas chromatography checking certain ingredients prove present?

This would convince exactly zero people needs to. Ill keep taking offered every jab left feeling pretty shit 48 hours Yeah: may choose COVID-19 vaccine receive booster shot. people may preference vaccine type originally received, others may prefer get different booster. CDC‚Äôs recommendations allow type mix match dosing booster shots. What's latest mixing mrna vaccines booster? Better keep got switch one (i.e., Pfizer/Pfizer/Moderna)? tried google, I've seen recommendations mixing also report Israeli data saying triple Pfizer extremely effective.  Take look northern vs southern states. whole us much big understand trends. Reality regions falling others increasing. someone household goes school, work, social activities, etc, risk actually equal theirs

I actually think this, really want booster. partner works grocery store! Get boosters, nobody cares you‚Äôre ‚Äúeligible‚Äù not. pandemic switched blue urban areas red rural areas areas low vax rates.

naturally. virus going follow path least resistance, pun partially intended. real. going infect unvaccinated much hire rate. red areas, well..... 61% total population. Eligibility opened 5+ needs taken consideration. 12+ 72% vaccinated. 64+ 85% vaccinated. - [Source](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/vaccine/vaccine-dashboard.htm) TL;DR ‚Äúmaybe early next year, possibly quarter 1, can‚Äôt sure‚Äù Topol gone deep end  shortage healthcare workers still burned sick asking people show constraint please stop spreading disease. Regretfully populist politicians ignore pleas help make political game situation helps nobody all. 

Lets get pandemic control first talk improve healthcare system future.  DTaP instead antigens, complete (albeit attenuated) viruses.

Well, DTaP vaccination deseases caused bacteria, specfic, least Tetanus, poison produced bacteria. viral material it.  highly vaccinated countries. good. correct, course, saying US needs prioritize boosters immunity wanes 6 months so. wonder percentage vaccinated folks qualify boosters.

The thing puzzles me, though, people think boosters go get them. seem shortage US. go one's 6 months get one? check make sure date vaccines routine healthcare stay well ER, possible.
 
I think that's depriving anyone unvaxxed point. 22 year old male I‚Äôm happy got Moderna didn‚Äôt get terrible side affects. start wanted Moderna lots others wanted Pfizer, since saw Moderna 100mcg instead 30?mcg Pfizer. 

Holding getting booster beginning December I‚Äôm fully protected potential winter surge Christmas January. Hopefully adverse reaction  NPIs? influenza, there's ""too late."" walk June looking one almost surely get punted following season next one.

[And check Catch-up Immunization schedule see quite instances delays earlier doses result fewer doses total.

Pneumococcal conjugate 4 dose regimen started infant, 1 dose regimen first dose 24 months.

And that's one dosages reduced delayed. definitely could see parent would relay onto reddit post ""too late"" ""just went next set."" masks forever??

Pass. I‚Äôm thinking rest society self-assessment risk. Unless country plans isolating indefinitely, prepare massive wave cases point.  care? Live life let live theirs.  People received THREE, yes three shots vaccine. point stop hygiene theatrics let people make choices?? made decision use tumbler water bottle. Best decision life.   German.

When praise us Covid response? remember people frustrated since, like, March 2020 got Moderna booster today. also shots one two. far, arm sore. 

The first shot knocked 5 days, though. Fever, chills, major fatigue generally feeling like hell. Second shot...not thing. I'm hoping booster dose similar. study‚Äôs authors strongly caution results show people common cold protected COVID-19. authors also acknowledge findings many caveats, meaning it‚Äôs early say certainty people stop infection tracks.  say that. says case count declining due last weeks restrictions. say much last. taken said **the company seen cases myocarditis received booster shot**, half dosage primary series shots. said company continue monitor cases   I'd agree, except one small problem: Rural areas number hospitals support number people need care - get sent cities, across state borders. problem problem, problem theirs. area high full vaccination rate, hospitals 91% capacity; mask mandates social settings still apply, cannot afford take care people flown areas, local residents may require care.  due simple variations samples. nature science continue collecting data revising understanding form consensus around understand ground truth.

No single study 100% reflective truth, rather another piece information points truth. probably something viral loads fact antibodies circulating sterilizing Immunity rely body takes days ramp up. There‚Äôs probably window depending fast body ramps up. would explain seemingly high incidence mild symptoms positive tests, breakthroughs usually severe. 

I think probably becomes issue weakened immune systems, since you‚Äôd need antibodies immune response would less.

All current data suggests J&amp;J followed Moderna really probably best. obviously mRNA heart inflammation vs. J&amp;J blood clots really needs applied appropriate demographics groups deciding that. 

The number double J&amp;Js isn‚Äôt going large since fewer got it, everyone get boosters even would 2. It‚Äôs gonna come people like SVT PEG allergies mRNA. Unless countries receiving large quantities deploying it, like provinces CA, it‚Äôs mostly reach hard reach groups.  Lmao even article? ü§¶ hospitalization death? second Moderna dose day I'm kind hoping get Pfizer booster. Even reading positive story. Yeah, they‚Äôre *everywhere* United States. Plenty large-ish cities middle country you‚Äôll still see deer people‚Äôs yards. Ok Russia, keep completely transparent always. /S wanted read lol. get typical sickness Moderna run (a bit dizzy wheezy first fine half hour) holy shit atrocious headaches months. hoping got booster I'd get pfizer fine :/ this, doubt, due people unwilling get vaccinated likely participating many high-risk activities sensible peers.

But‚Äîwith effect size large‚Äîit's abundantly clear need everyone get vaccinated ASAP.  real science always comments üôè guess need booster too, even tho got moderna b/c I‚Äôm technically overweight. Neat

Are 50? says *can* booster, you‚Äôre 50+ says *should* get booster. frustrating thing me, appears plan ready situation. Dutch government appears taken suprise making new plans situation getting control second time.

Thanks kind words. home making best it. Organised indoor St. Maarten today. AFAIK, there's transmission deer humans, large Covid reserve like white tail deer pretty alarming because, like said, they're literally everywhere point considered nuisance areas.

I thought article said genetic sequences identified strains?

I think native think infect can't infect us... Viral shedding genetic viral material discriminate.

I think *much* wide spread regarding transmission mammal-to-mammal considering virus basically airborne (studies Italy identified virus pollution particles). well good, reality expecting vaccinated people continue putting NPIs indefinitely simply unrealistic whatever reason large share officials get people comply responsible following rules nearly two years point.

We need shift away generalized risk assessment allowing people autonomy determining tolerance. 
The whole op-ed bad faith concern trolling, easy science since hard certain anything. cap **Even gain ultimately obtained boosting, outweigh benefits providing initial protection unvaccinated.** vaccines deployed would good, could hasten end pandemic inhibiting evolution variants. **Indeed, called moratorium boosting benefits primary vaccination made available people around  they're also saying they're following CDC guidance they're clearly not. give perspective.

Base rate myocarditis males 16-19 1/100k.

Covid-19 case-fatality rate *all* children 5/100k. Never life threatening yet get hospitalized tf plunge last year due mass vaccinations. Vaccinations stalled, seems like bad steady state endemic phase continue get herd immunity due natural infections (assuming natural immunity lasts).  Think part problem can't really compare risk myocarditis uninfected individual vaccinated individual.

You compare risk myocarditis upon infection vaccinated individual, since vaccinated seems highly likely catch COVID point anyway  Vaccines mostly provide protection hospitalization death, infection 
 
Against Delta variant, mRNA vaccines low 39% effective infection 
   Despite weather dark early. pitch black 5 pm Germany.  new policy, imagine might take bit time get systems.

CA control FDA/CDC guidelines unfortunately, agencies stop stupid, yeah recommending people ignore guidelines seems like way go. Yeah pattern last year. North gets hit autumn early winter, south gets hit longer summers early fall. MyTurn site likely updated within days. I'm sorry hear that.  Neener-neener. üòù  Came say thing‚Ä¶ Wonderful conspiracy theories strike time future.... Wonderful.  place much importance number infections. Hospitalizations deaths matter.  seeing many people celebrating carnaval like nothing's wrong actually baffling. hell, not, im surprised anymore seeing dutch government also population handled pandemic, still disappointing. frustrating know smaller regulations (and actual enforcement once!) wouldnt talking strict measures lockdowns right now. government always waits long, people always find way push boundaries limits 'het moet wel gezellig blijven!'

i hope wife okay, she'll feel better soon. cant imagine easy quarantine kids situation like this. sure op-ed is, true, wow abdication responsibility. realize FDA reported WHO.

And WHO's shown staggering incompetence many ways, including one. Maybe put energy getting COVAX work right instead telling countries sacrifice citizens make incompetence.  CDC/FDA need stop games give go ahead. Even MA, mind anecdotal stranger internet, PCP told believes everyone grab booster. demonic. Anyone bother read article? one key point hospital mentioned article clearly states - capacity deal it. Also mentions addition covid issues common time year..... Thank this. thread making feel reckless okay unmasking around others fully vaccinated/boosted person. Glad I‚Äôm alone. maybe announced grander fashion media travel hospitals add something tangible, people might care more. Otherwise, it‚Äôs nothingburger people fades background depleted medical workers deal shadows. shit stop presses type information. How?

Its already rarely checked vaccinated. good lockdown good paper? strong doubts implemented meaningful way reality. based trust?

Owners restaurants follow mandates exemplary feel already conned competitor across streets faces consequences violating everything.
I know, lockdowns past mostly depending trust aswell clientele changed people mostly dont care.   bad. hospitals south already reached code black, arent able take patients. really doesnt help theres lot cutbacks healthcare decade, way fewer icu beds available countries europe, makes situation even fragile, despite fact netherlands already known letting people icu easily - dont think decent chance survival good quality life, chances dont get bed. hospitalizations might compared vaccines available, things keep going like measures, we're going real trouble. Oh guess need booster too, even tho got moderna b/c I‚Äôm technically overweight. Neat  got MMR booster like 42 daughter got could show big deal (and needed it). capital Berlin ban unvaccinated people restaurants, bars, cinemas entertainment venues Monday, country grapples highest surge Covid-19 cases officials reported 50,196 new cases Thursday, fourth day row Germany broken record new next week fully vaccinated excluded number entertainment sites Berlin, city's Senate announced Wednesday, expanded so-called ""2G"" rules bar people without two shots events 2,000 visitors also off-limits unvaccinated adults, officials move comes amid escalation rhetoric unvaccinated people national ministers Germany, inoculation rollout fallen behind several European neighbors Angela Merkel, video message posted country's government website late Wednesday, said ""in Germany, must say unfortunately vaccination rate high enough prevent fast spread virus,"" urging quick action national level boost fully vaccinated 66.7% population, leaving one three people skyrocketed recent days; country's seven-day incidence rate rose 249.1 cases per 100,000 people Thursday, 154.5 cases week deaths remain much lower level previous peaks, growing concern gaps country's vaccination coverage moves winter Minister Jens Spahn said country experiencing ""massive"" pandemic unvaccinated, early signal government directly targeting unprotected people join vaccine also called Wednesday meeting country's 16 federal state premiers ''as quickly possible'' ensure ''harmonious'' measures national level.

""Even another vaccine previously used, vaccinations given Comirnaty [Pfizer/BioNTech],"" said.  Canada least, boosters MMR vaccines standard late 80s/early 90s older shot, there's good chance never booster. Moderna booster shot 1/2 original dose might comparable risk Pfizer. higher risk full dose first 2 shots. Canada UK vaccinate large portion population two doses spaced 21 days/28 days Pfizer Moderna due supply constraints.

It closer 8-12 weeks doses. 

There growing evidence 8 weeks could optimum suspected increase immune response.

We also know vaccines spacing intervals matter.  Measles nearly killed brother baby old enough vaccine (think 12 months something first dose UK?) source that? think allowed get full regimen mRNA getting J&amp;J though? Double masking works OK, too, long paying attention inner mask fitting well around nose cheeks (otherwise, point). One probably surgical style mask, usually pretty good, 75% filtration material, since middle layer surgical mask thin layer good material N95, melt blown polypropylene. 

With N95 KF94 KN95 (which another similar Chinese standard -- little variable quality) -- need double mask.

Btw like Mask Nerd youtube, knowledgeable, mask testing station home, publishes test data many brands, discusses look mask. got newsflash two hours ago dog Weybridge,Surrey tested positive covid first case U.K. apparently caught owners. 80% *eligible* population. kids arent vaccinated, basically regulations whatsoever really long time. dutch people also never got board social distancing especially mask wearing lot countries (partially terribly government communicated them). add diminishing effectiveness vaccines, government waits far long step bring back smaller measures (more working home, actually enforcing required qr code system place) couldve taken mitigate spread, end perfect storm like breaks record. reason might get much worse testing system cant handle it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

my point concerned infection numbers majority population vaccinated. important metric hospitalization deaths

Even though Germany experiencing record infections, death rate \~20% peak previous waves. suggests vaccinations working intended  getting statistics based people self-reporting vaccination status, sure. would hope would use official records data though. idea, personally.

Side note, wish could come visit Germany. Tried start learning language difficult me. Best I've found OTC painkillers vs vaccination survey studies space children.

I know even one larger, mostly totally landlocked country successfully beat covid outbreaks lockdowns. lie, allowed.

Trying work timing. Went get shot today closed Veteran's Day. Could go tomorrow, son's last soccer tournament Saturday want miss it. previous Pfizer shot left exhausted couple days mild fever. Thats strange, way around me. First dose: sore arm. Second dose: stay bed 1-2 days.  Good question, I‚Äôm sure. guess since virus can‚Äôt actually know person infected is, hypothetically, last person infect, would end dying off.

The fact jump wildlife (like deer population now) adds extra suspense me. could mutate enough holla back later. hope not. Psh. Get Florida‚Äôs level. grocery stores haven‚Äôt mask mandate months. still abortions tho.  CVS let get questions asked beyond last shot was, now

CDC recommend people likely exposed it. literally everyone lol 1-2% workers.

So care 1% ppl die covid, care 1-2% healthcare workers (who obviously anyway) lose job... OK.. 

Healthcare workers quitting overworked, paid enough, ridiculous hours, days vacation there's staff (long covid)

Covid exasperated already wrong Healthcare.

No, not. random anecdotes statistical data. vaccines 1 done,

Actually, example established vaccine 1 dose? [The CDC list childhood vaccinations single dose know J&amp;J claims 1-dose, eminent vaccine specialists like Dr. Peter Hotez idea J&amp;J likely least two-dose vaccine early 2021 (and mRNA vaccines possibly least 3-dose).

Dr. Collins declined interviewed. speaking Reuters advance virtual health conference hosted news service, made clear N.I.H., government‚Äôs biomedical research agency, prepared back down.

I think Moderna made serious mistake providing kind co-inventorship credit people played major role development vaccine they‚Äôre making fair amount money of,‚Äù told Reuters. added: ‚ÄúBut done. Clearly something legal authorities going figure out.‚Äù

A spokeswoman Dr. Collins, Renate Myles, stopped short saying dispute headed court.

‚ÄúDr. Collins simply stated N.I.H. giving claim N.I.H. co-inventor mRNA technology use Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, defers legal authorities might resolved,‚Äù said. legal authorities, said, Dr. Collins meant government lawyers.

The three government researchers N.I.H. trying get named alongside Moderna employees co-inventors worked company scientists design genetic sequence core vaccine triggers immune response.

As virus began spread January 2020, scientists N.I.H. Moderna worked parallel single weekend zero gene virus‚Äôs spike protein. teams independently identified gene.
Moderna far rebuffed government‚Äôs efforts. July filing United States Patent Trademark Office, Moderna said ‚Äúreached good-faith determination individuals co-invent‚Äù component question.

Moderna‚Äôs chief executive, St√©phane Bancel, said Wednesday company confidential discussions N.I.H. would communicate publicly resolution dispute reached.

Some countries unvaccinated population number tens millions. hundred million US. 

Waves keep happening EVERYONE either covid, gotten vaxxed, both.  Aspiration serious point contention. increases pain otherwise highly beneficial making sure vaccine going intramuscularly. Many experts think myocarditis clotting (serious non fatal) could prevented vaccine never went bloodstream. that's actually works. Covid never going away.

UAE seemed basically whatever Israel did, around two weeks later. Covid numbers looking pretty good well. Sometime already gave good answer related nature science statistics, I'll mention something else.

It's moving target.

When hospitals get overwhelmed ratio probably go vaccinated treynd better outcomes prioritized treatment.

As develop better anti-viral treatments ratio could go we're able save people overall, would depend there's correlation vaccination efficacy new treatments.

So, yes, expect numbers different subsequent studies. random factors environmental technical changes.

What *you* though treat every study announcement new truth, rather single piece evidence pointing truth.

It lot work drill results study claiming evaluate relative value study. Thankfully though, that's job responsibility.

The WHO, CDC, federal, state, county Departments Health people whose job ingest latest studies, evaluate them, issue guidance.

Every single one organizations saying one thing: **Everyone able get vaccinated, get vaccinated.**

It matter ratio 100:1, 40:1, 20:1, 10:1**‚Äîeveryone able get vaccinated, get vaccinated.**
