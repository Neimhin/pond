There‚Äôs single authority Christianity disagree them. religion. also Pagan wants exemption.  Christians say religion vaccines Christianity not. Weird ripe abuse, obviously. I'm pretty sure every parent wants kid get vaccinated day 1 able it. solve problem. report less. would matter adjusting dosage spot, right? That's figured...  word getting booster pregnant recently pregnant got Pfizer. Seems like booster recently pregnant woman may bad idea? Vaccines freely available every drugstore, grocery store doctors office country. doubt much trouble. 7-day average going 2 literally need laws protect feeble minded themselves

This pretty much crux authoritarian vs libertarian debate. right stop people things inevitably hurt them? dunno, tough say.

Related NIH: year half COVID-19 pandemic, much human body responds SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, remains unclear. people severe fatal reaction infection, others show obvious symptoms. people bounce back quickly. Others experience so-called ‚Äúlong COVID,‚Äù symptoms persist long past recovery initial stages illness.

Researchers beginning understand human immune system contributes varied responses COVID-19. Autoantibodies‚Äîimmune system proteins mistakenly target body‚Äôs tissues‚Äîmay underlie variation. Autoantibodies found wide range autoimmune diseases, lupus rheumatoid arthritis. Many people low levels autoantibodies blood obvious symptoms.

A recent study found autoantibodies existed infection SARS-CoV-2 may account 20% serious fatal COVID-19 cases. Scientists wondered infection SARS-CoV-2 could also result production autoantibodies people didn‚Äôt got sick.

To look question, researchers screened range autoantibodies blood samples almost 150 people hospitalized COVID-19 41 healthy volunteers. team led Drs. PJ Utz Stanford University, Chrysanthi Skevaki Philipps University Marburg Germany, Eline Luning Prak University Pennsylvania.

The study funded several NIH components, primarily National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Results published September 14, 2021, Nature Communications.

The researchers found half people hospitalized severe COVID-19 least one type autoantibody circulating bloodstream. contrast, 15% healthy controls antibodies.

About 50 people COVID-19 blood samples drawn one day, including day first hospitalized. scientists found 20% didn‚Äôt autoantibodies first admitted developed course illness.

In people, levels autoantibodies high, close levels seen autoimmune diseases. Common targets misdirected antibodies included immune system proteins cytokines, normally help coordinate immune response.

The mechanisms behind production autoantibodies aren‚Äôt yet clear. Widespread long-term inflammation severe COVID-19 may cause immune system produce antibodies pieces virus wouldn‚Äôt normally recognize. pieces might resemble human proteins enough trigger production autoantibodies.

Excessive inflammation could also boost production autoantibodies previously existed body low levels. Vaccination COVID-19 much less inflammatory infection virus. separate study looked COVID vaccination, none healthy volunteers developed autoantibodies.

‚ÄúPatients who, response vaccination, quickly mount appropriate antibody responses viral spike protein less likely develop autoantibodies,‚Äù Utz says.

The team beginning look whether autoantibodies produced COVID-19 could lead autoimmune diseases later life. work also needed understand autoantibodies contribute COVID symptoms. vaccinated time got COVID?

Full person schooling ***is not*** solution problems.

But solution gets unvaccinated kids killed. second thought walls üòé Many people already mentally ill they're brought hospital drugs given sometimes cause psychosis. really think someone go jail five years attack nurse come anesthesia?

Source: apparently grabbed nurses wrist left marks came surgical procedure. gone jail five years? true? Remember said arm teachers? nurses? Wow, sure sensitive! 

The discussion censorship started whataboutism second amendment. 

You try looking arguing bad faith since apparently much trouble it. obviously mistaken meaning. saying spot on, except Australian Rules way form Rugby. totally separate unique game. Since 2000 San Diego gone 60 percent red almost 65 percent blue voted pretty blue. Obviously area going share nut jobs, please compare Florida  Oh obviously get joke. know is.

Why think said ""mentalism""? Speed probably concern here. robot pre-fill syringes fixed timings (there's limit throughput vaccination centre post-jab observation time) humans use later.

The robot boring necessary routine work, accurately (dosages) eliminate worries like empty syringes (tired humans). probably next best thing syringes pre-loaded factories. often people totally sane command faculties though? would imagine there's higher incidence hospital patients mental illness plenty drugs (prescription not) cause psychosis. boy ain‚Äôt right‚Ä¶ bit higher Finland. prices PCR tests private providers around ‚Ç¨200 (‚Ç¨100 government reimbursement).

Of course, public health centers tests free here. cognitive dissonance people still bring family members hospital also believe hospital kill and/or give drugs save lives. wife's hospital KC till December 1 fully vaccinated. bozos protest outside building week ago so. Enjoy unemployment! could find mostly speaks deplatforming working effectively would wish. understand arguments agree point: Deplatforming unfortunately creates tighter group die-hards anonymity hide behind. depends smart tech savvy group is, tbh. they're dummies barely figure computer threat spreading toxic ideas very, low. However, 'new blood' know way around computers type internet security threat going deep underground still influence high indeed.

About solid way could break movements dozens civil rights leaders way back (thanks racist Nixon): arresting naming them. Granted, civil rights movement count anonymity lives indeed ruined police locked marijuana possession minor offenses threw away key. There's reason many civil rights leaders country days Martin Luther King (especially ones well-known enough actually create changes). Movements *can* slowly start die deplatforming group know afterwards leadership fractured. (And government made very, sure 'deplatformed' civil rights activists ones left least radical inexperienced bunch).

That's probably one tools LEOs left type lasting impact: infiltration arrests.

Short talking experts modern warfare/extremism probably options (along deplatforming visible less effective tool), tbh. Though, smart person working FBI security organization funded government I'd definitely invest technology sector, speak. business that, know, accepts bigots use honeypot collect personal information track arrest biggest contributors (and might possible replacements) get LE scoop type shock-and-awe event coordinated inter-state level. would difficult would take long, long time catch good chunk chucklefucks type treasonous/criminal behavior would effective done right (we need another Waco would remiss mention way could go sideways let incompetent people run show).

The thing 'normal' bigots understand afraid consequences. 'normal' bigots movement effective Top Brass Movement carrying attacks money they'll get acquire end-goals. Bigot Dan die-hard extremist wants blow shit make point, Bigot Maggie (who 'normal' bigot) might believe wholly movement might really want take part 'illegal' things Bigot Maggie life likes want got caught; so, instead donates money goes meetings 'normies' go expose Top Brass' planning. Bigot Maggie gets plausible deniability Top Brass gets money fund future plans 'veneer' legitimate 'non-violent' movement 'normie' meetings exposed public/non-extremist members. thing would stop someone like Bigot Maggie fear getting caught vs. serving 'movement'. important fracture leadership movement bigots: lasting consequences 'top guys' face sends message smaller ones book thrown them, too, lives effectively aid abet (which includes funding becoming 'member'). Granted, 'normal' bigots react negatively become new die-hard extremists, but, again, would become die-hard extremists anyway one day volition (these types people waiting *any* excuse turn violent, imo, trying stop today stop years they're really invested hurting others). really good answers problem, unfortunately, mentioned, think agree *inaction* got us point first place nothing probably worst thing do. (I shall try get whole Free Speech Debate topic think proven, unfortunately, Free Speech led us moment specifically issue way complex nuanced want get Reddit).

I appreciate skepticism topic; that's indeed healthy have, especially site like Reddit. However, given *own* thoughts problem solutions yet. I'm curious know similar different thoughts OP discussing. must asked clarification sources deplatforming extremist members/movements.

I'm really curious, now. one worked hospital 5 years ago. Crazy people new. done approximately 10$ would love hear counter argument making assaulting healthcare workers higher-than-misdemeanor federal offense. least par physically assaulting flight crew member. effects bad education decades old subversion campaigns. Happens Bulgaria too.

Result: floridification / texasification Lol mean yeah, give direct order military members turns Fantastic fucking disgusting, nurses worked full dark triad. personally seen nurse assault someone scream ones assaulted get security ended strangling arresting poor innocent person seeking help. going good. Maybe offtopic, geez, there's second story first Covid cats' Liu, 28-year-old China's Harbin city, tested positive Covid-19 last week, left enough food water home three cats entering hospital quarantine, told state-run outlet Beijing News. trusted community workers would come apartment care pets cats also tested positive virus, workers euthanized three without consent  That's question tho, spike?  cost-effective, money comes different budgets; there's federal state money specifically allocated emergency travel nurses, money come hospital's budget. see this? What's safest course action vaccines, someone high blood pressure family history heart issues?

Without getting details, lots anti-vax people telling covid vaccines cause death, heart attacks, etc. believe chances slim, think odds especially bad, given stuff above.

DISCLAIMER: tell I'm horrible deserve die, leave house, go anywhere, etc. except work boss, anti-vax.I always wear mask anyone else around 100% best avoid contact people. I'm scared covid scared vaccines personal health risks. want hurt anyone, everyone life begging get vaccinated whole time.  Except vaccinated people spread virus much, vaccine shield.

this common misinformation reiterated around reddit. large security guards wear N95s face shields carry batons? mean Republicans going bonkers due wearing masks refusing get vaccinated, security handle them. screen make sure believe COVID real, fully vaccinated rational. know hospitals turn away refuse wear masks get vaccinated patients begin attacking point common sense would say let help themselves. brutal all.

Brutal letting hundreds thousands die. Brutal multiple lockdowns, lasting months still thousand die day.

This single city, less 1% population.

The sooner harder lock down, sooner lockdown ends go business like 2019. [Call problem we're several things ignore breakthrough infections. Health departments tell go get tested vaccinated, vaccinated say monitor symptoms. Additionally, many vaccine mandates let get frequent testing. Especially PCR testing, we're going catch asymptomatic infections people. vaccinated peers tested regularly.


So I'm proposing miss minor breakthrough infections vaccinated miss reinfections previously infected unvaccinated.

There's also issue drop protection symptomatic infection. Vaccination mostly happened 6 months ago. Infections mostly happened 9 months ago. comparing two protection wane going give inaccurate picture.

Where think protection hospitalization wanes slowly. better comparison. care about. Keep mind differences here.

In Australia, particular type rugby insanely popular southern state Victoria, extensive prolonged lockdown. grand final held different state (with zero community transmission) lockdown, spread coming spectators actual event.

This increase linked people breaching lockdown orders go people's homes watch match, day day increase stark - people coming contact frequently this.

Hope cleared up. increase roughly 500 cases, 50% increase state's daily cases. don‚Äôt know doctor? strict lockdowns Vietnam working. Preventative measures work.

That's really reasonable interpretation either they're using case rates denominator.

According China reporting 4636 deaths Middle Kingdom COVID19. rounded next thousand gave 5k. used models references states infections 10 times what's reported. stands reason case count 10x what's reported, death count 10x what's reported. China's 5k death becomes 50K. 50k still incredibly small number consider China 1.5 billion people.

Problem solved. could send unvaccinated infected people instead hospitals.   Oh cool. Right time too‚Ä¶. new wave. Vaccination rate high, boosters it¬¥s still go seen maintain vaccinated rate since vaccins effectiveness drops 6-12 months.

I think new wave possible winter hits. cares? Wait Norway countries ending Covid restrictions? Don‚Äôt vaccination rate lower USA? ending shot anytime soon? We're going able put genie back bottle. internet stay, access stay, such, idiots bullhorns stay.

YouTube‚Äôs ban goes that. ban claims vaccines ineffective unsafe. include legitimate claims made scientists peer reviewed papers? Would paper, come out, banned rule? paper controversial, support half trustworthy scientists support half? makes call? Where‚Äôs line?

Ultimately definition misinformation decided YouTube. can‚Äôt make sweeping claim misinformation covered freedom expression definition misinformation completely controlled private party!

Ultimately argument this: large platforms de facto public sphere modern society. Accordingly, platforms grow, standard content allowed needs approach covered first amendment. YouTube large company, aren‚Äôt game town. strive allow much speech possible quite point covered first amendment. smaller platforms many competitors, go nuts moderation! people don‚Äôt like it, go somewhere else. platonic ideal complete monopoly, must censor 1st amendment allows for, control communication. don‚Äôt think true. anti-vax movement thrives fresh stream uneducated, gullible individuals buy conspiracy strongly. It‚Äôs like ISIS, reducing reach help way. Without access stupid people, whole thing crumbles.    chinese confirm extinct uncontrolled spread covid.   Golly sure would appreciate injection antibiotics dying bacterial infection. Certainly would seem scenario drug injections important good health. think groups, rule, known long-term thinking strategic planning. shit.  I'm extremely pro-vaccine, anti-anti-vaccine, think censorship right approach. Censorship create deeper, permanent dissociation reality feelings victimhood contrarian people always find new methods sharing false data fits narrative.

Moreover, ignoring irrational contrarians, rational, legitimately scientific reasons skeptical new type vaccine undergone full LT testing. say disinformation tolerated go uncorrected, clearly known vaccine risks low compared COVID key getting us back normalcy. trust scientific consensus...

But shutting dialogue science still evolving fucking wrong too. skeptics turn right risks someday? we're baddies censoring rational skepticism.

The Facebook approach labeling misinformation right balance. Anti-vax propaganda form brainwashing. find ridiculous people point established reporting call propaganda simply produced organization opposed nut job basement. time too. Now, wait eternity swine owns FB follow suit! much natural immunity. Wow guys sound crazy. live America it‚Äôs free country. sort ideas beliefs banned? don‚Äôt agree them. That‚Äôs beauty country people right belief systems. don‚Äôt like leave go somewhere like China, Russia , North Korea government decides think them. Protests generally mandates. new definition antivax pro vaccines mandates still antivaxxer. 

At point end game covid, pretty much stay. 2% chance dying covid catch unadjusted age. adjusted age, you‚Äôre age 50 drops .08% chance dying. 

If vaccinated even less likely hospitalized. Hard know numbers since breakthrough cases accurately counted.

With recommendations booster even year ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù akin mandating flu vaccine.

Vaccine requirements new ones currently required (I.e. California schools MMR/HepB/Tetanus,Tap) require boosters except tetanus every 7-10 years.


With this, make sense mandate get vaccine virus that‚Äôs transmissible flu, mutatable, looking likely boosters required often? fixes problem care dearly about, makes room take potential voters streets maintain power. want felons.  think country world immediately looked moron say ""Ya'll"". would like think non-southern US also thinks probably wrong. defend indefensible? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è spent way much time climate skeptics subreddit trying figure still convinced hoax.

I'm also curious they'll allow cards sinovac AZ. planing trip months know brother got one two.

Edit: checked, AZ.  specifically mentioned GOP? CNN legitimate news source. idea talking about. excused mega corporation using influence politics post removing coronavirus conspiracy videos.  think it‚Äôs important remember western countries stopped using AstraZeneca younger people, mRNA vaccines available within weeks. AstraZeneca course way better vaccine all.

I'd take vaccine vaccine, case many people worldwide, esp. earlier pandemic.  


Also ""life threatening"" fluid term. someone HIGHLY ALLERGIC PEG, took Moderna, anaphalaxia, epi-pen etc. would likely keep dying. stuff big deal anymore. anaphalaxis (I'm allergic lot stuff) say fun easy bring someone medical team aorund, even pharmacy.  ingredients every vaccine clearly written out.  Ditto seasonal flu shot.  allergic gelatin taken 3 diffferent seasonal flu shots never problems.  dose amount tiny, probably why. damn time absolutely fitting username think it‚Äôs partly education system, real culprit think ‚Äúindividualism costs‚Äù attitude many elements pushing days. Many people don‚Äôt seem understand things betterment without handing individual freedoms. participate society, you‚Äôre part social contract, contracts go ways require everyone pull weight. Instead people want reap benefits none work, isn‚Äôt gonna work. I‚Äôm really sure that‚Äôs something school teach. would require huge shift culture. 

Idk. really relevant issue hand guess, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve thinking about.   Here's always issue me. Places like twitter facebook major avenue direct communication government. whitehouse right city updating trash collection days.

The power address nation official capacity controlled private entity platforms. right wrong, scary scary stuff end Trump's presidency. go, vaccine safety. surely hit government videos instantly.

Congress needs pass law gov can't use social media companies communication. literally excused mega corporation using influence politics agree it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, would excuse someone like Amazon?  kinda huge?   argument hinges actual policy is. headline says, ""Youtube ... blocking anti-vaccine content.""

I originally interpreted ""Youtube blocking content construed anti-vaccine"" sounds like actual policy ""Youtube already blocking misinformation Covid vaccines, banning misinformation vaccines."" 

What ""anti-vaccine content"" vaccine skepticism? video titled ""Why gotten vaccine"" someone says ""I gotten vaccine trust government"" vaccine skepticism ""anti-vaccine content""? That's misinformation disinformation, information - person spreading lies, - explaining feelings.

What video titled ""Why get vaccine"" someone says ""You get vaccine can't trust government."" would describe ""anti-vaccine content"" would describe misinformation, either. Saying ""you can't trust government"" lie, intended deceive, intended persuade.

What video titled ""Lessons history - get vaccine"" talks Tuskegee experiment uses reason get vaccine. clearly anti-vaccine content, supposing video contained 100% vetted historical facts, would misinformation? would say no.

You get idea. gets decide misinformation is? I'm okay Youtube decided remove misinformation I'm okay Youtube declaring anti-vaccine content misinformation therefore banned.

As points:

1) article mentions ""misinformation"", ""disinformation"".

2) Yes, yes, dictionary declares business different government. I'm talking personal freedom \_as experienced individual\_, though. Imagine world government enshrines free speech legal right, available modes communication owned moderated single private monopoly censors speech platforms. deliver mail mail censored, handle internet internet censored, email censored, text messages censored, on. write document word processor, notices writing banned speech quits tells find different word processor. sort out, printer (also manufactured them) refuses print document.

All really available voice pen whatever low tech enough able censor you. Would say freedom speech situation? Technically, perhaps do. go public place get bullhorn (provided manufacture bullhorn) yell speech. reach maybe 100 people lucky. one paying attention - good, engaging content online anyway. Technically freedom speech thrown jail voicing opinion effectively, freedom speech. according test (is company, matter size? great, rights free speech company's platform!) problem picture since government that's censoring you.

Now, obviously fantasy pretend-world made up. I'm claiming what's happening. I'm using made example illustrate point company size market share \_does\_ matter \_does\_ effect personal freedom. airline one day decided carry female passengers airline owned religious wackjob, company would go business fast. Competitors would eat alive. \_only\_ company, monopoly, used market power keep things way, guess tough shit woman. need government step either break monopoly regulate airline force sane.

So yeah, company size \_does\_ matter. Monopoly power \_is\_ relevant matters free speech. YouTube/Google monopoly, they're pretty damn close. big tech giants (FB, TikTok) follow YouTube's suit, would account 99%+ minutes watched web.

3) government company anywhere forced let whatever feel like, reason, anytime like, wherever whenever please (see No. 2). Especially intent deceive/mislead (see No.1).

This patently false. live United States 1st amendment right speech, even lying. limits right, completely false claim ""government can't forced let like"".

What hell think rights are? Censorship sucks. Whether agree position not, support someone able speak mind can't even what? want tell me, pediatrician taking care kids without COVID whole pandemic, ""can't even."" It‚Äôs hateful, dangerous thing I‚Äôve seen state governor do. would knowingly put part population can‚Äôt get vaccinated, high risk? top threatened take funding away schools mandate. offered give families $7k relocate children school mask mandate. Using covid relief money less. fucking insanity all. auto moderator disagrees post encouraging social media diet.

I think age women (unless ovaries removed properly accessed medical problem) taking hormones cons pros.......since new research.  sure would trade getting cancer relief even worst hot flashes wrinkles, that's me. :)  amazing consistently bad WSJ takes regardless topic. Maybe full house single family zoning. condos definitely achievable single six figure income urban dense areas. Obviously ""location, location, location"" remains king. Minds permanently made.

If big tech companies remove misinformation - would positive impact discourse. livestock cause pandemics anymore. vast majority livestock pet viruses could cause pandemics done centuries ago. test positive months?  Oh dude, could work home, ass would way Alpine haha, possible WFH :( good though.

Alpine, Mt Laguna dream retirement areas. love desert mountains reason.  also need raise minimum wage get tested work taken antibody tests along way also work. killing? I've never covid? case, are. What‚Äôs original risk? 2.5 x increased risk isn‚Äôt good starting point low increased risk delta also low. 2 little kids (both eligible vaccination) I‚Äôm trying get handle risk. mean original risk say 1% 2.5 x 2.5% original risk 8% increased risk 20% right? big difference 2.5 x increased risk. 

Also, standard level illness kids get hospitalised?

I live Australia state I‚Äôm next covid - eg outbreak moment 6 new cases state yesterday, change covid gets hoping get vax rates high enough first. last outbreak total 150 cases stamped covid many kids. admitted lot hospital, observation cases fully recovered (we‚Äôve 7 covid deaths total - adults - since pandemic occurred). 

Given living covid-free it‚Äôs harder get handle risks kids don‚Äôt incidences bad outcomes kids‚Ä¶.yet.  498+ dead children now. technology behind solid. Yes China US joke. also track vaccinations federally state random thing. tests start cost money vaccinated cannot get vaccinated real medical exemptions? Yeah, zoonosis common origin viruses. isn‚Äôt anything new. 

That‚Äôs many illnesses started crop humans domesticated livestock.  Nobody said natural immunity wane time, holds waaaay longer(according know body throughout years years medicine) current vaccine.

Reinfections necessarily mean natural immunity bad, CoV1 survivors still immune memory cells 17 years. LA beast mode California. plenty places live. also got rid single family residential zoning. Gentrification new urban housing likely coming areas soon. mind tests and/or vaccine. require specific test call dozen places make sure specific. Let's Forget Russia. loving watching America fall apart bit bit. new asymmetrical warfare work. Serious Q: fair basically everything killing rural Americans \~twice rate urban, except maybe homicide traffic accidents? Totally agree eating thing last restaurant January 2020. 

The first two points really strange though. then, visually impaired guess use clues (especially voice) far more. Bad bot Well, small sample idiots 50% stupid risk jobs   seas boludo. easy obtain. 

Maybe live. I'm told Taco Bell also cause this. work home thanks Covid. office UTC/Miramar area. 52 much better honestly   Except Spirit usually ends low budget cattle car everyone, including vaccinated. broke-ass midwestern friends choice Spirit, got vaccinated - make suffer? good point - back 1918, billion people whole planet. 2021, many India, (we think) Delta evolved. 

So opportunity pathogen evolve specifically humans, far impossible throw one two curveballs us.

I agree likely ""nuisance,"" feels odd way describe deadly disease, seems accurate compared hypothesized threat levels.  help viral load mentioned specific case, vast majority reinfections easier first infection, worse. case need require things everyone. 2 one group 1 other. Facts? facts? see opinion travel nurses bad nurses leave wake destruction path. mild asthma

There go. asthma. officially eligible per guidelines.

I got booster yesterday one asked thing eligibility beyond checking actually 6 months since second Pfizer dose. guess optimism one way go, feel like breakthrough infection Covid reinfection necessarily mild everyone every age bracket, virus likely still kill people flu every year while. Wow. case Fauci deserves Emmy performance! That's Simpson's paradox. People likely die virus also higher vaccination rate. always certain population refuse matter what. either going quit anyways, another job lined up, still trust vaccine. Also sure anyone would interested random woman's life story Death rates actually quite similar. rate transmission reason higher % dying. transmission rate due blatant disregard basic practices proven effective slowing spread COVID. extreme. extreme anxiety far willing whatever takes get Covid, period. approve even remotely traveling time see uneccesary risk everyone household. I'm also going dick stops wants do. can't think better word moment sounds horrible, feel consequences actions. live low transmission highly vaccinated state, that's part issue too. concerned around here. Think incredibly stupid go south right now, though. Especially essential trip. vacation.  still better nothing know what's around corner (ie: mu) think need protect country ensure limit whatever around corner. many new houses built Santa Paula, Fillmore, etc. Yeah realized way depth goofed. appreciate least realizing enough give even won‚Äôt explicitly reap vote for

It's getting harder harder sympathy them. California counties mask mandate. live Solano County, CA cases 38.5% last two weeks hospitalizations 41.7% last two weeks. hasn‚Äôt indoor masking since June 15th. 

I suspect many California counties start drop masking especially see cases dip CDC range 50 cases/week per 100,000 people.  Cant imagine stresses nurses more. overworked can't get patients quicker leads work (more days attending patient) knowing there's crazier line forming front. üòî  Yeah, managed get house that's outside downtown (NP/University Heights area), shared lot granny flat also rented out, chill sharing yard them.

We looking Santee El Cajon average cheaper city, also drive 8 killer me. know 27 year old vent months baby taken 30 weeks. ECMO too. kid without mom months really know recover. feel excess sympathy lot vocal anti-vaxxers really thought time getting vaccine would best. know someone late 30s pregnant told obgyn get vaccinated. think advising point medical license revoked. Flights within EU / Schengen don‚Äôt requirement though. Covid certificate (proof vax) required however recent Covid test required. Little scary Yes spectrum response Covid. doubt people lying proned grabbing food. think one groups much larger other. never met anyone wants permanent social distancing. No.

The negative test cop out.

Go in. Get vax drive. care anymore. add on

- wearing mask gym absolutely fucking worst

- it‚Äôs incredibly difficult travel communicating foreign language people accents

- absolutely wreck skin cause much acne

- traveling long-haul forced wear mask 24 hours + gets incredibly uncomfortable, especially you‚Äôre already uncomfortable trying sleep plane

- ruin make-up, can‚Äôt worn certain hairstyles (like bananas cover ears)

- us spent thousands teeth would like seen. 

It‚Äôs death thousand cuts. One thing isn‚Äôt enough make awful, it‚Äôs thousand little things compound think idea even airlines allowed unvaccinated travel, would still see post-holiday spike cases.

I really hope this. family haven‚Äôt seen two years this. know plenty people flown safely, I‚Äôm willing risk getting sneeze tube infected people. also caused idea hospitals profitable treat anyone comes ER regardless ability pay. 
These small rural hospitals lose money get closed parent companies, leaving nothing nearby  Yeah, makes really uncomfortable. Yes, misinformation huge problem, stupidity people bringing hope humanity all-time low, I'd rather morons (and worse) voice ever worry voices silenced too. lol!ü§£ü§£ October officially become ‚ÄúSick Shit‚Äù month. basically watching soft genocide happening eyes. certain media groups politicians attacking vaccinations, masking, basic safety would reduce deaths. 

Before vaccine, mainly urban America got hit hardest, due poor vaccination rates hospital supply chain issues, trend reversed. Church similar gatherings probably account transmission. Lack vaccination, obesity poor healthcare (hospitals, primary, etc) probably account rest.  thanks fucking anti-vaxxers. Perhaps vote different medical system then...  I'm perplexed all. 
Small hospitals always lot things like ventilators things needed keep Covid patients alive. 
They intake can't find bed anywhere, can't treat person there.
Add medical facilities within 100 200 miles real problem rural America. 
This problem Covid, too. small town grew Texas (population 30,000) lost 1 - 2% population Covid. story local paper recently.

Well that's death rate, they're meeting expectations. Imagine every place deep red like that. We're literally likely survive pandemic highly Democratic areas. Crazy world live now. Please ignorant. quick test anything. I‚Äôm disagreeing that. Simply saying access care problem partly self-inflicted. Cuba shiny, fancy looking hospitals compared US mean healthcare system bad. Pretty much entirety Americas south US much poorer less developed US Cuba better shape Caribbean countries around despite decades long 

My guess person's point is, Cuba likely hospitals overflowing covid patients unlike parts US. Unrelated, Cuba considered Latin America? worries, intensify lockdown. definition insanity. Ugh. opportunity attend sporting even (outdoors) weekend. fully vaccinated wife, literally beyond careful. fatigue burnout real. 

My concern 20 month old toddler home. Would making bad decision going? (Massachusetts fwiw) Precisely happened company. CEO heavy pro vax stopped right short ""Get get fired"" EO signed. he's someone else's call great. know it‚Äôs not, sounds like disorder always want rammed ass. Got seasonal Flu Shot today, expect get Moderna booster if/when becomes available me. There's bunch different flavors Yes, course still deserve sympathy course still sad.

Honestly, talk feel, sounds like fine. YES PLEASE

Would love feel safe flying rather trapped petri dish unvaxx trash Let‚Äôs this! Yes!! says he's better worms cleared fine. news, 2 semi-major airlines Federal aviation permits revoked repeated continued multiple COVID outbreaks canceled flights U.S. air space. Back you, Sal! prove age though? kids get doctor right now? thinking go cvs say 12. traveled internationally Europe. CDC card negative test enter. CDC card negative test come back. CDC card negative test contact tracing restaurants, bars, clubs. Yeah, bit hassle, make feel lot comfortable whole trip knowing always surrounded low-risk individuals worried. Another consequence outdated constitution / govt structure. Need total revamp consolidate admin/powers federal govt. I'm icu physician. 150% hospital 2pts per room. Standard icu nurse pt ratio us 1:2 ratios going 1:3or even 1:4. likly double occupied rooms bad ratios. bad many reasons, delay care (med administration, nurse burn out, supply chain, iatrogenic spread infections, etc) travel nurses help inferior staff nurses bc lack familiarity local procedures, stuff code cart etc. People die best longer hospital stay bc lack staff Also vaccinated people generally take precautions unvaccinated people. Watch video, good points. 100 level philosophy class cares variants COVID-19 substantially evade vaccine naturally acquired immunity may pose much bigger threat somewhat increase overall transmissibility, reducing efficacy vaccines enabling higher rates reinfection. 

It's interesting study, I've seen professionals, specialists scholars saying ""vaccine evading"" variants probable happen, easy. Thanks B cells/T cells vaccines would still work properly. Pointed ludacris stuff saying was. Showed medical license. Reminded believe shes intelligent choice make, realistic one. facts. Lots facts. free market wonderful?

concluding paragraphs

Data available 1,020 1,041 (98.0%) K‚Äì12 public noncharter schools Maricopa Pima counties. Twenty-one (2.0%) schools outbreaks reported &lt;7 days school began excluded analyses. Among 999 (96.0%) schools included analysis, 210 (21.0%) early mask requirement, 309 (30.9%) late mask requirement enacted median 15 days school started (interquartile range = 9‚Äì17 days), 480 (48.0%) mask requirement (Table). July 15‚ÄìAugust 31, 2021, 191 school-associated outbreaks occurred, 16 (8.4%) schools early mask requirements, 62 (32.5%) schools late mask requirements, 113 (59.2%) schools without mask requirement.

In crude analysis, odds school-associated COVID-19 outbreak schools mask requirement 3.7 times higher schools early mask requirement (odds ratio \[OR\] = 3.7; 95% CI = 2.2‚Äì6.5). adjusting potential described confounders, odds school-associated COVID-19 outbreak schools without mask requirement 3.5 times higher schools early mask requirement (OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.8‚Äì6.9).

CDC recommends universal indoor masking K‚Äì12 schools (1); however, masking requirements K‚Äì12 schools vary school district, county, state. two largest Arizona counties, variable K‚Äì12 school masking policies onset 2021‚Äì22 academic year, odds school-associated COVID-19 outbreak 3.5 times higher schools mask requirement mask requirement implemented time school started. Lapses universal masking contribute COVID-19 outbreaks school settings (3); CDC K‚Äì12 school guidance recommends multiple prevention strategies. Given high transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant, universal masking, addition vaccination eligible students, staff members, faculty implementation prevention measures, remains essential COVID-19 prevention K‚Äì12 settings (1).

In cases, disease severity reinfection vaccine breakthrough less severe. Me, too.  joined ONE topic specific group women helped lot people (non medical stuff) even started go rails many ways while..I take anymore......and pretty \*reasonable\* group starting out.  idea FB like crabs ina bucket something tends toward major dysfunction while.  LOL No. megaphone get choose can't use it. Now, get goons take it‚Ä¶  Beijing Winter Olympics ""closed loop system"", essentially bubble, accommodations, athletic facilities, transportation systems completely isolated rest China workers living inside bubble well. Vaccinated athletes able enter bubble without quarantine, allowed go bubble rest China. Unvaccinated athletes quarantine 21-days enter bubble. Yes, sorry first all, perfect example mean. would expect nothing less. Wait really? 

Isn't Portland like, 400 miles border Idaho? What's fav line, oh yea 
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.... It‚Äôs still 1% end though, right? hadn‚Äôt read 90 day thing - link source? state's case, East Coast state hit #1 deaths briefly May 2020. Everyone know got sick, got early 2020. cancelled one going go see irrelevant band. immunologist studies respiratory infections and, wow, past two years \*incredibly\* frustrating. Agree especially school systems open now. vax % combined prior infections, can‚Äôt imagine we‚Äôll yet another surge winter. Time universal healthcare. US basically major country without it. Yes, people act dangerously aware hospitals underwater. series possible space conversions:

* OR/procedure/exam rooms
* Waiting rooms/Lounges
* On-site call rooms
* Indoor parking

Staff moved COVID-19 assistance:

* Anesthesiologist? vent service now. 
* Vascular surgeon? Access/port service.
* Vacation? Cancelled. 
* Going home see family, sleep, eat? Sorry, certain politicians charge nothing done mitigate spread.
* Badly trained travellers unemployable locations? Yes please, let's pay triple.

So treatable non-COVID-19 patients die neglect, COVID-19 patients die untrained, low quality, sleep deprived staff, politicians slap backs preserved liberty die. Hey, feel like went thru early pandemic N95 masks unable find Lysol spray well year (and swore i'd never buy show shelves again).  protesting baffled nobody outside every single meat processing plant, (mostly brown non english speaking) people little protections ""ordered"" back work regardless, getting sick dying ......but know, people gotta steak dinner,, right?

Well, first off, coming WORK coughing covid, quarantined knowing positive...yeah, THEM.

Presumably videos making much money last year.

Thanks YouTube, always humanities best interests heart. This. exactly libertarianism fucking stupid. assumes everyone act logically stupidly. edgelord middle class kids suburbs it. need government protect stupid fucking snakes would pray I‚Äôve since gotten Facebook. refreshing. point time producers ,and think Actors Equity, require full company quarantine 2 weeks COVID positive case detected.  needed wait delivery wasn‚Äôt recommended country. got 5 weeks pp I‚Äôm glad reacted fast enough. didn‚Äôt tell breastfeeding time anxiety wouldn‚Äôt vaccinate me. totally would taken vaccine pregnant.

I‚Äôm surprised covid dangerous pregnant people!      old world. would highly biased fact US, vaccinated people kind encouraged seek PCR testing mild symptoms. Mandates work Boris Johnson take note Two years late.

Youtube decided absolutely nothing two entire fucking years, could cash fat paychecks idiot anti vaxx hogs spreading self destructive videos yielding massive corporate revenues.

Fuck Youtube. Fuck Google. Fuck corporations. Confirmation bias Texas sharpshooter fallacy infest ‚ÄúStudies‚Äù people extrapolate conclusions using otherwise legitimate research. aimed 4 years crowd. aimed 10-15 years really want lose retirement stupid fucking belief. order given CJCS decide discharges handled, think he'll lenient, intents purposes disobeying direct order. Nope. YouTube town square. They're private company  reinfection rate increasing already 1.5 years, breakthrough rate increasing months.

It would great data compares similar periods time since infection / full vaccination.  is.   national anything. Belgium partially ‚ÄúLatin‚Äù (whatever significance supposed have)... Romania, second least vaccinated EU country. course. People inconsistent displayed views play obtuse everything regarded slightest.

It's tactic attempt frustrate without making actual point stroke ego.

I've seen mostly among anti-vaxx conspiracy theorists. giving nurses tasers. Panic buttons stop assault taking place unless see coming beforehand.  sort assumed such. I'm wondering push panic button get bunch security people bunch anti-vaxers well death rates along useful parameters Mask mandates schools helping, too. Baker absolutely militant virtual schools sort, that's reflected stricter guidelines schools least. However, notable caused problems schools outbreaks, districts legit sending quarantining students busy work instead actual instruction 400 miles may well closest ICU bed available. nonsense we've seen, inhaling hydrogen peroxide might dumbest one.

Although one covid denier suggested ingested bleach. pretty bad. absolutely concur legal measures taken. Statues domestic terrorism form threatening/battering frontline workers would need enacted federal level, likely part COVID-19 bill.

We start ""domestic mayhem"" work way there.  Indoor mask use, Upper West Side, at, say, supermarket, close 100% now. much outdoors, matters less.  DeSantis yes, tested, would likely fail court was. cruise lines ignoring it. standard analysis mostly used hospitalization death, knowing reinfections breakthrough rates important might alter behavior people think safe they‚Äôve already virus. 

Knowing get spread family members cannot vaccinated might enough motivation actually get shot people mistakenly think immune future infections. make chart OP? 20 years now:

""18 shots?? many going need annual booster, Sir.""

""Only L1b3r4l puss. give Quadrivalent Prevnar go.""    Alabama article came 37 60(not sure exact numbers close) rural hospitals set close soon due lack funds,staff,and overwhelmed.
The day useless Governor Kay Ivey announced using 400 million states Covid relief funds pet project building private prisons..Also last week announced school systems facing severe food shortage.  imagine right. kept wondering average American might manage screw up. Many people hunt deer can't afford meat. supplement food stores wild game feed children. Well Said, 100% agree every word it. part business end day. Norway, Sweden Denmark already considered manageable diseases due high vaccine uptake. Life starting become normal Western Europe too.  Totally agree. Let's leave bigotry this, m'kay? Based quick Google search, seems 65,000 deaths Texas, 8,000 Harris County (Houston), though I'm sure figure skewed Texas Medical Center, treats people lots surrounding counties.  article didn‚Äôt mention specific ages children, 11-17; assume 11-17 reporting group Mississippi. So, likely eligible vaccinated. 

It also didn‚Äôt mention vaccination status, since vaccinated child dying COVID would news-story equivalent wetdream certain news organizations thus would highly publicized, must assume unvaccinated. somewhat alternate take regarding sub-protein say source. said read extensively months ago opinion. want research you.

so research gave opinion need inject every 3 months. C'mon, one act like kids. point is, specifically said 3 months. ask source. come back use words like ""fucking child"". 

then randomly give link, even say 3 months. said, use 1 minute find source. Oh gosh, adult you?

Going keep antibodies sky high. suppose get point waves become seasonal, might able fall vaccinations would carry us difficult months. realistically everyone going catch point. said catch many exposures (natural, vaccine, both) get easier easier body deal this.  think so. LOL, that's said :). Thanks needed giggle. one states competition make laws favor virus spreading. recent development parents want kids unmasked school get [$7000 voucher go different send anything help restore faith humanity. in: Marlboro Reds, Pickup trucks, bud heavy also able carry covid. Gods plan working. /s model considers vaccine evading variant 25% reduction vaccine efficacy compared current circulating variants (mostly Delta, guess) 

I'm pretty sure even effect vaccine waning exceeded 25% reduction. Anyone know missed remark made that?  

Also worth noting look graph current variants would compare peak levels winter 20-21, already got quite bit higher prediction, although got timing peak right. 

Some things thought interesting.. 

They predict variant that's 50% transmissable would peak around 2.5 months hits 2000 cases, variant that's 25% immune evasive would peak around 3 months hits 2000 population


But 2000 population already lot. something grew 50% population per week, would 5 months simultaneous population 2000

It gives perspective long warning window could good genome sequencing know look  Americans keep voting best interests.

And that, folks, one biggest problems for-profit healthcare system.

(pregnant) wife advised healthcare provider second shot first trimester. explained fever, whatever reason, linked slight increase chance birth defects like cleft palate certain heart defects. second shot known cause fever subjects could potential risk postponed 3 weeks received second dose exactly 12 weeks. 

Obviously contracting COVID way worse risk, profession lot exposure people advice may different. works home limiting exposure risk easy. 

I seen research comparing birth defects children women received second shot first trimester. reason assume general risk fever apply vaccine?   ""quarantine""  YES MUST REPEAT EVERYONE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND think so.

Mask mandates comes regional government(comunidades aut√≥nomas) one decide lift mandate not. 

In addition that, business free mandate mask usage indoors, think many business still going ask it.

Take account many Spaniards still using mask outdoors even mandatory. Let us hope unregistered nurse soon.   bot us good explaining. orthodox Democrat wants lecture Republican theocracy. lol Free speech like American thing though.

Healthcare workers need felony protections offered police emergency workers assault coming visitors non-impaired patients. Wrong, mask mandate comes central government that's although many regional governments lifted restrictions mask mandate still anti-vaxx problem likely solve anyways proponents die COVID.

It's poorly written piece contradicts imprecise claims. 

Just looking data gives clearer picture: [CDC 7 day daily case seems like declining weeks nationally.  People turn drop dime.

Let's see people rationalise freedom speech private companies whatever want

*grabs popcorn* viral loads infecting variant important make types comments breakthrough infections occur fully vaccinated individuals?  they've done research fine line ER Urgent Care. also line Primary Doctors Urgent Care.

Here's guide: First: Call insurance (if it) ask them: ""Where go get treated ex?"" give suggestions go. 

Second: Call places suggested ask take insurance, ask procedures symptoms. 

Third: aware! Primary care physicals, standard injections, monitoring, treatment long-term manageable things like high blood pressure. 

Urgent Care cannot get appointment primary doctor, cuts, broken bones, flu, titers, injections things, like flu tetanus, things life-threatening. Urgent Care place go need treated monitored. go emergent (needing emergency care) referred ER. go there, need specialist, referred specialist. avoid calling go, asking. 

ER life- threatening things, like trouble breathing, heart issues, severe pain, bleeding, severely broken bones (where bone sticking skin), overdoses, IVs dehydration, etc. Hospitals specialists staff. get poked eye stick, get eye specialist fix it. severely lacerated muscles hand, get hand surgeon. ill, stay overnight medicine monitoring. can't get Urgent Care - go home every night. 

Virtual doctors great simple things easily treated easy diagnose without getting hands-on presence. Toothaches, colds, minor things cured antibiotics, simple medicines perfect this. 

But: elderly babies exception. Normal sicknesses deadly delicate bodies. (A senior baby die things healthy person could survive.) baby referred ER. 

Another thing: Waiting ""last minute"" seen often Urgent Care - people wait wait care could seen early treated regular primary doctor goes bad - that's people show Urgent Care, fearing ER, hoping get away *not* going ER. things get hand, like infection gone septic - there's one solution - hospital - get IV antibiotic, wound cleaned properly (possible surgery) monitoring - make sure die. 

If insurance, think can't afford it, time try. Obamacare open soon. Go online shop. See something fits you. not, may time call 211 ask special benefits thru Medicaid. Lots people get kids medical care. might qualify, too. 

And put care till late. Find help things get really bad. need ER, go. wait. can't afford bill, ask ""Charitable Forgiveness"" form. may forgive entire bill, pay it. People still use Facebook?  mechanic/epidemiologist watch 4 hours day? Postponing elective surgeries converting operations rooms recovery rooms beds makeshift ICU beds. Except Florida Alberta seems So, Dad went got Covid 19 booster shot yesterday. However, may taken Tylenol 2 3 hours getting shot (he's sure, can't remember took not, usually regularly every morning). read articles vaguely say this, go much depth it, definitely little worried. Could effect vaccine, make booster work? side effects (body aches headache mainly) good sign things working, right? call Pharmacy ask open, figured I'd try meantime. little late Google Overlords  Would go anywhere quarantine time? trying minimize impacts COVID?   maybe. lot probably not. Since alternative nothing, good risk take. Look grr China western nations building facilities like quarantine overseas arrivals? American society irreparably broken, seems. People lost minds. Agree. Protests public matters belong public spaces only.

Edit: hell people know Moderna CEO lives? experience people West coherent view protests well. ask get generic ""pro-democracy"" protesters reply. Ironically reality protests driven hard-core maoist students believed Dan Xiaoping reforms created much inequality China basically demanding rollback reforms return ""true"" communism.

3. government company anywhere forced let whatever feel like, reason, anytime like, wherever whenever please (see No. 2). **Especially** intent deceive/mislead (see No.1).

Utilities don‚Äôt even operate way. 

They never have. Also factor Florida likely manipulating numbers.  third Moderna shot two weeks ago. flattened 48 hours (fever, really sore arm, body aches, headache). Worse second dose reaction. felt fine 2 days over. glad got third shot. That's kind they've doing. I've wishing would something - course realize they're private company right run business want. like is. hope they're what's right community. ultimately them. recourse boycott which, point, would zero effect simply huge are. think corporation operating inside United States goes directly core belief, first amendment, consequences. done legal way circumvent core values country operating inside it.

Youtube tries act like never done anything wrong? one ever felt wronged company people work going shooting people? crazy right? felt wronged right?   This. reason it‚Äôs accurate bullshit hospital admin told us early on‚Ä¶ ‚Äúthis basic, non-n95 mask ok around covid patients-the cdc says so‚Äù ..but disagree? asked manager fired back would fine. said due supply shortages nothing else, stomped off.

I‚Äôve seen covid patients last months ever have.  means Jack shit state we‚Äôre barely 40% vaxxed hope mother okay.   looks like going away slowly, of: vaccines, booster shots, incoming antiviral treatment Pfizer Merck, also ton people gotten managed beat it.  rejected science forged ahead magical thinking?  end day platforms ultimately publishers held standards liabilities publisher. November kid going old enough get adult version regret early b-day almost 12 yr old. anxiety would much kids back in-person school. really feel concerned parents 12 age group. hope comes sooner later them. good thing everyone kids able vaccinated!! Censorship key science....hmm doesnt seem right Although believe public health statistics, rely factors corroborate decent picture comes covid19 China. believe 5000 people China died Covid19? Hell now. probably 10 times more. 10x 5k 50K nation 1.5b people, 50k nothing. China done great job curtailing covid19. Even 10x case death count.  ‚ÄúPLEASE, CENSOR CONSERVATIVE FREAKS ALREADY.‚Äù

So you‚Äôre saying information viewpoints located Reddit? people get information?

See another excuse rabid stupidity lol instance, idea covid lab grown banned facebook, stance allowed based paper written people worked developing novel coronaviruses.

No stupidity. You‚Äôre literally claiming people pushing truth backed scientific evidence you‚Äôve decided believe opposite fear ‚Äúdelusion‚Äù. That‚Äôs actual delusion. You‚Äôre criticizing thought process point. sort like knowing biases, knowing can't escape knowing deliberately compensate them.

Then don‚Äôt shoot face take cyanide? mean LOT people claiming kill you. forcing delusion that‚Äôs actually way ‚Äútruly‚Äù live.

Okay, we're getting somewhere. totally agree everything said. But. Youtube BIG, cant compared anything else have. literally power shift peoples minds, one way another. 

If chose spread misinformation vaccine, would turn convince millions people vaccine evil, would still defend right want?  don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve gotten sick plenty times life. I‚Äôll take times masking.  Facebook poisoning world.  recently read article facebooks algorithms post outrageous content drives clicks creates advertising revenue! makes sense unfortunately kind news doesn‚Äôt get people generate clicks! Exactly. Scientific research papers rarely meant read laypeople. findings generally get translated communicated population science reporters. 99.9% papers newsworthy anyway. 

I'm scientist peer-reviewed dozens papers high-impact biomedical journals. give paper astrophysics climate science, I'm running encyclopedia too. That's asked though.

Like not, YouTube controls vast swaths online video space. Facebook controls basically everything else. 

I used use argument you, problem one two entities control entire space essentially control public conversation. 

Today agree agenda, future? public needs conversation whether tech companies much power, major social media companies decide ""you know what, want allow talk that"".

The ""private company"" argument works assuming viable alternatives. aren't, breaks down.   Damn. might enough 4 shots. may safe wear masks? eat lunch maskless room? Kind strange many caught guess depends protocols. vaccinated Pfizer breakthroughs common. now? Also important note long-term sequela unique Covid, fact happen influenza viruses. We‚Äôre able account Covid we‚Äôre actually diagnosing scale following patients (albeit enough). Ultimately signal finally start molecularly diagnosing tracking outcomes viruses well, even self resolve. western medical fallacy diagnostic jurisprudence set us failure Covid, don‚Äôt correct course fail potentially much deadlier pandemics future. 40% high. Alberta provides stats separate numbers people conditions. covid deaths last 120 days:

27.9% fully vaccinated conditions 0.9% fully vaccinated without conditions.

55.4% unvaccinated conditions, 10.3% unvaccinated without conditions.

With hospitalizations 6.5%, 0.6% 55.8%, 32.9%. Unlike medications, vaccines scale linearly size recipient. example, 1000-pound horse get twice dose rabies vaccine 10-pound cat systems evolved real-life conditions, horse get 100 times rabies virus bite cat does, human adult inhale much Covid virus child.
A virus carefully fine-tune infect cat 10 particles horse 1000; everything likely infected similar range particles, immune system respond similarly similar doses, matter actual weight individual. Covid vaccine doses tested different doses balance good antibody response reasonable side effects. YouTube done ages ago Yes, demanded reply.

He said January.  possible vaccine available many back then.......and he/she fully vaccinated now............so exactly anti vaxxer anything.  someone unlucky enough get covid vaccines widely available.  person also recognized dodged bullet admitted grateful it. 


Some may REMEMBER hard get vaccine beginning, family member cancer younger literally scoured online appointments high density state weeks months secure vaccine herself. Ditto people 65 70, etc.  


Nowadays, pretty much anyone whno wants vaccine walk 100 places get one,  like came out!! see, share source numerical claim tens thousands? need one I'm dumb follower ideology, go science reason, thus vaccinated.

Just stop politicizing shit, I'm conservative I'm American, statement nonsense biased hate. First all, I'm man. Second all, producers show made decision, make. I'm saying BS

I'll take word it. yeah thats fine. stop kids vaccinated high enough rate. widespread vaccination, better vaccination (third doses, example), redefining new normal includes masks high-risk scenarios. 

And we've lock downs bad outbreaks viruses. know least talks school closures high school student (we might closed? forget) flu. 

Who wants long-term lockdowns, capacity limits, social distancing? want people get vaccinated get past this. 50% population 2dosers, maybe 1% US fully vaccinated, yet. 

Deaths hospitalizations important, justify placing value things. Especially things include things like shortening people's lifespan decade, counted covid death.  basically advocating permanently ban indoor entertainment someone somewhere immunocompromised. Cases still continue drop US, seven day average 112k cases, lowest since August 8th. Worldwide Covid cases dropping well. may want read particular metaphore. hospitalization rate breakthrough covid cases 10x lower flu man. forcing anyone anything economy shutting people able pay bills.

Glad things worked you, sure getting downvoted. mean censorship really discussed censorship people disagree with, giving incredibly negative connotation. good reason too, instance really needs carefully weighed.

As term denotation exclusively negative censorship? Would mostly redundant widely agreed instances it, unlike general term crime.

Note even example brought fire crowded theater, judge codified idea law, Oliver Wendell Holmes, even went back set would never able legally enforced, used justify censorship dissemination anti-draft pamphlets guise ""clear present danger"" Schenck V. US, something I'm sure agree judicial overreach now. bigger problem, far, Facebook.

If youtube, facebook, facebook tiktok, etc. etc etc..

The problem specific communication channel. problem lack common sense, rational thinking, critical thinking society. education gross anti-intellectual/science culture addressed, matter many site shut nonsense. Ignorance overflow next one.  already got money damage done Yeah agree huge difference. saying censorship like also gets real conversations involved. That's all. right decision shouldn‚Äôt ban anti-vaccines content morons let natural selection kill 1-2 years preventable disease way out? Yes, modeling shows dramatic declines March 2022, also ‚Äúdone‚Äù back June look now. Plus mask mandates, limitations onngatherings,  Good. poor nurses i‚Äôve deal issue mom. facebook somehow convinced biden going punish cops prisoners would vote him. strongly remind prisoners can‚Äôt vote. luckily enough wakeup call listens tell something probably made get angry legal expert, wouldn‚Äôt sure that. Putting Disney‚Äôs significant economic power aside, weird quasi-governmental body set WDW basically lets whatever fuck want regardless Florida rules.    Maybe I'm nervous unvaxxed something awful irresponsible .

You mean already have?  Universal Hollywood great job last time there. refused let people indoor rides without mask. Even hour-long tram ride mask indoor portions. Signs posted every single door reminding people mask up. sanitizer everywhere, majority crowd chose wear masks outdoors well indoors.     Yeah get lol thanks lecture professor. point monitoring process. would YouTube accurately determine this?

 going hiring professionals monitor video discussions use algorithm automatically detect key word despite actual content video? 

You say sticking modern scientific theory. every video analyzes trials suggest might point away previous conclusions held large portion scientific field get thrown misinformation pile ?

 post also incenuated non-scientists inability accurately listen scientific arguments decide correct incorrect.
 case, go non algorithmic- route, non expert field accurately determine validity significance information presented? go algorithmic- route, every video discussing information could contention current thinking could pinged removed. 

 YouTube discussion platform lot social influence give power ideas. get trying stop people blindly following wild theories respect autonomy private company shutting debate subjects worrisome opinion.  bad looks right now, Alberta would 7th 1st doses 10th fully vaccinated State.  natural childbirth day beach most.......all gotta say ever kidney stone gets stuck bladder shaped like thousand-sided rock sharp edes.....and budge. .  Natural childbirth triplets......at least! get Pfizer, good getting info options 15 years late, thanks least anti-vaxxers also take regeneron EUA get infected. think some, all, anti-vaxxers can‚Äôt properly articulate they‚Äôre willing take chances getting covid rather take vaccine get sick bets they‚Äôll take whatever. It‚Äôs dumb. get vaccinated.

Exactly.  pill ""treat"" covid, correct?  would use it.  


For covid avoidance, prefer vaccine. Vaccines remain body long except deliver thing immune system needs ""see identify"".  


Unlike meds, stay system......yet people popping OTC stuff, sometimes daily, like going style, half-lives stay while, washing back soda pop ....... afraid vaccine. Ok, that's dad anecdotal evidence best. really want argue this. going collectively pretend pandemic process happening, might want drop idea. People may vaccinated health issues put risk. good night.  million dollar question, it? guess probably not. Cold temperatures, spending time indoors, pandemic fatigue... Colds, flu, etc hit hardest winter it. Covid natural immunity strong 90 days really variable whether people keep not, degree. 90 days August-September (Delta peak) November-December (cold weather, lots traveling household mixing) worries me. Would gladly, happily, enthusiastically eat words I'm wrong. canaries Houston Tx area deafening. Sure, theory, I've especially never heard thing happening‚Äîand given nobody country gets vaccinated flu.

Even got couple times life, parents would closely tend never got me. Laura Ingraham says hospitals lying overwhelmed. I'm confused... pay numbers seem bottlenecking Central District Health process, coincidentally, 1K labs per day.  backlog 11K cases last 10 days = 1K cases per day.

How coincidental indeed.  Except vast majority breakthrough covid cases get nearly sick unvaccinated people. Case point dad breakthrough case extremely mild symptoms virtually indistinguishable cold. one mild breakthrough case, fact know one person moderate one.

Breakthrough cases reason shut everything. They're going happen majority going mild. Unless extraordinarily high fever, symptoms typical non-life threatening COVID symptoms. 

Please go hospital COVID unless chest pain, shortness breath, severe abdominal pain, trouble staying awake, severe dehydration, blue lips blue fingertips toes, severe fatigue (inability get up, stand) experience confusion upon waking. 

Get tested. 

Try virtual visit doctor, go urgent care. 

Inquire monoclonal antibody treatments. easy. Google locality. 

Please. So, honest question‚Ä¶from fully vaxed, pro-vax person. source of

Antivaxxers disgusting selfish.

Let's say views earth flat mole people live opposite side control governments. can't provide sound evidence it, really believe it.

Also fairness doctrine deprecated 1987 people could cough strangers super markets, make scenes airplanes, forge vaccination cards, taunt threaten people town hall events.

They actively leave vectors pandemic spread, worse, giving virus ability evolve virulant form (already mu variant).

Logical, sane people encourage others wear masks vaccinate. people retaliate bigotry, misinformation, violence.

I've always said ""I wish thought drinking sea water would cure covid"" know what, already many self destructive methods choose from.

All wear masks vaccinate. difficult. choose make so. Doubt that. would anyone bother importing cards China? don‚Äôt get it, people know use scanner print something cardstock? No, couldn't. need little phone number that. time relaxing restrictions people inside people holidays.

Deplatforming *IMPORTANT* assuring extremism eventually die slowly surely reaching broad audience, however flipside die-hard extremists become even violent entrenched feeling like they're 'attacked, etc.' might lead even horrific shit might deplatformed.

However... might driven extreme measures *sooner* mean eventually gotten point eventually. People die-hard usually look reason lash others (or show 'big dick' other, like-minded bigots); hell, even given reason they'll invent one shit-stir own.

It's pretty complicated, tbh, choose route I'd take --- deplatforming killing huge chunk 'new blood recruits' next fifty years leaving waiting shit hit fan eventually --- I'd choose deplatforming. likely die-hards violent horrific shit, least deplatforming hopefully chance kill long, long time come. na√Øve think deplatforming kill extremism completely (that impossible), there's truth thought take away platform future supporters something, 'movement' starts die enough time passed.

Sadly, deplatforming enough stop misinformation hatred spread among tight-knit groups already primed believe whatever read. There's easy solution, deplatforming pretty much one easiest ones try control problem next generation.

Yeah, sure. YES PLEASE. vaccine requirement would amazing! negative test better nothing now, depending time frame think provides much protection.

At point, airport employees vaccinated right? TSA federal employees, airlines instituting vaccine mandates employees. guess know vaccine mandates apply folks work shops airports, vast majority people airports passengers, requiring vaccines would big step right direction. point, think Mother Nature, God, whatever punking us, making ridiculous, hilarious painful symptoms refuse get vaccinated. relieved symptoms resting worsened them.

*""Disconnect perception reality""* become nation-wide alternative belief system sadly turned rural communities COVID kill boxes.  Either turn away unvaccinated customers turn away customers afraid travel unvaccinated. Either way choose turn away.  Fact people get Vaccinated go work, never stopped working, Covid never needed financial help. People need stop lazy go get job get vaccine. 

The reason pandemic dragging long people don‚Äôt care. Plain simple. limited testing availability time, drove 30 minutes home Dallas free-standing emergency room Lewisville, Texas. 

Also keep mind many people rural America pretty far CVS Walgreens. put Phantom, that‚Äôs dude wearing mask. Kenney declared ‚Äúbest summer ever‚Äù would move could afford honestly...we live Illinois fine winters usually suck also love Disneyland...yeah, cliche'd...but California affordable, would move got mine. got vaccinated pregnancy back March. it‚Äôs 6 months. easy set appointment local pharmacy. Play music loud ..jail That‚Äôs mysterious puzzling pay $250 Ca boutique fancy doctors office results quick. $16k travesty. multiple things aware play it.

First, universal health care sort. means hospitals need expect certain percentage people can't pay bill, need increase costs cover people can't pay. turn causes people unable pay, leading increased costs.

Second, hospitals set prices way force insurance companies negotiation table, assumption insurance companies pay it. ibuprofen cost 10 cents, insurance pay that, say costs $30, sets price negotiating over, bring $5 something. Meanwhile, insurance, get charged $30 one pill

In short, fact hospitals medical providers operate for-profit system assumes insurance cover things, insurance wanting lower prices make look like something, combining perfect storm. Others may views, mine top head. Google picture cuban hospital ü§£ü§£ Went dentist yesterday Texas dental hygienist even wear mask cleaning. think absurd morning. sitting thought ""have ever even teeth cleaned without wearing masks stuff""; now.

She substitute normal hygienist vacation. Everyone else extremely polite actually requires wear mask walk in. guess hygienist exception though, like what? opinionated religious could see typical ""dental talk"".

She also nerve tell mouth wash kills covid, can't even practice OSHA requirements dentistry.

To absurd medical workers still inconsiderate. I'm big person wearing masks vaccinated, dental hygienist required without pandemic even happening... Like asshole point. Source up. disinformation. Live Idaho. confirm. Hurry up. right. choice fly. way spinning otherwise. like rest. probabilities.

People terrible risk management. hear people say things like ""Flying dangerous, I'd rather drive instead!"" even though 4 fatalities commercial airlines US past 10 years (Asiana 214 Southwest 1380). meantime, 30,000 car accident deaths year.

If vaccinated, things far likely kill COVID even think twice about. love hate anything that's dumb rejects statistics science, clearly said get corona even vaccinated, significantly lower chance, althought context crowded environment dare wear mask basic hygiene, oh boy, grab pop corn laugh time. is. Remember Affordable Care Act?

I still remember people made long faces found out, elections, entails relates lifestyles. cancelled. People extremes gone absolutely insane neither helping things.

There's definitely certain subset population wants see things like masks social distancing become permanent thing. critical thinking poor Terrible, people brains shitshow begins, isolates get corona again, everyone else lmao. Imagine vaccinated got gym lockdown, imagine crowded places like campuses xD 99.99% infected month. NOYCE! Common Sense Great. Great Job San Diego! amount salty tantrums delicious, cry harder,babies. Maybe kiddos grow sincerely hope probably not. They're free everywhere? live US too, though Texas, never paid test, I've several different types testing centers get them. That's actually bad online would've prevented spread corona significantly, look statistics, best combo reduce chances infection 90%, theoretically crowded environment get virus even vaccinated spread it... stay infected countless times too. Even forced college pfizer still got infected gym, imagine havoc campus do! gym ran limited capacity too! wouldnt want live right now! Hmm. wonder many vaccinated compared general Harvard population. ... wonder see Canadian Snowbirds?  IIRC, leader recalled outbreak first got way, threatened take away gov't health care get back Country.....remember that?

Are still that? seems like things gotten worse since (as in: Trudeau seems quite bit pushy late...with Delta too). Clearly due. covid grey matter brain study alarming too. could harming whole generation future population. short sighted considering deaths. Uhh...do realize US higher case rate Australia? 7 day rolling avg US 5x high Australia's.

So answer question, spike US COVID running rampant months. Yes, want turn away customers. That's rich Yes, would surely prefer federal law, tell upset Republicans hands tied. taxidermist NY deal hunters NY country. Next use meat addition hunting sport. deer feed family long time, know fair amount people contribute meat community fridges food pantries. know lots people hunt sport (or conservation mention ‚Äî humans chief predator white-tailed deer tens thousands years it‚Äôs important ecological relationship!), think folks underestimating much meat gets used, although less disease started taking deer years ago. Event vaccinated, situations, still going get infected, fun watch dumpster fire tho knew argue headline us misleading. ER billing insurance company $16.000 (after negotiations) still extreme grift. cost insurance companies passed outrageous payments shitty coverage.

Allowing shit happen large factor US healthcare system total farce compared rest Western world. sound like threat society must removed. [Vaccine manufacturing hard one experience mRNA (and [small one dragging feet mRNA manufacturing; simply capacity prerequisites expertise more. I've never flu. Fingers crossed. they'll get tacos.

Either hiding C-19deaths? (unlikely)

 social mitigations shutdown causing excess mortality? (likely) taking personally.

Here go projecting again. guess think throw around wild accusations one stick eventually? taking personally slightest. even sure take personally anyway. Im bit amused bumbling topic though.

One \*need\* philosophy degree accuse someone engaging core discussion certainly helps make look silly try accuse \*me\* acting bad faith since seem truly grasp concept. refused engage core discussion censorship

Lmfao. Well first all, original commenter discussion. joined discussion later make joke bet contradiction apply logic.

Well would ya look that! actually engage censorship topic well! reading difficult fundamental level alleged intentions contrary, fact derail discussion bringing separate arguments attacking credibility people instead argument itself.

Another typical redditor misapplication ideas here. explained brought point. really particularly deep. also \*not\* premise argument. point say imply internal contradiction would invalidate point. thought would funny point cognitive waste time others engage since won‚Äôt discussion merits topic issue.

Which see hilariously ironic given \*I\* actually make point main topic thread whereas \*you\* instead... came miserably failed ""derail discussion attacking credibility people (me) instead argument itself.""

Exception Orange County.  sorry loss. certainly good know. lifelong midwesterner, furthest anyone would get transported care closest major city state. 400 miles would make us cross two three state borders get hospital, absurd. 

COVID really changed things. Healthcare extremely difficult access backwater town currently live in. think people would get vaccinated due well known fact half county refused despite widespread availability vaccine. reap sow. ""We let vocal violent minority run society."" 100% agree however, exactly happening long time one latest greatest electing vocal (insert bad word here) president used greatest country.

Now outside United States looks like first world country ran third world views implode point probably try, succeed, take half planet them. doesn‚Äôt cause people get vaccinated, nothing will. Exactly. CDC recommending vaccine pregnant women fairly recent change-- August 11th, looks like quick google.

A woman waited CDC's advice would fully vaccinated like, week. deserve it!!! keep attempting explain. Back 2020 extensive number analysis FL non-covid respiratory deaths. 500% 5 years year. FL's covid death numbers much higher reported 50k. Ideally study would look different time frames previously infected (ie: protection 0-3 months negative tests, 3-6 months, 6-9 months, etc) , could figure reach certain thresholds vaccine shot would provide significant benefit. Harder get compliance reinstating measures continue existing measures drive spread point virus difficulty reaching high numbers.   poster says ""...among Grassroots participants"".  pray tell Grassroots participant?  

Looking website, think group people subscribe (volunteer for) service tracks nutrients levels via testing whatnot.  IOW: people worried, concerned, interested personal health, etc.  Probably lot self selection special selection going participants.

The study linked above, subject randomly pulled another medical study going on.  Says 40-80 y.o. range ... would yield worse Vit.D results I'm sure, even point (the people C19 mostly killing).  Yup. People way contentious hunting when, say, going grocery store sending kids school.

I'm sick religion, ignorance politics always trumping science. time shit anymore anti-vax people simply ignorant idiots. 

If shows true character, thank fuck time everyone grow fuck stop politicizing using idiotic ""I need understand myself"" first crap. okay trust specialists fields shit literal decades. also sounds like need stop sensitive take everything ""you dumb"" mentality. nothing everything YOU. one getting vaccinated, idiotic concerns absolutely baseless.  

And people like sick tired people like drag damn feet make something last years instead months. far, looks like COVID killed children fruit-flavored vape juice. 

I remember took state couple weeks go ""maybe acting it"" ""completely banning fruit-flavored vapes protect kids"". 

Now, they're trying ban protection kids COVID time frame. 

Gotta love /s. oh ... I'm asking question? Disinformation excess mortality mitigations. Australia's definitely higher (all little) they're case load flat time ....doesn't whole argument kids school get socialization instead online learning home? 

6 one, half dozen other, guess Yep! Horror Nights Universal Studios Hollywood everyone masked. heard employees yelling people put masks noses multiple times throughout night. feel like university different though. Feels like we‚Äôve lot cautious average uni. one uni‚Äôs never dropped mask mandate things started getting better early summer Delta hit, one get in-person commencement spring (while allowed football game time made many suspect virtual commencement saving money rather Covid safety). speaking which, might even totally Covid - apparently someone uni administration admitted they‚Äôve moving towards online sections classes run efficiently, e.g. students section putting online, online sections may cost-effective full in-person remote options. makes bit cynical university going back full prepandemic normal anytime soon terms classes, maintaining online classes truly allows reduce costs effort, there‚Äôs way they‚Äôre gonna let anytime soon.

Kiss benefits goodbye that. usually within 48 hours Canada. much issue get vaccinated tested prior visiting family US summer. actually least painful airline experience I've given people airports Canada.  be. majority public done needed do. Terrible headline. referencing ""hundreds fired"", needs context 17 million impacted. goes gd constitutional right infect people!!!! took mah jobs!!! /s \*le sigh\* I've received test results day scheduling test primary care doctor.  Can't wait retire Mexico, pay major surgery pocket. rural Oklahoma we‚Äôve lost many good people. police dispatchers, little league coaches, church volunteers, people loved missed. It‚Äôs daily hear read someone lost w/i 60 mile radius. Unvaccinated vaccinated still loss someone So, regulations mostly insurance side point. regulations things like insurance company drop customer, cover, pre-existing conditions can't exclude person previously sick (insurance companies used like 'oh? cancer five years ago? broken leg result that. Denied!'), percentage money earn go non-healthcare costs, more. Health care providers longer allowed hold information hostage prevent leaving example.

Now may looking going ""What horrors these? stuff even considered, never mind thought regulation"" agree you, thinking terms ""Free Market"" highly regulated. competent regulation would make things cheaper easier everyone, better regulation (where things referenced happening) Rookies... 2nd dose hits harder .50 BMG didn‚Äôt think Walmart offering free tests nationwide?

And get free tests mail from? I‚Äôm really interested learning it‚Äôs thing.  go ER like guy  Nobody hiding ""colors"". work medical field refuse keep patients safe following rules, deserve job. Full stop. Still, high incidence cases low vaccination rates don‚Äôt fully capture mortality rates much higher rural areas elsewhere. Academics officials alike describe rural Americans‚Äô greater rates poor health limited options medical care deadly combination.

We need speak higher smoking obesity rates rural areas driver deaths top low vaccinations poorer health care availability.  Good point, sample may great. That's also happening Qu√©bec, Canada. get ugly here! already employe's deficit! Hehe la la.  Prop 13 root it. reassessment selling time, disincentive sell market supply low, increasing prices.

Also, property taxes go 2% year, less inflation, city county governments less incentive go planning process new homes since revenue actually go time even though cost city services naturally goes up.

So people staying homes longer avoid assessment cities approving lot housing projects, supply housing severely constrained. time demand roof economy booming. This, low supply high demand, much higher prices. know misinformation. opinion. idea vaccines dangerous ineffective supported observations reality, aka science.

This difficult call. slippery slope. authoritarianism thought policing. people work YouTube choosing use labor host medical misinformation has, is, get people killed. sounds like joke somewhere, hemorrhoids, that's common.  Eastern Europe American south seem similar attitudes toward vaccine. mask mandate. That's it. daughter 6th grade, turned 12, teacher asked room vaccine mandate hand shot up. couple went bit up, looked around, went back down. 

Apparently teacher even favor vaccine mandate. teacher teaching bunch 11 year olds. 

It's bad Texas Florida, fuck south.  testing providers guarantee turn around &lt; 3 days? know take 5 days get PCR test results. completely unsurprising. lower vaccination rates, obese, older less access healthcare. It'd interesting test historical samples deer blood tissue Covid-19. seems likely introduced pandemic, chances know sure. possible along without crossing deer people.  guy idiot. went ER simple COVID test cause wanted extra fast. course going cost lot.

last year NYC people would wait hours front local urgent cares got bad started text line system. guy could gone urgent care government test site waited  could solve problem going motions getting vaccination. think there's anyone arguing protection would get worse, total half hour life. online surveys, long hauler. ‚ÄúHeroes‚Äù what‚Äôs right.  Thank you, difficult find info vaccine mixing honestly. kind got psyched learned bit grandpa's heart health Ah yes!

My point people don‚Äôt want fly don‚Äôt want vaccine, enormous group.

That's answer. dose size lot smaller. logistical challenge going getting every pharmacy correct sized needle. Ah, numbskull telling last night going about‚Ä¶ checked ‚Äúcertain medical conditions‚Äù page form CDC. looks like recently pregnant women would currently qualify booster. 
If someone near end pregnancy wait birth? Idk. 
Either way probably best check doc. 

‚ÄúPregnant recently pregnant people (for least 42 days following end pregnancy) likely get severely ill COVID-19 compared non-pregnant people.‚Äù EU prioritizing supply sold countries. case early Italy stopped Australias shipment AZ port would let leave.

Vaccination reduces chance infection given exposure 80-90%, paper 100% unvaccinated people going catch COVID 10-20% vaccinated time period. likely rate *lot* higher among teachers since almost entirely exposed unvaccinated people, vaccinated groups may end mostly interacting vaccinated.

It's strong argument third dose teachers, phase 1 studies effective 24/7 mask-wearing top two doses. know Texas, state alcohol board threatening suspended liquor licenses outlets require vaccination employees customers.

I'm STUNNED tells ya! STUNNED! little unclear statement wanted clarify: 
It ""not recommended"" CDC, officially recommend pregnant people get yet (due lack studies like mentioned). There's difference saying get saying they're officially telling get instead check doctor guidance. ...also lower vax rates. defending US healthcare, went ER request test. would request Coke (the drink :) would cost similarly.
It absolutely worst place go emergency (i.e. might die get treated).

The bills extra high multiple reasons, one people uninsured pay them, try get loss pay. doctor said go ahead get it. I‚Äôm around vulnerable people didn‚Äôt think wait.

Ask doctor. 

Also, get flu shot ...not many vaxed dying , need disingenuous. know reason refusing vax. Feeding America also important.

Paywall :( combination drives, smaller fewer hospitals. example, people major metropolitan areas usually half hour away world-class large hospital. rural areas people hour drive hospital may 10 beds good extrapolation, realize means there's ~21,000,000,000,000 hunters world can't afford food. eye opening due population densities urban areas; thing could possibly explain vaccinations; make difference anyone currently vaccinated facts.

US, everything open, tons people eating restaurants, going shopping, going weddings, kinds stuff. Even though college football games big, they're actually tiny fraction social interactions US.

In Victoria, strict restrictions - Melbourne still leave home specified reasons only, restaurants take-away only, etc, outside Melbourne somewhat relaxed. private parties watch football even necessarily involve huge amount people total, large fraction social interaction, much stuff canceled/closed.

There's nothing particularly dangerous watching football big events, comes large share interactions represent. perception reality. Oh I'm denying lack vaccinations problem. worse outcomes lack access medical facilities Wondering get third wait get mix match. second Pfizer early April. ridiculous idea, guess, Delta changed game. We're wearing masks offices month. really thought Delta would motiviate nearly everyone get vaccinated. naive me, know... Interesting. strong enough. Prefer fly airline requires vaccination (unless medical reasons). Negative Covid test required medical reasons get vaccinated. regular flyer business personal reasons (3-4 international, 3-6 domestic/year) flown since last long international trip Jan 2020. Like United going. context, equitable mean less technological standpoint less number resources? 

When lived rural locations, decent hospitals. ventilators standard equipment. Every Hospital limited complex technology heart transplant, city. could manage large number patients rightfully so. hospitals designed capacity equal local population density. 

In case Covid, many people sick given time. Sir Micks stated, following CDC guidelines easier them. Additionally, adequate time eligible people fully vaccinated. 

Does hospitals play role high mortality, probably factor in. However, opinion, lack common sense precautions real driving factor. horrifying - - nowhere near done. We're going tomorrow suddenly see headline deaths stopped. Even scanned last night true, we're finally seeing downtick deaths, take weeks months wind down.

Thanksgiving 8 weeks. Even wind easily spin back again. course, Christmas month later.  Coast Guard, Active duty, 73% fully vaccinated August.  sister's father law admitted hospital intubated. I'm sure overall prognosis, think prepared worst...my question support/resources niece nephew. One them, aged 6, incredibly angry (throwing things, kicking, screaming puppy) rooted anger grandparents (both covid, sister's mother law mild case). nephew furious ""didn't love enough"" get vaccine earlier. also says hates grandparents since apparently care him...the one, aged 11, convinced *she* gave grandparents covid, told dad wished time machine could take back hugs gave summer...




Obviously scared sad know properly process emotions (my nephew habit acting like care things think he's hurt disappointed, think happening here). know help this, either way. grandparents high school, obviously never global pandemic disrupt childhood.



What resources help this? Things say do? afraid grandpa pass, politics moment get grieve properly.  ‚ÄúDied brief illness‚Äù favorite vague statement family don‚Äôt want admit loosing loved ones COVID. Honestly, sure world view, sure COVID ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù vaccines unnecessary, hide truth someone dies COVID? Anything challenges world view denied hidden like dirty little secret. swear, it‚Äôs like mental illness point. thinking thing. fact developed entire narrative around - ""it's bad,"" ""it's flu,"" ""they're overcounting,"" ""it disappear like magic,"" ""vaccine necessary,"" on. calculus backfired, hope people start realize it. Unfortunately???? Gimme long balls please cancer? ""double"" like COVID rates, 14% higher (180 deaths per 100k compared 158 deaths per 100k). Also harder get access home whole time. Maybe, I'm means medical professional sort, already natural immunity claimed, I'd think vaccine affect all.  cannot simply trust you. much would want to. trust publically available data. average life expectancy Cuba 78.73 years. average life expectancy US 78.54 years. figures sourced World Bank. Since see life expectancy Cuba slightly better US, say something positive Cuban healthcare system. Especially account half century embargo US. 

We use health metrics conclude Cuba amazing system despite handicaps faces. long list things blamed COVID? think hear new one everyday.  both.

If vaccinated can't pass COVID test flying. unvaccinated flying.

There's really situation someone COVID flying point.

Tests easy obtain. unwilling it, fly. Don‚Äôt asshole. Yeah, cant believe anyone get domestic flight without either. thing yet? Freddy Krueger syndrome  Eh might day get little sick it, whatever. Yeah, that's fair. Maybe work deprivatizing healthcare industry make medical assistance available? least might save themselves.

Edit: Also, COVID vaccines available free pharmacy. Like Spiderman? 

Not enough testing yet. 98.75% adult population S√£o Paulo already got first dose, city State Santa Catarina 96%. Even poorest state country Alagoas 86% adult population first dose. Hope manage get 2nd dose year's end mostly Astrazeneca 3 month period doses.  don‚Äôt see realistic solution. take rapid test gets home can. quite accurate contagious period. ads run 1820, mate.   Turn where? it, they'd comply. one didn't, vaxxers makers fly them.  districts seems case. southeast district they‚Äôre keeping moment, momentum building.  second shot sleepless night chills felt like I‚Äôve cold/flu coming it.

Third shot bracing felt nothing, right rain.

Good luck! quick math shows Idaho reporting 1K new cases every day.

The numbers seem bottlenecking Central District Health process, coincidentally, 1K labs per day.

They backlog 11K cases last 10 days = 1K cases per day.

So 2K cases per day counting 1K cases per day. Things twice bad reported. here, felt like walking shit earlier magically felt better tonight hope work. want completely pandemic. Also, knowing YouTube, ban anyone even reports antivax people, even mentions word vaccine Seriously! Jesus Christ‚Ä¶. talking about? long last narrative throwing questions wall?

I'll take point. us first half Lmfaooo don‚Äôt know words mean huh?

What ‚Äúquestion‚Äù ask? question comment. even question mark found.

Who arguing ‚Äúbad faith?‚Äù I‚Äôd like define term point applies (hint: doesn‚Äôt). Yep. serious mental gymnastics many go justify getting vaccinated yet taking EUA treatments. probably cautious covid people. Won‚Äôt go plane. Haven‚Äôt gone eat. Wear masks everyday work even though I‚Äôm vaccinated. 

Even think said sounds crazy. spreading misinformation. China released virus. evidence it. information have, sars-cov2 came bats another intermediate species. jumped humans wet market. spreading misinformation. Remember make difference fighting global troll farms misinformation. internet awesome. stop misinformation.  Overall education. specially 9 people, main reason hardliners? (Thanks answering questions, personally met hardliners life). fairly sure antivaxxers would milk cat meant get needle. pill works, great news, sick bandwagon jumping one ineffective covid treatment (hydroxychloroquine) next (ivermectin) especially knowingly safe effective covid vaccines. word combination surrealism, stupidity disfunction. blame Trump blame media. 

A house divided stand, people. OK someone like Amazon using power influence politics cater them?
 
Or supporting mega corporations controlling politics ironically? know probably is, we've personally seen damage Covid exceedingly cautious. constantly forget even on, really difficult wear. 

10 year old pitcher! Way go! That's awesome able play position even though self-conscious. would prefer outfield.

Good move, anti-vaccine content would good way weeding stupid people listen Knowledge Fight lot, ever since got booted Twitter gotten way, way worse. new favorite constant threat/promise sell house keep funding Infowars, somehow always process doing. Sorry hear that, even BS noise. wife hesitant early August 33 weeks, ended getting thankful did. happy healthy boy lot less weight mind. No, thinking wrong - proportion deaths vaxed/unvaxed groups depends **TWO** factors - (1) risk individual dying virus group, (2) total number people group. proportion tell anything useful **specific** risk dying vaccinated, independent many people vaxed/unvaxed groups.

Linking discussion someone like week ago specific numbers use examples: 10 people hardliners? told would never take vaccine? Would say best education? can't even.  all. 

First all, 17% unvaccinated people make 60% deaths means 83% vaccinated population makes 40%.

Imagine population 100 people, 83 vaccinated 17 unvaccinated. 

Let‚Äôs say 10 people die covid. 

6 unvaccinated 4 vaccinated.

That means 6 17 unvaccinated people died covid, means risk unvaccinated person dying covid 6/17 = **~35%.**

Only 4 83 vaccinated people died though. means chances vaccinated perso. dying COVID = 4/83 = **~5%**

So numbers alone indicate vaccines offer **at least ~85% reduction risk dying covid**.

HOWEVER: There‚Äôs one major assumption that‚Äôs accounted numbers, shows vaccines offer even *greater* protection.

The math *assumes vaccinated unvaccinated populations equal risk dying covid vaccinated*

However, know true. 

We know age one biggest risk factors covid. 

The vaccinated population is, average, MUCH older unvaccinated population. 

People age 65, highest risk group, something like 95% vaccinated Israel, vast majority unvaccinated people twenties thirties, one lowest risk groups. 

So fact lower risk group accounts 60% deaths shows vaccines working PHENOMENALLY. 

When account age, compare vacccinated vs unvaccinated people age, find **a vaccinated person 90-95% less likely die covid unvaccinated person age.** 

So TL;DR, vaccines working extremely well. Hey, yelling ""Fire!"" crowded movie theatre there's fire allowed either. matter free speech spreading lies hurt people followed. Wait, downvoted? thought sarcastic. Honestly, effectively cage people has, still, killing people. They‚Äôre actually looking themselves. Pregnant women dying COVID. Morons individuals still chance educated shown light. So, gonna answer question keep arguing bad faith?   universal. surprised lax covid precautions were. Seemed like employees masked all.. guests. headline read ""The largest hospital state...."" make feel good act like this? stupid shit? like banning calling lab leak theory xenophobic? 

I‚Äôm pro-vaccine anti censorship. Fuck YouTube anyone supports censorship. Wait asshole back power start censor otherside, dipshits applauding cry unfair is. Nice job YouTube. guess know corporate line act morally. 220 million global 43 million American deaths, one more! first amendment apply private businesses. protects government authorities trying silence you. should. Problem is, year late, damage done. long districts keep notifying parent.  Don‚Äôt call ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù still call  Facebook deliberately amplifies conspiracy theorists, especially far-right voices. explicit internal policy.  even says right source functionally machine gun, called shipping manifest. also never used official capacity two ever made. TLDR: vaccination rate country &lt;1% giving doses Vietnam, expire go waste. Yep, here's exact Eh, depends team player. Jonathan Isaac missing games Orlando one thing. Kyrie Irving, however, pretty key piece Brooklyn Nets - can't play majority games (NYC mandate arenas he'd miss home games + games California), matter quite bit. way endangering children?


I also think know straw man is.  Knowing info, male age range, get vaccinated all. mediums, like internet, go well beyond framers Constitution could possibly imagine.

It‚Äôs funny argument never flies topic gun control. Yup, holidays big test. risk play heading holidays cases downward trend, people get lax. make mid Jan notable spike, might finally done worst mess, lots unknowns coming months.   Send money COVAX.  Unless fortunate enough capital needed gain residence via investment. even process super easy. Haha yea. past viable option planting trees, today worst day plant tree. Also 21 years? I'm cool that...assuming get opportunity. day feeling flu-ish like someone punched arm sucks sure beats covid. also inspired suck get flu shot first time too. always apprehensive before.  government ran site would run many issues would never get committee.

They would ban many things illegal everyone would still complaining free speech issues.

For instance, porn legal. Would allow porn posted? that's gonna piss whole lot people, first amendment issue. Would even legally allowed block porn?

What bomb making instructions? instructions legally evade taxes?

It never happen government would party hosting great multitude things many large groups would prefer host. Actually already here. repurposed FDA approved drug that's used label. around 40 years. Ended pandemic Uttar Pradesh, India. I've taken every Sunday 5 months. fact effective SARS-Cov2, want get vaccinated mitigate unpleasant dangerous side effects, take dose day jab; dose day jab; day after. Also helps long haul Covid.   3 Decades hit good. Good. Good multiple problems:

- Urban dwellers exposed disease tend develop stronger immune systems. 

- Urban dwellers less Obese rural dwellers.

- Urban dwellers much higher rates vaccination

- Urban dwellers easy quick access medical care side country (NC) mask ""mandate"" since outbreak hit stateside, even enforced (exception Trader joes Costco)
Hopefully vaccinated enough built immunity shake deal high level mutation. would prefer see levels government require mandates forcing public. Lower IQ = lower vaccination rates? Certain geographical regions = lower IQ?

Amazing points man. Oklahoma, exact same. wish vaccine requirement nice completely normal college. Cases tanking that's nice (knocks wood). it'll stay proposed bill. went dentist earlier year fully vaccinated hygienist thankfully wearing mask, waited till elbows deep inside mouth tell anti vax was. 

I another cleaning automatically scheduled last month, called confirm. told wanted reschedule comfortable staff's vaccination statuses especially Delta surging barked back ""well lot us get vaccinated matter reschedule for, even year now, change, still get vaccinated"".

Haven't back, looking new dentist. take occasional Klonopin sleep anxiety. Good know covered get restless brown eye syndrome üòÉüí© couple issues augment:

1) would decide facts taught syllabus? feds? state? governor? board education? FL/TX example would ban facts, they've done mask mandates, even knowing truth. fact people use YT educational purposes, claim education solve problem, fake ""education"" platform aggravate issue? 


2) Let's assume consensus among states could pass funding education (which clearly blocked right), long think would take educate kids? Also propose educating adults propagating misinformation source FB/Youtube? We've already lost 700,000 lives, long think education effort would last finally see results? many lives would ok losing time?

The core issue right know people refusing vaccines based disinformation shared online. large segment population truly rational, low vaccination rate given fact got first dibs vaccine supply. Since we've identified problem, important take immediate steps stem source lies - YT right thing. Else Americans fooled lies needlessly die continue ignorantly propagate virus. given 9 months educate themselves, instead filled hospital beds, continued sabotage recovery efforts. people also describe loved ones winning fight cured die.  Apparently Abdala Soberana 02. They're 82, they've good run, buried daughter summer. fighting much.

I'm close want die part feels like death would vain, important legacy leave. Suffering dying needlessly ""principals"" powerful lesson son's generation descendants remember much personally, forever know killed why. executive branch could EO, Biden want piss airlines they're acting good faith right now, decided go 100+ employees route. Well let's see:

I like seeing people's emotions, especially smiles

It's easier understand people saying see lips

When hot. humid, super cold, masks become uncomfortable.

If allow eating, purely security theater places eat

Big concerts, sporting events, big crowds, far fun without masks. guess concern validating feelings (which totally get honestly feel way) also making sure room real sadness? fear cling anger guilt deal grief, negatively impact later on...I know. difficult lot people lives much like ""well, unvaxxed made choice deserve sympathy"" get impression kids hearing **they** deserve sympathy? One cousins ""ashamed"" tell teacher grandpa hospital covid ""knew"" sad it. Like, wtf. 10 year olds allowed sad scares this! 20s grandma, smoker, died lung cancer. maybe blame illness? Yes, still get miss her. That's really dangerous. Hygienists absolutely masking up, pandemic. universal precautions kind work.

It's like surgeon washing hands. Congratulations living conformist society. upsides (vaccine uptake), also downsides much more. Reality interpreted senses objective, mate. So, might little nose.

Reality perceived. 600 employee *holdouts*. Legit question. ever hiring? hallways! oldest father conceived child 96. Ctrl + F‚Äôd ‚Äúlong‚Äù ofc results wanted aren‚Äôt No. wrong vaccine.

There difference wrong something nuts. Ah, *would* explain around 40K yearly fatalities US car crashes, little year later covid killed... {*checks notes*}... 600K‚ÄΩ 

Your math off.  Yay! :) Nothing romantic spending much money ""tradition"" invented diamond companies make money.

I made wife's ring olive wood. Oh sure, think that's important distinction. actual *provider* trying rip off. anything often constrained recommend simply know insurance cover it. Lol don‚Äôt know follow guidelines. People consuming enough sensionalist, anecdote driven data realize vaccinated greatly protects also extends benefit around you. Literally worried healthy younger person vaccinated? Shit happens There's ""we"" here. specific people organizations who've put effort making happen (or, bad, allowed happen order make money). Fox News contributors, politicians, foreign troll farms, social media companies. Heck, Reddit one organizations. really exact number. number countries delayed second dose several months (with potentially better results standard dosing). Additionally, number vaccines delays 6+ months boosters. 

I would strongly recommend go get second dose. many people treat mask mandates worst? really get it. get scared vaccines, get unhappy lockdowns, mask mandates like... big thing? say country [haven't yet. covid testing requirement also apply vaccinated people too.    refuse vaccinated get introduction Covid hard way. Either way longer naive like majority world eventually, longer naive virus. point, becomes like influenza. Antibodies story immune response thus far variant evaded t-cells. Impeccable anti vaxx packüö¨üö¨üö¨ smoking years  also mandate international flight USA. I'm fairly certain least one Cuban vaccines uses aluminium adjuvant. That's bad news, though - imagine many antivaxxers would go propagandising communist light metal poisoning. Alright, I'm calling BS one. I've met several doctors would love leave current positions smaller facilities. admit, young bucks fresh medical school. However, reason staying hospitals larger areas tend pay massive amounts debt school. never late create public option fund well. Increased wages would create incentive doctors work rural areas well encourage people enter medical profession.

So disagree, forcing doctors work areas solution. Instead, could spend less tanks education public health. need raise taxes national defense even take hit. would need vote politicians care constituents large donors. could effectively use collective bargaining reduce cost defense budget without sacrificing production wages spend money people.

Anyways, point no. Whereas decreased access medical facilities may small factor, u/brettlewisn said, main reason larger death rate.

Please stop making excuses people's easily solved problems caused stubbornness. I'm quite tired debating...  Let simplify you: whenever going around bunch people could spread disease, need vaccinated. Got booster today? airlines already international flights many cases.

Im vaxxed traveling internationally while. encountered airlines heard requiring vaccination yet. Im it, havent seen it.  sources?


Most airlones requiring negative test fly, airlines going far accept rapid test this. Can't really provide recourses, sounds like kids valid points. Adults messed grandpa ICU.

It's okay talk tell ok angry. Adults make mistakes too, sometimes make big mistakes ends badly. mean love less 

About one thinks gave covid grandpa, I'd say something similar empathize grandpa knew risk/should known it. taken vaccine protect family. kid choice vaccine available him/her. saying treat people believe sort evil terrorists want destroy humanity.

Oh please, come on. Hospitals cities fun dip parties unicorn farts. Covid stalking unvaccinated. It‚Äôs matter time. Thanks vaccine hesitancy may case barely even started.  Corporations enjoying blaming politicians this.

Background 
Long-COVID refers variety symptoms affecting different organs reported people following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. date, robust estimates incidence co-occurrence long-COVID features, relationship age, sex, severity infection, extent specific COVID-19. aim study address issues. 
 
Methods findings 
We conducted retrospective cohort study based linked electronic health records (EHRs) data 81 million patients including 273,618 COVID-19 survivors. incidence co-occurrence within 6 months 3 6 months COVID-19 diagnosis calculated 9 core features long-COVID (breathing difficulties/breathlessness, fatigue/malaise, chest/throat pain, headache, abdominal symptoms, myalgia, pain, cognitive symptoms, anxiety/depression). co-occurrence network also analyzed. Comparison propensity score‚Äìmatched cohort patients diagnosed influenza time period achieved using Kaplan‚ÄìMeier analysis Cox proportional hazard model. incidence atopic dermatitis used negative control. 
 
Among COVID-19 survivors (mean \[SD\] age: 46.3 \[19.8\], 55.6% female), 57.00% one long-COVID feature recorded whole 6-month period (i.e., including acute phase), 36.55% 3 6 months. incidence feature was: abnormal breathing (18.71% 1- 180-day period; 7.94% 90- to180-day period), fatigue/malaise (12.82%; 5.87%), chest/throat pain (12.60%; 5.71%), headache (8.67%; 4.63%), pain (11.60%; 7.19%), abdominal symptoms (15.58%; 8.29%), myalgia (3.24%; 1.54%), cognitive symptoms (7.88%; 3.95%), anxiety/depression (22.82%; 15.49%). 9 features frequently reported COVID-19 influenza (with overall excess incidence 16.60% hazard ratios 1.44 2.04, p &lt; 0.001), co-occurred commonly, formed interconnected network. Significant differences incidence co-occurrence associated sex, age, illness severity. Besides limitations inherent EHR data, limitations study include (i) findings generalize patients COVID-19 diagnosed, patients seek receive medical attention experiencing symptoms long-COVID; (ii) findings say nothing persistence clinical features; (iii) difference cohorts might affected one cohort seeking receiving medical attention symptoms. 
 
Conclusions 
Long-COVID clinical features occurred co-occurred frequently showed specificity COVID-19, though also observed influenza. Different long-COVID clinical profiles observed based demographics illness severity. 
 
Author summary 
Why study done? 
Long-COVID described recent studies. know risk developing features condition affected factors age, sex, severity infection. 
We know risk features long-COVID likely Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) influenza. 
We know extent different features long-COVID co-occur. 
What researchers find? 
This research used data electronic health records 273,618 patients diagnosed COVID-19 estimated risk long-COVID features 6 months diagnosis COVID-19. compared risk long-COVID features different groups within population also compared risk influenza. 
The research found 1 3 patients one features long-COVID recorded 3 6 months diagnosis COVID-19. significantly higher influenza. 
For 2 5 patients long-COVID features 3- 6-month period, record feature previous 3 months. 
The risk long-COVID features higher patients severe COVID-19 illness, slightly higher among females young adults. White non-white patients equally affected. 
What findings mean? 
Knowing risk long-COVID features helps planning relevant healthcare service provision. 
The fact risk higher COVID-19 influenza suggests origin might, part, directly involve infection SARS-CoV-2 general consequence viral infection. might help developing effective treatments long-COVID. 
The findings subgroups, fact majority patients features long-COVID 3- 6-month period already symptoms first 3 months, may help identifying greatest risk.

Plenty studies (and basic understanding immune system) suggest previous infection least somewhat effective.

That's absolutely correct, previous infection give level immunity. criticism people chose forego vaccines, many think natural immunity protect future, forever, absolutely true. russian roulette getting covid infection, year year, innocuous final note, department health data, ""academic report"".

You‚Äôre entitled COVID misinformation channel platform. good news. Way go, YouTube - friggin' time. nothing basing stance factual information. like prove stupidity.

Factuality can't ascertained certain viewpoints banned.

For instance, idea covid lab grown banned facebook, stance allowed based paper written people worked developing novel coronaviruses. hope see dangerous assume appearance factuality you‚Äôve shown stance based stupidity.

It's tho. bracing possible delusions arise brain result things artificially skewed hard one way.

It's sort like knowing biases, knowing can't escape knowing deliberately compensate them. Lulz, good government made yours. freedom speech? dont know people downvoting you?

Any mention children really much danger virus gets immediately downvoted. Try dropping stat 680,000 deaths US, number deaths children 14 ... 328. That's 0.05% Covid deaths. comparison, 1000 children die drowning year US. Exactly total social control seen mortality studies, Delta hospitalization risk studies:

England study: study: study study: study: study: those, Norway said observe increase hospitalization risk. studies said Delta appear 2-3 times likely cause hospitalizations.

 Denmark study, encouragingly, said true unvaccinated:
""The risk hospitalisation significantly increased among non-vaccinated people among tested positive within 14 days first vaccine dose (appendix p 2)."" 

The Indian study probably weighed debate hospitals overwhelmed Delta surge fair comparison.  surveyed 25 academics. Ohio okay Universities. peered it. think it‚Äôs color plus head coverings together. fan base certain orange person likes wear color head coverings show fealty. Ofcourse do.

This mean think combat ways, like disproving arguments publicly (this also effective outright banning discussion, see history censorship reference)

There many justified restrictions speech objectively good since inherently suppress topics discussion.

Hate speech great example since suppress societal discussion, prevents people giving irrelevant insults. YT private company exercising freedom ban content platform. think corporations like google restrictions able do?  make anti-vaxxers yell louder  2J^2 Mennonites engage rest society. example I've ran Mennonite family climbing gym. understand difference expert given field, like immunology, vs. lot OPINIONS immunology, easy see people led astray. 

Some people give much weight information shows news feed aligns positions agree they've told agree with. appreciate care given enough weight peer-reviewed scientific papers based actual data, thinking OPINION-based ""research"" valid actual science. Heaven help us. 

Scientists rights anyone else. influencer's ability fact-check, challenge update understanding world around us, proportionate checks balances place protect society biases, political agendas disinformation campaigns coming anyone position influence large numbers people. Likewise, critical thinking mandatory every citizen. internet‚Äôs existence making lot harder free speech safely exist idea information.

I heard brilliant take whats gone wrong destroying free speech...

Before data mining around would never find echo chambers online. Im talking 10 years ago used internet. lot different. could float crazy idea would recieve back 10 different opinions...

As time went using internet knows every predispostion understands get ad revenue surrounds us people share opinions. end echo chambers real harm done discourse.

Instead fixing root problem banning data harvesting goverment putting onus corporations limit free speech. good slippery slope start sliding down.  bit late ridiculous, pick angle.

Who talking to, entire human race? Unless two articles written person.  correct. layman terms: function covid. Antibodies stick virus stop form infecting cells mark cleanup macrophages whereas T(killer)cells kill human cells infected covid preventing replication. There‚Äôs also T(helper) cells instead killing responsible mobilize T(killer), macrophages B cells (B cells ones produce antibodies‚Äôs later on).

The immune system animals like humans fascinating complex. single cell responsible neutralizing threat - there‚Äôs dozens little things always happening time keep us healthy.

Edit; also vaccine misinformation foreign troll farms   Great links. Thanks. think couple people might swayed info like this.  agree it‚Äôs ok disagree, discussing matter opinion. Many things life opinion based issues healthy debate.

What‚Äôs frustrating me, inability comprehend basic science instead make matter policy.

What‚Äôs frustrating me, seems opinion freedoms mean stuff want like. pointed eloquently, USA land different views values.

What‚Äôs frustrating discussion freedoms align views values. 

What‚Äôs frustrating discussion world views also showing narrow view is. Trying discuss USA freedoms single country dealing current state.


All opinions debate. 

However facts:

You getting vaccinated risks health community. 

The community larger ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù freedoms. community spans farther US perceived freedoms. 

The community human race.

Your selfish acts risk unfortunately comprehension warped opinion facts.

Vaccines save lives, full stop.

To conclude-

You‚Äôve made choice. However, choices matter opinion. don‚Äôt agree choice like agree disagree

You‚Äôre free make choices, unfortunately case, everyone else. Collectively, community (globally) chosen ostracize who‚Äôve made choice you

They‚Äôve done communities freedom(not USA) interact without fear rapidly transferable virus that‚Äôs killed millions. consistently transmitted thru vectors unwillingly part community due selfish perceived freedoms.

Sometimes, uneducated choices consequences.

So find getting upset that, remember‚Ä¶that‚Äôs freedoms love much, ones EVERYONE gets.

Finally, chose ignore whataboutism variety health issues. That‚Äôs choice :)

You could argue curtailment freedom lead authoritarian regime living rules fine. Modern societies live somewhere ""absolute individual freedom"" ""total state control"". society exist either extreme.  


I imagine 100 years ago, owners new technology called automobile started able go wherever, whenever, however. accidents deaths happened, decided needed rule system manage freedom way lessened burden society. Thus freedom absolute drive car, ton restrictions. Traffic rules aim streaking balance individual freedom society obligations. Hopefully red lights stop signs small price pay. 
I think that, similarly, start new technology called social media total freedom, write whatever, however. see consequences absolute freedom, decide need rule system manage freedom way lessens burden society. Yes, freedom absolute anymore may need multiple revisions think streak balance individual freedom society obligations. 


In short, feel authoritarian rule stop red light, feel face whatever constraint put social media. course, aim trying maximize social benefit minimize impact individual freedom. areas. healthcare workers quitting, vaccine mandates.

I'm happy university work Florida normal operations. campus feels like 2019 half students wearing masks. Masks recommended required, vaccine incentive program too. 

On top that, case numbers low. suspect students vaccinated, college students liberal average. 

I hear schools still requiring masks social distancing outside even entire student body vaccinated seems insane me.   I'm riding much days do, see closer 90% wearing masks, least Manhattan. seen 1-2 people per car wearing masks. Train full like pre-covid, distancing easy, mostly everyone wearing masks.

I see fewer people wearing streets (was around 70-80% area past month so). building still requiring everyone indoors masked hallways, elevator lobby. see changing time soon. would good segment look at, ultimately many anti-vax arguments ""better natural immunity"" due previous infection need vaccine. agree US healthcare market ""regulated"".

Can explain Canadian ""regulated"" market allow someone charged nearly $60K frickin nasal swab test? Yes, Eastern Oregon rural basically Western Idaho. hospitals full long time. family friend flown way New Mexico Oregon too.  say that? Looks like naturally immunity pretty good job. Wait another 6-12 months see much breakthrough cases shoot up. looking numbers 2 different time periods. Natural immunity around year half vaccine immunity around 9 months.

So, need wait anotber 6-9 months check breakthrough cases per 100k (or whatever number used) compare today's reinfection rate per 100k.
