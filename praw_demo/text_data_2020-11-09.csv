0,2020-11-09," Hi, already posted Reposts removed work busy grocery store. I’m young hope I’ll ok :(  mean businesses going away long Covid. Sad see go nostalgic perspective, simply necessary access book online click store pocket day. Actually Pfizer main part development vaccine. research work mainly done Germany small company BioNTec. company founded sons arabic immigrants. Glad feeling better could use specifics, dont think i've heard one know would expect confidence COVID-19 vaccines testing still progress? can't expect federal government able cover people injured trials, able promise cover damages vaccine even exist yet. right feels like reasonable place things be. Anyone currently pursuing damages would person vaccine trial, member public received vaccination part public program.

So think kind ahead here. vaccine becomes available public federal government recommends it, assists development, etc, course would reasonable expect covered NVICP would troublesome sign covered, strange currently covered. Saints fan colors culture mottos. looked fancy me. ""3rd wave"" makes sense then.

There 4 peoples vaccine got it, nine.

They say ""over 90%"" also.

Doesnt put closer 95% means post lot. Like said, time dont seem realise making mistakes.

You still dont really see article posted contradicts overly bullish statements instance. 

You dont realise difference something problem likely problem potentially disaster.

You dont see anything wrong accusing someone ignoring scientists blatantly ignoring scientists.

Thats conversation. big think maybe try bit rigorous. honestly think would good. entire comment section fucking retarded.  Simmer low heat 10-15 minutes, add heavy cream, American cheese, butter. Fold gently. Serve hot piping bag tipped hypodermic needle. Thank you. beautifully put. 

And one things surprised people midwest 'acting character'. thought character. represented books, media, limited personal experience, people region always shown neighborly considerate. less antithesis currently perceived. 90% vaccines 99.5% survival rate virus hmmm muh 5G muh vaccines! /s again

...after they've made 2nd correction. meant might correct we're mind readers. Articles title misleading, gun stocks way leading election, Smith Wesson 100% year ruger 35%. went finally course makes headlines. media sucks Uh... that's bit worrying that's true (haven't fact checked myself) less complicated seems. Send manufacturer dry ice distribution centers, use within 5 days. Imperial College said want ‘vaccinate people world, regardless country’s GDP’. They’ll charge richer countries subsidize costs poorer ones months old hits high points logistics  already hundreds millions produced already purpose exactly! betted chance vaccine working :) think spring 2021 sounds right campus, they're getting free covid test results back go. Now, could still pick en route... ""by"" key word. sandbagging normal. going faster think. Yeah know make connection haha. made become Saints fan?

And yeah, online school. big fan vaccine gets distributed vulnerable populations country within due time hopefully go back in-person classes, fingers crossed lol naysay hard that’s early. start feel it’s close hear one companies submitted marketing application review. think go commercial around time next year, maybe summer. Remember movie *TITANIC*? orchestra playing end every healthcare worker funeral home right next month. 

Didn't happen either. Wear mask social distance, cook wash whatever comes front door. loss freedom, routine hygiene. Excuse me, finishing John type this. wondering would come light. know virus far likes organs. brain organ. scary af. might soon schools going back normal non hybrid start 2021 school year. 
 
Not sure that. *want* back January.... due winter spike occurring, county actually rolled kids back full virtual. we're going wrong direction. Sounds concerning? Shiting sailboat, sounds concerning. god damned catastrophy. get word Icewise  Nah, we'll back normal Spring. sit home. Watching many Americans become part history... pandemic. Images like shown years illustrate stupid really time. don’t care one red, blue, black, green, whatever. 

I said subs January say words again... virus potential bring us together tear us apart.

Unfortunately, “bring us together” part large events ultimately tear us apart winter.

Silly humans. Big pharma really got PR makeover due pandemic, congrats Pfizer. Hello,

For anyone Florida working large company 500 less - 

I want get paid 2 weeks due Covid, company says use PTO (which uses 56 earned hours worked couple days unknowingly Covid) - get paid time use PTO?

I know research Coronavirus Families First Act contact department labor - tips me? Personal stories did? Batman would like word. Basically 2021 lost give recipe away manufacturers now? think going hurt lot. Could worse, could fighting first world war front, die 30 minutes amistace signed November 11th, coming days! imagine would reacted gave covid ""Look took away rights they're even unrested."" tough. cooler refillable dry ice container. dry ice sublimates, box cools. work health department, make sure solid supply dry ice. *adds utopia watch list* People thinking USA represent center world. Dumbasses. Vaccinate risk dying.  CNBC: Stocks get crushed, dashing hopes every millennial holding calls.

Mods: I'm gonna tag ""Good News"". wonder Dr. Fauci financial interest Pfizer. live right headquarters. Huge win us!! Huge win NY, therefore huge win humanity!!! 

I’m also first responder, I’ll let guys know goes couple months. Weird diarrhea low, in-laws experienced it. makes sense genetics would play role though.  ok, he's doctor Well that's totality universe, obviously given materialism going part scientific method matter part space. dark matter dark energy exists mainly voids space even around us, lack ability perceive even seemingly affected phenomena information need wouldnt consider day day scientific understandings Maybe get pediatric vaccine trial? person talking life UK. UK population 60MM. US population 300MM. US either needs deploy vaccine 5x speed UK, take US 5x longer. Hi, already posted Reposts removed  even need to. vaccines flexible Well shit. Mondays usually slow day reporting USA? cause already 130k new cases today Hi, already posted Reposts removed know Fauci excited real wondering, Covishield brand name AstraZeneca/University Oxford COVID-19 vaccine candidate India. don’t live anywhere near Florida I’m fine want kill themselves.   

Herd immunity requires 80% infection rate, 21 million people that’s 16 million infected.  20% infected require hospitalization, that’s 3.2 million needing hospitalized.   

Florida 56,000 total hospital beds.   

Every person needs hospital turned away due capacity **WILL DIE**.  3.1 Million dead Florida achieve herd immunity. normal freezer 5 days ""genuinely concerned"" another clue trolling  Hi, already posted Reposts removed That's standard lab fridge temp. huge problem distributing around U.S. 

3rd world countries huge problem. IIRC known problem though, they've created enclosures operate without power week Africa level temperatures using dry ice crap ton insulation. Expensive, actually tried distribute around world, could. roughly speaking, 90% people got vaccinated get sick, I'm wondering percentage vaccine resulted immune response causing level antibodies get produced? vaccine result production antibodies everyone, varying degrees, 90% seem get sick? 10% people generate antibodies all, matter generating sufficient antibodies react viral dose may get exposed to? know vaccine efficacies stated simple terms, guess I'm driving vaccine prevents people getting sick altogether, ones may get less sick without, definitely business! headline definitely great news, guess driving detailed understanding vaccination works. five days outside deep freeze. solves local distribution problem. FDA docs thought most/all health departments free covid testing. i'd suggest call local hospital covid help line (not sure might called there) ask free drive testing. expect? He's one least trustworthy people history world. That's generally type person avoid taking advice from...if gets TV starts bragging vaccine ""tremendous"" efforts were, I'd rather lock another 3 months. sounds concerning hope mix batches. ""I got corona vaccine give boner four days"". One harder parts shipping cold chain getting materials customs run temp control time. haven’t ever shipped Brazil bet it’s complicated country. Why? could possibly give enough people vaccine then? decided yet. Apparently freezer companies privately held. Emerson makes lot associated components, maybe It’s dry ice problem. -80 Celsius. done. Thanks, thought! thank volunteers time sacrifice. many ways getting Co2. That's cheapest Well, shit. We’re gonna need lot Freon. pushed back, end's 12:00 January 1st 2021. heard world rejoice celebrate fireworks, we'll see. german love her! Lets go germans! Vacuum flasks Question: age bracket covid deaths? 


I stated people 70, mortality rate highest, someone telling fake news, old people largest age bracket dying.  


If so... largest age bracket dying? Sadly, think make valid point. Wow. Come back actually read it, can. Poor little beta. vaccine needs kept -80 degrees Celsius requires booster 14 days later going massive logistics issue. aren’t rolling local pharmacy requesting demand

Correct. disagree, money's better mean...it’s true though. friend little headache several days ago work made get tested. Came back positive her, husband, several coworkers get tested quarantine. work might actually shut down. headache went away day feels perfectly fine. one else symptoms. hadn’t gotten tested, nothing would come it. one would gotten sick, one would died. It’s joke. mean that’s reasonable. families low level aides get it?

What movie stars sports teams? could make argument vaccinating major sports teams thousand doses, let’s massive industry partially restart. 

But doses aren’t going someone’s grandma, statistically someone die that. Sturgis bike rally, fewer large metro areas (which means government likely follow GOP population), low population density combined many many spread municipalities (which means coordination large health departments literally hundreds, poor, outdated infrastructure), strong individualistic culture. warned. warned. taken government HS read ""10 million"" makes wanna giggle like Robin CEO said last month safety data would ready November efficacy data would depend infection rates. Infection rates climbing right surpassed required milestone positive cases clinical cohort quicker expected.

A successful vaccine deployment going depend enough people getting vaccinated. incredibly selfish decide point going get it. STOP! ""no lock down, stay home"" this? way, vaccines widely available 2 months masks burned

Summer '22. 

I mean, widely available? bigger job think folks sub/on Reddit consider. Search ""mink covid"" new varient makes vaccine 100% useless. WI get play college football 2 straight weeks dropped top 10 people watching wondering wtf going WI Fargo Minot unenforced mandates. basically, no. Bluebell ships ice cream -94F? Wow realize cold! Illinois highest new cases yesterday (not adjusted per capita) Damn, poor Minnesota. nope I’ve saved tons money.

Yep. Chef John &amp; Binging Babish many new viewers lol. Hell Republicans support avoid president harris Okay sending people states?

Because every state also seeing huge health care workers striking?

Because want abandon patients. yes.

Bingo. Next summer bad. winter gonna grim. Next winter quite bad. We’re roughly battle bulge. outcome war longer question. still remaining fighting.  Lol wut really surprising. Many NY hospitals thing. long fever broken, come work. wife tested positive like 2 months even though longer sick. this, wsb? Time inverse. Puts order. Best case late next spring, worst case next fall. It’s actually pretty simple. Dry ice. April testing contact tracing treated seriously 

Which begin happen Jan 21. Now, Biden team together they're working it, there's chance we'll contact tracing nationwide level by...next fall. That’ll really depend many people get it. logistics around cold storage awful. Plus think needs two doses?

A billion doses sounds like lot that’s 2021 could entirely absorbed healthcare workers high risk.

So worry less killing grandma, changes risk tolerance some, could still get it.

Hopefully another vaccine easier logistics come along, governments mandate companies produce one.  Who's ""they""? funny Trump simultaneously pushed get vaccine approved election claimed virus Democratic hoax. would point vaccine then? time. Thank you. announcement additional data efficacy safety come following weeks. think reason exaggerate results right now. FDA review data EUA given. They'd get slammed stock market public perception data line they're saying. best way explain seemed though dots, didn’t know connect them. drew dick instead real picture. wanted say serious viral infections (like flu) also increase risk serious mental illness following two years. *just* coronavirus thing. It’s long time coming. got college pushed real world realized American society culture insane. scale entire population...  isnt Fauci Biden's task force? Sadly I'm sure maskwearing fade...  tough year people. Drones everywhere. Phones listening them. Mask mandates everywhere. President loses bid re-election big ole scary vaccine coming them. must tough seeing conspiracies you, everywhere turn! hope realize nano chips vaccine, easily added drinking water!  100% symptoms Covid, 101+ fever 3 days row, today tested negative Covid flu. gives? said it’s probably virus. Could new strain Covid? Ironically Disney probably place would want Florida right now. Masks required sanitation nines. step one foot outside bubble, though. mean venerable segments population vaccinated life mostly return normal. *completely* normal life might still year out. normal life plus masks minus music festivals sounds fucking great right now. work hospital staff telling patients need wear masks hospitalized even though testing COVID. WCGW? ""The implications identified changes variant yet well understood. Preliminary findings indicate particular mink-associated variant identified minks 12 human cases *moderately decreased sensitivity neutralizing antibodies.*""

Doesn't exactly mention spike protein ""*decreased sensitivity neutralizing antibodies*"" quite concerning. hope catch aids glad sane people sub.

I really surprised super hyper pfizer Pfizer said Monday early look data coronavirus vaccine shows 90% effective -- much better expected efficacy trend continues.  so-called interim analysis looked first 94 confirmed cases Covid-19 among 43,000 volunteers got either two doses vaccine placebo. found fewer 10% infections participants given vaccine. 90% cases people given placebo.

It still early stage blown media logistic headache would another problem. cares? Stock price shot up.

And case, Bloomberg quite professional. kind news expected exactly phase III trial.

But sure lots media would happy blow too, especially usual suspects.

Some general subs like world news reddittors much less sane already talking shit.

Reddit really interesting place. Look...walmart already ask employees cover stomachs buttcracks. can't ask cover noses too. isnt Fauci task force? Thermo Fisher called ""spike"" idiot. define ""fine"" differently then. absolute dumbass theory. south got hit hard summer everyone stayed indoors keep cool. north getting hit enter fall, go indoors stay warm. announce dead guy voted new head ND Covid-19 Task force currently good job plus offers unique perspective task force representing recently dead. produce enough vaccine 15 20 million people year. twice next spring?

Right. We're mitigating next winter. winter's gonna grim.  Y’all gotta understand.. like working home now. little bit transition back build teams make friends colleagues get benefits, telework stay. Hahaha chin diaper. Best word far. That's insult genuine failed states fail unintentionally. failing purpose. done big orange dildo held brown shirts rally months ago ya fuckin dunce. say don’t enough long-term studies.

While may fine far that’s anecdotal don’t know causes health problems long-term.

Whenever hear argument anyone anything assume bullshitted. know things gonna go, I'm busy planning things wanna accomplish 2021-2022. 2020 rehearsal 2021; 8-9 months practice living COVID-world, 2021 tackle real deal gave lead time. start 2021 COVID hopefully, 2022 controlled. aftermath lot scary catching virus. T0rrent01, 10pesjidi alt accounts (MoyuSquad, TestNoone) suspended Reddit.

Just extra bit good news following vaccine!  Dry ice works. meant every virus class different. apologize specific. didn’t mean suggest SARS-CoV-2 different MERS, stating different class varicella influenza, measles SARS-CoV-2 transmitted aerosols, different R0 mortality rates. said wrong statistically? ""The less involvement federal government has, better chance actually working people's favor."" - say virtually everything. that's far analogy plays out. somehow think indecent exposure laws analogous public health laws. anything comparable give idea possible long term effects? Case closed. get home safely? sending people states?

Before long neighboring states overwhelmed too, already.

Almost upper midwest upper mountain states pretty bad shape. I've seen stories Idaho, Montana, South Dakota (I think) send patients state. Whatever It’s hard feel hopeful feels like you’re rock bottom. Don’t hard yourself. There’s lot chaos world right now, things change life get better long run. It’s hard see right hindsight 20/20. 20 years might look back realize covid forced us re-evaluate choices better. won’t bad.

You mentioned work hospital. do? is. &lt;3 much love you!! hope get everything wish for!  Schools back normal non hybrid 3-months places Southeast. girls far haven’t missed day since late August.  moment vaccine available public, 90% population immediately go back normal.

It's ""moment."" months long process. That’s lot trust rushed vaccine.  wat test enough minorites? problem lot covid studies. Liberal Party also right wing Australia! Everybody needs close fucking bars, stop assuming everything outdoors okay. controversial comment? still put mask mandate hospitals capacity.... She'd rather kill us resign anything getting shit second wave. gracious someone seen financial data direct many hospital systems across country, COVID horrible financially. Luckily I'm getting help work things slowly starting look up.

How adjust may ask? I'm trying physical activity lately, kinda helps mood. Might buy treadmill peloton later month. plan dropped per headline. delayed. farms infected still culled farms within security zone 7.8km also culled.

The thing changed rushed law requires 3/4 parlament votes. take usual month 1/2 parlament make law. still happening. Swede recently posted somewhere “why people treating covid like worst thing world?”

My reply? “You’re absolutely taking hospitals medical workers granted.” course
Mentioned particularly susceptible demographics medical workers. poor people.  They’re already killing themselves. PTSD, exhaustion, lack funding, staffing, pay. 12 hour shifts full capacity. new narrative Sweden never tried herd immunity first place. whole post comes way brag much better area majority rest country. you. love comment left parent try hard political order get deleted 😆 work major hospital system inpatient pharmacy Massachusetts. Starting today wear eye protection everywhere hospital plus masks. people still getting sick masks realized may transmitting eyes. agree. see part said going start using healthcare workers elective surgery? state shut elective surgery?! CT, elective surgeries became available summer, cases get high enough again, I'm willing bet get shut again! Yup c say this...this title dangerously misleading. First paragraph:

“A safe Thanksgiving pandemic possible, health experts know advice tough swallow dry turkey: Stay home. Don’t travel. must gather, outdoors” hospitals I've worked at, always internal/external disaster. hospital called one March, given all-clear yet.

Basically policies mean fuck anymore, administrators pull bullshit want, including locking doors keeping staff indefinitely. code black blizzard years ago, lived hospital 4 days, working 16 every 24 hours. vaccine take years get us ""herd immunity."" actual hell. Good thing Sweden herd immunity eh? Good thing population definitly wont stubbornly defend horrid strategy bitter end eh? went underfunded school, still learned germs spread. honestly get it, government distrust not, except people really love propaganda. I've estimated 2.8% North Dakotans COVID right now. That's one every 35 people, showing signs slowing down. I've posting r/CovidDataDaily Briefings Tuesday Thursday, number updates Tuesday Friday. Today's press briefing entirely digital first update numbers since Friday.

Notes added below:

* 14-day incidence Sweden 449 per 100.000

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Official links:

* ICU register - FHM official statistic - Socialstyrelsen official statistic based death certificates - SCB preliminary statistics deaths causes - useful links:

* Good visualization information per regions english - ; similar source information intensive care statistics swedish graphs lag information deaths/hospitalization/cases per Another nice website statistical data - twitter account : : keeps updated sheets compare reports previous reports disaggregate data per age regions changes. Ouch. comment read article? pretty clearly says experts asking. If, like me, wondering title actually means, article's summary.

""Covid tests students England, go home safely Christmas, could begin 30 November, according letter universities minister vice chancellors.""  I'm wondering daily death count November 11th. Looks like trending toward Nah trolling good try buddy sounds grossly HIPAA laws. can't take video equipment inside hospital film people. 

My husband nurse hospital talking ""idea"" covid day. eat, sleep, breath covid talk deals daily. hear patients get sent ICU. hear ones die covid. 

I religiously wear mask keep distance people. Even go eat outside, feel comfortable maskless there's table close us. want get covid. lasting, systemic effects body. 

But wondering people family close friends health care workers handle this. direct line someone sees daily. 

Luckily us, we're Connecticut (which one lower case counts, rising). Even hospitals 100%, hospital works always short staffed. gets mandated frequently. Since March 2020, we've get mandatory tests quarantine 2 week periods THREE times possible exposure work (and full ppe cautious, things happen). 

Please take seriously. covid still idea many think pain ass wear mask everywhere, know. ideal. also save lives. want know hospitals doing/nurse life, feel free ask! hope everyone makes good choices keeps safe numbers starting ramp :(. wife would agree this. Shes travel nursing whole year different hospitals pandemic. Indy hit hard early. Rural hospitals seeing alot right bad. said number negative tests coming back insanely low. days negatives. 
Its wonder 5k new cases day How? Stanford? Canada faring Thanksgiving? think they're fully enrolled trial, might able join Novavax later ones. Here's hoping moderate future! sides strong points shortcomings. weekend proof people always going throw another bus best interest, best interest everyone around them.

What awful way start Trump free office. true leftist, I'd ashamed. Again, moderate comes politics think moderate see awful was. :( Yeah I'm sure there's necessarily causative relationship here.  expect half people alive told “they hate us freedom!” like 12 years straight Cloth masks found ineffective whole spectrum aerosol particle sizes especially SARS-CoV-2 virus abundant size range. comment says lot IMO state released plan too. like lockdowns mask mandates, really confidence follow opposition begins. talk see stories japanese people foreign language exchange app deadass lot going events packed. guy posted picture going full arena concert. long start flagellating streets appease God? want full pandemic experience far one done this. patients natural disasters rooms time surprised too. dead people allowed elected, people cast ballots die counted, imo. 

Unless disallow dead people winning elections (and first) people voted count. 

Technically votes matter December anyway. die then? supposed go back undo every vote someone died election official? doubtful. 

Interesting question though. I'm lawyer. guy who's drinking coffee morning. tie highway funding fucking sharia lawesque drinking age. Hi NW Indiana. Little fun fact another RN region: SNFs taking anybody basically ever positive COVID, DME companies capacity us send anybody home 4 liters/minute oxygen. I'm sure already well aware fucked staffing is, low morale fallen.

The region really bad time. GG stupid people take 80-20 rule. Vaccinate 20% vulnerable decrease deaths 80%. sending healthcare workers work covid? leave friends, family, coworkers die. would hope iron Humanity needs invest global group working together non profit eradicate virus threat instantly.
We enough expertise so.
lots permanent options, funding.
All big pharma dont profit permanently treating virus based illnesses.
we need progress humanity. week second shot go get antibody test curious. schedule online LabCorp without even talking someone IRL. Donating organs libz.

Hahaha given n95. places tell use procedure mask acting surprised staff gets sick don’t even need pandemic profitability. moved LA staff nurse received sign bonuses living stipend rivaled travel nurse contracts. year probably accounted two thirds payment (20%) house Orange County. wife’s job (OR) paid much more, accumulated half year alone. 

We basically pooled $150K single year house, pandemic; retention incentives everyone left largest private employer region. wtf get wrong, I'm user Torrent guy! *want* go back normal! know whether government let me. also natural disasters! Rural Wisconsin here, masking joke. People yard signs bumper stickers say “My Governor IDIOT”. know, tried right thing. 
Sure, mask mandate. 50% people don’t adhere still host large gatherings go bar like nothing going on. I’m really starting hate people. Gotta alive pay mortgage. People already thinking virus democrat hoax along due vaccine announced election. News coverage won’t change local leadership refused enforce greater prevention methods.  Almost 90% ohio counties trending right now: http://covid.maxheckel.me/ governor seems like dumbass think folks incredibly hyperbolic standpoint. Old folks need towards front line point plank make sense vaccinate right healthcare workers, ESPECIALLY point efficacy data older populations. Dude, want old people love get vaccinated soon possible. also recognize approach much community health standpoint vaccinating essential workers. don’t like facts subreddit unfortunately.

Honestly, sub contributing lot mental health issues people. It’s healthy doom gloom time. Fixating worse worse covid cases letting frame worldview. saw one today NM 7k week ICU work 60 hour week. suggesting nurses actually getting protective gear need now? live Bismarck. People still call “Plandemic” say go away Trump leaves office?? 

There city wide mandate wear masks implemented weeks ago. one wears repercussions don’t. Minnesotans always bring Wisconsin talking Minnesota? get it. lakes better NFL team. 

We're super fucked COVID though, guess common. hospital CEOs atrocious. know get sick covid likely *from work* must report employee health attendance policy still enforced. Meaning still accrue occurrences result disciplinary action take care sickest patients. disgusting I've read guy got twice second time asymptomatic. dad brother right now. like regular flu thankfully. operation warp speed? Political games. Researchers said incident related vaccine. strains become less deadly issue. issue virus mutating way leads increased transmission severity time system already overwhelmed. Another 1% people becoming seriously ill sound like big deal could straw broke camels back areas like North Dakota already capacity.

At time scale, no. 


You seem doom gloom things completely beyond control. Let burst bubble: 
People die every day. 
Viruses kill people every day. 
Novel viruses come around every day. 


The flu common cold might exact impact early man describe latter part post, adapt new standards new humans generations live circumstances life. evolution pressure is. exactly humanity ""as whole species"" survive COVID.  


Death tragic, also another statistic. Live life, happy, contribute, accept death happens everyone. info this? First I've heard it. literally here, every day. debate disagree, intellects.

You forgot say also downvote *anyone* saying *anything* critical Sweden. Hope get margins! saying they’re lying it. I’m saying exceptions make rule. always outliers data. immune systems work same, people likely produce robust immune response create long-lasting immunity, likely do. That’s data shows us far. single anecdote study. trust CDC scientific institutions this. gather enough data says otherwise, I’ll adjust POV, then, trust direction. lobby. Denmark democracy ruled laws involved worldwide effort stop virus never get full thank credit deserve I'm glad light end tunnel even know names companies people every single one thanks I've taken kinds vaccines, including typically needed developed world. (I doubt vaccinated typhoid yellow fever, have.)

But took years develop.

None launched months clinical trials typically take year performed succession instead simultaneously.

None developed climate intense politicization fear public reaction vaccine.

And no, think COVID-19 cooked Chinese lab. Complete nonsense. That's interesting! dont know guy's story, I'm upper midwest. Bedford. Bedford Hills. Prison. think said needs super cooled dry ice transport, regular freezer lasts like 5 days, demand think see much going bad.

Properly packed dry ice fine 24 hours transport. agree 100%, think got idea anti-fauci first comment downvoted I'm you, friend. blows mind everyone seems fine eating reaturant food.

Politicians busy trying show voters right thing. surge Sturgis motorcycle rally ways back. 500,000 ~~attendees~~ absolute fucking morons, 50% infection rate. scattered back states, are. Really concerned people hear elderly vaccinated period straight away go back normal without realizing two step vaccination immunity coming month later at-risk getting vaccinated mean everyone even are.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Obviously, latter group made wrong decision given Fall Surge, would interested knowing successful mitigation programs colleges resumed in-person classes. right? conducting regular surveillance testing? convert fields stadiums covered lecture halls? ban Greek club activities year? difficult, time consuming. work bar/restaurant industry basically every bartender server job right now. pivot take you, need one person handing orders, instead several servers, bartenders, bussers. Citywide, that’s ridiculous amount jobs. 

The bigger problem there’s almost coordination government restaurant association, many times state says one thing changes mind. open streets first started restaurants put barricades expand outdoor seating. two weeks later, city released new guidelines required barricades everyone tear start again.

It's like want *deny* credit work straight-up

Are sociopath? Yes, restrications would perhaps saved people. then, didnt' shut last year? next year? every year? 

Locking society likely always cause less vulnerable people die. question whether worth it/what measurs reasonable. Honestly, sounds like fucking AI wrote - upvotes!? almost certain pfizer trying hard find specialized manufacturing plants produce vaccine. Yesterday's positive results mean company enough orders make good profit. faster produce it, money making competition come. Imagine living without restaurants! natural!

/s Fauci, I've read interviews health experts who've talked low risk covid transmission via food. Stomach acid kills virus. bigger risk transmission containers - although risk lower initially thought. However, really worried, transfer everything different container, wash hands well. mean every 2 weeks, dont know Pay wall. mean, *would* nice. concern early pandemic thought virus spreading surfaces. Gas pumps icky people get large virus bacteria load. I've always sanitized using pump worry getting sick one. stinky, occasion.

Obviously mask go inside building use loo. one reasons NZ careful pacific islands time. don’t want spread corona islands. 

Interestingly enough, coworker Samoa. Grandmother oldest “the replacements” term given children born influenza outbreak. 

Her Grandmother 8th child, first born flu, none survived.  world must think? I’m saying shouldn’t care. I’m recognizing reality. doesn’t matter factual evidence provide with, it’s conspiracy Donny. Unfortunately, figure different way. Like, weave mythical web lies deceit conspiracy, it’s actually real life. rest us give ole wink wink nod nose touch. Idk, great Tupac Shakur said:

Full grown adults need approval people even know feel accomplished, that's people low self esteem lack real achievements strive for. want squeaky clean pharmaceutical company, might well go back using leeches.

If works, works. anti-American you!

Sad /s Thanks pdf warning think it’s 60% get vaccinated point exactly? Chinese government slaughtered thousands innocent people streets 1989. people get China’s vaccine avoid giving CCP good publicity? Well 40 million people losing pre existing condition coverage going break insurance Especially Biden office uses defense production act. Get Ford/GM/Chrysler start churning refrigerated trucks dry ice containers like B-52s D-Day. haven’t paid much attention COVID news while. lot world spiking significant number people tested positive spring getting virus second time? still seem rare people diagnosed COVID twice? I'm guessing governor north dakota nurse office hospital right?

WE NEED TWO DAKOTAS!!!! Ah, course. Thanks reality check. become infected it’ll mild infection. death rate plummet even risk groups. 

you see exact thing flu vaccine. even still get flu it’s lot less severe you’re sick days rather 2 weeks. kidding. wear coat! Drinking beer wearing coat really limiting quality life!

Also prefer anything group ten people more! Seeing friends 1on1 awkward! need least 8 people feel like human being! natural!! imagine kicked hospital asshat bothered wear mask take proper precautions? 

You're hard time breathing now? literally signed ignoring science, broken leg man go home early, risking knows what, including improper healing maybe forcing lifelong limp, selfish behavior. 

So frustrating. phrase nobody could predicted this... 9/11 sucker punch basic public health much like rove screwing katrina  vaccine stupidity?  feel need negative?  impacted shutting elective surgeries infant 2 months. well want hospitals maxed due Covid. spike protein present mutations. key.

I'm going try sound smarter subject would love think people investing hundreds millions dollars thing thought this........... hope lol like limited doses start. There's many essential workers would love shot get rid stress. probably right. I'm jaded lackluster response US. I’m really sure qualms are?

Are scientific breakthroughs negated amount time took develop them? something done faster doesn’t mean it’s safe valid. 

Most vaccines take long time develop due relevancy, funding issues trials normally take longer, however; scientists usually like 99% certainty rate safe/effective vaccine within first year. way Denmark test whole population sequence every single test. needed see strain dead not. Yes, science works. Anecdotes ≠ data.

* start informal observation
* make hypothesis
* collect data
* compare data hypothesis determine true false.
* point adjust hypothesis collect data required. ""winning"" yet? I'm sure live, use Northeast case study. 100% wrong, unequivocally.

NY, NJ, got absolutely wrecked COVID first, July spread nearly nonexistent. takeout April on, batch eased restrictions late summer/early fall (indoor dining, business types open, increased capacity, SCHOOLS, etc.) numbers increased. [There single piece data indicates COVID significantly transmitted prepared all. 

What call gluttony actually simply consumerism completely normal behavior cultures people money afford it. also supports service industry, massive part tourism economy, extremely safe easy way support local businesses. 

So yes, call people ""fat"" ordering takeout, especially pandemic, come like douche. medicine right it’s called air breath may may help treat covid. covid goes away don’t forget give credit. Religion designed around controlling women.  often think /r/fitness realizes there's ends working involve gaining lot muscle. many variables, another redditor one Nordic cultures said s/he believe same, cultures quiet (they also physical distance like masters that's confounder). flip side, seems ""loud"" cultures like Italy, Spain, Brazil etc saw faster average rates spread. one example saturated market psychological ""studies"" exist solely r/Coronavirus coronabros get direct vitriol ""wrong kind people"" hide behind supposed science. thought too, keeps happening different thermometers year year. I’ve accepted point. Article says license suspended. long? meaningful consequences, encourage others country club did.  Yea arent talking pre exisiting health? People clearly gave zero fucks health demanding everyone protects virus wouldnt hurt went jog week. fucking stupid. No, think deserve him. yes, protect given right-wing scumbags made death threats family. disagree? Thanks President Trump  According preprint Danes published, variant hasn’t detected since September, Denmark sequences 14% detected cases. don’t want make pronouncements, could well disappeared wild. would taken variant spreading slightly less well dominant strain. I'd say ""Florida vibe"" rubbed slightly.

Wouldn't say gone full ""Florida-mode""... less strict say, am. that's necessarily big deal.

We set-points... there's lot room ""doing everything possible slow spread"" ""doing nothing"", long least steps ""doing nothing"" especially belittle more, figure people co-exist. Username checks going argue that, definity expensive. It’s good treat yoursef within reason mental health. that’s really enjoy splurging could see caring. correct I’m wrong isn’t pfizer thing good news? People saying “yeah average person get vaccine 2021 there’s enough doses 600 million people” pfizer vaccine two dose vaccine, however, isn’t pfizer one many companies developing one? People acting like pfizer vaccine one coming out. Username checks unique long term health concerns. remember went gym usual early March right week shut down, thinking wiped everything would fine. Seems like lifetime ago. good home workout routine can’t see going back gym even vaccines etc here. hell 99% wearing masks? Explosion= Release energy(the thing see)+shockwave(blast)

The release energy size would rapid growth infections.

The total carnage means people drop dead street like Italy first wave.  means infection rate got high would like seeing release energy H-Bomb close try run away(trying something pandemic late) shockwave gets ands burns alive. 

Italy regions overwhelmed really cruel see recordings people dropping dead streets doctors deceided gets ventilator gets sedated suffer much dying.

Even 1% death rate consider everybody USA gets infected that's 3.3million deaths. 10% serious cases that's 33million unpredictable aftereffects. Let's say one third dies next cold dies life expectation got shortened lot. That's 11million deaths short timeframe.

Added that's 14.3 million deaths Covid example ideal scenario health care system overwhelmed. overwhelmed health care system adds quiet hospitalisation level cases without ventilator list serious/deadly cases left untreated.

Without taking action pandemic become ugly Spanish flu everybody become asympomatic. can't teach EAT PROPERLY home, stop  Claim based what? Maybe thermometer. pretty inaccurate always high/low.

But temp. sometimes goes sick indeed weird. People get good private school city bad schools. People can’t get rural area. 

And arrogant, “Take leave it” attitude, that’s actually reality. idea think is. plenty doctor jobs non-rural areas - it’s matter “take rural job take nothing.” 

Rural areas incentivize this, they’ve done various ways. Several rural states (Kansas others) Rural Doctors Programs, state pays certain portion med school loan debt exchange doctors agreeing work rural areas certain number years. Specific rural hospitals sometimes worked raise money provide incentives doctors. it’s “here nothing” deal. Lots doctors sign Weatherby Vista another locum staffing company bounce around various locum gigs agree really rural gig. Thank clearing up--But that's still leaves 863 new deaths, that's US equivalent 4300 new deaths, terrible--The good news new virus cases today huge drop days ago  chance figure positivity rate yet, know they're good. Last heard 8% 9%. blame them? cant claim "" health emergency "" lasts fucking year end hundred thousand died. Thats fucking crisis. Theres 350 million people here. Don’t trust won’t taking testing! Numbers stalled UK...still high day though. Fingers crossed begins go soon! read realistic timeline estimations vaccine distribution? i.e. it'll safe get together packed cinema enjoy concert... Numbers up... Management made happen. Numbers down.... lower level employees arent productive enough. gonna fire themselves. Damn... really hope contain virus fast enough germany help european neighbours... 

Feels like enough capacity help deal virus ourself... I’m nj, cooperate?  Source claim safe!

You too. alarming /s Dude long youre fits political agenda risk acceptable. Source this? believe they'd give us  Damn you....take upvote. That's basically mindset. However little worried wife getting vaccination. IVF nurse New York State. worries got pregnant get vaccinated. I'm kind person gets nervous Tylenol so... Good luck! Stay safe. forget burden short long term disability mental health problems! 2021 looking completely different 2020, yes start probably same, get year, Pfizer, Moderna, Oxford, J&amp;J producing distributing vaccine.


By March/April 2021, first world countries enough Vaccines considered widely available, next summer/ fall, first world countries probably look pretty normal, probably wont see huge concerts summer 2022 many concerts happen winter.

I think make winter home stretch towards normalcy. buy Joe beer Joe says ""we-are-cyborgs paid beer!"", feel need point beer actually paid employer? Funny done say prove Pfizer said part Warp Speed. 

Sad find reality politicized. - feel bad, flippant unhelpful comment me. Stay safe, hopefully starts get better soon. idea talking to. I'm socialist. Go suck capitalist's dick. I've eaten fried food fine. Maybe oil use. really liked tho stomach didn't. someone infected Sturgis infected 3-4 people thats typical covid positive person takes weeks spike fully realized. town cancelled non-critical stuff springtime well order prepare wave Covid.

But wave never came. 

So .. I'm sure thing now? long immunity last?

They say 90% effective seven days second dose. sounds like second dose 3-4 weeks first dose.

So protected 5-6 weeks?

That's much. Hmm.. sure. Okay. “Data in: masks either hurt seem make difference,” said Rep. Scott Allen, R-Waukesha, press release flagging “the large growth COVID-19 positive tests since mandate put place late July.”

What kind death cult say ignorant shit like that? think everyone knows. wish could wear N95 mask sadly no. wear cloth mask. fuck get someone who’s life actually matters? Enough America one ally Well that's busy time. 2am 4am queues go way street.  Yeah, small company 2-3 Middle managers. actually coming right president.

It's absolutely COVID related. Stores carry products closing left right online sales make difference.

Actually compared retail companies right well. happy that. Every staffed bed full.

That’s it’s calculated.

Hospitals get full, it’s something happens, go divert, issue bulk Midwest divert.

You go staffed capacity hours, prolonged staffed capacity leads errors lower level care. Get job Frank hear you. sent home days ago someone office family member it. (Why quarantined?) came work started developing symptoms.  went home could ""sanitize"", back next day. also fully capable working home.  

Stay safe! Hm. got email school district last week saying Superintendent going making announcement Wednesday, well. supposed middle high school only, wonder. inhale close range low temperature, yes.
Otherwise, think so. problem -- realize many people think ""Science"" set answers big book somewhere hard tell sometimes. :) friend election celebrations. read story stomach acid, also, studies showing virus influenced acid would enzymes.

The risk likely stomach, chewing creating aerosols, swallowing throat lined tissue replicates extremely well.

Also, problem workers speaking food, creates large droplets extreme amounts virus. Therefore, consider packaging major risk, food itself. think scientists anti-lockdown? something sold $39, $39 revenue, margin. rest victims felt deserved right way?  people pop kids going make zero effort zero fucks? It’s decent meal better cook gone simple cheap ingredients like 10x price. example get tri tip 13 dollars make rice veggies comes 17 dollars feed like 8 people like 2 dollars head.  restaurant charge minimum 15 dollars cheapest thing including tip taxes. one dinner equivalent 8 tri tip home cooked meals.  economics don’t make sense, regardless afford delivery fee wut allowed to, people website Pfizer: ""The Phase 3 clinical trial BNT162b2 began July 27 enrolled 43,538 participants date, 38,955 received second dose vaccine candidate November 8, 2020."" 

""Based current projections expect produce globally 50 million vaccine doses 2020 1.3 billion doses anyone curious learning vaccines, would strongly recommend listening episode Star Talk. talks Covid-19 vaccine process comes about.

ITT: People assuming sterilising immunity vaccinated people cannot spread disease. awful lot people US, ""Christian"" means ""something people social tribe would/should do"". (They're treating Christianity less religion per se social in-group. *ONE US!*) agree ""faithful"" ""brave"" might better terms apply broadly, think lot /u/PhorcedAynalPhist 's intended audience would reject terms reason. live COVID life long complications...

Have famous people got Covid ended life-long complications? take along 2 kids sleeping. Good know another potential benefit. went sold sovereign nations including US standard going rate, really wash *only* reason take money, suggested reasons (like fact Pfizer NEVER produced vaccine risky experimental one worried might get bad PR flub it), seems like could also played decision calculus.


I'm sure reasons well, imagine one major ones working/reporting Trump admin. see giving money without terms like US only. think would worse PR move, obviously Trump admin wildly unpopular/polarizing parts world. argument resort toddler like behavior since don’t social environment spur forward something. Wouldn’t surprise considering complex people are. Yo ur parents teach something, thing confirmed see friends also thing. point stance is, get vaccine, done worrying last group get vaccine, 19 male that's really healthy preexisting conditions.


If dont get vaccine dont trust something, really dont care health point, stay inside rest life, dont care, I'm going go live life. think Swedish?

The swedes replied comment critical Sweden's policies. 

Just saying see. Lemme fix headline you: ""Lockdown parents get lazy""


Both young kids virtual school year. ideal, they're *learning* *growing*. plus grandparents dead! Cool emotional outburst based lies. Textbook liberal. drones. Someone r/Fitness subreddit made argument. retort peanut gallery ""Show us chicken legs.""

There's substitute golden five. don’t know, fucking love shit probably not? 🤷🏽‍♂️ they’re fried chicken wings, they’re supposed greasy. Would say profession dictated community needs most? worst part people lying getting vaccinated still taking masks off. full one worked nothing later late. partial one yeah crap. wouldn’t FEMA write check North Dakota?

Because writing checks months. 

The pay offered emts. basic life support emt's paid base rate 45/hr. ""strong union"" rules hours overtime. ( Folks usually took home less 1k week awesome week , seeing 3 , 4 5k weeks.

There plenty financial incentive 8 months latter. Cheer up! It'll grow back! No, actually. don’t. wonder many commute New Zealand another country. Tried google came nothing. People complain powerful got first everyone else wait. don’t think long term data mRNA vaccines. Where’s authoritarianism????????? others could too. target protein. equating GDP funding made available hire medical workers. Medical care largely inelastic need. nothing lockdowns recessions.  Oh sorry thought french. Yeah ""freedom"" though. Merica!

/s boyfriend wedding band based philly. He’s small number weddings they’ve outside 50 people less. managing pull 120 person wedding???

If wouldn’t go either. I’d trying convince boyfriend money isn’t worth risk....as much needs work.

Edit: weddings outside philly. thought entire state still allowed gatherings 50 less (outdoors). wrong? Bill gates spent disgusting amount money sweeping patents stop anyone American big pharma’ing vaccine. I'm currently basic outdoor emergency care class right ski patrol. nurse 6 years many different critical care specialties recently ER. amazing difference assessment triaging skills vs non medical professional class. skills take years master. much oxygen bad along multitude things. Same. I've slowly building home gym since March think I'll ever buy gym membership again. also lucky enough start buying weights Craigslist March people start quadrupling price rusted iron weights 80s. mismatched set weights all, weights weights. I’m really trying get hopes high... damn I’m excited thought pandemic ending. imagine day get shot(s) makes incredibly emotional. can’t thank everyone contributed science enough, mention people responsible logistics distribution entire operation. You’re hard work given people glimmer. Guys I’m freaking out. COVID-19 fine I’ve seeing lot online long term damage lunges heart brain. anyone know chances this? want live long healthy life! work physically demanding job, go gym, love sports. freak disease going take away me? chances damaged lunges, increased chance heart failure, stroke? Sorry sounding frantic I’m really scared! that's actually boring fascinating again

i even know payload saw acquaintance mine (in US) DESTINATION wedding Mexico last weekend! believe anyone would selfish, I'm shocked many people attended. RNA vaccines. far know widespread RNA vaccines moment means isn’t long term testing revolutionary new type vaccine. Nah: that’s Country Western lyric 👍 ""it happen us"" That's beyond stupidity. People like charged assault talking someone's life here. 200 people surveyed 1 day that's it. scientific always find weird people freak that. people worried random government official seeing porn? I'm pretty sure that's normal them. I'm looking terrorist organizations trying make bombs. Nothing hide here. random person never meet knows search history. Uh oh. Wait, thought America country ~~with issues related Covid19~~? See Pfizer's CEO's statement Sept. 16, referenced article. want politicize science. Except Gates others made virtually impossible ANYONE America try ones managed make virus. trying ensure it’s made America isn’t American Healthcared kill thousands more. Dr Fauci waiting FDA's approval rather jumping get it.

Can describe way one would get vaccine otherwise, trial? like set hotdog carts full vaccines FDA approves it. really feel people living parts world Covid taken hold. disaster. friends following data gave test numbers. makes sense anymore. we're relying death numbers even messy count report separately hospital care centers deaths. days close 1000 others close 500. Today believe 800 deaths reported. person chooses get vaccine, that’s them. aren’t going permanently live masks social distancing placate anti vaxxers. ... friends family better must love them.  Taking comfort knowing 🍊🥔 way new leader briefed pandemic even declared winner. Hearing say plan listen scientists brought fucking legit tear eye. I'm sure why. company plans keeping good chunk us home even over. 

It's become apparent asses seats old school way thinking longer required. Hooray, ifr 0.5 instead 0.6 % :P believe Biden Harris mentioned implementing financial transaction tax help offset costs year. Fortunately, FTT directly tax average person. However, sure corporations figure trickle us. I’m pretty sure Smith never pulled tooth, I’m also close Smith guess it’s possible. think they're counting person's arm too. Approximately 420,000 Americans died 5 years WW2. 50% figure dead US less year still appears people aren’t taking seriously? know anyone mentioned Michigan yet, we're hot mess. one worst country beginning, getting 200 cases statewixe per day back June, seeing average 4000 cases per day, sometimes 5000 6000.

Everythings rising many people longer taking things seriously. lot whole ""I'm sick dealing covid business, can't stop living life"" bullshit. Jam packed restaurants definitely 100% capacity, parties every weekend, everyone going crowded places time. lot social distancing going sure. 

I'm glad live area people wearing masks, still SOOOO many people noses out. 🙄🙄🙄

I'm careful can, I've already exposed (was negative thankfully) know matter time accidentally get exposed thru family something. 

It's really scary time wish people would take things seriously. You’re anti vaxxer FDA approve don’t take it, even without comment Dr. Fauci. think health minister. know worldmeters backlogs; seem show bulk testing numbers Slovakia. case war drugs :) either pro vaccine pro people dying between. things black white trying say grey classic antivaxxer yactic Pfizer producing Belgium already. Lockdowns don’t work hope remember flippant attitude glib comments like someone love ends hospital dead recklessness. Behaving like that, it’ll matter time I’m sure. saddest part doesn’t way, choice consciously made. 

I would call ignorant, actually access information need make correct decisions still choose to. guess makes idiot. 3/42 lot infections matter count it. Either there's massive outbreak going there, people somehow thought immune started treating patients PPE, vulnerable infection several weeks vaccination. Same. could mRNA mean curing common cold herpes aids etc? C'mon man get high horse. live tiny cramped apartment neighbors can't super intense impact workouts. Besides that, us exercise crucial way relieve stress/anxiety, something that's all-time high 2020. Sure could go run summer, soon it'll freezing live.

My gym requires masks (and unlike restaurant actually keep mask entire time working out), temperature checks door, gives everyone spray bottle wipes clean equipment use, set air filtration systems every floor, go lunch hour there's maybe 15-20 people entire three-floor gym.

Sure, lot gyms going far, borderline rude throw around much attitude anyone who's trying exercise. also talked gym's manager day since reopened August single member notify they've contracted covid. Even surprised that, goes show effective masks common sense setting.

It also depends live. Everyone around super compliant comes mask-wearing, even outdoors people generally reckless. lol getting paid something? obsessed? know America still it’s first wave right?  Love neither person photo wearing mask.../s case. Drive almost completely safe unless sitting chatting person window 5 minutes.

Otherwise, really matter inside, norovirus. Lol Philadelphia 844 cases today

We're selfish, South African, Canadian, multiple small businesses owner hoping start EMT degree Canada January, I'd hate conversation taxes. XD (What saying mental health? What's best society? 🙄) Thanks.

I see mostly batches recalled manufacture problem, extreme caution (which nice). 

The two proved problematic vaccines last 50 years seem 1976 swine flu vaccine 1998 rotavirus vaccine. love masks. distinguishes nutty right-winger anti-maskers. article primarily third world countries. can’t exactly work remotely there’s careful people already living crowded less sanitary conditions. don’t think covid spreading third world countries people reckless parties. mention masks, trivial US third world countries- need able clean reusable ones harm good, need constant supply disposable ones.

So guess don’t understand comment relates particular article. That’s bad, laugh: apt. see flaw this, reception would bad underground lair... u sure it’s large apartment? lOnG wInTeR **Danish gasser entered chat. looking euromomo becomes increasingly evident countries europe really registered noticeable excess mortality western ones (spain, france, benelux). even oh-so-hard hit italy covid barely registers twice bad 2017 flu.

are theories even attempt explain this? afaik covid strain western europe, countries like france, spain, belgium UK register huge excess mortalities, countries comparable pretty much every aspect like germany, switzerland, austria eastern european countries not? youre saying eating coronavirus less risk breathing? wondered  funnier picture face! showed new dentist yelled OMG! (I think thought look normal) look like Kim Jung now. laughing crying day long Eat rich. Except maybe don’t, they’re full botox preservatives.  Health managed states Australia too. IMHO ultimately costly - - 650K deaths USA over. 

3-5 people less productive, less happy, consuming medical resources 6 months to...to...how many years? know. able work? Play? Enjoy life? Covid going raise IQ average American time said 10 15 points. know shades exist, black white? Broaden horizons see past narrow point view.  stupid questions. 

And actually, think question really interesting one. would like know it, tbh. scientist interested concept mRNA vaccine (which follow BioNTech's progress bit), well, mostly want know solution pandemic could look like discovered concept mRNA vaccine. 

There [press BioNTech mentions it. subjects prime-boost cohorts, except two lowest dose level, CD4+ cell responses. Cytokine profiling RBD-specific CD4+ cells demonstrated TH1-dominant profile cells. 29 36 tested subjects also mounted RBD-specific functional, **CD8+ cell response comparable memory responses** observed cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) **influenza data suggested BNT162b1 could potentially administered safely, manageable tolerability profile. **Local reactions systemic events injection BNT162b1 dose levels transient, generally mild moderate, occasional severe events (Grade 3) flu-like symptoms injection site reactions**. adverse events resolved spontaneously managed simple measures. serious adverse events (SAEs) reported, withdrawals due adverse events related vaccine.

I can't tell much functioning immune system. BNT says comes memory effect body T-Cells get created. likely need actual Scientist answer. never thought much reading TH1, CD4 CD8 thought okay long explanation. probably good point follow rabbit hole. knowledge immune system, T-Cells etc. big since working another field. true! I'd careful. releasing world minimal short term testing long term testing all. Personally I'll letting others guineapigs.

Just food thought. gathering people risky days, become crystal clear. see T'giving different. First all, vaccine 100% effective. infect thousand, hundred people may still get COVID might actually die. hard justify that.

Except going give vaccine hundreds millions, premise protect them. many tens thousands hundreds thousands exposed virus, likely throw caution wind (ie mask, social distancing, etc) thinking they're safe. worse?

I'm saying making bold claims 90% effectiveness based small sample size statistically randomized trial dangerous. asthma I'm worried ramifications posted somewhere else. bunch research it. 


TLDR: documented cases, although appears rare point. Main concerns are: long immunity last (unlikely forever since RNA virus (these mutate way DNA viruses, could become immune maybe certain people), could get sicker get second time (maybe?) different strains (appears thankfully seem extremely different.
--------------------------------------------------------
Certainly seems like happening, albeit point relatively rare. concern regards get (especially vaccine comes); COVID mutate immunity wane point? viruses like smallpox give lifelong immunity it. Given COVID-19 novel virus know enough yet. 

Along lines, admitting know enough yet, anecdotally speaking physicians reading literature, might chance mild infection initially could portend chance serious infection get second time (the recent case 25 year old Nevada man hospitalized oxygen second infection example). However, given paucity significant volume data hard determine that.

COVID RNA virus (other type viruses DNA); RNA viruses inherently prone mutations. thankfully seem like COVID mutated lethal disease, seem different variants pretty similar slight differences (not necessarily important seems symptoms one may lead to, moreso could make susceptible reinfection get different variant first infection). Notably, HIV RNA virus small subset people ~10% completely immune it. 
""A study posted September 28 medRxiv confirms four reinfections Qatar using genetic sequencing data found distinct viral variants first second infections.""

Have spoken physician colleagues they've personally seen instances (although ton) people re-infected COVID (eg positive test, separated negative tests period weeks likely months later another positive test symptoms).

""These findings suggest patient infected SARS-CoV-2 two separate occasions genetically distinct virus.

I’ve never wait 18 hours result. Granted, places longer wait times, it’s possible reason suspect covid. understand wearing mask infringes freedom? mask mandate state makes things normally did- shop, gas up, eat restaurants. Things need totally shut enough people following logical precautions. 

I miss eating inside restaurants gets colder less outdoor eating becomes available, keeping outside dining heaters.

But freedom? feel pretty free healthy breathing mask-wearing. California almost schools closed governor orders, prevented many people leaving homes. live border town Mexico. child, family went visit US aunt's vehicle. Minutes crossing border, told us buckle could get ticket.

Isn’t 2-3 percent death rate absolute ceiling hospitals overrun? Indiana shit hole. husband there. even visit. Maybe someday again. cannot now.

Yeah. lockdowns immunity common cold viruses dropping. immune system God given PPE”

God also created medical professionals epidemiologists say otherwise.

Then again, god also created coronavirus. wicked sense humor. title misleading. applies hospitals *overall* 100% capacity. isnt true. state's goal maintain 20% limit hospitalized people covid reaching. currently 383 people currently hospitalized covid ND. dont total 383 beds.

This headline 100% distilled fearmongering Exactly. Instead ""no evidence of""s need ""evidence not""s. mention clear rampant propagandism lack proper education leads people labeling things like wearing mask Communist.

It's gotten real bad. There's solid probably 30% country that's completely brainwashed anti-science point claim contrary smacked immediately, people interest learning even hearing argument. also people refuse get vaccinated whenever get one got ""alien DNA make us gay"" shit.

US population course advantage achieving immunity significant portion population already exposed, may 25% densely populated areas account anti-vax’ers rate distribution effective rate may likely go non-controlled settings. delay timeline getting society wide immunity.

Tennessee here. couple weeks ago posted small county things going full steam ahead, parades celebrations scheduled pretty much every weekend christmas. two homecoming events, Halloween, week theres going huge veterans day parade.

In pictures events FB, people crammed shoulder shoulder masks sight. Halloween saw huge parties. masks. Nobody wears masks anywhere. Ever.

And like said post couple weeks ago numbers going up. went 10-15 new cases day 70+ cases. two schools involved homecomings closed due many people out. said yesterday many contact trace. They, again, coming close guidelines moving virtual learning. However, last two times nearing line, changed reporting metrics rather move virtual. 

Our little hospital long sending people Nashville according read yesterday, Nashville starting look good hospital front. little county one hospital sending people Nashville.

In short, give time we're going hot mess. hotter mess. would too. Lots people perfectly healthy short breath afterward able take full breaths minor amounts exercise. 

I say ICU none really bad patients asthmatics. slight reassurance. :( best luck stay safe. trying get hopes up, also remember Moderna’s CEO saying expect vaccine efficacy rate high too. I’m hoping multiple vaccines reach Pfizer’s level. expecting much Oxford though. wish New Englanders would start wearing masks. They're hopeless Damn, hits hard. Right?

They might make second break room second call room special bathrooms. that’s big might. even going sustained close contact staff.  8 months pandemic still clue talking lol weren’t awaiting results. idea There's freedom, there's much freedom.

Excuse me!? nobody ever thought measles-level infectious, anywhere close that. like everything’s burning there’s fire everywhere answer keep hard work, yet, government asked worry people hard work (you know, maybe pass Bill) decided put standby go vacation see panned out. makes lot sense fire. 
But know sure actually case here! 

It might well case, there's data that. also really plausible. there's *some* data supporting still unclear if, extend, plays role. young 79 years old. Yup, meme years complaining obnoxious relatives dinner table.  entitled opinion. private profit hospital systems grow even bigger prices increase more. I’m overseeing another phase 3, subjects asked continue lives would weren’t study. want mimic real life much possible, choose purposefully expose themselves, (but certainly suggested bc could gotten placebo), want wear mask, can. act normal. Or, know, asymptomatic not, get treatment rest heal human beings. Also, unbelievably stupid working increases chances people hospital contracting COVID. yet cases fairly flat masks barely restrictions, Illinois carries rising despite masks restrictions

I wonder learn Sadly already occurring. bill passed healthcare workers required paid quarantining. Also we’re heavily guilted well. direct exposure asymptomatic expected come in. forgive taking Brazil seriously, hard trust Jail Borsorryass. No. Swedish state media government downplaying it. Swedes anything. see threads. Swedish reddit users spontaneously started resistance movement science reason. world world wrong, Tegnell nothing wrong. 

Most populations know governments bad corrupt. Even North Koreans do. Swedes stay denial end. Sweden culture debate. Sweden intellectuals. hard disagree. go N.D. month late summer family medical emergency. lack concern COVID mind-boggling. Bars restaurants packed.  Kid's football soccer games family members packed like sardines mask sight. Needless say, I'm surprised what's going there. think meant funny-ironic, funny-funny. 1) worst vaccine side effects usually happen injection immediately
2) multiple scientists come said mink mutation near non issue comes vaccine effectiveness 

We’re going keep turning keep dry ice 2-5 days. going problem perverse idea freedom . need revisit educating people Social contract society people grasp causing everything fall apart.  

The social contract philosophical myth, objective thing agree exists. Even less likely people agree implicit contract exists also agree terms. 

""Educating"" people sounds awful lot like patriotic education Trump suggests. 

I agree rest. clear, need believe non consensually bound terms nature birth believe harm people. Well, duh. know this. good validated research. Yeah, long-term reinfections. Covid unpredictable I'd venture say 1/5 people general developed mental illness become aware since coronavirus started, much doom dread person take.. add entire political situation social unrest usa, exactly hard see coming from.  You’re assuming Pfizer one manufacturing vaccine. You’re thinking AZ, Novavax, J&amp;J, Moderna, Sanofi....

You’re also assuming there’s ramp production then.....

You’re also assuming countries world producing vaccines likely covering countries surrounding countries (Russia, India, China).. places cover words population.

You also don’t account therapeutics exist successful getting people better, like regeneron Lilly, supplement get sick....

You don’t account fact there’s 350 million people USA. Children don’t really need vaccinated. People choose vaccinated. right like 220 million vaccinate.

Start healthcare/vulnerable/old... lockdowns POOF... gone. shit kicked end Q2 next year NA Europe. 10?  Holy shit.  result incompetence. GOP plan. Equal 124,168 US cases trending last days vaccine two-shot series. 1.3 billion doses ends enough 650 million people. already shortage. going make next years rough

Might campaign get people interested becoming nurse understand tight race state vote count close (like within thousand) could determine outcome election, recount valid. 

Agreed. Nevada stands, that's good enough. over. “for every COVID-19 death prevented, 80 children may die lack routine vaccination”

“If save ONE life worth it” - Rich westerners March homeschool kids, hoping squash curiosity, they'll grow sane thoughtful impact world around them. pain irradiates head. got kind cash laying around pack move another state whim? pissed away 10 grand kids could get Arizona massive numbers ""muh freedumb"" anti-maskers.

They're lucky daddy could help, I'm sure lot people places able that. Flying cabo friends vacation today! Sue me. thing even close anything worry 50 move better state. Lots places need staff right It’s great, deploying logistics nightmare deploy it. needs kept -80 degrees Celsius need two shots. aren’t goi g rolling local pharmacy get it. FUCKING GENEROUS HIM!!! hear that, sick nurses? get keep working!!

UP EM!!!  means 12 infected since start pandemic. check link get number cases per million population 13th list. Government care anymore. people tell scam joke. Wtf  education. Hmm heard somewhere before. I'm sure great idea though. grant normalcy spring probably optimistic, summer 2022 hilariously far off.

I'm 48. Trust me, summer '22 hilariously far off. 

Think it. takes 6-8 months really build vaccine infrastructure, means we'll done time starts getting cold '21. 

So again, we'll able mitigate winter '21/'22 winter '20/'21 gonna grim. US LONG that. 

It's never going away. ten year old right now, lives 80, I'm guessing catch least 5-10 times lifetimes. like now, common cold, bug stay. chance ever eradicated. None. 

By way, old guy, I'm pretty salty lockdowns. I've kept shape. Obesity elephant room, I'm rocking decent v-taper. fear damned bug. locked others pitiable shape? Bah! Also worth remembering study sample increases effectiveness likely decrease stabilize still remain high hope fails tRump can't put name 🙄 Except lmfao.

God gonna great seeing smug ass Swedes get fucked again. Cant wait.

I'd recommend shut up, history isnt kind people defending mass homocide :). Plus maybe shut stopped defending horrid way country acted people wouldnt fucking hate recive less vitrol.

Just advice :). Wait India government saying scam? thought serious it? X thing good idea, I’ll bring up! fair, work critical care.

My colleagues knew march thing would go time.

The truth SOCIETY bunch babies can't follow rules, things we've done far would never really helped much. 

Remember whole ""flatten curve "" topic. honest could get. never going ""beaten"" stopped.

Countries bed capacity something spreads like this. picks old infirm, which, due modern medicine stockpiled several generations  shoulder shrug rather real conversation.

The current outcomes expected. sigh, doctors nurses walk job.......can't say blame going terrible thing... Can't wait finally one mink farm spread new coronavirus stain. Thats useless anectode. Yes course doctors like lifestyle. always exceptions overall trends whatever want call it. fact is, enough doctors nurses want work rural areas. Thats debate. fact. death rate low...we 3k deaths day since rates gone almost 3 times much letting everyone know man Twitter office phone number it’s easy find. recommend letting know feel Let’s see, 7 billion people, two doses each... it. big pharma enemy long ago lol? Funny tables turned. guess pandemic PR needed. Well rate deaths going, lot fewer vaccines going needed pointstohead.jpg use statistical calculations figure minimum data pool reliable results. 100 people big pool infection rates (but useful something like testing rare-cancer drug). 40,000 plenty large enough infectious disease.

The main purpose trial like prove vaccine reduces infection and/or severity general population.  addition catching severe side effects may occurred smaller trials.

If 20k people get placebo, 20k people get vaccine, randomized double blinded even docs administering shots know got what, track gets Covid-19. Say find 100 cases couple months 10 vaccine pool 90 fom placebo pool. (They test everyone catch even asymptomatic cases). It’s obvious vaccine preventing significant number infections. 1 10 infections vaccine group severe, 25 90 placebo infections severe, would also indicate vaccine reduces severity addition preventing infection.

The vaccine may turn less effective various populations, different age categories, among people specific health conditions, that’s kind thing use larger studies for. general effectiveness use smaller pool. Life threatening? regular flu worse 99.9% people survive covid, stop fear mongering! news said next year phizer make 635 million doses next year kinda hope can. really need coroner mark dead database. they're bought investors rent back us. sisters coworker died within 3 days testing positive. 38 years old. 

This “freedoms”, America. Stay safe, hopefully avoid carriers around you. know nurse works veterans association caught big rona. sister nurse NICU thankfully negative quite coworkers infected. Everyone way 😡 question morality much logic; young people work more, less money use public transport etc.

Simply way society works, young able spread virus more, may break rules flippantly/blatantly, many spreading virus trying make ends meet.

I'm saying simple solutions, easy saying ""old folk get shot first"" hoping for, people expecting 70% effective, FDA required 50-60% effective, 90% effective miracle, bodes well vaccines like Moderna, Oxford, J&amp;J also high efficacy. Give instructions two steps:

Please step onto X. (Mark ground)

Now, please switch mask. lol um no. general federal government brings states line threatening funding. case POTUS emergency powers public health reasons. trump use want try *and fail* Physician here: busy I'm legitimately considering giving catheter strapping bag leg.

However, big show - Superbowl Sunday (not confused /r/Superbowl really great owls). trained, studied sacrificed, people need me. wish could change administrative political decisions made work within constraints reality reality people dying - viruses care social constructs.

Thanks sharing! Hicks gonna hick mRNA degrades quickly -70C. I'm talking like less hour. Hey, spent thousands buying wife PPE, hundreds getting high quality mask materials community, dozens hours advocacy, I’m taking care kids wife spends 80 hour weeks keeping CoVID19 patients alive hospital, distant nearly eight months now.

I go store alone, hours every week, curbside pick ups opposite weeks, I’m 20 minutes. 

And I’m often one mask whole time.

I’m issue here.

I’d love wear surgical mask, could everyone masked up, would put place one else bothered wear mask.

You know get taunted wearing mask, double go military grocery store get fogged glasses, I’m restricted vision town people seem itching fight. didn’t want go there. vaccine MSM blasting fake Trump propaganda spreading fear taking it........ literally antivax created Trump presidency. That's 1 vaccine, Moderna J&amp;J Oxford coming soon Pfizer does. need build multiple manufacturing facilities instead one big one. Would make transport easier Yes, means everyone takes vaccine people still get COVID fizzle much quicker highly immune population stopping spread further.  Keep mind next time want rip “Big Pharma.” It’s looking like “Big Pharma” going bail us this. didn’t read article!!! Weird. Worked me... strange. Oh that's great. read headline, assumed still animal trials. promising 90% human trials! Thank part testing see problems electoral college. 2.6 million didn’t v0t3 45 yet motherfucker decided lump us together. Actually, parts Europe anti vaxx, even US.

France, Switzerland, Montenegro trust value vaccines 20% less US. Dumb question still pretty much agreed upon you’ve recovered can’t get spread people? One best friends (asymptomatic) I’m wondering recovers we’ll ok hang inside/masks off/etc bc won’t able get give God damn it, got Yep. Thanks people pfizer biontech gotten much sleep year.   ABC News talked possible vaccine. Best case scenario around 850 million people inoculated end 2021. 

Earth population? 7.6 billion people. 

That means would take 8.94 years inoculate world 2020 population levels. ""we"" is, maybe... world whole, places like US really things anywhere close control... unless mean Spring 2022 (or later), masks distancing considered ""normal"" spring.

Yep. one ugly thing us actually lot fear damned plague. Hell, hurt foot night started take seriously, mid March like others, dancing joy knew I'd one first let jail. 

I expect national response incompetent. I'd never wish fellow Americans, I'm disgusted devastated them. 

I would also jail everyone acting well been. actually stratified risk reasonable way.

Go lay pavement, fats oils body become hot enough make kind fried mac vaccine cheese stick. Garnish freshly cracked black pepper. anyone evidence presented showing type results far....or pharma saying cure? get vaccine done well. 43.5K seems pretty small set me. someone explain typical vaccine trials undertaken sorts numbers? familiar process. behind paywall folks probably open incognito tab want say long term effects covid people say ""young healthy"" still try avoid covid wearing masks public.

People think say young healthy even get wont die get it. might die might get long time. bad enough *might* dead could handle? That's victory?? seems like failure response me. Every country world get shit together better US. Wait what? Ohio? Got link? Refrigerators work dumping heat outside... Simple get test. Iowa open slots testing. county 27. 4% 14-day positivity rate. stay away Midwest. going worse NYC. Ok article showed everywhere last week. discovered since then, what’s discussed one. That's ... That's literally second wave Spanish Flu started.

Please that. uneducated guess would probably base personal risk factor, risk factor due job, well efficacy rate. Sorry say bear ill towards asshats.  work air cargo prepared move vaccines. transported cargo passenger planes. Lots passenger planes still service (this number decreasing). 

But shit going strap seats passenger airliners transport them. (as far I've told) cold storage units setups everything air cargo time unload closely monitored.

Also, UPS currently building freezer farms Louisville home worldport main hub NA. I'd provide link homework UPS freezer farm get going! know two people diagnosed decided travel. One went wilderness diagnosed felt sick. go hospital middle feel like 10 large number mobile morgues have.  Yeah. Grocery, warehouse, food manufacturing workers getting infected keeping country rolling getting pats back basically hazard pay. healthcare workers least decently compensated. others dying sake capitalism. People need stand them, won’t, low prices depend low wage workers, ultimately don’t care die COVID.

Okay. Rant now. GOP defunds closes hospitals.  shouldn’t pretend empathetic use word, mean that’s awful word.

Valved mask worn someone takes efforts protect far superior mask, that’s simple understand.

Yeah, saying fuck anyone can’t bothered wear good mask. area distancing, using masks, owe idiots nothing.

I see dodged last question there. completely ignorant real healthcare PPE shortages, murdering grandmas?  Considering overwhelming majority people get perfectly fine, could potentially conclude bag gummy bears also super effective eaten shortly initial infection. Years long back Oh God vaccine makes people functionally illiterate  Wow really? Extraordinary? Well clears things up. Reporters actually get paid writing shit like this? Texas here. work crisis situations doc died gets COVID. called afternoon. see work 350 miles away morning, medical director hospital it. couldn’t tomorrow I’ve got break Wednesday. I’ll working 24 hour shift Friday Saturday morning get drive 4 hours next location, start 6pm. pull 38 hour shift Monday 8, drive back first hospital start there. I’ve asked eat way, way won’t need lunch. 

I idea I’m getting hospitals. don’t know morale staff, whether using FEMA Nurses, many died sick. don’t know EMR, PPE situation bathrooms are. don’t know I’m sleeping tomorrow. Whether get call room sleep unused patients bed. I’ve got TIDE pods use bathroom sink wash scrubs In. 

This life COVID beat. Kinda bummed subcutaneous application - many monoclonal antibody treatments work great mechanisms. weather nice enough go park somewhere else outdoors? long qualified. Two words: dry ice

Extremly cheap cold enough. deserve money, slimy biotech investors trying profit stuff. thing worried guillain Barre syndrome, shows within weeks months. need wait two years. Em morale! sometimes recognized valuable Member society bring joy salary. keep mindset, life getting better, darkness? Serious question. see darkness hopelessness. sad freaking time. regular physical touch. live alone. quarantine due working hospital. Masks, social distancing, negative news 24/7. Death dying. People suffering ways virus. can't take anymore. fold That's job US FDA, EU FDA, etc. can't verify anything.

But Russian vaccine target US EU population, likely distributed Russia, former USSR countries, maybe middle East Asian countries. China bots incoming!!! highest paying jobs medical field Masks new normal permanently. teachers need know fry? Merkel listening scientists done months ago? Thank you! lot coworkers say it’s right wear mask, even going far say you’re scared virus stay home. Nobody given compelling argument rebuttal scared virus, also can’t afford miss roughly year work, I’m work dependent coworkers come sick. think clinical term type people ""donorcycles."" 

They good work making sure organ donors list fast turnaround. 2020 logic

Do find funny even remotely enjoyable? COVID ban it! fun allowed! Could've Mandated masks prevent this, no. pfizer vaccine. BioNTech vaccine. sounds like logistics costs would whole lot higher kinds vaccines. articles *specifically* whole logistics costs distributing Pfizer vaccine? Asking can't seem find any.  UK even Europe second wave hit, first deaths really increasing thought okay. reality new cases die right away, takes time death statistics reflect rise cases. 2 months daily deaths increased 35-fold (from 10 350), without hospitals exceeding capacity Dr. Li died covid. thought pattern got us current situation. know there. seem stable.  Diwali season people need shop, etc. Crossing fingers method area segregation function continue control situation. 10k Romania would like India 700,000 cases. Wtf, nurses families? “Sorry got covid stay work, hope don’t die it, u go home give family u see them!”

And lot insist paying health, WOW! guess without knowing anything stopped reporting. lucky enough everything came halt back March. Koh Lanta great place weather pandemic. Wear mask, listen science, don’t agree evolution know germs cause sickness. Irresponsibility, lies total lack accountability/leadership, welcome America. mean working assumptions/news stories based european countries, guess I'd think nurses positive covid test used treating people serious covid infections, no?

So ""daily business"" probably still carried staff negative/healthy. I’m nurse, new hospital policy wear N95 mask 5 shifts...uh, thanks. co-workers purchased 3M respirators Amazon use that’s gross. mask ~$20-25 cartridges ~$20-22. Gotta protect yourself, one else will. Thank noticing. forget able see family time..... sweet, sweet extra hazard pay extra $0.00 dollars per hour. Thank helping us understand process behind subtitling. work much appreciated :) uncivil? Okay No, we’re not. extremely interesting time fairly new nurse working Covid since beginning. assure you, walking around hospital hazmat gear. don’t understand point Red blood enemies. year can't help associate Republicans way. didn’t say wasn’t... I'm OP's partner subtitled it, instances I've used shortened translation fit frame better whenever speaker bit overly verbose, unified COVID-19 names, call ""Statens Serum Institut"" denmark's/our/state epidemiologists, call euthanize extermination (euthanize coming mind day).

I've also edited many ehms, stutters various excessive pauses PM who. likes. to. punctuate.

And include statements minister occupation financial support farmers, statements chief police practicalities extermination, questions segment press.

The hour long presser cut parts relevant global health, subtitled sometimes reduced verbosity.

I'm born raised north east central jutland (Aarhus Aalborg), så som udgangspunkt fejler mit Dansk intet, med undtagelse af lidt jysk dialekt, naturally awarding ""good subtitles"" award independent verification. also including positive test results people tested positive finishing quarantine? Maybe that's boosting numbers? Someone needs remind virus Trump lost election. Well, assume nurses positive covid test used treat people covid.

So noone treating (unless tested positive covid &amp; need e.g. respirator &amp; medical care) probably infected. fur real fur cheaper.

And also hell lot nicer! Fake fur leather crap, would always get real stuff. guess offer hope early tell. scares rushed make early claims. choose wait see. Likewise. Doubly healthcare worker. want this. dumber us apathetic, us brainstem either livid detached accept dystopian hellscape work. next year it’s 18,000% capacity. It’s called exponential growth. health system (doctors, nurses etc) fucked years even centuries everything said done.. Dead doctors nurses come back... become biggest problem vaccination.And vaccine makers certainly try avoid vaccinating people already strong immunity.

Apart waste resources (which probably less waste testing everyone find immune vaccinating half regardless), problem vaccination? like extra special double detention virus get military Yes matter context. I’d like much information possible seemingly healthy kid died, actually big pre existing condition. question random mutation actually gave kids worse outlook prepared. Yet Murican's calling Pfizer's vaccine even Trump's vaccine. Okay, first all, AOC nothing Biden Trump. one reps NYC, presidential candidate, regular Bronx bartender got involved politics, touch wealthy white liberal elite. Second, take credit vaccine, granting credit it. obviously terrible idea.

Sick nurses treat covid patients better treatment.

It terrible nurses get even exposure, stress sick etc... That's get even horrors stories young nurses dying covid/stress...

I feel bad everyone working medical field US right now, though germany also spiraling downhill, worry us aswell... Especially sister nurse, too. Imagine cancer patient #Iowain2weeks Parts Australia recent election too. region still counting votes, around 100 votes difference two candidates. area 12 covid cases entire pandemic.  India 30-40k cases- Covid scam. expect, enforce it. infrastructure built. excuses company-paid short vacations, late-night airport trips me. certainly proud getting kindergarten-style mile king badges airlines, use many free iPads. heavy metals vaccines acted magnet attracted bus ran patient over. someone used go /r/watchpeopledie recalibrate perspective life, I'm surprised. supposed feel sorry people refused wear masks recent Sturgis bike festival?

They made bed, let lie it. virus complete cell plasma metabolism like bacteria types viruses survive sea water without issue. Let's let scientists figure instead going really long limb here. Sweden's cumulative pop-adjusted excess deaths/M 50. That's me. Thanks. ties government? connection saw mentioned, company PM Trnava.

There candidates buy test from, selling test manufacturer, Slovak one cheapest. yeah let’s let covid positive nurses work instead trying slow spread .

It's desparation. shit happened italy Covid real bad first half year. 

You need personel treat people. people already covid, matter person covid treats you.

Yeah, sick people forced work, stay home, whole system collapse even would die... Alright statistics might wrong, tell real statistics. hope still using ventilators. They've found cause lung damage covid patients Honestly I'm expecting certain percentage population go beyond live little harder months often can’t get people supposed get there? Ambulances aren’t going states, can’t barely they’ve got. Plus, can’t take ambulance service 10 hours drive someone another state leave swath jurisdiction without ambulance. ""But 1% . Goodbye uncle Tom Billy HighSchool!""

HARD /S. Maybe test severe cases?

Here Spain example, brother infected live together symptoms work home, get tested unless symptoms. hospital us also still surgeries patients pre-op post operative care. Trying feed everyone spread hospital getting insane. ( work traypasser nutrition). far still rehab floor backup used yet. close capacity quite horrific (am Idaho). please stop calling ""Pfizer vaccine"". Pfizer develop it, partnered BioNTech help run trials scale. 

It's ""BioNTech vaccine"".  Finland started building new rooms/wings/units hospitals last march ready patients well even needed them. problem I'll go tomorrow. stop asshole? I'm voted but, vote basically count many conservatives :( I'll need thots prayers That’s awful. I’ve seen clean rooms...they disinfect everything. empty trash, change linens, wipe toilet, wipe dry erase board, mop. Get rid ridiculous 2nd amendment start clearing country guns perhaps continue make fun ""tasteless"" manner. [Motorcyclist killed anti-helmet wonder California send nurses North Dakota help. I'm sure every state leary that, case there's surge home state, sounds like ND desperate.

But yeah snarky ones we've make snippy joke really tasteful Look Argentina doing! week ago, 75% capacity statement state decide need beds. Basically... go hospital. fine. need go hospital. worked sooo well.. Might US politics always Right little less Right. Liberals Left spectrum possibilities. living not-at-risk, (90%) life continuing normal would good. Sadly, know people they're respirator. Don’t dentists wear N95s? population 60 million.

Also, 1% officially reported.

Think US like 50 little countries little rules ability restrict movement other. one state everything right next state not. thankful area facility work in. think case pretty much state besides maybe NY north near there. I’m Texas it’s really bad right now. extremely rural help things. I’m sure people actually actively trying protect others helpful well. Unlike people still deny it’s real disease, literally beds left, even non-covid related pts now. Count blessings. Surely stuff (vaccine availability, restrictions, etc.) done state-level anyway governors? Missouri hosed well. Rural areas max capacity since August. St. Louis mask mandates unlike rest state, nearing capacity well. county executive doctor though understands implications, alone much. Stores stopped enforcing masks mandates employees getting threatened mandate teeth. People catch matter what, forget. Meanwhile losing jobs go hungry across world. See family crazy work hotel go tons gloves daily ThAnK HeAlThCaRe HeRoS AnGeLs coddle one man's ego  ""Pro-Life"" lovers America.  Literally first time life I've felt gratitude disdain US pharmaceutical corp. Posts like keep sane. wish could go bar club. I’m sitting losing hair feel like world ending daily bc social interaction going 9 months. running covid tests without mask didn’t any. back May. Watch deaths skyrocket. That’s happened Wuhan, Italy, NY, Detroit. wasn’t number cases, per se, fact hospitals maxed capacity. soon full, mortality jumped dramatically. 
 
Hopefully EUA monoclonal antibodies save lives, it’s ti tough couple weeks Dakota territory. live similar situation. I’ve come realize idea changing within hopeless. option leave somewhere that’ll make happier hope people remain figure one day. I've linked actual academic paper (The Lancet) quote academic paper.

You're literally reporting something *The Lancet*. reading article hope encourages healthcare workers unionize. hospitals ally, they’re ones asked nurses allowed work testing positive covid-19. whole “we don’t allow unionization would limit help you” BULL. 

Fuck administration asked allow this. see there. Ugh, see Ricketts said today/yesterday? Biden asked order mask mandate ""if really president elect. would still say no."" something effect. jackass. forget fact NYC burying many unclaimed virus victims hard time keeping mass graves? *What U.S. did, meanwhile, commit buying hundreds millions vaccines advance ensure Americans were* [*among *in line clinches emergency-use authorization approval FDA. Trump administration agreed July pay almost $2 billion 100 million doses, option acquire many 500 million more, clearance comes.*

*As part agreement, U.S. gets decide gets vaccine first, work company logistical gets vaccine first political $ motivated... we're still first wave

It's basically third peak continuous shitstorm. It’s risk demand. demand extremely high places like North Dakota one wants live there. Eventually gets point hospitals offer astronomical pay bring people (like $5400 per week mentioned earlier) Can't reminded enough fake statistic? shared

I think word missing American English dictionary. Yeah, media outlets choice sell fear anger, they're buying up. really works, deal known quantities. Maybe -24 lasts months, maybe days..no one knows sure something want taking punt on. can't imagine nurse respond Covid deniers bedridden hospital still refuse acknowledge ""flu"". Great hear. earn medical degree? clearly well informed Democrats blame this. much this. weird people reacting different form governance people may choose prefer themselves. Belgium moment.
Medical staff working covid, pressure fking high, doubts killed one came seek help... like half year prepare... I'm currently quarantine coworker went Halloween party caught 'rona. We've masked distanced working home much possible, can't get zero contact. I'm isolated home 2 weeks decided wanted hang friends.  Like want freaking hang friends?

We need solid mandate COMPLETE nationwide shutdown EVERYTHING grocery delivery 4 weeks. really commend government, even federal (I’m Melbournian). solutions may perfect, didn’t fuck around argue it, implemented payments short time! 

JobKeeper absolute godsend business work for. shut 8 weeks. able continue pay everyone $750 week (pre tax) ensured everyone able get ready return side. 

We back work 6 weeks still receiving reduced version scheme subsidise wages recover. also received payroll tax relief. 

While payments less peoples wages, ways people able make last rent relief mortgage freezes six months needed it. 

Today Victorian government also announced kindergarten free next year. (Saving $2000 per child) 

I feel like say seems I’m bragging. don’t mean to, feel lucky. 

My heart breaks see rest world going right now. know goverments are....especially American goverment  opportunity young people state like SD KS MS? 
 

Well Kansas Cerner Garmin...but Cerner laid bunch developers outsourced India. Aus (my state, Victoria) used complete solution. involves long lockdowns financial support, mask mandates, curfew. painful zero cases now. freedom relief felt indescribable.

It's almost if, drunk ""personal freedom"" mythology, cooperate rational basis, gain actual freedom.

Amazing! ever care affects personally. lack empathy defining characteristic conservatives. America, what’s deal? That's good, campus since start pandemic. I'm glad hear they're taking seriously quote article linked earlier. misleading. Think said psychiatric disorder past year caught COVID much risk additional (or new) psychiatric symptoms. Reporting violating title rule (plus link goes pdf). They're republicans they'll pull bootstraps etc etc article anything talks this? Would like read bit share around too. Years targeted propaganda designed make fear Look, Rona looked election saw mandate. North Dakota voted coronavirus coronavirus obliged them. would rude kill many North Dakotans possible.

Anyone says otherwise dirty communist. North South Dakota’s worse managed states. Loved blown away bad is. injected muscle veins. Jeez, that's bit much erectile dysfunction ""Infected nurses work.""

Bruh.... *Or keep spare mask situations.* sort makes sense since 65% state's population voted guy brushes great numbers. Except mutates could catch risk dying changes. never worth rolling dice never stop rolling vaccine out. France freak reach 60% capacity... I'm sorry live governed way. Ughh things continue spiraling control might end seeing service called UberMorgue least government protecting Taliban, surely that's bigger risk disease that's taken half family. I’ll believe see it.  Yes... also bodes ill effectiveness vaccinations. Reinfectious becoming common multiple observed Netherlands, generally 6 months later initial covid infection....

This could mean covid vaccinations could effective roughly 6 months... obviously good, *ready deploy* \- i.e., possibility deployment could weak link chain point, vaccine *will* ready then.

The aim ensure get situation vaccines dressed nowhere go - say definitely begin vaccinating date. Yeah I’ve looking salaries emergency medicine (my speciality interest), rural areas pay $100-150k urban areas demand high relative supply. tempting say least Never mind people suffering diseases much greater risk hospitals full. get marching orders Foxnews.  *The kind theater where, random scene, actors go public start garroting audience.* co-worker actually 3 times.

Common sense? “It’ll go away Nov 3rd Biden elected.” - Right prior Election Day Yes. Yes. someone ND, fuck ND shit COVID response. fuck everyone enables spread gives shits it.  Unite Dakotas  Ok thought utah bad least we're bad son paramedic picks ""I wear helmet seatbelt"" people massive head injuries highways. also become human projectile wearing seatbelt injure others. can't say agree logic it. tyranny

One popular conspiracy theorist used word 20 years anything agree with. word lost meaning. based LA + USC means full capacity could mean 24 hour wait get seen ER. term know it, coined LA County General one busiest ER's U.S. birthplace modern emergency medicine. documentary called Code Black fascinating look emergency medicine. dont know yet. Tests far show people vaccine much less likely tested positive covid. means less definitely likely get sick clear vaccine stopped virus entirely (so non transmissable) stopped making people ill (still allowing asymptomatic transmission). almost certainly reduce transmission well illness early say much true, think hospital admin taking pay cuts? Nah uh clearly it’s people actually saving patients (doctors, nurses, techs, etc.) need pay cut, can’t poor executives lose giant bonuses [Artist installs 200,000 white flags Washington representing Covid-19 deaths  That’s absolutely retarded counterpoint. many people known it? agree mitigate spreading important never fucking asshole tried go work sick leave house sick always wore mask. I've entire life. Ok, word would use hypocrisy? Perhaps it’s “endorsement” instead? 

If it’s hypocrisy assume people advocating outdoor celebrations large gatherings acceptable. certainly hope single one accused people trying get life sort 7 degrees murder. trolling. believe happened, ludicrously naive think morally bankrupt pharmaceutical company That's tangentially related comment best Hmmm.

We're getting lot mixed messages super-spreader events even people outdoors wearing masks social distancing. Lol.

No. numbers aren’t there. Oh yeah! There’s too. Thank you, friend. :) Well it’s going take north year get enough vaccine made, meanwhile highest levels CoVID19 hospitalizations, hit fastest time new million cases.

Things much accelerating vaccine isn’t going reverse anytime soon. read seems like could thing.

A real working new tech vacinne Covid going HUGE cientific breakthrough...

I'm starting optimistic next years actually going good years... Sounds like stop grandstanding friends person anymore feel strongly this. don’t tell everyone can’t wait tell “friend” fuck off. trying trick you, genuinely concerned. ;( think people refuse too, myriad reasons...smdh Completely agree, teachers high list! Maybe right medical staff.

Also, love username, receiving TV guide under? lot measures relaxed Australia get firm handle control. long term effects virus know already mean lot careful flu recommended always mask sanitiser utilised places effective social distancing possible public transport busy centres able socialise without many issues, long hygiene strongly considered. 

On bright side see measures use control spread covid also effect illnesses including cold flu well bacterial illnesses well bad news. adjustment people nothing adaptable. 

I think better us look forward rather lament past mean gives human body ace2? hopefully people helped bring opioid epidemic truthful. fauci calling bullshit, hopefully good go, drug company talking ass.  help greatly 25M doses produced short term, may even used pre approval (as emergency use). next 600M doses out, enough doses make true dent world’s population late 2021. That’s logistics really needed that’s us might get chance receive it. Hopefully least one two vaccines arrive meantime too. 

This still long way people. Anyone mind set vaccinated first half next year probably want adjust expectations grow extremely frustrated spring. 36 min late??? read article!?!  Really wonder truely 90% pumping make gasoline remains One really tell trolls way begin posts. KNOW winter tough vaccine available everyone tomorrow, people gathering indoors Holidays, Biden occupying White House next months. ruin day mentioning this.

He's incorporated number people advisory board, that's means he's going listen he's going automatically follow everyone say times. Stay safe there! Looks like storm cut close. What's special mRNA?  idea think reason taxi drivers can't legally refuse take place (morocco)

its public service obligation take want go, otherwise taxis would pick chose end high concentration high turnover areas leaves places serviced. quick calculation vaccine distribution process could affected age.

It's exactly shocking information virus affects older people younger people. break deaths age group.

What think lot people appreciate small target gives us compared incredibly large amount potential harm reduction. Let's start group highest absolute value deaths- 65 74- count upward. We're talking people 65 up.

That group represents 171,814 recorded 217,348 deaths: **79.05%**. age group also 54,058,236 people United States- well, assuming discounted tally dying- population 328,239,523: **16.47%**. quick dirty version vaccinating around 16% population would prevent around 79% deaths. That's pretty good deal.

I know who's gonna distributing vaccines- might come states federal government, might start given Trump continue distributed Biden- say think massive focus needs given elderly, health care workers course, CDC already advised. people pre existing conditions, I'm going little concerned see young people getting vaccine every elderly American wants gotten it. might little sadistic, see numbers game first. Making someone 65 immune is, quick dirty calculation, almost *five times likely* prevent death immunizing someone 65. That's huge deal.

Again, I'm blowing anyone's mind I'm sure well qualified experts making decisions already considered kind outlook. guess point two fold: great idea immunize elderly early possible, one upset comes young people getting vaccine time elderly. exactly, placebo group compare exactly, placebo group compare Wisconsin coughed Illinois soup apart study feel well. currently feeling pain different parts stomach severe back pain. barely walk bend over. called hospital let know symptoms didn’t seem interested. treat like suspicious vaccine.  agreeing on? like dude make ur mind

Im making zero that's got rid millions minks also refused acknowledge

Its widely reported one reasons done potential impact vaccines. reporting wrong would interested knowing why. reaponded rambling tweet contracted claims.

Your argument consistently contradicts itself. believe one scientist twitter felt could impact vaccines? guy scientist valid opinion? Youre making seemed frustrated earlier win lot arguments

What argument? thing statement made sceptical certain are.

What think believe regarding danger coronavirus mutating moves human mink human? insight Lets assume 1000 people vaccinated 1000 placebo group. time later check persons: e.g. might 100 infected people within placebo group 10 infected people vaccine group: i.e. statistical conclusion around 90 infections 100 possible prevented, 90% effective can’t. probably involve appointments vaccination massive first come, first serve lines... Well, safety data people didn’t get sick got vaccine. haven’t actually combed data myself, imagine elderly would less response vaccine. unlikely thing going get sick. 

It one great experiments medical history. Haha 👌 4% herd immunity LOOOONG way off.  Years ,  possible all. Read article, vast majority exhaled droplets captured mask, much total escaped droplets par KN95 surgical masks well beyond Etsy masks.

Again, mask mandate, area weren’t pretending like nothing wrong I’d cover exhaust port, it’s Wild West I’m going bother.

If police enforce trespassing people won’t mask go grocery stores, state/county/city puts place mask ordinance I’ll 100% board looks, it’s me. Summer '21 gonna lit

Sure hope right. still see challenge vaccinate hundreds millions billions people. Also Pfizer’s vaccine needs boost shot 28 days complicates even more. Easy say need hospital bed ventilator. 

Both sides held accountable. open criticism. 

I’m marching rights, incredibly shortsighted. vaccines people contribute society then. Unlike you. imagine get virus. says 90% effective mean 90% safe (surely way higher % safe...)  What's number lightly symptomatic? mask usage may inoculated lots people getting exposed light viral loads.  never get good data distribution Covid various viral loads ages. Yup,it's doubling 40 80 province 8 million people insight  Turns vaccine bleach. Trump right along. Trump even saying debates vaccine would ready couple weeks lmao conspiracy There’s way anyone could known anything sure trial unblinded. worlds canned meat comes like 3 giant warehouses go buy spam. ship hormel let distribute Tampa confirming that’s true. Nearly signs gone; little floor stickers placed 6ft apart gone; masks gone...

My Grandmama’s home finally opened visitors 7+ months. careful diligent... screening everyone... limiting visiting hours number people... even mandatory class every prospective visitor required take. waiting list long able finally register Saturday morning 9am. 

Someone brought Covid week they’ve shut indefinitely. 

This big complaint - it’s important me, know I’m one truly lucky ones.

This never end long people continue careless. Guys, please! Come on!! Yeah isn’t uncommon pharmaceutical industry. Plenty companies outsource production distribution drugs discover develop processes time. even appropriate situation need mass produce distribute many doses possible around world.

Also, BioNtech Pfizer done business past (or might still partnership I’m sure), already relationship. It’s like Pfizer stealing vaccine means. anyone wondering, article mainly talks cryologistical challenges -70 celsius storage requirement. New Year’s Eve. New Year’s Day. Yoo whoever player plague.inc atm killin’ it. Though it’s obvious they’re playing easy mode. That’s obviously false. Lots time hands harass people every sub 90 Day Fiancé Coronavirus. Sheesh. ""No brunch! sportsball! want kill Aunt Martha?"" There's 350 million Americans alone. logistics mass immunize people tremendous. need vaccine, storage, transport, sharps, gloves, disposal. 6 months would incredibly fast. ceremony outdoors (we’re south cold weather isn’t normally issue Feb), reception venue people outdoors want also. venue hold 3x number guests have, room spacing tables dinner. We’re seating chart, people sit people feel comfortable sitting with, whether that’s family know careful people already hang often anyway. staff masked, guests wear masks want to. someone doesn’t feel comfortable coming, we’re making clear that’s fine, don’t want anyone feel guilted coming they’re concerned virus.

Obviously it’s still risk ideal world could postpone, since restrictions state, parents tens thousands dollars so, don’t want make call them.  Group spent 50 years incentivizing generation brain drain Group B. Group B's smartest people develop world-saving vaccine using resources Group A, talking group deserves might give impression lane. part problem... gonna say - dry ice cheap effective 2 week hard shut would help country tremendously.

Yes, would get everybody listen? People would rioting streets.

That might good idea theory, probably practice. I'm Daytona. know lots places still require sign ask masks, seems like majority area wear it. BTW they've already found method plan using allows transport vaccines 10 days acceptable temperature exactly would vaccine cause side effects 20 years line? It’s system within weeks get it. biggest risk time get it. They've already found method plan using allows transport vaccines 10 days acceptable temperature fucking make it, moves needs moved. Eradication won’t happen. interesting question much help get partial immunity next 6-18 months vaccine (that reached majority). example, much 30% immunity reproduction rate? It’s reduction R 30% likely more. 

The optimistic scenario level immunity allows slightly looser restrictions keeping R 1, area naive population would e.g R=1.4 exponential growth. 

It would kind herd immunity (it’s immunity drove R 1) 30% immunity true herd immunity normal sense it’s working *together with* distancing mitigations. Take away mitigations R 1. talking WSB today trying decide freezer associated industries throw money at. Hardly hospital, let alone small surgery pharmacy got freezer capable reaching temperatures -70 degrees Celsius. indeed challenging logistically I’m afraid see screwups along way.

Nobody outside clinical trials vaccinated people seem happy already herd immunity.   Summer '21 gonna lit Mrs Harris going let Americans take wait inauguration? I'm questioning it, also live florida almost never see anyone without mask. Signs still everywhere. 

I think really depends part florida in. Side effect completely shit state leadership. ""Only 3,924 cases"" good number. still way high. fact dropping means lots states far worse Florida better. Hardly anyone know paying attention Covid stuff anymore. 
This state frustrating. Bruh sub man y'all support figures authority scientists support views

And unless Trump able meddle comes warp speed HQ (I hope think can) I'll take word Funny released ''results'' one week elections! personally don’t think it’s possible reduce number infections schools remain open. proper lockdown 2-3 weeks would probably work better less harmful bunch half-assed lockdowns row. Stonks! know fact infuriated people normality spring/summer likely  Agreed. can't focus preventing drug deaths giving direct aid addicts either. instead prevent *spread* drugs going cartels dealers. That's real way deal drug issues! trying market Florida Holiday Travel season. Come one come all..... even give free gift take home.

I know like four people traveling state Dec. holidays."
