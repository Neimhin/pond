0,2020-12-01," think SARS virus got started one wet markets would use sign close good. no. get Covid-19 one well.  Third time's charm? diabetic double amputee Money abundance test subjects can't buy long term results. Yes, right trials yielded quicker typical results efficacy immediate adverse effects valid statistically appropriate. processes can't parallelized - strange fluke biology new vaccine effects 10 years in, there's 100% incidence Big Toe Cancer, know least 2030 regardless many people trials.

From public health perspective no-brainer push people accept miniscule risk known immediate danger. selfish ""rational actor"" individual perspective sort understand people might want line get jabbed, instead let others bear burden inoculation. Ya grandparents might see Facebook [slide literally says ""NOT DISTRIBUTION // OFFICIAL USE PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY"".

Sure, ""TOP SECRET"" similar realm ""not supposed publicly shared"". someone really think ""AOCC"" best acronym? feel like whoever made trolling Trump leading mind AOC. Wisconsin guy...all say is, ""Jesus balls."" Sounds like sand vagina. like President paying $750 taxes 😂 horrible leadership would reframe *the pandemic whole* worsening burnout. lets get control lockdown first place fault they’re tasty! :( people south light area is? duh! mean, still winning much! Gah! I’m scared there's muppet wearing mask, surgical cloth mask much prevent getting indoors. They're really effective everyone wearing masks or... wearing high grade respirator mask like N/P/R 95 better. ""Party plague"" cases would reasonable say ""someone tested positive, contact advise get tested."" article:

The proposal would include another direct payment Americans. also would offer temporary federal protection coronavirus-related lawsuits.

I think major issue proposed bill. I’d rather wait another 10 days pass better version waste opportunity bad bill.  Also state tough restrictions. Florida literally fully open restrictions. Seems florida said fuck shows really matter. might see people actually something it... kind like there's money going cure male pattern balding fight malaria. I'm pretty sure welded shut doors building one entrance. Made easier screen people coming out. ever get tired copy paste reactionary waiting get opinion Tucker Carlson? Australia went suppression worked well us. flare ups, jump fast hard. worked part, though we're woods yet.

Fact economic damage done USA immeasurable, that's even factoring terrible human cost. really looking like America turning failed state. Great point and... know people see long view even try deny short view. believe choose simply much. midst pandemic, short resources end sight thanks variety bullshit honestly, also long term repercussions people's health directly impact health care system economy. cracked glass opacities lungs? Yeah absolutely deadly person catches flu future, COVID 19 gone. Blood clots? Also deadly, along mini strokes long hauler symptoms. human mortality rate awful, factor strain system, loss productivity, loss income name things, future looking pretty fucking rough while. 

Please, wear mask. buy acid tablets?  Thank information, comment ignorant accusing being.

First off, incorrect say ""unless obese diabetes/etc, literally nothing worry about"". number otherwise healthy individuals adversely affected - severe ways. Although unlikely, mean concerned.

Secondly, ignorant this, almost year now. came comment looking information may know, hopefully people educated subject (and educated apparently). must niii-iiice... US one lowest rates physicians per capita industrialized world.

In part, due AMA lobbying limit number residencies relative scarcity providers support highest medical costs world.

Now get see really looks like. think death piling top crisis, though? many hundreds thousands dead? many loved ones sleeping empty beds? every person dies, likely two suffer. entire healthcare apparatus also sustaining long term mental health issues.

Then there's cancer patients, need life-saving easing surgery also die pass away.

Yes, hardest, trying time I've ever lived through. I'm good place mentally, myself.

Knowing could unknowingly cause literal death keeps saying fuck pretending everything fine.

Might well try save lives, try save others suffering. Care share degrees scientific field us published Natty light stained studies? doesn't. Johns Hopkins, NY Times, many sources publishing public free dashboards maps daily.

And pretty much called ""fake news"" accused making shit make situation look worse is.

In context, leak *official* US government data shut least people, probably still gonna move goalpost ""That's fake!"" ""That's (((deep state))) propaganda!"". Put mask put glasses on, bottom part frames top part mask beneath them, like [this decent countries one could emigrate require sort trade skill? could food server, tech support customer service.. works phone/device repair. hope us, would need get degrees? blame poor messaging. made clear vaccine approved that's step 1. seem take months vaccinate enough population make difference. need small miracle terms production, storage, shipping. Also Swedish people actually listening science government advised people social distance, wear masks, stay home.  2018 wealthy county state capacity turning away folks helps better realize much worse likely poorer counties. Exactly this.

The virus real. Absolutely. take precautions get frustrated people work wear mask nose. 

But something weird. We're going allow Christmas parties here. Two parties within four days, 10 people max 3 households. hell would allow this? got second shot two months ago. idea got vaccine placebo felt zero side effects. Don’t forget least week ‘democratic hoax’ according baby chief. feel like people forget part. Dentist *office* workers may wait. Dentists, hygienists, x-ray techs whoever else actually works hands-on patients likely higher priority receptionists book-keepers (though dental receptionists book-keepers likely get preference general public).

There's going hard-and-fast rule. state going work explicit priority lists. They're going take number vaccines they'll get week, urban/rural divides, logisticsl challenges, percentage group want vaccinate time (the vaccines (particularly second shot) make people feel sick, probably want give entire staff day), etc. lot considerations.

All said, fully expect dental workers moderately high priority many states. Many people put appointments, non-trivial number health issues result, dental offices lower PPE priority hospitals EMS, patients can't masked they're worked on, water-picks drills cause high degree aerosolization. Dental eorkers absolutely high-risk essential service likely *some* priority lists states make up. week second dose ... 3 weeks first dose

Wait, thought 4 weeks two doses, 5 weeks? Education second best Yeeeesssssss! I’ve never felt less motivated done little warrant it. use zoom. perspective, 36,000 traffic fatalities 2018 US. 40,000 COVID deaths November US. Interesting source says wrong, hospitalizations per million people week last week South Dakota, 2x US  Well 15,000 half placebo get point. Yup, except big empty spots Gaslight. Obstruct. Project. Exactly this. restrictions taking could save pain later instead seems like many places waiting things really fall cliff restrictions. many people still visiting family holidays. gonna real sad start year people loved ones start dying. Yes. Yes would. they'd probably bite zombie show me. above: Cause pandemic. Bail billion dollar companies small businesses go under. 

Imagine kind pandemic response team could place agile response. Imagine Americans weren’t dumb led compassionate person said wear mask. seem rather uptight. usually updates around 11PM me. It’s 271K right surprisingly wide range opinions fail use either fact reason share enthusiasm 2 year old covered snot. E# doesn’t exist. mean ? Wow yeah, pretty uniquely ill-equipped job situation. Shitty man. suck great thing say people struggling Dec talk Interesting source says wrong, hospitalizations per million people week last week South Dakota, 2x US work people would hide zombie bite Wait, hotspot? ""I could wear mask, could get upset slightly uncomfortable, ruin economy, put lives risk international pandemic. AIN'T WEARIN' FUCKIN' MASK!"" - many Americans hmmm, CDC,  
0-19, survival rate = 99.997% - .003% chance die 
20-49, survival rate = 99.98% - .02% chance die 
50-69, survival rate = 99.55% - .45% chance die 
Nobody said 69.  
Ya'll FEAR DEATH, wash hands, keep mask on, keep away peeps.  
IF roommate - stay room, that? stop living?  Roommates selfish? yeah, not. 
\~\~\~\~ 
Kinda like China saying December LAST YEAR, (thanks Taiwan exposing info) 
""hmmm, people flu, dying, let's contain 'SARS like flu' KNEW killed people past rest world get sick"".  
\~\~\~\~ 
just kidding, KNOW say that, they?  
Nope, let millions people travel world New Years, Chinese New Years (busiest travel holiday world), allowed release 'deadly'. smh 
\~\~\~\~ 
Suggestion sick, media tell this, ya'll seem truly like believing propaganda. slow panties bunching... REAL, WAY sold die. Since here, go google DAVOS Great Reset TRY might think logically happening.  
TAKE vitamins, Vitamin D, C, Elderberry, Zinc. Get exercise in, eat healthy.  
And God, whomever believe in, families lost lives terrible Covid flu. Maybe use anger 'terrible roommates', China getting away biowarfare upon world = country world + GDP btw. ""that led coronavirus pandemic""

Off cause intentional still continued ignorance nothing virus spreading … Chinas fault Januar! Also reach Europe US, need prepare yet! /s feel bad Americans still trying take seriously. must feel like modern-day Cassandras, trying warn countrymen impending danger getting ignored special...stop narrative 6000 people nursing homes. News flash nursing homes great areas. Even count though let's talk 270,000 people.

This like complaining Enron handling money poorly using executive throwing penny fountain example.

Just stop. would antivaxers prolong it? everyone else gets vaccine ones likely die it. solve problems. SMH partner nurse excited get vaccinated. I'll definitely breathe easier safer. That, letting hundreds thousands people die also causing mental health crisis, so...

There's stopping mental health crisis. Might well save lives. federal leadership effectively resigns, people can't sure listen to. crazy facebook friends may great info, all. research, god damn shit.

This leadership, current POTUS failure every level. Aaahh angry this. Also, agree many people flagrantly breaking rules. Hence skepticism. actually read wrote? said better damn good study, implications huge. every example cited would considered safe (with possible exception dining example surely whatever ""safe"" limits were, based findings. thanks info That's good thing. makes readily available want it.  lot races watched 2 candidates neither constituents best interest. extremely unfortunate. Always been. happens 12 weeks? Please understand country dumb fuck aggregate millions smart, compassionate, high quality Americans trying desperately move country right direction. Listen bubba, crowd sizes limit likelihood one way - is, less people there, less chance ONE it. particular calculation take people account, also sq footage. suspect airflow.

Nursing home residents almost never around single person hours upon hours continuously day. Based calculation, hardly get staff. talking about? Cases surging record-breaking number hospitalizations. sister-in-law nurse approaching capacity, “empty.” think everyone world access news could told Call center chance. group bottom list. should. expect anyone take something serious elected officials don't. Government joke. really think someone already family members currently intubated WOULDN’T taking necessary precautions? person also thinks (in U.S.) use Sweden model do, also disagreeing universal healthcare implemented.

Also throw model ""near universal adoption health officials' recommendations"" presumably person also agree his/her health officials. mean rude asking, theoretical point return?  would say china worst initial response covid couple reasons, originated there, iirc lied fact companies mandate liability telling people they’ve exposed backwards. 

So want economy totally crushed, yet don’t require employers tell employees they’ve got letting spread potentially killing people.

I don’t get it. Canada extending non-essential travel ban along border (cars etc.) country absolutely fine that. 
 
Sorry neighbours, Orange Chief really wanted ""Red Wave"", monkey's paw gave him... dont understand leaked releases love Fox isn’t crazy enough. We’re doomed species. I'd expected 30M doses end March, companies.
This looks like 12M so.  want get cold again. Same. reason tapped yet telling get spring. If....and mean get many people vaccinated time, would unbelievably huge reducing spread! However...it would require monumental effort planners, logistical operations, manufacturers, medical personnel. doubt possible never say never. looking ICU capacity metric total state shutdown. trying avoid rationing care nursing students non icu nurses care icu patients. outcome going drastically different. exact reasoning well. least abjectly unhinged reality together. Thanks, hallucinated digital projection personified self esteem paid 15 bucks bud light hornets game January really cool souvenir cup came in. paid everything hands beer solo cup tells don’t sell 😔  matter though, us crippled still second largest economy world (behind China possibly eu combine europes gdps). Massive unemployment due lockdowns coronavirus, pre covid low. Americas gdp per capita still higher 95% world (including Australia). agree coronavirus mismanaged guy there's need hate America country equivalent one state US many experts vaccines zero questions safety risks. Good folks, make nice easy producers. Wow. Full dead bodies sounds like they're top wife's situation. support making students wear masks. told health officials tell school anyone exposed someone tests positive. trust district transparent though, keep downplaying safety risks clear goal go full remote, matter what. shall see. 1500 died Titanic..

one sailin' every night now. 

&amp;#x200B;

planes. need planes. hope Omg, expect end. Thank Funny thing could using military armed forces help pandemic setting field hospitals commander chief give shit pandemic. plenty nurses medics armed forces could really utilize help current ongoing surges going hospitals. Thats always wear socks sandals. Also look great cargo shorts 😎 Downvote guy right should’ve taken food room everyone ate outside like recommended laws romeo juliet. 

I'm saying denied entirely. I'm saying first doses. 

Okay 9% 1% makes point even clearer. 

Nah don't. Hence people dwis get 3-4 prison usually 11/29. (Hopefully know means).

Keep going making point clear. many people wrongly jail. reason. deserve first/second/third. easiest way make sure prisons safe? Vaccinate employees, deliveries must wear masks, stop visitation safely done. 

Don't give goddamn limited amount vaccines choose sell drugs steal. (Covering bases ya) [According uncertain might around ~80 deaths currently, know better two weeks.

What find worrying hospitalizations ICU still rise, albeit slowly, means increase daily deaths probably go quite - maybe even rest year. pointless 50% Americans (people eat current governments rhetoric) fed steady diet bullshit invalidates effort non-brain dead Americans put in. Please, please see least one ENT chiropractor. ENTs doctors trained handle medical issues. Chiropractors not. got two eyes two ears. grow back. No, told to, greater good. People need learn sometimes go little unpleasantness personally society grow.

Different people need learn sometimes society held back selfish people pleasant things even others suffer. argue line demarcation is, needs really far away ""Always think others yourself."" exemplifies whole political process rigged since democrats republicans hate politicians like this, since democratic incumbent would course win city like Austin. could stop taking offense police word choice much know, keeps people safe? questions like see answered COVID-19 vaccine, let us know comments. We're continually updating story Getting new coach? Harbaugh absolute garbage Ironic government caused take look lifestyle , reflect much get away everything become appreciative able visit couple friends. follow gourd  lmao 23 hours ago commented we’re “almost folks” pissed, dad exposed someone covid Saturday room today out. shown symptoms. I've staying times case caught it. didnt know im freaking sneezed coughed breathing thinking I'm safe room. Grrr Depends big you’re talking hearing experts think virtually back normal March April. 

This winter going *suck* it’s final hump get get lives back. Full of... Exactly this. People social media equating hesitant vaccine anti-vaxxers that's simply true time. POTUS, symptom cause. literally wanna get fucked bar I’m shoved like sardine tin next sweaty girls smell hairspray spent $75 3 drinks take home dude named Kyle I’m drunk maintain standards.

I never thought I’d want back am. want watch Red Wings lose person drunk go gamble win money back.  think logic correct. Assuming vaccine produces needs to, there’s reason assume won’t also make clear virus faster get it. fact every reason believe vaccine make clear faster. See flu vaccine (I know, know isn’t flu, it’s go case).

The vaccines COVID almost certainly don’t produce long term sterilizing immunity reason proved efficacious helped people clear virus fast antibodies actively working bodies fought disease took hold (like short term sterilizing immunity). Yeah hear you. Let's hope last time ever need use it, too. plan continue wearing mask University ends mask mandate. figure point, it'll safe wear one anymore. Yaayy ! [pandemic pigs](/r/Masks4All/comments/juq7w8/dont_be_a_pandemic_pig_wear_your_mask/) ! Thanks this. I’m saving skeptical comment Well there's email leaked said goal herd immunity. Swedes denied looks bad. keeps talking though pretty funny. ""new"" life become new normal, guarantee you, would rather jump bridge life social distancing bullshit life, meet like 2 friends time. Imagine sitting home pandemic mostly functional society around you, understanding people keeping functioning aren’t sitting pajamas  matter you. I'm American. We'd different ideas government supposed work protect citizens. Exactly... It’ll make people want vaccinated told wait. It’s probably accident rollout slow. definitely sounds like well thought tactic would use power. dont think freedom issue, think social media/radio/other platforms uneducated people given voice people worked field years, sometimes decade.

Also looks like country wide lack critical thinking seems fosted - whislt everyone, enough population huge issue. Sign trial got 50/50 chance getting one now. J&amp;J probably still recruiting 2-shot trial, Novavax starting day AstraZeneca might part trial again. thing. Hungary get enough either, then? Great, can't wait sit home another 8 months again. Heres link committee made seriously qualified experts looked deeply. 

The live press cnference heads JCVI made clear speeded things touch various vaccine companies, assessing data went rather following usual steps assess treatment one one usually do, fact groups working assessing stage concurrently.

Many MPs UK celebs already saying take vaccine live TV encourage people take it. Already surveys suggest around 70% people say it, around 20% prob wont 10% undecided looks like nation high takeup . exactly you’ve never flown never fly life? drive car? take ferry? 24/7 streaming would work - like hurricanes Also misusing trite. think invalidates statement. get saying may want consult dictionary use especially considering trying condescend fails mess common words. Sounds like you’re 2-4 weeks behind us U.K. thankfully closer together lot fewer us enough healthcare workers + 75 January think downvoted come across fearmongering. ... full dissidents all. 7 million march? Thats disastrous. BRUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCE! Lol going generation known wear masks public spaces decades? 

I honestly cannot imagine going without mask hand sanitizer anymore tbh. Getting hit learning noroviruses going pandemic definitely changed outlook public spaces. personal space also expanded.

I wonder long carry   Politicians genuinely wondering riskier flying patients? DVT deep vein thrombosis, known happen flights due long periods sitting still. Live events here. don’t know I’ll job even if. company may gone get back work. said months back too, interesting he's still looking like ahead us we're yet get lucky, participate risky behavior. reason public health protocols masks, social distancing, proper hygiene, sanitization, testing exist. 

There people going maskless bars weddings trying shame someone 100% compliant public health measures. believe that's pronounced 'Field Hospitals'. Yep, agree. think realistic expectation. Maryland State Police stopped mother son boarding flight BWI - even though recently tested gotten results. county health official called MSP kid tested positive. cops stopped right boarded. Never forget Redfield pushing supporting Trump pandemic policies several months. U-turn finally remembered swore Hippocratic Oath, probably Fauci pull side remind him. Something Atlas still remembered yet. Yeah honestly plausible, alone. though.

With comparison comparing explicitly death toll per day reactions society it.

It adequate accurate. like comparing flu make false statements like ""its like flu"", ""more people die flu"". data going screwed last week week. Definitely missing backlog getting captured numbers. 

Next week likely first 'clean' data week there's chance might already start capturing bump Thanksgiving. Likely following week though. I’m supposed seeing Scorpions five months now. Wish luck! really surprising thing. Every government point whatever necessary stop significant enough threat country; governments allowances emergency powers. zombie apocalypse type event bet government would bring complete lockdown martial law snap fingers; debate whether Covid point kind response happen there's serious enough threat eventually happen, depending level risk particular government tolerate.

Also, problem many government overreach arguments pretty much consider kind mitigation overreach. US, levels government tried impose restrictions possible, usually people refused follow kind non-mandated recommendations things obviously getting control. US least simply true imply government going take everyone's freedom away drop hat whenever there's kind threat. ppl get depressed looking sub Buddy, reason mess first everybodies else way life. never fixed attitude dependent getting back “normal life” #you first.

Just kidding. I’ve quarantine since March 13th, 2020. I’ve left property two months. We’ve visitors. “IM pATriOt. MeRIcA!”

As scoff 271k counting deaths Americans. taking single example bureaucracy paying something calling win, yet get big hospital bill insurance cover tell tough luck, better start GoFundMe. amount logical thinking going change mind hardcore anti-vaxxers. Theres good deal people deny earth round say dinosaurs lived people whatever bullshit choose believe.  think quite like that. envision stadiums going 10% capacity, 25%, 50%,  etc. time goes on. first big concert tours awesome. 

EDIT:. take back. Football February. next season starts September, everything back 100%.  definitely big. Tough work retail. im pretty sure teenage girls got pregnant man wete put jail parents pursued it.

This false assumption making without looking data. Additionally parents pursue criminal charges rape there. feelijg guilty every damn person prison wrongly. 

I'm feeling guilty. recognize acting like people advocating denied life changing vaccine child rapists murders accurate. Yes exist prisons jails. dont fail comprehend anything. know people wrongly put prison. talking less 10%

You actually know made random also go prison low amounts rec drugs dwis.

Actually do. say would do? Vote *this other* sociopath? Yeah country bigger general ""fuck you, got mine"" attitude USA China. Everyone running kind scam. make much difference me. I'm anti-social anyway, I'm 17th day. Oh. Ouch. Sorry that.

Good luck stay safe. I'm stupid fucking pandemic everything online. supposed Dr appointment today duo video chat. guess notifications calls show up. Finally 40 minutes waiting checked app 3 missed calls. feel upset I've literally never ""no showed"" appointment life going charge show fee could barely afford copay. can't wait go regular damn doctor visit video chat. Hmm control people lung disease drop o2 even regular cold? o2 drops everything tbh. also fuck people can’t work home last line vaccine.  Witch one fake virus colored hat train? cube t? pretty unlikely. totally oblivious population movement controls emphasis masking handwashing get virus wipe completely four months, start get again. yup... completely ignore man oxygen rest life. think that's impacted quality life all? No? big deal?

its big deal, extremely detrimental non-death consequences auto-accidents well, yet closing highways, limiting amount cars road, setting arbitrary curfews. seatbelts, good- like masks good.  completely ignore man oxygen rest life. think that's impacted quality life all? No? big deal?

 rate similar diagnosis non-covid years compared 2020? age? Pre-existing conditions? Smoker?

Lot context numbers continue rise rise even get vaccine.

the numbers listed percentages, zero sum scenario. age groups numbers rise? one rises another ignorance arrogance reveals lack care anyone yourself. perhaps also reveals fact could scared shitless need puff chest pretend like everything's ok. not, could people like fuck up.

why can't agree disagree? personal attacks assumptions? I'm talking per capita - measure used entire world. US utterly failed pandemic response. Flinging random ratios look mildly good help you. get false positive test? want get two weeks paid time off. raw Hospital Bill though Remember didn’t shut world isolated incident?

Also measles 5-7x infectious covid. part statement: ""I need help responding this."" question? asked ""how responded?"". I'm sure? Instead find frustrated attempt learn something gets censored. seems like poor dangerous way managing things. post wrong full inaccuracies simply show understand others come across it. can't disprove guy said can't even discuss it. America, prefer say fuck people struggling lost jobs. would rather inconvenience wealthiest paying little taxes would socialism. Depends are. live austin everyones pretty good. Everyone mask stores lot mask hiking trails such. Theres still bars open though :/ gyms open well. Austins numbers pretty decent though.

The rest texas much worse terms conpliance numbers know lockdowns effective.

Cant spread without people interacting.

But don’t like really bad economy. Interpretation results contradict perception “yet defined” post-COVID syndrome predominantly affects middle-aged adults suggest exercise intolerance, dyspnea, chest pain, chemosensory impairment, lymphadenopathy, rhinitis, appetite loss may differentiate post-COVID syndrome general symptoms pandemic, age, academic related stress. findings also consistent previous reports females vulnerable post viral syndrome. Large-scale population-based studies essential discerning magnitude characterization post-COVID syndrome young adults well diverse longer wait, old conservatives either die get lifelong debilitating consequences.  say.  say all. Stay safe there. :) arrest

So quarantine. NYC: ""Oh, reason. reason all."" */s* Better stay house forever never come out. Covid hysteria synonymous flat earthers point late. already it. Whore man walks urban scape something catches eye. panel, usually showed coke ad, changed. 

A woman returning desk home, hears something different news channel.

A boy asked heard what’s new.

A caregiver gives sigh pure relief.

A teacher anxious tell colleagues news.

A man jumps joy Kyoto.

A frenchman hears shouts wife returns home.

A man Ecuador told news friend.

A man Melbourne AU hears news radio works.

A woman embraces wife relief.

The camera pans scene first man. panel reads: “COVID-19 Vaccine Set Released” approved yet stop spread virus. nope, it.

It stops virus entering type 2 cel ( cel designed bind to) preventing replicating entirely.

Prevents formation cytokins (which causes respiratory failure)

Increases production surfactant layer lungs increasing ability repair transmit oxygen air lungs seem confused vaccine works. surprised.

You read vaccines work instead thinking like flu vaccine. Especially making claims That’s dumb statement I’ve ever heard one. elected officials go buy hookers drugs, mean too? something, doesn’t mean too. probably unrealistic.

But say president hides critical facts ""doesn't want create panic"" saving moments like this. Fauci overly optimistic way us hope very, sad two months facing US. completely inconsequential. Nobody's lives lost saying this.

Anyway, can't see could happen considering gigantic part population refuse it. mention even deserve first shipments (besides healthcare workers. some.) understanding, intentionally shifting.

When risk taking behavior potential affect people adverse ways rights restricted via legal means.

If drive drunk go jail. That's communist China, direct response societal refusal accept loss life drunk driving incidents.

We can't couch mask wearing light variety reasons similar concept. refuse wear mask increase probability virus spread. Increased probability spread directly correlated increase case load directly correlated excess mortality.

More people dying *need* result people expecting personal rights always held greater good. direct causal influence.

We're talking math, feeling, we're talking elevated risk result spreading disease.

If going tell traditional American thinking 'fuck neighbors want get sick risk adversity appropriate me', actually advocating appear see, casting Americans positive light.

This example logical choice would best everyone would everyone wear mask; likelihood spreading disease lowered, thereby lowering health burden resulting excess mortality.

If come back response apply logical argument facts supporting effectively said 'logic damned, give rights.'

We're back square one. bad doubt allowed remain final release. like they're truly independent Trump's meddling. Chinese attacking nations Africa every chance get? aren’t talking individual treatments here. 
Individually yet see country free racism. Yes it’s fucked issue one seem even trying fix it. going post another thread another user. Dunno quote I’ll copy paste it. 

“Re long term effects:

1.	⁠Long term effects modern vaccination much thing, ones I'm aware couple issues may may linked H1N1 vaccines, namely type nerve problem called GBS type sleep disorder called narcolepsy, vaccine trigger them, manifest within 2-3 months, max. ""effects years road"" never observed, despite lot monitoring.
2.	⁠Both mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines believed safer traditional vaccines, deliver Covid signature spike whole dead virus like H1N1 flu vaccines (The flu vaccine might possibly trigger GBS/narcolepsy flu able trigger GBS/narcolepsy, vaccine supposed mimic infection, times immune system over-reacts). spike vaccines lot targeted, much less likely over-stimulate immune system cause neurological issues.
3.	⁠To fair skeptics, mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines relatively new, know way cause problems mean risk free. However, general public expected get vaccinated next spring, nearly year data first batch volunteers.” said graphs clones other, similar one period last 5 weeks. proof work, that’s that’s actually needed. Examples situations mitigation icing cake. Imagine seeing Corona Pandemic: Movie cinemas story, secret plan ending actually totally different dark-ish government told population. Nightmare surprising, look username take well - EU genuinely fragile right interest look like they're stringent wantaway UK. don’t think anyone wants MRNA trigger autoimmune problems partly they've approved before. top know mRNA interact pre existing medical conditions.

It seem like people semi forced it/be given 1 chance vaccinated local hospital basically said 'get stocks last'. Sounds like unable get say, fucked, especially places require proof vaccine. Thanks sharing. really interesting. Glad see things like happening somewhere world. wonderful know governments care look citizens. nonsense asymptomatic people threat...asymptomatic carriers driving spread. Deliveries family visitors avoided lik right bow. Inspections ans administrations part jail system vaccinate. interactions mainly guards prisoners. Cut almost 0% chance infections. 
Its like punishing prisoners restrictions. Prisoners allowed out. bubble. Guards get go home interact others. number guards significantly lower number prisoners. 

Its view prisoners. It’s vaccine shortages first second vaccination wave. need elect carefully. 

Its nursing homes. Keep mursing home residents bubble. nursing staff administration vaccinated. alone HUGE effect mortality. 

We cant vaccinate people already bubble. need vaccinate people whose job forced interact others essential society function. thats far little far late... want see numbers healthcare workers. nurse assistant, long covid fired recover taking ‘too long’, even tho undergoing tests Doctors. many healthcare workers boat? know nurses (and assume nurse assitants) dying much higher rate general public, would guess long Covid prevalent us too—and perhaps people returning work early causing things like heart attacks post viral syndrome. 170K 20MM residents

A bit 1% going people us. Lol sub full bloomer mode lately. gave shit way pray it.  mask mandate, financially support workers, push back members political party reinforced false ideas.

There absolutely nothing Christ-like this.  pass leper say ""I'll pray you."" fucking healed him.

Fictional not, proclaim follow Christ everything power prevent illness spreading allow people charged getting us better safely less trauma. approve sometime month well doubt it'll make much difference tbh. oral Polio vaccine given kids Africa. actually causing small amount people actually get Polio Chronically ill since birth here. shitty year can't get proper maintenance care due COVID I've developed new chronic issue top several issues becoming worse. mornings struggle jumping bed jumping roof. 

You people want fuck around find out, I'll tell much. shake head anti maskers they'll find real quick die, they'll eternal reminder peace they've lost. taking long? shots ready go right now. keep closed indefinitely even covid gone? right know long immunity last, know last longer immunity all. Perhaps vaccine require booster time, like many vaccines. Perhaps even need yearly, like flu vaccines. surmountable problem. 

We evidence mRNA vaccines interact existing medical conditions. However, AMPLE evidence COVID-19 *does*. 

All vaccines risk vs benefit equation. COVID-19 killing thousands people every day. causing potential long-term disability countless others. destroyed global economies, put millions work. risk vaccine nonexistent, far outweighed risks letting pandemic continue. exactly worries :) could lockdowns aren’t effective? would strange mistake vaccine producers make. take mRNA virus use make vaccine. put wrong code, body would use manufacture wrong protein. targeting anything. mRNA vaccine taken cells blue print make virus' signature spike protein, harmless itself, body recognize foreign problem, generate specific immunity it. vaccine mRNA decays quickly that, like mRNA do. next time body see spike, virus attached end, immune system recognize destroy rapidly.

It might help thinking mRNA vaccine JPG file get sent cells, cells use print picture virus (the signature spike protein), show immune system, immune system look picture scan facial recognition software. there, long term immunity, original JPG file destroyed body. chance cases may start spike Christmas winter last wave there's issues rolling ten eighty times mean yeah worst First World Country Earth, even true Democracy lmao Try black person China revisit racism discussion.

I swear honestly truly trapped fuckin basements. helps populist conservative leader biggest province taking crisis somewhat seriously, admonishing break rules. He's Trump-like many respects wife probably gave earful mother-in-law nursing home caught it. Certainly he's done better messaging far-right Alberta counterpart, even people causing huge spikes Toronto elsewhere. mean yeah would be. I’m literally group would potentially affected course care more. access data none us yet. couldn’t way. suggest? Genuinely curious. Ask question would've answer it. 

The first thing realize insurance helpful people. people anything else moot.

I can't reason anyone opinion reason to. US needs get shit together man I’m tired don’t make choice based ignorance information already there.

This. time make decision, I'm going lot reading mRNA vaccines, little reading done far, - theory atleast - seems quite safe. maybe indeed tad bit paranoid. You’re still weighing certainty risking vaccine side effects possibility getting covid it’s side effects.

As young, healthy person quarantining entire year - I’d rather continue stay home get neither. didn’t, doesn’t change are, math. desire continue living ""New Normal."" optics. thinks he's fooling people. true, post source. GTAV new DLC comes 15 too, Dun dun dun. That's teams sense government. guys doses secured yet? you’re bad me, might want talk doctor.

The longer pandemic goes on, worse gets me. double take think, ""hey wtf back idiot"" see people shaking hands stuff TV, get plain old anxious scenes parties whatever.

Please go live China, I'm begging you. eyes... know. think trial would done Jan, dunno. Yeah. read form statistical report theorized extrapolated worst possible case China might lied half reported infections spring, something like that.

But comparison, US reaching error amount reported cases like literally every two days so? Largely apples oranges though. Many countries restrictions lockdowns changed curve didn’t cause decline. people generally following rules; that’s flu rate much lower usual. Yeah, guy wanted team apparently “meant” regards voting. guy idiot never team (he didn’t know RT Russian propaganda, come on). I'm 37 heart patient.

Plus cat enjoyed eating it. Oh trust me...there’s people yell us wanting “microchip” people...but “thanks” every makes Yes, curry real thing UK. huge swathes population unwilling treat pandemic seriously take mitigation measures, mass rollout vaccines might best course action. looking relatively rare incidences potentially serious side effects vs. hundreds thousands dead, point many governments willing take gamble.

We making choice world taken seriously. dollar day year, sick thing make huge difference. health insurance US, don’t think I’m getting money’s worth.

Then still buy it? problem is, underemployed also starving. They're starving partially employed. think normal, sane person would argue fact virus real dangerous

There loads people denying COVID exists *as dying it.* Hell, I'm nursing student I've seen much denial head spinning. can't imagine people working COVID patients experiencing.

I agree questions terrifying government overreach (e.g. mandatory vaccines whatever home-counting bullshit NJ trying push), question rational discussion two reasonable sides. There's good chunk country blindingly, suicidally ignorant, rest us trying find middle ground. dude weekly $600 + regular UI, literally getting double normal income. go back work.

Lets wait results see conclusions.

I worked entire pandemic, took 25-30% hit income year too, absolutely support anyone took unemployment pandemic. idea jealous unemployed people got bucks struggling find work pathetic weak. Trump go America's Nero, golfing nation burns, case asphyxiates... ""Rose 61%, 155 398""

Someone claims was. looked personally information available. Honest question, ""honorable mentions"" ever become thing, recognition exist discipline-adjacent breakthroughs?

My train thought asking that, vaccine might substantively Nobel-able first instance, submit we're witness one humanity's finest hours specific respect *truly leviathan-scale* logistical feats manufacturing, storing, shipping, distributing, administering perishable, multiple-dose, temperature-volatile vaccine exist twenty-five weeks ago, carries temperature-controlled shipping storage requirements almost entirely unparalleled quantities / deadlines play here. This'll simply triumph industry manufacturing, be, least part, milestone triumph human history.

I also caution focus accolades beleaguered everyperson front line workers / cargo handler / HVAC-storage technicians instead shining yet another shoe so-called ""titans industry"" actually reap capitalism windfalls triumph.

I intuitively understand Nobel Committee probably conduit act recognition, guess I'm essentially asking focus type attention weeks months come? Time Magazine's People Year award, maybe? Yeah FDA approved yet, longer wait. would think FDA would efficient U.K. least. That's generally mean say trouble breathing. could get blood oxygen meter want quantified measure though. USA needs pass bill Right. Always people little free liking. honestly hope changes culture normalize people wearing masks they're sick. Flu season would much easier. Also, imagine another covid came around people infected put masks social distanced like flu... Probably way less transmission. Fuck astros it’s company behaving company doesn’t mean situation isn’t fucked up. That’s like saying price gouging insulin isn’t fucked companies want profit. think hardest part me.

That’s back head first. remembered whole Ebola panic like, 3 people US. 

God good thing 3 considering badly handled virus I'm arguing do. I'm saying large chunk Americans things harm them, directly indirectly, *feel*. Logic science damned. United States set record number people currently hospitalized Covid-19, according Covid Tracking Project.
 
On Tuesday, 98,691 Covid-19 patients hospitalized, according CTP. This highest number Covid-19 hospitalizations nation ever experienced.
 
Per CTP, double number hospitalizations reported Nov. 1, triple number hospitalizations reported Oct. 1.
 
Today’s count than 60% increase peaks spring summer, according CTP data.
 
According CTP data, highest hospitalization numbers are:

Dec. 1: 98,691

Nov. 30: 96,053

Nov. 29: 93,265

Nov. 28: 91,665

Nov. 26: 90,443  Plenty research suggests immunity COVID last 6-12+ months contracting virus. seems variable vaccine though Fauci still recommends getting it. yeah, people going help ton herd immunity numbers regardless study looking at.  Fair point though know they're actually limited accessory supplies right now. another site manufacture actual vaccine would take lot validation qualification prove safely consistently. hard modelling problem, assumption probably wrong places: want vaccinate elderly first, super-spreaders. drops reproductive rate largest amount, enabling suppression.

Of course, US suppressing, may exception. fun that.  vaccines ""announced"" (insofar they've active development) since March ETA winter-spring since then. appear thin air. President Vice-President elect first people get jabs preferably live primetime television. really need leaked map tell us that? December 2020, mRNA vaccine, drug, technology platform, ever approved use humans, 2020, mRNA considered theoretical experimental candidate use humans. Thanks comment. reason thread removed. ""Evil"" running state like Nazi Germany... I'm sure small business owner would much rather South Dakota fascist directorship Whitmer running. need leaked available public? Lol they're like 500 cases day. Get outta devastated this. Goodbye Why, dear god would travel he’s ft emergency room doctor town???? I’m trying hard judgey, wow. wow. probably is, yes, court would side atheists/agnostics/non-praying-religious-folks. :( gonna keep sending long haul covid stories till say anecdotal concern people.who get die. winter masks enough. can't play God sure mandate get child MMR, Hep tetanus shots declared unfit parent vaccinated whether like literally child neglect. Similarly Covid vaccine comes employers including federal government fire you. certainly make spreading dangerous, false antivaccine material serious crime land jail. legal powers government regards ensuring public health, especially super spreading diseases like Measles Covid immense. Thanks posting this! Yeah even herd immunity start see drastic improvements hospitalizations deaths. Assuming triaged correctly, first 60 million people get vaccine spring ones would likely hospitalized dead. doesn’t campaign much next year look facts, US 12th world cases per 1M (44k) people, canada 89th (10k). yeah, Canada better, 4x better going cases per million people. nope, beavers building dams fast can. alligators stacked holding pattern awaiting landing clearance. Common sense? saw ignorance. people luxury sealing 10 months without human contact. this, even dude told dad work... he's still parroting junk.

So earned downvotes. voted meeting one slides showed next phase essential workers. phase adults high risk medical conditions 65 older. Corrections officers listed example essential workers mention prisoners. could potentially iron next phase gets closer. want move Florida able vote man. even American. We’re cases per day, that’s still expected deaths per new cases per day 0.01% CFR. kind monster write inconsequential? wouldn’t retroactively. would anyone documented contracting prior set date. much dead comedian listen mr sclauwb talk corona big deal I’ve already seen comments like “this Biden’s America” stories high positivity rates certain areas news stories. Baffling. people slating guy losers teenagers dont know real life thought avoiding didn’t like fascism? 

I’m struggling this. Trump would another impeachment hearing, want Biden wield authority said fascist? Lmao dropped two tabs acid night kept going onto balcony thinking al bars restaurants stores shut one majority people home blew mind DeSantis went say, ""We known destination retirees, want die."" 30,000 size Moderna clinical trials. sure whether 30,000 got though. DPA make everyone else also. GM.can making needles syringes etc. It’s mind boggling. would think unconstitutional. only, even one dozen, incidents like this. one Los Angeles also done day restrictions went force. point remains: many officials place restrictions place actions conceding either a) worried odds contracting virus b) worried effects virus contract it. sad people understand ""minuscule"" fractions MASSIVE whole (330,000,000 Americans) quickly turns horrific numbers!! ONE child world someone!!! That’ll help. fucking love it, install shit toronto. Noem may attractive, highest calling served South Dakota’s “Snow Queen”. dumb rock totally insensitive. buried grandmother last week claims Covid related. delusional enough think chance national stage silly misinformed policy ideas. Get clue lady. Drive hour west Vancouver won’t get far car bottom Georgia Straight. turns caring vs. caring make one bit difference corona virus.

Biden's 5-point plan identical Trump's plan. difference instead *allow governors make policies masks*, plans *allow governors make policies masks encourage so*. That's *literally* difference two politicians' plans. doesn’t look like we’re going sunset coverage crap people vaccinated without medical exception.

Not disagree premise (in fact would extend people refuse distance wear masks) know would able realistically anyway since tens millions people infected even *chance* vaccine.  Could 70% come already infected well number account percentage needs vaccinated? post misinformation. would never come close number. implies 100% students get virus, never happen.    remember end February parents sister laughing said maybe shouldn’t go visit LA virus. 

Then day fly home LA county declares public health emergency Gov't slow fuck. approve dang thing already. Ask them, suggestions! “I want something you. schedule grocery delivery, meal favorite restaurant laundry service?” restrictions loosened time dining happened. Teachers tentatively next phase along essential workers. No, vaccines gives everyone.

Not sure normal be. Wait mask maditory open viewing comedy show. Someone call r/BrandNewSentence look like? thought Dr. got canceled? Well, great me. got tested Saturday still gotten results three days later.

Fortunately, going symptoms cold, still. Actually, I’m not. I’m smart enough know area expertise life nothing vaccines, keep mouth shut doctors tell me.  Honestly depends many get vaccinated, everything goes planned could conventions concerts packed theme parks sometime late April early May. issues distributing vaccines one takes them, could take Fall/Winter end? companies already going making vaccine quickly possible. heard?

The French Laundry highest Michelin rating 3 stars, regularly placed among top restaurants world.  stopped daily check thing, also working grocery store, interact hundreds people every day, still gotten ping all. isnt enough users app. asthma smoke enough weed knock gorilla every day. usually dip 92-93 smoking shortly I'm fine. tested blood oxygen curious. issues probably fine. say, do, obviously. mean vaccine announced shortly election Lol Name calling, nice. land suitable draining? hear lot people experience draining swamps entering workforce soon. Awesome work Donald! /s Fellow Minnesota here. many people seem think absolutely need go bar, cross border continue enjoy experience. Maybe, could get ""need"", bringing back MN! numbers far higher? got tested via hospital drive almost 2 weeks ago never got result. 3 days calling leaving voice mails several departments explaining work hospital, finally look result. predictably negative. say that? actually small part virus itself. delivered body makes immune system recognizes it. virus also this, whole virus. serious problems 30,000 enrollees Moderna trial. Vaccines, basically never cause long term problems. safe people ""just want wait see"" understanding works. Capital C cunt I’m convinced there’s secretly Canadian death penalty give Canadians acting rude otherwise bringing shame Canada.

All Canadians meet polite thoughtful, even tense negotiations.

The rude Canadians I’ve ever met Geese suspect got quietly (and perhaps improperly) deported USA. Speaking honest truth people like make sick leave kids safty home untill actually make difference. guess based family back Texas. won’t admit know anyone COVID anyone hospital, can’t seem help know someone died. That’s thing seems land serious is. Everything minimized discussed. read local newspaper Facebook see obituaries, it’s harder deny. going sound exceptionally callous, live nursing homes live long major spreaders disease. might effective prioritize essential workers 50s 60s susceptible spread easily. Obviously every life matters I'm saying nursing homes deserve die, limited number vaccines need consider effective. ""Oh no! Quick, make symptoms worse!"" like Shadows vampires. 
I'd prefer battle hoard legend vampires. beginning end. understanding provisional list first batch care home residents workers second batch health social care workers everyone 80. works 5 year increments 65, vaccinating higher risk 65. works 50, point half population vaccinated. Yeah think that's probably gotta expected city size. Always going percentage people one claim die. They've thoseass graves hundreds years dig certain amount years 9f decomposition. Potter Island name believe. Depends still receiving immunosuppresive therapy associated breast cancer. Unfortunately immunity covid isn’t thing second time get it’s always worse. I’m sorry. Ditto Kentucky. Three tests total. One symptoms, two safe giving blood volunteering polls. negative, hopefully truthfully. Never hurts couple extra hands deck goblin shows Leaked 😂😂🤣🤣 Executed? lol peak reddit. I’m high risk dad. suspect may COVID since symptoms. got tested afternoon. manage quarantining home? I’m confined room can’t get food without assistance. one family get things me. touch something (say fork) sister uses fork, given virus? 

I suspect could end hospital COVID. wait going getting treatment, go need it? know supplies limited. Ultimately -70C freezers rare demand, complexity making them. Cascade cooling really simple barely complex normal freezer unit. cold side phase change unit links hot side second phase change unit. THat's really is, 2 sometimes 3 phase change units chain.

Production distribution freezers done pretty quickly. importantly central areas cities still vaccinate large portions population locations city. Ideal creating queues shit done relatively little infrastructure. Vaccinating rest country much harder vaccinating heavily cities naturally slow spread significantly. Fairly viable months put together lorries extra fuel supply board freezing units start rolling around country village village.

Ideal easy first world countries absolutely viable doable, absolutely.

Also several types vaccine made require normal temps around -3/5c mark normal freezer. top actually know long vaccine last higher temps. seem mostly focused producing stable best working vaccine first, they've already stated conduct trials see long viable store higher temperature. still stable week two normal freezer temp make much easier again.

Overall cascade freezers big obstacle get comes getting vaccine there. Production capacity likely thing slowing distribution. We're almost reaching end horrible nightmare. Great job, UK!

Next up: countries world. question I'm going deny claim. got mine dealing antimaskers Covid deniers expressed anger brother died exposed someone refused wear mask go me, yes. know her. yes, brother years . gender reveals getting sub Trust Brexit wouldn’t want Hundreds thousands. Yeah, remember reddit seeing videos doctors Wuhan crying phone, desperate help. felt ominous then, idea would become. serious? We’re *so far* behind. FDA trying make sure review data correctly everything’s good vaccine. They’re literally meeting next week approval shouldn’t far behind. Let’s happy them. guess Brexit starting show perks - UK starts vaccinating citizens early next week. Meanwhile EU ""makes decision"" 27 Dec. Ffs Agree completely, unfortunately governor anything like that. entire point flattening curve hospitals getting overwhelmed otherwise. someone 65 emphysema history breast cancer fall mix? people believe misinformation Facebook believe anything says. owns platform, opinions expressed propaganda people spread it. he's really serious helping, could address misinformation spread. Thanks, want waffles. 😂😂 vaccine really compatible infrastructure complex logistics poorer countries. AZ/Oxford one better fit already mass produced Serum Institute India. single dose Jansen candidate would better still. 

COVAX one organisation looking countries would otherwise struggle get access expensive vaccines. U.K. countries also donate millions doses. Let's see goes. able get idea next year. Yeah, ""ideal vaccine"" would also confer 100% protection, zero incidence averse reactions storable indefinitely conditions.

 Let us allow perfect enemy good here. One time? total? Yes,the end beginning beginning end. might right. European news sources read seemed imply 29th possible date. politicians also seem switched going date, longer saying December vaccination happen. Congrats UK, built well function government department! didn’t even know possible.

 ~ Ron Swanson (paraphrased) Well thats unsettling Love science. think meant gender reveals That's great. Kinda pissed appearently take longer Germany EU countires reason. really get behind progress progress guess. beginning end church mask less planners? Absolutely. Plus last thing covid patient needs working stressing kicking immune system stupid employer says don’t test yet. That's pretty much nonsense, world vested interest third world staying fit healthy providing basically slave labour, even actual slave labour labour piss cheap.

The world runs farms, produce goods made workers making next nothing wages. get sick economy goes shit yeah, first world countries provide vaccine though largely extremely selfish, capitalist directly moral reasons.

Multiple countries companies put money together plans provide vaccines either free cost places can't afford it. work private clinic. Two weeks ago relaxed policy taking anyone tested positive within 10 day window (so instead honor system least, see patients say it).

One week ago main receptionist hospitalized covid. Saturday sedated placed ventilator. 

This Monday management seemed perplexed staff asking go back seeing positive patients answered resoundly no. I'm deliriously happy.

If weed I'd running around naked right now. okay like money especially double digit unemployment rate skyrocketing rent prices typical scientific caution, data seems pretty suggestive.

"" analyzing samples, CDC scientists found antibodies 39 samples California, Oregon, Washington state collected Dec. 13 Dec. 16, along 67 samples antibodies Massachusetts, Michigan, Wisconsin Iowa, Connecticut Rhode Island, collected Dec. 30 Jan. 17. ""

Since antibody detection, also implies actual infection occurred time that. necessarily asking, pointing obtained first authorization still access whole data.

It would've good idea Pfizer make publicly accessible, show bona fide allow everyone build trust them. honestly feel like anxiety vitamin deficiency sound like main issues moment. trying give internet diagnosis NAD, try breathe monitor symptoms develop seem develop. Also check family members see everyone doing. Odds 20 would asymptomatic exposed contracted covid pretty low. Would decrease PPE requirements all?  Haha. gotta gauge room. actually never happened United States. There's always mass Graves unclaimed dead NYC pictures saw one back March/April routine regardless of. virus. There's specific island NY. OSHA useless. UK approving today, there’s doubt mind vaccine approved day two FDA meets 10th. end closer.  ""just move"" thing similiar fact I’m 20 autistic, can’t drive take public transit order bring groceries back apartment.
The people big fun parties gatherings masks, screaming taking public transit saying dangerous covid saying ""JuSt GeT LiCeNsE""

Staying date news virus really doesn’t help. would honestly say real cause people’s mental health dropping. Wohoo! that? Winning concerned know Finally good data. People care. Schools fully item time like ""needles say"" Even optimistic. IFR seems around 1%, average medical care.


The CFR stayed 3%, (still) testing enough. hospitals full, think likely numbers double.


Positive test results reported right away, deaths take longer certify, even happen hospital. 


Also **390k people died directly result respiratory infections far US 2020. That's 56% deaths reported**. covid weakens immune system damages lungs, another pneumonia comes finishes job. That's viruses tend work. Hence (actual) IFR 1%.

Source:  long y’all think take reach US? Lmao stupid human centipede ouroboros trump somewhere middle told would stop November 4th. fuck? ^(/s) think less divisive POTUS, response bad.

It's even party thing. Look Bush post 9/11. plenty flaws, wake tragedy Bush good job bringing country together. Whether agree beyond point, Bush *united* people, least while. Trump's entire strategy revolves divisive, firing combative elements party ""fight"" opposition.

If Biden get people moving back towards page, I'd consider bigger success Obama. actually expect (Biden seems competent enough, *crazy* tall order require wrangling Facebook anything), it'd nice. they're talking ass mean think stupid enough kind thing question  don’t care anymore. vaccine available public someone wants it, it’s longer concern. I’m making choices vaccine hesitant losers mind. Thats gonna help  Yeah, response says, guess it’s partly numbers - heard radio something like 10+m old ppl UK (I think said 13 14m). remain vulnerable massively disruptive - homes lockdown, infection risks outbreak home often multiple lives lost, putting really pressure local services several ppl one home need intensive treatment once; there’s obviously emotional toll families old person, practical difficulty emotional toll health social workers looking them. Tbh feels like relative home basically prison, it’s v sad. Take younger vulnerable ppl, many live independent lives shielding possible (though also isolating disruptive agree). (I think) ticking old care-dependent people quick relieves massive burden whole system. Vulnerable ppl clearly need follow soon IMHO. Keep mind big reason takes long time vaccine trials require people infected naturally take forever disease low prevalence. Obviously covid addressed issue. UK say ""says"" what? Let think I’m stupid. COVID don’t get sick do, we’ll see stupid ones were. First, couple weeks lot long time relative timescale pandemic vaccine deployment.

Second, FDA proposed stricter guidelines fall, White House pushed back eventually approved. Without guidelines, likely would already approval. is, wait another 10 days so.

No comment delay affected election—it certainly made highly politicized headlines—or value guidelines worth excess deaths incurred additional time needed seek approval. Sure, open country back up. immune system A1. can’t get corona virus would nice guys linked removed article well. scroll 5 pages find article ""It is.""  actually talked quite people saying they're waiting first waves guinea pig it.

This really meaningful they're people would otherwise vaccinated first waves. us waiting anyway there's lot people line ahead us terms priority. 

In practical terms I'm counting available July August myself. know official timeline little ahead allowing predictable hitches slowdowns think late summer realistic. point think anyone completely taking feel lot better (assuming course vaccines turned safe effective currently appears may be) going ahead. Thin herd Christmas even gathering holiday Thanksgiving,

Yup. I'm skipping skipping Christmas definitely harder skipping Thanksgiving. historically, Americans travel longer distances Thanksgiving Xmas. [Nothing fails like wanting young children forced live life opposite pursuit happiness two years selfish. don’t care selfish think am. comply mask distance guidelines responsible health - I’m tired living government nanny state movement restricted (even choice would go out). Lmao  so....is AstraZeneca one mRNA? live central ish PA ""lockdown"" back beginning. still go work work wastewater plant. Every. Single. Day lockdown roads looked normal even traffic normal way work. memorial day hit scheduled work holiday. saw 2 vehicles whole way work day. That's expecting see ""lockdown"" seemed people leave get dunkin donuts starbucks. go work holiday, essential. Stay fuck home. see comment someone said caught post. Surface transmission rarer occur. Perhaps, case, Brexit advantage? Well there’s still lot time vaccine goes arms normal folks. Yeah mostly used gene therapy side effects usually appears years after. (In case gene therapy, benefits often worth risks, case vaccine ?). Wondering Brexit manages complicate things vaccine distribution, domestic abroad EU. man entitled sweat brow? 'No!' says man Washington, '​It belongs poor.'

Washington needs man right asked say hospitals empty It’s fake news.

I one person agree 250k Americans died 3-4 deaths day. weird math perspective. 

They even believed CDC data, cited deaths last 7 days didn’t hear back.

It’s really bizarre guess get news random websites say “main stream media” source non credible. dunno many people seem affected propaganda it’s insane. Don’t believe memes people. admit feelings months ago. understandable, since vaccine like never done quick. optics look good usually takes literal years, one sped less year. going wait years vaccine, thinking wait months continue isolate extra cautious been. 

But looked more. found many steps concurrently instead one other, like normal, they've testing longer realized. things put far ease. Sharing little bit research instead shaming people needs done. wait vulnerable access first, that's supply meet demand. ""leaked"" big secret. joke. Basically yes mate, me.. Like someone else said post people living fear subreddit see vaccine saving grace. They're putting eggs basket There’s way virus bad say is. I’ve going gym since July one wears masks haven’t gotten it. Also people know gotten said little sick that. shit control. say open everything back like normal end BS already. It’s time  *Cries Tier 3* Hmm. Thanks clearing up. great marketing though. make sure freezers covered lots company branding photos social media. mostly democratic lead cities! 

Actually concerning AOC much Covid. That's probably Trump Whitehouse ignored long. I’ve researching numbers Manitoba. Looks like Winnipeg’s problem started outbreak two areas large majority nurses live. nurses brought virus care homes hospitals continued spread kill. care homes got stabilized numbers Winnipeg began stabilize drop.... I'm ""one them"". prefer take every position account dismiss people stupid uninformed fears like this. Again, they're scared. want assurances stuff like happen they're distrustful enough politicians like they're fearful. believe hot second proposed Great Reset anything nearly nefarious extremists claim 

Perhaps not, wise immediately dismiss either. Keep eye looks turning bad direction, act pretty big jump go buying coffee company vending machine opening mag-swipe doors mind control

I never mentioned mind control. ""take thing participating society"". logic immunity passports. people terrified, comes sorts ways, they're absolutely terrified type thing happening culmination previous fears happening. say address fears instead shunning them.

Feels like long ago now. residency become lab medicine physician? hope kitchen gave boogers n cum Oh, hate classroom. I'm 13 weeks pregnant terrified also need job so...

As singing: speak Catholic Churches, taken singing mass time being. There's someone play organ *maybe* single cantor wears mask/face shield sings psalm....but congregational singing allowed anywhere I've heard of. Hopefully recover quickly without symptoms. could done within weeks. Use time advance job related skills, see work provide guidance. Depending industry there’s often slew courses give actual long term benefits. Worse Sweden? No. Huge weeks UK round - Protein folding cracked one leading tech companies (which could unimaginable benefits medicine), Oxford vaccine still looking good (and far accessible developing nations) (say whisper) Brexit deal done end week. 

Could looked back one generations time one important four weeks modern history. I’m curious vaccine aka last months, year, years? enough specifics part answer “we won’t know it’s distributed”. Bring it! Although I’m sure size 46 feet provide superior footing hurricane! Lmao isn’t even r/nhl even better Nah shouldn’t week behind UK. That’s ridiculous shows uneducated people are. smell something, whatever smell dissolved air. People inhaling fart particles, breathing air fart particles dissolved air. Viruses dissolve, means virus particle huge comparison smell. Smelling smell nothing whether mask keep virus. takes two years long term health study. Haha oh, Pfizer located?  posted 3 Eastern US. 8 Eastern, 4.4k upvotes. I’d like offer another opinion within getting blindly downvoted. I’m medical professional, consider least somewhat informed vaccine approval process one approved quickly. 

I get flu shot every year, kids pets vaccinated, I’ve gotten vaccine boosters adult without hesitation. Yet still might wait get one. rushed, I’ve lost faith system. trust information put CDC point, Trump administration allowed control message throughout pandemic? feels politics allowed take precedence science, messages CDC swayed Trump’s whims...especially terms schools reopening. feel safe vaccine process wasn’t tainted way Trump flunkies?

I’m conspiracy theorist worship scientists true heroes experts pandemic. It’s things get really weird average citizen see executive branch ignoring mask rules freely spreading Covid, see president hold press conference suggests injecting people bleach-and Birx went along it!-and people seem controlling directing message CDC health agencies. Serum Institute Pune, India world's biggest vaccine maker, manufacturing 1 billion vaccine doses created Oxford. 

And send country world. Mrs key worker asked wanted receive vaccine Xmas. It’s hell yeah definitely will. Dec 10. week away provide approval goes well. Publix! still phase 3, there's results yet, asshole. like vaccines ready. Well big Red Wave Republicans we're bragging 2020. look ""restricted"" states Massachusetts, might well said ""we're accepting state people right now"" fact first mRNA vaccine? may faster make mRNA vaccine sure safety? Europe (particularly: Hungary) uncommon flu vaccine.

FAKE NEWS. Thats completly FALSE. reality 90% population( 10 11 million total) sort flu vaccine. almost everyone takes new one yearly (usually around october-november december) Meaning dont it.  I'm half Belgian (Mom's side) I'm following much interest. vaccines flown Brussels Chicago last week produced Puurs, Belgium one Pfizers largest production operations world. Belgium hit particularly hard virus, ranking #1 deaths per capita. Hope beginning end that. Thank conversion tip.

I insist however size foot superior standard measure foot. type activity matters, too. Concerts super-spready events. last things allowed. Fauci saying July 2021 *as best case scenario*. idea makes people think best case scenario happen. latest polls reveal slightly 50% people plan getting it. mean, hey, reducing total population infection vectors solid 45% great. ain't going enough squash summer. We're going get there, let's sell false hope, either.  First all, case taking action gyms lawsuit opened prematurely adhering health orders,the state's Powers remain unchanged since beginning year. Second , time ruling Ohio already reopening gyms businesses. Third all, ruling successfully appealed district Court couple months ago, deemed order's legal. I’m SW CO watching medical flights (flightradar24) ferrying people Abq Farmington northern CO Texas....all day everyday last week.

I’m terrified happens hospitals start fill up.

My local hospital full weeks flying people clear Denver. Even people recover, bills going outrageous. 1 death tragedy, 270k statistic Finally trump unites country something Population density impact spread COVID rural dense population areas followed policies practices.
I guarentee NYC people followed Dakotans practices state policies people's attitudes. NYC lot cases. hope get well soon. Since home extra time could consider going current expenses &amp; seeing might able save. Consider going insurance policies make sure everything date. Maybe discounts receiving. could also get quote room companies see save. cable call &amp; see ways lower bill, promotions etc. go you’re closet garage see items sell online better. know technically isn’t making money find 50-100 savings month adds up. Best luck. see american propaganda work comment section sheesh Oh look, google tells automobile deaths [occur age Same. People think logically.

I can't remember numbers I'm gonna make up. one point something like say 5% people died (even mostly high risk patients) say 30-40% required hospitalization. hospitals backed way could survive still require attention get help need?

Death rate go people can't get treated otherwise preventable death. So, usual timeline vaccine development 10 years, they’ve manages get dome 10 months. awe inspiring frightening time. Keeping fingers crossed. Intranasal vaccines used years least equines. IM strangles vaccine carry pretty severe side effects typically seen version also effective preventing outbreaks. Rare, 102 immune system probably reactive used be. either get antibody response cell response sufficient protect second infection. cannot first get it. Thousands people already taken vaccine trials analysed actual scientists UK several countries zero commercial interest distributing it.

If agree safe safe. Amateur scientists Reddit Facebook learn trust real scientists change. happens tell English can't go pub. feel like tagged news posts need follow rules many subs allow altered headlines. Either many people bad reading/writing comprehension, intentionally try gain traction sensationalizing headlines. started eating people immediately jumped ship started swimming. even wait half hour. size feet nothing it. 

To quickly roughly convert square feet square meters simply take 10% initial number remove 10% that. instance: 1500 square feet would around 135 square meters. (The actual number 139 square meters.) young, healthy, fit doctors, nurses, first responders died covid. Repeated exposure builds level virus system overwhelm body’s immune response.  Yay! amazing. It’s made day already EUA, full fledged approval? much vaccine available ready go? Oh no... get hands top secret map? one knew information before. clearly infected. Maybe infectious.

That may nuance need clarify. someone tests positive cycle threshold 40, reporting positive, practical ways, person actually infected viable virus. culture would yield reproducible virus thus absolutely infectious. person exposed larger inoculum later, would potential become ill. 

So question is, benefit reporting positives high cycle thresholds? gives us bigger numbers? question even mean? appears benefit looking positive PCRs actually mean someone may develop disease and/or infectious. person testing positive 40 ct intents purposes equivalent person tests negative. ways matter, person negative, even ""positive"" PCR. they've never published phase 3 trial data. sharing it, concrete evidence efficacy work telling absolutely incorrect one CDC would ever advise come work recent positive test unconfirmed symptoms. either straight lying grossly misunderstood something everyone work calling osha state health department. Like, right now. in, wake people tell call. Now.

I work health department. don’t know state you’re want pm maybe help find numbers. 

This super serious.

Nobody advising break isolation. Ever. test positive get minimum 10 day isolation. It’s longer depending course individual illness. 

Nobody advising break quarantine, in, you’ve exposed someone confirmed test for, unless it’s matter life limb, you’re essential medical/other worker that’s given specific permission. 

[Here’s quarantine recommendation, updated October Now, there’s talk **today** they’re going shorten ten days, maybe week. state decide proceed new information yet guideline officially announce it.  meaningless comparisons devolving speculation. disappears. disappears like nobody's seen before. Yes Canada same! Yes, understand that.

That's used *suspected* numbers rather using *confirmed* numbers.

It may appear rare due issues confirmation, also may appear rare actually is.

It could either.

To state definitely appears rare difficulty confirmation pretty big assumption part. Yes, got sick vaccinated, none developed serious symptoms required hospitalization. That's key takeaway here. (Citing Moderna's results) think MHRA playing politics Brexit? Based I'm counting newyears normalcy. Anything gravy.  ""short"" COVID compare to? electrolytes. friend mine severe case nausea vomiting pregnancy. Turns holding food drink vomiting uncontrollably fucks surprisingly short order. That's true vaccine though. Teens children rarely severe symptoms mortality. Like anything else go away greatly reduce infections deaths. Hell, never went bed! Look leaders are, could trust anything lmao part phase, order groups given vaccine announced Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI): 
residents care home older adults carers 
***everyone aged 80 over, frontline health social care workers*** 
everyone aged 75 
everyone aged 70 over, ***clinically extremely vulnerable*** 
everyone aged 65 
people aged 16 64 ***underlying health conditions put higher risk serious disease death Covid-19*** 
everyone aged 60 
everyone aged 55 
everyone aged 50 groups cover 90-99% risk dying Covid-19, according JCVI. DeSantis far trump's ass can't see what's going on.   r/nottheonion Naw. USA least, soon thing eradicated, we'll back miserable little lives slaves system dependent entirely employer healthcare. Yup. enough herd immune disease potential super spreading events like bars, nightclubs, gigs, theatre, cinema, cruises, sports games, name go ahead. They’ll probably refuse entry vaccine deniers pandemic starts easing liability insurers licensing authority insist it. eventually even unnecessary. reckon might actually inject 800k people next week. Boris says millions way 31st Dec! don’t really think needed “leaked” map anything continue push fear mongering article eh? mean, appreciate level savagery. kind wake call people need. Yes, symptoms considerably severe well fewer cases asymptomatic carriers wish British now. red bull, full English paracetamol enough you? lots, yes. 80+ million people voted leader idiot brigade likely anti-mask/Covid deniers least LOT average American thinks. Government asked us take personal responsibility clear recommendations, did. 100% course, still quite ok. Look graphs excess death probably numbers compare... Shame. would give tons worthless internet points. prevention paradox? countries succesful managing first wave that, probably, people discounted actual danger secod wave. Imagine thinking BBC American news lot stupid deniers, look Trump, throws COVID rallies place, even one trusted advisors die COVID, even caught himself....and still takes precautions still throwing COVID rallies. See Dominic Cummings impact UK COVID. isn’t individuals impacts wider community. Realistically probably death numbers aren’t accurately reported  much hand? Yeah, sub good beginning, important news stuff. comes US politics destroying everything burying important news articles Covid them. Dr DoNothing pEoPlE tAkInG PaNdEmIc SeRiOuSlY?!? don’t mind people wrong, drives mad they’re smug disrespectful wrongness. another two vaccines coming. couple months healthcare workers elder people safe, relief hospitals. Thing getting better. system victimises them.

Shameful! name every one stupid governors thanks anti-USA circlejerk sub. Yeah that's works neither tools motivation. people around care anymore. feel like herd immunity going end summer regardless vaccine not. greek politician said today vaccination start days new year's eve reality show host charge. heard uyghur muslim ~~concentration~~ summer camps? seem fun full arts crafts! Huh, wonder going feel like people UK. Months lockdown fear going go away everyone vaccine. Huh. Truly strange. predictions ""if"" decided ignore.
""If 70% popupation"" stated comment certain, neithet him, studies one since like 50%... 
Ymi dismissing claims, conditional predictions based statements proofs
Stop listening professionals, try think truly analyse saying... end middle wife child left house almost entire year now. several masks rotation sanitizer everywhere. family outings blown three vacations far. Thanksgiving us Christmas same. daughter's birthday thinking renting movie theater probably stay home. One like others. 

The President warning everyone take precautions calling mask mandates restrictions, have. know everyone wants vaccine accepted ASAP, critical steps must followed carefully. Anyway, supply short next 6-8 weeks, really matter much whether vaccine approved today three weeks. enjoy feeling relief! already 50K upvotes.. see Americans sleeping now, sub cares upvote US news. Within weeks, kidding me? WEEKS? It’s approved Europe today. pull heads asses get top this? This! Sweden lot US states right now. that's already meme definitely make isnt even natural 100 year pandemic. LOL. Rochester! is, quite literally, biggest news.  Honestly - severe infection January due bushfires. miserable.

But lungs get better time. beginning end. Hopefully current wave UK last surge. Everyone's migraines different. Mine rarely lasted longer day severity - two three days afterwards still residual headache felt like shit. rarelg get them, keeping allergies control seems helped, although might accidental corellation. Seems could lead example. 

Seems people waiting politicians others tell ""NPCs"" use insult. Yea, thought would blow up. makes feel like even big news. sub turned stats show off? one them. I'm happy 😭😭😭 Guess atheist nurse I’m screwed 😂 idiots Australia, protests like 2 days something lockdown going end.

We dont support (in general) though sometimes get elected reason Callus unfortunately 

Old dead inside see trail data website think looking for. I’m sorry It’s time break fucking rule! vaccinated people spread virus? think talking US. Let's see, passed 12 month anniversary first recorded symptom onset COVID Wuhan.

I know recorded reinfection cases initially contracted COVID, let's call March so.

That's around 9 months ago.

I'm expert, believe 9 months constitutes *""pretty long time""* terms immunity.

That's thing novel viruses - know long-term looks like actually get long-term. goes immunity, long-term health effects, etc.

**NOTE:** realize post comes condescending. I'm trying dick. late energy rewrite it. think idea quarantining states rejected back March came White House. 

Of course months later governors tried enforce similar restrictions own. would perfect time invade US....jus' sayin

Shit. live house apartment - shared ventillation even bathroom pipes culprit. Coronavirus found empty apartments studies. :/ we're trying achieve highest number can. insane. Fauci make conservative predictions. vaccines came data hoping candidate would approved least 70% efficacy, saying early 2022 normalcy. even that, said would probably 12-18 months vaccine available. He’s making reasonable estimations adjusting situation changes. fact think he, experienced public health expert, isn’t considering variables vaccine production, distribution, administering making predictions, ludacris. Again, I’ll keep listening experts instead Reddit scientists.   Swedish healthcare system decentralized, hospitals like run state rather Sweden's 21 regions.

The response therefore completely throughout Sweden, still national strategy. pandemic, line regions' responsibilities state's responsibilities bit fuzzy easily confusing (and actually one main reasons took long time ramp testing). Could help tell Trump believes vaccines promoting since May? feel :) GenX person grew without lead paint gasoline account people age younger support Trump? Proud Boys Boomers. lead generation from. social media propaganda. need lived diet paint chips susceptible. Australia didnt culture wearing facemasks....very rarely would see someone Melbourne's CBD one pre-covid.

Part populace willing listen government, part backing enforcement/communication part listening science evidenced based measures.

Also, supporting people trouble, though could better, bad. cannot think way. Remember, November last year, No-one even knew Covid-19 existed. 
I would say current speed vaccine related news gone fast possible Fuck that. doctor give prescription mine. would anyone wait back line? goes Favipiravir. Everyone given script asks. would logical responsible leaders cancel flights week Thanksgiving.  Biden really fuckin new president I’m taking care two elderly parents resumed going stores months ago. wear two masks: disposable one cotton one filter it. It’s so-able you’re careful, knock wood. Yo fellow melbournian!

as &amp; thesillyoldgoat said, part multi pronged strategy.

Masks alone help slow spread, dont stop it. Fucking paywall! ah u might close person ask , 200k cases day , vaccinination program even come close that..otherwise wont pandemic outrun vacc program ? I’m cancer patient I’ve outright people tell oh well, 1% die, it. “If I’m scared, stay home.”

I don’t leave house anything else. go chemo, husband nurse. blow stupid town?  Oh no, r/unexpectedfactorial China bias, American source trust.  wonder way obtain samples back find lethal now? Poland people still understand serious - 8500 people die first week November usual (which around 7000 per week). Hospitals barely coping still extremely strained (it calmed tiny bit still far over). kills me, article dated Nov. 30th states phizer Moderna submitted fir FDA approval... yet TODAY UK approved vaccine starting distribution. fuck isn’t approved United States distributed TODAY. literally saying need wait 14th. I’m government! sane people *don't already know*? Australia here.

We made states. sayin' share idea, least 70% take vaccine
He also overly optimistic considering much damage anti vaccine groups caused difficulties production keeping breath, likely degree normality start end 2021 friend lived youth. described “the buckle Bible Belt”. ""I am. . . inevitable""

""And I. . . am. . . Pfizer Man"" Yeah......no..... concert industry absolutely back summer.

I actually hard! still month Georgia's Senate elections. Yes, already late  Looks like US one virus Fuck that. doctor give prescription mine. would anyone wait back line? goes Favipiravir. Everyone given script asks. didn’t need leak know tho... read article.

""we basically still think right strategy Sweden""

Is one quotes literally article.


For future, you(as you, 'Muricans) focus country instead speaking country know nothing about. news garbage incredibly biased literally every subject.

kthxbye. I'm sorry friend friend died, horrible loss suffered. remember promised millions dead Americans now, yet small bump yearly death numbers. I'm willing sacrifice people mental health, find funny think dying thought, polls show Americans getting sick lockdowns science back.

My chances dying .00003%, lasting effects 1/11. I'm young, seem old one dying peers, toxic culture dividing America. Try break bones like brittle biden, sweetheart. MAGAkota Oh course, herd immunity going help lot People lazy. won’t even take ten minutes read science behind vaccine. thing save life can’t spend ten minutes it. spend 5 hours FB looking Hillary Clinton memes side benefits rich always gonna propaganda. rich money spare. Lol... I’ve teaching small classroom 30 kids since early August. 90% teachers state Texas... teaching online students person kids, time, exact amount pay, amount prep time, busted equipment pandemic.

So ya... incorrect mom, tend meet lot parents. Sometimes gradually sometimes immediately(!), often let views vaccination slip. Thankfully, I’m pretty sure antivaxxers vaccine hesitant people minority. wield lot power fuck herd immunity seed outbreaks.

I’ve met fair amount antivaxxers. religious zealots. crunchy liberals. insanely conspiracies. read stupid Dr. Sears book. like love people know don’t agree vaccines, lot ones I’ve met dumb and/or rude. much experience people, might want “complain” too. (I could tell many stories...)

And IMO, it’s fantastic there’s people complaining antivaxxers antivaxxers, means we’re likely achieve good level hard immunity. Here’s hoping. made laugh Nope! Okc city wide mandate places nothing statewide. cloth ones normally getting nose piece wire bent correctly works well enough me. 

I find easier surgical ones though. glasses start fogging put half twist ear loops. Stops much air venting upwards. understand saying disagree. think reasonable treat flu differently COVID-19 they're vastly different diseases. It’s anytown USA. free testing sites requires symptoms close contact. Wait time 4+ hours. would thought message brought Mike Pompeo. Nah man miss concerts Yeah Doctor sucked since Matt Smith left. Well know right mind but, Masks, social distancing, suspending group functions, limiting restaurants take-out, etc., etc., etc.

Or, look forward losing lot residents COVID-19 coming months. can't people think serious least understand aspect ?

Because want to. logic they're operating from. Nothing change minds. 

if real would greatly inconvenience them. 

They want inconvenienced

Therefore real. Vitamin deficient maybe Tuesday news conference:   WHA reported 170 ICU beds open among state’s 134 hospitals, indicating 88.4% state’s ICU beds occupied  day HHS Protect reports 66% Wisconsin, State Wisconsin reports 88%. OK mask mandate? [Makes wonder why](http://imgur.com/a/Z7Vfb1E)  retroactive till dec 1st doesn’t help thousands/millions people months behind rent help catch job searching. Congress could agree provide $300/week, make retroactive September 1st, economy much stronger chance bouncing back soundly Look shape one tell wasn’t manufacturer’s intent. Yup. zero-cost way raise taxes give equivalent cut vaccinated. people died shortly admission longer around vaccinated.

The stat really need average remaining lifespan current nursing home resident, newly admitted one. Unfortunately impossible tell link, unless unnaturally good eyeballing calculations histograms.

At one theoretical extreme, everyone dies exactly 14 months admission mean remaining lifespan current resident 7 months. gives lower bound life expectancy. Toward extreme, suppose (very theoretically) 99 100 people admitted die immediately, 100th person admitted lives 117 years nursing home--so mean remaining lifespan almost 60 years. nurses doctors know actually ""hunkering down"". 

Politicians morons hypocrites. ""I say it, demanded it"" Welp.. sucks suck. there's chance value changed 22% one week.

Given data, I'd say excellent chance. People think need hospital need kind care often ever before. They're willing ""chance it"" since *normally* heart attack get car accident... fine guess... /s won’t issue statewide mask mandate he’ll declare day prayer, sending 270,000 dead americans bad? Adding ~1200 per day too.

Traffic laws needed find dozen politicians break them?  gonna pay it? Remind Spanish person horrendous youth unemployment Spain (even virus). US single digits. see bunch local ""friends"" already voting comment, even though right money. What’s GA map? someone explain? think Cuomo great job. Yes NY highest recorded deaths, need consider context knew 0 virus, treatments approved, Federal Government keeping stockpile unused. exercised executive power lock state timely manner able turn around relatively quick amoung time absolutely one best investments government make. Picture related cant unsee now, lifetime wont forget selfish stupid good majority people america start bringing comment post history argument already lost work state capital city hospital hit hardest March, map saw us currently Red. 10% covid patients then. hospital ran 180% ICU capacity, yet ER visits 70%. converted outpatient beds ICU beds, nurses staffed areas became ICU nurses buddies. Since shut non emergent procedures, even 180% beds staff available recruit. tent cities ready, utilized. Guess event organizers neglected enforce recommended “glory hole guidelines.” Guess BC CDC better idea. That's cognitive dissonance. Thats simple delusion. Smoking believe get sick accepting isnt dissonance. I'm supposed quarantined end tomorrow high risk mother heard news, immediately barged room said I'm free..

I'm sure feel this. leak, turns ""real information"" ""fake news information."" Except leak ""fake news."" know goes. Thanks NObama! flu shot mandatory hospital work continue work without it. third hospital I've worked make flu vaccine mandatory continue allow staff work without it, although one hospital require staff refused vaccine wear mask throughout entire flu season. Personally think mandatory schedule, also feel way new COVID vaccine. work public health, need date important vaccinations. chose science based profession, therefor support vaccinations backed science experts. According link relied avoiding closed spaces, crowded spaces close contact settings, also put aggressive contact tracing isolation system place supported extensive public health network, think accurate say Japan relied masks alone.
Taiwan institute lockdown either far 7 Covid deaths total, response also comprehensive included widespread mask wearing, fact masks still mandatory even recent infections, Vietnam also general lockdown. 
I'm saying can't done without lockdowns, action needs decisive early, virus becomes widely distributed way pull back lockdowns, vaccine course. AOC categories eh? 👀 government turned doctor recommended herd immunity

2 falsehoods one sentence like Angela, Pamela, Sandra Rona

And continue know getting sweeter

So do? really beg you, Lord

To flirting like sport, anything fly

It's good, let dump it, please set trumpet saying open like nothing going on. ask recent negative Covid test rapid testing airport (like Iceland). really understand I'm saying, you? PEOPLE DIE FLU. 650,000 people year. lot Fucking people whose well-being infringed ""freedumbs."" might say that's fair compromise go maskless, million many. That's fine. know draw line. guess really saying ok certain number deaths freedumbs. guess agree that. exclusions Pfizer study. also included anyone 85+. Unfortunately without testing groups receive vaccine work done. excluded pretty well vulnerable people COVID.

5% seroprevalence actually target would expect given diagnoses, assuming caught hospital-worthy cases deaths, caught fraction non-hospital-worthy cases. 4.5k recorded deaths would indicate 500,000 cases, that's close enough 5% city 11 million. Yeah right! Doesn’t sound nuts all. I’ve got history TB I’m higher risk catching Covid get TB come dormancy. makes feel little better mom diabetic...at time already it, 90 degrees outside cleaning garage, 5 hours working goes hm im little tired. pretty much sums whole covid experience! lost sense smell rest okay. know everybody’s different hopefully gives little piece mind! I'm guessing first world country. literally hundreds millions people using Facebook can't afford call across world. take kind stuff granted never issue entire life. Motivation come surprising sources fucked system inundated stupid people alter perspective rapidly. start swimming, started eating people. he's fake youtube doctor. screw him. Oximeters save lives. People put much trust Covid tests. Often negative tests accurate; Asian countries multiple tests days apart make sure. Vomiting/diarrhea probably reasons death. understanding deaths like usually due critically low oxygen level. premed/EMT. Maybe doctor correct me.

We prevent kind tragedies happening ***at home***. Yeah, that’s really big problem healthcare system. It’s designed profitable, even normal conditions beds 70% capacity. there’s small emergency like major traffic pileup something it’s problem. there’s major emergency like big industrial accident natural disaster take critical patients capacity reached send rest nearby hospitals. pandemic though *everywhere* runs capacity problems there’s simply good options. People put substandard temporary facilities don’t get much attention staff spread thin. That’s important try keep ever getting point. virus test antibody test? really want get antibody test see I've infected previously.

Anyone insights done achieve this? I’ve literally seen Facebook posts people calling masks church “demonic” saying won’t going church demon mask wearers. People absolutely bonkers, it’s mind blowing. Ok reporting single digit deaths days reporting 4000+ new cases day? Ever since 25th Nov, deaths plummeted stayed way reporting thousands new cases, check it.

They either hiding deaths help going unmentioned No. monkey studies looked this. sad. BTW link died reddit load feel story must told.

“But evidence show virus fueled pandemic mutated version SARS-CoV-2 originates China. D614G mutation hit Europe US much harder Wuhan outbreak, prompting speculation China honest severity Wuhan spread.”

The leaked Wuhan Files proved many us saying since beginning/mid January leaked videos Wuhan doctors (and citizen journalists) began quietly spread online.

They lied everything. daily case numbers fake, proven Twitter user showed daily numbers would days/weeks advance. right. figured formula.

Fast forward now. USA. Gov lying downplaying everything since beginning wouldn’t “scare” public.

Even now, literally now, states hiding information, truthful numbers, ignoring recommendations. (I’m looking you, Texas news broke today Gov Abbot doing.)

Edit: words added clarification. Pandemics typically last 24 months vaccines works, lot things go wrong meantime. ruling Judge Eugene Lucci Lake County Court Common Pleas explains private property rights fundamental rights Ohio, Ohio Department Health violated rights exceeded authority “criminalizing lawful businesses, imposing strict liability violations, including severe criminal, civil, equitable penalties”: “The director statutory authority close businesses, including plaintiffs’ gyms . . . acted impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, oppressive manner without procedural safeguards.”

The ruling excoriates department health’s insistence “one unelected individual could exercise unfettered power force everyone obey impermissibly vague rules without legislative guidance.”

“Constitutions written prevent governments arbitrarily interfering citizens’ lives businesses. front, call action clear: governor health director may longer impose closures regulations write criminal penalties enforce regulations closures,” said 1851 Center Executive Director Maurice Thompson. “We remain available serve caught State’s tangled web unlawful orders.” Evolution favor society, unfortunately.

The ones breed winners, overcrowded mega-civilization, tends less educated least concerned others. goes hyper religious ironically name ""pro life"" group. Unwanted children tend harsher upbringings, less education, unwanted children - makes evolutionary winners terrible civilization large.

To truly win game species playing would break new ground go natural inclinations - ""birth control bad"", ""as long immediate circle needs one else matters"", etc.

I'm feeling optimistic. 2021 Oscars scheduled held April 25, 2021 vaccines available general public then.

Prolly gonna blame ""millenials"". pretty inspirational bro Lol... businessmen business. family member possibly looking long term medication oxygen deal effects Covid. Let’s talk mental illness let tell you, chronic conditions take toll. literally sit home room 2 weeks goes away. fine :) never disappear though. around form another eliminate coronavirus altogether. eye contains mucus membrane, kind good point. Yeah, it’s ultimately state distribute it. mention third party group making recommendation CDC, director decide wants make official  explains it’s hard find testing. people live “regular” areas it’s stupid simple get test. footage bs though? people collapsing street etc. Cuz never happened here. So, acceptance criteria vaccine reduce infectivity rates, reduce disease, reduce death.

We actually data right two vaccines reducing infectivity. since one death, real data demonstrating reduced mortality. *possible* two vaccines things, actually data it.

But **do** data reduces serious disease. means efficient use scarce resource give people likely help.

There like 150 vaccines development, look reducing infectivity. nasal spray one seems particularly promising. one vaccines come along first, I'd favor giving vaccine spreaders, that's science brought us right now.

&amp;nbsp;

One consideration: actually going comparatively quick easy vaccinate nursing home residents. already nurses place monitor, assess treat side effects come up. residents live building (at least days) rarely leave. Administration already naking arrangements whatever informed consent papers needed.

You easily vaccinate entire nursing home day, vast majority follow-up shots easy. going anywhere *near* easy essential workers like grocery store clerks.

As small side bonus, first distributions areas high concentration allows initial logistical issues worked vaccine makes way broader community. Tyere still logistics problems, sure, they'll able eork least ahead time. still think Smurf gathering 3500 people happened first began reported news wonder many Smurf LARPers passed virus around. never saw follow up. Disgusting hate them. Science landed vaccine doses sky Belgium? 


Quick everyone pray away Covid-19 give sky daddy credit. Thank you. We're trying. I’ve two tests last month, quick ones. Literally pulled side hospital, swabbed nostrils, gave Rice Krispie treat. Phoenix. Dude whoa I've experience Alabama, think that's reality people true. Health care workers essential get infected jobs. know people got infected eating indoors restaurant even though fully complied limitations crowd size. 

People nursing homes get infected staff members. 

There many asymptomatic presymptomatic carriers spread illness without knowing. 

There many common examples infections people “flagrantly” avoiding rules. map looks surprisingly... bipartisan  Bro idiots saying it’s overblown speak. ""Reveals."" already know? way thread get extremely weird. want know how, without serious government/military coordination vaccinate tens millions people month. 

You ever go CVS get flu shot? It’s quick process. 

I noticed Germany building mass-vaccination facilities. really hope Biden admin plan like running ASAP. That’s kinda point. sooner teachers get back classroom better. mention fact lot places that’s right Trump left US like would leave shell companies contractors... broke dying. thread joking something? think herd immunity works exactly?

70% demographic getting vaccinated give herd immunity, demographics get it, populations do.

The 30% old people vaccinated still interact non-vaccinated younger population, herd immunity. Within Villages Florida virtually elderly-only locations, would extent, anywhere else.

Vaccinating 70% people 50 give demographic herd immunity vaccinating 70% left handed people would group.

It's video game bonus, chocking virus mass immunity, segregated demographic, unless demographics segregated other. Don’t need map tell this.  Gees, wins parties could point to. ideal bill. ideally want state aid give corporations covid-get-out-of-free card. thought better nothing. Depressing surprised. Thank getting vaccine. think US center universe. confirmed yet though. known Nah. Trump would take sharpie correct it. would incredibly interesting know effect stuff like continues us. believe right probably living significant effects whether know not.

I would add though lots people 'smart', would score highly intelligence tests advanced degrees, still cruel selfish, garbage values. ""Screw you, look mine only"" really widespread attitude. Covid kills people? Oh well, want continue whatever want. must missed something, besides reports. allowed? really disgusts many people can't see difference ""Your kid must vaccinated attend schools"" ""You must vaccinated engage private businesses."" different precedent set that's literally giving government ability deny right participate society. add anecdotal diversity, one time Eleven Madison Park definitely one amazing meals I've ever had. far amazing meal (and one amazing experiences) I've ever Epicure 3 Michelin star restaurant Paris. Ah yes container ship confederate flags sunk. still, calculations much leeway seems like situations safe (which believe yet). something like spend 8 hours 10 people room catch it? people tend say ""well kills people comorbidities going die anyway."" guess can't get hospital heart attack whatever they'll say thing. ""Well people going die *anyway* died get hospital right away."" Something Dawn really works like Plain Dawn like Dawn Advanced tried didn’t work natural disaster we've ever US modern times complete fuckup. 

If worse US would civil war right now... relatedly, biomedical science research! Americans - flyover country gets disproportionate vote. think kids also used told follow rules. Sexual partners essential travel still allowed. visas/work permits considered essential.  could always move Man shows whole set chess pieces crammed ass. Back line, sir. end see state lockdowns hospitals can't keep hospitals staffed. don’t know meme. Sorry. would take longer? canada purchased vaccines already. America isn’t sending Canada best people. could worse nothing? sure area live testing back bad levels back spring. father law close contact get Covid get test. couldn’t get testing appointment 4 days anywhere county. I’m hearing thing county neighboring states. wife dreams $1000 bail lmao serious. reason punishment. arguing that, saying profiting bullshit  reasons death wish psycho. Perhaps one same.  doctor asked wanted blood test. actually help? I’ll definitely need vaccination. restrictions, masks, full capacity, paying fines importantly, he's benefitting paying rent NYS ban residential commercial evictions. still, 100 million infected, rate spread must decrease. people randomly spread probably people take best precautions. Like people decided going travel Thanksgiving. No? Actually paying anything theirs. collect government assistance. 

Unlike prisons pay everything do. water use flush shit TV watch. 

And argument you. Lmfao make statement done.

And yes care LAW ADBIDING CITIZENS. psuh prisons getting child rapist vaccine people even killed fly. okay that's telling value.  say they, im talking people take seriously. 
 
We need hold people responsible. It’s Biontech’s fault shitty country doesn’t want pay vaccine you. Copy paste It’s virus could stay home for. don’t speed either. it’s honestly moot. haven’t speeding ticket 43 years life. you’re supposed don’t problems. make dumb shit choices win dumb shit prizes. hero, thank team hard work. Children dying Covid know long term effects them.

I'm tired hearing kids safe, absolutely not.  know gotten nutty WH telling public health officials circumvent state's government leaders.

lovely innit. many us doing, yet still manage get work taking kids school, kids school events like parents posted thread. Unless collectively agree stop going work. certain needs must met many us able shelter completely. Sure agree disagree. say even 10x estimate still 99.9% late spring imo like Bay Area weeks ago. still get tested it’s booked week out. someone makes living Street fairs, appreciate you!   Destroying people lives ”-30% 'cases' "" - funny lockdownists even able happy numbers... asked - police answer: ""beat black peopl...wait...are recording??""

I *sorta* kid. Let's work together reduce unneeded violence. watch distillery stuff. gets recalled time. get real time recall information FDA job distillery hand sanitizers constantly usually either methanol contamination high enough ABV. Also stinks like cheap sugar shine dries skin out.

You make super easy though get 90% isopropyl alcohol Everclear though, really easy. math applied alcohol, humectant polymer gel up. Essential oil give little smell-good. use lanolin propylene glycol humectants, J-Lube make gel little peppermint lavender oil make smell nice. Protip: much googling J-Lube stick veterinary supply websites. powdered OB lube livestock vets use field also super popular kink scene. want finished sanitizer 70% alcohol. realist thinks can't even persuade people wear mask, going get take novel vaccine virus think big deal hoax?

By mandating it? like done before. We've even taken people sent go die jungle before.

Don't want take vaccine? problem, school, work, travel, college, etc you.

This pandemic directly harms interstate commerce security nation. 100% bullet proof constitutional federal government take extreme actions fighting it. federal government designed do: collectivize power order address threats individual state address alone.

Americans thoroughly brainwashed propaganda demoralized disgustingly pervasive corruption incompetence government. Stop demanding destroy government start demanding competence government. Yes, competent government thing, like anything else life (cars, houses, kids) requires individual INVEST time energy maintaining it. work maintain good government. average American spoiled lazy slob even know name congressman, wonders congressman corrupt sellout piece sh-t.

We imagined could land man moon fucking it. 50 years later, nations could did. Somewhere along way, started believing can't big things more. started believing way things can't changed. That's gotta stop spoiled entitled idiots country need get straightened out. 

With said, cannot good faith blame wanting take rushed vaccine. simply way fully know long term effects vaccine is. I'm anti-vaxxer doctor medical professional tell bad vaccines long history causing significant harm people. even factor greedy/corrupt behavior big pharma knowingly sold expired/bad vaccines poorer nations. Powys, Wales, 296 pubs/bars/clubs population 132K people.

Cardiff 200 330K population. 

I think he'll fine. get one simple caveat difficult spreading false equivalence around understand... defending them, wonder side story was. test positive, actually live Hawaii? Perhaps running money stay hotel two weeks? ask assistance kind situation?

If there's one thing gov't done good job telling people providing real support help behave said manner. fact, lot politicians suddenly getting caught breaking rules.

Atrocious behavior, motive completely missing story. booing save us sure feel great i'm able empathize nostalgic desire social gathering, knowing families couples busy reproducing first global quarantine.. worse, open again, people mega enjoy wild unabashed fun, contributing next population BOOM R isn’t good metric tracking covid spread. assumes linear spread evenly done infected people.

Covid spreads stochastically, high dispersion, K. means people get it, roughly 80% spread one, 20% spread high rate, sometimes many 30-50 people.

This effect making seem like random hot spots pop up. complicates herd immunity people sick super spreaders still likely infect decent number non immune people. vaccine one best hopes. see get next pandemic gonna wish got $19 beer agree three weeks big deal. agree fact EU acting like standards exacting MHRA rigorous, reality simply appears they're slower could be. Ascribing difference approval time rigour likely bureaucracy complacency reach opinion. ready book cruise vacation 2022? fucking mess. Trump admin trying strike protection pre-existing conditions (as republicans torpedo insurance markets). late 80s, baby can’t donate blood US  deniers/anti maskers say wear pneumonia covid. ridiculous. guys assume every TV shows universe also covid? link full blue works fine fyi 6 days average time infection symptom onset according CDC. Wow exact here! destination wedding Mexico hopefully travel restrictions relieved take chances covid take chances vaccine? Shoot plz. sounds like “friends” idiots. 

I’ve gotten Covid test wife too. $0 mean $0 entire visit. 

Stop spreading misinformation maybe help friends navigate healthcare system you’re know all. Except can't spread medical error grandma grandkids holidays..

People realize medical error huge issue kills tens thousands, virulent highly infectious viral pathogen. 

You're comparing apples carrots there...

 yeah, they're delicious come plants, one fruit one vegetable. wife given blood years year said veins small.. case, suffer rest natural life. course mentions natural immunity increasing percentage population... spending $12 giant ass bag kettle corn almost tall me. 

I actually learned make kettle corn home pandemic. good same. Also fully realize much popcorn get buy stand. answer metric ass ton. Kind sounds like Ebola tbh, permanent hearing loss die think saw article said we'd 10 million March following 30 million year. noticed meter ( FDA approved ) get wacky reading high low, take redo again. fingers thick skin due usage. logging readings year now, look pattern change see take action. Take temperature? Sometimes also let readings settle minute. It’s good cheap tool times though. don’t respiratory issues unless 60 years old part it. stories piling up.

I see responses along lines ""just they're hypocrites mean they're wrong"", think better question wonder perhaps actually believe restrictions called necessary. That's crazy!!! guess severity 8 hour wait warranted overhanging fear may sick. Keep well. I'm curious take speeding analogy presented u/bfwolf1 thing guaranteed death taxes personally went Big Bend Marfa week Thanksgiving. fair, think travel responsibly want to. think whether travel stay home, wear masks go avoid indoor gatherings. hiking, covered mouth nose passing hikers. camped friends nights barely met anyone else. tourists bad us need nature stay sane.

Also someone said back, ""try wearing mask blowing candle"" 5 paragraph article talks reinfection offer evidence it.

Well Done Jpost Texas last week weren’t lockdown measures. People seemed wearing masks such, restaurants bars still open people out-and-about like normal. Hawaii find positive? police reluctant crack vermin wear mask?

Glad jackass got ticket though - hopefully, many, many more.   Wait it, anti vaxers way. I've actually started dreams I'm wearing mask talking random dream people subsequently panic within dream. dream anxiety popped 3 months pandemic started. intense sometimes I'll wake still feel like I've exposed irresponsibly about. weird phenomenon I'm sure poignant reflection real-world anxieties. makes fucking sad. Im one biggest introverts miss around people deeply.

I can't watch party comedies makes miss much. Thanks! don’t think I’ve heard effective antibody treatments covid, makes wonder international travel - example - form “vaccination passport” put place.

Just reading bit antibody treatment called Bamlanivimab, given emergency use authorisation America last month. perhaps there’s hope yet immunosuppressed individuals. Same! vaccine news past days really lifted spirits. psh u already know. meanwhile people actually contribute society via meaningful low wage jobs (janitors, ems etc) wont get months. fuck celebrities. hell actually us need vaccine soon? like tests. Seconding greenblue98 said: it’s shithole here! wee babe arms lived UK, appears going disqualify forever =/ walk around mask alone pull see people nearby. stupid wear alone outside. Yep, exactly. past week, NFL done fairly decent job avoiding nassive breakouts. Theyve cases spread throughout team. Plus players given option opt season. 
This also give players vaccine ""trial"" spent $50 beer. Deal Devil. Worth it.  cases severe, imagine majority people view point enforced. I’m going wearing mask airports on, Hopefully people same. afraid, come contact anyone...... said ridiculous shutting down. Nobody coming help, government isnt paying anyone sit home, prioritizing geriatrics young people physical, sexual, income-generating prime? people working ones pay old folks sit around day play mahjong. Jeez that’s crazy! Mine encouraged call work I’m able to. acknowledged calling headache whatever honest it’s normal style desperate times call desperate measures. I’m sorry therapist didn’t validate (rational) fears. That's insane, yet people still denial virulent contagious Covid-19 is. get it. again: get flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, qanoners. Perhaps need get children access electron microscopes actually 'see' viruses instead thinking something 'feelings' reality. equal will. Funny say that,‘I massive comment string said one tested it, exactly zero idea vaccines stop pandemic. Apparently logic 

IF: B B+D = Q, predict Q likely C

Isn’t science, I’m tea reading.

On note go check fridge snakes, haven’t proven fridge doesn’t snakes.

Most days anymore wonder I’ve lost grip reality, since much thought understood basic logic science math aparently made up

I guess we’ll get vaccinated, eventually get covid anyway get crippled asymptomatic lung scarring Vaccine may immune virus, could still lesser symptoms spread it. far collective immunity know long vaccine efficient. already vases people covid, antibodies caught second time months later Neither even mentioned vaccine comments. WTF 1918 didn’t even know viruses thing Sounds good me, bring needle people! concept proof proof. thin justification belief. Well leukemia I'm immunocompromised fear thing self preservation, people gross fuck move line get it. ok me.  still go outside lockdown. we’re also populated state, still better case positivity rate hospitalization stats smaller states country. least governor kinda, know, cares citizens isn’t taking action. keep hitting low hospitalization bed case records though. sucks. Nothing embarrassing governor doesn’t care. WOOHOO TENNESSEE! Doesn’t make better 2 sick parents.. 4 y/o.. going *home*?

I get risk.. get ""ignore orders"" 41, Peterson, 46, ***who residents Wailua,*** arrested second-degree reckless endangerment charges. family member took child home Child Protective Services notified, Zickos said.

&amp;#x200B;

that said.. WTF Mainland first place?

that's *real* reason parents pokey kid CPS.

&amp;#x200B;

they mess around there. hear you. silver linings far one. H0SpitAl EmPTy DrOvE By! Fines (heavy) usually better deterrent... Vacation decompressing. 

I've cancelled Aruba Hawaii (and Sedona Pittsburgh Milwaukee and...) since March instead spent one week cabin woods one week 96% empty resort without leaving two properties.

I'm saying much escape could pre-Covid, definitely mentally beneficial safely get away everything bit. Someone needs make meme. serious? 

Before international health organizations outside Red Cross/Crescent. happen next week it? Wish he’d hurry told beginning washing hands 20 seconds plain soap would control virus. Alcohol based sanitizers used quickly kill germs viruses. Covid variation Corona virus, proven controlled alcohol based sanitizers 60% higher hand washing possible. Think I'll stick alcohol based sanitizers. never thought I’d miss overpriced hot dogs, yet chance hell. One things Boris right buy metric fuck load vaccines everyone, basically went full Donald shit, sitting orders vaccinate every citizen U.K. plus Ireland - orders 100 million Oxford/ Astra Zenica vaccine alone (should cover 50 69 million citizens).   It’s job see cracks system. We’re enraged didn’t sound long, strong alarm early on. you’re upset do. I’m aware DeSantis said that. wasn’t original comment, don’t present way. 

Your original comment (before edited it) *stadiums Florida packed right now*. 

As know (given edited comment)...not single stadium Florida full, let alone 25% capacity. dreams I'm naked work always feeling like ""Oh, awkward? I've while, realize guys problem it, guess I'll go find pants"" mounts anxiety can't find clothes put in. dreams mask work, second realize I'm maskless I'm absolutely mortified want fall pit die. 

Fun flip side I've gotten used wearing mask sometimes get home store, take off, can't remember wore store not. live area people quickly confront mask store least know wore always stressful question remembered unless TSA precheck Yeah, fit political narrative. dont fail comprehend anything. know people wrongly put prison. talking less 10% lol

And bruh im exaggerating shit. there. feelijg guilty every damn person prison wrongly. 


You correct jail mean law abiding. also go prison low amounts rec drugs dwis. There's reason walking streets. Also im pretty sure teenage girls got pregnant man wete put jail parents pursued it. No. It’s common misconception. Generally vaccines lower effectiveness time different age groups. got MMR vaccine years ago may 60% immunity measles, totally get measles. everyone vaccinated it’s hard spread. It’s true vaccine. Covid vaccine touted effective period time you’ll susceptible unless everyone gets vaccinated. 

Let’s put another way. Let’s say vaccine 85% effective. someone encounter it, 15% chance getting you’re vaccinated 100% aren’t. person also vaccinated exposed infected person, 15% chance getting 15% that. it’s like 2%. 3 people it’s like .3%. really helps.

Older people people weakened immune systems need people around vaccinated can’t get vaccinated. might 50 100% susceptible. upfront suck Trump admins teat early days, Redfield. Im sure too. fiancé (who allowed sit recovery masked) commented posed risk healthcare workers vice versa. feel awful right now. logic testing pointless. probably reduce spread campus significantly want see family again, go trips abroad. developed „Pfizer“-Vaccine! Meanwhile: plasma centers booming pay donors everyone broke work.  wasted time you. delete? hope good heaters them. Alberta place performing outdoor medicine December January. Hey remember totally kissed ass China actually praised handling COVID spring? live least cops basically ones following mask laws. know nobody call it. Non-redditors hard time understanding logic. talking scientific aspects herd immunity equal actually wanting pursue it? Especially mostly gets questions it, answers?  blood bank offering donors...a knit hat company logo. Oh, bonus, employees using cloth masks donation. Sounds swell. 

(I wear cloth masks think blood donation would considered medical procedure parties involved company-issued surgical masks!) How? UK still bound EU rules. UK legislation emergency approval. used EU legislation allows countries grant emergency approval. way resilient think, quarantine months right month. matter think never going happen, countries successfully done proved theory wrong. also matter ""are meant live"" face public health crisis. Even lower primates mammals general isolate/quarantine sick... inherent life this. So, hard disagree everything. really. 10,000th ticket, 1st.   make uneasy... makes excited able again.

I want vaccine ASAP bars, restaurants, church, casinos, schools still open. state that. Fucking cunt still draws paycheck arbitrarily deciding whose livelihood ""essential"". Deaths usually biggest Wednesday. Cases 16k great restrictions easing. Ya know? totally misinterpreted comment deserve downvotes stupid reply. 

I actually totally agree you. believe might discouraging mask usage due people stealing hoarding. happening. know hospital, none. got them, people stole them. lovely governmental org came cleaned us one point. So, tree work without wearing em. That’s caught Covid. also didn’t tests unless someone met specific criteria, clue assumed everyone did. Instead, suctioning lungs without protection. assumed recommendations least somewhat based also assuming wasn’t significant community spread. 
Of course know masks reduce spread anything droplet airborne, course plenty evidence Covid least droplet, even beginning. 

I assumed saying change recommendations evidence wearing masks now. bad. It’s something hear much though. Split VA + statehood DC. 3 states used 1. Deal? don’t think sauce claims. Judging rhetoric post history lot paper work shitty drugs/vaccines don’t work pushed Big Pharma. stands reason they’ve skeptical vaccines far. Push came shove though vaccine hitting British hospitals care homes next week. expect refuse eat crow around March they’ll stop posting vaccines instead harp silent transmission. play devil's advocate, worth mentioning year trauma anxiety inducing events like military combat, takes year get back normal ever Thanks explanation. banning alcohol struck odd read it, really understand going underneath.  I'd guess 23 years old. Humans never meant live isolation “quarantined” months. Social distancing avoiding gatherings family could worked weeks months? never gonna happen. opinion did. Several months ago. think there’s lot hope Oxford vaccine sort data. costs $3 conventional it’s stored. think Gates’ foundation work vaccinating third world countries well. Great job California! seem like contradict. wondering little bit we're seeing backlog Thanksgiving yet happen. 9/11 COVID similar mortality rates symptoms. Got it. matter incorrectly stated lie truth. isn't. commenter made lie spread misinformation. falsely state telling truth want insult people articles state things like. definitely stress comes from. Easy job overall aside possibly getting deadly virus. Thank sane. get nearly result want sample less hundred people. vaccine effectiveness questioned too. Love sub upvotes guy spreading fake news downvotes facts. I'm sure talking about. accidentally reply wrong comment?

My comment cheeky note landlord 'job', hardly. Can’t wait lose y’all next year packed big house  live one important cities state thats *extremely* low risk wildfires earthquakes. said nothing 
thanks fun fact! relatable thing I've seen day. :/ german, totally pissed right now. means 2021 completely fucked again. Moderna Biontech want produce 1.8 Billion doses vaccine next year. means, produce 450 million doses per quarter. get fucking 7 million them? one richest country earth also pumping millions euros development vaccine. Personally this, hope politicans get fucked next election next fall. shit like really happen. rest stay home safely travel. Thanks! Probs today, cases deaths peak Thursdays, could easily happen tomorrow Hell, even thought cartoon this. Ah ok... lucky you. Funny bring authoritarian laws Swedish respons bashed liberal.

No one said that. want able attend college classes person again. way it’s looking Canada though won’t vaccinated probably year everyone US there’s chance might final year degree online, isolated alone bedroom. thought makes want jump building pray whatever fuck we’re able get vaccine going well soon, least healthcare workers work public. 

Also, don’t think it’s going quite simple vaccine check able stuff like way pre-pandemic - like it’s going simple packed concert people verified vaccinated COVID. vaccinated doesn’t mean can’t spread it. It’s going take months vaccine available general public (which ways away still) anything feels remotely normal again. guess depends you’re at, least Canada that’s way seems. won’t facet life back COVID eradicated, seems.  delivering adequate care. Death rate soar switch focus older, sicker patients younger, healthier patients higher chances recovering. organisation keep silent vaccine news emerge. respect efforts made scientists. Except, many places US, pay test turned negative. selfish, ignorant fool making things worse allowing pandemic continue unabated causing millions suffer. want nationalist pissing contest, German vaccine, American company got manufacturing rights. Yes. grandma. felt fine, oxygen low. bought oximeter back May told check levels regularly. admitted likely would really bad. (She survived! 86!) real item get brought enough certainly novel virus therefore truly novel vaccine, many people also saying mRNA vaccines brand new simply true. normal approach vaccination used (i.e. attenuated), mean tested many years significant research put it. 

I agree want information released publicly specific details within trials, reality point, going simply accept there's way anyone make feel 100% safe taking something. Everything side effects everything could potentially harm someone. know yet. know many people face significant risk constantly exposed COVID perpetually circulating rest circles, propagating virus further. would stem also prevent worst infections vulnerable. fuck FDA waiting for? feel genuinely paralyzed fear idea going home Christmas, parents — nearly 60, one heart disease million preexisting health conditions — seem dead-set getting there. either plane trip multi-day drive. 

People keep telling good mental health see other, can't think anything *worse* everyone's mental health holiday ends people getting sick dying.

Am crazy reluctant? Folks know keep proposing clever workarounds compromises, arguing safe X someone else time. think potential consequences traveling, many news stories I've read people ""did everything right"" got anyway, stomach goes knotty. mean pharma companies get make massive profits new 'make penis hard' pills?

Like sorry name anything actually interact citizen blows. economy sucks, government sucks, healthcare sucks, education sucks, infrastructure sucks, transit sucks, energy backbone sucks, literally everything corrupt dogshit grift. Everything.

Like bomb people real good still guess.

e: except new warplane we're paying nose can't fly night near rain clouds maybe years can't even last thing. implied CANNOT inhale virus mask. corrected you. 

If like correction post sloppy sarcastic BS first place. I'm going correct precise claim one made (i.e., ""STRAWMANNING"" shit particles see frequently). dunno man, two months ago would told going patient wait deployed broadly I'd get it, someone offer pfizer vaccine right moment I'd take tears gratitude eyes. major equity issue teachers types plans. punishing special ed elementary teachers paying virtual teachers home amount. have. Thats grandma died 2014. Let’s forget New Years lol 
The whole planet going rough one January Astros really benefitted pandemic anyone. since seem know me.

so, would 60-65% effective stopping virus compared 94-95% pfizer/moderna?

That's certainly ok, good. I'd prefer pay premium (4x price) moderna one.


That take. understanding ""efficacy"" word here. Precisely, used. 64% time protects, means 36% chance still getting covid oxford vaccine?

&amp;nbsp;

so, advantages oxford vaccine temps (fridge temps) 1/5 price Moderna 1/8 price Pfizer...but cost 30% effective rate I'm curious middle Arizona desert nobody lives hotspot. Well go bankrupt two tenants end street. let rattle around little brain while. taxes finally push making nothing I'll evicting them, sitting property required time selling it. Thanks ever raising taxes people's outright hostility towards landlords two families getting bank take rental property. lovely bank charm. 

My job charity. job support two families own. Statistically, covid ***SHOULD*** mean would better getting vaccine, no? least current advertised effectiveness's vaccines way.

Basically, new vaccine supposed 95% effective, would expect see 1 ever 20 people get covid even vaccine(if herd immunity wasnt thing).

That means long 5% reinfection rate, would painfully obvious point pandemic still considered exceedingly rare, covid would mean protected protected 95% effective vaccine.

We need official CDC statement this, beause help us triage gets vaccine first. millions already nearly protected so, getting last. NYC. wont go actual prison. prob spend 4 hours jail cut loose. read theorising smaller lungs also leads spreading less. Tbh I've impressed little ones hygiene year. took pandemic teach sneeze elbows. experience them, flu vax, hasn’t good. Sure. shit ton really really good scientists basically whatever want. pretty great actually. Unfortunately half country hates science. Seems TABC entity seems capable making businesses comply threatening pull liquor license. Misinformation? article written estimated cost covid Vaccine beginning summer. estimated charge 3k per person maybe more. read mean misinformation. know, looked thought, minute, hey maybe that's bad idea...

... gotta honest I'm still pondering little. can't free healthcare noooooo VUUVUUUZELLLAAAAAA really ignores large portion state need much. roughly 8,000 people age 44 44,000 people ages 44-65 died virus date. awards unemployed underemployed barely getting working hours. many cases unemployed better even made money employed. embarrassing country treats employed dont make tons money. Phased trials clean track history decade vaccinating people ages. giant increase would say. within range expected weeks ago get worse much worse expect.

The two scenarios I'm afraid maybe third wave Christmas. spare capacity handle it. scenario somewhat stable level cases Sweden new normal spring. curve flatten. no. None that. covid denying BIL claims got melodramatic getting it. permanent lung damage. work nursing home caught every disease seemingly sun: every flu, every norovirus variety, etc. one point another years: never, ever felt horrible Covid lungs. I'd break bone daily nights running 102F fever basically coughing means breathing like, 6+ hours go. wish anyone. Everyone reading go state BMV sight make sure listed organ donor. must opt program states. done that, healthy organs go ground die. save many, many lives give massive quality life improvements many more. got spend extra 11 years uncle lung transplant. Without cousins would without father 8 11. wonderful soul completely changed entire family. (oxygen levels usually measured fingers/toes) usually (but always) considered O2 saturation 95% (94% NHS stated article).

From researchers looking 1,000 NHS Covid-19 hospital patients found even small drops one two per cent 96 per cent correlated ‘increased mortality risk’.

So even though they're within normal range considered hypoxic, drop one two per cent 96% shows increased mortality risk (and -- would add -- probably increased risk problems well). means landlord going evict Congress jerked around months nothing all? shoots

He scores

YOU SUCK Honestly, almost never hear anything many cases Florida, would say good 40-50% really care, anyway. Florida place would recommend avoiding. really. Russia good track record medical advancements. sure people keep assuming everything terrible. Yeah second time charm guess. ""modern"" ""rich"" western countries, yes absolutely shithole. little premature. Hopefully lead Western governments take communicable disease research seriously, socially people stop going work sick. 

People even stopped going work sick pandemic Yup. one understand truly debilitating happens them. well. Extra unemployment benefits end bummer get COVID day 13 20. one good thing? \*one\* good thing? never get large portion public buy in. miss big picture information Yes, one place world uses word bloody. said leaders somewhat competent Boris Johnson definitely not. can't wait boo Astros. I've waited full year boo garbage-bin-banging cheaters. Exactly, it’s gene therapy, rebranded. ITT: People understanding can't cake eat too.

If immunize fire fighters first wave, means delay completion immunizing first wave doctors nurses wait longer fire fighters using doses would gone them.

Firefighters younger fitter low risk complication Covid. much lower risk contracting covid say, meat packing plant employee, certainly lower healthcare workers.

Yes, like firefighters run burning buildings, also like nurses right nurses need vaccine firefighters fucking wait minute.

Shit, like meat packers? like, ""they're higher risk contracting complications, fuck them, firefighters""? Everyone wait turn. Pretty fucking stupid reply part, evidenced downvotes. you, much probably used thinking is. much rest us legitimately care simply cease exist, others world care shitty self could infect. sake, stop dolt. Read again, 3% deaths, 3% chance death. Stop living fear Yeah pretty funny every actual poll survey showed majority Americans wear masks go out, similar rate many european countries. fit America bad narrative, screw facts lol according you, can't get vaccine unsafe, can't social distance ""it's hard""

Viewpoints like reaching record numbers US. going part solution least try take everyone Hilarious would accuse calling liar.. called fool! 😂😂😂
And never answered question.. believe covid bud? Best thing since fried chicken still big deal. would call mild case. Fever 101 first day, took Tylenol went away forever. Chills went bed. cough sore throat. 3 days later lost smell taste 5 days. 

My job physically demanding. Working outside 100 degree weather 5 days week 8 hours day. thought irregular heart beat thought fatigued faster. wear Apple Watch everyday, looked back months didn’t corona; surprise maybe 1-5 BPM higher now. felt like more. tied anxiety virus, got thought gonna end hospital would progress worse. didn’t always felt like chest tight. wasn’t, shirt would get sweaty work would stick chest would breathe would make chest feel weird. 

Basically I’m trying say thought symptoms turned anxiety.

Also quit vaping, used buy 3 puff bars week. shit makes feel horrible morning night puffing puff bar. Yep, originally Tegnell problem admitting strategy was:

I'm pretty sure always takeout) it. Essential businesses allowed stay open pretty much every place said essential. first read ""U.S. could hit herd immunity end summer 2021 Americans embrace virus"". guess either way true. Yep, 2 shots. 21 day gap. Back pub? us Winchester whole time. I'm fine taking inauguration. Less chance fuckery. number 1 concern US deaths Covid. hospitalizations. healthcare systems overwhelmed, cause deaths go up. Two friends recently exposed required employer (they work restaurant) get rapid tests could come back work, even though restaurant closed exposed cook tested positive COVID. PCR tests cheaper, results come back fast enough would've risked getting fired take much time work.

They pay pocket tests employer requires rapid test, pay also offer health insurance.

As ACA plan: cheapest ACA plan ~$300/month $6800 deductible, actually less expensive pay penalty rather premium.

We live Georgia makes difference. Dvt? Soon bro. could see 20 million vaccinated Americans years end. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article True, guess wait regulating bodies finish reviewing data safety vaccine. Currently achieved studies.

The MHRA already done this, paving way others possibly follow suit. MHRA highly regarded independent body, resources move fast achieve this, take pharmaceutical companies word this, lot countres take note fact. ""Bloody Glad"" tells need know, Boris might better Trump comparing 1 day old shit 5 day old shit make former smell like roses. giving people country instead first? media reports overcrowded hospitals fear mongering? Really? Haha either amusing alarming. I’m going go someone didn’t pill morning. Yeah like testing supposed free available lmfao

I'll believe see insurer try stick $100 convenience charge whatever f virus march 2019 - left ear still muffled ringing :( Excellent original commentary state American society pandemic ADE could shown monoclonal / polyclonal antibodies convalescent plasma. antibodies vaccine also could stimulate ADE virus observed phase 3 trials. observed makes much less likely hiding reason sympathetic toward tenants? works ways. Says source? Last heard Reddit, Bill Gates donating millions dollars vaccine would low $3 citizen.

I think would great government offer free vaccines citizens. pattern people something painfully obviously good idea, blow face, ""oh, could known?"" infuriating. 😂😂 get frustrated people say ""we already locked down"" whatever. didn't. Many did. many didn't. therein lies problem. people pretend problem, bigger problem is. agree. perhaps equally vivid discussion life expectancy different countries homing COVID19. could probably save years/lives getting people give smoking. 

NOTE: I’m downplaying COVID19. It’s either-or kind game. onion article? Yeah know thanks, want check fully elaborate text reply (as someone likes type like do, believe you!) cause I’m wasting time rabbit hole. I’ll read synopsis since seems like time hands. 

I genuinely confused keep changing position. believe virus, reply global elite conspiracy theory Kool Aid somehow you’ve provided proof claims? graph referring to? final graph page clearly shows consistent sharp decline new deaths. No, I'm losing money currently since destructive tenant. must nice life black white. IL highest property taxes country, keep going up. got property rent can't keep taxes IL. Even happened, I'd imagine we'd get effective vaccine sooner later. Still, friggen miracle even year's end already several vaccines ready. Ik produced health restrictions lifted (in order get ASAP) yet see effective road makes 2021 much promising. actually know vaccinated people still shed virus, spread misinformation. specific news really huge, real big news vaccine's safety effectiveness officially announced. matter time country authorised use. someone immunocompromised, time anti-vaxxers. Nonsense. They're full Florida right now.

Or mean without infecting everyone? Yeah, year would great. know lot people work resturant industry staff say afraid covid come back work expect keep job unemployment ran out.

Guess what, employess came back asked 40 hour weeks people given like 8 hours week get fed quit. attaching moral/emotional value ""immunity"" way.  Almost half country cheered virus pretended exist. Post Viral Fatigue lingers fairly common viral infections. particularly unprecedented. three months PVF symptoms unknown infection couple years ago. taking temperatures entrance employer considered low risk like passing people store? employer trying justify employees physically sit scanning people vs buying automated machine much money spend potentially need machine months. new fairness doctrine includes internet would good start says charged immediately released, opening back tomorrow food only. watched Dolphins Bucs game? *far* full. rollout real phase III trial ""OOPS COVID"" - US cereal, would cereal. GOTTTTTT EMMMM dangerous place, meaning White House? /s scarves tho approved yet stop spread virus. nope, it.

But seem confused vaccine works. surprised.

Also, thanks addressing hypocrisy.

2600 dead US yesterday. 4 months ago said folks needed wash hands measures reaction.

Tell 270k dead US died severe COVID 19. Wait... can't see Week 44 onwards, case numbers almost identical except strange drop Swedish numbers Week 47?

The growth rate even actual number cases per capita practically identical Week 44 onwards. Considering Sweden started lower baseline, that's got disconcerting people believe Swedish strategy working.

As deaths, Sweden started much lower baseline narrowed gap considerably. Sweden's deaths per capita increased greater rate US'. Week 44 Sweden's number deaths per capita 47% US' number. Week 47 Sweden's number 75% US'.

Overall, Sweden's numbers track pretty closely US' except Sweden manage bring number cases deaths much lower US Week 25 Week 44.

By way... numbers taken [EU Try investing 5 seconds googling term ""rhetorical question""

The ""real enemy"" COVID enemy people fighting centuries, government. Draconian government overreach end killing far people COVID, that's guarantee... frustrating part I'm forced dick landlord never been. exempted one tenants 6mo rent daughter kidnapped held 10 days. something goes wrong day, flooding back fixed rental property own. One tenant we've 25 years. 

The pandemic even main issue, honestly ever increasing taxes. pandemic made things easier turned make break scenario yet. take much though. Pretty sure he’s already vaccinated probably ship doses vaccine approved hence slight delay. there's whole logistical challenge getting staff ready give vaccine doses never even said elderly, interpreted comment mean something correct, original comment flat wrong. I'm saying think meant say something correct said something bizarrely wrong instead, make everyone else wrong they're responding thing actually said.

Hopefully agree 50 year olds herd immunity 50 year olds vaccinated, half replies arguing against. Similarly, agreed several times actual elderly people managed care situations benefit quite lot people around vaccinated. followers Jesus. they'd wearing f'ing mask. FDA taking long? Brits get start taking Trumpicillin next week. UI/PUA/PEUC benefits end vast majority people. Something like 15 million people literally income. :( throw away job like I've exactly thriving this. I'm sorry hear unemployed.

Please research explain gap employment. explain several year gap. took advice found worked. Eh, reasons delay probably entirelt something would resolve simply throwing money it. Dinner cook faster pack kitchen extra chefs.  isn't. Maybe head, original comment framed argument people age 50 start getting vaccinated, give demographic herd immunity

It ""of possible age groups could vaccinate exclusively, 50+ would comparatively get partial immunity ones interact less age groups.""

That's it. said 70% 50+ people vaccinated, age group get herd immunity remaining 30% protected. said that's wrong. know seen negative reports, any. long hospital? friend monitoring home levels 88-92 going hospital today. It’s scary. 
“One patient SSM Health Janesville, Wisconsin, refused believe COVID-19 serious threat, even consumed him, said Dr. Alison Schwartz, infectious disease physician there. died, ""the family want admit patient died COVID, believe COVID kills people,"" said.”

My God, movie, I’d turn ridiculous. Yeeeep. great vaccine news is, really matter actually distributed public...which still months best away. IMMUNE I'm saying we're talking life insurance, health insurance. many fail understand God gave brain wanted use it. plently people willing take vaccine Fair point. Maybe Super PAX Prime haha. miss working hope someday job again, get housing again, maybe see podcast two live. sample size “study” even smaller, I’m sure take gospel. Yeah imagine one went Senate Congress 

None rooms windowsp Spaz Fuck I'm dreading bit. I'd imagine rare unknown ones brand new never approved mRNA technology. People focusing covid often forget diseases truly dangerous deadly, without secret agenda behind it. restrictions make immune system weaker, add financial struggles, stress impact negatively immune system. Immune system strong healthy decrease chances getting sick, majority people let's say 40-50 years old. (sometimes nature whatever wants sadly). get voted actually thinking clear mindset listening media news serving everyone. agree, elders ones focus, young people usually able something boost immune system naturally stay healthy. people like TV Zombies. I'll get voted well mind lol. many people reddit showering links like really know what's best every individual one. article “White House coronavirus task force report distributed U.S. states earlier week “

The report isn’t public ofc Bail punishment, it’s avoid people showing trial. Bail systems pretty unfair results poor people sitting jail pending trial wealthy people free awaiting trial. Trial sometimes months years away, way. It’s one reasons states, NJ example, getting rid cash bail altogether. I'm pretty sure downvoted helpful comment. ""Get rid capitalism"" without highlighting would get rid would replace would make average person better empty rhetoric. assuming medical technology 70 years ago? almost like every country world collaborated make vaccine century global pandemic? can’t even use one Apple made... gov (Ohio) decided participate all. How’s freedom? least give people option... geez. mean infection something taking vaccine? Sorry think misunderstood Grandma hired guy carpet said ""I wear mask I'm laying carpet"" FUCK n = 3 patients required lung transplants n = 2 people looked posthumously. 
Ground breaking stuff, really. Wouldn’t even call study Well fuck I'm going eating 10 meals one night lool LA way, really nice living city resources. I've gotten several tests throughout year free. Usually 30 minutes less get results within 24hrs-3 days (closer 24hrs last two months). thousands thousands tests available daily. unbelievable case everywhere that's bigger small rural town.  No, I'm not. matter think reasonable do, that's right. define personal risk tolerances different ways..and reason think compelled force adopt definition acceptable risk. think reasonable go bungee jumping, think right stop you. COVID. someone wearing mask want interact them, guess do? interact them.  


You're right. way thinking line socialist, government heavy-handed nations like China Europe; mine line traditional American thinking. ""May have.""
 Reddit Idiots: That's basically empirical scientific truth around here. [They Tax payers fund it. Increases taxes person approximately $1,000. 100% population get vaccine, person gets $1,000 back net zero cost government. people get vaccine worse off. one knows long immunity even lasts mRNA vaccines might interact provoke existing medical conditions. Note always reports hospitals soon overcrowded. they're precipice overwhelmed. Always. Despite months prepare, despite states closing overflow centers never saw handful patients. Totally agree. heavy overtime since began. 1 weekend month. small businesses got ppp loan earlier year blew supplies build. super overtime, I’m behind hell trying keep customer demand. HAHAHAHA 40 students barely data though. know it’s personal anecdote, know probably 10 college students who’ve covid none long term symptoms. fact couple even anything worse mild flu begin with. people job go back especially people restaurant industry, least job. job hunt people going difficult. mods please stop remove posts user Atealein. getting stupid! vaccines 90% effective rate appear 100% reported effective rate preventing COVID

France Spain dealing better UK? Vaccination vacation UK anyone? I'm sure getting from. experience academia watching news decade, use people poor countries lab rats. anything, Africa likely last ones get vaccines industrialized world feels comfortable covid rates.

I remember 4 years ago America testing new Ebola vaccine people angry shipping test African children. Sick thinking laws nature. pandemic end nature says so, Spring. rollout real phase III.

100% Look, obviously lot disagreement surrounding virus think normal, sane person would argue fact virus real dangerous. part rubs lot people wrong way apparently individual freedom live life, things good. things get bad, it’s understood masses freedom taken away name health safety. Even damaging fact many people didn’t even question government overreach furthermore, demonized people did. country claims healthy democracy MUST question type extreme government overreach, even overreach name public health. make person uneducated, selfish murderous. also doesn’t mean mitigation’s shouldn’t place slow spread virus.

We opened Pandora’s box mark words, another reason global shutdowns next decade barley anyone question it. seem asking question. Ask question get removed. Haha, true, sad true. Even lockdown, people shelter-in-place point prevent worsening outbreak though wishful thinking. someone deals rare chronic disease...it gets better. resilience increases develop grit plus effective coping mechanisms. 

It's shock realize healthy least permanently adjust. 

I share gallows humor snark I'm largely pretty positive proactive overall. Partly point recognize control control.

Hang tough! Awesome, that's great news me. wife treats COVID patients Strong outpatient clinic attached hospital. Presumably means she'll least second line vaccine. Thanks sharing! There's subreddit long term symptoms may offer support answer questions. Take care. r/covidlonghaulers Im slightly worried vaccines said take long time “perfect” years-ish, however vaccine done 9 months? 

Im vaccine coming reducing covid numbers would impact us people? 

Have reports bad side effects? Risks taking vaccine accomplished less year? 

Expecting Long term side effects ? least third country strongly opinion bandaids sissies, gunshot. Probably get sweet sweet bonus year?? Idm crowdfunding bonus awesome scientists made vaccine possible world. think health insurance providers going overlook pre-existing COVID conditions? CDC literally updated standard reflect this. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Haha worries. Everyone reddit seems assume everyone else man anyway (I even find it). amount psychological manipulation Trump campaign used staggering. People really understate amount nefarious psychological shit used long lasting implications country. science understood point. MRNA vaccines largely untested thousand people trial equal hundreds millions wild never approved past due low effectiveness trigger aggrevate autoimmune conditions. also way knowing brand new mRNA vaccine interact pre existing medical conditions. deaths per day part anti-covid subreddits, ignore fools see ""fucked up"" thing situation. company provides service. owe shit.

The Trump asskissers gone soon. lower decks lost sight vision, trust continue work passionate safety. absolutely hilarious watching Reddit switch blaming every problem world boomers old people pretending care without slightest hint cognitive dissonance? placed task force explicitly views (views also espoused president liberate tweetstorm)

Far ""extreme"" herd immunity strategy favored administration. anything recent shift mitigation measures caution ""extreme"" views. refuse give pardons. article supply chain logistics less development vaccines themselves. can't beat them, might well join them. one thankful work entire time. Okay cool. Apparently allow questions. execute stupid. Stupid type evil allowing existence doom others.  But... got 99% survival rate!! /s Yeah, note much better medical masks cloth masks area high exposure.

Masks work. source proves it. Still better “paper lockdown” Fauci said could hit “relative normal” April June

This sub: yeah lol consider LOGISTICS? huge huge mistake part anyone else said this, people would quite upset. many NYC alone died virus though? vaccines side effects tiny percentage people take them.

If hoping vaccine chance side effects, never get one. also imagine virtually unlimited instant funding also helped process. mean typically sort funding immediately available Stadia don’t evidence either direction, know people stronger immune systems kill virus faster. 

We know people immunized stronger, efficient immune reaction.

Therefore say it’s reasonable prediction people immunized clear virus faster.

We know R0 directly correlates amount time you’re contagious fairly linearly. 

So it’s reasonable prediction immunized population significantly reduces R0.

At broader scope, many vacccines work.

Besides, alternative goes literally forever, hang myself, soooo Lol. Yes. vaccine prevents infected cause disease immune system has...wait it...killed virus.

Your drug phase II trials September.

Poor investment, bro. Still waiting facts said easily found. Thanks concern.

*everyone cool think they're falling it* overwhelming attitude Texas ""wear mask want to, scared (or elderly sickly) stay home, rest us think Coronavirus thing bullshit, we're going live lives like normal"". start pandemic, alcohol based hand sanitizer short supply. Like impossible get major retailers. got batch brewery looked back. High alcohol, minimal ingredients, works great.

Now less issue might help mitigate huge supply tainted hand sanitizer. This, proven, lower cost opening large swath previously abandoned sanitizers.  keep simple, put mask leave home, take get back. Imagine amount lives could saved everyone followed easy task. Medicine for-profit venture. Yes, think moral. think immoral take one person's wealth force pay another person's welfare. Good thinking. Covid-19 chance negative effects, want pandemic go long possible, let's give vaccines.  well, better damn well I'm door principle.
 
The moment employer anything say happens medically body (more what's already imposed due stress workload) start look someone new. Yes, gotcha :) country going emerge pandemic really fucked. Maybe 500k citizens dead? knows many cases. health care system brink collapsed (or already collapsed). Citizens other’s throats politics. economy toilet. dread things 6 months less. 

The bright spot vaccine coming. Let’s hope “criminal actor” doesn’t hijack distribution process (black market) profit. 

I hope I’ll remember read post year able laugh stupidity. I'm making estimate based fact hospitals, large, completely overrun like coming soon. Yes we've gotten better treating COVID that's beds doctors available people treated.

I'm probably wrong I'd rather wrong high end. makes assume everyone staying AirBnB vacation? I've consistently said masks never go away.

Masks definitely ""go away"" sense required enter places. think people continue wear masks experiencing cold/flu-like symptoms, people going throwing bin end 2021. second this. Zoom, movie marathon, special takeout cook special meal, maybe grass you’re that. boat here.  We’ve 8 months change new review process. knew coming. needed put place whatever necessary get approval expedited quickly possible. say UK process legitimate anybody takes longer unnecessarily letting people die. true somehow Russia better almost entire western world inventing rolling vaccine. Either they’re really great we’re really bad deaths primarily among people 75+ hospitalizations pretty consistently high among age groups 45+.

Once two things come down, wont lot reason go back normal literally, LITERALLY, zero chance cronies anything delay vaccine much 1 second. FDA gives go, NY immediately passing vaccines fast possible. seasonal flu vaccine usually lower efficacy this, maybe 60-80% given year. vaccine perfect work, means vaccinate people. efficacies SARS-Cov-2 vaccines high really, really good thing. Yesterday history. everything Trump. 

Plenty politicians ignored precautions restrictions expect constituents others follow them. 10 days feels like long time wait meeting.... People dying every day, vaccine already made ready distribution, trial already finished. government working day night whatever takes get red tape (while still making sure everything safe course). could get vaccine rolled mid December instead late December could mean thousands people saved think anyone boof it? car's brakes tendency working cold climates, would write disclaimer stating it. I'd sell car areas hotter climate wait engineers find root cause.
Doesn't seem fair? Except Americans aren’t ones getting Vaccine, UK US :) really, you’d travelling another continent, unvaccinated. us don’t choice. Essential company covers US means I’m still fly. Please read [this article prison explain already covering necessary expenses prisoners.

Also, fuck grandparents parents getting first. incarcerated brother option social distancing.

Leisure shopping best! end ""Supermarket Sweep"" shopping extra anxiety regret, sign up!! make stuff. Benzalkonium chloride common hand sanitizer ingredient non-alcohol sanitizers. low risk individual, I'm worried statements like catching covid. reason would take parents higher risk.

Guess wanted sun get house . Extrapolating, nearly everyone Florida would without masking? Obviously someone slips cracks imperfect system. Supposedly possibility random test airport arrive contract tracing know solve without completely closing Hawaiian border. Plus people go stores dont require masks, would go store requires mask go road another store doesnt require mask. naturally occurring reverse transcripase like implying. also integration machinary required. mechanism describing. like virus infects us. Unless think influenza going spontaneously integrate genome. course aren't, flu increase risk cancer. vaccine. sincerely doubt ever formal end masks. slowly disappear, people businesses stop saying anything. mean “us”? Lol think I’ve figured out, key sub timing, avoiding key phrases, sounding snarky enough sound educated enough yo condescencing


Nah I’m kidding every comment fucking coin flip county officials (county judge, county commissioner, commissioner's court, etc...) many Texas counties decreed governor's state level mandates enforced within respective counties. Could sheriff, constables, deputies defy enforce mandates anyway? I'm sure. think directly jurisdiction county officials, ultimately answerable state. would could? know it. Dude you’re really embarrassing genuinely think aerosols passing masks one? Try blow candle one on. still far know. lining FDAs approval process. mandatory. quit lose benefits. Disappointing medical professionals stupid know sure. willing go record saying human beings lives for-profit venture? think moral secular religious level? Yeah, masks cause problems stores psychos cause scene they're asked wear them. Lol sound lame bc took said warped widely available vaccine = june rather it’s expected earlier

But yeah they’re independent trump. common knowledge btw haha. Head warp speed literally said he’d quit fucking job politics interfered 

Just stay indoors forever bro. aren’t estimates, Fauci along experts. 

Normal May remains good estimate. vaccine tested 55+ demographic, reason Putin never vaccinated? Presumably choice matter purchasing vaccine? Ultimately, whole population gets Oxford vaccine virus die able spread enough hosts.

There rumblings Oxford vaccine trial far accounted asymptomatic cases findings. Hence lower efficacy others counted symptomatic. yes, price storage logistics make Oxford current leader distributed globally. haha shut down? haha see goes? argument could made speeding. puts people risk dying. speeders given jail too?

There’s reason don’t let family members victim decide punishment. They’re close want revenge. don’t want revenge. want what’s best society. Putting people prison best society. kids? take care them? happen lives? put prison, they’ll certainly lose jobs. you’ve turned productive members society wards state. 

Fine $10,000 give 100 hours community service. Enough stop anybody else considering without unnecessarily ruining anybody’s life great expense state. Totally! even smaller can’t wait leisurely stroll around damn Target put bunch shit don’t need cart instead hurriedly grab need try avoid humans sycophant right word use here? Staten Island NYC's American South. nursing director said we'll getting first batch shipped Dec 14th! Local leaders believe we'll vaccinating general public early spring. Aw yeah! Overwhelming number people drink drive fine too. recommend though. sounds like Onion headline lol ICT friend. people get information networks even know ICT works. may phone hand clueless technology behind tech infrastructure undoing society know it.

This major problem world today, less less people understand science various forms technology result science.

So old people clueless same. Including me. Science technology become specialized, one clear broad understanding anymore. read paper quantum physics may well magical incantation, medical virological study...

We know metaphor car mechanic used able repair car...until put little boxes chips regulate breaks gasoline mixtures...

In same, ironic way, - something amazes one seem picked yet, again, McLuhanist well technorealist - schools today use ICT computer technology widely used, school longer neutral organization gain knowledge, sub come rely one specific aspect technology: ICT.

And kids schools today learn superficial aspect technology science using technology indoctrinates use none get wiser irony one explains ICT effects society.

Age barely issue. deep failure society given science specialized difficult follow longer. 

And return fact society hundred years ago. use technology, uses us sometime soon predict, see first killings scientists.

Already people distrust science. used church persecute them. Soon disenfranchised masses, evangelical atheist join forces chase people white lab coats. getting 5k? things undoubtably going get worse, deaths mid late December already diagnosed now. 150,000 deaths day would need effective ~3%diagnosed death rate hit 5000 day. aren’t testing enough, aren’t testing *that* much. haven’t 3% since early summer, clinical treatments refined substantially since bad reading. lol hell even wasting time two for?  It’s like Lenin said...

I walrus? Now, discovered joy walking around alone close family? Alone thoughts beauty nature... something that.  I'm fairly staunch liberal 100% agree thing seen mentioned yet multiple studies indicating firefighters often end impaired lung function due job exposures, making susceptible virus after-effects. Spring 2022 going awesome. disgusted know this, lmao. SOUND LAMMMMMEEEEEEE quoting head department putting much trust can't bothered read statement.

Also, think Warp Speed independent Trump probably also would type person thinks we'll back normal June...oh wait.

Good luck hope, though. I'm rooting right fuck, right? would root anything getting back normal? 90% people getting money making WAY money ever made entire lives loving every second it.

On top that, throw away jobs care absolutely incentive get back work. biggest question always - alcohol non alcohol - hands covered it, kill virus without rubbing in? apple.news may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

So yeah fuck virus disease. stop man killing me. keep making things up.

The virus CAUSES disease. isnt disease virus. really research dont understand reading.

Goodbye. Employee health can’t get hospital workers come back PPD readings....getting everyone back second dose vaccine going nightmare!! I'm never getting rid mine, always wanted use masks always felt awkward think good evidence saying here. Since said Air BB, can't help think ""vacation"" purposes. so, then, honest question: vacation getting city, new old you, explore get away know? hell point traveling somewhere hunker Air BB?

I mean sound insensitive that's gathered info given. they? means high school college seniors maskless jam packed graduations proms next spring 2021, yes, no? article headlines would argue irresponsible, dangerous completely immoral. 

Anyone basic understanding epidemiology could explain cases rise 1-2 weeks hospitalizations rise deaths/ICU visits lag another week that. 

The fact headline implies lockdowns work dangerous. flown twice since pandemic started made one cross-country drive. brother dying pancreatic cancer and, since lived 1200 miles apart, going miss chance see died. died October, daughter flew memorial service. trip, always wore mask careful. also quarantined returning. tested negative trip regrets. travel necessary, done safely. Asian, I'll say Fuck China.

goodluck, expected asians, yall racist af too. Thank you—this, right here. I, too, close family member whose life saved organ donor. Organ donors save lives simple kindness costs nothing. forever grateful unnamed woman saved family member generosity death. think people think overrated place high value service.

(if actually turns way. scientist course never assume result, you.) Yes, worry well. wording cost many lives already. cant wait revisit comment theres outbreak zombies there. That's stupid. Damn realize fortunate CA regards unemployed system. still get unemployment working full time hours also get possible stimulus money well. No, really say that. Birx attempting damage control keep job put class Fauci. sliminess idiocy forgotten. governments telling doctors nurses wear thing encouraged public it.

Crappy masks won’t help much, know makes good mask now, plenty materials it.

I go Amazon get massive pack surgical masks known quality pennies pop.

I hundred N95’s left buying wife’s clinic back January/February people realized happening, hopefully hospital never needs those, climate controlled storage over.

Definitely got shitty messages onset, hopefully figure next one hits, don’t want kids put nonsensical fringe reaction masks precautions. pointless all. They’re Duke University doing, prototype done. Last week like 16000 tests came like 21 positives potentially increase time prison. actually choice. That's happened Y2K. ton software engineers worked ass solve problem, people like ""overblown hoax"" absolutely wasn't. end world, would've shit show. Honestly, air B&amp;B beach self contained vacation. say Floridian done family vacations beach houses coast. need understand beach towns offer little outside great hole wall food, staying house isn’t missing much places adopted delivery now. Beaches mostly homes less crowded public access areas, it’s easy spend lot time outdoors distanced.

Will vaccines first roll out? Probably not, since it'll mostly old folks health care workers. 

When solid chunk vaccinated? Maybe, even seems vaccines rule asymptomatic spread. 

Will get vaccinated? Maybe, even then, think it'll approved kids quite time, newborn. take chance getting spreading asymptomatically her?

When practically everyone vaccinated? us mofos gonna hiding soon. mean shit government say. plenty evidence airborne spread since January. March extremely forgiving.

There reason say anyone wear masks. Oh thank you, THANK silly, 'the people'. They'll forget find new reasonable person outraged less two weeks. Here’s I’m uncertain about. Let’s say large percentage Americans choose get vaccine disease drags needlessly long. case choices affect - scenario pose risks vaccinated. haven’t seen discussed anywhere.

I go take subway shopping. Always wear two masks. one Coway HEPA Purifier living room, one room, Merv 13 box fan filter bathroom running. 

I guess avoid it. even meet family Thanksgiving, still 20 person gathering, instead 40 usually. 

All take ibuprofen/acetaminophen gets better. Luckily 26, really hope get worse point. hospitals already run close 100% capacity lot time - least reach frequently. add whole lot people top regular load, supposed go? Many, many people work nursing homes, group homes, long-term care facilities considered ""health care workers"". called DSP's (direct support professional), overlooked hazard pay states. hope someone CDC aware includes them. Yeah, Trump recommended masks downplay virus weeks first hit US. followed lead. another SF voter, cardinal sin bad look. Living high life dictating bars/eateries open many people serve, enjoying meal TFL good look.

It's bad trying get brother prison manslaughter, though. Geezus, that’s savage. Yeah I've seen plenty maps like Millions dead! honestly rich killing poor feels like ultimate aim federal response far Makes feel better repair person came house yesterday. We've hardcore lockdown ever since thing started, furnace stopped working, someone in. trying stay room in, course, still worried. people local animals, huge problem invasive species destroying local fauna flora everywhere. check problem australia rabits piton everglades Turkey considered part Europe whole. Obviously Hey guys, brace yourselves, we’re fucked... general agree, limits everything. Warp speed head also thinks normal May. looks like another conservative Fauci estimate yeah, hype levels ceiling plz mean also supposed travel unless necessary. Napa close SF people might think.

It's message sends actually breaking rules. isn’t news.. already common knowledge thought? seriously thought onion headline first sister situation. Someone helped move psychologically abusive situation stay basement. new roommate guests wouldn’t wear mask house. sister still chemo surviving breast cancer. little money ended moving back abusive spouse. understand hate can’t help. people understand? I’m sorry you’re going fear. fair Sweden 10 million people. state live 25. Sweden also population density 25 per square mile. state 400. wore proper mask (the ones actually filter air) + eye protection might relatively safe.

But bet wearing flimsy cloth mask people around often wear none all.. Half read studies right. 70% would enough. Glad finally optimistic something tho. *Obama No, varies disease disease. mumps, example, 80% population needs vaccinated remember correctly.

People undergoing cancer treatment, babies (even though seem quite safe covid), whose immune systems compromised can't vaccinated. Oh clever. laughed hard. Might wake neighbor tell em joke welcome! website bunch good charts/graphs metrics. I'm going dentist Friday makes feel much better *""Thank God live US would never happen.""*

I think overly optimistic US. They've ordered hundreds millions doses make sure people take one way other.

Hopefully resort incentives rather threats force, underestimate US government's willingness pretty _anything_ get needle arm... I’m praying OK wears masks there. kind want think next pathogen goes pandemic. all. remember reading U.S.S. Theodore 1,100 personnel tested positive one death. MMR vaccination mandatory pointed question correlation. super interesting would help knowing provides enough protection children since probably won’t get vaccine approval much later.

Can anyone ask MMR booster? course, normal person normal instinct self-preservation use excuse suddenly start ignoring reasonable pandemic restrictions. bad ruled idiots, kinda knew already. mean, try one can? I've eaten lot nice places work birthdays amazing, lots food normally would never see plenty food normally see totally different way. better great burrito? Maybe? would normally believe that, current election seeing many people still wanted Trump president, makes really lose hope America. I’ve never happier. dozens us! edgy name, bro. approvals right adults. Next teens, older kids, younger kids then...

Also - 95% effective means 1 20 vaccinated people still get sick 1 20 billions still lot. mods jokes - they’re random people. takes 2 clicks make new sub become mod. want drive car badly right now, health responsibility? Yeah trouble tests. used teach Los Angeles Unified School District, would imagine super strict testing. sensitive skin last time got TB test, skin red, slightly raised itchy wanted get chest xray done said happened think false positive. doctor investigating told fine go home without chest xray. relieved since meant spend extra money result already knew. hated getting test every 2 years. understand done sorry honestly it. anyone left South Dakota math bad. 

Statistical analysis says 50k people large enough sample size see side effects within confidence interval like 95%.

Maybe 14% drugs get approved, it’s like 2/3 drugs make phase 3 get approved. really anymore (although ranking 3 Michelin start restaurants another thing) pretty revolutionary came out. CA staple sure, chef, Thomas Keller, quite famous brought food world. check-the-box thing foodies now. good sight follow rules make. also slightly invalidates message I'm turn validates weird conspiracy theories (eg covid restrictions controlling population guise virus). Thank you! Hugs you, too. Sounds like piece shit. think learn judge others experiencing something, like say covid, again. Saying open shit up, experienced dying crowded hospital yet. actually despise people like you. capable learning seeing hypocrisy. Well shit Fascists get genocide one way another Pog shit! Workers locked burned due swamped people locked down. I'm going say no?  see happens 3 weeks

Why 3 weeks, something happen recently? Yeah original removed article bunch flips justify point, think total deaths 2020 vs 2019 shows people dying year. link us-currently-hospitalized. thinking get state level data. hours later came life. Thx. Man... realized going deal stories dumbass put vaccines wrong freezer / store correctly &amp; spoiled use. Fingers crossed caught make people's arms. ""spending"" either Canada U.S central banks create credit without good know. reassuring someone nervous all. thanks fucking crazy SHIT, sure, lockdowns per constitution cannot, goddamn restrictions businesses failing left right restrictions. Generally, people good staying home they're sick employers implemented rules so.

We friend Netherlands calmer summer months, said restrictions met less people week regular day Netherlands, stuff week. Toothless ineffective policy making. Shut bars restaurants. Every day going cost lives. OJ Simpson killed 2 people long time ago cut slack. /s I'm working home can't wait around people office again. miss people. 

Sure enjoy rolling bed laptop, miss clients coworkers eating lunch friends. 

Work satisfying used be. What? mean I've rich whole time even know? I'm saying works time. huge gathering like Rose Garden event. certainly hurt, along precautions. Florida? lot.

They still believe whole thing hoax.

People whatever hell feel like, think masks halloween Batman.

My plan stay home home least Groundhog Day get vaccination, whichever comes first. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  used find kinds sites. I'm looking CDC comes up. weird. Ye good luck cobra-chickens Novavax Russia. nothing that. reducing stress hospital system. 

One outbreak regular sized nursing home easily result 10-20 hospital admissions. One nurse COVID infect quarantine whole shift nurses, mention doctors. Eliminate one biggest sources hospital COVID admissions, avoid losing workers sickness/quarantine, we've least backed couple steps rather walking cliff. mean tell country done basically nothing federal level combat deadly virus 10 months hotbed infection virus?

Sounds like fake news me. /s countries get Oxford, Novavax, Chinese Russian vaccines.

Moderna Pfizer/BionTech vaccines expensive need efficient cold chain distribution, also limited supply end 2021. get rid Affordable Care Act. precondition ban that. need degrees jobs countries? Okay, one actually *cried* seeing this? can’t one, right? unbelievably huge moment. Remember Makes sense someone go out. Peoples judgement lowers fun happens. Oh glory days. Serum Institute India supposed supply 1 billion doses third rate 100 million doses month. going global rollout like we've never seen before. Source? saying believe you, I'd like read detail. I’m fucking mad. man politicized pandemic gain caused countless cases suffering death. enough enough? Sensible people change behaviour virus rife - cases drop bit things get exposed often. Like soylent green? I’m pretty damn optimistic excellent Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine approved mid-Dec time frame, especially considering UK approved it! Yall fuckin? grew thinking America would dream place, life could better. slowly changed thinking America place I'd go years make bank, get fat die inside decade.

Now wanna go all. Maybe national parks living sounds like hell. China switches back blaming US Covid.
Also inaccurate title.

Tuesday, December 1, marks one year since first known patient showed symptoms disease Hubei provincial capital Wuhan, according key study Lancet medical journal. go indoor dinner party instead. rules bogus vaccine approved almost every European country apart U.K. Hopefully won’t long them. (Drops Monocle)

             - UK think 3rd world countries find way, humans powerful, even powerful loved ones dies.

We went 2020, think everyone come around help distribute without stock, can't even think that. FUCKING BACK BOYS confirm definition ""hotspot"" everywhere tho?  No, ends. covid cause additional deaths related covid, e.g. increased suicides, additional deaths people don’t want go doctors, etc. measuring deaths directly related covid misses lot people suffering. completely incorrect? census site actually puts population little 330 million - Really wish would focus drug clearly kills covid proven big focused people want make money vaccines.... world sick. true link source? Ty so! Amazing news. pay people take vaccine get nightmare with! No, announced 29th latest.

Straight source:

If data submitted robust enough conclude quality, safety effectiveness vaccine, EMA’s scientific committee human medicines (CHMP) conclude assessment extraordinary meeting scheduled **for 29 December latest**. haven’t, have. Don’t group dumbfucks Sad quit glad throw building. old ones likely land ITU/ICU mechanical ventilation beds. also likely disease.

Well October (I think) government approved amendment approval process allowing MHRA grant approval covid vaccine without wait EMA so. hadn’t done we’d waiting rest Europe.

I’m clear it’s imminent Brexit Jan 1st allowed it’ll said victory Brexit I’m sure. KY able walk urgent care get test symptoms go within 5 minutes results next morning. crazy places refusing tests.

Look toward Dec. 10 meeting. It'll probably around best thing people Western countries help get vaccines third world countries sooner volunteer clinical trials. second round vaccines deployed poorer countries essentially delayed right can't enroll volunteers fast enough. 

I'm part distributed team made site called [COVID Trial Dash](http://coviddash.org) maps trials currently recruiting. offer payment, free testing, 50% chance getting vaccine. Highly recommend least taking look seeing there's one near you.

Except didn’t provide proof, fact article linked proved *exact user posted spreadsheet cases reporter days/weeks advance nailed them.

That back end January, kinda close wasn’t. lasted week. know quadratic regression works you’d know that’s education holds weight gold, especially now.

I know, kinda wish actually reading original article linked. know means? Keep damn nose mask. Pretty much every government document least classified official use only. People familiar Gavin Mcinnes know Yeah, ever asked, ""Would politicians lie break rules?""

You idea perks political power even small doses USA. Cue George Carlin... Covid vaccine approved UK Oh shit okay Normal I’m vaccinated. I’m seeing people, dining wherever open looking back. many middle income Americans loads credit card debt. can't stand waiting even little want. Brace everyone turning vampires.... (I legend much?) 

NB I'm antivaxer. made second video died day? Nov 23? Jesus! talking fine! also put filthy room, think mentioned.

US dream ! due fact Travelers listening advice experts including Health Human Services National Institutes Health Antony Fauci travel. travel Thanksgiving get test COVID-19. Political discussion COVID-19 go r/Politics One greatest failings Swedish culture abhorrence dissent. West recognized socialists lambasted authoritarian dictators. However really ""authoritarian dictatorship"" problem, unwillingness culture allow self criticism. went clearly inhumane wrong complained time ignored. saw stories Reddit never even made press Sweden far know let alone discussion politicians. America opposite problem, views expressed equal vast swathes population believe Covid-19 exists. Total lack social cohesiveness kills too. think mixture contempt suffering others, disinterest what's true. bought enough vaccine vaccinate everyone canada 10x over. problem buying them. Distributing logistics bane. 3rd world countries hottest regions earth, limited electricity, transportation located remote areas. vaccine needed kept -70C° No, publicly announced 29th December earliest. January 12th moderna jab. Oh kettle stove perfectly acceptable. saucepan stove, however, not. Doesn’t change point. Sorry, data come months ago? worst fucking bot. begins... They’re literal heroes eyes British electric kettles 3kw boil water tea couple minutes; stove tops can't make tea fast enough! think repost reply moderator, me. read here. may seen stories recently Pfizer/Biontech vaccine landed US logistics set moving vaccines hospitals already making plans vaccine distribution. anticipation FDA approving around 12/10 meeting. Essentially, would pretty big shock approve next week.  Anybody know problem getting Pfizer moderna vaccine first (I healthcare worker) astra Zeneca vaccine later? want reduce risk first, I’d also like covid-sterile can’t pass others. Yeah think might OP's case well. Unless live apartment building, might understandable. think meant literally literally, would get mail? Sweden nothing. 
They late weak rules compared European countries. Oh, like, sovereign? Yeh shit hahaha Australia anywhere like 50 cases hot spot us. states like fucking supernova I'm UK atm cried lil bit.
My grandma vaccinated!
My parents likely vaccinated early next year!
I worry myself, abroad away vulnerable family members scariest thing me. good fucking news. Yep sure guy would think otherwise. mean little unique fact comprised many countries/nations. UK 100% country. Also. something would expect BBC get wrong lol. AstraZeneca producing poorer countries well China mom admin assistant hospital. left job one regular doctor’s office COVID ward building. definitely make enough money deal exposed that. 

I commend nurses treating COVID patients risking lives so. really paying more, also testing more. US nurses shortage pandemic. It’s something need adequately deal with. One step could take expanding nurses programs state colleges community colleges. pandemic, nursing program local community college three year waitlist, ridiculous there’s shortage. sure say ""GYNA FLEW""? point well made. Maybe? think first wave disease still spreading, reacted largely locked summer happened (where transmission dropped dramatically).

Second wave, disease already practically everywhere, nowhere beyond nations really 'under control', capable spreading everywhere simultaneously colder weather came in. cyber covid driving rush hour traffic car vs ambulance sirens Politicians stupid. Politicians lie. Politicians multiple sets rules, lenient reserved themselves, family, friends.

This new. thinking debit cards, credit cards (at least major ones use - VISA, MC, AMEX etc). Apparently not. guy says small villages even able considered backwoods areas. they’re legal “trouble,” may permitted leave state. custody agreement requires parent share parental supervision, may permitted move state. tenth? not... like now? UK regulator launched rolling review on 30 October, and analysed less data made available EMA.   evaluate partial data are doing they also take minimum risk,"" EMA's former head Guido Rasi said.   would expected robust review all available data, British government done to be able to say without Europe come first,"" added. 

This appears key difference. we're handed 100 pages analyse analyse 100 analyse half, would surprised finished first call 50 pages red tape?  Meanwhile banana stand.. knew that. Paywall Rare may be, doesn’t take away fact happened, it’s effecting family greatly. continue happen unless people taking precautions virus. exactly small must census area consider ""backwoods""? single family county? overwhelming odds fine young healthy

The problem statement there's whole lot 'just fine' 'dead' disease. friends 'long haulers' otherwise young healthy. social media groups weightlifting mountain biking becoming common seeing people post deal reduced exercise capacity. 'young healthy' , lift ride bike every single day absolutely everything get disease could affect ability things. know odds favor 25-30% showing long term symptoms, consider hysteria everything power avoid contracting covid 19. Interesting oder.. would think young person serious underlying health condition get priority 80 year old one, I'm doctor. true, also reckon unlikely long term effects last long body. likely trigger extreme immune response certain unlucky people cause short-term damage turn cause long lasting effects. that's case, hear sooner rather later. probably heard phase 3 clinical trials. Well vaccine authorised use enter phase 4 involves continuous monitoring people received try find kinds rare effects. found, rollout stop immediately. I'm sure biggest advertisement campaign ever created telling go get vaccine radio, TV's, internet, etc. least you’re ahead deaths positive cases.  blood hands approval delayed burocracy. good friend viral immunologist one top immunology labs world (for now- she’ll starting lab soon!). weren’t involved making vaccines intimate knowledge immune system works. read articles covid vaccines you’ll see PI quoted place. 

I talked posible long term side effects couldn’t catch months long trial wasn’t worried all. says she’ll take vaccine soon it’s offered. 

Really thing worry RARE adverse reactions, mysterious long-term ones. Rare side effects can’t really detected clinical trials- even really long ones- case vaccine different other. It’s likely happen, don’t get freaked them. danger long-term side effects covid much higher likelihood long term side effects vaccine. Even healthy young people. Bring one? said social distance need united ermagherd... /s UK made first approval analysis partial data whereas EU want assess data. Governments already removed liability issues vaccines makers least assess data rolling Ok I’m getting nervous - doctor appt today I’ve put months always thought numbers blown up, can’t avoid anymore. nervous I’m going get virus there...but don’t go, might issues. Ugh. guess risk blood pressure issues instead? hell supposed do??? Oh... let's can't afford stay home without  subsequently lose jobs [they also lose healthcare received work begin  even nurses tested positive [being asked report work Hail science seem feedback governments give chance vaccine approved. **QUESTION**

*So mom corona mom caught too. sent grandmom aunt (moms sisters) house. aunt caught isolating.

Basically mom halfway recovered asked go take aunts place take care grandmom (Gmom weak needs support hence cant leave alone) 

Would detiorate moms health? Since hasnt recovered yet going front someone already it?* Ohhh, would think would start looser resitrctions? 50+ age group vaccination earlier?? factors sort cancelled fact Spanish flu virulent deadly, far COVID ever could be. finish Phase III test? Bingo. Need admit heard much Switzerland handled pandemic. Gotta look up. Rabies highest effectiveness vaccine I'm aware of. 100% people generate neutralizing antibodies given properly. like 50 failures 150 million vaccinations. one vaccines still work given *after* exposure.  thanks “We experiencing higher usual rates infections state, Legislature members immune that. citizen Legislature, expected legislators risk citizens represent.”

Most people dumber citizens represent and, unsurprisingly, luxuriate irresponsible behaviors. put facade champions small business spreading virus, undermining consumer confidence placing businesses position losing revenue. That's really sad...also sad President retweeting something like fake news show virus ""isn't bad"". troll deliberately dumb? covid19 scam. Fails kochs postulates. Scammers rebrand healthy people asymptomatic. scam. Indeed, EU countries. UK still bound follow EU rules, new EU rules, Pfizer vaccine must authorised EMA, EU countries use emergency procedure allows distribute vaccine home temporary still subject EU rules fully leaves bloc end Same. I’ll super enthusiastic going local bar getting beer. Breastfeeding too. daughter turns 1 May I’m thinking we’ll wean then, though wasn’t original plan. masker huh? 

He now. 70% Americans wear masks, compared 60% Germany, less places Northern Europe.

It’s US full anti-mask idiots. 70% Americans wear masks, compared 60% Germany, less places Northern Europe.

It’s US full anti-mask idiots Bad mentality. Especially reach point aren’t enough healthcare workers beds tend sick. Bad enough get Covid. get Covid everyone else Covid; that’s position want in.  Unexpected :l gonna curious argumentation would post stays, source reuters, posts official data sources get deleted. 

Here's link breakdown numbers Sweden updates today Daily Discussion Post: impossible talk theater policies pandemic wolrdwide specifically Germany talk bit atleast.  
You right magic cinemas certain tools businesses have. 


You always able track many people cinema. looking reservations, controlling screening times letting people half hour movie starts. Paying required online per NFC phone debit card. Masks also mandated course.

The crucial part great ventilation cinema room itself.  
While open went cinema close me, one next big city another one cologne. freuqently visited. either luckiest man ever great preauction businesses actually works. 

Some businesses upgraded heavily ensure safety customers ""reward"" government closes keeps buildings like schools closed doen frequently due outbreaks open. sucks.

I know cinemas terrible job. honestly think done right higher risk catching covid cinema generally. 

Controversial take know. Besides one mentioned really accurate (as said cases can't tracked) think another study specifically cinemas. Herd immunity? Definitely. 

Vaccine natural infections both. next summer conservative point. Thank soo much info. Guess look forward summer :D, college starts late Jan guess still online courses. Maybe got data earlier Nice. Glad see India getting help Americaaaaaaaaaaaaa Fuck Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah  FFS, either numerically illiterate troll. presented comments fantastic insight reveals fundamental lack understanding.

What part ""the 55 crowd represented traffic deaths"" (which make small flat decrease numbers) understand?.
What part ""orders magnitude greater Covid"" understand?
What part small decrease swamped orders magnitude understand?

Your lack comprehension basic mathematics makes impossible sensible conversation. embarrassment education system country.

Goodbye good luck life. plenty Amazon. picked pack weeks back, figuring smart prep winter. get injury, sinus infection, etc wait packed ER hours want usual mask(s) keep car. chances COVID complications whilst young healthy close zero, realise that? I’ve heard I’ve also heard Clemson knowingly flown player tested positive, hard say what’s even truth. Emphesyma? 65? wouldn’t expect survive covid. emphesyma already slow inevitable death sentence lung damage. can’t see lungs coping covid damage top. mRNA human trials last years. vaccines effective seem myself, family friends anyone else half brain get vaccinated protected. people take fuck off. sinophobia, criticism recklessness. Stop yelling sinophobia everytime anybody criticizes anything. Dismissing legitimate concerns ""oh, sinophobia"" undermines argument well. A. problem CCP, whole country. B. said worked data given. even bare bones data Pfizer Moderna publishing. C. vaccine actually one concerning inactivated virus. mostly mimicking natural infection, still conflicting immunity data. mutation virus chose use, well, matters. used spreading Wuhan, may effective Italy mutation, vice versa. actually evidence support well antibodies reacted natural infectiobs. So, yes, vaccine particular want see trial data on. True False: you’re full excuses. 

Its far trip Trader Joe’s, far tested COVID? Solid priorities. know possible long term side effects vaccine? OK book. 100% population wanting access soon possible would lot trouble. much easier way. fsu opponent player test positive flight, thereby exposing team? study linked donations collected American Red Cross December 13, 2019 January 17, 2020

So samples first recorded case Wuhan 1st findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 may introduced United States prior January 19, 2020.

They're saying virus could originated USA.

Finally study even highly specific test, false positives may occur, particularly low prevalence areas

i.e. Antibodies tests inconclusive ever seen John Hopkins Covid Map? shows stuff ...yes? “Short” covid would happens average person gets this, vs long I’ve seen reported 5-20% people depending classify it. hate anecdotal evidence, relevant case, around 15 acquaintances covid knocked days recovered quickly lingering effects. would short covid. I'm argue whether case, thing gets infectious disease is, could US without outbreaks? December (or earlier, since that's antibodies found), take end January start showing community? Truly perplexing. theories (eg covid restrictions controlling population guise virus)

Suddenly I'm willing brush one off... Let great experiment begin. It’s less hour. 47 miles away. crazy. don’t know change behavior

Does make question view you?

They think stupid. live parents, healthcare workers. insistent brother girlfriend, live Canada, come home Christmas. live US. brother month girlfriend maybe week. persuade parents reconsider allowing visitors home time? extremely concerned going expose us virus yet parents pushing forward seen ""little boy"" almost year. 


I tried tell brother probably saying he's socially distancing since March worry way prove that. also roommates like throw dinner parties. know anything girlfriend might exposed even though parents insisted get tested twice, still feel insufficient need avoid travel time being. looked airbnbs financially impossible stay one almost month. 


Does anyone advice someone situation? Cool link! think they're saying time needed adequately review evidence already have, much enough evidence. zombies, nothing else comes mind really.  better safe dead sorry though? 

The first vaccines given 80+ year olds Real question: Jenny mccarthy say vaccine? I’ve seen 60 days in. Ain’t nothing grandma wants part of. 6 days post Thanksgiving. next week surely going worse. assume people states live small number counties. host EU government two factions citizens barely tolerate one another that's case decades. real. husband’s grandmother playing fire entire pandemic. got diagnosed leaky heart valve needs surgery now. two us mentally preparing bad news point. immunity

Sounds delicious Personally prefer Oxford vaccine it’s made using tried-and-tested traditional methods. Pfizer one uses technology never used people animals ever before. It’s mRNA vaccine, read them. anything new likely pop end month? Sorry catch-22. Internet hugs! (For it’s worth, can’t anything else.). Congratulations, best wishes baby. 

Glad hear Catholic Church sensible, hopefully churches get it. figure yet I’m vaccinated longer care covid? everyone get kidney stones life? People absolutely seething today actually crazier that.

They everyone get tested, allowed people either test negative antibodies.(Under assumption antibodies mean can't infect others).

So, attendees assured there's nothing worry everyone tested. children home since March 10th. furthest go yard. Easter, birthdays, Memorial day, birthdays, July 4th, Labor Day, birthdays, Halloween, Thanksgiving, another birthday (with mine tomorrow) spent household. 

Their mental health suffering. mental health suffering... stand, ready willing continue necessary pull this. 

WE fucking idiots. happened surrounded them. LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO forgive chiming in, I'm depressed we're seeing/learning many uncaring, unfeeling, selfish, sociopathic, murderous fucking assholes world truly care people die directly actions (that's 'murderous' earlier) *just want wear god damned mask.* Biden’s nothing. He’s playing dog Americans dying. It’s problem around either, I’d rather scientist declared over, population. Glad one say nothing happen! fun, late getting vaccination! Maybe kill arrogance well :) 8-9 months means basically halfway. 8-9 months. child’s entire life would spent stupid tier I’m done. childhood see world. I’m enraged people think losing year half lives that’s big deal. selfish. second needle arm, totally completely done. Sure things may closed, I’ll enjoying everything Open stop stressed. is, won’t fix issues made absolute gangbang. Yeah, defo least social distancing well next year. 

Ultimately want majority population vaccinated collectively hold “herd immunity”. means virus doesn’t fresh (“naive” “succeptible”) hosts infect, critically, circulate - chains infection get broken, virus cannot sustain population effectively. 

The point vaccination order that, given it’ll take months get everyone vaccinated, may well start vulnerable protect first avoid likely/serious harm. personal level, I’d* happiest get vaccine early I’m safe, things won’t go back new normal society wider population widely vaccinated.

Even I* don’t get vaccine later, vaccination everyone else still good news us - ppl get vaccinated gradually less less Covid swimming population, won’t safe you/I live normally, it’ll constantly getting less risky see ppl. I’ll still keep distance I’m vaccinated.

*I don’t expect get vaccinated early I’m old don’t risk factors, close family friends top list grateful vaccination coming soon! hopefully sometime soon next spring/summer. messaging 4 months [**2021-04-02 15:19:32 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-04-02%2015:19:32%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Studies shown opposite. former emo kid, take offense. non-conforming could be. non-conforming like me. Kids approved vaccine regime available testing 12 time. made daily learning schedule friend, hope start next week finally productive yep Wrong. I'm dick easy google search knowing developed safe, approved sars-1 vaccine. around yearssssss

Instead, searched vaccine development times. Nice. 

It. Was. Not. 8. Months. I'm wearing mask anywhere soon social pressure deems pandemic over. Unfortunately, article mention whether beyond-last overflow option swamped already: morgues undertakers. even mentioning death single word whole article, cannot bad there, right? I'm hoping conventions open. really doubt PAX East happens next year, usually scheduled end February beginning March, hope go least next year. appreciated public gatherings, think did.  Maybe know vaccine reduces transmission risk. may well far know data. 
It's always hard determine factors led decisions seems main issue risk staff associated risks system staff illness. Conversely vaccination brainer leaving people high risk expecting deal COVID sufferers unprotected route demoralisation. Akin sending troops battle without decent weapons etc flu vaccine recommended basically everyone US. saves millions dollars preventing missed worked hospitalizations well thousands lives. narrative concerned, reddit nuance. all. either 100% lockstep enemy must purged. grey area people. respond u/theboonies0203 point. hell. 

The Internet around now. Online learning ""thing"". Schools much, much along online learning. teaching 17 years worth damn, online versions lessons years ago. administrators suddenly thrust new system upon , that's them. several months prepare situation. new Covid would factor school started August, yet (most likely, like area) lazily signed Google Classroom called day. know teachers area (Texas) protesting current workload, blame 'em. that's administration school boards fault. know poor ventilation. Every school I've ever seemed normal rooms HVAC systems.

Teachers special anyone else. Many us every day public trying earn dollar. OP still stands. like current situation - quit go find another job. Like everybody else. is. 

*One last thing - always talk commenting Education America. think schools enough money complete core mission - take look districts budget. believe average district could cut administration HALF miss beat. Millions dollars water every year. money could go additional teachers, technology both. would nice follow story. mean many people plane got sick. perfect step right direction. 

I never agreed individual mandate affordable is. goes every year. 

This jumping opportunity institute universal healthcare critical. get plan implement many unemployed, many paying premiums insurance companies, hospitals facing billions charged medical debt, hospitals likely agree payment terms universal healthcare puts forth.

Insurance companies going nickel dime health professionals. still deductibles copays collect patients hospital never receive. financial climate charge ever.

Medical systems going lose money facing spending earn. bail out. Create universal healthcare plan, get passed, start negotiating. 

This time. doesn’t make sense without correlation mask wearing distancing. Staying home good advice spread within households contributor outbreak. understanding FDA somewhat unique review raw data clinical trials basically make report / analysis. countries generally use drug maker’s report starting point reduces amount time spent overall. resigned, have. Even ones ""care"" still teenager mindset happen them. Policies enforced work places. friends brother exposed, took rapid test two days exposed negative, wanted wait 7 days take PCR test accurate way find out. told place work (Target) told come in. whole thing frustrating hell. still think title goes fried chicken sandwich still really impressive. “Leaked” stfu... 6 months isn’t near imo doesn’t seem much one Governor Abbott refuses issue one and, along AG Paxton, tries limit ability Mayors County Judges issuing one. think still statewide mask mandate, get outside urban areas see lots people ignoring - urban areas follow 100%, seen plenty pictures swamped bar/restaurants full patrons without masks.  friends family aren’t stupid vaccinated I’m vaccinated.

Let rebuilding begin I'm wearing mask concert shit???? really becoming ashamed American.  Honestly, dangerously close “this way world accept it” mindset it’s even funny. news vaccine light end tunnel reinvigorated describe words US follow suit found good graph ICU + hospitalizations today : 

While ICU occupancy still less half spring, total hospitalizations actually 90% spring. Well, thirtysomething man, isn't. expect I'll eligible receive vaccine time in, like, 2022. Plus get everyone door working, commuting, traveling consuming again. Helps kickstart local economy. prevention only, would effect given infection already taken root. one study, people antibodies 7 days first dose, takes several weeks booster dose achieve maximum protection. dad go next day initial shot, probably give protection, goes second shot, maybe 70%-90% protection.  Every morning log work whether I've ""traveled region experiencing COVID outbreak"" perpetually annoyed I'm supposed put ""yes"" - Michigan lmao. know masks 100% effective, one said were, merely slow spread virus.

Would rather someone fart 6 feet away pants, pull pants 2 feet away fart directly face? cover nose mouth shirt something stinks?

You're strawmanning argument masks completely stop virus using smelling farts prove it. None argument anything people saying want people tonwear masks.

In fact 2 points said line say wear masks, able smell farts pants. Actually there’s woman town selling succulents. spring selling tomato plants, many flowers etc. take get going certainly pay off. Hey Canadian serious question here,

But Donald Trump widely blamed coronavirus spread US?

Here Canada nobody really blaming Justin Trudeau (or Prime Minister -- equivalent President). reason Federal government really say day day operations pandemic management a) purchasing securing medical supplies internationally i.e. masks; testing kits, b) border closures, c) well development government funded vaccines. also ability declare nation wide state emergency, never happened here. cases, Canada, much slower react US was, despite Trump's loose irresponsible rhetoric, still much faster react even though one tenth population US.

In Canada, find people blaming MPPs (our equivalent Governors), even mayors. makes sense actually say day day management pandemic ways matter. understanding US politics Governors even autonomy MPP Canada does, yet Canadian following US media, clear hear almost nothing responses Governors, Cuomo New York past spring, believe praised Trump's response assistance...

Regardless, explain Trump blamed outbreaks historically Democratic states, ran Democratic governors, cities ran left leaning mayors. Illinois example (which roughly population province Ontario), seeing something like 10-15x cases per day, boggles mind. understanding Illinois city Chicago Democratic hotspots. feel like numbers would attributed Trump though?

Anyway, find confusing. need museum covid.

It Zuck's interview. brought on. Sadly, right call.

I mean rude, right call **because** people like you. plenty resources go around, shortages people panic buying. probably dumb question, vaccine given stage infection cure it? purely preventative needs injected prior infection? latter, long effective protecting you? Eg, dad gets vaccine, safe go public next day? Fucking racist merpeople. Come, fellow ignorant Americans, must swarm gather turn Georgia Maine completely red. anyone really surprised? Watching news rest world, Americans aren’t allowed travel world right now. SARS-COV-2 coronavirus - coronaviruses rarely mutate, usually small mutations hamper vaccine campaign like this. Regardless party, none deserve reelection. trials rushed, evidence generated extremely fast pace.

Years vs weeks. Yeah completely stuck hardest nuts crack. Covid brand-new virus, could easy rabies hard HIV, think got lucky.

That's really true. Scientists used new type vaccines never used before. welcome first try come back year check symptoms. read article find out. one interviewing Fauci. flu vaccine mandatory. used mask option can't come work without flu vaccine Nope, reason given. I'm going presume licensing vaccines Lol. I’ll continue living life.

Kind stupid risk outbreak $10-40 per person. accelerate time takes test success rate cant test longterm side effects complications show later years testing rushed like this. play video games fair Canadians, I'd say half half, half perfectly fine people, half absolutely rude people Heaven forbid true? Everyone know it, that’s did. I’m confused work one Rochester, NY.

Give couple hours. hate living Brazil. even plan here.  Lol. see much subreddit. “Well I’m going tolerate spring”.... okay then....(??) looks like it’s everywhere except aren’t testing. Thank god there’s virus - wouldn’t even know since don’t test! also 1300 million people comparison, ok think. pretty much hoping people know overly pressured results/time. Working hospital fiancée likely going part first batch. Still better covid though even relatively unsafe vaccine (which hopefully isn't).  got results much faster doesnt mean arent side effects show effect longterm. u cant test u cant accelerate time. hard trust anything/anyone days.

But since unveiling preliminary results, AstraZeneca acknowledged key mistake vaccine dosage received study participants, adding questions whether vaccine’s apparently spectacular efficacy hold additional testing.

Scientists industry experts said error a series irregularities omissions in way AstraZeneca initially disclosed data eroded confidence reliability dont see anyone saying ""instantly"" going back normal. quoting anyone lol. stating obvious everyone want go back normal right away. mean, wrong saying that??! think dude, who's first thought summer plans, want go back normal right away?! constantly read Tegnell saying federal strategy protect people nursing homes. don’t recall articles responsibility region. thought response throughout Sweden much stake approved, longer scientific question, also politicial.

Which leads question: everyone sure approved, need formalities delay? great thing though - means risk immunised, hopefully young, healthy people able carry lives normality regardless whether they've vaccine yet. Certainly possible - would assumed would lot positive results case. act control I'm terrified rollercoasters oversized mice anyway. 🤷🏻‍♀️ dad takes care mentally disabled people state. Would considered ""healthcare"" ""essential""? want vaccinated. vaccine me. Screw off. Current evidence favor Oxford vaccine (yet).

I guess means months delay least. Free\*

*\*smart allocation taxes* Ouchie Stop bundling views agree one convenient pack oppose. mask orders, proven completely useless however get vaccine soon possible *despite condition normally discourages vaccination*. Yes, people oppose ""muh freedom"", otherwise equalling masks vaccines absurd. Less mandate mask hint. need 2 doses, really. even know herd immunity way go among rest population? it’s young people left, theoretically cause little damage. Full text: Britain start vaccinating people COVID-19 Pfizer vaccine next week country’s regulator approved jab Wednesday, health minister Matt Hancock said Wednesday.

“From early next week start programme vaccinating people COVID-19 country,” told Sky News, calling “fantastic news”. would've likely already approved US.
   
It would November 20 [that's announced meeting happening needs 3-week advance notice stuff Everyone goes nasopharyngeal swab PCR screen positive, antibody test done follow up. Capitalist America, rich eat *you!* wife Chinese government think that's true.

Given overpopulation happens already poor countries, already surplus 'slave labour' wage level people. Translation: wrong huge mistake. know hospitals one work at? EU bureaucratic mess Dread it... 
Run it... 
The vaccine still arrives... advised wear masks. fear masks would make people touch faces make people feel safe enough socially distance.

And clarify. never advised us wearing masks like liars sub claims. So

Much 

#WINNING Hallelujah!

Pfizer saved us all.

Now moving vaccine -70.C.
to prevent spoilage. course areas concern abbreviated AOC take account 2 doses each? 20m doses 10m people? mean, I've always back stiffness, since high school practically, think extraordinarily poor posture. 7 Nah, Egypt Sweden Brazil done once, power cut. Emergency tea still tea talking Aviptadil literally clinical trials right [and going phases like vaccines depends politicians fingers pie. 

For example, many prominent politicians bankrolled Pfizer rather competition would've likely already approved US.

Then there's question charge foots bill (us little people). Thank kind words! Stay safe take care. lol downvotes crack wonder, reason trial last one year? Meanwhile EU agency taking sweet time, proper paper pushing far important marginal annoyances like human lives.

I consider starting sending list people died day per country make cost stalling concrete. workload something could overcome. sad state affairs Sweden teachers, since already stretched thin, temps supposed cover stay home well longer possible teach kids still level deserve. Great question. 

You opt study time, forced vaccinated attend event likely choose dropping trial attending gotten different vaccine. asked trial coordinator this, way? able guide somewhat. I've got relative kidney transplant years ago they've told can't get current vaccines. getting hot here..  much ""ChInUhH ViRuS"" s/ son asthma, try explain people I'm worried us catching COVID-19 reduce risk. I'm worried happens son asthma attack rescue inhaler working there's ER take terrified seven-year-old to. happens if, find someplace take him, there's albuterol steroids already used COVID-19 patients? calm angry little airways down?

How many people suffer asthma need emergency care times year exact medications high demand virus? many car accident victims need anesthesiologists, pulmonologists, critical care nurses? many stroke victims need neurologists? many broken bones tumors need turn imaging machine?

At point going hospital guarantee going catch COVID-19?

A total collapse medical system one frightening things think of, especially burdened millions virus adding chronic illness rolls. Happy cake Day I'm screwed Nobody knows now. expectations. Lol they’ve announced phase 3 trials months ago, haven’t paying attention Surely definition normal? suspect soon deaths hospitalisation numbers go due 50s vulnerable vaccinated, government majority public largely get back normal.  Plus vaccine far harder travel distribute. Oxford one mass roll vaccine Texas here. Fucking sucks. Hopefully. think need bit data Oxford though. mean...are surprised? telling people back March saved numerous lives. Thank you. Buy pulse oximeter. (Small gadget clips finger). numbers settle put way onto finger, write oxygen level least day. Ideally 99, 98 lowest.  Call hospital drops 90, find oxygen level they’re taking patients. hospitals aren’t overwhelmed area, go 90 lower.  Stop rest it’s 97 home.  

Don’t let go 80, that’s actively dying territory. 

Below 97 bit worrying, unexpected covid. Based what? Say like China, government seriously get shit done. Despite first country hit pandemic, managed contain (with pretty Draconian measures) basically wipe virus entirely.

A colleague mine went Shanghai recently reported life basically normal, concerns distancing wearing masks. 

Multiple countries demonstrated possible contain eliminate Covid without vaccine. Allowing people continue die choice. Canadian culture 😆 Cool story bro. happens, I'm married 1 too. least spouse understands COVID takes seriously (but think Trump best anyone could stopping COVID.) experts authority ground air travel? Remember substantial meal (i.e. scotch egg, pork scratchings) every beer Shouldnt biggest news since March? yet post sits hundred upvotes. sub really renamed r/currentUSAaffairs.... certainly inhale virus mask, even support everyone wearing masks assume eliminate risk inhaling viral particles. professional contexts smell test fact used qualitative assessment respirator (N95) fit:

There’s light end tunnel! context work someone come made wear mask (it’s mandated state).  course 2 hours interacted sat total 35 people throughout visit (different work cohorts). wore mask except one group 6 people.  sat across (sort distanced) eachother like others meeting coffee pastries (which kind weren’t supposed group context did) took masks think 20-30 minutes. 

2 days later called said sick lost smell.  tested positive Covid day rapid test. notifying everyone quarantine 4 got sick. ones coffee pastries.  One hospitalized eventually recovered 2 weeks hospital another week supplemental oxygen. I'm bracing actually beat covid all, former president tries take credit somehow... Hmm yes floor made floor Death rate 0.1-0.2%. won’t lose lot residents COVID. Safety quality main issue here. Regulations restricting work good case. least woud like end ineffective vaccine radioactive polonium system [Then shity vaccines Thank sanity service. share please fragrant teas benefit little milk commonly drank. Yes, still drink hot tea hot day. one forcing though!

It's entirely normal sugar too. close eyes it. bashed everybody personally too. 

But swedish way. Superiority complex followed victim complex. Technical question, US-Canada border closed there’s COVID outbreak say, Mozambique?

Only USA, Canada, Central America (incl. Mexico), Western Europe numbers matter. able stop wearing masks get vaccinated. posted link study another comment Google critical oxygen levels find lot studies suggesting medical field increase hospital admission cut 90 percent 92 percent oxygen levels would likely save lives. Feels bit surreal I'm diabetic, issues involve stiffness. bad days, bending joint (knee, elbow, back, whatever) takes effort uncomfortable painful. know old people groan move? Stiffness. weather fluctuations past couple weeks, I've loud AF getting laying sitting position. recognize happens. made laugh, cheers. Teared-up little. first many announcements come.

It's amazing possibility vaccine all, let alone one 50% effective.

This going save many lives. wrong people like you? right conspiracy nutjobs? standardized testing science skills anymore? Foxnews bashing head w nonsense daily? Sheesh first mRNA vaccine Vegas Golden Knights history. laws place allow it, whether agree laws opinion source? Oxford soon hopefully? Yes Hungary wants use it, able to? headline actually pretty extreme though. Personally speaking, I'm fond vaccine's seem earliest available right make use mRNA mechanism (with moderna pfizer news frequently). believe scientists people created it, personal scale I'd actually rather take wait inactivated vaccine. Back pub lads difference March now, March large cities (like NYC) inundated COVID cases, could move patients nearby hospitals state. 


Now, entire country inundated COVID patients. nearby hospitals move patients to. Canada Mexico sure going take COVID patients (or even non-COVID patients.) 


The reason rebuilding temporary hospitals, nurses doctors staff them. temporary hospitals built March, staffed nurses doctors around country, country inundated COVID. Now, spare nurses doctors, working, entire country inundated COVID patients. 


None hard understand, quite logical easy see. people thread said, people like refuse see it, want inconvenience anyway, regardless 2000 people dying COVID alone, day. seem qualified answer question (or least qualified enough direct right direction answer). 

I currently heavily contemplating participate trial starts two weeks; told intended duration trial one year, i.e., would know whether got vaccine end 2021 unless ended beforehand (which might happen). would happen events (e.g., conferences) require vaccinated order participate? Would make exception people participating study? realize probably know would handled currently, maybe precedent trials could give honest opinion would handled. me, even risk covid vaccine non-zero, still safer covid itself. one reported posts, thank — cleared reposts defined per Rule 3. COVID-19 contracted eyes, nose, mouth, means follow vegan diet likely contract virus non-vegans, according Vegan Friendly. point? Vegans wear masks social distance, too! Work. I’m hospitals ambulances daily. solution open up. 

Get people mental help need without breaking bank breaking social distancing. still get hungry, can't feel anything! Tails? Same, hate restrictions  Like CVS Amazon one may cheap. one use work us sat probe cable cost $600 attached $30,000 lifepak 15 monitor, even may need time catch reading. Switching fingers helps to. access pedi probe, put ear lobe. Lol can't imagine wreckage done nothing like Florida has. would see hospital collapse (which far from) springtime New York numbers would happen short order. models show saved 60,000 lives. 

We also avoided second wave. sure Clatsop County drive Astoria. Call 503-325-8500 Hahaha actually made account thought wanted cardiology. again, I’d name mine ALI (acute lung injury). get regularly. First one thought going die. next one got stuck, surgery recovery stent pee hole worse kidney.

I've several since then, recognize pain signs, let business unless gets bad. pass within days usually. know, that’s scary it, also it’s dangerously easy wave off. Getting Covid ranges symptoms death. you’re young/healthy doesn’t even necessarily guarantee you’ll completely fine. CDC recently estimated actual amount infected 8 times currently reported. puts around 33% guess? yes, think immunity first dose, nearly strong second dose. way COVID.... solution deal virus though. 

The actual solution make sure extended behavioral health covered insurance plans, affordable, socially distanced pandemic.   American bat shit insane. Please send help. Teeny tiny fat bubbles. taking many smart people dumb ones feel like EMS get priority vaccinations despite possibly highest risk sector infection right now... God hate fucking field sometimes. Imo, can't say much point time. people it, still antibodies. forget tax returns guys Canada chance? Tell organize Million Granny March Bill Gates mansion. Sit back watch fun. going screw vaccine distribution too. lied you, unless he’s enrolled trial. Seriously think media best interests mind? big pharma Ames millions sick people wants keep healthy? grand scheme things, thinking. Except many people irresponsibly spreading it, surviving. be, sounds like trying say taking seriously people that's deeply flawed conclusion. regret end r/leapoardsatemyface. regret make connection, sadly. disagree - think saying “right” thing opposite hypocritical way worse damage morale someone going grain say. surprises one, CDC suggest second phase vaccine rollouts? 65+ essential workers both? don’t care, dumb, won’t listen. 42% willing, fuck I’m surrounded complete idiots apparently. thoughts you. Covid ripped fire department. scary remember treatments much better beginning. Please isolate stress unless start difficulty breathing.

As suggested, O2 meter great idea. Politians scumbags!  know can’t get tested county even symptoms unless deaths door

Depends place guess.

I got tested mild flu-like symptoms. Fairly quickly too. Luckily test negative. live San Francisco Bay Area. I've struggling badly find work year one IT/data related offer I've company wanted move US although could sometimes work US home 1-2 times week 3 months - supposed 4 month contract. Obviously turned seeing US infection rate going. give good enough reason working remotely full time regardless was. still fully understand US bad. Seeing large gathering parties UK depressing mind boggling numbers nothing compared US. understand Canada, US nation filled 47% idiots Impeachment need crime prosecuted. entire purpose impeachment rid politicians fundamentally failed people. created politicians control laws therefore could easily craft nice crime syndicate violate statute.

Literally killing tens thousands citizens impeachable legislature people demand it. Better shorter protocol people follow longer one people ignore. 

People became symptomatic first 7-8 days likely severe symptoms, people develop severe symptoms likely infectious, even pre-symptomatic period, according several studies. afford enforce it, longer quarantine safer. Beijing changed quarantine period 28 days summer effort capture last 5% cases, know still that. active ingredient? 

Benzocaine Everyone kept asking hearing stuff.  Umm, BBC?  NPR?  New York Times?  Reuters?  realized people don’t even read USA Today. know someone works Rockwall. Says it’s like nothing changed. People parties time, restaurants stay packed. I’m surprised all. Rich conservatives don’t give fuck anyone Rockwall full snootiest motherfuckers I’ve ever displeasure around. couldn’t care less ever passed again. Quite possibly referred ways different times. man chronic diarrhea mouth. Exactly. said thing friends night mouthing COVID “that” bad playing games online. People don’t think illnesses can’t get treated helped. lot people continue dying COVID people also begin dying illnesses didn’t die from. Ohio announced can’t pay vaccines going work? 

I suspect they’re state struggling right either. know smart people said won’t get vaccine right away. understand risk, don’t understand lack risk. mean is, people well aware latent effects prescription drugs need long term safety data those. considering vaccines completely different. Vaccine safety track record fantastic needs be. giving something healthy people prevent illness. treating illness drugs. 

They aren’t considering reasons vaccines able come emergency approval review quickly. biggest speed increase simply fact pandemic. normal vaccine usually something common. So, take years placebo group get enough infections efficacy determined. pandemic, problem. Within months already enough data. virus everywhere. 

ADE would main concern latent effect. seen vaccine Dengue virus, believe. don’t know, it’s effect poorly made antibody actually enhances viruses entry cell instead neutralizing virus. something also would seen phase 3 trials pandemic. Plenty people vaccinated group surely come contact virus. Especially US control group give saline. Therefore received actual vaccine would known due immune system response causing fatigue and/or fever. would likely less diligent reasonably sure vaccinated. 

Sorry long post. I’m right assumptions people’s concerns, I’m sure easy fix unless people willing research own. Although human nature would probably people getting vaccine know others got it. Call chat phone (not covid, unless friend directs conversation situation).  nothing like human company make someone feel better.  (Even introverts get rest afterwards). covid ward nurses take vitamin d? Since May, U.S 2nd Denmark number tests per capita: right, wanted America could hell alot more, lets pretend like nothing unconstitutional help demographic suffering disease? They're singling older people first too. obese clear underlying medical conditions. unconstitutional too? No, isn't.

It's best path mitigating threat quickly possible. would rather lottery let everyone fair chance? let pandemic sprawl another year more. headline. anti-maskers use justify actions decisions. Good job, morons. patients’ lives? [""It'll gone I'll listen since seem big heart literally deciding vote shut outdoor dining, saying dangerous. soon (which major ramifications people hospitality business) rushes eat outside. don’t see outrageous? don’t care still allowed - position reason longer is. Pfffft, cares!? stock market hit 30k!, woooooo!!!!

Fuck, fucked. Suspended license one bad decision? really seems divide among churches. know strictest places since beginning. Others seem believe mask borderline satanic. roommate gave covid, never symptoms really sick, time got upset didn’t want go grocery store told thought “mean” wanting go infect people. Thoughts prayers US's second incursion Covid :'( Thanks insight. pandemic probably time this. Again, assuming average American capable manner 'reasonable'.

I define refusal wear mask reasonable. seems foolish self-defeating, yet strong core America feel right will.

The end.

They care think additional health burden they're introducing directly, not, choices. place priority indirect effects way choose live life.

We're likely change other's mind this. saying hospital bed utilization even lower says? so, much approx?

* Inpatient Beds Occupied (All Patients) 484,736 68.02% 
* Inpatient Beds Occupied (COVID-19 Patients) 97,203 13.64%
* ICU Beds Occupied (All Patients) 63,405 59.57% Fine. I'll use bath tub waffle stomp drain. /s restrictions worth mental health crisis creating. Open Now!!! almost died Feb 16 2020. even know normal blood pressure reading checked ER, buried healthiest healthy marathon running mother 3 days later sudden heart attack. (Family friend wife) lead normal lives, statistics. happening &amp; could you. 

I think going victim either. begging stay alive whatever there... give masks them. leave sanitizer porch, car, mailbox... 
Not me. them. you. 

I want see begging life. you. Ya know think people you’re speaking think it’s bad spend lot time it. don’t think know deep goes algorithms affect mass political movements elections. big data threat many ways. *how* spreads dangerous misleading info. mean, tip iceberg move. sum up, person know fucking moron. Especially hospital's empty beginning this. resting level patients various needs. There's always going amount accidents heart attacks cared for. like hospitals made able handle huge influx patients would massive waste money time. It’s good information concerned government information leaked often well??? Minnesota know Willmar New Ulm max capacity! Probs cities Duluth un sure those. Well unfortunately average going way up. Last 24 hours averaged 1.8 deaths minute. “Rules thee me.” nail polish also affect reading, cold hands.

That's important know, I've already, could help people panic oximeter shows weird values. Mine often takes ages show results, often also start really low O2 go 98 within seconds. forget DC wants state issue middle lower income workers make tax revenue fleeing cities much cheaper better opportunities. Many cities borrowed future income longer comes in. Cities back spring almost none have. city Chicago expected 2 billion dollar shortfall next yr. What’s fauci’s cock balls taste like? Pizza? far three examples leaders leading example

I think far 3. claim exhaustive list, make quick one memory:

The Governor New York's thanksgiving plans

The mayor Denver's plans

The Governor California's dinner

The mayor SF's dinner

The LA City Councilwoman's dining excursion

The DC Mayor's refusal quarantine per rules traveling

Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's extra hair salon visit

Chicago Mayour Lori Lightfoot's hair salon visit

The Philadelphia mayor eating Baltimore restaurant city's people allowed to

I also cannot even begin count number mayors, governors, representatives officials participated sanctioned various protests summer violated nearly every coronavirus restriction book. guess tip certainly conclude 3 examples taking virus seriously.

That's conclusion I'm drawing. conclusion I'm drawing people charge managing pandemic take virus seriously. Yes no. need front line workers. want risk losing due covid god forbid dying long term complications. necessary staff (remember set makeshift hospitals, still would still need staff it), would never worried flattening curve. main issue always healthcare... beds need staff need. shortage many died home italy. turn people away. virus quickly becoming miniscule comparison mental health crisis restrictions creating  Nothing Population Density?  Good. avoid stores going general husband can't avoid intubating covid patients like every shift now. getting vaccine luck runs would nice. That’s awesome her. 97 year old great grandmother hasn’t allowed room assisted living month now. socializing she’s allowed eating dinner doorway. she’s entirely alone. cancer doctors won’t treat, simply treatment alone would kill her. wife used take dinner twice week. haven’t physically able see since March. It’s heart breaking. Seriously, search corona USA Google provides interactive graphs maps shows bad situation Maybe, dumb people outbreeding smart people long suppose. fascinating study history look back badly USA fucked up. 
There many books written shows made this. 
All things lead it, bad decisions during, push back morons fight supposed rights instead caring fellow countrymen. Women cannot take Flomax unless confirmed serum pregnancy tested negative recall it'll number fetus' genitals supposedly helps. 

You might need lithotripsy pass it; tears areas invite nephritis trust want Well worldwide hoax make trump look bad. /s here! walking...right pothole. 

It got cold snowy today really achey. Moreso weeks!

Hope healing well! Nurse (RN BSN). confirm /u/cardiomegaly 's /u/Meverseyou 's advice correct. fingers warm, COPD, less 90% SpO2? Definitely get seen asap. jealous! I've always wanted move Canada I'm afraid ship sailed me😔 ya mind asking, city move to? happens guessing. This. 

Today Dec 1 Plaguemas Eve, average Thanksgiving feaster begin show symptoms tomorrow. 

The disaster baked-in already...the waiter bringing kitchen now... Smoking causes emphysema people end oxygen, ER struggling breathe. sister died emphysema, uncle died chronic rejection lung transplant due emphysema smoking. Like said example see stretch? 

Does make easier see example cognitive dissonance? smoked til shortly died. think would kill them.

People today COVID denial situation acting virus kill spite scientific evidence contrary. wondering? already know suppression place since March. stay place January. 20%, that’s month ago: herd immunity coming sooner going yourself, understand. used make fun others going tough mental challenges became empathetic went myself. Social interaction core makes us human point whole system language evolved. restrictions continue, virus pandemic pale comparison mental health crisis occur, already japan suicides begun outpace deaths coronavirus. Lol sure actually high risk. Yes. bare minimum people can't manage it. absolutely false. Hospitals US businesses whether non-profit. profit building empty rooms hiring extra staff, don't. Traveling nurses pick slack there's enough need justify expense. train prepare multi casualty events temporary accommodations made staff pick extra shifts...

But pandemic that's going 9th month unchecked exponential growth staff finished 12 weeks extra shifts two months ago? No.

We fine. Reveals? though already know Exactly. I’m depressed cause restrictions. I’m depressed can’t go anywhere anything without fear getting family sick. depressed finally finished PhD can’t get job economy ravaged b/c virus control didn’t enough stop it. ☹ Lol ok. Tell people died flu cause people masked up. 

I get coming from. hope too. Would rather Chinese government operated like trump adminstration did, bring neurosurgeon tell everyone virus serious, scientific evidence, personal opinion. 

The doctors discussing incoming epidemic private chat groups, leaked. doctors right discuss speculate private, punished for, government cannot make official health policies without scientific evidence. Nursing homes residents make bulk deaths, hospitalizations. majority sort DNR do-not-transfer-to-hospital order. vaccinating first value human life, trying conserve hospital resources. Japan lock kept total deaths close U.S.A's daily death count. cases situations people something dumb like taking mask inside restaurant; going bar; going big event without mask; friends constantly without masks. reason cases high U.S. people fucking selfish, know hard admit wrong are. U.S. could never locked 10k deaths people selfish assholes, that's truth. Economic relief little fighting virus.

The reality is, there's meaningful difference strategy Trump employed plan Biden talking about. They're plan. President make one bit difference (unless President forces government stop dragging feet vaccine ship it.) vaccine literally help point. Hah gay Western government care.... see death number. refuse admit wrong doing. refuse provide real help. would rather kill 100k people lose profits even though taking people. Outside money giving money let economy stay open. 

Only necks chopping board move little fingers. responsibility fact done little years 6 figure incomes stability know means represent people.  

There real change last 4 decades. know real crisis matters still raking money. Leaked? big secret. US obviously one giant covid dumpster fire. god one sending plagues? yall dumb hell look worldometers times day look individual states. states nearly exponential now. 

My coworkers calling sick getting tested want short paycheck. does, I'm limited session length (which adjustable 5 15 minutes. whatever session length take, none fits smoking habits. hit joint 3 4 times give rest half hour. want another hit, light again.

It even take long reach temperature (70, 80secs), urge, alone want, :)... watching hashtags Twitter. Scientists trying figure R value, mortality rate, incubation period, etc. really became concerned China built 1000 bed hospital 10 days. started making list items slowly stock on. knew going get serious. know quickly. Went ER, got Tylenol Codeine 14 days. Flowmax. ran 3 days ago passed yet. larger one 5 number forgot size. Might well bus covered razor wire dipped salt. 

And yes, I'm enjoying owning penis time. Hippocratic Oath symbolic/traditional, actually legally binding links November last year? absolute earliest articles find last day 2019, even Wikipedia none form time. No, reasonable access risk. Based DeSantis crashing plane survivors thinking probably influenza-like illnesses categorized influenza - understanding that's pretty common. also surprised intentional, say.

But order get kinds numbers (20x), that's *a ton* cases. obviously see symptomatic cases, likely mild ones, beginning. still begs question - Wuhan come seroprevalence ~5%? r/nottheonion Phew that's relief! figured they'd done something useless....like mask mandate stay home order, certainly make things better!!!


🙄🙄🙄🙄 Good luck sure vaccines work. Mitch McConnell trying make business meals tax deductible lmao. Okay. Funny thing Sweden admitted messed quarantining would much better. trump needs made example  J &amp; J single shot.

The logistics might make one winner mid long term. number reasons. thought sarcastic read second paragraph. Yes, yes careful. virus doesn’t care anything except virus. But, important mentally healthy. Perhaps, Zoom therapy. CBD works anxiety. Best luck you. fucking fallacy all. I'm strictly commenting OP's comment ""Your rights end well-being begins."" That's simple statement applies anyone getting someone sick, not? I'm speaking general sense; one right get another person sick, OP said, ethos apply universally? seems pretty simple, no? applies now? it? correct have. Sudden large drop. We're asking people stay 6 feet away wear masks

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
That's bare minimum ask totality evidence matters it’s strong.

So ambiguous denials work? Again, put shut up. wanted post image, thought article good too. like call ""leaked government map"" COVID data publicly available since beginning pandemic. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think make huge problem realm hospitals. still mask follow precautions.

But importantly...they still test. gotta come back negative every time go work.

If this, COVID spread doctors/nurses patients minimal. is, bigger concern patients nurses. change that.

But it'll save lives health care workers. it’s 14 months live long time. median time death full time care facility something like 6 weeks.  

Surely vaccine would better “spent” elsewhere.   /r/nottheonion get healthcare, can't hospitals overwhelmed. dense, rest world looking shock people like causes fellow citizens die. Agreed drop like 98% 91% bad.

Also make sure warm hands. I'd fine finally able see family summer. agree healthcare needs change, many ways. national shame. remember months ago president said “its embers put fast” lol pushing minimizing it? see results thanksgiving matter. It’s going get worse. Fauci say mass vaccinations would probably April, maybe 2021! Oh yea, defenitely. base help either. definitely like following election now. suck mental health important general health change fact responsible people wearing mask public, 

So politicians doctors wear masks? irresponsible, still working important jobs heavy responsibilities? demanding resign. we? Yeah, government speaking us obvious, serious crisis facing marshaling resolve patriotism fight it. Sadly, think late get control even Biden finally gets take reins! Sleeve already rolled let’s go There’s evidence restrictions what’s starting mental health crisis. Millions lived better months CARES act passed.  Boohoo! I’m sad lonely I’m living “my best life ever” 1 year, 90+ years may live for. 

People perspective grit. silent generation rolling graves. 

There true mental health issues, entitled, selfish, shallow people. I’m expecting Liberals lose next general election quite badly... national debt losing control... High end estimates 500,000 deaths worldwide flu compared tens millions would die without social distancing COVID-19. apples oranges comparison classic example slippery slope logical fallacy. long keep border around Cathy Meng extra secure make fence electric care. Absolutely. every bit much heroes ordeal medical personnel. It’s time start treating such. contend brother healthy enough could survived normal virus. Would really matter him? want reference, Mike prime, chewing ears. thats F  Better break ole sharpie. No, already multiple people pfizer vaccine vaccine way 3 weeks, fact lot people study vaccine 4 months started July 27th. We're number 1!

Who killing?!

Everybody!

EDIT; Lost grandma one uncle's/cousins.

Life sucks, deal it. sure Albertans? thought would easy way out. wrong shitloads people continue die laziness. nyc both? deaths world They’re able live seclusion compounds every external need taken care others. doubt they’d care much either way. Covid “poors” far they’re concerned. Japan lockdown all, simply relied masks kept deaths minimum. I'm sure masks perfect seem pretty fucking effective people actually use right way. 

Sorry amp link, mobile know deal Stopping mental health crisis worth deaths like these, coming person adhd anxiety. Hard mad this. dining doors limit number people. 

Both rule time. Thats important context want lobb ""rules thee..."" people. 

The governor's worse. God damn that’s good graph funny remember lot night clubs Quebec whole lot ""values"" appreciated locals. 


It's also funny I've Canada 3 times life always enjoyed met really friendly people. Whenever comes always really pleasant things say memories I've made there, culture, etc. 


So sounds like xenophobia think get away online low hanging fruit insult Americans. Hold on. contagious deadly, still contagious deadly. Want tell families 650,000 people year die flu that? People would still loved ones people masked instead ""freedumbs"" breathe mask less. many people died, lot people still fucking died. lives less important. OP said ""your rights end well-being begins."" applies everyone, whether they're pandemic not. goal would change mind half folks start. would help lot may make vaccine actually work people get etc. 182k bad sure sign things getting worse? I'm sure. 1 week ago 177k catch effect Thanksgiving. even 5k cases normally would recorded Thursday - Sunday improvement week week Thursday - Sunday 5k week week.  Hi, already knew that.

- Canada Ohhh. Ya that's probably case. Said daycare totally gave guys it. Half Florida: RON DESANTIS GOOD JOB, NUMBERS DOWN! Apparently nothing great strategy  Even shitty anti-masker known Covid sick, sound like meets criteria require quarantine (15 min &lt; 6 feet). CDC guidelines here: Duh? documented receiving what, believe don’t check trials influence trials way. Like researchers aren’t checking group got one trial goes on. they’re trying see clear enough tell group got vaccine without knowing got what. helps see vaccine actually working tell group got vaccine without knowing. trial unblind go data  Y'all wrong going away easter, election, still using line logic. realize fed spoonful lard? Project Warp Speed cool ass name, naysayers dammed. Still NOTHING. Hot zone? way health care worker. true Yeah. That’s also lot people dying get virus shreds lung tissue glassy scars.  sheep better iq whatever He'll blaming covid Biden day one presidency. ""why biden asleep wheel?!""

Also blame deficit him. wait one day magically disappear it’s all. like problems life, I’m sure go away without effort work agree. Like Pelosi Newsom, elected officials suffering well deserve small breaks. Yeah, maybe it'll ~200 deaths per day. *tragedy*.

/s Tested positive today. Luckily seem minor symptoms, hope don’t get worse. It’s currently minor fever lightly congested nose (though always congested time year due dry cold allergies). EXHAUSTED. slept 12 hours yesterday.  covid lies ocean,

And covid comes back home meeee Yeah absolute worst possible time let collective guard reality UCC CoC different things. super surprised reading first CoC one worst offenders. Oh know that. great news. Thanks. I'm idiot thinking article might substance. Here's why. Well one going expected charge citizens estimated $3000 per person vaccine. anyone tell country again.  start vomiting uncontrollably, that’s need medical support. fluids nothing else. deeper pandemic human condition:

No empathy, lot apathy. diabetic amputations take health seriously. title fear porn. like, Belgium countries _worse_ US help Biden somehow?

Or guess people believe rest world exist, god knows set foot outside US. Going thin population Midwest. First off, that’s false. Second off, percent doesn’t matter. hundreds thousands lives lost tragedy. 

And it’s bad.. lockdowns place. Imagine would like places didn’t try hard keep people happy. 

Actually, know would look like. It’s happening south Midwest speak. [Always I'm right middle medical training super disheartening see around (though stake what's happening right now). I'm interested see applications medical school decline students want deal something like happens  going 35,000 deaths short last years average? Well fucking smartass got technical high horse technical distinction HIV AIDS. ROLL TIDE! people age 50 start getting vaccinated, give demographic herd immunity

By definition, demographic won’t herd immunity long they’re living among rest “herd” non-immune people. it’s good we’re vaccinating risk people first, people risk less functional immune systems. they’re less likely protected vaccine. 

It’s great there’s light end tunnel, need keep expectations realistic. don’t want another situation like people outraged wasn’t “two week shut flatten curve”. Paywall Illinois avoid second wave all. one worst country. CHINA plan working..only American Tards would get defeated way!! guy hangs corner 6,the main results blinded know going either way.

Am understanding right? assumed blinded study meant participants didn’t know given vaccine placebo. always assumed administrator data scientist master list detailed got vaccine versus placebo got sick. LOL, article 3 months, ""why can't comprehend 1,000,000 deaths Herd stupidity going kill us all. going say, Canadian description describes everyone know midwest US. obnoxious ones florida, Massachusetts, RI, Connecticut, Ny, dc, maryland, Delaware, Jersey, California.

Boris Johnson conservative. USA conservatives anymore, plutocrat funded death cult. Rationing care already happening states unfortunately. would wager 50%+ beds full right we'll top 75%+ new year. Luckily vaccine probably start putting brakes that, although probably minimal general public starts receiving it. time Biden takes office, vaccination program already well way. I’d personally surprised death rate hasn’t fallen significantly end February. (As long people actually take vaccine don’t refuse “reasons”) fake news Vaccine? read it. really explain unless miss something.

But course going side effects like 10% take it... Distrust expected.

That’s way US media portrayed anything Republican related. let virus ""wash over"" God.  Hell I'd fit well there, love/play hockey, love poutine, enjoy Montreal smoked meat sandwiches, letterkenny trailer park boys favorite shows, I'm already used cold snow! 😅 Yep. laptop obviously migrant caravan 2020. Id first like advise thorough research area did. spent good amount time vacation, never realized weather actually like live here. lived Portland decade never knew winter gloomy seasonal depression til moved last year. really meant “rainy PNW” rains 3 times amount Portland. barely made winter plans survive winter included spending lot time stuff home. that’s squashed. also lost power 3 times first month bought house LOL, know it’s regular damn occurrence. figured something house came whole home generator system (but don’t generator yet, system $$$ part anyways) 

Anyways bought house Portland sold huge profit years later. paid student loans, took 7 month traveling trip(work remote) enoug left downpayment. got really F-ing lucky there. husband normally makes six figure income able work remote 3 years. house got, well watched market religiously paid $259k 3/2. That’s like, rock bottom pricing area, don’t think I’ve seen another house hit market within 40k sense. another lucky shot. owner divorced updating/remodeling it’s terrible fixer(so last house) although sometimes want cry horribly arranged kitchen audacity pull full cabinets make open shelving, try remember plan live rest lives (we always wanted retire here, also engaged 12 min house) time fix ugly. 

We moved particular spot school district community. It’s absolutely phenomenal. Damn it’s hard make winter though.

When first moved lived RV Rockaway RV Park. $500 month space rent that’s average county. 100% recommend living RV. miss neighbors sooo much (we 20ish min north traffic weather day) lot people live RV parks coast, one, besides walk across road beach, soooo nice. lived couple months found house, wasn’t listed since FSBO. went around town asking anyone knew owners couldn’t get hold ad saw. FSBO’d Portland home, didn’t scare us off. 

I move Cousin quickly made lots girlfriends sort lived (for 44 year old man, less lol) recently found nice apartment Astoria economical price. also got hired make $37 hour CDL. 
There actually lot decent paying jobs here, lot affordable housing. make twice Portland here, husband couldn’t find job making anywhere near pay. 

Tillamook Seaside affordable housing options, people compete jobs, even McDonald’s Seaside pays $15 hour start. get 2 bedroom apartment Tillamook $900. also houses Seaside hit right around 200k. wanted live smaaaaallll town, live one three villages. /r/holup appreciate response! felt way anxiety getting haha!

There's always multiple predictions. hitting worst case scenario low bar success.


There's countries managed save lives economies. quit LTAC unit 0 plans navigate joblessness back October. literally going throw building didn’t. Talk fear mongering lmfao fucking theocrat [How accurate laboratory tests used diagnose positive result almost always true, negative result sometimes false. Flatten curve Nergal found wanting. didn’t - asshole left subway system wide open early stages. Pathetic Sure, thought vaccine base tested long time severe adverse effects vaccines historically happen immediately within months. 

I thought biggest issue effectiveness. 

I could wrong tho, virus-ologist play one reddit TV. everyone lives US dipshit Good fucking luck reading article mobile device Jesus fucking Christ Well ""they"" hiding numbers. ""we"" hiding numbers well shitty. like defend either government shady shit. Great timing username! Nobody ordered stop, nothing illegal it. Yeah positivity rate 45% yesterday’s tests. Green zone. Yes, i'm sure completely quarantined whole pandemic - would explain give anyone else, even pre-symptomatic know contagious yet. /s

But seriously, people situations could get virus, virus, likely situations could spread virus. fact 70% indicates likely spread others. I'm sure part based behavior, seems significant enough stat completely based behavior alone, also factors make less predisposed spread virus. Humans will, might not. Chance death still low.... 320 million people times numbers causes issues.

Hospitalization rate 0.05% 18-49. said 0.05% hospitalization rate still ~6 million people age group break healthcare industry.

Numbers low enough average person can't really perceive issue daily life many infected system collapses.

The EU whole worse US death rates quickly catching up. recent spike cases slowing results. 3 tests come back 2 days past months one last week (that actually needed results quickly for) took 4 days. boot taste? wife teacher cancer patient know high priority list one way another. 

But able get vaccine (am tied member household) wait place priority list receive vaccine? Wuhan surrounding cities? 2019, early 2020? CNN article also mentions placed additional strain healthcare system, indicating actual increased prevalence disease, increased confirmed cases. I'd curious read actual documents, think method determining 20x cases extremely relevant (actual flu tests vs ILI recorded), see available. wearing mask social distancing? honest now. People sniffles don’t end hospitalized, asshole. Probably time this, but: They’re boomer parents decided quarantine move husband since I’m due give birth day. Never planned living multi generational home think it’s going benefit us long run. US petri dish. ""Turned corner"" New Englanders desperately barricading doors droves infected heading north looks like. covid rules work Agree $1800 fine would excessive, case.

Disagree simply encourage people keep horrible, dangerous virus spreading - would happy see non-maskers get cracked head billy club. feel months leading inevitable scenario like situation NY March across nation. Months months common sense mask wearing, choice place go, vigorous hand washing/hand sanitizing, etc. I’ve occasional urge want stuff pre-February (movies, mall, friends, etc.), case count numbers, hospital stories, virtually governmental leadership tippity top helped quell them.

News upcoming vaccine nice, person like months months away feel, sense wonder good thing keep usual pace social behavior pandemic. process needle hitting arm, person administering vaccine probably already one, health care workers nationally, grocery store clerks, hopefully vulnerable, good portion public.

Hopefully year now, life somewhat like life protections flu let us carefree. Perhaps carefree-ness common place 2-3 years line. Perhaps years progress, method used vaccine changes one flu others, able fight new coronaviruses help make vaccines quicker, etc. 

I truly hope nationally learn plans place hospitals never overload plans use do. I’m sure hinge devastating new pandemic time. question I’d expect 10 year old ask me. assume it, self isolate, warn anyone touch with. Testing everyone time impractical, help anyway. Limit contact, isolate sick.

Here's source. Come back one point, compare Oh? Well I’m still seeing 269K total deaths google. Yesterday 268K. god wills That’s awful. keep hearing triage happen feel like isn’t covered. isn’t news covering. lot moderate, normal people seem hesitant.

there many cases fda approved medications taken market sometimes serious fatal side effects, concerns taking brand new drug drug potentially rushed immediately addressed drug simply fda approved. look side effects numbers serious injury death caused medications, numbers generally much less serious numbers covid population wide level, healthy people almost surely looking serious illness due virus weigh risk possible unforseen possibly serious side effects brand new drug, small still present risk developing serious illness dying despite young healthy, potential risks long term effects catch covid. id imagine alot ""wait see"" crowd waiting hear potential side effects trustworthy sources connected pharmaceutical company making drug regulatory bodies approving drug. think could make real progress wait see crowd frank discussion vaccines, work, legitmate concerns side effects exist, unfortunatley exact chemistry vaccines seems patented proprietary. understand info would go right head well heads many americans, easily available seems like would great benefit public health, educate people may fence, also give information companies might aid providing vaccines, sooner, people countries possibly increased efficacy, whereas keeping exact chemistry secret proprietary seems benefit aside profit.  I'm Canadian Australia.  Plenty racism here. Probably Canada. anti-mask idiots nothing compared US. last outbreak due entitled assholes adhere self quarantine rules came home overseas. COVID statistics limiting travel, mask compliance. Internal restrictions recently relaxed. took flight Perth Brisbane recently 1 2 people wearing mask flight. know NZ people compliant rules majority praise good leadership early lockdowns travel restrictions. 

Some South East Asian countries probably good examples. Poverty, crowding, big populations, yet high compliance mask wearing. Countries like Vietnam surprised me. stop fighting other, shutting schools despite evidence, help get together? seriously controversial? think accidentally linked Verizon cell coverage map. good country going charge people get vaccine protects everyone? article incorrect. Trial participants Pfizer (myself included) received booster 21 days. hell getting 1.2 million. checked CDC says 268k deaths year. 13.7 million cases.

Either works unless wanna get petty. spot on, depressing.  people herd, would care better. hope make tourists (or people who'll come live here) travel Hawaii escape pandemic. need influx people coming spreading virus here. read whole article say anything fans. part anything said implies think people reading thoughts?

you're even paying attention trying make cogent argument. amazing thing flu basically stomped year steps taken mitigate COVID. shows much contagious dangerous COVID compared influenza. 

Here's comparison last year year 'regular' influenza week 47 (last week). 2019 tested 21,367 samples ended 1,700 positives influenza B. year tested 33,351 ended 55. We're testing 1/3 samples getting 1% positives. Sure, NYC got hit way harder months ago. Cumulative numbers much meaningful happens given point time.  authorities lot answer for. insane consider kind sentiment controversial statement.   basically don’t anything could risk need medical attention nothing left spare. scary least something take minds environmental catastrophe. RemindMe! 5 months Two-thirds asymptomatics sero-positive, definitely infected. remaining one-third could mixture false positives (as acknowledged) people infected fought basis innate cell responses, antibody response gone background levels time testing.

Of course PCR detect non-infectious viral fragments, typically shed already recovered there's still cellular debris nasal epithelium mucus. cannot detect stray viral particle someone happened inhale swabbed. [limit detection PCR tests usually order hundreds copies per typically one swab going 3 mL UTM.  clarify vaccine providers may charge administration fee giving shot, individuals fee providers get fee reimbursed patient’s public private insurance company or, uninsured patients, Health Resources Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund,” CDC sister going that, vaccine thing clear. Even then, I’ll take day two feeling like shit (potentially) actually COVID. Honestly, would probably best I’d ever feel feeling sick, happen side effects oof, near miss. glad okay joined Covid Bereavement group FB. helps  ever wondered life means anything local government Florida (and pretty much anywhere else point) - know almighty Dollar far, far important. least gives clarity perspective little worth (outside income, course.) need leave would temporarily able automation takes over. r/nottheonion People worried long term side effects. kind hard argue that. nothing infuriating knowing fact whole debacle could’ve easily avoided. healthcare worker pharmacist, I'll get I'm forced (my job likely require too). worked pharmacy long studying drugs/vaccines... lot side effects new medications pop road hit general public myriad conditions.

Hopefully vaccine safe, let's pretend 100% safe right now. long term data there. RCT sits top hierarchy

Exactly field science work think *self-reported* RCT top hierarchy? RCT held high regard they're usually strict, however one anything but. Wow. idea fuckin ROCKWALL. mind blown. Condolences, Redditor. Take care yourself. It’s didn’t know particular virus behaved manner. average age death coronavirus (~82) higher average age death period (~80).

Under mortalilty probabilities, average age death living group always higher average age death born (aka life expectancy). Love it, hospitals almost year prepare this, getting extra money top charge care covid cases, nothing prepare, people going start dying due space. Blame them, blame China, blame big pharma, blame anything else, stop blaming damn good anyway. 

Masks work slow spread, proven fact now. Everyone wears damn mask everwhere now, even Kansas, cases going work. Either advocate shutting entire country month, accept going get .03% chance dying it...

Get fucking grip.  there's still need material things.

Obviously, way outta league. Ijs. LOL ""Now know virus deadly"" statement pushed advocating complete reopenings since May. I've heard talking point numerous times Fox, specifically tucker carlson. claim true. 

Fauci, many experts, claimed Covid would 10x deadly Flu. estimates made around early March. IHME, numerous models, estimate IFR around .9% wave Spring, roughly around 10x deadly Flu. 

That death rate cut half since spring wave better treatment methods, including use corticosteroids, intubating patients less etc. better methods fatality rate inside hospital cut down. 

It's ""the virus deadly"" first thought.

Bad update: husband 35 ended dying COVID, healthy far anyone concerned.

Wait virus cross blood brain barrier. people still like muh herd immunity. [archive link anyone trouble accessing archive Loved hated, unfortunately. PK caught much shit years. I'm sure people look back fondly w nostalgia, especially hospital donation.  It’s exactly seasonal flu map normally looks like press metal piece hard hug nose tightly. Vaccines given front line medical personnel first. 2 doses 3 weeks apart, another 4 weeks see antibodies. take many months enough vaccine distributed given rest population. It’s supposed delivered every state couple weeks, even states lack distribution plan.  states either won’t get vaccine, get waste it. us keep healthcare system collapsing long possible.

Good luck that. state mostly good hospitals filling import cases. unethical test vaccine child (who legally cannot consent) safety data adults. adults first, test 16-18, 14-16, 12-14 etc Reddit. feelings important law.

I'm young boring wfh average person. I'm likely last. Yup got tested Illinois yesterday said they’d call results. Never called. Fun times love called ""bipartisan"" democrat involved almost republican. either get vaccine live quarantine lifestyle forever. choose vaccine. think issue vaccines similar masks.

Early pandemic people trying hoard masks (and cleaning supplies, TP, etc) enough healthcare workers. masks became wide available, problem became many people refuse wear made pandemic worse.

In beginning see people fighting gets vaccine first. Later problem antivaxxers prolong pandemic. It’s opposite strategy you’re deliberately letting people die protect economy. It’s deliberately nothing reason. Remember horrified welded infected people homes? looking kinda tempting point... Hi all, found girlfriend exposed Covid 19. wondering expect healthy 23 year olds?

I think Americans scared back early March lot people heeded stay home warnings early on. Nowadays nobody seems afraid anything. politicians aren’t worried breaking rules, anyone else be. 

Even though Covid-19 still 10 times deadlier flu, people stopped worrying might die, even though die. Absolutely tragic. Hooray! county “emerging hotspot” opposed full-fledged coronacane. Excuse fucking shit *so far* get vaccination brain worms? Deaths catching now. Here’s report article about. [Olfactory transmucosal SARS-CoV-2 invasion port central nervous system entry individuals Yeah think Trump actually gives shit us can't moronic. sadistic narcissistic. virus crosses blood brain barrier getting ready trip Europe early February. late December tuned going China knew international travel coming up. tried find masks late January couldn’t, everyone thought overblowing paranoid. Two weeks came back Europe trip everything started shutting down. one thought paranoid anymore. 

It’s crazy thinking back coming back US JFK time. late feb, flight China landed time flight. held everyone China flight hall allow everyone else pass. baggage claim roped off. outside that, everyone assimilated together. It’s wonder NYC explosion like did. Covid time bomb, ticking point. took weeks come blows. We're getting started. use double sided tape leftover insulating windows, cut strips put inside mask along sides nose ear/cheek.

It creates waay better seal keeps breath fogging glasses! Staffing biggest problem places. Extra beds relatively easy realize, can't magically create nurses doctors.

Fortunately we’re never really super close together except passing we’re pretty excellent wearing masks, I’m hoping might fine even (hopefully doesn’t) tests positive. That's actually true? There's much evidence point toward significant increase suicides, even were-it'd require 5 fold increase previous years par 2020 COVID deaths, that's just...not gonna happen. 


Regardless, solution increase support mental health care access (which least US, needed happen anyway), increase financial support, ignoring pandemic. Watching loved ones die preventable death tends great morale. dont see ways. 
How virus entering jails?

Vaccinate problem solved. Preorder mate pandemic-related unemployment programmes US end week 26th 31st December. 31st, student loans start become due again. lately, still around 750000 people losing jobs every week due COVID-19. Yeah, 92% 20 cases like 2 cases vaccine compared 18 placebo. Pfizer Moderna least 100 think. That's feel worst for... people trying. Especially places virtually one else is. must horrible. may well true, people read comment think literally means 50 year olds rather elderly, know going around telling people they're wrong herd immunity rather simply saying ""he probably means 75 year olds nursing homes"" Yeah, that’s Swiss cheese defense layers analogy - multiple practices (masks, distancing, ventilation, etc.) (hopefully) minimize risks.  Eccomi. Anche un singolo giorno fa la differenza. Perché dovrebbe essere affrettato se è già stato approvato da un'agenzia affidabile? Intanto le dosi vanno chi approva prima I've noticed airline passenger load increased tremendously past months, especially United Airlines. believe contributing spread coronavirus. flights, potential spread virus. care people, care making profits paying CEO's millions dollars laying staff. 

Airports management give rats ass employees. keep telling staff hurry get passengers checkpoint. Okay, there's wait time. what. Passengers wait, flight going anywhere long arrive timely manner. running late, passengers fault employee processes slow. immune-compromised people can't get virus. safe spread dies out. 

It seem like would long widely available spread die out, like would wait much longer feel like saving lives holding off. 1918 showed learned nothing. next pandemic unforgiving lack policy individual practice adherence, it'll darwin-like purge.

""In addition, shorter quarantine period lessen stress public health system community, especially new infections rapidly rising.""   CDC based decisions study data modeling done agency outside institutions, Walke said. said 14 days quarantine remains optimal period time, 7 10 days good alternative. 

So, 7 days negative test minimum 14 still preferred. sounds like ""fine 10 days plz jfc least something"" Immunologists bothered talking much they're much less worried reddit is. already 2020 Michael Bay movie “Songbird” way wonder feels responsible much death?

Are Republican governor? 

I'm starting wonder feel anything all, honestly. Yeah, understand concerns. large trials done reason scientists aren’t pushing trials longer even supported pausing Oxford trials investigate possible serious side effects participants. 

This technology isn’t entirely new. mRNA vaccines studied decades first one approved. think would know common serious side effects show years later.
And biologically wouldn’t make much sense did. mRNA degrades quickly body temperature (hence ultra-cold storage) immune response causes vaccine side effects would dissipate mRNA does. Gee, it’s almost like scientists something. everyone miss Michael Bay covid-23 movie trailer? sarcasm. called Songbird. heard does, that's use. Soap quickly destroy outer membrane virus. next question research.

We've heard Pfizer/Moderna ones help reduce symptoms immensly. question would Oxford vaccine also reduces symptoms. also reduces symptoms (such shortage breath, severe cough, lung damage), Oxford vaccine would spectacular even stop virus 1/3 time, it'll least protect severe symptoms. 

But looking info one there's anything I've learned last 4 years US, thoughts prayers fix ANYTHING. CARES Act signed law Trump March 27th BioNTech Man, made vaccine. Calling Pfizer vaccine error American press made popularized. “patchy”. Areas reach herd immunity different times. Expect state state relaxation based different percentages infected/vaccinated. carry mask till August. all.

I'm agreement think. subtle gripe.

The whole idea people ""anti science"" bullshit. people blatantly ""anti science"".

If accuse someone anti science they're going shut refuse hear anything else admitted understanding perspective.

An example back Christian (now atheist)

Our church use eat ""irreducible complexity"" thing. So... instead telling someone they're anti science itd better show irreducible complexity flawed.

Unfortunately biases fear get way, lot people really hard time , so.. guess lot anti science, know that. saying help.

All im saying know enemy.

Too lazy cover nuances. Forget said anything. Granted. Many arrive later spring. Canada said need donate countries. Nothing stopping visiting friends? fact can’t hear word saying? Yeah, percentage ""mah FREEDUMS"" crowd led superspeader chief large sane people stop it. article days ago economists advocating actually paying people take vaccine. suggested $1,000. 

It's great idea - would stimulus, get people take virus helps public health economic activity overall.

Fuck legislators. especially fuck mayor Denver. Must part media lies. Trump feels 20 years younger. Wholly agree. Religion enemy science. Wait told free? believe single bill said vaccine free. know bills said free covid-19 testing. Vaccine nothing yet. claim give vaccine free one 100% certain. 

What know write estimated cost 3k going charge amount one knows. Maybe insurance many people jobs homes... many people able afford it. wanting rushed vaccine new type right away? Untested long term side effects usually vaccines take 10 years go safety trials. Also mention virus 99.7% recovery rate 50. Totally unreasonable question safety necessity virus though, right.

I hope friend relative gets mild case deal mini-strokes rest life. sub convinced rollout vaccine next two years going big disaster lockdown. Entirely many people believe vaccine magic bullet entirely many people believe vaccine useless truth don’t clue vaccines effective way. 

Nobody wants wait data. Cases falling weeks. Hospitalisations lag cases they'll fall (and falling) right thinks letting insurance companies self regulate whatever want, standard health insurance side things too. Get real guys. still free without insurance! people sub frantically arguing downvoting everything shows truth hilarious. 

Normalcy return spring. Get egos Ummm... taking 2 weeks work sheer paranoia ""immaterial""? can't afford quarantine long reason. Neither people. think vaccine failure almost 70 years ago used justify worried long term effects current vaccines. would like pointing airplane crashes 50s show dangerous flying be.

I'm implying vaccine 100% safe, long term effects COVID much evident long term effects vaccine. Mad cow 90s something recent? Funny state values environment much, citizenry content watch burn down. polluted cities country. sucked water sources.

Which one believe? vaccine costs around $20 per dose, you’re barking wrong tree. definitely non troll argument. said fix situation worthless. So, meaning literally buy house gets street, worthless.

When economy shut down, shut down. opens up, people allowed take advantage going restaurant would like that. nothing wrong that. see problems people regular basis, see different groups people week, wear masks, otherwise take precautions. take lot precautions see others same, actually fairly unlikely someone spread coronavirus.

It top seen family members throughout entire pandemic live near you. reason that. see family outside, wearing mask, socially distanced, virtually 0 risk. top take risk eating outside careful risk would still quite low.

Mayor Breed flaunting anything. hate break news wealthy people always be. wealthy friends. well aware politicians celebrities money. enjoy it, year. Nothing wrong it. supporting local restaurant too. 

I think people going overboard leaving homes getting bitter someone otherwise. Well, healthy stay home never see anyone. see people things safely. 

You can't judge someone else's situation really know prepared interaction, (was anyone elderly medical conditions maybe someone already covid immunity). Maybe careful weeks prior go eat anywhere risky months. Maybe also get tested regular basis (not foolproof helps). Maybe precautions taken. Every situation fact different gray areas. Sorry like that. link CNN article saying free US. Never said gonna butt fucked number cases. ""Predicted collapse within 3 weeks"" different thing. I’m struggling figure censored, bet censored reason, could give hint? collection chucklefucks. Lol nothing corrupt administration dude knew, charge the, domestic terrorism biological attack.

For record, works independently Trmp, @ title countless others thanks! Stupidity though. imagine going generation’s end World War 2 celebration we’re allowed massive gatherings again. “One condition underscores prediction: willingness American adults become vaccinated.”

Unfortunately serious skepticism ability this. Belief science politicized. Fact hasn’t outweighing baseless doubt. antivaxers extreme, many people actually think still hoax. Half country voted man still day discredits downplays severity we’re living through. think something we’re going living rest lives.

I absolutely hope I’m wrong. got covid bcs placebo group? Yeah civil rights movement really cured racism inconvenient non-violent protests. Ambulances city essentially stopped picking COVID patients respiratory distress. That's happens hospitalization rate gets close 40%. There's place put them. 100% billionaires celebrities sports stars right?  basically thing work, I'm - right, done safely. 

Now, ponder going boss's head asked visit office person, hard figure - needed better job, needed better understanding I'm actually doing. 

I chose drive (PA NJ), stopped gas, stayed hunkered hotel room office. place visited colocation center already crazy strict protocols regardless covid. 

It valuable work (which I've worried since started anyway) relaxing away house stop presenting problems... least days. 

Along lines, speaking house problems, I've plumbers/the water company outside home get fixed. Yes, guess ""gathered"" plumbers, took precautions I, trying let basement get completely flooded turd water. want sewage bubbling yard. nice giant hole spray painted boards it. might hit today. Wow, really use common sense rationalism writing comment you? point shelter-in-place equate quitting job? means staying home except work essential needs physical live (e.g. cancer treatment, groceries, etc.). time.

nah.. even then, big chunk folks questions would likely take without question required something use e.g. work, social clubs, fitness centres, etc. unfortunately ignored majority base.

How determining this? catch watching tv shows &amp; getting blips panic they're socially distanced wearing masks. going weird transition back ""normalcy."" 100 years one gives fuck anymore. That’s reality life. You’re forgotten within ten years you’re buried. Dude lol know nowhere near same. even ballpark. Trmp obviously ignored intelligence get go. 

May good estimate normalcy. hospital system Italy didn’t collapse, sure hospitals Bergamo overran. What’s point? there’s vacant ICU bed anywhere US, we’re okay? share one example militia/armed protestor group helped improve stated problems? watched specifically harass Dem governors well moderates like DeWine, otherwise policy changes happened beyond Americans dying due anti mask morons. UK lined shot okay person taking temps interaction short . Best wear mask done outside. Obviously taking temps definitely going pick potentially positive people though. That's good, heard that. 

I guess it'll trickle establish safety. know enough vaccines know there's particular risk different ages hopefully time they're vaccinating really little kids problem anymore anyways. know place American understand, Welsh first minister fucking here.

He could advocate closing pubs altogether, doesn't. that, pay support pubs.

Instead, taking away reason people going pubs first place, guaranteeing wont 'need' government support ensuring eventually vanish. Well, flying literally job lol.  Intresting hear I'm alone this. I'm concerned young children maybe quite can't remember pre-COVID life well COVID life 'normal'. going able handle large crowds easily? Ironic parts US, UK, Germany, France lockdowns again, Asian ""Swarms"" (as put it) Korea, Japan, China mostly living lives mask-free since contained epidemic.

Luckily, strong supportive union helping make through. I'm still anxious scared 2021 could still mean 12 months worst-case scenario. Nevertheless, best news I've heard loooooong time.  East Tennessean here. I’m terrified. done for. Front line you! Yeah, get experiences virus it’s effects impacted views covid. really sounds like sucks. People different perspectives different reasons. one wants permanent side effects virus, people aren’t afraid isn’t much know permanent effects covid new is. Thankfully Covid bad Ebola. seems viruses super high death rates like Ebola, spread quickly easily less deadly viruses like covid. Would scary types virus spread easily Stupid equivalent. One terrorist attack mass murder. illness. heart disease deaths every day equivalent 9/11 numbers years. I’ve heard Pfizer started trial kids 12, that’s comfort.

Looking friends families, support #45, say probably not. arrogance incompetence towards situation real, deffo derived lack guidance. probably need reread comment really carefully. Sure, consequences great. you’re recommending every employed person working outside home assume Covid (due job) leave work immediately. You’re effectively recommending general strike. nurses head home could’ve exposed? Doctors? Pharmacists? firefighters EMTs? Waiters? Chefs? mean get person isn’t thinking options could think “assume Covid went Thanksgiving” reasonable thing say. direct impacts workers public sphere right now. Nurses doctors surely contact Covid average Thanksgiving goer. messaging “If (financially, practically) stay home quarantine, should. can’t, monitor symptoms, get tested it’s available you, take precautions—wear mask, keep distance can, wash hands, etc.” believe people might take seriously numbers could also reported city. Also, across board, I’ve wondered numbers reflect individual’s place residence took positive test. Anyone know? UK gay active sexually remember read last time donated.

We're progressive times! set trap. hedgehog fell it. Fuck calling ""least necessary"". human beings. contribute society. low paid jobs, temporarily losing jobs foes mean necessary deserve assistance. 

Lets pretend ""essential jobs"" actually necessary. They're not. 🧟‍♂️ wasn’t bad, lost 6 smh. giving them. personal you, means fine. numbers speak themselves. big outbreaks jails due guards family visits. family visits restricted, guards source outbreaks. Vaccinate problem solved.
Once vaccines available general public, people jail also vaccinated. Gving people incarcerated within building absolutely chance interact people unknown vaccine like giving people island never set foot outside island vaccine. Instead, vaccinate source dont waste them. virus really dangerous allowed spread unchecked, basically happening States. really takes keep COVID becoming serious problem requires government intervention; amount telling people #stayhome #wearamask substitute mass, effective testing, business closures, border controls, proper isolation/quarantine procedures. 

The US government placed burden COVID response citizens, flagrantly flaunting unresponsiveness disobedience. Also, check immediately going two flights stairs. showed pretty low couple minutes later, think low 90s. get sick hospital overflow. isn’t options won’t listen. This.

Wow. That's almost full week's rent areas.

/s thought different strains, different course disease person. think caught someone asymptomatic ""the sniffles"" get sniffles, too; easily get full-blown illness. Germany bad job recently 10 FEMA morgue trucks

Never flu season happened. really think there'll even 100 million doses country February 28th, let alone 200 million doses required vaccinate 100 million people? German federal government confirmed 7 million vaccine doses available first quarter 2021. goes hope somewhat normal summer.

The pessimistic predictions ""20% vaccinated next winter"" beginning look scarily realistic.  people complaining takes far outweigh takes Yeah blindly trust company's analysis instead. Fuck off, clearly know nothing medicine regulation Full covid patients live NYC, did, blood would worth NY Jets tickets. understand urge get go backpacking camping.

in like... summer lol. point. You’re making big stink nothing. vaccines tested children yet won’t able get anytime soon. Even general public able children still won’t be. literally nonissue time tired winning. Fauci believes everyone able get vaccine April, everyone wants vaccine done 2 course regime June/July.

I challenge consider alternate possibility looking data presented study researcher: Tennessee GDP 1/10th California.... progress? I’m familiar Colorado unemployment, I’m almost sure provide partial unemployment reduced working hours. early spring

That late Feb. way late UK starting next week  election party numbers serious? people washed hands, wore mask stayed inside bad. Instead people irresponsible many businesses shuttered be, hospitals overwhelmed cancer patients can't get treatment. asked children stop attending school, stop learning. fucks sake man. part problem dragged long has. That’s point, they’re winners. It’s money, hundreds millions dollars made season cancelled leagues would fucked. tv contracts sign don’t allow season “not happen.” Yes also know people vacillate nothing, total shut-ins first peak, vacationing around going bars, restaurants, etc., summer. weeks ago said becoming shut-ins again, accidentally admitted restaurants again. 

I think see collective change behavior cell phone data (e.g. look state's graphs IHME site). People gradually stopped keeping social distancing. lot people PTSD (as already do). friends social media claim scared come work shit pops partying call stalking. May doable actually near someone infected indoors, airplane air safe get.

Yes. love Poseidon, want hear full arena pop Jon Moxley's AEW title reign once. once. 

Of things cheated television pandemic, one stings most. much wrong comment. 

First all, unemployment taxed. fill form every two weeks, there's even box check take taxes get hit big tax burden April. 

But main thing money temporary. get much year it, last year. lasted little longer pandemic, Great Recession, still full year. $600 stimulus months, that's unemployed certain time. lost job months later, get all. 

Also, talking max amount, applies people making certain amount. People making minimum wage get far less max amount. Sadly, situation media gives pass one side attacking anything side does. Given bad (CDC et al) saying next months be, believe minds change riskier. Tweak improve. Tweak improve. Sarcasm save anyone.     $1000? That's way little. vaccine advertised, better open within months. masks, social distancing. vaccine 95% effective distributed people risk (hopefully occur within first 2-3 months) actually (finally) makes virus less dangerous flu. 

If still telling us social distance, wear masks, etc. needs action. Politicians love control. went along (well, us) risk. risk drops season flu still forcing measures, better take back freedom quickly. longer goes on, apathetic become. isn’t even winter yet. mean?

You need fuck inability appreciate people deal grim situations. Statistically Speaking improvement VA. allowed operate business provides livelihoods. open doesn’t spread virus. People make decision decide whether want risk catching deciding go eat. government allowed shut businesses like this. Given incident rate something like encephalitis GBS basically guaranteed vaccines hit millions people least one person present getting one. response extremely crucial. long events vaccine protocols place I'll completely comfortable going  Same. fucking hate wearing zero scientific reason wear alone. I'm it. depends difficult produce effective vaccine treatment; one relatively lucky case major vaccine candidates moved along smoothly serious issues. seeing get canned midway trials feeling optimistic right now.

Also, get one higher mortality rate next time, response going cut it, even speed may able create vaccine. Mandatory vaccines temporary? 
 Stupidity highly contagious far damaging Getting go weekly trivia game best bud drinking brew eating tasty af burger, that’ll moment  That's gonna lot Freedom Towers. full application normally become publicly available right approval? shit sucks. Can't relate metropolitan area New England. Good know California free rednecks. Like Bakersfield. Fresno. northern California.

how many billions dollars California incur year wildfires? guys like power shut prevent fires? third world shit hole.

Don't forget California's generous homeless population. probably bigger population Mississippii. know, California progressive people treated equally, right?

Is progress? No, wouldn't. would conclude response government plays large role populace responds.

 America great example. government spent entire pandemic playing severity refusing act national scale prevent spread, even going far threaten states acted protect people.
 Sweden, hand, suggested protect getting sick acknowledged importance infection prevention technique's people listened. 

Of course find people across world bad actors. That's discussion having. discussion governments democratic nations elected represent well citizens held account fail job (this extends beyond covid response still relevant here). America done opposite every turn turned country global cautionary tale. still think people arrested wearing open toed sandals/flip flops flights. 

It’s disgusting, feet disgusting don’t want look 4 hours, plus means go barefoot thru security nasty nasty human being. paid Russia. Russian-funded killings ok.  Enjoy outdoors can. next lockdown coming state continues set embarrassing amount records.

2nd lockdown. sucks. That's embarrassing, well done California. *hugs*  ""anxiety general public"" Prez started talking positively vaccines run election, opposing party wanted make sure Prez would get anything helpful talked every media outlet possible. realized actually *did* need people take came ridiculous idea ad hoc state run review would thorough career scientists CDC FDA.

Cuomo's move purely political, nothing scientific way helpful public trying calm anxiety helped cause. big thing COVID mortality rate perfect spread. believe Ebola MERS far contagious, deadly, died quicker never reached scale COVID has. deadly virus might have, ironically, better humanity whole COVID wouldn’t able spread far wide quickly did. 1918-1919 time Spanish Flu, 20's ""Roaring 20's"". over, people party like 1999. Here’s thing - want COVID control don’t want lockdowns mask wearing end. want mandated quarantine without actual virus people losing jobs. They're probably covid deniers stressful job honestly, would said same. People really told times. think it’s ‘don’t even bother seeing loved ones’ that’s mainly getting downvoted. Maybe try ‘continue social distance’ bold/big print. Nope, smallpox worst. people actively working didnt 

Is rest complete comment context. said complete sentence relay point. Cutting comment halfway form *you want say* doesn’t work lmao. I’m also reiterating fourth time that’s meant. let donate traveled malaria risk area wait February. husband went find vein he's dark he's constantly exposed COVID hospital. 

We know importance frustrating keep getting rejected. Especially people input travel incorrectly get blocked year. truth offends that's problem. name medicine?  still let gay men sex trafficking survivors multiple clean HIV tests donate. (To fair, problem federal government guidelines, individual blood banks. wish federal government eager shoot foot.)

They really consider rolling kidneys student loan forgiveness program, would that. read article talking earlier pandemic. said essentially shown bad actors easy cripple country right biological weapon. country could create virus vaccine, could vaccinate population allies, rest world deals consequences. get saying, knowing infectious important. mean knowing numbers infected though. still case recorded so. 

A person testing positive threshold 40 maybe way becoming infections, way it. 

Here Australia finding even people way crucial, means contact trace find cases around case. Hard argue month zero cases result. 

In USA little ability properly contact trace, yes knowing low positives useful. still think reported though. seems like sticking head sand. Friday payday I’m planning set aside $100 food/snack donations local ICU &amp; Covid staff. definitely super thankful me. &amp; coworkers made big card &amp; fruit cookie arrangement month got out. 

I remember back March-April still Hospital,... asking younger shift-nurses got field motivates them, etc. remember talking time asking ever thought they’d experience pandemic like this. (and back March right!?,.. gotten worse unfortunately due peoples shortsighted selfishness. I'm excited examine raw data vaccine trial. anyone know published? Okay, voted one hundred percent certain percentage vote different candidates? I'm excited examine raw data vaccine trial. anyone know published? Well, duh. mean ignore vaccines entirely. many cities doses would usable. undoubtedly lost least two friends lost shit touted percentages statistics prove shouldn’t destroy economy this. 

I’m damned tired money important actual human lives. statistics absolutely zero place conversation mortality. matters absolute number deaths. consider preventable been...I lost patience tolerance around 270k+ deaths ago.

*Edit: spelling American economy would much better population vaccinated countries. fact. I'm excited examine raw data vaccine trial. anyone know published? need make shittier though. I'm Santa Rosa. town hardly anymore. one year wiped map yes Let go dude, idiot isn’t arguing good faith Ok stop working home go back 4 hour commute :/ beginning people doubted would ever one. doubted would year. doubted would 50% effective. we're here. exact quote used article mid-December, end February, potentially immunized 100 million people,"" Moncef Slauoi, scientific advisor government's Operation Warp Speed (OWS) program told reporters.

Yeah, **potentially**. That's like seeing ""sales ^(up to) 50% off!"" Removing titles like inevitably result people thinking take vitamin C COVID-19 symptoms, can't giving medical advice here. least freedoms ^/s lol. based vaccine effectiveness much 100 patients, ??? matter. Majority people read actual article. title click-baiting mechanism. matter says. read article posting comment; understand. still follows principle trying profit unnecessary fear. Seriously, wrong people! Almost 1%? think something 99% people survived bad? used work restaurant West Edmonton Mall (WEM) every holiday season would stupidly, impossibly busy entire month December, feeling could literally feel emptiness mall January 1st would go open shift. feeling lack people constantly last however-long. It’s weird feeling. 

I never thought one second would MISS called work 3 people didn’t show people basically standing top trying get table chaotic shit end night always okay always good time end. hated constant crowds sometimes resented it, literally *crave it* knowing it’s going thing least couple years again, society may never actually operate way ever again, killing me. weird thing miss. We’re getting point we’re desperate socially, humans extremely social creatures need people. I’d bet LEFT NUT machines sold made $x,xxx amount dollars

But we’re sold hospitals government $xxx,xxx amount dollars. 

Hell I’d bet NUTS. 

Follow money... joke. sucked see everyone unemployment get help needed Wealthy suburban Northern va completely rules state punishes poorer , rural south southwest Virginia sorts regulations, gas taxes, etc. 

Crossing border rural Virginia neighboring states eye opener, neighboring states better rural poor va. It’s like Detroit compared Canada next door. 


The state needs broken good everyone  targeting industries end targeting people? even issue necessarily race. target industries people effected get job done irregardless race. racism anyways? Everyone position bad spot. Spouting race related statistics circumstances involve PEOPLE every race specifically makes sense. Everyone make race reality people race situation need help. Thanks update! blame feeling uncomfortable. know operating recovery wards, here, air filtration really strict I'd surprised also case hospital. million way Ok yeah, makes sense. Using analogies practically impossible anyway. I've seen masks compared seatbelts, etc. Lots driving analogies. speed wind killing someone, get thrown jail. kind works. lot easier tell happened case (well, hit runs would akin knowingly spreading virus getting trouble sort). 

Another thing that's hard sometimes people try make moderately safe choices jive life - essential workers, people contact public jobs government safety net keep getting evicted worse... moderately safe choice could fine, could literally die kill someone else.

I think lot people stupid - included stuff. also think super duper largely fault governing body basically said, ""fuck you, figure out,"" given barely assistance people situations like listed above. Many barely lowkey racist. Pretty close openly hating homosexuals. matter dem/liberals fault socialist, communist, hate America. Hillary, Obama, Biden Satan incarnate. 

When Elizabeth Smarts dad came discussing struggles talk show one said he's ""tired promoting this"". like promoting what? said ""this gay stuff"". Another agreed. 

I count one hand number people speak anything. us shift. noticed change Obama. trump gotten bad. years I've worked seeing less minorities used be. quit things talk badly them. People think got won't. think news vaccines probably led lot people letting guard well. Forgot ask, approximately world you? literally stated twice wasn’t blaming unemployed saying didn’t deserve help, sucks got helped didn’t. purposely misread that?  Kinda naive lmao [And already starting rise Lockdowns useless real strategy protect citizens. vaccine companies signed agreements multiple countries millions doses general timelines shipment. countries proactive others. Generally first batches doses prioritized country origin.

Canada expects 6 million doses total across vaccines procured March 2021, we're apparently one proactive countries. 

What expect, 100% doses available January? guidelines haven’t changed, still need practiced vaccines roll out: Wear mask. Keep socially distanced. Wash hands often. Avoid groups people. Stay home much can. Says man allowed Donald Trump dictate agencies guidelines schools opened. Fuck Redfield spineless. Rich people, right? I've said downvoted *oblivion* I'll say again...

# nowhere near end tunnel. months, years, go normalcy.

# Get ready wear masks next months. don’t even bother seeing loved ones. Stay home stop burden society benefit. Nobody, American otherwise going react well ""do told."" condescending hell. he's going professional, needs act like one. much better ways saying much productive.

Oh love -5 downvotes. though actually say this.... Oh I’m mad. Trash like waste space life. glad finally caught on. cannot stand politicians. terrible. Unemployed people helped! 2/3 average person I'm assuming 14-day test positivity rate sat 5.6% one week ago. Tuesday, number skyrocketed 6.5%. past 24 hours, rose nearly half percent 6.9%. state large California, half percent alone could mean many 200,000 infections.  Wednesday, state’s Covid-19 dashboard indicated 20,759 new cases reported past 24 hours. That’s nearly 2,500 cases previous high 18,350. Even worse, testing numbers generally trended upward, state’s test positivity rate skyrocketed, well. (More tests usually mean declining positivity rate.)  yet, California still lower poverty rate Tennessee There’s downturn cases tests available. Oh :( also Texas hazard guesses where. hope things let y'all soon. I'm glad friend better.  Sorry, trying imply - saying there's enough evidence us say there's amount risk, opposed denialists's argument lack solid evidence far (because enough time studies) equates ""We can't prove harmful yet must harmless!""

Didn't mean imply view know right? cleans mess afterwards? host everybody else, left chores. anti-vaxxers find way distrust stunt.

""They made switch right injection""

""The anti-vaxxer got injection secret service agent working cover""

It's probably greater chance wanting vaccine told can't letting try find loopholes get it. Yeah that’s crazy.. true though. another commenter already stated, things average deaths per day 9/11. redditor responding blatantly lied, spreading misinformation, making choice respond promoting lie chose fact check it. Resign. People pressing resign. wait next election. Resign now. need support family. youtubes ambient restaurant sounds play I'm eating sometimes get takeout. actually helps. 

Here's one -  Everywhere US pretty much hotspot now, way worse Spring. barely escaped disaster back mean now. holidays, states abandoning meaningful restrictions people giving shit time high.. extremely likely could collapse. Unless something drastic changes, current trajectory looking like worst case scenarios predicted. 

The vaccine roll-out take probably till summer effective. get much worse current conditions. thought trial cancelled doctors complaining since get enough info vaccine. became Buddhist years ago, buddhist meditation communities silent retreats became backbone mental health maintenance. thought resilient AF work, two silent retreats canceled year, able attend one hopefully next June. Without community support, I've completely fallen back old unhealthy coping mechanisms drinking. nuts much rely community can't wait back. Super miss live music festivals well. course. surprised happen? last time let house making money?? slowest car wreck every Brexit. It’s going 4 years now. close second deaths reported reported before, deaths happened today reported today.  like make crime stupid public, in, anti vax, anti mask, climate change denial, punishable death. I’m employed worked every single day throughout pandemic. job never closed. actual essential business however, makes sense. sucked see everyone unemployment get help needed people actively working pandemic much higher risk got nothing. (Not say unemployed didn’t deserve help, contrary) hope going \*dead bodies\* believe want believe- wish well contract virus, hope whatever options choose work you. 
The real point comment wasting Senate's time craziness. silly assertions senator Wisconsin (I also WI) lead believe needs list things might interested pursuing. collective many pressing matters attend to, arguing (after evidence contrary) egregious. I'd guess it'll break least 750 then. Likely 800. someone quarantining year.. can't wait vaccine. worst year life. extroverted people can't function like properly. Still waiting.

This information simple find take moment prove inept completing simple Google search.

...Right? I've looked it, rough transition additional schooling. 

Ireland admittance allows practice EU, lot easier obtain, roadblock immigration part. tough secure job without connections make much anyway. 

UK ireland require pass QLTT, school, take states. think need specific specific state license, one new York they're UBE.

You practice US law anywhere technically though, either firm, house, setting practice near large military base handling family law matters. mean sure, claim face masks reduced covid cases [population city] - [confirmed cases city] that’s really bad science, isn’t it? Models don’t really mean much, especially type “analysis” understand need put face public. reason told us masks anything wear back March. You’re busy putting words mouth didn’t bother read understand said. know I'm going feel meeting people crowd long time.

I know always work like that, year pandemic year no-pandemic reverse it. like said he’s bad reading told expect every American wants vaccine one June equated vaccine won’t widely available June Probably month atleast, hard say due deaths usually lagging behind case counts Right safety priority. confirm safe 52% efficacy rate, sure approved vaccine. thinking 90% bad lol Except give health care, next asking higher education, planes trains, television, everything else. Lmao, yes. Muslim extermination, intellectual piracy, South Asian Sea bullshit, African Loan Sharking PrOpAgAnDa.  

As Asian, I'll say Fuck China. Sorry. Hope feeling OK. one time distinct event

So individual coronavirus infections, amalgamate either data set create trend. periodicity really matter, we're technical it.

I agree connecting R 'doubling time' metric would help people understand.

I disagree appropriate use word exponential characterize growth COVID salary. moments countries growth behave exponentially, seeing lot R 1.5 action. honestly never used sanitizers since beginning this. wear mask, wash hands works fine me. get point! CUT WRIST BLACK EYES Couple months, end clearly sight. Hang there, friend.  dont know state youre least theyre taking seriously. governor completely hands off, instead lockdowns hed rather send morgue trucks. fucked one going convince otherwise mate. can’t wait go back school actually go parties dances again! you’ve unemployed long enough, don’t even consider unemployed! could extend prayer 3-4 weeks people need leave wear special prayer face coverings multi-layered fit snugly nose mouth. don’t think I’ll ever ride car rather get car accident. Ah Life Insurance, weirdest gamble ever make. mean seems fair, life insurance providers likely snap up. depends optimistic future. would care us? get go breaks, get best healthcare, get increases pay every year, go home nice houses good food dime! What's incentivizing them? 

At point take cues receive free box N95 masks mail? understand research needed patient needs evaluated differently based normal them. 10 year old nephew got COVID prescribed Albuterol pediatrician even though oxygen level 95 percent underlying medical conditions. Seems reaching patients become critically low oxygen better understand emergency rooms overwhelmed however, hope PCPs proactive, like nephew's pediatrician was, prescribe breathing treatments hopefully prevent people ever make trip ER COVID. Years ago ended ER due asthma O2 level 88 percent resting heart rate ~180 bpm taken bed immediately wheelchair. could barely walk young healthy otherwise. Xopenex recently FDA approved prescribed ER docs (to replace Albuterol) keep heart rate down. years incident different doctor informed steroid inhaler prevent ever use albuterol/levalbuterol. Since going symbicort rarely need rescue inhaler nebulizer. Change good sometimes traditionally accepted becomes outdated think people starting re-think O2 levels hospital admittance around COVID. respiratory virus improving respiratory healthcare patients COVID breathing issues helpfully lessen severity rate mortality afflicted patients. Thanks responding. wonder quickly death rate drop distributed seniors Nah, we've least 5 last 100 years. Evidently downtown philly;) get everyone today 😂 think want converse you. I'm allowed opinion Yeah apparently call people actually take seriously stay fuck home. Yeah that’s exactly I’m looking too. legit concern tangible basis actually occur, given everything know genetic machinery?   

Just curious anyone feels personally uneasy concerned actually asks “why concern?” think that’s bad — *I* told would stop ***last Easter*** wtf? can't make ooooooooooooooooooooooowwnnnnn Nah, would Irish! Honestly, assumed covered ""first responders"". assume there's way realistically get home fairly safe? considered zoom video call family friends back home since atleast gives opportunity talk see face even thousands miles apart. Maybe cook favourite food Christmas know treat little. good movie marathon maybe? place totally safe. Including isolating house. Stop spreading anti-science shitty global practices?

you meant west's constant attacks China propagandas couple centuries right? Look Pfizers history. They're dodgy ass business. Dont trust one bit.  issues capitalist system, get healthcare really. FUCKING ROFL. words used. lol. paint however like never said suffer more. bad reading. 'No': like anything thats simply showing sign inteligence skeptisicm downvoted hell here

People arent anti vaxx getting shutdown downvotes simply questioning things

Grow fuck up, downvote want. Ill wait year atleast get mine. state harshest public restrictions country well mask mandate since June still struggling. seems right! cannot find anything saying otherwise mean, efficacy far less concern approval safety... sound lammmmmeeeeeeee

Fauci lied masks guess entire world 

Warp speed affiliation Trump, work independently 

Also hope widely available vaccine around March (redfield) April (Fauci) rather june like portrayed bc u lack reading comprehension 

I think need lure more/spend time sub there’s lot good resources here

Spring remains good estimate normal. fear may level cognitive decline prior Covid positive. gut feeling. Whichever year isn’t president anymore. 2021. case LA couple years ago people Measles decided go fast food drive through.

Appreciate...China's shitty global practices? 

oKaY~ better system, even Constitution forbid cruel unusual punishment.

Most people need medical care COVID-19. likely punishment would be... nothing.

Treat crime, please. corruption censored public information problem worldwide, MUCH serious Russia/China west. self-regulation. We--or least I--think companies able put profit considerations. industry, health care. mean idk dude said better Fauci Ever wondered ""Thrown buss"" came from? Again, Fauci lied greater good warp speed joke program created Trump administration. think April June could see us back normal head warp speed today said June every American wants vaccine get one (lol). think we'll getting back normal around time vaccine become widely available.

You major disappointment. Guy reddit know worlds elite scientist mate. may UK regulator long established process happens quicker US EU regulators. Changing new review process might able done quick safe way, countries quite reasonably need follow process instead copying decision UK. lol one thing note, learn appreciate, especially comparison. 

no one owes shit. *hugs* hang COVID toes. I've never experienced toes, appearance symptoms exactly I've read COVID toes, nothing else happened recently would caused this.


However, test negative COVID. read alot people COVID toes test negative.


I'm wondering-
Do people COVID toes test negative antibodies?
Should get tested antibodies?
Can infect others? I've quarantining past week since started feeling symptoms. #staythefuckhomeuntilvaccine Feh. New Zealand's achievement immensely greater, methodically acting avoid national disaster first place. Lololol 

Working public officials means probably make good enough estimate this

Nobody said anything hospitals, know public health is?

But anyways since u think ur better experts fauci said could hit relative normal april july argue Technically able deny coverage all, raise premium. want million-dollar policy, make cost million dollars. breakdown test accuracy vs days tested exposure? see within first 5 days, false negative happen 50-100% time. Exactly!!! see way. Listen scientists!!!! People die!!!! killing grandma!! Thank information! Oh is? Good know. really hard tell sometimes :/ use economic stimulus check incentive people get vaccine! Well guess good thing turn 18 may? suspect it’ll approved I’m mistakenly claiming clinical trials reached primary endpoint unpublished first interim results misrepresenting role regulators clinical trial design / execution. Shame you. specifically double friend chicken sandwich offered limited time KFC. like chicken sandwiches? sandwich chicken? suspect U/DoritoKat lives his/her parents. Please think words use then.

2 - parity outcome prove “the strategy unique”. seen reports recently virus around lot longer Wuhan? wastewater samples back far March 2019 (Spain, Italy, Brasil)? US Dec 2019? Truth is, virus circulating globe while. happens China first noted outbreak was.

You hate China, that's that's want do. first outbreak occurred there, mean that's also patient zero is. also mean outbreak occurred anywhere else. suspect US administration would fared better considering telling everyone would magically disappear many months virus outbreaking across globe.

Sorry say this, day need face ignorance.

For worth, hate China virus. contempt many world responded it. admire nations admirably admire people seek information truth amidst confluence disinformation there, contempt lack ability think beyond apply critical thinking.

The world hate China coronavirus. That's believing falsehoods presented order get think best interests.

Go. also recommend getting N95 pair non-prescription glasses act like mini face shield. feel safe N95 - works healthcare workers hospitals, work fine super low level exposure. gives reviews Moldex fine, doesn’t 3M Bureaucrats taking sweet time usual Mexico far cases per capita US. That's hospitals along border crowded. country stupid happens 26th? Wow. Optimism guy rare come by. Thank this...and congratulations learning cope lockdown better productive general.

Your words help others may feeling first time around.

I hope find job soon! :)

(PS - know Coursera? took really good psych course free April May delivered Yale professor. Free!) care people believe do, tell distant family bragged big Thanksgiving gathering praised Governor. went map shows percentage chance someone COVID gathering specific counties...it 94% Good luck! Jokes I’m already gay! make straight? Canada talking order vaccinated. Nothing determined there’s talk health care workers people long term care homes first.. 100% agree with. that, may go order age, oldest youngest. didn’t quite agree feel essential workers next think it, maybe someone 70 get firefighter due fact 70 year old wouldn’t likely healthy firefighter would lower chance surviving. interesting plays out. someone never tried popeyes... good? ""You're going lose people. going suicides thousands. going sorts things happen. going instability.""

Solid prediction 10/10 Paywall. /r/atheism circa 2012 way → Kind like lived world without cancer cancer appeared. kek no. wont watch cases suspected US first recorded case Wuhan already big issue part 2019 them.

None changes fact started China means lot earlier lying hiding issues China Government. Probably not. I'm sure there's alot people getting tested well. ""I DECLARE AUTONOMY.""

""I wanted know can't say word ""autonomy"" expect anything happen.""

""I say it. declared it."" Yeah get impression like free speech, people can’t separate business government. 

Should government force citizens private property get vaccinated? Hell no

Should business (healthcare anyone) able enforce vaccinations employees and/or customers? Absolutely, it’s fucking property Us breaking new ground today's news Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine approved use UK I've seen lot talk going around Nobel prizes. I've also seen LOT misconceptions Nobel prize going around. thought would clear couple things. following info Nobel Prize physiology medicine might relevant prizes, like Nobel Peace Prize.

* prize awarded 3 people, max. can't awarded ""every scientist worked developing vaccine,"" I've seen many people say. 

* prize usually awarded many years, decades, discovery made. I've seen people saying they'll ""shocked"" next year's Nobel SARS-CoV2 vaccine. shocked *is*. impossible since science behind vaccine decades making, certainly given. 

* prize almost always awarded developments basic science, applied science like vaccines. Creating working vaccine unlikely earns someone Nobel prize. Contrary speculation many comments I've seen here, lead scientists vaccine development trials unlikely awarded Nobel prize work. 

Given this, Nobel prize given related development COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, scientists whose basic research lead viability mRNA vaccines. mostly likely candidates Katalin Karikó Drew Weissman, scientists UPenn discovered modify synthetic RNA provoke deadly immune response humans. Karikó especially, since championing concept RNA-based medicine since 90s, far every mainstream. also currently board BioNTech, course brought us first ever approved mRNA vaccine. Here's article her: studies published phase 3 results. Nothing would make happier says true, evidence true press releases vaccine companies. hell FDA waiting on? bf Pfizer trial (we're almost certain got real one placebo) felt like shit doses - said second worse. couch day time he's 29 good health. think really need stagger bc going put lot people commission least day. Great job dictator. I’m talking Morons refusing wear mask public spreading contagious disease. I've basically pulled away everything, everybody society whole! quit job restaurant owner 99% staff worn mask. one since beginning wear one. set would isolated time year. Thanksgiving myself, Birthday yesterday went nowhere saw one! alone Christmas too. seen family either knows will. parents 71 risk. sister family Lancaster bad there. People make fun cause views, tell know what, I'll last man standing view this, good luck surviving dumbass! Pa people naive stupid! look away. used afraid shots started problem them. Doctor/Nurse/Pharmacist probably used giving people shots they're practically master giving painlessly. real lockdown eliminated virus 

The chance ""real"" lockdown went away March. ""real"" lockdown stop COVID without measures place, lockdowns magical cure-all people want be. so-called ""half-measures"" keep COVID manageable lockdown ends. Also, consider lockdowns meant end gradually guarantee 180 back normal life.

Too many people look places like NZ Melbourne---which took 3.5 months get 700 cases day, why??--and ignore everything else made lockdowns successful. Texas ""mandatory"" masks enforcement, police might conceivably enforcement sane state refuse wear them, Oh wanted conspiracy theory huh? Well guess what, vaccines make gay! No, im homophobic calling stupid? Maybe declare mask mandate instead Ok interested informed. Also dozens safe vaccines since 197 fucking 6. Stupid fear monger wife's uncle twice. First time mild, second time ICU 2 months. he's oxygen rest life. fairly healthy. Yeah, sounds like annoying talk it, helps shutting future, might help make commit word lol Well, yes.  Red new orange. Would even interesting Population 66 million reference submitted review already US. believe meeting Dec 10th discuss it. exact date hopefully move quickly there. Hardly 'myth' according Tegnell...is still around? can’t suspend me! understand volunteering trials would help much. think accurately count cases / give shit don’t tell people Shouldn’t Cell immunity also factored in? That’s what’s fascinating this. huge ""peaceful"" protests literally every irrelevant thing worst plague century seems going well them. 

No clue people stupid lol. Anti-science agenda. last ""safe"" vaccine gave bunch people uncurable narcolepsy Yes w/ actors wearing masks, social distancing, hand washing, risk quite low. stress it. We'll dead couple decades anyway. astounding fearmongering talking points continue used despite repeatedly debunked. Narrative Uber alles, guess. Seasonality vary depending location. US alone [9 climate states regions tend rise fall time conditions similar. problem people treat US one country, rather 9 regions

For example [here based chart. states rise sync, even though ND MT mask mandates (and NE circumstances), SD WY didn't. peaked around mid-Nov, they're free-fall

I believe New England next region due up, though think Ohio Valley region one hardest hit right exact thing indiana, every pharmacy immeidate care advertising covid tests roadside banners. Still looking like Sweden sharp fuckin decline deaths even rise cases. want revise comment bro? seem little unfair they're asking brother's girlfriend tested. Perhaps negotiate brother ask tested too. Otherwise seem like hill worth dying unless someone household extremely high risk. How? mean vaccine options? Still looking like Sweden sharp fuckin decline deaths even rise cases. want revise comment bro? Almost immediate group stuck working home, made bosses let us team meetings zoom twice month see there's that... based reality. government control approval process whatsoever. UK regulatory bodies highly regarded internationally there’s question manipulated way (or suggestion literally anyone government attempted this). Keir Starmer also welcomed news zero reservations. 

Boris massive majority there’s question ‘clinging power’, he’d fine either way. worst case scenario would compromises rebels coming months. 

The fact UK government response left lot desired seems far they’ve actually done good job terms vaccine acquisition preparation it’s distribution may well redeem extent here. 

It seems like you’re determined hate Conservatives load mental gymnastics convince fantastic news somehow bad. People disagree still good things. rushed review say first... something Russians might do. Oh wait also announced mass vaccinations begin Yep, hard lesson Swedes learn, make mistake Keep middle/ high schools closed. Use spaces special needs/low income/elementary children person learning essential space students better stumbled upon sub checking this. articles seems really fear-morgering, hey that's people want ad money, not. (Hope follow me, read again)

Than read articles, vaccines praised, anti vaxxers shunned, nothing unusual here.

But see people like you, confident opinion changed. I'm reading reply dude. Businesses breaking rules, reply, ridicoulus.

I'm looking this. Well. guy seems know 1 billion businesses apperantly breaking rules, sure.

I hope get sarcasm I'm sure based comment.

You said, dont ridioulus. Right Im sitting coffe, door says: max capacity 20 guest. Looking around 50 us here. Basically full capacity. Okay. guess one business slipped ""ridicoulus"" radar.

Interestingly enough went shopping yesterday thing happened, max capacities respected. hey, guess billion businesses happens found 5 breaks rules.

I could go on, tip iceberg.

But redditors represents site me. life experience. read something belive all. presented facts opposite, rather look post history person rather check facts. downvote call narrow minded. 

But think found narrow minded one. Anyway hope observant things life, now, look like sheep based one comment. Still looking like Sweden sharp fuckin decline deaths even rise cases. want revise comment bro? care people believe hope so, live third world contries always get end short end stick. think getting ""left overs"" first world contries. Get damn politicians war room lock door co-ordinated vaccination everyone bloody one us get theirs. Right people conservative pessimistic. start vaccinating millions month hospitalizations rapidly fall change. Spring realistic. problem case counts different states wildly different testing programs. Deaths easier track harder hide. Unless reason believe COVID substantially deadly Illinois Indiana, Illinois seeing cases. survived lung transplant, Aviptadil. literally says study - patients show dramatic rapid improvement transplantation. I’m sure drug helped, without double lung transplant patient would dead. thought referring story: authors subject magazine? starved SA content U.S., John Ioannidis, epidemiologist professor medicine Stanford University, subjected attacks, hands public officials, fellow scientists. Ioannidis authored cited journal articles medical history praised 2010 article Atlantic possibly “one influential scientists alive.” Yet pilloried published opinion essay expressing concerns lacked data efficacy draconian responses outbreak, lockdowns, measures could cause harms. read obscene defamatory e-mails sent Ioannidis administrators colleagues Stanford. Numerous misleading claims advanced press, including charge financial conflict interest related study prevalence COVID-19 co-authored. fact-finding review external legal firm determined Ioannidis financial conflict. Ioannidis would come fire published analysis showing infection fatality rate COVID-19 far lower initially reported. Later, Centers Disease Control Prevention published similarly low rates (which varied age group, time location) World Health Organization published updated research Ioannidis showing low overall infection fatality rate. That’s actually happening. I’ve eaten fine dining, think sometimes goes fine dining see unimaginable piles dirt serve people it’s “creative” “edgy.” 

Also, can’t believe used piles dirt actual literal reference, figurative. ...and million way. once, living South Ga seen positive. happy together

It’s also hilarious everyone dramatically says “forEVER” “for YEARS”. “I’m staying locked FOREVER [when literally one currently “locked down” US] wearing mask years, need virus COMPLETELY eradicated within two months!” Come on. entitled unrealistic.

Diabetes, asthma, overweightness, etc.......none death sentences (they decrease quality life, people live normal life spans.) idea people ""just going die anyway"" disgusting. weren't. died people spreading COVID. I’m certain this, Although phase 3 clinical trials designed determine whether vaccinated individuals protected disease, also important understand whether vaccinated individuals less likely transmit virus. likely ensured. discussion this, another heard doctor say possible 100 million American could infected covid Jan. reach herd immunity levels still, 100 million Americans truly get infected, it'll decrease R0 Covid spread less. mean late December? Prior reading several comments, clear `French Laundry Party` sure sounded `kinky`.

North Carolina I've tested twice far absolutely free.

I insurance, even ask insurance info. question Vaccine manufacturing.

At beginning pandemic, reported Bill Gates spending lot money building factories production coronavirus vaccines became available. 

What status project, Gates producing millions doses vaccines? making vaccines (pfizer, moderna, etc). main reason expecting fairly widespread distribution vaccine quickly? Okay, evict tenants sit house year sell profit. make profit investment I'd evil land lord right? 

Be honest, matter happened want come financial loss. comes coronaviruss thing seems like absolute perfect virus. 

This thing spreads like wildfire, reasonably high mortality rate, long lasting effects may kill even ""recovered"". 

This thing perfect weapon bed used one. indeed developed naturally nature impressive scary time. believe see it. We're bombarded deaths hospitalizations human ailment daily basis like Covid becomes bit disorienting scary new uptick.

As result, easy lose sight fact people die every day big numbers regardless pandemic affected population elderly many may passed year regardless.  remember much skepticism vaccine prospects last year Reddit.

I kind miss print journalism 😢 justify wearing mask “other people don’t.” It’s stupid. know dumb. Wisconsin cdc put paper explaining 7 day quarantines cover 70% cases. Summer camp outbreak started 1 case turned 110 one case popped 7 day quarantine. China made similar claims. 21 day quarantines catch 99% infected Cases rise Korea. Soooo say pet theory? would assume employer would want us get town public health department would give us site I’m assuming going arrange own. don’t even give us flu shots anymore Nope, got told stfu shared info May.

Wait till register reside sperm even still testing negative recovering. Wellll, ya gonna do? way predict this. link 30,000? long ago receive vaccine? says who? need vaccinate healthcare workers can't spread patients asymptomatic, sick work. 30,000 people half football game. making good logical argument.

Antivaxxers arent taking reasons vaccines.

I’m talking nurses want want take safe. Considering weve forced work little ppe testing 9 months earned right choose whether want later. problem here. Yes it’s almost new.. Good points actually. know least one person fence getting one initial doses reasons came around it. like tower defense game. One baddie every minutes towers take out, super easy, barely inconvenience. Zerg rush, though? Game over. bet ass enforced here. Still, sadly, effect really meager. simultaneously giggled groaned reading this. stable mental health mood feels time now. can't believe shit going year already There's reason smell wearing mask filters viral particles. fact see breath mean mask nothing.

Either way, mask protocols also call social distancing, catch close infectious masked person. they're unmasked enclosed space, infect many people. morons eating restaurants unmasked might well even give shit. China used military lock roads Wuhan. Everyone left city lockdown undergo strict quarantines.

(China isolate positive cases hospitals even asymptomatic)  Well didnt asian culture part face mask usage. exact way around. wish believed strong majority people reasonable would take common sense measures. implies emerged earlier thought, no-one sensible seriously suggesting Wuhan Lung emerged anywhere China. right, could consider national service program national guard normal times, though. return Pierson doctrine aggressively involved humanitarian interventionism via UN could wonders Canada's international standing. Stipulate state pay post-secondary education anyone signs national service something.

There lots variables consider. Compare IL data nearby region - WI, IA, MO, etc. looks better do.

Please lump us together. us like that. Yes, exactly sort. also covert virtue signalers wear mask, go party go back home, potentially exposing family something could kill That’s field statistics medicine work. null generally doesn’t work. That’s studies show do. Otherwise all? 

There large randomized trials showing works. can’t assume does. absence study proof works.

The answers much simpler - Autumn came. People returned vacations went back working studying, general started spending time indoors, Winter came called even time indoors close contact people.

It's free. socialism. benefit paid tax dollars, nobody worry. We're lower cumulative case count world. 

-Donald Trump answering Russell's Paradox. 6 days since holiday Tuesdays typically highest day reporting.

Also hospitalization data fluctuate holiday/weekend. literally many people hospitalized. wait til holiday weekend hospitalized. let people leave holidays. 

It's actually stunning explain Someone know going covid crisis. family got together Thanksgiving. person dined started feeling day. passed away day ago. older really age. infected. take virus seriously, like everyone, took liberties. hope people learn repeat mistakes upcoming holidays. No? mean? Wait... thought reason keep kids school would permanently harmed loss schooling...

But workload high... fuck them? Congratulations UK capitalist way US hospital systems operated, almost hospitals staffed 80% capacity maximum. theory hospital reaches 80% capacity call hospitals area borrow extra staff need. even hire traveling nurses needed.

This work pandemic find hospitals need staff hospitals can't loan out.

This see hospital administrators interviewed versus medical staff see disconnect. Doctors nurses start freaking closer get 80% capacity Administrators say everything fine. Alright let’s get rolling . Covid-19 days numbered!!!! always believed biggest threat humans drug resistant bacteria virus. case directed human civilization past revolutions. fact evolutionary theory suggest plant mRNA, possibly multicell organism's mitochondria came bacteria genes. great day!! Let's hope works well let's us lives back UK around world. wife carer already told ordered. Thank scientists medical teams.

Obviously March Twitter user posted spreadsheet cases reporter days/weeks advance nailed them.

Believe want dude. proof needed started games there.

Reality literally whatever choose believe right now. plenty people stuck reality Covid isn’t real, way deathbed virus takes - mentioned article posted days ago.

Ultimately, whatever believe choice. gave providing proof people long time ago. Self education holds weight gold, especially now. safe there. Whats maximum ICU capacity US thinking tgey handle? someone explain take matter hours UK approve, EMA take entire month review? [Serious question] Ask New Zealand Yeah. doubts vaccine. Like Moderna suddenly get something working failed 10 years business?

But stakes high disease. Literally millions dying. think small percentage people get, example GBS, vaccine, society may willing take risk. 

On individual level, debilitating side effects terrible, one guarantee happen. Stick island, problem solved. way live lives live lives useless information.

God bless America. /s  Probably next week so. I've gathered EMA Health Canada pretty much working together. Yay Science! proud scientists worked hard this.  Go science!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Think biggest priority minimise deaths, targeting vulnerable. seems like kind havent started throwing fists yet. divide unreal. That's different leaving house though. leave house without going indoors elsewhere Truly historic achievement :(( I'm cashier grocery store working years, including pandemic. anyone know odds getting vaccine year are? I'm risk person far know, worry older family members. chance I'm included essential workers part this? Canada way many start giving away summer. taken seriously think worry much. best do. can’t stop yourself. hopefully /s? Canada order 10 doses every citizen. bound fuck bunch. Please tell including small walks like count  Shock Doctrine time, baby Well yet. scene Frodo climbing mount doom seeing river fire  could swap? ;) r/choosingbeggers

The vulnerable get first rightly Still struggling find data vaccine, wild claims ones producing it.

I want believe, absence public information it, getting hard. mean last checked science said immunity antibodies might recovering gone 3 months addition lasting lung damage guy mentioned blood clots they're finding organs people already died.

You know pick getting vaccine getting covid, getting 3 months later I'd jump vaccine.  Great news. evolved thought. UK bought 300 million doses intent distributing excess 3rd world countries. Answer probably existing infrastructure equipment. takes time stand something compatible parts processes assuming even order need supplier backlogged. 

Point 2, need let's say next 8 months take 6 stand full production rates, probably bad capital investment completely redundant afterwards. I'd imagine new lines need certified top training employees, etc. difficult around. seems though old key workers get vaccine first. completely agree key workers protected first, argument say active members society get vaccine old? people think?

Once vaccinate likely spread virus, relatively young social people society, measures place protect old, key workers vaccinated + protocols minimise spread, wouldn’t better society whole? I.e. better mental health people, better economic impact, etc within letter law clearly violated intent horrible optics learned older people live lives separated rest us virus could wildly control among youngin's matter. know  Apparently linking correct sub gets comment removed.

So let instead say spelled ""Leopards"". ""Ate Face"". /r/ front. Wow showed headline April...❤️ consulting doctors phone. prescribing medicine things necessary. people mild symptoms advised home isolation doctors. however situation worsens, immediately go hospital.

According heat map republicans almost states. election fraud! Nah- don’t need it. Gov. Shit called day fasting prayer Thursday. work. article updated seems easier see meant.

According source, earlier estimate seems wrong. 

If source accurate, China's response still bad, never allowed researchers find patient zero original animal. political choice, world hate China forever it. UK 100% country. American here. I've heard before, get microwave thing stove either? would thought tea kettle stove would old school fairly ""British"". curious. LETS F\*\*\*\*\*G GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! We're first country world approve Pfizer vaccine, feels good man. Although also highest number deaths Europe, kind need ASAP.  Ummm...  CHRISTMAS?!? Pfizer moderna vaccines don’t prevent transmission, symptoms. don’t hear talked enough. We’re vaccinating millions people unless everybody starts talking now, millions people thinking vaccine enables return life normal. super dangerous, people aren’t going get vaccinated time, exposure getting vaccinated first. seems like recipe disaster.

Apparently astra-Zeneca vaccine also reduces transmission. seen expected EU timeline?  Frodo done gif perfect Great news! 99% chance FDA approve Pfizer/BionTech vaccine.

If get approved, HUGE surprise. Well here’s terrifying rabbit hole really hope get vaccinated thanksgiving/christmas/new years covidmania. December great start! That’s thought. Prior covid, heard regards measles vaccinations antivaxers messing herd immunity immunocompromised. Goooo UK! feels like race! Hoping Canada follows suit soon! entire comment thread started comment talking 50+ year olds buddy. brought ""elderly"" like 2 comments ago.

And even 70+ year olds interact lot everyone else, even comparatively less younger people. shop, see families. large minority still works. cities take bus subway.

We national call travel kill grandma grandpa thanksgiving. Vaccinate 70% 70 year olds, remaining 30% still safely go thanksgiving example. store. could meet Bingo. That's sole improvement. 1. Americans higher rate COVID infections Canadians. movement restrictions make sense. 
2. Restrictive border policies extremely popular many countries.

Combine two extremely popular policy. Exactly, rural Nevada hospital capacity speak. close sending people Reno, currently putting people parking garage retrofitted hospital. hope god every day end needing hospital visit. Sad part Vaccines us Third world countries get like 2 - 3 years. rich countries bought them. hope someone step disperse equally. getting medical treatment doctor telephone. giving meds prescribed doctors necessary things one usually case flu. Steam, gargles, vitamin C suppliments Etc. sugar level giving complex carbs lot proteins diet. hospital situation, since many people infected covid, beds available. even get admitted hospital, lack care, food, worsen situation. trying best taking care home. Ah yes that's exception. meant home. UK’s vaccine approval process streamlined related laws place yet necessarily. perhaps wants test offer governments option example one dose 75% efficiency two doses 93% efficiency. sure many countries perhaps poor countries choose former. English tea mediocre Yeah. thing science is, never afraid wrong. same. 

There huge surges across country last 2-3 weeks. started right around time went dinner ,but became worse course days weeks. 

Let tell Thanksgiving different. First, huge surges cases 1-2 weeks before, actually much dangerous time. Second, Thanksgiving lot people travel across country planes, airports, etc. hell lot dangerous driving 1.5 hours outside county neighboring county car. Third, Thanksgiving everyone gathers families DAY. million times dangerous people seeing family there, scattered time. people tend sit *indoors*, masks entire time, spending days many hours (not 1-2 hours), often times elderly family members involved. 

Timing important, time, Mayor Breed allowed see family like anyone else allowed to. nothing wrong taking calculated risks pandemic, long take precautions. always wears masks careful outside instance. see family often go fancy dinners regular basis. 

Americans asked sacrifice time friends family throughout pandemic. last 1-2 weeks, prior surges. that, long took precautions, allowed. main guidance careful, see family time, wear masks, take precautions. even heard Dr. Fauci talking risks/benefits visiting family. Nobody said it, specific shutdowns. otherwise...it weighing risks benefits taking proper precautions. 

Not sure seen family many times pandemic. time outside, masks, distanced. one time sat eat family outside another friends outside cafe. really careful sit far table wear masks eating. also otherwise careful outside situations generally home sanitize everything avoid people. Therefore, think anything wrong. think done. Problem many people going every day, seeing family every day, wearing masks, taking proper precautions, seeing different groups people week, etc. black white. middle ground. Soon. like matters anyway next 8 months big vax anyway FDA tends strictest review process (from )
I sat entire meeting. important understand meeting determines vaccine allocated one approved FDA.  


FYI: three sub-sections Phase 1 release. Phase 1a vaccinate health care personnel long term care facility residents staff. Phase 1b vaccinate ""essential workers"" education, food &amp; agriculture, utilities, Police, Firefighters, on. Phase 1c vaccinate adults high-risk medical conditions adults 65+.  


Also note, discussed sub-prioritization discussed prioritization within categories exception Long Term Care Facilities residents staff treated equally simply easier vaccinate everyone facility once.

Edit:
Instead potato screen shots slides.

Regardless, limits market scale do. fact trials pretty much dismissed severe outcomes Placebo group. ADE major issue would expect that. power influence sort things out, chose political gain still continuing so.

He jail. stories published? People shouldn’t fear vocal minority refuse listen science reason sure case example, immune system weak can't vaccines (may cases can't too). people, UK least, antibody treatments It’s water.

Or sugar.

That’s it.

It’s effective anything, courts permitting peddled supplement similar US.

But it’s garbage one waste time money. B r u h

Same. UR Rochester regional system? Exactly. shocking we've normalized deaths infections. It'll ""not big deal"" we're ""down"" 200 deaths day 50000 infections per day. countries shut fuck 10% values. mean exactly? % covid patients diabetes died vs recovered? anti science? That’s capitalism. idea app measure. set ""risk tolerance"" 0.1. units given. mean?? 0.1 chances (=10%) somebody get covid okay? Obviously depends prevalence covid population, that's even input app??

I idea Im looking website abysmal job explaining it. like onion article headline, it’s real life imagine eventual US priority list look lot like this. It’s certainly cheapest easiest distribute 3 announced results phase 3 trial yes, trial run poorly, lead questions corners cut. 

I doubt approved USA based completed trial result. likely won’t even apply permission new trial completed. Thanks, Diaper Don! thought virus would recognize invisible lines jurisdictions? 

The people think hoax masks lead socialism.

73 million y'all. Let sink in. Memes, ah memes.

**Mission Accomplished**
Respect+ 2021 finna comeback kid. Exactly, I'm fucking baffled. Like, get it, vaccine trials ended disaster, looking YEARS lock downs distancing, might really tempted say fuck it, what's going happen going happen.

But trials turned better expected! gave scientists manufacturing engineers logistics chain experts impossible task said ""fuck impossible, imma it"" it! close able roll vaccine could literally save world, instead population saying ""Thanks heroes, we're going part stay inside away friends family like, another 6 months throw ticker tape parade"" saying ""yeah, fuck that, let's see ensure whole population gets COVID time vaccine rolled make efforts useless"".

Fuck this, longer indefinite problem, virus shelf life, let's small part protect many people possible shit. dozens mRNA vaccine candidates various stages development. new, new people think. Moderna made mRNA vaccine Zika, human trials started back 2017, reports safety issues far. vaccine booster together make 20 million vaccines stock? Even without Brexit, could've approved vaccine EMA. think UK got option independently approve medication couple years ago.

Also, bit shame Pfizer asked EU approval yesterday. Hope EMA manages reach quick decision. Every second matters... Thanksgiving last week, meaning people got infected big family gatherings likely starting show symptoms right now. 

If way predict get-togethers spread diseases... /s Avengers: Endgame, would moment Cap hears Falcon's voice. nations world approve vaccines, good guys emerge portals. There's still big fight ahead (i.e. winter), victory horizon inevitable. ""stimulus"" close second, would imagine. feel sorry lose lives Guinea pigs new world order see higher death toll virus Oxford dead patient? leaving open safe things much possible large portion population going stay home. close everything break rules host home based parties whatever.

Unless go wuhan style actually strictly enforce stay home (we shouldn't) messaging important actual rules. closing outdoor dining confuses messaging going meet someone outside household, outside. Instituting measures avoid spread COVID holidays reasonable man. Like except government super spreader even? fear happen oppose masks become even vocal. work High School classroom.

Yep! dark bitter cold get work. dog I'd go right home covers watch TV time year. frustrating issue, somehow people forgotten we're lockdowns social distancing, etc. narrative turned *deadly* virus (or isn't).

It's never that, always transmissible keeping number infections down. Yes virus pretty low mortality rate, that's point. point is, left unchecked, virus would infect massive numbers people completely overwhelm healthcare facilities. 

That's deaths would start creeping up, people start dying home hospital parking lots beds available. death rate low we're trying prevent spread... let run rampant death rate would much higher, serious complications would much widespread, impact society would even worse - even catch it.

The morons go deadly flu oversimplifying issue missing point entirely. Yeah, free Yay! 400k people live unknown side effects! Amazing! among us clever... namely myself. protein folding would benefit us? leaving open safe things much possible large portion population going stay home. close everything break rules host home based parties whatever.

Let's forget weird love Brian Houston Hill$ong church feel like somehow possible people put back office rolls *right* people?

The response pandemic bizarre. care smart enough act properly even care. way waves organised leads overwhelming majority receiving vaccine first women (given massive preponderance women older age groups, NHS etc 75% + female). one seems factored fact men around twice likely die get it. would relatively simple do. left wondering would received women likely die yet men front queue vaccination. Lmao, fuck off. country give shit ""carona"" USA. literally best teams yet failed. failure cause deaths states also indirectly affect countries. Boring Pfizer. Moderna vaccine different numbers both. Phoebe said responding someone specifically said ""everyone wants relocate allowed to."" Anyone ohio free leave means will. Obviously everyone means they're trapped they're ""allowed"" leave. I’m gonna wait years see long term negative side effects I’ll take it.

I hear time. amazing many people drink, eat shitty diet, exercise, fat, sleep enough, etc. suddenly concerned thier long term health.

There less evidence long term effects vaccine COVID has. take minute admire fucking amazing science is. last 9 months shit (probably everyone else) got excited seeing this, even US citizen, anything I've seen literally years Fascism nationalist version Socialism whereas Communism classist form Socialism. people understand ones whose understanding Socialism comes someone like AOC (whose policies Socialist). Yeah annoys Reddit, many people keep saying hearing November onwards cannot true. hear least mid January.  Bushfires ravage country.

That's one small example 100, could pull. No, MHRA still working EU laws still place end year. UK managed approve faster EU body would wait joined EU-wide scheme.

Contact-tracing involves testing large number people, usually getting high number negatives catching smaller number positives.

If people pay that, government control infection.

The true travel etc (more countries demand negative test, older 72 hours upon arrival destination-country). 


Also, people may suspect infected, symptoms, refrain testing themselves, spreading disease further, potentially killing older relatives etc.

Testing cost-free, matter what, serious stopping this. bring tears eyes. 🙏 threshold herd immunity different different diseases. also isn’t achieved vaccination alone. summer 40% Americans could naturally acquired COVID antibodies. Medical workers nursing home residents. 

Nursing home residents make large percentage deaths, population million people. 

There enough doses entirety population least first dose arm first week January. (Though yes, logistics challenge rural areas). 

Immunity isn’t binary. It’s like 2 weeks second shot still zero immunity, suddenly week later full immunity. 

I agree February death rate going way way up. said “by end February” death rate way down. I’m way. get two shots... anxiety highhhh. Odds covid. Odds even covid coworker catch it. Odds even either catch fine. posted whole FAQ, lol. absolutely right unknown risks associated vaccine, safe 100,000 volunteers 100% guarantee going safe everyone, much higher known risks associated virus, know dice would rather roll. long term effects:

1. Long term effects modern vaccination much thing, ones I'm aware couple issues may may linked H1N1 vaccines, namely type nerve problem called GBS type sleep disorder called narcolepsy, extremely rare, vaccine trigger them, manifest within 2-3 months, max. ""effects years road"" never observed, despite lot monitoring.

2. mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines believed significantly safer traditional vaccines, deliver Covid signature spike whole dead virus like H1N1 flu vaccines (The flu vaccine might possibly trigger GBS/narcolepsy flu able trigger GBS/narcolepsy, vaccine supposed mimic infection, times immune system over-reacts). spike vaccines lot targeted, much less likely over-stimulate immune system cause neurological issues.

3. fair skeptics, mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines relatively new, know way cause problems mean risk free. However, general public expected get vaccinated next spring, nearly year data first batch volunteers. I’m sure statistics (kids generally spared) mean absolutely nothing poor family now.. feel horrible Trump hereby declare AOC Category renamed DJT Category. Yah actually remember reading reddit late November "" mysterious type new pneumonia seen wuhan"" Perhaps... reported New Year's Eve. small (everyone thought time) contained then, possible cases outside China far back last November seems unlikely everyone online who's *convinced* covid last year actually did.

* Western Europe awaiting sources 90% population. stupid question every vaccine maker going try making release formula?

Most vaccine makers either setting supply chains different parts world licencing companies make themselves. really 'release formula' vaccines hard long would take reach 50 group everything goes right?

In UK leaked timetable suggested 50s may start receiving vaccines end January bulk March everyone offered time frame linked either sucess rate vaccine manufacturing time?

Both, linked many vaccines get authorised time. big one Oxford vaccine cheap, easy manufactoring loads idea fast manufacture vaccines reach asia?

No idea imagine slow, particularly lots vaccines get approved. hate true might ring... Since know reason I'll spend time blaming country country maskless neighbors. That's effective.

After spending time Africa, Bill Gates said biggest regret life didn’t start project earlier. Bill Melinda Gates Foundation involved aspects vaccination, research, manufacture, distribution. involved South America well Africa.

Alright, let’s project many covid deaths December. There’s 7,000 deaths far, say 600 months. brings us 4,000 less last year. course, need factor deaths causes well. 7,000 deaths per months aren’t covid. Projecting December, brings total deaths count year somewhere near 91,000. 3,000 last year. year unprecedented attempts keeping people safe healthy pandemic kinds trickle effects numbers.

I don’t see evidence that. You’re saying 7,000 people killed due covid, extra safety measures saved what, 3,000 people would’ve died otherwise? number deaths including covid isn’t far normal numbers, least enough make much difference. No, ""he's"" right neither you. 


The point assume one covid chance covid consequences great risk, don't, loss immaterial(despite whiny entitled connecting isolation kinds horrors) One thing bothers me, aren’t doing, people attack unemployed reason. It’s fault unemployed ones employer pays shit. That’s issue entrenched contradictions capitalism. Didnt apply approval somewhere today? Main reason I'll glad get end weirdo comparisons calculations.

What works lot better actually write specific evidence post. make snopes first link post, make first link (which show up) something leads first-order evidence. example, link statement royal college clarifying Dr. Hodkinson chair: 

Basically, easy call Snopes liar impersonal target. *you* debunk copying snopes' work, they'd call liar, link snopes' evidence dispute that, specific ammunition for. They've said ""snopes deepstate"" million times, they've never heard royal college before, ""They're bad guys"" fall back on.

Once virus spreads far enough population, containment becomes practically impossible, happened U.S. western europe. U.S. lockdowns, UK lockdowns, virus everywhere.

At point, herd immunity thing stop pandemic, want let entire population infected, means vaccines.

""I want take 1 million chance side effects"" excuse anyone going accept. describing double blind. Yep! going happening everywhere careful. include holiday travel. Scary! Self-care friend. important. Focusing favorites- fix favorite foods, play favorite game, favorite hobby, marathon favorite movies, lounge around favorite comfortable clothes. 

If think lift spirits consider volunteering. guarantee shelter, kitchen charity may desperately need idle hands. act bringing little good world interacting people trying help others might give mental health needed boost. get test? cant blame frustration, worked due pandemic cause essential worker. went lot everyone going tough time.. gotta hope best expect worse prepare keep moving try forget past. first time realised Moderna RNA name 😆 I'm slow  Canada bought enough vaccines vaccinate everybody like 10 times idea distributing rest world done. largest vaccine production company world India. World leaders realize citizens safe whole world safe. Countries stepping in. Can't worse side-effects suffocating death covid. Give vaccine day week. Blessed ~~peacemakers~~ **leakers**

\~Matthew 5:9 course trust west rest, guys clue lucky yet keep bashing west possibilities west gives you. never argued schools open anything moronic. reiterate, number people killed (mostly churchgoing) morons want keep schools open free daycare economy, absolve churches guilt people *the churches killing.* New Zealand zero cases. summer. lol ""you're triggered"" says triggered yes.  theaters yes.  I'm NYC, went full-K\*\*\*n.  could done way states. I've saying since beginning. Spot on. lot individual life insurance policies require physical exam. COVID significant damage, doctors would find anyways exam insurance company would still decline policy raise premium compensate. Prison, IDK. jails absolutely get priority.

Many people held pretrial, determination guilt yet. Many people held driving suspended license, shoplifting, homeless people trespassing charges.

With jails government forcibly taking away opportunity take steps avoid virus. Social distancing, no. Mask wearing, no. even quarentine sick people local jail, stick em everyone else inside enclosed area. joke.

And even leaving moral part out. big driver pandemic. jails, unlike prisons, people booked miasmal cesspool, handful days (just enough time sure infection) released general public time. Turnover high. friend generally immune compromised medicine takes chrons disease. time fly’s (even pre covid times) wears mask, wipes seat buckle sanitizing wipes, generally really anal safety. She’s fly work says it’s actually safest she’s ever felt since everyone else same. Obviously it’ll stay way people continue cautious, it’s definitely possible travel safe. Unfortunately couple jerks ruin everyone! even read linked, conveniently using source explains better could. Feel free read it. Meanwhile friends passing around “how legally decline vaccine” posts. fucking mouth breathers them. never expected this, going work?....is.....is end???? protecting football team anything. Lock ones risk, maybe money world, mouths feed. Obviously mass casualty permanent disability vaccine side effects worldwide despair watch basement, commenting threads told so. Sarcasm obviously. year acceptable timeline you? gonna choice another 5 months probably pretty pointless thing say anyway. four mink farms left. Mink farming prohibited starting spring 2021 Netherlands, many many cases covid-19 infected mink farms. Tbf 1st lockdowns probably reduced statistics show

But testing capacity obviously bottleneck getting cases reported.  world may great achievement America stuborn brainwashed make happen. Dec 14th wife's health system. course depends location. also depends measure. plenty beds, technically. don’t enough healthcare workers take care people. Meh. think blatantly lied anywhere. cares anyways. I'm avatar internet.

The main point trying make early science know immunity, long-term effects, COVID are.

Time tell, always does. locked beginning, sense others lose everything worked for. ""and play us out.... mean? 'to play us out'. F*ck it! We'll live!"" reason rush approval. vaccine made Belgium. December can’t get across border case no-deal Brexit. wonder deciding go ahead defy county officials take upon enforce state mandates? I'm sure story would blown media had. give evidence people transmit virus less due vaccines?

I keep asking that, evidence. makes sense true. that's science works. Australia New Zealand. Pretty big countries. Zero cases without vaccine.

No one antivaxx here. Russia released Sputnik vaccine, many us rushed take it?

Confidence testing important. AstraZeneca messed trials big time. SII sued volunteer!! details transverse myelitis still released.

No one vaccines. fact still wish Pfizer vaccine available India  Even get one, wait times like now? Especially holiday morons thrown mix? No, not. Go back reread beginning. Slowly.

* People strong immune systems clear virus faster weak immune systems proven

* vaccine increases immune response. proven 

Therefore probable vaccinated people clear virus faster unvaccinated people.

This proven case viruses well, making even likely. You’re going get much support Reddit extremely eager get jabbed. want get lives view getting Covid worse vaccine. It’s fine feel way, nobody downvoted questioning vaccine. vaccine face mask side effects. Every person needs weigh risks decide themselves. hate everything cigars, see would unappealing me. I’ve also never wanted briny earthy dessert flavor, see saying. Interesting hear different perspective. literally caused global extinction event letting businesses run free, majority humans alive today live countries exploited said businesses.

You beliefs actively compromising future whole species. Congratulation, threat individuals around you, also individuals yet born. Definitely everyone. Dallas pretty serious majority people actually dense. Wow.

By logic hospitalization numbers remained flat since one compiles stats working. However, hospitalization numbers *decreased* since then. daily count new hospitalizations. 

How hospitalizations numbers decrease? really likely statisticians job mysteriously numbers drop, than, know, less people hospital coronavirus? mother caught covid recently handled really well. going OK? can't handle anything happening her... Perhaps misread took 60,000 IU 7 days got confirmation 

as confirmation tested positive.

Anyways, country currently docs prescriptions SARS-CoV-2 vaccines? Dolly Parton too. Sometimes little [perspective wonders. temporary. I’m curious I’ve seen enough crazy shit year Good grief. isn’t political sub. Yikes. know difference that's completely irrelevant here. 

Ioannidis's IFR based faulty study Santa Clara lower total COVID fatality rate NYC (COVID deaths/population city) time published it.

He deserved every bit criticism received. People dying drinking hand sanitizer natural selection work governor fact following rules, lockdown. hard. 

Napa Yellow, allowed indoor dining. went dining indoors. realize become favored talking point Newsom something illegal, something stupid. used super socially anxious stuff like that... specifically remember going concert, even though mom offered buy tickets, scared I’d get judged. super excited change actually stuff 2020... couldn’t totally different reason. 

Now, can’t wait get stuff it’s safe so, never thought I’d look forward leaving house past! insurance companies denying know enough long-term risks COVID-19 survivors. companies know risk, can't calculate appropriate premiums reserves they'll need pay claims still remain solvent company. know everyone likes paint insurance companies evil, denials reasonable know long term health costs denials probably decrease learn COVID survivors. think trial involved 100 children aged years 12 15. No. data reviewed. right know data months emergency authorization. tests followed large cohort volunteers. respect WHO. April 6, World Health Organization released new guidance saying healthy people need wear face masks prevent coronavirus spread."" someone gets vaccinated, primary benefit society whole secondary benefit individual.

To me, inmates priority seems obvious.

A difficult question ""should inmates right refuse vaccination?"" think not. health care system collapse. everything else said pretty agreeable, health care system probably strained ever going back March

Who telling that? March localized overloading issues, primarily Michigan, New York, Chicago, major international links. hot spots benefitted additional doctors nurses coming support ramping response regions hit all.

This winter starting everywhere once. cavalry coming everyone needs additional staff. don't, within next six weeks.

The USA going crest 100K hospitalizations week. March/April July never got much 60K. Strange photographer catch moment. strange. [mRNA vaccines studied seen statistics? France significantly anti-vaccine US. 

Also, states highest vaccine rates general? Mississippi West Virginia. I’m confused everything I’m seeing, vaccine given medical workers? saw article said “on Tuesday head CDC votes” another says “vaccine yet approved” 

I would like know expect next weeks 😅 Unless they're talking climate miss shopping stores. husband made mistake going Total Wine random Tuesday morning. maybe four people shopping entire store. yet stood register paying, one people got line right me, completely ignoring social distancing stickers. September, good 6 months pandemic. knew better. care. 

I go another store I've vaccine help experience. curbside Amazon Fresh. percentage supplements metabolised? increase much supplements metabolised? anything, pants less essential masks right now. hate em, big enough deal start pants freedom movement sit Subway underwear. Plus winter balls would get cold, that's point...

Masks proven way reduce risk public, mandating reasonable prudent measure slow spread. Protest absurd people ridiculed position every opportunity. need vaccinate 100% people reach herd immunity. threshold estimation herd immunity covid 60-75% according wikipedia. question is, many people vaccinated justified continue normal lives? I'd imagine number bit lower percentile ""complete herd immunity"". could reached easily even approval 18 population. 

Just thought, means well educated enough draw conclusions this, even said correct, doubt well. children going last. soon approved vaccine no-go 18. working vaccine teenagers ready couple months. take much longer younger children.

It highly likely adult prisoners vaccinated babies. even conceivable babies wait age higher age group get vaccinated. Encephalitis affects 1 100,000 people per year. Given people enrolled vaccine trials around world, we'd expect one case encephalitis one now.

We're hitting point illness subsequent vaccine administration going blamed vaccine, nobody ever gets sick tests extended? even larger group selected probability possible underlying conditions caused studied?

Yeah that's emergency use authorization, next test group going health care providers. effectively large ""phase 4"" study.

You can't throw brakes vaccine distribution, time selecting larger group test subjects. Depends location. NYC instance 1-2 million people infected early May, even end really using field hospitals. saw nothing pointing direction bashing UK, mention approvals done similar timelines political race first, like Russia did.

And pretty obvious, immunization done similar timelines, yet another window virus persist.

If UK intention first western countries political reasons, ridiculous dangerous.  Omg grow 🙄 No. It’s still happening. sure think it’s not. but... I’m Astros fan pandemic made realize much humans really social creatures. need groups New study finds alcohol-free hand sanitizer stops COVID-19 well

It say ""stops SARS-CoV-2"" (the virus). COVID-19 disease cannot directly spread. I'm long distance relationship (other country) seen since February 2020 playing fly January 2021 taking extra precautions getting airBnB quarantine.. fly responsibly CFR != IFR live rock? Look new zealand singapore. open supermarkets essential jobs beat virus. I'm guilty good sir/madam. never ever downvote answers commets posts Yes, think simultaneously done. No, Rosicrucian. Completely control. 
Will magically get better. love organizer contrite holding convention now. mystified could thought good idea. There’s vaccine widespread distribution it’s over. distribution work UK? like everything pandemic, us folk US get watch countries show us it’s done hoping get sense exactly it’s going trickle out, issues may arise, mask use certain area gets vaccine, etc.

Judging countless articles discussions, I’m guessing normal plan would get health care workers vaccine first, risk, essential workers, general population? health care workers mad rush everyone else? always want hope best know us states tend fuck basic stuff, testing PPE.

Regardless distribution done, I’m also interested see guidelines/orders/etc. done certain area vaccine live. everyone away it? keep month sure go buck wild? need certain vaccine certificate enter someplace hear may case flying? device test Covid vaccine business use? Another area feel want hope best know potential clusterfuck, perhaps first months later months we’ll back sense security flu vaccine gave us about. Let’s talk mental illness let tell you, chronic conditions take toll.

Can't imagine chronic illness good ""mental illness"" Maybe more. Back women got married late teens started children right away. pill didn’t come along 1960. 102 year old mom would easily 80-something child. women also kept kids, daughter could also 70-something. Hard think life kids happen, ready not. None makes difference. That's New England starting spike despite people much likely comply restrictions.

 ""they got first"" excuse going apply now. People going eventually wake realise like coronaviruses, one seasonal No, moderate independents. time, I've grown liberal, conservative. second thoughts, politics small part life together. live Denmark.

We one toughest responses initially, kept somewhat stable level lockdown, allowed lockdowns widespread countries gotten stage panic. year ass-backwards find googling ""can get horse sneezes"" here's actual Yahoo News article instead Independent article Proteins ""machines"" cells. They're used basically everything. They're extremely versatile, used catalysts reaction think of(meaning less heat needed reaction), split molecules sorts stuff really tiny scale.

The problem they're pain design, proteins really know make ones copy living thing evolved them. fold 3 dimensions fold changes depending elements them, order elements they'd previously folded. Making really really difficult predict they'll fold hence design new ones.

If properly crack protein folding might able make proteins break toxins efficiently, even start make(extremely simple) living organisms, maybe even able to(eventually, maybe 100-200 years) get scale bacteria. could make artificial bacteria break toxins engineering instead wait evolve. people need jobs food. Covid warriors Trump. Die another loser. /s Yeah also someone else saying animal human trials time usually never special circumstances, enough sample size trials it’s prevalent communities. MNRA technology they’ve working decade trials SARS one ended successful disappeared. wish government would properly prepared actually vaccinate. foresee months told must get vaccine people struggle actually get appointments get it. like testing. contrast long covid would randomly passing walking bedroom kitchen 6 months later, heart palpitations drink one cup coffee despite drinking 5-6 day before, athletic going hikes depression barely get car trailhead without getting tired.... yeah there’s difference I'm personal friend feel like knew back April..are relearning again? wonder got caught, glad though.. know people recently Thanksgiving.. Last time saw music ~355ish days ago. Wu-Tang 
Dead &amp; Co shows got canceled. Yup. Everytime I've brought subject vaccines rushed production, I'm downvoted oblivion, accused anti-vaxxer. 

The fact remains Pfizer Moderna vaccines fundamentally new type vaccine (mRNA new vaccine tech), could well yet unidentified effects, pretty much anybody frontlines, may risk worth taking. Might well wait years watch unintended consequences getting vaccinated. Okay, 90% success rate one age 55 trial. full dose them, 70% efficacy. Also I'm pretty sure 90% efficacy rate based low sample size. dont reach 15,000 new cases safety measures place. 
 
As far know, downplayed virus far long anything stick deniers now. vaccines available already name written label. USA, CAN, EU, UK on. name thhey already paid, already sold formal contracts. really think Pfizer made something race? One death tragedy. thousand deaths statistic 😔  alternative don’t lock country let people go work, insist sick elderly stay home let young able bodied make living.

And people 50-70 still elevated risk, still work can't afford retire? younger people immunocompromised? member household high risk? 

Even high-risk people isolated long-term care homes, they're still dying thousands workers homes get sick outside work bring virus in. 

Trying isolate vulnerable work. going weird places fully vaccinated others even hitting threshold significantly reduce spread. 

There's ethical way it, wonder extent reserving health care vaccinated (or be) would change that. One way another vaccine refusers need bear cost decision. it’s trumps fault. surprised... wary new vaccine concerns rushed research, unknown side effects etc one thing. Literally believing governments nations worldwide faking pandemic nebulous New World Order headed bunch billionaire supervillians want inject mind control microchips general population steal elections overthrow US government whole train thought. know people know know believe problem whatsoever telling anyone listen. Anyone embraces beliefs willfully ignorant. Unfortunately know related quite people believe horseshit. Viral vector vaccines relatively new too!

DNA RNA vaccines used many years clinical trials. HIV particular. Efficacy great track record HIV, superb safety profile. also 237 deaths yesterday per worldometers. 
 
8 states 100 deaths, 2 170 higher. 
 
This beginning going record high deaths out. 
 
Stay safe can, vaccine almost here! Forced extinction sounds like humane plausible idea.

Stupid humans spreading virus. suggest humans? Same, forgot manners respond people. Bought coffee yesterday every question took moment register. Really well control it. yes need let run poorly controlled least couple years typically see really bad complications. So...don’t that. hard understand mean. use one country example, say Norway, help understand handling shit? far 15000 ppl took it, I'll wait till million taken vaccine. major health effects issue taking it. There's thing permanent primate immunity coronavirus. best vaccine grant us 3-4 years need entirely reformulated. experimental SARS-Covid vaccines prior outbreaks granted 6 months 2 years. still never tested even partially successful vaccine ""common cold"".

Sometimes wish like bats, immune whole host similar viruses instead apes. I’m glad you’re able least elaborate stance this/show basic understanding covid spreads. person I’ve asked they’re anti lockdown spewed typical “covid flu!! .01 death rate!!! Muh constitution!!” Uhhh perpetually underpaid broke evicted soon wtf anyone else even read article? says nothing giving vaccines countries. UK bought multiple vaccines make sure they're covered least one working option. best, ""spare"" vaccines could given countries that's suggested anywhere article. Yes, yessss keep talking like narrator conspiracy theory YouTube channel. 

The bullshit referring claim masks work cases rising everyone wearing mask. fundamentally untrue. many freaking studies show efficacies mask usage help quell this. Also, even close everyone wearing mask. literal anti-mask protests. Im glad people Kansas town cooperating, that's case rest US. Cases continue rise people wearing masks, social distancing, continue gather holidays, weddings, sporting events, etc. 

I'm shut down, too. sit pretend wearing mask work help slow spread. People actually follow rules happen. Because, I'm speaking hear family rattle about, CDC keeps changing recommendations restrictions one knows really virus, wore mask still got Covid (even though explained that's mask initially for), (no lie) ""we tired hearing people rattling safe.

Now CDC making changes causing non-believers continue. example, 6 months this, told CDC 14 days unnecessary need 10 test quarantine. Otherwise 7 days needed testing negative.

Testing throughout country keeps finicky. quick result testing shown flawed incorrect, giving false positives false negatives.

There much propaganda conspiracy hospitals get paid extra Covid patients quick tell positive mark down. Considering part operation warpspeed received $1.2 billion US government mass manufactured US least four different CMOs well AZ extremely unlikely receive approval. may distributed much mRNA vaccines approving safe working vaccine US government invested heavily unlikely. thinks gonna president one day. haunt hopefully people remember.

It’ll months everyone’s covered, even w quickest responses even first recipients going waiting while. problem think find many progressive folks would willing sit rationally talk designate land borders, whereas talk people right refuse want want crush side idealogy refuse let split country.  enough people general it. get coming I'm like side lol exceedingly clear detectable spread, 🤷‍♀️  Fauci: Americans, could DONE would get vaccinated.

Half Americans: I'm sure muh freedums infringed upon working Bill Gates inject us microchips NO!

\*More people die need to. mean, every time try comprehend 250,000 individual lives lost chest gets tight feel like I’m dying.

There mercy abstract nature math. It’s understanding that’s correct. 20 million vaccines stock 10 million people get two doses. worth, much support Tuesday-Friday threads sub. really hope mods change mind. Interesting close number Trump's approval rating last 4 years. pub lads

We're dumb enough population unfortunately.

Wahaay, got vaccine, back normality!

No no. need stay WFH treat like lockdown least Q1 Q2 next year I'd say, otherwise unnecessary pressure NHS potential deaths. Scammers gonna scam Honestly people need start packing mace, tasers, guns protect business shit. Yeah, believe that. said mostly jest.  vaccines available go places used. sit warehouses waiting dear EU bureaucrats job. massive civil unrest option would bloody brutal. I'm that. Wailua couple arrested reckless endangerment boarding flight traveling San Francisco Lihue. Police say 46-year-old man 46-year-old woman knew tested positive virus placed passengers flight “danger death.”



Good! Start taking vitamin C, D, Zinc supplements. wife recovering it, think vitamins helped.   insinuates people country would take optional vaccine people even wear mask?

This sub right along. negativity, reality Georgia good? still counting tests too? So.. ""aiming"" 92-96% acceptable Oxygen levels could increasing patients' mortality risks 2-6x higher oxygen levels. Doctors around world considered ""acceptable range"" - many people died due under-dosing oxygen hospitals? Lol, way people talk think Nazis rounding taking gas chambers. problem buying them

It bit. We're going economical shock Xmas next year bills arrive borrowing spending we've done year gone. group. people dismissed ideas still wary this. Nope. got emotional. finish line sight. miles go. guess fair enough, I'm surprised given unhealthy population US would take long. comorbidities associated obesity alone, etc. can't people third world countries trial? also see strain, ethnicity local climate affect vaccine. Love hop top comment became cluster fuck politics. competition good country live, U.S. would rank low.

We yet know vaccine later line, know actually happens. Also, know things happen COVID around last year so? Go appointment. Take reasonable precautions:

* Wear mask - one fits properly. wire across bridge nose hold top edge skin. least two layers relatively dense cloth, dense forces air sides mask. wear glasses getting fogging lenses, feel air escaping sides mask, fit properly. Try again. 
* Wash hands. would expect doctor hand sanitizer scattered around. Use it. 
* Stay two three arm-lengths others.
* linger inside longer to.
* touch face.
* still concerned, talk doctor. Find there's anything particular want do. want healthy. Ask healthy. good news personal circumstances life situation family stay home time. never close anyone outside nuclear family.

The bad news us lack central federal leadership, stay home time. worse news everyone afford stay home time, screwed. Ya say..... nice analogy, material back that's actually works? much worry besides horses here. World Health Organization Wednesday tightened guidelines wearing face masks, recommending that, COVID-19 spreading, worn everyone health care facilities interactions poorly-ventilated indoor spaces.

In June, urged governments ask everyone wear fabric masks indoor outdoor public areas risk transmission virus.

Since then, second global wave epidemic gathered pace. all, 63 million people globally caught COVID-19 1.475 million died it, according Reuters tally.

In detailed advice published Wednesday, said that, epidemic spreading, people - including children students aged 12 - always wear masks shops, workplaces schools lack adequate ventilation, receiving visitors home poorly ventilated rooms.

Masks also worn outdoors well ventilated indoor spaces physical distancing least one meter (3 ft) could maintained.

In scenarios, masks - protect transmission virus rather infection - needed accompanied precautions hand-washing, said.

In areas COVID-19 spread, also advised “universal” wearing medical masks health care facilities, including caring patients.

The advice applied visitors, outpatients common areas cafeterias staff rooms.

Health care workers could wear N95 respirator masks available caring COVID-19 patients, proven protection aerosol-generating procedures carry higher risks, said.

It recommended people vigorous physical activity wear masks, citing associated risks, particularly people asthma.

Adequate ventilation, physical distancing disinfection “high-touch surfaces” gym must maintained, temporarily closure considered, added. hope local news asks Tracy every day guess would lazy reuse 'dumpster fire' Kinda like ton conservatives randomly decided hate Bill Gates summer, even though none could articulate exactly why.

""Shady business practices"" best excuse could muster. Trump voters btw Though centered article thing stood decision doctor featured--despite doctor rural community--he chose travel across country New York City seemingly vacation late October.

He defends saying, ""[I] meticulous plane, sitting front, last on, first off"" blames ten minutes spent shuttle bus DIA. ""[O]n landing Denver International Airport, Papenfus boarded crowded train terminal, soon alarm bells went head.

""There people literally like inches me, we're crammed like sardines train,"" Papenfus said. ""And I'm going, 'Oh God, superspreader event right now.' ""

The reality could caught COVID anywhere trip, ten minute packed shuttle bus.

Personally, id rather pay like social security now. maybe medical divison social security additional tax assessed. Regardless, id rather pay expense, rather liability/pay penalties it... slightly paraphrase ABC News:

Vietnam gone nearly three months without local transmission English teacher confirmed infected Monday. teacher spread virus nephew student his.

Vietnam recorded 1,351 cases far, including 35 deaths."" Funerals happen outside, wouldn’t one?  Everyone know symptoms last December thought may covid ended testing negative antibody tests. respiratory conditions likely, even covid widespread yet. like plague inc tested vaccine almost 1 million people many different According article, 73% least likely take it. Feels disingenuous say 30% willing mean 30% said they’d ‘definitely’ take August, anything even approved.

FWIW, wouldn’t 30% back - I’d want see scrutinized first. Yet I’d first line could. “Immune” tested vaccine almost 1 million people many different  that? dont really like one, Id rather get pfizer Hell yeah raves aren’t gonna happen  Better safe sorry God fuck...! Small brained people often do. perceived initial decision start testing 2 dose method. decision come Pfizer announced initial results, view lens scientist, makes sense conduct separate trial two doses goal optimal outcome necessarily tied next 6 months. single dose likelihood sufficient get EUA trial concludes, would matter updating protocol offering vaccination options countries purchasing solution. us won’t get months, early part phase, order groups given vaccine announced Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI):
1. residents care home older adults carers
2. everyone aged 80 over, frontline health social care workers
3. everyone aged 75 over
4. everyone aged 70 over, clinically extremely vulnerable
5. everyone aged 65 over
6. people aged 16 64 underlying health conditions put higher risk serious disease death Covid-19
7. everyone aged 60 over
8. everyone aged 55 over
9. everyone aged 50 over
These groups cover 90-99% risk dying Covid-19, according JCVI.

10. Everyone else!

Source: vaccines may end approved, though it’s looking good far! smelly butt? Sound right  here’s thinking gonna get Christmas work... Yeah, official recommendation JCVI. However, widely reported NHS staff actually receive 1st, due logistical difficulties Incoming multiple super spreader events Georgia! start vaccination count Masks guarantee might *help*. everything I've read, household transmission 50%, meaning guarantee reduced preventative measures. Masks also reduce viral dose potentially reduce severity disease well. worth doing, think. Actually no. Rather “This new virus getting know. Including role immunity spread.” uhhh, Australia looking hire American lawyers? US exactly involved developing vaccine UK was. Germany actually find extent though committee voted 13-1. sincerely hope concerns prove wrong. vaccine tested old, unhealthy people may work intended.

You realize purpose. case anyone dies liable, reduces gov's financial burden taking care senior citizens may die due unstudied age group, basically free study old people vaccine company paid US gov aka taxpayers.

FACT 1 person intelligent enough realize actually going rest care... probably paid off. Didn’t. Nope. Let’s go Grandma’s sign wrote her. /s Wait till armies across countries hear this. [Get 'em 

I hope. fuck strong response? China dragging infected people away quarantine posting people front door ensure it. “strong response” now? Nice ;) fair vaccines huge scientific leap...ever. work same. variations proteins use antigen priming. also people scared new vaccines idiots. vaccine last thousand vaccines, proteins changed suit needs, reality testing looking several things,

 effectiveness, proteins viruses makeup may lend immune response. 

Lasting effect, proteins create long lasting response, multiple doses may necessary new antigen utilized. 

Negative immune responses - anaphylaxis, allergic reactions, inflammatory cytokine responses, etc. thing test though new situations could arise. 

Immune response reaction amplificafion -. antigen used cause body create response come contact virus later date harmful immune responses due presence immunity specific antigen? 

Harmful Immune responses prior exposures - people exposed virus past lower titers immunity conveyance immune responses vaccine could harmful?

Not really much else exists. 

With actual pharma chemicals like antidepressants, steroids, anything matter, chemicals either completely novel novel analogues known chemicals, whatever case lot vaccines erybwode ranging effects chemical responses body depending huge number elements, kinematics stream metabolites also effects may reactions need studied avoided. drugs never rushed, vaccines see real problem long basics examined. Referencing fair it’s UK Time TPC lunch (Ten Pints Curry). many people Australia most, far! 7:30. lot us yet. Give couple hours lol. Didn’t get memo? sub hates positive news. Correlation mean causation correct answer rage Wow expecting available soon. Great news finally 2020. got 100k dead though. can't believe it, started great =/ Sure bro That’s really, really poor take. isn’t single mental health professional tell restrictions aren’t affecting mental health. single one.

From personal standpoint I’ve affected following ways:

* Loss routine: days I’m essential go in, days work home, never know it’s going be. 3 “offices” (work, home, bedroom video conferences), never really chance set one going back other. can’t even meal plan grocery pickup basically random, never know you’ll get won’t

* Lack access person therapy. phone call isn’t same

* Lack diversity: people need stimulation stimulation comes diversity, ive got dozen hobbies take place spot there’s much help

* Exercise: working livingroom isn’t enough, choices running sidewalk alongside major road (think strip mall row), crossing dangerous 45-55mph intersections getting occasional bottle thrown me. I’ve gone working 15hrs week maybe 2, even struggle.

* social support network: haven’t seen friends since February, Skype calls died back June guess one cared. alone, like island, occasional text doom scrolling box 

#That said, restrictions fucking important people dying. need more, less Well plants climates could start indoors long you’ve got utilities. Seem remember poppy plants far pretty well leave cold. upstate? mother-in-law works hospital Carthage Chinese Russian vaccines.

errrrrr we're clinical rats Sweden gov admitted fucked big time herd immunity simply work virus looking lockdown measures SCIENCE BITCH! Sick tired vaccines people pumping make cash.

They dont even chance prevent getting corona virus.

All chance get severe covid-19 80% chance withoit vaccine anyway. 

Instead real drug prevents corona virus entering type 2 cell shutting ability replicate entirely getting ignored cash grab half assed vaccines. taking comment bit seriously. Anybody lives 100 built bit robustly long term survival average.

I asthma, definitely inferiority lungs built, although strong ways running gymnastics. Ya'll speak yourselves. I've throwing rage fit; like since 20; anyone pulse. 

Or maybe give citizenship somehow claim I'm American anymore. want lumped fools. 

I consider part collective ignorance remain snobby holier thou asshole. saw shit coming since Jan want star cookie, thank you. :p week two Sweden likely pass spring peak regarding hospitalisations. 

This despite fact patients average spend much shorter time hospital compared spring. Im kind uninformed this, seem know stuff. May ask, long would take reach 50 group everything goes right? time frame linked either sucess rate vaccine manufacturing time? idea fast manufacture vaccines reach asia? dont share formula countries? everything isnt back normal date, I’m done. I’ll speak Covid’s manager. Hahah first time? 


Jokes aside, son exposed twice, contracted once- somehow didn’t. 

Schools follow two week rule- exposed positive, it’s two weeks homeschool. It’s super stressful- cases keep comming school. garbage Hopefully light end tunnel coming train Probably essential workers already knew 75% 85% population. That's rough. Thanks clearing up. tried access link, unsuccessfully. worry detering someone getting required second dose. Praying feeling awful thing become reason avoid vaccine. Risky vaccine isn’t r/comedyheaven Fingers crossed Save click? They're gone Rhode Island. Field hospital started taking patients yesterday. us opposite nothing, fellow dipshits ANTI (anything safety) Nop, aren’t rare anymore, considered fact immunity covid lasts 3-8 months. It’s picture. Vampires cannot recorded. Friedman, 102-year-old nursing home resident Westchester County, recently survived second bout COVID-19 first hesitant say I’d get vaccinated year pushed close edge I’d get vaccinated bi weekly life back I’d carry card prove necessary It’s strange think mother 102 years old. actually old enough outlive child passes old age. deadly teenagers??? NBA players Tom Hanks survived without side-effects? rich famous dont side-effects poor unknown gonna die it? Interesting virus....I say. $300!?!? They’re like $20 normally. what? surprised? majority people US Lockdown skeptics realize problem lockdowns stop spread virus, expose decades deliberate austerity starving country's welfare healthcare systems sake transferring wealth upward make handling pandemic complete nightmare. USA virus First I'm atheist, second ""thanks ingenuity researching vaccines"" would right coice still nowhere ""god"" included, religios nutjob need majority old vulnerable take vaccine. Lols fucksticks fine lockdowns long preferred authoritarian leader tells to.

It's hilarious stupid half electorate is. bet Trump still seen map. It’s even crazier perspective - rockwall I’d classify DFW suburb. It’s maybe 10 miles Dallas county border, 30 minutes downtown dallas. used drive regularly gigs.

So poor person kidney stones call around 5 different ERs metroplex 7 million people find one room them.

And tiny rural county hospitals like near parents (Llano) may 10 20 beds, probably ventilator respiratory specialist normal circumstances really bad case would stabilized transport austin, temple, waco... big cities I35 corridor... near capacity. That’s happened dad heart attacks years ago - two helicopter trips 2 weeks, he’s part 50% plavix doesn’t work for.

Man, next 3 weeks going hell. people won’t isolate within households maintain basically stay home orders (even it’s ordered) january war zone akin italy back march. covid messes (who knows nasty surprises cooking up, still almost 50 days go), feel sorry Biden folks. going hands full months (maybe years?) cleaning up. sure take article seriously half countries listed even Eastern Europe. something like pandemic prove god doesn’t care us. Literally thing get life back track science made man sky sounds like kind flimsy rationalization people use defend Trump’s crazy behavior. Newsom’s hypocrisy shameful, I’ve lost lot respect both. defending good conscience, including “she’s human.” Yeah man wondering same. Would think 1b? We're small group ever listed anywhere really Title pretty confusing. contract Covid-19 twice? imply contracted Spanish flu Covid-19 (once)?

If contracted Covid-19 twice, bigger story itself? though cases still pretty rare. really messed up. jobs care anymore. what's even worse new covid relief bill gives businesses liability make work unfair covid conditions, cannot get sued. best bet getting doctors note.. fire doctors note maybe take kind action.. still ridiculous. fed govt. needs pay us stay home. economy working class keeps dying. No, it’s herd immunity approach embraced just-resigned “Dr” Scott Atlas, person administration listening recent months. 

But 73 million people loved approach are. Fortunately covid-19 long term effects, eh? FYI actually don’t know vaccine limits transmission, prevents COVID symptoms. look asymptomatic patients Pfizer Moderna believe. Thank America never sleeps!

But pretty tired. May need quick nap. live Florida, vaccine become completely politicized. like masks. truly unbelievable. go work healthcare? know anecdote, seems matter careful are, requires whole community stop this. Hiding inside definitely help you, still need supplies point, know bunker 1 year supplies. did, we're already coming year quickly. merely beginning end middle? absolutely right, also solution *right now*. need things workable within next six months, overhaul society's entire attitude towards work life balance cards timeframe. excuse health authorities using avoid admitting wrong along. Time war saying. Like, ""they built different back then"". officially end game pandemic thinn right yet get downvoted. Stan you. I’m super happy news, already saying keep wearing masks keeping social distancing everyone (and sort everywhere) ensured immunity. talking year two. don’t think (Or, hope) won’t end long. definitely summer sounds early music festivals real normal. expecting like: Able Internationally travel summer vaccinated gathering family friends safely. big events yet. Ngl, saw first word ""avast"" read comment pirate.  I'm curious everyone's thoughts vaccine. plan get one, available so? trust it, worry it? get vaccines too? live America half friends self lockdowns half think awful virus hoax. Half people know go near vaccine ready. I'm curious people thoughts. garden growing Winter? Yeah, lives Florida Shit, really? that’s 400k people minimum vaccinated end year? That’s awesome! americas hat We’re east coast! That’s inferior socialized medicine 

/s  really heard morons say know unfortunately. I've trying get details without prying. ""Parents Cousins Long Term Boyfriend"". connection bit loose. possible, given location age apartment/condo. intubated died within week other. cousin boyfriend absolutely devistated imagine. I’m teacher I’ve seen impacts students, it’s bad doom gloom everyone thought (I work high school, can’t speak younger grades). I’ve actually seen MUCH depression anxiety coworkers. getting stat from? Feels way off.  I’m philanthropist, handle already taken Great see fast approval, sure give FDA additional pressure (as needed pressure is).

Remarkable too, story last Friday [United flew first shipment Brussels along repositioning aircraft readiness distribution US.  science works. anomalies detected investigation conducted validate it. declare study result noise/false/fraud follow prediction. bother even read studies first place, decide everything based imagination. China avoided lock-downs much possible Wuhan. Beijing June targeted lockdowns, recent Xinjiang Tianjin lockdowns all. China also moved away cellphone based contact tracing used personal call contact tracing since Beijing outbreak, despite cellphone based methods much effective ability enforce it. even China aware welding much power make look bad, feel like might apply nations. american exceptionalism  It’s needed. know it’s said combining winter apathy virus leading something don’t want see graph. know virus still way worse now. Thats Biden, 
Dumbass Mmmm watership Yeah, ... ***free*** fucking idiots!!! I’m you! healthcare still going work everyday trying safe. It’s exhausting Normal outlet. I’m tired. Thanks republicans. You’re scum sucking crud earth. wish nothing misery. Get fucked. 45 percent cases asymptomatic throughout entire infections. 

Of symptoms, nothing wouldn’t brushed away allergies. 

It isn’t admitting lying it. It’s vast majority, symptoms nonexistent mild never even know they’re infected. Perhaps admitted immunity brand new disease understood insisted country go full steam ahead herd immunity policy... upside-down best thing relieve pain kidney stones (aside drugs). takes pressure stone.

I swear works. I’ve screaming pain, trying invert using couch... moments relief. Quite scene! becoming South Africa - third world country first world infrastructure. I’ll she’s having. author read Ernest Becker - Denial Death, first. whoulda thunk hear you, sound like stretching finances way possible then. Also sounds like post extremely careful need though fact living area separated rest house huge.

I would interpret people telling move worried health. breaks heart anyone else would personally careful yet still get taken damn virus others take seriously. Cool! Let English try first... Darwin work without test Poland obviously families infected people roaming free, infecting others 10 days. sure long lasted changed rules weekly panic. Wasn’t million? Stalin good killing.

Apparently, dudes 18th century thought good idea. wow... teenager died. accurate? original, man career comedy ahead! sub definitely US-centric (more I'd like), mods put great deal effort preventing becoming extension r/politics. would absolutely become way without diligent intervention mods daily basis.

Anyways fully expect post explode traffic North/South America wakes soon. 

Aside that, truly amazing news UK humanity! kind shit adds fire people taking virus seriously blame them. Spoiler alert: there's going states vaccinate wealthy first. That's happens mandate. true. wish HIPAA suspended could hold tours ER ICU non-believers. Maybe even help room patient look eyes someone struggling breath see true fear. 

Thought would likely leave feeling even hopeless since doubt seeing someone struggling breath would pierce cold heart. Yup. I'll take vitriol downvotes. is. antivaxxers refuse take it. Production going fast people think is. two shot series. I'm expecting late Fall, early Winter 2022. really freaking soon and, IMO, really optimistic. Jesus tapdancing Christ. idiots. Sorry people actually take seriously. They're literally anyway. seem get posted whole FAQ, lol. long term effects:

1. Long term effects modern vaccination much thing, ones I'm aware couple issues may may linked H1N1 vaccines, namely type nerve problem called GBS type sleep disorder called narcolepsy, extremely rare, vaccine trigger them, manifest within 2-3 months, max. ""effects years road"" never observed, despite lot monitoring. 

2. mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines believed safer traditional vaccines, deliver Covid signature spike whole dead virus like H1N1 flu vaccines (The flu vaccine might possibly trigger GBS/narcolepsy flu able trigger GBS/narcolepsy, vaccine supposed mimic infection, times immune system over-reacts). spike vaccines lot targeted, much less likely over-stimulate immune system cause neurological issues.

3. fair skeptics, mRNA vaccine vector spike vaccines relatively new, know way cause problems mean risk free. However, general public expected get vaccinated next spring, nearly year data first batch volunteers. people understand morality others need themselves. alternative people die, kids go hungry, vulnerable people society suffer lose homes. Sure top 30% income brackets, worried inflation hurting investments, honestly evil fuck, yeah widespread suffering small price pay money devalued fractions percent. bot “friend” ? love this.  Australia need show proof flu vaccination visit nursing home. guarantee hospitals nursing homes limits people vaccinated COVID vaccine widely available. 

We also nifty set tax childcare benefits linked kids’ vaccinations date. 95% kids fully vaccinated per free government schedule. It’s amazing effective cold hard cash modifying behaviour fringe anti-vax. Québec different rest Canada. Well known fact, acknowledged English-speaking Canadian whenever actually start meaning something. yep. 10 days still low imho. damn virus gonna tell *her* go. She’ll go she’s damn good ready! think “emergency” part medicine needed urgently, would used emergency setting. Note: dined restaurant hung friends girlfriend indoors since *March* I'm used things multiple times week.

But anecdotally, know several nurses doctors anything hunkered down. parents sent wishes months ago. Neither wants vent, one wants hospital admission, want cremated ashes spread mountain Colorado travel okay. Meanwhile none things mentioned 'stereotypical Americans'

And also included note left bottom?

""(Note: obviously apply every American generialized viewpoint Canadian)"" “with negative test” important part article title. comment get 50 upvotes? think test vaccines 😟 Trumpets mad take church's turn medical facilities let assholes went Suckpreme courts run around masks tend fellow church goers covid leave real medicines people fighting live. phuck dumb ass people. Tied Germany. hell happened? Best news yet  incredible! Pfizer apply emergency use authorization UK within last couple days? apply longer ago? 

Either way, hope US follows suit. Whatsapp messages played huge part bolsonaros win brasil 9 months since wife died. much significant abstract idea 'when started'. s'posta Sick Burn, orrrrr? last exams coming haven’t done shit past months. It’s gonna disaster  skip part said wasn’t psychic? one knows, like don’t know there’s 100% chance 70% population WONT take summer. whole point linking articles show various public health experts saying it’s possible could return normal summer. replied giving two cents based think, concrete evidence proof. feelings anti-vax movement possible distribution problems. You’re choosing consider Fauci thinks situation doesn’t fit think situation. Sounds hypocritical :)

Anyways, I’ve wasted enough time conversation. Happy holidays happy new year. good analogy saw usually vaccine development like trying drive across city rush hour traffic. Lots delays waiting stuff happen. Covid vaccines it’s like driving across city empty roads, traffic lights green police escort. usual delays holdups removed everything possible done speed up. anyone think before? Genius plan! personally ""wait see"" camp, entirely hypothetical knew mind going made results huge n = 30,000 clinical trials. 

Now risks virus exposure vaccine quantified, risks vaccine pale comparison risk getting covid. focused wrong part. news cross blood-brain barrier infect central nervous system. body robust system protect brain isolating rest system. viruses circumnavigate barrier, bad news. know SARS COV2 this. Although loss smell/taste neurological symptoms gave us early hints, still needed tested experimentally that's science works. confirmation good. ""Leaked"" they’re “different”

You convinced reason border US closed tourism? rest world: DUHHH  gotta breaking records like person taste going Yoko Ono collection? middle ground this. Mayor Breed extremely lucky party French Laundry didn’t result super spreading event.

I’ve sub beginning read stories people taken pandemic extremely seriously seen loved ones person. I’ve read stories people restaurant industry lost entire livelihood, tried things right way keeping others safe, rug pulled Governor Newsom. people normalcy brought back lives. It’s fair Mayor Breed flaunt wealth status like it’s direct slap face tried right thing whole mess.

I used think President incompetent I’ve discovered incompetence run amok nearly levels leadership pandemic sides. Obviously you’re willing look way terms Mayor Breed’s actions refuse support type complicit behavior corrupt leaders.

America new president soon think things get better regard. think current leadership voted levels sides aisle. I’m tired dealing blatant corruption. Government change like seasons. funny y'all treat democracy like we're living North Korea still free say kind lies make protest Obelisco (even theoretically lockdown) cry ""dictatorship"". Trumpets mad. agree - Johnson losing ground rapidly facing tory revolt repeated lockdowns. needed approval hang power fact approved much faster countries makes worried approval process compromised. soooo convenient man charge. need US need us

The US exploits world, they're extremely far self-sufficiency. now? Dutch get free vaccine that's decided many months. like Floridians care Aus? lot sheep too, also illrelevant. Biden January 20th, Tfump still running country president idiot Thanks guys comparison contest. 1984  covfefe trial run /s 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😭😂  Bad Government gives millions media cover up. Also, 50% Argentina works government, pensioner relies welfare checks. go government get fired Reddit american social platform. Internet countries. accessible nationalities.

If think otherwise, go talk shareholders CEO reddit. cash. profit gets higher allow nationalities in.

They owe loyalty american. offered 10x salary, quit take short term role would think.

WHen things calmn still need nurses anyway Excuse ignorance leaked? standard show updates maps news? else would people know measures place area? amazed competence everyone working there. 10 months constant working even developed disribution plan keep vaccines cold. Amazing. woud fucking lost without them. 

On hand portrayed sheer incompetence politicains yet again. point here, saying point: ""yea sure, 70% taking vaccine"", saying case may go normality, prediction, well know fact.
What fact, neither prediction 70% take vaccine, even making statement, based ""hope""
On field, 70% taking vaccine, makes knowledgeable person here, proofs that? 
You taking argument making fit want yes 70% herd immunity, know since many decades ago..but know sure 70% fully take vaccine even Faucci knows sure... Scientists here.

It hard see sort hybrid third world nation populace really want admit it. bump 30% people willing take Actually, probably quickest way. People cry love complain, see one giving attention, they'll get it. got treat anti-vaxxers like kids, since that's act. mean lock gay orgy... conservative anti-gay hypocrite. want say OMG shocking information. yeah, we’re f’ed.

Too many people don’t care. current ""official"" numbers (which actually twice that) going double enough people vax next year

so another quarter million deaths another 10+ million infections official twice everything reality

since lot healthcare workers, going wasteland stupidity none happen, series bad, lazy, greedy impulsive choices said things could done persuading country avoid strict lockdown.

But literally misinformation? persuade country avoid strict lockdown, **possible** strict lockdown. Either way, neighbouring countries, least deaths Europe, even strict lockdowns. short/light lockdowns, things Sweden, second wave. see information quoted Oxford vaccine, huh?! Ohh well think everyone waits it? smart rich people get first access. Like anything American cost concern buy anything. understand flu doesn’t fill hospitals right? Fucking moron. 
How likely happen (those severe mental illness prioritized vaccine rollout)? Obviously everything state state basis I'm wondering possibility outside long-term psychiatric facilities probably included first tier i.e., people severe mental illness living long-term care. RuLEs tHEe, Me. walking around whitehouse maskless receive positive result infecting everyone site.

What's point? Narrator: ""Absolutely one shocked hear this"". Nah I'll repost someone makes one I'm sure many would upset someone store without mask hear hundreds attending church party, even they're good health access excellent healthcare.

The argument everyone take precautions keeps others safe. logic politicians they're reckless, they're still putting everyone else risk. fair, least surveys show least 1/3rd Republican voters taking COVID seriously. many Republican voters voted Trump thankfully lost (even though Republicans house senate races.) hope narcissistic Trump way, rest Republican politicians start taking COVID seriously, since toe line Trump anymore. No, I'm still going cautious. can't take chance get infected. Sputnik would disagree. technically second 😂 study done SIX MONTHS AGO! wasn’t even vaccine talked about. linking study alone really muddles argument. see if. ignored all.

He’s psychic. neither I. man field 54 years. He’s gone school study types things. He’s director NIAID reason. Therefore, trust says predictions way anyone site experience. knows public health I. 

You said he’s overly optimistic he’s making claims without proof. you’re making claims without proof well trying downplay predictions, you’re even knowledge subject.  exposure, maybe 5-10% chance getting infected (depending infection could less little more). there, age without comorbidities, chance serious problems maybe 1-2%. So, yes, maybe 1 500 1 1000 hospitalized.

It's impossible, low enough best thing try worry. scared good you, mentally physically. responsible, isolate, get tested appropriate time (about week post exposure immediately get symptoms), try relax. Try avoid reading horror stories media, there's benefit there. Nope seen results election moron. think Biden virus remember nurse saying they’d call doctor see dying Covid patient doctor would totally refuse bc they’re busy non-Covid patients can’t risk getting sick themselves. nurses left watch people die. They're next Thursday I've heard Fauchi constantly said need masks restrictions modt likely sept. One scientists operation warp speed claimed April herd immunity another saidl March whole country vaccinated. chance happens. people seem really enjoying quarantines, border restrictions economic depression want last long possible. Thank you. 🤣🤣🤣🤣  think so, no; meant thought we'd other, specific advanced skills get work visas, might need degree that. dont nuke us insane motherfuckers !! wiped backyard gardening last summer shook first one loose. already Oxford vaccine applied standards process days behind Pfizer, take months. live, beat properly early. 7 months back-to-normal life. particular vaccine expensive fussy. us (on planet) probably get one these. said, many developing nations actually handled pandemic well whereas US UK not. Fuck gov tater tot Same. Saw news first another app. Opened reddit see top post multiple awards yet are. get prescription vaccine already? Unfortunately easily get amount needed large minority people join help. Life back normal, EU best: lethargic, bureaucratic incompetent. Dunbass Trump still president  Seriously, kind news Americans watching? Every time see Americans talk Sweden regarding COVID-19, everything always exaggerated often straight misinformation. guess agreement country region includes schedule delivery vaccines. Probably Pfizer little lattitude choose. still catch it, still spread it. regardless, efficacy 100% still take current precautionary measures prevent catching know part 10-30% work all. I'm really sorry. Mine small usually hurt they're moving bladder. can't imagine one big. CNN fake news America: ""WE'RE NUMBER 1! WE'ER NUMBER 1!""

The Rest World watching horror: ""This kind contest people want win.""

America: ""SHUTUP! JEALOUS!"" guy admitted ""oopsie"", ok, forgive him. ^(/s) Biggest Lie Lies c-19 virus affect young people. Yikes vaccine, immunization general population getting everyone infected four successive waves killing dozens millions They'll likely speed bit. They're looking people help vaccinations mid December. Brexit start saving lives next week. oh god poor thing. I've always said I'd rather another baby pass another big stone. I'm dealing one want go ER turned away. primary care said long pee fever tough passes. Thank god medical mj. source that? Seems like pretty useless vaccination still get it, without symptoms. Source? People still lot social distancing Sweden, similar results European countries similar levels social distancing, although may done bit late. People follow recommendations. seems worked better regions Sweden, much badly hit. Stockholm *a lot* deaths big cities, example. annoying Americans keep talking Sweden though, one really knows what's going here. No, herd immunity strategy, actually things suppress virus (lockdowns legally possible though). No, republicans, ""success"". want Swedish strategy, also need universal healthcare, basically unlimited paid sick leave first day, importantly **follow damn recommendations**. would absolutely disastrous US. prayer /s

I stunned 2020 'day prayer' elected official's actual list possible responses unfolding crises.... ALSO selects it. herd doctors prefer. It’s ape juice one. People confusing giving 600 million physical needle injections(300mx2) time distancing required downloading app. source that? government charges vaccines monumentally stupid one. ND reportedly 100% hospital capacity, SD called covid capital states right now... supposedly recovering according map? patient spent second night ER Dallas. lucky though, found actual bed least. always happen. Imagine nothing value add conversation proven wrong every way possible attempt classic move sidetracking conversation hide embarrassment.

I refer Muricans use ""Sweden's tactics"" they've heard shitty news, defence retarded.

Thanks playing, weakest link. Goodbye. back December 19 people getting severe upper respiratory infection bad coughs low fevers, could it? know lot people got that. Weakest leak ever. Next leek reveals popularity cheeseburgers. Tegnell never said he's seeking ""herd immunity approach"", word ""admits"" never shows article despite misleading link.

Sweden always based strategy two ideas: 1) know long COVID going (and certainly back March) last approach sustainable lead pandemic fatigue 2) strict lockdowns unconstitutional Sweden. aim relatively light restrictions ""flatten curve"", [in original everywhere else.  absolutely lmao nonsense speak Fuck me, really?! Dude mRNA never used humans trials. please stop acting like something know about? ok admit risk ok pretend know safe truth don't. I'm first one call anti vaccine people idiots, also common sense simply studied enough. described going Brazil That’s exactly bothers me. There’s many people sub find way make every good news story negative. They’ve since start pandemic. approval doubt GREAT news. It’s amazing simple that. people still finding way make seem like there’s hope future made up, senile reasons aren’t even realistic. ironically, people preach “listen science health experts” it’s things getting worse don’t view things getting better. Weird. diabetic roommate \*has\* get house shop \*every\* fucking\* \*day\*. rides transit every fucking day. Yes, wears mask, often cheap ones gets flea market, good three layer masks make her. least she'll leave bus maskhole gets on, drives nuts. entire household 5 people risk, including her, go shop every damn day! several at-risk friends, she'll go visit, wearing mask, still. agreed get tested monthly. can't get pull head understand risk. sugar foot strong. mom vulnerable due pre-existing condition. What’s difficult going hospital. Rule Covid. nothing lose getting ass hospital people worried vaccine made ""too fast"":

1. used vaccine development taking decades that's saw lifetimes. early vaccines easy physicians 1800's really know viruses could develop rudimentary vaccine within months work. Vaccine research existing diseases slow easy problems got solved centuries ago, stuck hardest nuts crack. Covid brand-new virus, could easy rabies hard HIV, think got lucky. like SARS1, might still stuck animal research phase.

2. Historically, infectious disease vaccines reach Phase 3 trials 85% probability success. normally takes years pass volunteers generally get infected fixed rate. Covid spreading rapidly process greatly accelerated. trials rushed, evidence generated extremely rapid pace. also benefit nasty atheists well. want something targets righteous. got medicine, use miracles? Easter 2021 we’re lucky haha Chances low. Anxiety make things worse. South Dakotan, surprising. mind boggling bit life carries almost normal. Buffets open, many people stores roam maskless, schools enforce mask regulations... get bad people. new cases 500-600 past several days (we getting 1200-1500 new per day). I'm sure hiding positives giving false sense security leading holiday season. fear slow motion train wreck end. Everyone given prevention vaccine coming (in 4-6 months). Ermmm...it really needs scientific question. idea evaluating data could considered formality mind boggling terrifying. 14th November (the latest date available) 19394 long term care facility residents UK died COVID-19, 40% total UK deaths.

Seeing 300000 LTCF residents start year would easy target cut thousands extra deaths short time.

Many front line NHS LTCF staff also vaccinated starting next week high risk 18-65 age bracket. sure much expect vaccine approved today. Yeah either way wonderful thing UK :) Sometimes better sleep alone. Pretty sure last week. real symptom headache 4 days body aches seven ish.. Thanksgiving would worst day.


But idk not. fever. go work that's it. GF works home goes kroger. That's madness, hope gets sorted soon. Thank you. know appearently latest date would meet, Sure thing. get mad left society allowed shops/bars/restaurants/planes etc. reddit, aren’t supposed read article, comment news, water, wet. Seriously, always ""Dakota this"" , ""Minnesota that"" , ""Tucker Carlson said this"" , ""some NBA team that""

I unsubscribed soon sub became full American news Politics. pop big news. Mom Grandma died year well. Mom April Grandma June think same. listen Inside Science (bbc radio 4 podcast). whole piece accord richer countries distribute vaccine countries would trouble affording it. makes sense need get virus die globally. another Redditor pointed out, logistics tough, unless Oxford vaccine works, needs fridge. think gates foundation involved fair it’s probably nice weather saving Florida right idea distribution process? shows catastrophic looking graph basically meaningless. FDA historically rolling reviews, means get data one big dump, unlike UK nations, get data pieces review come in. FDA take longer review data nations. Given Covid's urgency, thought FDA might switch rolling reviews speed things up. However, September/October, Trump saying vaccine could election, caused lot alarm suspicion. Shortly after, FDA actually *tightened* review requirements, telling companies submit data least 2 months observation volunteers. want get political, think FDA got scared vaccine got early, one would trust Trump. are. covid last week, trust want it. Congratulations! Surely someone suggested Gov. Noem-pathy now. _[USA left chat]_ Never seen gross disregard human life... Anyone know they've managed approve fast compared EU? 

Presumably regulatory standards procedures closely aligned strange EU said likely approved weeks Depends mean back normal, it? Fuck that. doctor give prescription mine. would anyone wait back line? great answer! get now. understand big numbers understand big numbers! Popcorn's ready sure? Yup. J&amp;J + Novavax. FDA approve AZD, they'll reallocate doses EU emerging Asia etc. Availability going problem Chinese Russian vaccines. article 2017 called ""Herd Immunity: Keeping Zika Bay, Now"", describing study found Zika naturally spread widely enough enough people developed immunity cause spread slow trickle. may know Zika vaccine. calls phenomenon ""herd immunity"", totally naturally without saying anything like, ""gee, scientists never seen anything like without vaccine normally use term stuff we've eradicated widespread vaccination"". astonishing UK really medical approvals Brexit... American's legit stupid af comes pandemics apparently fucking morons thinking hoax president tried downplay ffs. Holy shit. that's US. Tegnell notorious including people countries excusing failures. getting ridiculous. Like press conference yesterday drag Austria, always compares worst hit countries. data submitted robust enough conclude quality, safety effectiveness vaccine, EMA’s scientific committee human medicines (CHMP) conclude assessment extraordinary meeting scheduled 29 December mean meet date. this.... surprising one? already know America joke world. wettest blankets contradiction public health experts everywhere saying (normalcy April I'm west). concert industry absolutely back summer. vaccine (apparently) covers 20 million people trouble since could take months get another one approved. 
  
You know 20M start right? mean they're gonna keep buying supplying more. Also, going take months get another approved UK. Moderna Oxford going right behind this. really surprised see confirmed year over
 get people waiting INSANTLY go back normal thats realistic whatsoever. 
  
I see anyone saying ""instantly"" go back normal, Fall 2020 high conservative timeline guess normalcy come back possible sense normalcy could return. dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

See self isolate seek medical attention. Take care! pushed through, scrutiny still high, pass usual hurdles. thought youd finally gone home cause blown That’s I’m expecting honestly. *sigh* Wait, surely Americans pay vaccine would they? would work barriers like affordability preventing people accessing it? mind. happened March government took strict measures virus little chance spread. lot people think overblown unneeded virus flu/only affecting elderly.

 Couple bunch scandals involving prime minister (unrelated Corona) daily protests months summer/fall trust government pretty much gone. 

 Schools started September, weather got worse government hesitated take stricter measures late would unpopular. also elections coming next spring.

 last issue, high procent elderly population. healthcare system barely functioning lacking staff even pandemic. lot current staff also consists said elderly population. are. Welcome reddit, place get downvoted making realistic prediction people want hear. vaccine (apparently) covers 20 million people trouble since could take months get another one approved. vaccines distributed, lot young people (who spread virus most) gonna give masks distancing since think ""ahh, got covered."" gonna cause problems, especially around Christmas time. see making prediction late next year things back normal terrible thing. get people waiting INSANTLY go back normal thats realistic whatsoever. things take time. touch something (say fork) sister uses fork, given virus?

There's (low) chance since need inhale virus infect you, eating result stomach acid killing it, Fork cleaned (especially Dishwasher) chance basically zero, much important share air (at least much possible..). suspect could end hospital COVID.

As soon start feeling bad (worse would feel flu) go ER/Hospital least call, sooner intervene better. 

If get someone go pharmacy get Vitamin (2-4000 IUs per day), Vitamin C (500mg twice), Zinc (75-100g spread throughout day) coupled Quercetin (250-500mg/day).  

Pretty sure counter US well assuming average person probably supplement anyway. Fuck that. doctor give prescription mine. would anyone wait back line? People Reddit sad can't really negative time now. great news, let's positive! country stupid enough order 50 million doses who-know-what country, Turkeyland. I'm really scared unreliable vaccine cause harm good. 

p.s. i'm anti vaccination, trust china. come? shame questions efficacy.. good sign accidentally used wrong dosage one point.

Looks EU pre-ordered 400m dosages J&amp;J vaccine. I'm sure we'll dozen available within 6 months. Already using platform that's approved smart. Summer 2021 somewhat normal. restrictions lifted April, even countries started vaccination process early.

Do really think need 100% population vaccinated see effect cases? 10 20% would already impact. Getting fact. thing seems many cases. We're going fuck somehow. It'll turn vaccine makes sterile, something. fully on-brand Covid response. That’s right. grandma died embarrass Trump. Neither I. Really 2020 limit. years. last hour, 19 posts message emergency approval Pfizer vaccine UK. 18 latest removed, since they, contrary Swedish daily updates, effectively reposts first one?

Please confirm help reporting them. get benefit treatment complications get virus refuse take provided, presumably free, precautions stop getting first place? curious living situation turned out. Sorry loss. Lock Downs extremely effective emergency measure, think able pull us trumpland, awarding [ending also evolved 7-11 type store. differentiated saw couldn’t compete smaller chain without gasoline sales (like gas-station convenience stores.)

That said, like others said, frozen items large part offering drive lot sales—and lot people delivery safety know frozen items go pretty quick unless immediately get home, can’t decontaminated alcohol UV-C quarantined like dry items. additional sad factor healthcare workers rural areas might possibly know patient, know them, mutual friends / acquaintances etc. I'm sorry happening country :( must tough. words, tough cannot describe it. herd immunity another 6 months, vaccine vaccine. China keep shite arse! come sudden 3-4 Medical companies started announcing found vaccine China also claiming found one. 
It’s like waiting world suffer wants piece market share sell vaccine. Honestly, sounds like obvious movie plot... 
NO, THANK CHINA! Yes. 

You create new thing, totally new technology, push 7 billion people once.

Even software development work way. Facebook rewrite whole mobile app backend change everything, even push 1 billion people once.

And that's software. ""leaked""...like obvious Muh, know ""safety high standarts first"". Lives wait. literally laughed loud listening BS German Health Minister yesterday find theory Yup bloody ridiculous. I'm Nigel farage stretch imagination, things like show benefits Brexit imo. Probabilistically, directly counter government laws.  I'm Boston free test sites, many require symptoms. Hell employer offers free onsite testing employees get one every week. Different believed eh? don’t say?? good. sooner vaccine works, better hope normalcy return year 2. saw Hungary expressed interest using Russian vaccine. Whether believe safe another matter, surely Hungary able use whatever vaccine wants, Brussels tells use? Sweden would better guy didn’t say anything begin with. worry rest civil service joke. neither. never going back actions COVID. I’ll without.  get side effects flu vaccine regularly?

In Europe (particularly: Hungary) uncommon flu vaccine.

Every year huge campaigns urging elderly take flu shot, massive commercial push, widespread among elderly either. 

People think ridicoulous take vaccine something common. why?  B+  YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS stupid retarded bureaucracy causing hate it. slows everything. decision made quick EU. could easily talk like right moment lazy. 

UK proofs legit reason wait longer. funniest shit BioNtech german company lol. drives fucking crazy. 
I'm office administration clerk. know big even understand bureaucracy slows everything things need triple confirmed sometimes. 

This cost lives put health care people danger longer amount time. Can't even imagine feel, Also, could please provide definition new submission rule? remember report posts break it. 

Is posts case death numbers them? reposts message, albeit different sources, meaning posts come first one removed? posts don’t give us truly new insights? posts small countries far north people US don’t care about. 

I honestly interested definition rule. get it’sjust frustrating. Also though currently cases outcome survival rate 97%Then also take account individuals long term problems many still experiencing even though survived. stay 3%level that’s 9 million deaths country 330 million.

lots link... think that's great news. staff split, easy observe following results. 

It's still RCT, older nurses opt get it, younger ones, skew statistics 

I wonder studies already planned follow vaccination happens there? U.S. lava. anyone surprised? right, Tegnell know shit anything. mean, know this, go profile see several transcriptions made myself, one image reason E# AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine big covid killer. transported regular refrigeration costs $3-$4 per dose. also able produce lot doses lot faster. households able safely gather? haven’t seen anyone talking timeline that. I’d like see parents again. vaccinated, ideally don’t worry taking bringing home partner. Great news. anyone know where/how see data (or redacted version data)? phd biochemistry bio-statistics, fascinated this. I'm sure that's long term aim right they're planning far. 50 priority groups might different - vaccinating uni students seems good way drive infections instance. need see leaked map understand Old people biggest burden doctors healthcare due severe symptoms higher death rate COVID age group. Removing burden would quickly free healthcare resources others.

People want go doctors people dying covid, people stop dying covid dramatically less scared regards COVID. People less worried parents/grand parents dying, spreading vastly reduced consequences, procedures non COVID related illness become priority NHS again. 

INcreased death people want go doctor going hit older age group much group due afraid getting it. increased suicides, increased suicides dramatically dramatically lower increased deaths COVID itself. healthcare worker horrible, I'm even hospital that's hit hard. Work stressful. I'm mandatory overtime every week. constantly trying keep policy changes. pool toxic mentalities shared amongst staff. always worried getting sick. feel sick, get tested lucky, truth tried. 

Then, every thing used de-stress gone. usually plan trip December horrible SAD trip look forward tremondously helpful. realize priveledged. That's gone. gym gone. Going dinner, massages, game nights friends, visiting grandma? gone. 

It's literally work play makes Reddit user one burnt person. Leave asap.  obvious slow transmission, it’s difficult understand large effect weighed factors speed transmission,” Tegnell said. “balance may different many others believed.”

I'm personally going wait Moderna get one... insane time alive pick vaccine. 100% sideegevta vs 50% chance.... 90% vs 97% effectiveness blowing mind. bad Johnson &amp; Johnson taking long 😔 I've found taking enough painkillers kill bull moose also works pretty effectively. It’s shame people dull around think you’re idiot Dying issue younger people. Getting lung scar tissue cytokine storm damage cells, long term interfere producing energy oxygen, quite possible long term issue young people want luck of. No, us expect/hope normal life span 78-80years. UK population 68 million. That's helluva excess. want virus get out. Wait, covid hotspot? really naive delusional think Americans even afford things listed. greatly respect [Serum Institute 

They world's largest vaccine manufacturer (even COVID) produce *billions* highly affordable vaccine doses many different pathogens. supply countries world, poor wealthy alike.

They good, incredibly important work. seems extremely LIKELY started China hit worst earliest

or simply detected far better earlier rest world. ""warp speed"" lol. Guy joke. everyone declining dumb. us disease don’t want use precious resource immunity likely good better vaccine would offer. states circled sharpie labeled various obscenities  You’d surprised much low Vit mess brain body up, it’s necessary precursor hormones important things. Get top strong Vit D3 supplement direct sunlight skin every day. Don’t 50,000 IU Vit D3, that’s toxic. 20,000 IU day several months could catch need be.  magnesium citrate help absorb Vit D.

Eat lots fruit Veges, drink lots water several home prepped dishes meat fish week.  Use virgin olive oil butter supplement omega-3 oils you’re eating lots fish. 

Ideally you’d get doctor measure bloodwork every 2 months track well you’re getting vitamin back normal range, sitting nearer higher range protect covid. That's worries me, guidelines, states whatever want. Cross reactivity hcovs? Mr. WarpSpeed going happy. drawn provisional priority list, targeting people highest risk. Top care home residents staff, followed people 80 health social care receive first stocks vaccine - soon next week. Mass immunisation everyone 50, well younger people pre-existing health conditions, happen stocks become available 2021. given two injections, 21 days apart, second dose booster.

So, unless health-worker 80, going see side 2021.

Also, vaccine two shots within 21 days. betting getting one likely Summer 2021 long effectiveness vaccine last? get two shots, good 6 months? 1year? Yea fact custodian, taking virus seriously people clean for, coworkers, company, disheartening say least. actually map legal votes makes really happy UK extremely pisses EU. BioNtech german company. 1 hour drive away me. probably even US want talk earlier 27th December. Fuck real. “Like miracle.” can't use russian one, approved I've looking something like area. Thanks! Nice!

NOICE! I'd see sources well. safe vaccine? know approved person never vaccinated anything worry about? Thanks UK

We need nightmare end soon possible. Sick uncertainty pandemic I’ve telling people get oxygen meter family months. busier hospitals get people pressured treat home may hypoxic. meter give real metric observe real information call see drop instead “I feel crummy” know getting information nothing said here.

//A Swede. can't wait pass see needle they've testing home Brazil months now, dumb find out, lol That’s big if. read today: Everyone US wants one one June. first batches going month. meeting right decide 10-20 million get emergency authorization goes through. common order seems first healthcare workers support staff like nutrition janitorial. Second, elderly care facilities. Third, elderly high risk individuals. Fourth, essential workers/general public. We've got enough one 20 million, need approve vaccines first.  Yes, yesss. Exist perpetual fear unknown. Ignore evidence favor government media tells you. Yesssss.

To clear, stating support full shutdown instead ridiculous half measures clearly working. guest, blame other, fight amongst one another, let elites continue profit willful ignorance. 120%-Doctors call capacity. Administratiors call maximizing profits. Sa fait du mal à écouter... :( really sad young family stage. Courage la famille et surtout les enfants. 
Hope 3 recover shit Covid! Sadly so, yes. EU envy British regard except Maine apparently inject veins asked disappear Biden takes office? wanna bet 50 bucks it? shit. nowy tends* mean, show evidence contrary Thought sort formal testing, they've skipped steps ensure safe started loading citizens 

People fearful western vaccines least followed standard procedure YES!!!!! grandmother died (random sudden death), we're going funeral all.

It's 4 months today. strange. feels though disappeared one day. I'm wondering I'm strange disconnected feeling never funeral. never got see body. 100% get mass vaccinated say “see! nothing worry man!” - taking account thousands people needlessly died along way because, freedoms. Great news wake to. :) data still produced employees services place pandemic. 

Lmao, 6 months ago shitshow. Hundreds government organizations fucking clue do. average person takes accept change.  child. Grow up. Chime conservative argument anything 'socialist' Europe ""but like 16 people living Sweden"", course works them. got nerve commented another post saying won’t back normal “early 2022”. That’s unrealistic expectation itself.

I’m gonna stick listening experts instead Reddit scientists like think know professionals. Normalcy lot countries return far far earlier HELL YEAH!!! Anyone link study itself? I'm paramedic would like info. Keywords: works God hope keep border closed. wanted america first? get america alone. one out. Georgia Maine something right. story month old (Oct 27th).

Alternate agree Good old times US behind Sweden covid deaths per capita. Now, let's see going, twice? It’s amazing since last March. never would thought would position. hopeful there’s end sight. totally agree.

I know current evidence shows 'it looks okay'. wide deployment could, repeat, could come unexpected results people.

We see soon. Sweden currently. BS. medspa article pn Pfizer said prevent symptoms contagion Worth mentioning, actually quite similar spring numbers comes hospitalizations departments. are, however, far less ICU doctors know better treatment methods put everyone respirator directly. aint best idea. Believe me, know russia inside - dont want vaccine  Median age hospital mean much. ward 50 people staffed people, ICU staff per patient drastically higher. staff ICU also seeing pretty much constant deaths can't anything about. Relieving paramount, protect health services protect people working it. We're going thousands staff PTSD, working literally death many many cases. 

As soon massively overfilled ICU wards start empty staff go back wards, get break, try sleep shit people like, maybe start recover little increase amount people hospital see normal medical issues. Wow that's kind sad protecting us, bring freedom oil fruits? Also, really, many Americans healthy? Come on. one unhealthiest nations world. nation playing Russian Roulette Covid-19, USA corpulent masses cannot even run quarter mile without dying lift 50 lbs. Late Feb New Orleans early hot spot. picked covid work people travelled around time mardi gras. be. legit go around people except grocery pick up. wanted give day care try preparation school opening.

This day care also official before/after/summer care school. ended opting virtual learning rest year. hard, don’t want get sick again. Thing - it’s equitable. Wealthier children likely parent able quit job stay home help remote school (they able alone). Wealthier children also likely private schools staying open. Weird, cases hospitalizations last week yet spiking california new york. happen? Governor Noem accidentally switch bodies them? Trust me, Fauci, I'm getting COVID shots soon can!

Unfortunately I'm also less physically healthy 23-year-old unemployed autistic person who's living parents (one Special Ed elementary teacher, she'll probably start getting shots end March warms them) getting SSI I'm likely able hold full-time job either way, I'm also continuing hole like July/August whenever's like two weeks last shot. :P December 30 2019 one earliest find  Yeah, ""what's safe"" ""you're getting support so....here"" talk every state stupid California everything, gotten tested county facilities 5 times zero expense since pandemic started relatively zero wait times. Guess something right. difference children deciding get vaccinated. stupid parents. Sometimes children gotta protected dangerous adults.

Extending putting things body *your own* consent dangerous step. 6 year old severe viral induced asthma vaccinated? support Cuomo going jail? One person know says serious claimed ""hospitals trained prepared work full capacity, fine"" hospitals first reaching 100% capacity. person also thinks (in U.S.) use Sweden model do, also disagreeing universal healthcare implemented. Genuinely curious can't get tested. seen several free drive testing sites valley. What's going coast that's different wonder. vast generalisation?

[36,560 died car accidents US 2018. mortality rate 0.01% orders magnitude Covid.

And even looking additional 4.4 MILLION US citizens injured 2018 seriously enough require medical attention.

I think need get bit perspective here. leaders setting example glad hear Newsom apologize admit mistake. Faucc, responded taken mask drink water, hardly gotcha moment. said fever paying attention, said body ached woah. come right away healthcare worker gave rapid results test.

Heard back even sooner expected. Negative. still wanted know horrible fever feel better, negative test feel special anymore. Never got answers, got better. could (since cycle thresholds given) actually virus all, small number nonviable COVID RNA they'd inhaled someone else.

This possible. PCR-positive, either infected point false positive result. longer contagious time testing, possible determine time period contagious. interesting thing close contacts negative.

Several possible interpretations:

1) True asymptomatic cases ever contagious. need worry unduly. wear masks protect pre-symptomatic cases infectious.

2) True asymptomatic cases may slightly contagious period, strict lockdown masking rules Wuhan, essentially transmission them. I'm sure even China, think people wore masks homes.

3) asymptomatic cases asymptomatic others wore masks, received low virus inoculum easily controlled. actual paper: ""When susceptible residents exposed low dose virus, may tend asymptomatic result immunity.""

So u/MoistCakee's comment ""this wear masks"" mark referring point 1, on-target referring point 3. landlord job. maintained home stable renters got work like, entire half hour per month average, depositing check paying bills.

When interview new renters background checks, like entire extra 8 hours work month. every appliance breaks arrange repair person go out! Lol

I landlord got divorced rearranged life. job, small job. tenant drama occasionally, found nice little family charged slightly market rent, became damn easy. bet Cuomo wishes had. bet jerk constantly even though he's king covid deaths top school children missing school small businesses he's destroyed. fucking idiots think pray covid away.

Religion pandemic. Usually leaks provide us information don’t already know think politicians question feel responsibility all. imagine sleep well believing they've finally got upper hand liberal 5g terrorists trying get people wear masks nefarious reason absolutely could explained pandemic going on. Idk man went Walgreen’s Drive Thru people refuse distance wear masks blood hands. one ever forgive forget done. monsters. also showing 2,600 deaths today US... thanksgiving surge hasn’t even begun manifest yet Ya mom lives southern Oregon, covid like symptoms, pneumonia, even test her. like July. gets flu July? Pfizer BioNtech one, understanding say, do. deaths today since pandemic started. enough winning?  Yep, record number deaths 24 hours, bad news--but 13 European countries even higher daily death totals today per capita basis, death totals rose also unfortunately expecting sharpie... keep wondering happens pandemic rest world Biden takes over? magic cure affect too? [See slide Bussinesses one motivation: profit.

Breaking safety rules good profit. Mandating vaccination good profit too. assume prisons military would get first.  populations limited rights wards employees state. would Bill gates involved? Geez spoiler alert? I’m made face Trump read article. worked hospital flu shot optional didn’t get weren’t going scheduled work. wouldn’t terminated could come back winter months passed.

Is like every hospital? seriously can't believe everybody getting serious since vaccine close.

Makes sense. screwed You’re getting downvoted hell paying military much protecting citizenry like this? like blames victims, many support stringent rules control state local policy. elderly, young, poor mercy state local governments employers protect give resources protect themselves.  Hospital systems usually organized specifically. There's often ""Staff show hospital ever"" ""Staff never step foot hospital,"" organized department. workers system-wide required get flu shots couple workers system on-campus offices, even though they're ones.

I think vaccine tighter rules, imagine people get vaccine organizational simplicity rather people deliberately cutting line. I’m south Cannon Beach, love Astoria gotta go near grocery shopping :) Thoughts prayers. 
/s That's fucking dumb! Super counterproductive. **Absolutely**. US, got ""paycheck protection program."" loan small businesses supposed forgiven used money payroll expenses.

Bureaucracy sucked life it. Big restaurant chains barely met criteria got huge loans return money got shamed it. small businesses simply fold quickly ran out. Many others left limbo, knowing money going forgiven not. So... 00.01%? SUPER ELITE. 

Make sure straw drinking paper...
WE want kill turtles! 

YOLO Literally everyone stupid except people listen social media ... *no comment*

\*shakes head violently\*

Sorry supposed surprised? don’t think I’m allowed donate blood. grandmother probably going die next days Covid-19. ailing dementia beforehand, maybe would vaccinated spared death Covid-19. fools malicious malicious fools utterly wrecked response pandemic USA. people blood hands blood spilled turn. I'll never forgive forget people flagrantly disregarded masks social distancing. mention would verify essential worker not? wife teacher, like would need bring teaching license? would state distribute list people eligible based employment? also makes uncomfortable, maybe point two choices: either nobody can't free.

I really hope enough people act rationally get vaccinated end like that. Oh, know, first dose give immunity. Oklahoma doctors nurses walk out.

It’s way get anyone pay attention. wonder percent people would actually like though. subreddit may need change description.

Current description below:

""In December 2019, novel coronavirus strain (SARS-CoV-2) emerged city Wuhan, China. subreddit seeks monitor spread disease COVID-19, declared pandemic WHO. Please civil empathetic. subreddit high-quality posts discussion."" Maybe. would good case stopped government officials stunts like one. government needs pay everybody $1,000 take it. make everybody take it. much earlier could vaccine people's hands used Human Challenge trials? many deaths would saved?  said joke 3000 series GPUS still stock since launch Trump didn’t lose lack vaccine. lost personality pisses people off. unanimous? Kidney stones fucking joke. must torturous Oh yeah I’m sure religion would made everything better. It’s bang job already. think messaging calm. don’t want panic, people little panicked. I'm nobody, making wild-ass guess. Good thing new york governor listens science. That's child school months, grandparents dead nursing homes, friends lost businesses. Brilliant clarify mean good way. like getting tiny part virus, seem nearly scary. retrospect realize saying vaccine works like covid sound reassuring current administration breaks law everyday lol Guess virus big deal all

Well Gavin Newsom, Chris Cuomo, London Breed, etc., healthy people 40s 50s, isn't. That's true even Joe Blow Kentucky.

It still admission leaders, actions, think virus big deal. people pulling much ass tinder. Baffles me. Damn.

I know doctors still go eat, handful who’s kids still sports, bunch still send kids school, sticking take stuff outside home away people.

Even guys know already caught donating plasma know antibodies still masking up, taking many precautions longer chains transmission.  ICU bed availability 6%, means 51 beds.

And hit Thanksgiving hospitalizations yet. found well fitted kn95 works much better glasses either cloth mask surgical mask. think it’s 100% fit issue. Sorry situation. helps, intra-household infection rate quite bit lower people imagine, studies report 10%-20% non-spouse, 30% spouses. Room-mates fraction that. See Table 3 (Although couple studies reported 50% ish). 

According studies, like important things avoid prolonged indoor conversations. name Dr. Mike. He's well known youtuber. posted apology 2nd channel avoid backlash main channel. tried brush ""well friends surprised boat hookers checked CDC website said it'd okay"" thing. record 96,000 people hospital virus U.S. Monday. U.S. seeing average 160,000 new cases per day almost 1,470 deaths — equal country witnessing mid-May Interesting theory, know anything kind stuff guy internet (like me) (no offence) exactly 28 days later? Bigger issue lot people going back second dose. adult, vaccines need multiple timed shots. one think rabies. Part Hippocratic Oath states "" prevent disease whenever can, prevention preferable cure."" Someone file complaint licensing body get license suspended least revoked. wish virus make spike protein lol Travel isn’t dangerous don’t contact people. wasnt lockdown party. staunchly anti-gay warrior 25 man orgy Brussels. idiots got busted 10 people. And/or they're Human fallible making dumb choices. really surprising. 

(Myself:.. 46yr old Male 0 medical history)... caught Corona back March-April ended spending 38 days Hospital (16 days ICU Ventilator fighting stay alive). took 12 days learn walk again. high heart rate problems 6mg shot Adenosine stop restart Heart (all wide awake, fun times). . at-home oxygen tank month 24-7. Heart-medication blood thinners 6 months. Rehab long arduous. Rebuilding endurance Heart Lungs mostly done. Every breath take, get reminded lucky alive. 

And yet that,. telling re-telling re-re-telling story past 6 8 months.. still (nearly every single week) get people saying things like ""OMG, 1st person I've met who's it"" (or various variations ""you're lying"" ""you must edge case,. everyone knows fatality rate less 1%"")

There's shit ton people make sorts cognitive-bias mistakes daily. (and I'd guess large, unaware they're even it). Thanks! 10 days right phase 3 data? I'm pretty sure 50-75% people every country form pre-existing condition fair. rips damn heart out. guys remember story early like March, city bus driver said passenger kept coughing on/around like week later, driver dead? REPREHENSIBLE. People refuse wear masks jail time. I’m sick shit think that, unfortunately, many people normally quite skeptical became extremely ""masks nothing"" push government healthcare officials early (followed series drug suggestions seemed money-motivated). shows people willing push narrative without studies behind (for whatever reason), reason trust official sources insisting brand-new vaccine safe, lot people stand gain it.

I'll getting soon regardless, sympathize people required jobs, honestly know I'd choose optional me.  Even Canada appointment virtual consultation doctor prove *significant* severity amount symptoms. gAtTa kEeP eCoNoMy oPeN though needs proper healthcare funding? Fucking joke.

Yeah. went Eleven Madison Park (also 3 Michelin star restaurant) 30th birthday - wanted see fuss about.

The dinner rolls amazing - everything else meh. Ambiance also meh. guess ticked bucket list item- food definitely worth paid it. Who's panel? First I've heard it. map terrifying. kidney stones kill you? super painful There's problem, must've taken hippocritic oath. Yeah, shit. people ruthless Lol. made comment vaccine hijack comment ... saw [an old unfortunately named product. 1000 suspected reinfections like 400 million expected initial infections? crazy people want go back normal open everything also refusing take vaccine. I'm pretty sure indirectly required get vaccine lot things. indirectly, mean right forced, without need give lot ""right"" things. money come from? print it? economic implications printing dollars taking debt federal reserve? pied piper come calling? negatives printing money? pandemic: vegetate home watching Netflix playing video games. 

After pandemic: vegetate home watching Netflix playing video games.

It's normal us introverted geeks along. Since used sharpie map, can’t see it. doesn’t count. They'll lot overlap ***buuuuut*** people likely give fuck vaccinations likely go without masks big overlap too.

Either way, outbreaks weird news blurb hear opposed dominating news. fucked think we've able sort one $150 (what bargain!) make due January, thank much kindness. Sure equitable. government times like issue. needs done get goddamn virus control. Fund support schools families get set properly. 

I'm single parent staying home kids. prioritize belongings wealth wellbeing family others, it.

But nothing right done. stop whining opening schools. Stop whining equity equitable pre pandemic long shot. Collectively work reap proper rewards. Assholes went lives like virus whine complain can't get want. so? exposed alcoholics plain old party drinkers thus decided age 10 never drink/get drunk.

I guess people go way? would phase 1b. 1a risk read. ICU, ER, First responders. enough doses cover group two step vaccines might begin branch out. Here's live updated map, zoomable, color scheme remember NYE followed near-miss nuclear war, pope slapping someone, start pandemic.  freaking one would listen.  I’m dreading Facebook memories start pop weeks. Yeah, government turned doctor recommended herd immunity. Boris Johnson also regretted earlier decisions. speculated Steve Atlas resigned proponents herd immunity taken back imposing strict lockdowns. Dead people tell tails. I’m South Dakota, don’t get it? Always ends thud, sadly. count 50. add DC Puerto Rico 52. Plattsburgh  told 10k three weeks ago so. seems going quick pace. Granted hit 60k Jesus, throw money hire people. like need waiting time this. Biden's spooky laptop mysteriously disappeared assure you, US thing. Whatever happens happens, long stock market still going up! Ouch.. suggest latter manage now.. Kidney stones next sound fast horrific Yeah scientific community federal government never wrong anything, ever. first would want anyone be... sad. They're real happy though, let's let thing, okay? gonna get lot worse gets better. ~3 weeks long time exponential growth. sadly, many already gotten COVID. US allowed 270,00+ people die virus. care living. know person applied business never got money. good idea paper, poorly executed. 6.4 million subscribers main channel. However, top comments recent video, many videos, people calling out, I'm guessing it'll drop soon. Please try encourage good behavior. would amazed follow you. may awkward first, bare it. Make masks crew. Let's ENCOURAGE one another ultimately end. Big Friend. ;) many church leaders requiring masks whole time? bet hospital size probably like 70 beds. 120% capacity means like 14 people many. think people understand people takes overwhelm hospital. expect see people hanging window Ferry episode Grey's anatomy go hospital, reality probably couple people waiting room taking chances home. probably stole operating rooms push couple beds into, couple people need oxygen monitoring halls. 14 extra patients ICU would typically require 3-4 nurses staff. enough person medicine notice, definitely enough put tremendous strain staff.

I feel important think see things like ""Of wedding 250, 5 hospitalized"" think big deal due ""low"" numbers people hospitalized. takes wedding, another outbreak bar couple ""small parties close friends"" basically push hospital well past capacity. saying spread much dense population particular area dense population particular area. state prioritized say here. 1A front line (so ER/ICU staffing) first responders. 1b healthcare general, congregate settings, etc. Admins probably get like might hear celebrities NBA players getting sooner. think takes map reveal that..... I’m Monroe county. Can’t get rapid test anywhere here, ED. appointments tests available. miss week work testing availability. studies safety groups, now.  Actually, working together vaccines differ depending source. sharing information virus everyone approach.

The safest approach probably China's using tried tested method inactivating virus, practically current vaccines manufactured.

The others trying radical techniques, willing give try folks concerned perhaps opt China's vaccine least something familiar.

We experience long term effects inactivated virus. one really knows what's going happen 20 years injected mrna strand. Honestly, televise everyone getting vaccine beforehand public service announcement, think could forgive them. Like not, celebrities influence people. I'm sorry, that's really terrible. That's America works. Expensive programs help people possible.  “We must save every single person destroy everyone else’s normal lives economy so” think mean hindsight 2020 People keep saying 95 above. actually 94%(ACLS number) higher fine. 93% great, people like COPDer's night like 88 93% range normally, smoker years, even youngish. could float aroun 92 93%  nail polish also affect reading, cold hands. Gotta push reinfection narrative man *Cries American* Probably possible anymore, simply many people.

So misspoke said that. point lockdown people control businesses something massively disproportionately kills adults 55 older is, opinion, many steps far.

Those want get vaccinated, will. never vaccinate flu season, won't. LOT unvaccinated people every single flu season; probably including current flu season.

I also think encouraging see people correlate speed quickness developing vaccine efficacy; something democrats republicans done. boils people saying one two things:

""I want get vaccine. trust President Trump quickly produced.""

or

""I want get vaccinated cannot force get vaccinated vaccines cause X,Y,Z"" etc. I've kidney stones

I also gave birth drugs age 16 big headed baby tore upward

Guess experience I'd repeat forced company recently started testing employees dependants, 40% testing positive asymptomatic. again, may affect mean may kill someone family. remember something year ago.  incredibly false intentionally misleading. worry reinfections guys. research look stuff up. Almost everyone treatment group suffered bad outcomes. compared hangover. extent problems would say fair trade: suffer hangover get covid-19. However, mean suffer worse outcomes future. course can.

Yeah, see that, also see mask pulled away face would expect drinking. also withnoting companions wearing masks making unlikely wearing mask well, except fact he'd drinking. far three examples leaders leading example, opinion, that's three many, certainly conclude 3 examples taking virus seriously.  Tbh, still think mostly people-who-are-really-nearly-dying-anyway getting batched accelerated death.

The tracker updated consistently.

I would post original tweet BNO mods changed rules  live Lubbock, aka Covid Tech.

And nobody wearing jack shit faces stare like I'm crazy mid june next year anyone wants vaccine people wanma come unvaccinated they're welcome anyone cares immune. know would hugely helpful too? Somehow convincing Trump get vaccine start promoting it.

YES nah im sure name me. thx bunch studies pause investigations think safe assumption something bad happened study participants. healthy die.

Hopefully everyone stays safe, research see map followed link. badly Republicans Donald Trump fucked up.* Ftfy video Chen Qiushi, went ""missing"" February ""found"" September. Apparently he's living parents government's surveillance. Glad see he's alive probably get videos him. people pray together large groups asked exempt lockdowns. probably think pandemic brings people closer god, matter others near die. think atheists likely aware science, pandemics, carbon pollution global warming. optional part everyone wanting it, kind annoying.  know new all, people would first line right could get healthcare. Healthcare workers take it, need most. people wish could get too.. laboratories? Fauci? China US? citizens world destitute currently. Fuck political finger pointing, parties people taking everything including freedoms. Well, 9% SD's population COVID, state floating around 40% positivity rate awhile now... um, yeah. definitely need mask mandate Oh definitely think antivaxxer! think people wanting see safety studies great absolutely correct. somewhere along lines ""long term side effects"" became huge concern. never major vaccine problem reason believe suddenly be, I'm constantly confused people wanting wait. Like long? months since people gotten it. 6 months long term? 5 years? 20 years? mean always longer wait. always strikes people really understand this, subtly manipulated antivaxxer talk (without realizing it) even antivaxxers. United Church Christ liberal denomination. joke UCC stands dor Unitarians Considering Christ. 10-15% report symptoms, I've read. us nothing temporarily aching arm. Duhhh  ineligible treatment coverage don’t

Denying basic medical human rights dab anti-vaxxers  would also severe young people, know, already ample time reproduce believe 1:1 trial, 15k got vaccine, 15k got placebo. 

All least two months EUA application, it'll close 3 months first jabs go world. trials started July August, people 4-5 months. Additionally, there's small cohort phase 1 2 trials (in hundreds, think, maybe low thousands) even longer, late spring. 

If even *one* people serious adverse effect regulators believed caused vaccine, today. fact, right now, regulators looking medical records. less, somebody vaccine arm fell ladder broke leg, regulators looking make sure caused vaccine weakened bones. Natural selection always wins end  sucks, said starting another trial 2 doses, whole big appeal J&amp;J vaccine would useful third world countries tracking get another vaccine hard do. guys, large r/HolUp . . . infections chance, reinfection numbers must still tiny now, even everyone susceptible again,
#tested positive first wave / population * #tested positive second wave * susceptibility ratio.
They totally chance, change much.

Also, many countries track reinfections. Germany doesn't, example. 
By equation, they'd 400 cases 20% susceptibility reinfection months. 

And know shape susceptibility time.

The thing helps tracking cases thoroughly neutralization blood tests. looks quite good, fortunately.

But low numbers mean much situation. print it, rest holds less value. Quit trying prove I'm wrong trying pointing non topics. Good, fuck em point.

This dumbest saying ever lost meaning.

Herd immunity code nothing. opposite strategy: literally worst case scenario we're supposed preventing Wait...Yahoo still journalists news staff? Can't hotspot whole country hotspot. **Taps head* Wait wait wait - prayers thoughts? That’s works. Gotta send thoughts prayers, prayers.

Alternatively, could fund testing, PPE, suspend rents mortgages, support people stay home vaccine comes out, whatever. tested positive yesterday. everything right, still work. near impossible getting line phone schedule 220$ test. Pittsburgh PA.

We're overloaded. Fuck administration, we're deep shit. hope symptoms stay mild :( Ha created title! context, ""within"" implies current date. accurate title would ""...within 3 weeks date receiving vaccine"". like fooling anyone: back normal trends next week, probably late next week. Appreciate it! Im pretty sure entire WORLD agrees sooo Maybe wasn’t contagious yet. Maybe hadn’t contracted yet. Find extremely hard believe would happen indeed contagious stage ill ness Thank you. I'll look ask doctor. Poor wear fucking mask go shopping protect elderly people immune compromised people. forgot much wussy people could be. He's moron, look post history. good news deformed brain one hypocrite somehow vindicates mask skepticism see happening depending vaccine rollouts go Fair.
Not sure asked judge me... I'll take it. 
I'm weak.

But, asked vision weak is. know me. weak? Bc got covid? die... many propaganda sources catering anyone conservative bent. 

What's crazy average consumer seem able understand they're lied to, even lies apparent. saying one day pandemic next hospitals overwhelmed. Yet like can't remember things said months ago.

Even disaster personally touches killing loved one, assume something else. many people there, marching around semi-hypnotic state, unable comprehend world around them. Deaths I'd cautious thanksgiving super low today would backlog thanksgiving. yh gonna get ugly definitely. two weeks clear much damage thanksgiving did. christmas new years. Testing likely reach 200k providing Testing reach capacity Ignorance privilege. Assumes everyone extra $$$ spend delivery. deadly* even Sweden admitted terrible idea corrected back norm Covid exposure. there's chance value changed 22% one week.

That's pure Data displayed page **was submitted directly HHS TeleTracking HHS Protect**, includes historical data National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) system data reported states. come thin air

I mean literally fucking does. That's QE is. 

You showing real ignorant.

Hope lose anyone care covid!  Rapid tests high percentage false negatives... PCR swab test far accurate. Boats hoes Covid?? Notice word ""Protect"" there? protect them, discriminate them. Ignoring demographic treating accordingly discrimination. Rounding corner. Lol vaccine close.

Don't oversell it. vaccine everyone close. 

At end December, we'll trickle vaccine. Enough vaccinate *some* front line health care workers trying keep everyone else alive. 

We've got least six months general population starts getting vaccinated large numbers. 

We need people focus following public health rules staying fuck home. next six weeks terrible time.  Interesting. diagnosed diabetic month viral pnumonia covid-19. Yes I'm 300lbs can't leave house! I'd say example weak. mean, happens, great.

But going happen... CDC audacity put countries tier 3 lists. 2,600 deaths today aren’t top mountain yet. It’s hysteria, it’s reality. day 15 antibody counts recipients Moderna vaccine approached people covid. day 36, 2nd shot 28 days, exceeded antibody counts multiple times.

So somewhere window probably good.

Table We're going double 3 weeks... absolutely Trump's fault. WHY? freaking idiot example website cited that. sound like cousin DUI. 2 dental fillings patient covid didn’t catch it. Shhh! upset Trump Cult. believe wearing masks. Saw article npr finding antibodys blood tests far back early December 2019. wife got pretty sick flight around time. lost sence taste smell Christmas terrible cough lasted while. 

So question. get blood drawn every week blood thinner. quest anyone hold onto samples long? Could checked antibodies? 

I’m thinking might get checked antibodies ask quest next week blood draw. Well I'm shocked. Flabbergasted even. would thought today would entire backlog shit. reckon we'll able get idea daily deaths backlog Purposefully, unpuprposefully, Americans collectively lost ability think critically reason. 

I, myself, American science nut, simply resorted out-and-out paranoia instead critical thinking. pretend kind microscopic hidden Thing emotions simply wants eat me, much scarf stack cookies. Unlike cookies, however, Thing anywhere humans are. What's terrifying pretend Thing latch onto without knowledge become danger others, way danger me. Since paranoia reached critical levels allowed one house since March. given rational thought, donned tinfoil hat, follow directives come air waves called ""Fauci."" ""Fauci"" says stay home, stay home. ""Fauci"" says wear mask face, wear mask face. 

Do us critical thinking anymore? Even us started event well-armed resolve courage spirit protecting others well ourselves? die-hard introvert love alone freaking paranoia that's in. fighting survive government well Thing. would done much better rational caring President gave us pep talks FACTS worked help us. haha ^ This

This huge problem country.

Ignorance going kill us rate... week, Sweden’s Health Social Care Inspectorate (IVO) found “serious shortcomings” elderly care, saying 6% cases reviewed COVID-19 patients given physical examination fifth received individual assessment doctor all, report found. acknowledged difficulties providing healthcare pandemic, said standards low home residents account nearly half huge scandal highly unethical,” said Yngve Gustafson, professor geriatrics Umea University, long-time critic Sweden treated elderly people pandemic. comment specifically Gluckman’s spent months investigating care nursing homes flood complaints relatives staff, stated one regions taken sufficient responsibility treatment pandemic.

To me, failure elder care Sweden one shocking sad things that's happened COVID pandemic far. Natural herd immunity impossible diseases. one name top head Plague Justinian. 

CoVs similar RNA viruses never natural herd immunity occur even 100 years circulation. 

Smallpox Measles around centuries without humans developing illusive herd immunity, far higher R0 novel coronavirus. 

Herd immunity without vaccination realistic diseases give permanent sterilizing immunity, thus disease continues circulate. Fucking morons I'm idiots Yep, could approaching timeframe, people losing theirs. friend try take grandmother due heart attack. Dispatch ambulance head next county. :(  Well, thank....science! logistics broken... no? Never mind don’t care know Apparently bad enough guess. hospitals beyond capacity Missouri. may space her. Maybe day prayer followed another 13 days prayer everyone praying home might benefit. meme SM. Eat shit, useless bot Exactly, ridiculous people keep saying ""oh died preexisting condition"". ever happened eye transmission say someone Walmart similar interior place hour. eye entry also subject 20 minutes close up? I'm speaking someone mask answers great, ethically, working save lives, deserve risk losing lessened. It'll excellent frontline workers' mental health know end hospital themselves, expect would positive effect quality care. don’t get is:
- Florida sudden drop deaths day Thanksgiving still persisting. 
- cases still rising relative drop trends would indicate.
- reporting hospitals capacity would indicate deaths likely follow.

No one going mention staggeringly odd numbers are? FL covering deaths? really need leaked government maps know this? Wishing full recovery you, stranger. Stay safe there! 

Unfortunately since I’m US, hospitals avoided COVID. decent-ish health insurance. ""Dipshit Times"". Apparently ~40% America subscribes it. feel superior though? useful though? keep touch people many ways try mind control you.

It seem worth cost humanity keep FB anymore. Pfft, outdoors overrated anyway. Full annoying people germs. third, dense Governor is!!! live small rural county PA. 300 confirmed cases. 14,500 residents. Spread slow. marked sustained Hotspot map. hell defining sustained hotspot?  Yes kind resale value trucks goes away? sale: slightly used refrigerator morgue trucks.  Recently cleaned. offers entertained!  Idiocracy meant documentary. Bring it. dad something similar WhatsApp forwarded messages. asked sent this, response friend forwarded message him. So, asked means friend wrote it, dad replied ""no, friend forwarded me"". 

It drives nuts. WhatsApp messages big Middle East. like private Facebook page. great hear! don’t know vaccine provides immunity drastically reduced severity. Without full immunity, still infect others, people need keep total number ICU beds USA has? 

Not sure even count man I'm worried non covid people getting care.  Meanwhile, virus: ""stop trying make unemployed!""  governor takes responsibility. worried free state. Used lot COVID state emergency money try get tourist businesses move state. nothing less horrible. protect hospital staffing levels. two urgent goals pandemic, keep deaths keep healthcare systems operational. Vaccinating nursing home residents first achieve former, vaccinating healthcare workers achieve latter. 

Contrary popular belief, healthcare workers much higher risk rest population comes infection deaths. get exposure, also better PPE regulations, access testing, better ventilated work environments. Antibodies studies suggest healthcare workers infected rate comparable rest population.

But suffering staffing perspective. work Canadian hospital moderate Covid caseloads, today found half physicians worked clinic can't see patients today. One home isolating outbreak kid's school symptomatic. Two exposed patients tested positive. exposed different doctor later tested positive, briefly require testing isolation. Hospitals cannot function half staff testing/isolating/symptomatic. work patients die, Covid otherwise. much part-time staff fill gaps, already stretched paper thin, can't imagine staff US coping. immunity facts reason become cytokine storm stupid. stop others dead. told entire family late February bad prepare isolate, etc. two less family members still, still downplay Trump's stupid ass. That's herd immunity works. Unless propose putting giant bubble, they'll interacting non-immune people, herd immunity makes hoaxers sound dumb. lmao dude thank educating fucking economics works. Middle school shit trying prove I'm wrong trying pointing non topics

Would rather prove wrong refuting open up. 

Lmao USA even fucking lockdown sense word, nut patriotic duty safeguard fellow come thin air.

Already proved wrong going shitter 

How so? Give many moved us tax reasons. 

It looks like net migration united states 2019 low compared prior years. previous decade 2010-2019, primary bilateral immigration corridor turkey followed lebanon. According [the UN report global migration. know, source social animals, stop interfering lives. 

Not argument buddy. Funny people think they're strongest turn whiny babies second cooperate one simple hazmat suit, health responsibility?

Because participate society unless kinda NEET. Learn social contract. feel bud, I'm prioritizing respiratory health right now.

I Mighty easy enough heat quick hits, Arizer work way? flu nearly contagious deadly. rocket science. saw people Facebook saying they’ve nurses tell hospitals capacity media lying everyone. post vaccine dangerous one get it. Oh defunding healthcare conservatives love do. Ontario conservatives also removed minimum number paid sick days unpaid sick days. Bullshit. lucky pangolin's name? using different definition ""effectiveness"" health experts operate with. express effectiveness statistical terms R factor. think get see reports like think democratic strongholds places impacted. shit. Everyone get already it. Nature overwhelmingly powerful.  pancreatitis flare point sit still stop burping throwing bile, took 7 hours get room hospital. either. Apparently correct response USA bad, Canada good. think CDC said nursing home residents also prioritized first round vaccinations. politicians care fellow Americans. sleeping really well night thinking much money made little work do.

Oh right another vacation un 2 weeks. happened time. time swipe card accept it. clue doing. get register 8 gallons milk can't figure pay. Probably rejected bank suspicious activity notify leaving country.  learned traveling construction workers lived hotels: get gas campfire stove use parking lot hotel make meals nightly. groups could save money makes lot sense you’re situation you’re get news?

Fun fact surgery recently put under, o2 %could low 88% usually returns normal week.

I 90% recent surgery. going take many years get entirety Africa India vaccinated... still hurt. years ago. dang ankle. 

Both times walking. don’t even good story! understand thing happens flu thousands people year well right?  Maybe they’re like one friends think aren’t actually many people hospitals hospitals actually laying people off. 

It’s infuriating. I’m constantly astounded stupidity people country. first months program, banks would laugh phone small business, since got commission proportional PPP loan. Waste time application 20 person company? fucking way (they said). bank incentives definitely structured wrong. I’m sending thoughts prayers, works well conservatives school shootings. real doctor would probably say difference diet would make negligible. need concerned transmission virus, prevent wearing mask, avoiding close contact many people, avoiding large crowds, etc. Whats prediction cases USA christmas? think going double, really wish i'm wrong Agreed. understand lot people elderly. Others Trump pulpits. “Just let everyone get sick! Problem solved!” It’ll interesting see people refuse mask social distance “won’t live fear” fear getting vaccine it’s definitely available. I’m afraid getting vaccinated, since vaccine candidates properly vetted. apparently I’m coward public health advisors asked sacrifice greater good. vaccine effective. imagine people got vaccinated became infected 3 weeks later? magically go away? taught think critically. Oh FML ever bad news. It’s even time Thanksgiving wave yet. Pretty soon they’ll hand body bag tell go get shipping container back everyone else. Living central florida tell every week go store see less less people wearing masks, retirement area.  USA: know doing, enemy certainly can't anticipate future actions. 

Covid-19: cough...cough... one (Arizer Air II), high different adjusting sessions really hard. smoke joint put go out, vapo ticks time shuts off. especially annoying online gaming.

And replied another redditor, building joint ritual quite like... agree really dislike liquor stores open alcoholics die comparison that’s remain open. open drink occasionally get sloshed. know one church area added third service, made people make reservations, distanced people family group, enforced masks, everything. pastor conservative side, encouraging see him. cant hotspots whole country hotspot 😎  Tell check Sweden now... people dumb. Save protect drunks, kill kids. never make sense me. burden healthcare system would eliminated soon old people vaccinated hysteria. 

Why? Atlanta checking in. get test covered insurance doctor orders diagnose symptoms (so pay doctors visit) maybe luck free test DPH symptomatic. asymptotic manange find place test gonna pay it. ordered performed solely purposes pandemic control re-opening economy, based determination attending provider test medically appropriate diagnosis treatment individual member, covered.  This includes tests performed asymptomatic individual solely assess health status required parties employer, common carrier, school, camp, travel authority/advisory, nursing home (to visit resident), government/public health agency research/epidemiologic study, ordered upon request member solely facilitate member’s desire self-assess COVID-19 immune status.

But god love private insurance. glad I'll get keep plan. Probably regards confirmed versus suspected cases Without going long explanation. critical thinking comprehensiveness time low. Due many factors. 10000% Agent orange strikes constantly hold checkout lines credit cards work here.

TF talking about? Credit cards Canadian banks work USA. probably mean debit cards. So, then, NIH funding lead breakthrough permitted vaccine development. something BioNTech happened upon pandemic rather incremental progress since SARS1 MERS emerged.

Sometimes better less effective vaccine easy distribute effective one lot logistics problems. Oklahoma City ICU nurse Lizanne Jennings comforted husband, Dennis, moments succumbed Covid-19.


""Are ready peace?"" recalled asking November 23.
'He said, 'Uh-huh.' said, 'OK. Mom's fine. back house. going stay me.' knew would keep fighting told mom already died. started giving morphine Ativan. turned rubbed back. said, 'I love you.' said, 'I love you.' said, ""You're going go now, OK? finally peace.'""
Dennis took last breath 30 minutes later, Jennings told CNN's Kate Bolduan Tuesday. mother, Linda, also infected Covid-19, died three days earlier.


""It's raw,"" Jennings said interview, struggling keep composure son Brayden placed hand shoulder.
""Sometimes I'm grieving husband realize mom's gone. I'm grieving mom. think ... oh, I'm going go tell Dennis Dennis gone. two people would supportive ... know, they're gone.""


The sense loss leaves two sons feeling like they're drowning, said.
""As go down, we're trying push one back take breath,"" said. ""It way.... family gutted.""
Her son Brayden, attorney, lamented support mother also became infected.
""It's kind like we're broken, we're continuing break,"" said. ""And time got positive result that, took away support system. hospital, come hug mom get sick.""
Jennings son remembered Dennis strong ""full life."" becoming ill, dad beaten son pushup contest.


But, months warning husband deadly virus, Jennings watched lying stomach hospital bed. Moments died, bathed cut hair.
""And left him,"" said. ""There's nothing else. save either one them. people wear masks, want wear mask... got brought home. mom never left house. husband careful. Stop selfish. Stop selfish. That's all.""
In March, start first wave pandemic, Jennings talked husband much worse things going get.

""'Look me. going get bad. going get bad,'"" told him.
""I said, 'One us could die need hear need wear mask need hand sanitize. did... Mom stayed home eight half months. people everything right get hug mom go anywhere... still lost them. matter strong are. People like, 'Oh man, Dennis strong. He's going make it.' happens matter what. virus keeps winning."" can’t believe Biden hasn’t done anything stop happening. /s wondering well.

The covid cases map look like population density map, almost everyone clustered around Atlanta.

However, many rural counties states red, seems like anomaly. also happens important runoff, might factor.  national lockdown implemented conjunction business personal income support least two months could arrest spread disease.

Yeah. happened MARCH. ""because I'll stop sharing info it!"" It’s weird doctors offices hospitals still ask questionnaires “have recently country?” Guys, dangerous one! basically county sozeable population people like sports, except back summer. one gives shit anymore. defined months ago.

I can't find official definition quickly, here's indication definition December 2019, outbreak coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused virus SARS-CoV2, began Wuhan, China (1).

Sometimes, wrong would better right long Covid: best study seen app based self reported study might biased either way. found 13.3% symptoms lasting 1 month, 4.5% 2 months 2.3% 3 months. Covid probably wasn’t virus passed around.... georgia mostly clear?? call bullshitz absolutely right, agree 100%. need careful people misread comment saying nobody else could done better. mind, State Wisconsin lied people 12/1 actually go hospitals, we'll find 34% ICU beds state empty? It’s not, reddit banning people saying little ridiculous us

.....whelp. 13 European countries higher per capita death rate? US response really bad comparatively?  find level research preparation.

That's incorrect (and insulting) people attending science fairs ""level research preparation"". everything else winging failing spectacularly. Trump even tried find cure Covid live TV using bleach UV rays. understanding time, allowed.

I still think stupid allow / patronize indoor dining back then, isn’t bad others literally gone laws passed.  shirt and, recently, dress. love pattern illustration herd immunity. worn rarely since pandemic started, mainly I'm feeling angry. Early on, wear times easy indicate dots shoulders show close someone who's among vulnerable population. ""if 100,000 200,000 (deaths), together done good job.” - idiot

He must proud overachieving much. many republicans get away killing many american citizens. Lol another 4 month old minion account ramping propoganda replies. Carry on.  shit smoke clears sounds kinda cool southern areas aren’t dense terms concern level? Lower population? Yeah.

That would take strong federal leader, ""chief' executive, will.

Someone identify problem, choose plan attack, get everyone board whatever means possible. Bargaining, negotiating leaders state level compel whatever steps necessary save lives.

There's Sept 11th twice week last 6 months getting worse.  Nobody fixed sharpie? simple blood test? It'll go away, it'll magically go away... like job. team whole week, finish first day back. may able clear backlog 8-9 days. work weekend make it.

Good friends active local Christian church happy church closed understood accepted it.
You need public understand respect public health advice, advice consistent, unambiguous supported political leadership, got decent shot it. Every state’s vaccine plan available online, Google free took hippopotamus oath. Ok, really need leaked map tell us that.

Shoutout anyone else currently virus, wish best health. thing fun. hate it.  funny holier thou shitting China saying hiding numbers. seems weirdly optimistic. never around many people space extended period time. guess warped sense people spend time can't see people catching way. free speculate whatever like. I'll trust official HHS site directly updated weekly. Leaked? whole ceiling broken. Healthcare workers, yes!

But other, irrational! 
Vaccinate nursing home staff instead. Keep nursing residents bubble.

Vaccinate high risk individuals able move job aka elderly. risk due going work. Also, vaccinate high risk individuals essential job. see elderly people working Target, Walmart, supermarkets, gas stations, etc. need protection theyre constantly exposed. nursing home residents. 
If nursing home residents become infected, family. According article, unanimous healthcare workers. hesitated nursing homes, current vaccine candidates tested people older 85, may work well them, also thought maybe vaccinating nursing home staff would enough.  going poll reportedly found...  50% knew someone tested positive, 50% didn't.  really true?  way knowing. one half million people worldwide would say contrary.  know alot nurses act like know everything vaccines take it. Eventhough vast majority nurses educated make vaccine processes involved. even doctors trained well either. real scientists years research experience actually field educated. 
Just cause position medical field mean expert everything medicine.
That's specialties. Well one side “it’s hoax, it’s scam hurt me! Fake news, economy tho!” person power nothing watched. . Blah blah pull bootstraps blah blah thats super covid appears I'd settle affirming 88% much larger 66% there's fundamental issue data integrity HHS. need stop this. Expect April June regular people. That's 5 7 MONTHES AWAY!!!! Almost long pandemic been. People already fatigue making sound like time start celebrating dangerous. 2 dose vax well. medical workers get mid dec vaxxed mid Jan.

Its screwing everyone intentional consequences around larger hospitals search ICU bed. coronavirus cases soaring throughout Kansas, said, find single one. time bed opened elsewhere following day, young man near death. 

Do consider ""rationing care"" staffed ICU beds? people care, don’t care enough. remember seeing nurse talking denying exists dying it. Saying flu, etc. one gets free pass passively kill maim people perceived liberty “infringement.” It’s made political smart people trick gullible losers. kinds laws one cares all, masks different. It’s become issue “freedom people” never understood freedom really means. selfish version it. 

These types people always say “well make choice stay inside forever” that’s reasonable thing Americans do. pay rent? buy food?

What's happening overwhelmed hospitals they're telling people self-monitor home come condition worsens, including O2 levels drop certain point. People deteriorate return hospital put supplemental oxygen - either nasal cannula mask - they're given additional medications reduce risk, they're monitored. Covid patients need supplemental oxygen decompensate *extremely* quickly need monitored needs change. ""supplemental oxygen"" stage seems step entirely glossing activity summary, that's 410 covid patients coming from.

If patient's condition continues worsen, they'll (hopefully) get moved ICU - assuming bed found. ICU, they'll monitored closely treated aggressively. continue deteriorate, they'll put ventilator. [Note ventilator ""heal"" covid, buys time patient's body fight own.] rare cases, *if* patient's condition prognosis warrants it, *if* resources available, patient continues deteriorate might put ECMO given lung transplant. extreme, scarce, resource-intensive strategies tiny, *tiny* percentage covid patients receive.  imagine 280,000 sentences.... heartbreaking.

With pandemic, money object. funding even think running trial. anything covid related goes trip pile review. factors alone shave well year time. Every minute, American gone

Intentionally Rounding population usa 330million (yeah, bit much) 

330,000,000 / 60 = 5, 500, 000 hours

5, 500, 000 / 24 ~ 230, 000 days

230, 000 / 365 ~ 630 years

USA founded 244 years ago

And still idea going. Well probably know 100% corresponds usual level care per patient per bed per staff.

Covid patients need approx 2x care 3x longer average, 100% occupied beds actually far higher 100% capacity. always ask, hospital toss coagulation samples day next day. one kind storage space. think ones reports research samples kept special conditions. Trump winning display.

There’s never mRNA vaccine like before. There’s precedent. government isn’t bastion infallible opinions/policies. 

I plan get vaccine. eyes people nervous COVID vaccine aren’t people don’t want kids get immunizations autism. There’s overlap groups, know plenty pro-vaccine people nonetheless nervous speed vaccine. can’t really blame them. science background. decade ago, talking mRNA vaccines future reality intro microbiology classes (and think talked class took medical virology). Although vaccines new, technology development since 1989. Read excited hopefully try one mRNA vaccines. think design potentially makes effective. code spike protein, target immune system specific. However, ones use adenovirus vectors (e.g. Oxford vaccine), there’s possibility immune system target vector instead spike protein Covid. happens, won’t get protection Covid. me, biggest drawbacks mRNA vaccines logistics distributing them.

I understand thought mRNA vaccines freaks out, someone biomedical research background (and avoids unnecessary risks), want know I’m willing wanting take :) Reddit mythical view Canada shit ton racists, misogynists, bigots, around shit people. tend little quieter ones south (although that’s changing).

While health care decent social safety nets place, aren’t anywhere near good people lot progressive European countries. . OP, you’re good dude map actually helped calmed bit. default scared crap reduced number people group.

Thankfully area Westchester, NY masks enforced public spaces wear K95 even around non-maskers. People don’t care more, don’t know surprises anyone upsets them. Show someone map entire US red they’re likely going say fuckit might well live life point everyone’s going it. Unfortunately y’all sub speak general public vocal minority. people don’t care much more. Yeah, that's $150 Canadian dollars. That's like $20 USD, really. ;) mainly picked Toronto Vancouver close Seattle, I'd never lived east coast. still late move here, even covid all. could (through work transfer), too. :^D Downplay pandemic march prevent panic. Keep public uninformed prevent panic. Spread false information prevent panic. Hype Pfizer/Moderna development subdue panic. words, stonks plebians. mmm, Combos  didn’t even know late February. didn’t seem real may. feels REALLY real I’m positive.. banger way end year. Aren’t Americans considered obese morbidly obese? Isn’t one biggest factors? 

So whole thing everyone going back lives people “pre existing conditions” go die corner” - well that’s Desantis put jail life. Almost million cases almost 20k deaths greedy scum gets live rest life luxury? Everything getting damn dark. 70% weren’t spending 12 hours car together! We're plague colony. Um, shit. 
Can't travel anywhere without quarantine Covid test. I'm sure constructive thread participants operate utmost civility. fucking moronic, traitorous, psychopathic loser caused deaths quarter million Americans.

FTF You. Yes agree. Back March thought pandemic would end life knew several millions dead Americans. lot others felt way too.

Now know virus isn’t deadly unfortunately hospitals still overwhelmed. fatality rate less 1% crush health care system, imagine would happen fatality rate 10-15%! buy liquor local grocery store.....

How many really bad alcoholics fuck care drop dead? Completely avoidable. Thousands died needlessly. point article states amputations due neglecting health? Seems like may assuming that....

Now, many articles need grab healthy people dying dealing long term health affects? top head think go get you. reservation friend's name. Reservations transferrable. wife showed up, would've turned us away. Yes. people listen advice stayed home. Genius strategy... *everywhere* hot spot US **nowhere** hot spot. Georgia mostly non burden?? literally says 70% likely wrong could 50% Dungeon Master, bet real pain repeat Didn’t lockdown “two weeks” reason first place? Sorry, fuck anyone gathered last week, plans Xmas honestly. It’s shitty situation we’re in. Cross fingers hope normal holiday season next year, year call it. don’t know change behavior. random politician excellent health care chooses make bad choices, start complaining want make bad choice? Let idiots go dine fancy restaurants. I’d rather stay home wait COVID over.

How many political figures COVID now? curious, possible multiple trials different intervals, decided 28 better. doctor says 28 I'm going back day 28  Currently pregnant. scares shit me. I've def pushed aside symptoms I've idk hospitals could take in. 

(I'm fine btw, symptoms typical things) I've calling false news, like more.

Facebook ashamed even allowing it. mean yeah. nothing it, half population actively disbelieves exists and/or refuses wear masks freedom.... yeah, thing spreads. Leaked? already know that? Boris Johnson really ever regret anything though? entire career based upon “I’m fucking idiot can’t help *Goofy chuckle*” approach politicking. Yay, newly discovered sub day! think people act responsibly outdoor seating fine.

but people let guard down, especially drinking.

i know agree closing outdoor dining, seeing cases go want to.... stupid take. mother probably embarrassed birthed exceptionally dumb ass. Health care workers nursing home goes together state kid day care year now, get sick every month guaranteed. Maybe more. far Covid. least according tests. work hospital totally infested wife takes public transport nyc. dodging bullets daily. People comply pretty well hasn’t gotten bad since first outbreak recently. Still lot better though. Hope doesn’t get much worse us. We’re retarded though we’ll lock need to. California start imposing strict regulation it’s late. Unfortunately political cost imposing harsh measures severe could cost governors towards prevention positions. Cost US 

The cost dose ranges from $3 $37, depending vaccine.
Moderna, two-dose vaccine, recently announced dose go around $32 $37.
The Pfizer vaccine, also given two doses, expected cost $19.50 dose.
Each dose Johnson &amp; Johnson’s two-dose vaccine cost estimated $10, AstraZeneca’s two-dose vaccine could cheapest $3 $4 dose.
Novavax’s two-dose vaccine estimated $16 dose.
No individuals — regardless whether they’re uninsured, private health insurance, Medicare Medicaid — pay pocket vaccine itself, federal health officials previously stated.
“Vaccine doses purchased U.S. taxpayer dollars given American people cost,” the Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source states.
Certain vaccine providers may charge administration fee giving shot, individuals fee reimbursed.
“Vaccine providers get fee reimbursed patient’s public private insurance company or, uninsured patients, Health Resources Services Administration’s Provider Relief Fund,” CDC live Australia, never questions whether vaccines would free here. 

Never worry paying test, treatment I'd never go hospital too. would definitely like know info. Death Panel jobs stolen gay immigrants abortions kneeled National Anthem. basically sums up. Might even take 12 weeks. guess 10 weeks, America caught it. Totally shocked guy whining banned anti-social pos. accurate. I’ve hallucinated kidney stone pain before. sound like plug... upgraded Apple Watch specifically there’s O2 meter new one. gives piece mind constantly. Likely much cheaper solutions though. weirdest part spearheaded entire endeavour Trump well, tough president set bar low. Suddenly people start thinking ""they say"" valid argument wonder many people justified ""I wore mask!""

With numbers way are, knowing would get worse Thanksgiving, many people still chose sit cramped, enclosed space hundreds strangers fresh air hours. They'll shame anyone wearing mask (and people definitely deserve shamed) without ever admitting they're treating mask- ever designed used conjunction measures prevent transmission- complete shield keeping everyone else safe. go family home even keep mask around people they're spending time statistically they're likely infect. 

Those people much leg stand comes lecturing others. mask free pass get around sensible measures whatever want getting feel superior. Thank people choose put dangerous environments begin one single holiday season. deserve credit many virtue signaling people claiming themselves. 40% nealthcare workers seem certain accept vaccine 3rd party audit peer reviewed trial data..





P interesting see happens 3 weeks.

Not really. obvious would happen since March. countries gone national lockdown working prevent: Basic triage procedure.

People left die sake others better chance surviving. either larger amount people die nobody gets treatment need time. include covid patients, cancer patients anyone else would survived ailments appropriate timely treatment.

The ""Obama Death Panel"" projection comes true GOP creation. Trump's handling pandemic borderline genocidal. cancelled Christmas gatherings already need now. mean could told hope vote out

That happen. reelected 60% votes I’m internet stranger, hopes you. wish speedy uneventful recovery. Maine going repopulate anything, going avoid excess deaths (barring holiday season go). moved Lubbock last weekend haven’t left Rockwall yet finish stuff here. went weekend find house lack mask everywhere disturbing. Nah. sad it’s still exceptionally rare. It’s anomaly anyone scared age without known high risk diseases cut society. Absolutely not! Canadians welcoming amazing (Thunder Bay, Ontario). loved two trips come COVID-19.

America become hostile. Sad true. end Florida first? Covid climate change? shows people taking seriously. Troll alert can't believe Obama allowed happen. Thanks Obama. kidney stone. managed get ER right pain went 10/10. Can't imagine calling around ERs state. Santa Clara County allowing 49ers play practice there. What’s even supposed accomplish? thats reading fine print **clearly says numbers reported yesterday**. suspect intentional. really amazing adaptable though, it? Nope. Keep kiddo home, too. daycare likely following local protocols, balance public safety keeping businesses open. Help public safety side. Well it’s either eventually get potentially die/kill others covid. Oh god, mother despise it. hate use word “they.” Man showed solo rode it. Tickets already paid for. still even today 13 European countries higher daily death totals US does, twice three times bad

Of 13 countries higher death rates, think ignoring countries less 3000 deaths eliminates 4 add discussion anyway.


Next, would guess long time since Peru close Europe. Similarly Mexico, Argentina, Brazil Chile.

I hope find dismissive say Bosnia Herzegovina comparable USA terms goals expectations. 


Instead expect America elite due resources, expertise, frankly, advantage location. Instead, list ""bottom 4 comparables"". 


You knew asked. community different turn around times depending site go to. Ranges 3-4 days 7 days. pretty rural part PA though. Hey, home town makes top comment. mean, it’s good reason we’ve made made it. one ever knows us. We’re little county next Dallas time. normally tell people we’re Dallas. aint secret, yo. Lotsa fluids take easy. Wasn’t worst bug I’ve definitely sucked. 13 European countries higher per capita death rate? US response really bad comparatively?

You knew asked. NATIONAL MASK MANDATE NOW! hear out: 

We actually slow spread. Right now. 

They're deploy vaccine. Prevent deaths, save healthcare system, bail businesses, enforce mandates keep grocery workers safe. 

Vaccinating grocery workers slow deaths spread, particularly places masks mitigation measures place. Imo people working ERs EMTs highest risk, take care patients prior getting tested wear PPE take care covid positive pts everyone usually ones get exposed. least covid icus nurses aware positive wear correct PPE, isn’t 100% full proof, probably got sick myself. critical thinking also reinforced home likely stick school, unfortunately. OAN know Trump seen definitely chose name something AOC category get attention Damn, I'm sorry TB. never met anyone that's always think disease past. Thank sharing story. people know one person. die, test positive, make information public, family 10+ could count knowing someone tested positive. could 30+ people work department. another 10 used volunteer people used around gym classes. basically previously healthy grandfather stroke died two months ago. gave up. 2 lithotripsy me. first kidney stone 16 There’s lady neighborhood forum states fake information facts constantly asked got information it’s always Trump. Surprised automod hasn’t killed post already. It’s actually good health care workers reluctant get vaccine right away. get vaccinated side effects advertised, doctors nurses need take sick day two recover. teach in-person CPR tomorrow. I’m going double mask put PM95 (I think that’s they’re called) mix, I’m admitting students aren’t wearing masks. put announcement let know spent time people outside households Thanksgiving break quarantine two weeks.

No one contacted me. least one them, statistically speaking, ignored safety guidance. I’m scared silly. Oh wow, knew bad absolutely terrible. Sorry, also don’t validate parking So, I’m bit confused here. dakotas high rate everyone must know someone died it, several others vent month. That’s ny. really care? Even still? really staying home wearing masks? Still? That’s unconscionable. Serves right attending event urgent, necessity, could've waited. Born dead man's town

Less year ago said ""SARS killed 800 nothing panic about"". Well looks like move Hawaii...except account red need Fred Daphne. remember getting text day saying Rhode Island Hospital reached capacity. I'm pretty sure that's still case, since they've started putting people Rhode Island Convention Center. US vaccinate free. It’s part first stimulus. beginning pandemic animals died. Don’t wanna let sheeple panic guess. Hospitals absolutely trained that. worked retirement community checked people there. couldn’t send anyone hospital put infected residents purpose room. area live literally can’t take another patient, essentially start picking choosing dies. I’m tired people treating virus like it’s movie tv series everyone happy ending. 45+ wasn’t even mentioned remember. idea. masked, outdoor graduation might allowed happen teachers vaccinated news, guy makes donation St Steve's house totally fucked big wall around USA small yard door next Tijuana nice mini park swing North border Canada. Sorry, neighbor, us Steven sick right can't come play untill cough dead. deceptively clever. people catch on? takes awful lot urine anyone notice. It’s case America since March. Right? Meanwhile idiot local community sharing petition defy governor’s orders reopen local restaurants 50% capacity. neighbors buying it, guy still thinks whatever wants vulnerable stay home. why? safe ways leave house. That’s lit understand sentiment, careful get complacent. Influenza still big deal kills lot people year, children elderly. double normal flu season year would still terrible health system citizenry. really strive kick thing butt drive close zero possible. Flu matter. understand lockdowns - hopefully vaccines therapeutics. covid affected you, money &amp; there. exactly looking for? always wearing mask? I'm trying convince gf wearing mask gurantee 100% protection. hanging people different households multiple times week. So, work long term health care, largest facility saw nearly 100% infection rate. Isolation impossible type population is. Ppe unavailable refused clients. Yet didn’t bounce back fourth, type immunity. 

We’ve cases there, hasn’t flared second time facility. Hoping stays way. However depts getting flare ups staff level now. People eat lunch together work closely. easily spread staff, especially precautions aren’t closely followed. spoke people Covid say like flu. suppose different strains virus effect people differently. Nevertheless, still strive avoid contracting virus risks described many different people before. don’t travel folks! I’m probably minority didn’t like all. even tried second time sure missing something no.  sort 'some cultural legacy guiding us beyond control led inevitable disaster' argument. sort thing politicians said WW1. useful trusted keeping lid things get jail free card.

The truth Greece cancelled carnivals one infection, going things normal 700 people hospitalised daily basis. That's something far different notion 'British Exceptionalism'.

None due 'British Excpetionalism' inevitable. result decisions made face near certain impending disaster. actually got vaccine myself.  went May 2020 Oct 2020 May 2021; I’m hoping May isn’t optimistic! :/ Good man, thank Bold move, CDC. Let's see pays off. new normal, yes. old normal, no! Less 1300 cases last year one changed lives. Vaccines work. still reject donors gay lived Europe? Healthcare workers ""1a"" meaning ""1b"" etc. educate bit resorting angry cursing. Worth sadly anti-science people say ""they drop infections zero percent, proof lockdowns work"" le sigh... played “bubble” cities, think really feasible way possibly keep sports going right now. lol it’s good. shouldn’t fooling around coronavirus subreddit. promise I’m usually pretty sincere, least here. 

Vladimir *Lenin* follower Marx helped begin USSR. knowledge, author quote originally responded to. 

John *Lennon* Beetle wrote Walrus. 

A now-common joke film *The Big Lebowski* plays this. It’s great film I’d recommend anyone who’s stressed able take couple hours off. knew someone would make comment like this.:) ""brownie"" brownie would found entirely different car sit in!  future job prospects it. 


It's high time entitled people know actions consequences.  I’m still going gym use sanitizer several times course way out, til get home wash hands. also keep bottle car pump gas leave store. Better nothing Nothing over. vaccines wont anything Absence evidence isn’t evidence absence hold hands

No! Social distancing! /s wanna pants-less, nudist weirdo rubbing butthole things like cat! =P nobody believes data comes Russia. alway agenda.

If vaccine great, 4 months approved - given half Russian population ? think least silver lining grateful little things like return got man smh. Like it’s rule number one Thats arrests work NY now. pre-pandemic change. Huh, almost huge national problem needs federal response. Crazy, know!  plenty humans suffering miserably 100 years time.  least 50% America underemployed. I'm saying wrong issue needed fixing long time. It’s college professional level. K-12 even younger powering sports right now. don’t get it. Ridiculous.

It would *vaccine* even go doctor. Whenever break law declare autonomous. didn't. called bullshit statement can't defend :) homeless time last year ate ""soup kitchens""* lot. actually miss much felt nice share meal people even smelly(I probably too). 

*There actually one run sorta like upscale restaurant would expensive food. None like I'd imagined soup kitchen be. person gets vaccine cells start producing spike protein. seems quite safe short term, it’s protein, makes antigen.

Constant antigenic stimulation wreak havoc body. concerned auto-immune conditions body going overdrive get rid spike protein, coming body, hence people strong immune reaction get (day long migraines, severe fatigue, body aches, people told take day work getting it).

It drives insane seeing people bet everything brand new technology. FIRST mRNA vaccines ever, tested fewer 100,000 people, extrapolating results hundreds millions. It’s insanity. It’s insane healthcare workers first line get it, hurts we’re fucked.

I don’t think auto-immune stuff show early. like months years, scale hundreds millions.

I’m waiting old school vaccine boring delivery method targeting well known part coronaviruses worked well past. There's also required second dose that's weeks apart. This. 

A friend flew Costa Rica bit fun I'm disappointed them. I'm Chrome well. even see link incomplete blue stopping ""-outbreak)"". click get 404.  protest (non violently) inconvenience they'll care. lobbying bribery get attention. research suggesting people 40 asymptomatic?

IIRC last research paper read subject, rate truly asymptomatic infections (as never symptoms whatsoever entire length infection) 1.5 5%, others presymptomatic tested/ surveyed... eventually develop symptoms, lot people symptoms easily mistaken allergies headaches. think covid big deal contracted it, view disease changed?  I'm trying troll looking trolls. I'm curious still think big deal, worse expected be. though? Would honestly upset kill serial killer? Would forget within week? month? year? They’re dead. Can’t effect anything anymore. given short amount time. 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 years forgotten. can’t forget effected now. have. TrUsT sCiEnCe Yep! know OBGYN Rhinebeck expecting vaccinated late december. Super jealous, probably able get one late 2021. want go public without afraid I'll kill someone so. Well Rona spread fecal matter suspect folks nasty bums. That's think actually might need. One issues get lot fluid buildup eyes, although 90% right eye, bad ear too. seems happen towards evening though. think allergies cause cats. them, I'd tearing day. ""tears"" burn like crazy. I've cried before. eyes burn cry. sure shit burn happens. I'm doctor knowing right eye right ear issues, there's tubing, drainage connects stuff, related.

I see ent got steroid ear shots. Hard tell worked natural recovery occuring. Cause hearing come back. tinnitus never fully went away clogged ear feeling. be. Remember Trump told us afraid virus recovered? Tell 2,600 died yesterday. January cannot come soon enough. Everyone stay place much possible minimize risk still work public. walking circle jerk I’m missing? spelt Lennon wrong?  40% Americans poverty prior pandemic, 60% two paychecks poverty large majority lack form savings. point lack safety net feature god damn fetiah us US. 

And yes, numbers higher now. properly vaccinated month initial injection. 
My prediction life UK/Europe return less normal may/june. Ha ha, diabetes. hmm works fine desktop chrome browser though even now. thanks though.. someone still come shopping them. still people instacart whatever coming potentially getting workers sick. seen product floating around big house lately? Let Covid games begin! New wrinkle. interesting. I’m sure get accomplished. Articles today dripping envy sour grapes Russia's UK's rapid vaccine  Right? Doctors, nurses, first responders work holidays.... can't top current COVID-19 outbreak, Shamattawa dealt spike tuberculosis cases since last summer, Redhead said. Tuberculosis, TB, infectious disease typically impacts lungs. Specifically put bubble ensure nobody contracted virus. players hated experience refused go process again, NBA bubble 2021 season, NHL actually returns either (among reasons, mainly impractical play entire season bubble). Good OK, well, mind disagreeing, get win disagree. people give fuck. people still working. unemployment rose never ""most people"". Exaggeration discussions harms everyone. upset keep working like people, missed limited benefits went unemployed people. time recognizing currently benefits job many unemployed people looking work, many never received benefits either.

He also supports business owners punishing employees valuing health reducing hours consistently they're forced quit. justified behaviors all. honest, looking what's going around world, seems UK needs vaccines Africa Asia. mean, Vietnam SEVEN new cases yesterday. country 97 million people. Well Trump basically abdicated playing golf time. weirdest thing actually remove mask. oxygen 88 - 91 % mask on. mask per se struggling breathe post-op. didn’t feel comfortable little surprised obviously continue wear masks leave house.   think year+ many shutdowns many countries brings us beyond point thinking overreacted. things often seem different hindsight. would require people level personal responsibility day went marina, got takeout local burger joint ate outside water. absolute heaven. time familiar inside restaurant. miss it. well tragedy certainly also anyone sport donuts get biscuit drink. Need go donating asap maybe thing miss cannot wait it! Well yeah understand that. Sooooo hopefully would counted phase 1 group. fair March death, faster others. Pretty sure Nobel prices several years come earned year. let’s fuckin go boyz big Jets fan, 0-11 worst team history football. 

Giving away tickets games draw many people.

Give ability fire coach manage draft, I'll donate kidneys blood get me. Yup. FIL getting unemployment checks pandemic made first place. spent weed, getting gun license new gun shooting range monthly fees, fixing lawn mower, buying shit didn’t need. 

Driving insane. runs soon he’s SOL, sympathy. trying say worse everybody else wrong. pandemic one single persons fault bitching people internet changing anything youre asshole. ever expect US goverment help us trippin state wants people die. much know thank you. bottom heart. Take never dealt Home Office? 

(It joke tbf right - British civil service historically well respected I'd argue exactly covered glory recently. 'Government' also commonly taken mean civil service Executive average person, appreciate constitutional distinction. INTP chance?)  Cmon Florida parents said thanks spreading virus too. dam Reality unfair personally. FDA ashamed approving yesterday. real quote anyway worry lol, got gist

for anyone  big part reason places like Taiwan Hong Kong done well experience SARS. big part South Korea done well put rigorous contact tracing program place MERS outbreak 2015. 

There’s reason believe world won’t learn anything pandemic. suppose nursing home resident contracts COVID, nobody else gets it? nursing home, one patient gets Covid, do. virus airborne hops room room. I’ve watched 30% patients die every nursing home I’ve worked year. reason we’re locking society reduce likelihood introducing virus nursing homes. 200,000 vaccines ready million well way! Hell ye trust west handle pandemic too. 

Clap clap. would close PAX Prime think (which usually late Sep/early Oct). doubt Penny Arcade staff pull events close together. I've done booths PAX east west that's hard enough they're spaced months apart, can't imagine team trying plan two entire conventions once! That's true! so, afraid risk. dad's health extremely fragile (although refuses acknowledge it) even smallest possibility creating situation endangers makes brain start rolling around skull.

I extremely anxious person nature, obviously fun situation around! problem.

Hungarians usually take ""mandatory vaccines"" childhood much way mandate, 7-10 vaccine shots child years. tuberculosis, etc.

 
Maybe that's 90% -- vaccines 90%+ vaccination. nature neoliberal news media normalize kind thing.

All articles acting baffled part it, acting like already normalized. stats that? 

Idk find out. Additional questions would be: old he? rate people age similar diagnosis non-covid years? pre-existing conditions? smoke? Latinx? Lmao

Also no, Canadian healthcare cheaper poor. That's it. That’s depressing thought, likely accurate. almost got like denying Chinese implemented lockdowns procedures pandemic. Lol aren’t racist. think Asians inferior race that’s lol. 
Mfs still live opium wars era. I'll probably get vaccine get one sandwiches.  Individual group life insurers can’t add riders policies refuse pay benefits someone dies specified illness like Covid-19, Insurance Compact’s Hunter said he’s aware state regulations stop insurance companies underwriting disease like Covid-19. survivors already denied policy tested positive.

Insurance companies suck. ways survive world without them.  Two weeks limit. 

This novel anymore, fun. I'm shit do, right? Way past teaching bake home improvement projects. *miss* life. miss dropping kid sitter hours going eat. miss vacation (or anyplace else). miss stopping bar cocktail work. Hell, miss going office.

But change anything. Still want COVID. So, know, show basic level toughness. comprehend fine. I'm unbelievably angry sad. politicians cannot.  whole point FDA particular emergency use wavers weigh risk versus reward ratio. It’s really matter pure science, it’s matter practical ethics, asking question benefits drug enough outweigh potential risks.

At point, unless data available public, anyone half rational brain conclude yes question.  insurance.  Hippocratic oath work way. 'leaked' shared State's Governors?

Or published CDC website(perhaps see it?) angry rona purpose movie 28 days later starts chance provide article? I've read dozens day free. Honestly.. remember all. (except ""ICU nightmares"".. I'll explain below)

I started coming symptoms around Friday March 13th,.. stayed home treating got bad enough called Ambulance late night March 23rd. thing remember Ambulance ride,. getting taken back Ambulance feeling wind blow across took Hospital doors. ventilate (intubate) somewhere around March 26 28th.. there's even pictures iPhone week (that remember taking). know that's trauma drugs whatever causing memory loss there. Also Nurses said came Oxygen Sat 68%.. quite possible effecting causing cloudy headedness memory loss ?

So really remember much 2 3 weeks all. (which probably thankful.. procedures like Ventilation 3-port Neck IV urine-catheter probably pleasant :) ... 

The thing intubation/ventilation put coma,. pump full heavy sedatives what's called ""ICU Deliriums"".. basically ""nightmares"" (and 16 days straight). fanciful bizarre (like Dr Strange movie).. could write ""imaginary"" easy discount them. Others mundane real everyday things several weeks that, really lost ability tell ""real"" ""imaginary"". 

It really interesting though.. even ""heavy sedatives"".. brain still taking inputs real world.. easily gets confused. 

For example

* One nightmares had... sleeping air-mattress (which use ICU roll lot help ease workload infected-lungs).. dream also diarrhea'd pants (also likely true poop-bag put butt ICU. 

* also distinct memory several nightmares ""choking things"".. I'm guessing times trying get Ventilator get breathing own. 

* also memories people asking basic questions (Name, you, here?).. pretty sure Nurses testing cognitive abilities checking see sedatives wearing coming back normality not. 

So part pretty heavy hard fight of. Waking (in old Pediatric childrens ward converted Covid19 unit).. little memory happened (except nightmares).. full tubes (3-port neck IV, Catheter, Heart-sticky monitors, nasal oxygen line, nasal-feeding tube).. really able move walk talk).. pretty overwhelming. Fighting physical side (getting tubes out, learning walk again,etc) challenging. also working nightmare memories (and isolation nobody allowed see me).. also pretty hard. 

The Hospital staff Rehab nurses,etc total amazeballs though. caring told good jokes even made mistakes like shitting bed missing toilet etc.. still champions (I funny memory 2 younger nurses helping go bathroom one clean ass commented ""Well.. really nice butt skin!"".. ha!.. 

Little victories day helped encourage keep fighting. Yes also usually healthiest. Older sicker people get much likely die. reason medical professionals getting first special. sick directly impacts standard care sick people getting. Since firefighters directly helping sick people, getting later old sick makes sense. Still haven’t seen full dataset Seems kind obvious, although think word ""rationing"" poor choice. great news sees ending spring! Water. Is. Wet. That’s wave that’s over. That’s capacity. point, hospitals can’t take patients, labs can’t process tests, etc. smaller infrastructure states, hit ceiling looks like you’re turning, reality system broken. I’m following info New York much since it’s far away doesn’t impact like South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska do. know bumping ceiling graphs little misleading don’t look mitigating factors. So, long story short. neighbor tested positive Covid-19. street's mail route house ""downstream"" infected neighbor's house meaning mail lady touches infected neighbor's mailbox right touches mailbox. stop crying call police?

Thanks gold advance. Mate, live Australia state, active case months state governments worked together common goal. Stop people dying disease Fine, get vaccine, that's choice. expect society applaud cater it.

You seem imply accept risk give social distancing, everything risky. inherently flawed viewpoint talking pandemic. ""Let's anything, everyone dies anyways, right?"" Slippery slope.

Doesn't really matter American, flawed perspective flawed perspective. argument people make is, outdated philosophy, many sides agree

The way things now, sound baseline, desperately needs 2020 rework. founding fathers intended. stagnant, change times. due. need change vaccines ended working probably would lost morale keep safe. point I'd rather get covid risk death/longterm health consequences instead locking years come still probably ending getting covid. Senate serves roll prevent large states controlling smaller states.

At expense allowing small states control large states. CA, TX, FL, NY, PA, IL, OH, GA, NC 50% population country. get 18% Senate's representation. smallest 25 states get 50% representation Senate, 16% population democratic republic state anonymity Senate allows this.

Anonymity? mean autonomy? Senate allow that. States get powers within borders due Tenth Amendment. Senate grant that.

It's Federal Body influences Federal Government. mechanism undemocratic gives disproportionate power small states regardless small population is.

Yes, influence federal laws policies affect individual states, Senate's power influence states remains whether Senators allocated equally among states, population. worried large states stepping autonomy small states, sane way rectify give small states ability step autonomy large ones, limit federal power sorry get think unfair point dual chambered legislature

Well, know wtf ""anonymity"" context, get unfair. system calling democracy, people outweigh political entities. That's plain simple. Nothing Senate limits federal power individual states. fact, areas Senate Executive bypass House Representatives (for example appointing members Federal Judiciary) Senate Electoral College serve give small states disproportionate power Federal Government large ones. market. Agreed. something better nothing.

but reality still 2/3 effective ones.

&amp;nbsp;

I learned country getting astrazenca (oxford) vaccine. I've reading it. 

Positives 

**PRICE**- 1/5 price Moderna 1/8 price Pfizer 
**storage**-fridge temps, exist around world. 

CONS

**effectiveness*** - around 65% effective, 1/3 chance getting virus come contact it. 


&amp;nbsp;

I think beginner, OK good. overall, want go Moderna price expensive crazy amount temps passable (-20 storage fridge temps 1 month). study, included 40 university students tested positive diagnosed mild moderate COVID-19, found majority (51%) continued experience symptoms complications 28 days later 30% experienced symptoms 50 days longer.

This first time I've seen someone actually put numbers this, opposed collection anecdotes. wish article would gone severity lingering symptoms, many symptoms severe enough impair daily living.  

Would also nice study involved 40 people, guess take get early game. Donald Trumps Twitter best. go again.

🗣 GET LIFE!  Yeah family something similar, lasting mid November mid Dec, including loss smell, dark blood, liver attacked (""by unknown virus""), coughing hard husband coughed blood, negative anything tested for. Could coincidence told since several doctors (cardiologist, infectious disease included) likely it. even mentioned us Dec possibility ""that new coronavirus"" testing available yet. Looking back old texts husband time, prompt care, noted lot people coughing terribly. told doctor lot people seemed have, testing negative flu must virus. 

So believe possible. many fail see God gave vaccine answer prayers. Really shitty way comparing data. year over. Furthermore, many deaths discovered year over. Further, comparing apples oranges. year unprecedented attempts keeping people safe healthy pandemic kinds trickle effects numbers. annoying. Reported. PS would that?

Get COVID-19 low risk category (most people are), irrelevant virus do. get choose limit.

I've living (as close to) normal life since June. Yeah I'm getting sick Fauci, Trump clearly rubbed him. day said there's reason keep kids schools. Seriously? Kids die! hard understand? So? wear seatbelt die car crash, mask die COVID. wouldn’t take easy steps protect everyone around you? Great thought.

Hell really 21st century repeat Spanish Flu. Thankfully top 1% smartest know now. vast majority humanity acted back then. anti-maskers look quickly people forgot something killed people WWI.

If anything world end worse. Cause we've seen massive corporations rake tons money. Inequality poverty risen dramatically, government debt risen, small businesses dying. Selfishness deflecting blame rise. surprised history continued repeat massive social unrest rise Fascism latter 2020s 2030s via butterfly effect. People forget everything year. corporations forget massive profits they've made. Truly historic achievement USA basically tied 13 countries. Sure, Belgium higher per capita death rate, hand 98 deaths one day, compared 2600 usa.  one really miss picture looking rates.

One worrying thing USA seems lag Europe 10 days so. still couple weeks death/day increasing.

A second even worrying thing, thanksgiving USA, followed quickly christmas season. Potential significant double bump. next 7 weeks. &lt;-""a coronavirus vaccine impossible!!""

&lt;-""If works take 5 years least!!""

After all, protecting hospital capacity, right?

Hope find largely driven panicky 20, 30 40 somethings massively overestimate risk dying this... IL able increase rent fast enough keep taxes. I'm barely making double digits month rental property job charity yet I'm forced due IL's excessive taxes.

Can't raise rent fast enough crazy laws help people global pandemic, making double digits profit month, yep definitely sounds like running charity. Hopes prayers you. wish increase influence worldwide stage, vacuum United States leaving it. Never let disaster go waste. Interesting, thanks! hadn’t seen anything addressing concern felt like different planet. I'm pretty sure meant increases risk death, anyone alive risk death. Curious, what's purpose posting this? totally understand would skeptical current administrations response vaccine. tons sources influenced administration clearly full green light vaccine. administration affect data produced vaccine studies/testing. clearly understand extreme benefits vaccine bring. would let current administration keep making educated decision? It’s like information isn’t there. relevant post? He’s oxygen rest life. stats that? 

Where stats hospitals overwhelmed seriously ill people treated?

Death isn’t bad outcome here. It’s reductionist act like bad outcome.

Someone posted yesterday able schedule urgent, life saving cancer surgery anywhere San Diego COVID. Where’s stats that? going Pittsburgh charging you? free riteaid. Padres good first time million goddamn years there. 

Also, yes, home series Astros disappointed miss  know. Exactly. pretend soon take vaccine run naked face sneezing everyone. Source? heard anything confirmed permanent damage, opposed long-term-potentially-permanent Well, shit. overcame covid young adult feel tired time. Hopefully get really bad complications. virus going destroy even people's lives thought. Exactly, right I'm looking forward next years celebrations. super far away something. Hopefully works to. It’s gonna media. affected us all. There’s already movie (although dramatic) made “about” Covid Theyre using products found lysol clorox sanitizing wipes.
Of course theyd work. issue strong chemicals. lead Western governments take communicable disease research seriously, socially people stop going work sick.

That’s trials thing. Trials pick short term effects unfortunately don’t necessarily catch long-term effects. Although it’s related (because it’s vaccine), example morning sickness pill distributed 1950s caused birth defects called thalidomide. People didn’t find 10 years, drug banned.

Same goes medical check-ups. stats, trust. Yes feel amazing this.

More like wondering anyone would unmasked we’re getting slammed cases. Yeah, works out, ""first"" right? Prior we've always simply let pandemics run course, vaccines diseases around decades. stamp COVID within ~2 years appearing, that's Moon Landing tier scientific achievement.  One way go defending wearing mask mask people without lecturing risking retaliation ( read news ) coming ‘friendly’ saying: fever want checked doctor case flu. Antimaskers mostly pro flu. It’s sounds little funny want avoid confrontation doesn’t remove mask. However I’m home approach doesn’t wear people. works we’ll see.  can’t keep pushing restrictive measures without showing light end tunnel. People stop listening take risk. tell that, healthy individual late 20’s need continue living way (actually *more* restrictive way, according proposal) return normal site ... response say, “to hell this. I’m living like anymore”. 

However, tell me, “don’t worry guys. I’m optimistic full life back point next year”, I’m inclined listen. Actually, I’m inclined even *more* cautious. That’s Calvary analogy good. 

I don’t know think negative, gloomy approach right one - super depressing, it’s counter productive. Yelling country 80% public right thing (don’t respond critiquing 80%, number really isn’t point) right thing way go.  Adding TN list places never move visit. friend I've known decades started super-paranoid COVID. canceled house cleaners 'only outside groceries walk people around wearing masks' things. skipped routine doctor/dentist appointments want risk it, going wait vaccine.

Now, though, he's changed. He's still cautious wears masks, flew Texas visit sister relatives three-household celebration. next month, he's flying Orlando see mom 4-5 days theme parks.

Now, issues that, people flying going theme parks airports theme parks taking precautions, like he's going clubbing stuff. find strange went 'do even want go routine doctor appointment vaccine' 'flying Disney World riding roller coasters' course this. Good news! US giving free Fauci honest cautious predictions.

Well. Sorta. He's said really dumb things hurt efforts. weeks ago said American people ""need they're told."" may correct, good way express this. Nobody likes talked though they're little child. people going listen message way. today says stadiums may open next year right predicted ""surge upon surge upon surge"" cases couple days ago. needs stop panic-porn. help large portion population thinks it’s blown.

I least understand well. whole ""wear mask"" utter debacle. zero training really use one. people wearing one day day out. Shoving pocket, purse, hanging rearview mirror. Putting on, taking off, putting back again. Handling 30 things Target putting hands face adjust mask.

There minimum standard constitutes mask. could N95. could neck gaiter one cut 20-year-old t-shirt. rules around them. wear front door restaurant table, take off. get go bathroom something, put back on. nobody look say ""this makes perfect sense."" ludicrous. There's magic bubble covid-free air around table.

It's make people skeptical. Without clear guidance training free-for-all that's many people taking seriously should. terrible look, incredibly stupid, ultimately shameful - French Laundry? Literally, “to die for.” photographer catch moment.

We could theoretically wipe HIV generation tested everyone gave current treatment every single positive person right now.  guinea pigs then. petty clear made mind I'm going change it, I'll respond others might reading.

You're incorrectly using term ""interim."" clinical trial set they'll decide ahead time (with input approval FDA US trials) many cases need among people trial unblind data see vaccine effective. That's primary endpoint (there multiple primary endpoints focusing different things- efficacy, side effects, different populations, etc- different stages trial). 

They'll also pick point (again, input FDA) un-blind data look trial going- *that's* interim analysis. 

For pfizer vaccine interim analysis supposed reached 32 confirmed cases trial. discussion FDA decided wait 64 cases trial interim analysis. Due fall surge cases actually overshot bit, interim analysis 94 confirmed cases. data reported Nov 8th. 

For pfizer vaccine primary endpoint COVID-19 Phase 2/3 participants without evidence infection vaccination [ Time Frame: 7 days second dose study intervention end study, 2 years ]

Their goal 170 confirmed cases reach primary endpoint (note ""up 2 years"" long reach many confirmed cases). data reported November 18th. 

The next step primary efficacy endpoint reached [apply FDA emergency use authorization data trial given FDA (NOT press release). Scientists physicians FDA’s Center Biologics Evaluation Research examine data rigorously review it. several steps involved within FDA (outlined link above) granted EUA. clinical trial done properly data sufficient quality, EUA approved. unlikely, however, since FDA involved approving experimental protocols every step way. 


Now, say clinical trial totally finished- isn't! primary endpoints still working (the major outstanding ones relate adolescents respond vaccine). also secondary outcomes need considered. get interim final outcome data come. finish get full FDA approval. 

Eventually, clinical trial also published peer-reviewed journal (this process takes several months, waited thousands people would die meantime). Given severity pandemic, clinical trials undergo rigorous review regulatory bodies like FDA, waiting peer review publication making vaccine available would unethical. 

There lot still know. example, alluded to, know vaccine prevents infection SARS-CoV2, virus causes COVID-19, disease. However, primary secondary goal Pfizer clinical trials. study needed, sure, that's claims nothing interim analysis data back up. nurse speaking mentioning side effects include feeling little sick might deter people getting second dose, may something comes up. understand they're jailed. young. 
But big discrepancy. One thing jailed local PD.
Another getting incarcerated crime, driving infections state penitentiaries. wouldn’t worth it... would spend $19 Islanders payroll? one thing need help understanding...can't nation produce vaccine copying formula phizer moderna approved? Phizer approved UK, country copy formula distribute it. Inside Science great throughout, alongside Less Science Action. programmes valuable whole BBC News operation. think you’re overestimating Lions 2008. 16 losses row! Vaccine diplomacy! needed patients thats held party. sort thing! fever? go get tested. there's answer. nitpicking. made situation insult try invalidate them. wording problem. said better way. Nice hypocrisy calling condescending though behaved :) Hahaha

One year someone got fined. Good stuff   Chairs exist. ear plugged need drained? suffer severe case Eustachian tube dysfunction seeing 3 ENTs ended helping seeing chiropractor. could pop ears get drain. Steroids nothing hear ear tubes make worse. It’s worth shot! hope feel better soon! That’s appeal authority bias, reality full trial data compiled trial still well underway, investigators seen small slice unblinded data, ~100 patients trial 30k 0.33% participants. 

Feel free review clinicaltrials.gov page. point stands. You’ve misinterpreted information you’ve given that’s really fault, presented cause exact effect. WTAF? think Dolly donated huge sums toward vaccine research home state choose something stupid. posted bail—where germs? Hong Kong Flu lasted 18 months. pandemics do. Whether fight not, whatever reason. Dude. ""Covfefe"" forgotten. last time thought Sean Spicer, Ukraine, Stormy Daniels, ""alternate facts,"" literal-nuclear discussions open air Mar Lago, Kellyanne ""Alternate Facts"" Conway *literally endorsing Ivanka's fashion line urging CNN viewers visit Ivanka's e-commerce site live interview*?   fact we've got results several phase 3 trials, without ADE, evidence absence. fact give convalescent plasma (hypothetically antibodies would trigger ADE) people disease without triggering ADE evidence absence.

I think know phrase means. think it’s different randomly eating skittles might laced cyanide. That’s risk depends lot factors age, health, risk factors, much you’ve exposed virus etc. people don’t want die, risk seems super low individual, going less afraid getting it. always risk dying moment, whether it’s car crash brain aneurysm covid. people risk seems low(for them) it’s really worth worrying about. people aren’t going want spend lives worrying ways could die. Maybe reasons justified maybe not. don’t know gunna post long, condescending reply seem like kind guy needs last word, won't.

Carry on, friend. try clothes buying used joke New Orleans, instead parking tickets, cops gave Saints tickets. Lol. Times change - funny incentive moment. Yes too! Dr John Campbell amazing teacher doctor! Even so, still good idea get checked out. Especially considering everyone's body reacts differently virus. (As we've seen asymptomatic fever-less cases.) Sanitizer still great gotta drive anywhere. keep pump bottle driver's side cupholder car. Note: meant say ***“December 31st, 2021.”*** preexisting condition, catch Covid, O2 saturation likely drop average person, also likely harder time recovering. maybe need control preexisting conditions. found 51% Black, 53% Hispanic 51% Native American workers hold job must done in-person, compared 41% White workers. slightly higher share Asian workers, 42%, also hold in-person high-contact jobs.

Second paragraph Yeah it’s really good, tier chic fil imo. Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine, they're selling cost production, believe licensing cost anyone else wants manufacture it. Let's hope trials validate it, massively speed rolling vaccine poorer parts world, cost production difficult distribution lower, also huge production already underway. [nice getting passed around back beginning someone living Hong Kong SARS stuck this. bit stood (I'd reread could, apparently free articles) mentioned reached mask one day sort feeling come need anymore.

*Cognitive dissonance*, coined Leon Festinger 1950s, describes discomfort people feel two cognitions, cognition behavior, contradict other. *I smoke* dissonant knowledge *Smoking kill me*. reduce dissonance, smoker must either quit—or justify smoking (“It keeps thin, overweight health risk too, know”). core, Festinger’s theory people strive make sense contradictory ideas lead lives are, least minds, consistent meaningful.

There’s rapid test every too, we’re getting work next week testing everyone weekly going forward. stop lot bs hopefully. getting vaccines soon too, I’m really excited tbh. Recommend? RECOMMEND? Oh jesus Christmas (I accepted autocorrect haha). Seems like assault charge least. Short answer print it.

Longer answer truly idea happen. amount government held debt, globally, unprecedented human history. uncharted territory. hang next pandemic. reason people support sweden they're white.

So mid late january everyone got covid Christmas starts getting sick dying. I'm guessing we'll seeing 4000+ dead day.  gives pause they're disregarding experts telling them.

It give pause situation might overblown. states sudenly become competent consistent? Kinda hesitant expect even baseline level acceptable here... everything It'd likely horrifically worse preventative measures taken. say take off, nuke Orbit. way sure /s Outdoor dining open since June.

Thanks solving this! California’s issue acute low number beds population, run faster. “they” weren’t, lol. can’t believe people still believe stuff, it’s almost year interesting see perspective. honestly mind pandemic outside fear getting sick providing average time infection symptom onset. fast test results coming back states days.

""I gloves I'm prepared covid""

\*attends 50 member thanksgiving family dinner\* wanted share anecdote. I'm 23 year old male. COVID months ago now, illness practically nothing (hint sore throat, cold symptoms half day), damage lungs apparent. COVID, could comfortably run 2-3 miles \~8:00 pace. Now, I'm still unable run full mile without stopping catch breath. Also interesting, fact completely lost sense taste smell, happen shortly infectious period ended. Months later, I'd say recovered 85-90% things, still back normal possibly never be. fuck keep using population Senate.

I keep bringing population Senate's structure prevent large majority stepping small minority, that, allows small minority happen represent majority states step large majority. instance, cure **worse** problem trying solve. obvious concrete example Federal Judiciary, whose members last four years appointed Executive representing minority population approved Senate majority representing minority population. goal prevent large states infringing rights small ones, succeeded. goal prevent Federal Government infringing rights states general, state allowed set rules based states needs.

You're confusing devolution powers states Senate reason. There's nothing structural Senate allows states make unfair,

A body gives say, ~1.6 million people Dakotas twice input body works 39.9 million people California unfair 39.9 million people. guess argue system would give power 9 states 41 unfair 41 states. I'd argue simply care. Individuals important states, legislative system represent that.

In scenario large states undue say internal affairs smaller states, care, issue would Federal Government power affect internal affairs states. skewing Senate towards small states, give power small states, gets wielded large issue House caps membership.

I issue well, that's actual tractable problem require amendment, priority. House gets expanded, population's influence Electoral College would increase well. might alleviate problem, restore balance issue, gripe States political entities rights within borders. Federal Government via Senate gives power outside borders.

Same. pester hell neg. oblige 99% time job flexible save lives. hope cases start fall get ""free"" immunity due vaccines. point technically safe, case numbers low pretty safe anyway. spot outbreaks there, they'll get rarer rarer easy contact trace. low level concern quite while, think settle back thing aware of, huge concern. vaccine isn’t effective less 70-80% population doesn’t get it. Oh doubt it'll start going spring, can't imagine we're going vaccinated quite while. I'm hopeful vulnerable people vaccinated spring though :) I'll take today, FDA even approves it. Dude know lockdown is. absolute number, yes. people viewing linear spread, they’ll expect linear slowdown immunity builds. 

In reality you’ll fewer smaller hot slots, still hot spots, misinterpreted lot people meaning disease must spreading high rate. think afraid covid?

If not, not!?!? guy also involved 14 vaccines coming market career. literally vaccine superstar. concerned...

What think first thing managers did? Check social media.. course partying shit dangerous working.

Employer 100% able trash hours quit situation like that. Username checks out. know you’re saying that. That’s you’re moron. No. Everyone gone Easter give perspective what's possible direction. Singapore 270 sq.mi. 5.9 million people. They've 29 deaths Covid... Since January. article

“To clear, know yet COVID-19 vaccines actually prevent infection transmission, symptomatic cases illness.”

Why taking don’t know first? may get tested. Region Östergötland testing public time 21% positivity rate. could due lack testing whole could also people within prioritized groups higher positivity rate general. theoretically less testing public could increase positivity rate even number tests totally increases. tell one people people die probably won't, there's nothing wrong far concerned. No, there's outright limit much raise rent given time. last 15 years slow decline profit taxes gone consistently dramatically. pandemic issue ya dolt. make world better place die trying. time. know I've ever defended administration seems like plan. legitimate make decision many vaccines go leave State require state decide number vaccines  parents work healthcare we've seen outside since march (except couple times staying hunt early am, masked room) kind assumed anyway. surprised extended family understanding, think seeing busy helps people understand. Including people sub. They're ignoring what's going right now. Agreed. Looking death rate fact period vaccine rollout probably say lot states made, chose make, decisions. comforting thought I'm poor live Texas Idaho. still likely get long-term damage bunch tissues/organs. Brain fog exhaustion lasting months, able move much, etc. Bars closed schools open isnt unreasonable leaves winter early spring still need take seriously.

I'm fine part May. Others give shit. Hell surprised US reaches natural herd immunity. People got immunity Spanish flu around time winter 2nd wave.  Legit this. I'm healthy younger surely older people already opportunity get already, choose that's them. I've stayed indoors done everything protect vulnerable, part. think clmdd meant wear masks forever matter what, get sick af. expert tell this- how's efficacy calculated? - number people contract virus non placebo/ total number people non placebo times 100? Technically modeled CHAZ:

CHOP = Capitol Hill Occupied Protest

CHAZ = Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone

Both place, name evolved Besides sadness trying live though pandemic hear deaths caused, greatly saddens know I'm surrounded many selfish Americans think themselves. real lol

""nooo never trust Chinese, trust Western institutions utterly failing shitting pants last year!!!""

I'm sure it'll work fine. China reason dastardly spin moustache kill millions people overseas fake vaccine.

If question ""who lied Covid"" USA wins one hands resulting numbers clear evidence. SF rush hour traffic (dinnertime), like 1.5-2 hours, point still stands. Good stuff nothing useful lifetimes then. Wonder state world 200 years though... Definitely lot measures. We’ve shut indoor dining believe, least Chicago. still outdoor dining lots restaurants setting tents making effectively indoors ventilation.

We’re definitely quite locked spring definitely average compared states I’d say Strategic use maybe. Yes, many cases, EMTs firefighters one same, double duty. vast majority runs medical vs fire (and emergencies). Yep two months bed nation wide.

We 1,000,000 beds entire hospital system nation wide. rate new cases precent needing hostile survive good trajectory. Happy resorts like Winter Park offers uphill skiing. great way stay socially isolated. still can’t believe Brexit deal? Could point direction source please? Dumbass take. got covid March lungs still fucked. 20 cases really low like one 9-11 attack every day. humanity selfish awful. Cancer patients can't really full lockdown. Babies parents probably need go work, like immune compromised people. plan current administration distribute vaccines, going go state essentially develop plan? already states receive vaccine others? I'm clinically extremely vulnerable, always nice thing hear yourself. idea queue am, long listen hold music mind waiting bit. ok, read it...

Effictiveness:  
-94-95% = Pfizer / Moderna 
-66% = Oxford 

Price: 
$3 = Oxford 
$15 = Moderna 
$25 = Pfizer 



Storage: 
2-8 degrees: Oxford 
-20 degrees 1 month 2-8: Moderna 
-60 degrees: Pfizer 


Oxford's efficiency good compared moderna/pfizer. first dose type thing, OK. need many doses around world type. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Oxford gives great storage (which means easy delivery) great price cost efficient (66%).**

&amp;nbsp;

**Moderna gives low-ish price alongside reachable temperatures greatly efficiency (94%). 

&amp;nbsp;

**Pfizer difficult transport distribute. enough -80 fridges. Plus dry ice route helps 15 days. difficult. Plus expensive (by lot). best efficiency much. Price plus storage nearly Moderna vaccine make Pfizer vaccine less desirable overall.** probably perfect training-wheels virus.

If something deadlier, like relative MERS (34.5% case fatality rate), and/or longer incubation period, like ebola (but contagious symptoms appear, like SARS-COV-2), would end billions dead.

To me, responses pandemic around world disappointing. hopefully got permanent boost work-from-home, mask wearing, vaccine tech, etc. hopefully people government realize bad things become, prepared worse one.

I've worried huge pandemic since 2012-ish, primed respond January. Got first car expect government people anything (see 1968 flu pandemic) bunch masks, started stockpiling enough food two people last three-ish months.

Next time around, I'm hoping world governments reply much quickly. least know eradication actually option now, we'd need work together. That's many people sub believe hence downvotes. cares Indian African girl gets trafficked beaten, least COVID! cares little Timmy regressed grades tanking, dumb, COVID free. know live, USA minor lockdowns mainly restricted crowded indoor establishments. Nothing stopping going outdoors visiting family/friends within COVID free bubble. spent lot time parks walking beaches outdoor picnics, heck even took kids zoo. Short able eat restaurants, really many restrictions. guy town went stores right got hospital covid bored.  told stay home. I'm sure happens lot. Man I'm desperately waiting Oxford AZ news mean...I see ways. matter feel someone incarcerated, gathered closely day long. anyone gets it, going spread like wildfire means easily spread simply work visit incarcerated. say inmates 'prioritized' someone else, think reality need look highest risk citizens determine order vaccinate them. Put politics feelings aside, simply game numbers reducing transmission quickly possible. LOL want give murders rapists vaccine doctors elderly. joke. also get access much health care need, state picks tab anything serious. covering COVID PTs top priority. nursing director said local leaders expect vaccines available general public early spring. told friend skeptical bc rushed 

“It’s rushed man, it’s meet thresholds vaccines. Think vaccine Disney vaccines covid vaccine pass allows skip lines” department runs EMS included along EMS responders.

If fire fire/rescue absolutely reason get first. catch Covid fire Thank goodness society weigh balance things. Kids die exceptionally low rates, damage caused keeping kids home immense. kids die forced stay home would killed virus open schools. People reactionary ignoring facts isn’t helpful. Surprise, Fauci knows do. Supplies limited act now! don’t see xenophobia. see pretty similar. coming someone Mexican descent.

A lot studies mention immigrants likely commit crime Americans, understand. However, studies compare likelihood commit crimes, find little misleading. avoid fact 10 million people come commit crime less rate Americans, still net increase number crimes.


What (hypothetically) discovered Americans going Canada affect infection rate? overall population stayed 1% infected? scenario, however increase raw number people virus. balances Americans come infected same/lower rates. Would still okay restriction?


I would like stronger border controls also program doesn’t put people cages one allows people clean histories come find work/provide families back home. would akin Canada allowing passes series Covid tests country. know real crisis matters still raking money.

This much. they've decades rubberstambing lobbyist policy actually actually jobs idea. keep saying every week surpasses next. 

Nation wide beds two months. Fairfield County CT I've gotten single notification App. That's either really good I'm one installed. don’t know vaccines prevent long term effects Covid, don’t know protective vaccines virtue trial designs we’ve imposed. full dataset produced may yet exist. say right first interim results suggest vaccines may prevent symptomatic presentations Covid. haven’t seen enough responses make strong statement effectiveness despite what’s reported. rollout real phase III. fact politicians making bad decisions somehow make decisions good. That's works. That’s worrying. Doesn’t Illinois basically every realistic measure place? set NEW record today cross 100,000 COVID hospitalizations shitstorm beginning FDA fired en masse banned public service delaying approval. Name shame assholes killing Americans. Recommend double masking. KN95 N95 + cloth mask top. doctors I’ve seen year doubling. Boris hammers away idea UK able approve quickly subject EU’s requirements, public perception Brexit might completely flip  mean it’s available general public said spring.

There actually evidence one shot lot confer benefits. full dose two. Again, doesn’t change mindset. get vaccine without bunch red tape, done caring. Yep. It’s opened eyes pathetically selfish people country. replied someone like “I’m low risk doesn’t matter do, I’ve living life normally”. Like no, that’s okay, that’s are. That’s gets spread, even don’t symptoms high risk, people come contact might one thing need help understanding...can't nation produce vaccine copying formula phizer moderna approved? Phizer approved UK, country copy formula distribute it. Strong Hospital. Expecting first shipment Dec 14th. patient care COVID pts first priority. really work human society technology. Even mask requirements businesses aren’t really enforced within business anyway. it’s fair expect teenager/college kid working floor get verbally even potentially physically assaulted either get end it. “mandate” purely show Gov say tried could try.

Really easily replaced. Americans still trying spread Covid rest world lul “The skiers said ready sit season cited fears others might follow safety guidelines outlined resorts — like social distancing mandatory masks — well frustration [reservation concerns costs declining economy.  
A large number skiers thought skiing would shut due pandemic point season, 36% respondents giving shutdown 50-50 chance; 29% guessing 75% chance resorts would close; 18% saying resorts would certainly close. 

“That really show lot optimistic people there, majority community looking ready assuming shut point,” said David Flaherty, co-founder chief executive Magellan Strategies. 

But majority respondents — particularly skiers 25 — expressed trust resorts would provide quality turns even new rules limit spread COVID-19. 69% said confident rules installed limit COVID-19 would protect visitors employees.

When asked kind rules would help feel protected COVID-19, skiers suggested protocols resorts already planned season: limiting capacities, requiring masks, distancing skiers lines, cleaning restricting indoor activities access.

Magellan’s study — included questions suggested Colorado Sun — detailed hundreds verbatim responses explored beyond statistics. comments skiers might avoid riding lifts season telling, ski-town locals Front Rangers worrying flood travelers afar spread virus resort shuttles, restaurants lodges.  

“I go year without skiing downhill,” said Park County woman “strongly” considering skiing season. 

“Because travel stupid frivolous,” said Pitkin County man.“ Ahaha bro
I’m terrible don’t trust government? best, we're going see permanent work home programs, think.

I highly doubt we're going see much movement Western governments. People going want pretend never happened, lessons lost most.

Here USA lot pandemic planning place. fully ignored *and continues 260k deaths.* enough ignorant, selfish, greedy, lazy voters politicians see major changes enacted. Senate barely get anything passed thanks one obstructionist party wants install judges.

We fully knew pandemic going like, early on. wonderful example Spanish Flu. Yet still tens millions people claiming hoax refusing take precautions! f*** supposed deal that? post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* wonder going grocery store counts “event”. There’s definitely ten people shopping. many excess deaths earlier days total chaos. think data bit reliable except places like Florida doctor results. likely around 400k excess deaths now, CDC internationally makes tough easily view data without quite bit manual manipulation. 

Add 100k infected eventually die, see case saying 500k dead dying United States. late January, number 600-700k range. Absolutely atrocious since time imperiled finally start get vaccinated. Yes. point don’t data long term consequences. Quoting death statistics like aspect virus matters misleading. imagine sitting days. wonder hand sanitiser regulations cleaners, make unattractive children drink. Many victims cited article mental health issues (including alcoholism). Discriminating based job choice. real progressive right here. Every state needs make attacks people enforcing public health measures aggravator sentencing. I’m bs hypocritical “leaders” Ok so.  agreeing people can’t vaccinated would agree individuals need full lockdown ? best thing have. UR Strong. talked nursing director said first shipment arriving 14th. local leaders expects available general public early spring. Aw yeah! legit cut Onion News Network bit YouTube legitimately feared jokes would taken real want contribute Era misinformation. expect society applaud that

I cater it.

I live life please, thank you. need society seem imply accept risk give social distancing, everything risky.

Yeah, never said ""too hard"". long going cower houses virus mild symptoms people really matter American, flawed perspective flawed perspective.

Not everyone sees way Americans do. consider perspective _isn't_ flawed? Yep. I've saying frequently. even year. whole thing started March USA, December... (counting fingers)... that's like 9 months.

I understand people suffering financially, whining wear masks able bars nightclubs concert halls. however thing bureaucracy holding back approvals, EU notorious bureaucracy. MHRA stringent fact EU regulator can't specify exactly 'more thorough' process they've conducting rolling reviews telling. Pfizer sent data time, anything questioning MHRA's process. purpose? enough data say Oxford vaccine prevents severity cases? comment replied implying boarder always remain closed/limited entry Americans “different values”. 

Not specific COVID. Give re-read. America gets judged differently immigration policy. Meh 1918 flu ended via herd immunity 20s great time live in. would've dark all. ""Just wait two weeks dead"" LOL

I kind think beyond terrible idea. Doctor reckon even mask face shield would risk since would breathing mouth open. Panting perhaps even. 

And important risk pandemic ends ditch masks years. would trained mouth breathers. May well grow mullet compliment new mouth breather status. hope works Russia Nobody Canada declare bankruptcy unexpected healthcare expenses. Meanwhile, that's one leading causes bankruptcy US.

Also, per capita covid death rate Canada much lower US. yeah, Canada's healthcare system works better people health emergencies, cheaper US healthcare system, saves lives unforeseen events like covid pandemic.

And yes, Latinx preferred nomenclature. want go fucking baseball game badly hurts. They're somewhat different things, equating flu covid19 entirely accurate. Covid particularly nasty easy spread showing symptoms mild symptoms, flu isint particularly spreadable becomes obvious sick. Wearing mask prevents catching things others, non medical grade mask particular wearing mask prevents spread others

 covid there's good way knowing test still hideously inaccurate best way prevent spread everyone operate assumption may wear mask prevent spread others. 

The test flu fairly accurate find stay home. However, unrealistic think everyone stay home entire year prevent covid19 spread, hence mask everyone. 

And number flu deaths per year problematic, I've spent years explaining numbers people, mostly people realize many folks kills year. dont people take flu seriously? Pure ignorance mostly. Saying people fine flu death fine covid death absurd, simply people know flu deaths know issue concerned about. That's said ""if"", course speculation believe case.

In opinion two different organizations two different approaches vaccine approval, one takes longer other. impossible distinct plans action show results day.

In process, 3 weeks difference nothing. Imagine thinking Californians would want move shithole like Tennessee. think so.

Europe mad cow. think malaria risk travel excludes you. learn give authority sacrifice happiness utility told to, that's great. Better unlearn lesson.

No, told to, greater good. People need learn sometimes go little unpleasantness personally society grow.

For instance, Japan never official lockdown (as legal so), always great mask compliance. Due this, Japan roughly 1200 cases per 1 million people US 42k cases per 1 million people.

If people would compliant masks social distancing, could drastically reduce transmission rate. People selfish though.  Teachers, faculty, families go get vaccinated. saw United Airlines ad today YouTube said 99.999% safe (or comforting stat like that), confirmed DoD test. cabins HEPA filtered air routinely exchanged outside air. 

So... science saying safer expected? Narrator: Couldn’t agree more. Worth paying licence fee sure virus equally comply shorter timeframe. can't wait church (which practiced social distancing) filled. never realized much needed pandemic began. I'll probably keep mask least month fact. heard hospital system collapsing 3 weeks

Hospital admissions already increasing exponentially Thanksgiving, millions Americans travelled around country without even minimal quarantine precautions.

Yesterday 180,000 new cases. Today likely more. Two weeks now, lot more.

So think going lol

Why appropriate sentiment dealing grave matters? agree. teams need strict organization quarantine NFL postseason real shitshow. bothers well. Hopefully they’ll answers soon. sounds suspiciously remote controlled Soros minion programmed usher New World Order would say do. :O I’m talking full dataset doesn’t exist yet no, you’re incorrect misunderstand what’s represented Pfizer never even answered one question power answer (which important three questions asked). want able meet *any* people besides wife. friends live different country - far used simple go there, somebody drawn line one decades rules cross change time. want able visit doctor need medicine keeps walking shipped air cargo $400. want get back travelling world still can, available time likely limited me.

Fauci drastically changed tune sings past week. vaccines must goood Yesterday black Monday USA, one worst Covid-19 days. today, Worldometers even close real figure, nightmare. ~9 hours go, already registering deaths. cautious, safe.

Where going? ok that. ok healthcare costing arm leg literally. Today supposed high numbers/catch day. following data, drop started week ago - likely holiday. Covid Tracking Project predicted trend/a big day Wednesday. That's said minimize situation (our numbers US good, either way), bring context. ""Communism classist form socialism"" 


Wow treasure trove bad takes huh short amount time. Even $600, anybody UI long time year got little money. Right. whole thing little proportion. end, individuals choice. school days need it, ultimate parents children need decide. \*current Idk rest, I'd happily vaccine :)  also, heart disease, diabetes, cancer etc, spreadable, contagious crazy. Thinking breathed everyone’s air around us like nothing! Still wearing masks many years even vaccine Easy Tennessee native. toast, I’m glad I’m deferring Christmas. What’s truly got worried though foreign actors taking notes inevitably release *actual labgrown disease... Americans looked absolutely fucking foolish entire year fussed like children haircuts mask wearing. parents flying cross country ski MLK weekend jesus christ saying come here, horrible. State governments barely budgets give support without federal assistance. likely best do. 

This absolute disaster Senate gridlocked appropriating emergency funds half year point. open-minded, check 60 Minutes episode German prison. may change mind what's best society comes treat criminals, even can't wait bring baby places! Baby earth side yet, arrive later weekend via induction. entire pregnancy pandemic I'm sure fourth trimester mostly similar first three, there's hope us yet! stimulus money ended July. 

and get UI still working making less would make UI. UI already fraction would make working full time. means regular folks able get sooner. Except governors, politicians, President. Keep mind efficacy vaccines acceptably reduced merely lesser systems rather 100% prevention. is, least US vaccine threshold, reduce symptoms prevent someone contracting disease all.

We also know asymptomatic people vulnerable long-term and/or permanent effects.

Putting two together means vaccine necessarily protect potential issues--it's intended keep alive that's threshold that's approved.  full covid help say ""work home from"" head Yoda voice talk states conducting review vaccines. process work? Pfizer Moderna apply state? FDA release application states? thought confidential review process.

Basically, could serious review access application data? Cope, d00mer. Plenty politicians ignored precautions restrictions 

""Their own""? ""precautions restrictions"" Trump imposed? Indeed, believe ever another coronavirus pandemic much better response it. Unfortunately yes, US learning experience rather history.  Note disclaimers end contradicting ""facts"" piece. Pathetic even got green light get published. feel weird while, think last long. group friends isolated 2 weeks could take camping trip together without masks/distancing. felt awkward first, second day felt like old times hard go back reality. hope little things helped, like put gaming rig garage running folding@home since March GPU, overly anal making sure iPads iPhones running DreamLab use. 

I like think anyway thing already system distribution verification unemployment. quickest, easiest way get stimulus people need (and importantly state, people would otherwise drastically cut back spending goods services). Seriously consider driving highway speeds next couple months hate I'm even Australian. living people, right? take bribe vaccine please! bad.

Up past week, knew *of* people getting COVID -- Facebook acquaintances, someone went school never met, people's parents, etc. -- one considered real friend it. Since Thanksgiving, several friends tested positive quite sick (none danger -- hopefully). Cases high unsustainable levels, even corners country (I'm WA state) people mostly reasonable numbers spiking. Elsewhere... mean, places where, statistically, every family five least one positive case.

And surrounded deniers. neighbors canceled Costco memberships solely enforce mask mandate. Churches keep holding -- secretly openly -- large events services. Gyms pretend they're healthcare facilities open governor ordered closed.

This whole thing basically terrifying get better fast. appllause due school decision, want anyone else move in? feel you. managed score tickets one Chemical Romance reunion shows Newark, NJ, hometown. Luckily they’ve thus far postponed I’m holding hope we’ll good vaccinated September, man one sting. favorite band growing up, first concert myself, pumped hell touring again.

That's pretty good result. born raised Tennessean, good you. don’t suggest moving American South general. I’m giving Tennessee peace May. Medical school nursing school take years. increase funding helpful years line. I'm saying banking strong healthcare system ignoring simple public health initiatives foolish unviable current state.

*looks USA* president united states donald trump works public officials personally doubts make good estimates.... don’t live Astoria. Goonies Beach Astoria. likely taking route would take. someone lives Portland doesn’t commute route regularly supplies medical treatments don’t know it’s actually like. locals actually call “Danger Mountain” local forum discuss it’s safe cross not. lived Portland 13 years idea Coast locals actually deal comes weather crossing Portland. 
You realize time wasn’t anywhere use restroom family 4 gastrointestinal pain illness. One gets car sick even trying go highway 53 go around longer journey hit 26 6. 
It would really fucking stupid drive Portland get tested (although June fact try get tested hillsboro denied) local doctor tells us get back bed rest. Dude there’s nothing said get realize idiot are. I’m going leave there. You’re ignorant fuck. You’re moron. don’t see comparison trump all, whatever. outraged woman whoever else want, don’t really care. try stay safe! We’ve got Oxford one around corner huge amount people get, likely brings us herd immunity. used help third world countries since it’s cheaper easier store. It’s development since January. There’s international cooperation, fact US one refusing cooperate dragging feet, mostly thanks Trump.

So nah, really. I'm sure weird TV contract issues but, me, bubble major city high quality college fields play couple game every day week. would weird season sure could cut canceled games.

MLB worked travel sport naturally socially distanced playing even fully avoid COVID like NBA NHL also bubbled. fuck people kicker is, peer reviewed studies indicating masks effective reducing spread respiratory viruses **before** pandemic even started. burden proof there.

For example:

van der Sande, M., Teunis, P., &amp; Sabel, R. (2008). Professional home-made face masks reduce exposure respiratory infections among general population. *PloS one, 3(7), mostly said Cuomo case Trump somehow managed ""push through"" vaccine without regular FDA approval. point, would surprised NY delayed anything past FDA needs do. Trump Cuomo basically dick measuring contest since pandemic started. Imagine giving vaccine criminals elderly immunocompromised. Shame Colorado. guess tell grandfather go rob bank something get vaccinated already much higher risk prisoners website virus players really missed getting pelted batteries. it’ll mean nothing unempathetic assholes made bad first place I'm betting it'll like 2022. It'll take time everyone gets vaccinated enough normal there's always conspiracy theorists hamper prevention efforts. Going ventilator much better proposition now, successful treatment (dexamethasone aka dex, steroid used primarily treating altitude sickness) gets applied time. even survive ventilator induced coma weeks months, ain't great outcome.

Meanwhile skimped lot things could help.  fly, get cruise ship ""go style""... 

&amp;#x200B;

(pun much intended) would take four weeks read understand couple pages text, EU?

With multiple thousands people dying day, ever need move faster, now.

Or, bureaucratic claws sunk deep, sucking much blood, body cannot move? yeah door restaurants there...but misread statement. pay amount cover necessities incarcerated individuals you.  say I.

You fail comprehend prisons jails also full law abiding citizens child rapists murders. using excessive exaggeration can't address reality.

Also, incarcerated mean law abiding. look rates teen pregnancies result adult man, use recreational drugs, dwi, more.

I value everyone unlike you. also know they'll getting top shelf health care little expense. Thanks explanation, understand want kill got little mad something wrote Reddit. Completely reasonable. Correct, believe first dose still effective, lower rate complete second injection later. Post-covid prognosis, like disease ailment, depend individual. best thing check develops post-covid symptoms.

Here's finally able overcome it. social distancing permanent

But why? would local governments want permanent mask mandates? Went July 2020 January 2021 postponing till May 2021 :( isn't. like someone holds gun head demands money. choice hand wallet consequence death severe injury.

In time may data certain age groups react better vaccine, thus might need one shot. too. seen year. No, ""long covid"" refers people extended symptoms disease. Different groups started different terms there's disagreement standardizing exactly defines [long haulers | long covid | extended tail phase | etc]. *think* ""Long haulers"" originated US patients Facebook groups trying deal symptoms getting lot initial support medical community; first time heard ""long vovid"", similar groups UK patients; ""the tail phase"" scientists researchers trying label as. nice day stay safe. best luck. goodbye.

Comparing COVID flu gives people false sense security. Flu season/illnesses might go dramatically year, due precautions people taking prevent spread COVID. Australia's flu season much less severe year, somewhat expect same. I'm personally hoping flu season less severe, otherwise hospitals even overwhelmed serious flu cases rise along exponential COVID spread. feeling og fatigue / shortness breath obvious symptom lowered oxygen level?

It would cases is. weird thing though -- someone mentioned referring ""happy hypoxia"" -- Covid patients, people hypoxia point would normally make unconscious show absolutely symptoms. Maybe pulse oximeters measure O2 saturation extremities Covid causes blockages smaller blood vessels cut oxygen extremities particular (while maybe greater supply making brain time)? I'm really sure say you. People shut close year can't least understand many letting guard fool quite frankly.

Also tell me, part problem? certainly know single thing live life. busy regurgitating echo chamber talking points neglected respond single point making lockdowns, government overreach dangerous precedent set.  something like 41% people say get vaccine?

The ACA covers *health insurance* underwriting exclusively. Life insurance adjustors **never** operate parameters. deny coverage reason, time. review file periodically reassess risk, thus raising annual premiums, **unilaterally**.

Got vents production rolled Bush “mission accomplished” banner. backlog spread across week. mean jan 1 2022. newyears month going clusterfuck. I'm glad I'm US  got 322 bucks today! Maybe best accept california kinda shithole, no? laws work here? Endangerment? hard time seeing charges hold court unless harm definitively established.  believe “immunize” implies doses Yes? And?

The story says SF Napa counties allowed indoor outdoor dining time.

Breed's never said people restrictive guidelines. would quite something 200 million doses administered February words roughly 1% population per day get shot. (Keep mind means .5% population immunized per day takes two shots.) 
 
But yes, seeing believing, way pandemic handled give much hope number reached. pass damn aid package already States shut without effected workers zero income direction. People living lives given choice now, everyone expected go work things too? work dangerous going friends family, especially us service industry. We're supposed serve dine guests 8+ hours day lock home alone clock out? That's legitimate wage slave stuff. locked either working environments one without mask anywhere near us paid stay home vaccinated. pay military pay this. Rrrrreeeeeeeeee! want remain hiding forever! /s 7 million people California living poverty, 9% poverty, biggest homeless population country. good think California's economy actually is? Bought house recently? How's biggest divide rich poor state?

Yes, fire federal land, led $10 billion lost due joke Germany medical corporations develop this? May 2021 well! Lets stay positive hope best! Sounds on-par amount empathy shown lot Americans.

Wearing mask one smallest acts help protect others, yet people resist? still super selfish decision part. People run trouble camping time require EMS support. hospitals overrun. got accident way there? major reason people telling stay home risk overloading already taxed medical systems.

Big Bend going anywhere. could waited next year vaccine out.

Your decision pure selfishness. Sad thing another pandemic similar sometime next ten years (please no, theoretical only), we'd again. sad. sad. Speak yourself. love everything state don’t plan leaving California ever honestly. Direct anger elsewhere :) Punchable face alert start fined full costs 14 day quarantine health care everyone flight, including lost salary. 

Seems like matter hard throw book people learn. Yeah, 102 years scientific medical breakthroughs side keeping people alive would ever chance covid hit 1918 instead. first question^1 but, sake argument, let's assume accurate jump next question...

Is even mathematically possible jab many arms time period?

To 100 million immunized 2/28, need get first dose 1/31. Yes, I'm playing little loose numbers since one needs 3 weeks between. make that, let's assume we'll able vaccinate soon 12/14. That's 7 weeks first doses make estimate. 

100 ÷ 7 weeks ÷ 7 days = 2.04 million people injected per day (which ramps 4 million per day week 3)

I know articles said we're shit comprehending large numbers seems like really big per-day number hit.

This one times life hope someone comes along tells screwed math.

1 - NGL, first thought mixed doses people, 50 million people immunized 100 million doses story bit different pastors. Services held outdoors. encouraged use masks. followed rules.

It's entirely possible caught Walmart visiting family. Yes. get DNA altering vaccine end definitely near ☹️ Mid-March None matters hundreds thousands dead wage growth huge amount population, plus massive unemployment dysfunctional government. pre-covid too, really brought things head.

Look Parler taking - cesspool may be.

I'm kidding sleeping better. I've insomnia many years. month leaving FB information noise behind, started sleeping better ages. honestly think Facebook toxic lot longer recent years. Letting much noise head (good bad) affecting negatively ways know disconnected it. get people overstate risk children. 116 children died flu 2019. 100 children teenagers died Covid 19 2020. 100. child likely die flu year ago dying covid 19.

More children died car crashes covid 19. Covid dangerous disease, risk pose children miniscule.

The reasons schools need closed spread disease vulnerable people.

This misinformation, plain fact. believe children significant risk dying covid, also consider causes death FAR likely kill child. 700 kids die year drowning. hope Pfizer said least one year. Based cell studies, likely several years, though people immunity issues may need frequent boosters. goes natural immunity. megatron tho? country But... but... already first wave, called clinical trials!

For me, sign up. second get one, get it. wanna first line. travel bans going stay place countries long time yet clear, thinks MetLife stadium filled Jets games? angry, except you, apparently?

All I'm saying *fact* literally been. second delivery late? Currently ACA, yes. However ACA overturned health insurance companies go back covering pre-existing conditions, like COVID, before. said thing basically got downmodded like 150 times. :-) measure right are. Original thought nuance appreciated pandemic time.

In three years see safe was. indeed speedy process mean thing overlooked rush race.

Even find issues, probably ethically acceptable risks go considering outbreak.

The world complex simple statements assure skeptics. skeptic. technorealist. great reset look it, world change massive ways 'killer virus' 99% survival rate front It’s proof lying 

Maybe COVID news controlled Govt don’t hide anymore Nope, same. One public health hazard declares themself law, one doesn’t. Show study shows correlation Vitamin Covid deaths. Pretty simple request. Yes. 

“There decades nothing happens, weeks decades happen.” Certainly must demand transparency peer-reviewed vaccine data 

That going happen declared companies. happened far phases (I'm really confused people think peer-reviewed data come happened previous instances this). Plus, FDA meetings coming broadcast everyone see review data sent peer-review Oklahoma still mask mandate? That's freaking nuts. aligned thoughts prayers mass shootings. thousand percent true. instead prisoners mental institution, would backlash? Probably not, maybe would passive 'yeah sure ok we'll get them.' think people really understand prioritizing certain groups others. cool want get certain people vaccinated protect them. too! want wife's immuno-compromised parents safe! that's goal. goal suppress transmission, get things control stop spread along measures we're already taking. Eventually, sure, let's broaden scope. speed head also thinks normal May.

While say exact words, following scripture implies geocentrism root argument copernicus:

1 Chronicles 16:30, Psalm 93:1, Psalm 96:10, Psalm 104:5, Ecclesiastes 1:5 feels like whole decade point tbh. even read goddamn article Chinese government steadfastly rejected accusations made United States Western governments deliberately concealed information relating virus, maintaining upfront since beginning outbreak. However, though **the documents provide evidence deliberate attempt obfuscate findings**, reveal numerous inconsistencies authorities believed happening revealed coronavirus diagnosis, published China's National Health Commission late January, told doctors label case ""suspected"" patient contact history known cases, fever pneumonia symptoms, elevate case ""clinically diagnosed"" symptoms confirmed X-ray CT scan. case would ""confirmed"" polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genetic sequencing tests came back officials soon improve reporting system, placing ""clinically diagnosed"" cases ""confirmed"" category mid-February.

Where even get November 2019 from. named make fun CHAZ conversation wife yesterday. makes look stupid say get test. hard get test lot places. government hands money select number people struggling, someone responds ""well give money everyone instead people?"" person choosing beggar. 

It nothing taxes, fact they're choosey free gift money. Proper testing lasts long lack resources. People must understand side effects magically show ten years getting vaccine. Finally, shorter timeframe balanced much bigger sample people phase 3 usual. posted mom virus fall 2019 better Jan 2020 hearing fucked she’s faced hearing aids don’t hear unless someone screams.

Hopefully people want vaccine take feel safe. Let us anti-covid vaxxers kill lol. kind seems like dis-incentive get tested don’t symptoms, mildly sick, no?

If want life insurance you’re older, maybe don’t want Covid diagnosis medical history don’t to. difference stupidity ignorance sub loves using ignorant. 

Ignorance knowing something. Stupidity refusing learn something actively causing harm others. governor doesn’t follow rules anyways would know. LA major city never allowed indoor dining gyms since March Ok mom virus sept 2019 December 2019, coughing clogged ears congestion. went dr times since went long kept saying virus take decongestant.

Well better Jan 2020 since she’s worse worse hearing loss seen audiologists etc faced getting hearing aids going life saying nonstop blare tv.
Also gets dizzy.
She’s like wtf virus need hearing aids?!
Never heard I’m reading timeframe.
I hope things get better you! Luckily full time whf hear makes cringe every time That's...not downside. idea need massive suffering world change humanity something better dangerous destructive one. need balance collective thinking rugged individualism. family isn’t death month er grandfather. One coworkers this. 100% told stay home went place without mask. shits given. posted pics place. People give one shit govt isn’t anything it. mean, 50/50, it?

50% staying inside avoiding rain, 50% middle aged men walking around shirt carlsberg hand. kind absolute nonsense this? Hmm, yes, take vaccine global pandemic, wear mask, listening scientists actually know talking clearly take everything told face value. people listen fringe conspiracies less likely brainwashed? stupid comment upvotes? Russian bots trying stop Americans getting vaccine? LA County year. also need factor reality many people go church versus number people go schools... big difference number likely people infected. suspect add number people potentially exposed times amount time church case kids college students time school times total would see insanely larger exposure risk schools. 

And factor administrators teachers older likely suffer virus create even bigger problem. large chunk people go church regular basis older often retired, economy suffers less die teachers administrators die need replaced. 

Frankly can't see logic shutting one leaving open. closed trying stop spread. exposed someone fever. confirmed covid test him. exposed Friday, tested Monday, got negative test today. trust test? get soon? destroyed economy process. lose spending weak. Won’t make research vaccines, furlough, track trace ect. I've consistently said masks never go away. I'm convinced businesses require end 2021 minimum. Mask mandate government end summer 2021 minimum. There's really nothing enforced. counties strict attempting enact enforce safety measures, aren't. Many counties enforcing anything. voluntary individuals private businesses. I'm dying laughter (not) Low risk person stationed there? Depends setup. even useful check temperatures, since people mask fever Tylenol, least 15% symptomatic cases even include fever. Coming guy said Masks bad March 

He’s obviously wicked smart top expert, speak gospel I’m &amp; governor doesn’t care all. went bedlam football game last weekend, stadium packed. think bringing SARS pandemic actually proof learn mistakes. average American treated meme instead potentially deadly virus seemed like foreign threat. ebola even though parts world struck hard. see similarities COVID like Dakotas medical workers saying patients still claiming hoax pass away hospital. 



The world changed since form unchecked, unfettered propaganda. Facebook algorithms biased back then. Unless figure way stop spread harmful propaganda growing anti Vax movement new COVID vaccines, much worse place decade ago, that's even factoring politicization science health, growing economic inequalities social issues. pray learn mistakes, seems like uphill climb versus smooth downward slope.

Wait thought always listen experts?  guess right January 20, 2021 they'll Fauci Birx attempting speak sense nonsensical Emperor. hopefully mean proper summer... British standards means still staying indoors avoid rain... study HKU team back March, showing BZK (benzalkonium chloride) cleaner works good.

Arrogance costly, wait US based researcher publish something, always half year behind pandemic. Mid-December, late December 74 million good guesstimate Yup.

And *anything*, would expect vaccine group actually behave slightly *worse* “the new normal” particularly hard confirm got vaccine, either feeling shot, getting antibody testing.

So number vaccine groupers know vaccine may inclined engage riskier behavior. Beyond placebo groupers same. We’ve ordered 40 million doses (which primarily funded Germany America), 100m doses Oxford University vaccine.

How America saving anything. talking about? birx came explicitly said strongly disagrees views. coming Trump make extreme. cannot find source claims anyone task force besides atlas point time called herd immunity. fuck pharmaceutical industry. heroes, destroying america.

False positives extremely rare since PCR tests look exact SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequence. going happen.

We're constantly interacting COVID-positive people time. Sometimes without even knowing. always believed body extremely complex, everything interconnected, majority cases, one apparently deficient calcium cannot solve deficiency taking calcium supplements, it’s much complex that.
No exception vitamin D. 
I believe term vitamin D, getting sunlight exposure better taking supplement (although sun screen needed long period sun exposure). 
And eating natural unprocessed foods good too.
Foraging wild plants, eating fermented foods like kimchi, kefir, yogurt, sour cream, fermented meat (make yourself), eat foods forage wild grow house “clean” eat somewhat raw foods sometimes may help gut health too. There's distinct difference - one comes abundance caution, comes throwing caution wind.

The data school safety yet conclusive. sensible, pandemic, proceed caution data conclusive. believe chloroquine highly effective COVID treatment US would 60,000 COVID deaths? so, learned lesson buying premature science. not, already participated sort scepticism.


The data *suggests* schools super spreaders. That's great hope proves true long run, mean schools totally safe. That's data also shows kids fact spread safe open schools uncontrolled community spread, describes America right now.

The AAP said beginning, somehow advocates in-person school always seem ignore part hear ""open schools."" brought Russia, Putin. two things become synonymous mindless CNN brainwashed war mongers like typical US citizen yourself, started licking boots, sort like Putin supporter would do...

Look hurt am! Lol. ever saw $19 Bud light Barclays Center. Obviously get it. ... knew risky told mom invite him, made choice sit next him?

That's kinda fault. say take proper precautions sat next guy works bar. That's taking proper precautions. Yes medicines side effects. years spent study it. volunteer complained severe side effect. tests extended? even larger group selected probability possible underlying conditions caused studied?

We could advice individuals may develop side effects wait. similar certain medicines prescribed certain individuals conflicting conditions. mention even deserve first shipments (besides healthcare workers. some.)

Oh God's sake, cut crap out. entire country needs punished idiots? No. get play nonsense game ""this country suffer get vaccine acted pandemic"". Get woth that. 99% there. guarantees, clearly getting closer; sides want it, there's pressure ever get line outcome.

It’s rough cancer basically death sentence. He’s fighting year half knows much longer has. Everyone else seemed ok visit express concerns even testing need isolate 7 days. felt like party pooper.  Hopefully vaccine available soon travel iffy me.  live alone isolate 14 days pretty easily live minutes away.  feel like I’m right thing feel guilty.  health take turn worst don’t want one didn’t let see one last time.  Fuck virus fuck can’t. CA, UIB max $450/wk paid biweekly. PUC $600 biweekly added that, totaled $450 +$450 +$600 = $1500 every 2 weeks. That's $3250.50/mo untaxed average months get 3 checks instead 2.
 
While incredibly grateful still job, numbers daydreaming days laid off. orange 🍊 face though 😂 breadwinner family dies life insurance, health insurance might least worries family left behind. Lives get destroyed way. Life insurance important. originally said wipes like ""wet ones"" kill viruses like coronavirus. oh please, can't say ""inductive reasoning"" brand new tech that's never tested declare kind certainty saying works certain way. 

go ahead try publish scientific paper without data something novel say ""I've proved inductive reasoning."" Uh huh yep. totally help something. gunna test em?

Test Monday/Tuesday early get results past weekend. 

Test Wed/Thurs/Fri, they're already spreading virus following Monday/Tuesday partying weekend. 

Its lose lose pointless move. it’s fair expect teenager/college kid working floor get verbally even potentially physically assaulted either get end it.

Yep. They're asking minimum wage workers confront unpatriotic traitors, filled rage anger conservative media, often firearm person car, wear mask... knowing believe wearing mask sort assault perceived rights. Even many fucking jabronis fit hyperbolic description, they're still going spray saliva face tell feel this. Literal Nobel prize deserving people. Chemestry Peace. committee recommended if/when vaccine receives EUA medical workers long term care residents given first priority. first EUA hearing scheduled later month. problem people think either die 100% recover it, know that's true. got super sick pneumonia last year kicked ass. pretty high level fitness took months fully recover. base recommendations best available evidence time. Science constantly evolving. need flexible. Oh beginning end im afraid actually fire engine paramedic still getting dispatched 911 call. thing different paramedic-staffed ambulance dispatched alongside them.  Civil service separate government, civil service actually quite competent mitigated lot damage government caused last ~5 years. What’s political scientists knowing they’re talking about? Also, I’m trying put down- often think girl bowl get funk. It’s tragic story reminds easy it, even things seem hard. Good luck man, Merry Christmas! good bad days. days good, ambient noise, watching tv drowns out. days blast tv still loud head. That's NYC number. 19,608 confirmed Covid-19 deaths 4,694 probable Covid-19 it’s worth effort wear mask? It’s killing idea many times got downvoted hell asking something skeptical

Im far anti vaxx, people cant comprehend that. I'm small business owner, sympathize every business impacted COVID. I'm 75% last year. said, fuck keeping pandemic going longer needs to. followed minimum asked us early on, might like Australia right now, enjoying near-normal return life. don’t know. agreed. 

Where disagree say make logical, educated prediction. won’t believe stove hot touch fake drama around sports especially college football fucking ridiculous. took 20 years team sucking realize this. would seem solution avoid tested, would create many problems. 

A lot people who've covid likely opt vaccines reason. life insurance company runs blood test finds covid19 antibodies cells, vaccine perfect cover. able know infected simply got vaccinated. still doesn’t mean don’t give vaccine make biggest impact. thanks cool numbers. People power. Hell yeah ADE really concern getting vaccine disease, concern getting disease disease vaccinated.

The subjects also drawn general population people known history SARS-CoV-2 infection excluded. screen antibodies (as exclusionary criteria, assess neutralizing antibody activity after). certainly enrolled people infected (into arms) know it. ..with bodies? guys US decided wait til Dec tenth meeting this. like theres rush anything.... absolutely right. People still denial witnessed responses statement. 74 million people voted Trump. millions worship ground walks on. does, do, says, say, matters. illogical put whole fiasco feet. However, leader 330 million people significant negative impact situation unfolded. reality. promises pleasant things go afterwards they're making ""housecalls""

Instead, people whose symptoms appear consistent COVID-19 flu **but appear need hospitalization visited paramedics without ambulance**, said Steve Tracy, spokesman San Bernardino County Fire Department.

The new policy started Friday afternoon, Nov. 27, said.

**“We’re couple days it, there’s already 52% reduction transports, really helping hospitals,”** Tracy said Monday, Nov. 30. Hoo-ah! gottem! huge issue basically every ""adverse effect"" vaccines also associated virus vaccinate false dichotomy. 

The older tech, Oxford vaccine, monitor asymptomatic infections, performed well. options besides mRNA ones endless pandemic, more. 

And also possible, perhaps even probable, mRNA ones perform wonderfully comes asymptomatic infections well - know yet. Honestly agree. lost job went Safeway while. pay half making something states going pay this? know many states struggling right Ohio announced literally money can’t afford vaccinate people. relate. considered mild covid start developing severe anxiety, dread, memory lapses panic attacks. thirties. lucky afford medication therapy. Covid joke even younger people Singapore island, alright don’t, care world. talking locked down? one suggesting anything like now, part actively asshole.  sure flip flopping wearing masks help things, bad people seem possess critical thinking skills realize new info becomes available recommendations may change.

The testing bit fiasco, guy workplace wife test positive last week, company made stay home 14 days matter test result was. manager little upset corporate (it put huge bind). Well guess what, test came back positive manger freaking bit sine interacts went got tested yesterday. free testing 3-7 days get results, since symptoms gets keep working, cluster could spend week spreading people. Maybe actually mind businesses first. 

The west corrupted fabricating worse lol. 

Of course luck selfish individuals, resulted capitalism, running around spreading virus purpose, care satisfactions. want go normal things like asian countries too, hey Im lucky. Soap water better use lot evaporate skin seconds. scrub nooks crannies hands. honestly know soap superior sanitizer petri dish perspective. practicality standpoint, soap water beat sanitizer given enough time supplies. thought RI lot testing capacity. went wrong? 56 old. sad. sounds like immediate household trying wear masks limit exposures. It’s reckless. teenagers wrestling season continues despite surge. I’m truly scared. “Stadiums could full again” 

What kind fucking title this? “fewer people dying every day?” “people finally get back work?” “vulnerable people go run errands without living fear?”

Fuck people country man  Thanks clarification. thought meant CO. gotta say, simple obvious way look really turned around hope get back like normal calms down.

Thanks. shows need cautious side effects. Imagine happened loved ones

Even caused vaccine, harm done virus far greater. difficult philosophical choice, hard time believing argued good faith. people want western countries fail. Pschh thought Birx. I’m fine making fraction wealth. community service big detractor rich people though. think time valuable don’t want spend 100 hours cleaning trash side road. hope 24 oz... Glad people finally take serious warning.... Touchdown! Infected COVID. even optimistic quote itself, (IMO) stadiums packed *last* piece normalcy come back - bunch stuff missed come back that. Let’s cautious say first time pack stadiums Fall .... means summer able outdoor concerts, spring indoor dining, etc. FYI, high alcohol actually less effective. There's middle ground iirc two much little. Cuomo want remembered murdering people delaying life saving vaccine. really matter. estimate validated world Yes, definitely agree. Oh, see that! I'll delete. Thanks. You’re wrong, taking time consider going right important too. Don’t downplay negative also don’t dwell. much grateful for. Cling positive, especially know end soon. Inductive reasoning much part science deductive reasoning. I’ve literally worked research scientist. Goodbye. So, pay month's heating bill put food table week. Every little bit helps, going dramatically improve things  know

Then tell people can't thank God? certain parts Texas even know pandemic. parts see masks efforts, got bars, restaurants, churches thwarting efforts.

e- leave churches sweden? Hating president make daddy come home know Spanish flu much, much deadlier, right? patients right refuse treatment, even prisoners. exception court order administer medication prisoner mentally ill. I’m sure courts force prisoners take Covid vaccine though.

If don’t want get vaccine it’s fine me. rest us! Largest geographically, anyone wondering.

Still big population, two million, part Inland Empire, basically part greater Los Angeles area. like DNA test Bin Ladens corpse got results hours.

People claimed fake takes weeks criminal DNA forgetting massive backlog Makeshift morgues ?  test negative flight?

I ask let us forget person tested negative flight tested positive upon arrival (another reason 1 negative test indicator anything disease free pass). guess pandemic literally never end.

Or idea you’re talking about. two options didnt need leaked government map tell that. Everybody enjoys right considered innocent proven otherwise. thing consider couple won’t likely serve jail time even if/when convicted benefit keep locked then? 15 year old preexisting impaired daily living. 17 years not. house, rate 1 2. don’t personally know doesn’t mean aren’t there. Also kid hid covid diagnosis request (former) coach. post Thanksgiving surge people insisting stuff hoax die. doubt make difference. 

People selfish think guidelines apply they're special something Stop Patrick, scaring him! hard option Speaking Popeyes, Brazil, launched sandwich months ago (and already sandwiches menu, ""that"" sandwich, branded ""**The Sandwich**""), they're going all-in scarcity marketing: one-per-person launch, unlimited, gone again, they're promoting trips Guadalajara (where sandwich apparently available)...

Meanwhile, KFC (which also sandwiches before), widely launched version sandwich, called ""Kentucky Chicken Sandwich"". juncture, anyone surprised this? Easy say yikes lost job raising newborn pandemic. great watching Republicans take vacations instead coming kind logical helpful conclusion. Yet people say ""you right complain, grateful, least got something"" flick us penny pat us head. last two questions rhetorical even regulators don’t data.

Ofcourse do. get idea data? covered trial results. Oh wow. Truly fascinating! Thanks insight. man! Leisure shopping best! 

In experience many shoppers come across seem leisurely shopping, carts, browsing around. mind much mid day week, clogging lanes peak rush hours highly annoying happens time. know. I'm talking now. feel perspective, come across poorly. I've learned one thing therapy, diminish personal problems comparing others. hard. Thanks much! Hmmmm, recall always stay home orders combat more. Thinking vaccine rollout, extra careful give credence tinfoil hattists bad actors seize bad news beginning. example, first million people take it, course getting serious side effects, though statistically hopefully many. trials tens thousands show side effects warranting stopping rollout. Yet -- absolute numbers plenty stories tell, look them. price know we're paying get 95% immunity. 

Consider give 20 million people vaccine US, let's make sure compare alternative. current rate, 20,000,000 unvaccinated people -- maybe 10% could get sickened within several months get vaccinated. least 0.5%-1% might die -- 10,000-20,000 deaths 20,000,000 vaccinations could prevent!

So wary bad faith media drumming individual scare stories easily. pay attention stupid let sink vaccine rollout starts. hit nail head, they've eroded trust previous lies ridiculous policies, unfortunately goes back loooong time. recent example flip flopping lying Dr Fauci undermines contrarians, they're much ""don't trust anything government says.""

**I think ONE WAY get anti-vaxxers board, could huge win world, science whole:**

*1.* invite selected ""prominent""/popular anti-vaxxers pharmaceutical companies 1 day.

*2.* allow randomly select 10 vials vaccine production line, anti-vaxxers full control follow vials. never leave sight day.

*3.* 10 prominent politicians, including Prime Minister several others, proposed anti-vaxxers themselves, show pharmaceutical company get injected vials selected production line.

*4.* entire thing broadcast live ""stunt"" show anti-vaxxers, (and genuine concerns) around world even though vaccine may 100% safe, (or rather long-term effects vaccine somewhat unknown point), politicians willing take risk worth us all.

*5.* opinion something like would much successful FAR information campaign put together, matter much money spend it. 100%
Actually I'm finding also almost calling people shows wearing mask. Given prison industrial complex they're largely exploited source cheap labor used population control device (and disenfranchise minorities), I'll supporting vaccinating we've fucked enough, prisons enormously high attack rates, vaccinating protect surrounding communities. There's good chance much higher tolerance risk. risk serious side effects low efficacy. Wow, ridiculous. I'm currently day 6 mild symptoms. like bad flu (rollercoaster) down. Tylenol eliminates 70% symptoms. Thinking negative cause chain reaction anxiety. help anything. FF's obese weight working 24+ hour shifts nearly do. Also many remaining paid departments required become paramedics well serve double duty. took test flight, found negative flight. eye eye world goes blind Either way barometer focus right now. get it’s “end point” fuck one step time. focusing pressure restrictive social distancing measures consequences violators? No, instead gives full fucking interview dreaming getting back normal rather focusing Reading comprehension++.

I said 'brand new' sense developed 2020. mRNA technique associated technologies researched developed many years. Good thing 70 million people seem care country whole. COVID represent American Dream (nightmare) hasn’t happened countries government provides health insurance. It’s hardly inevitable. markets things different health insurance market.

Health insurance companies take people’s money, try find reasons shouldn’t provide service they’re paid for. surprise charges fact. don’t let companies industries this.

I health insurance US, don’t think I’m getting money’s worth. think people paying taxes paying premiums, co-pays, getting better deal. KNOW they’re paying lot less medications do. easily past 3k deaths per day. Thanksgiving caused infection deaths wont show another week more. He’s one heroes right now.  Maybe, changing process would lead people saying short-cuts taken safety - particularly standard practice FDA calculations raw data, regulators tend review results calculated drug companies trust little long look credible used right methods. Foreign psyops spreading misinformation covid - much easier dropping bombs. Especially people spreading. He’s hero pandemic. feel bad hate gets far right, think he’s intelligent navigating COVID stuff. Pay wall like usual. ya give roughly two games team becomes pointless. don’t want watch team play quarterbacks don’t want watch people get sick even young, healthy, rich fuck athletes. wait wait pandemic play football. know it’s “normalcy” nothing normal preserve ourselves, bodies minds, faster over. Imagine getting people loved ones places outside driving distance. vaccine coming. 
The vaccinde coming
The vaccine coming coming town. 1649 deaths 2 top 10 states reporting worldometer. Yep 3k+. sad day. pesky people burning building carry provide care for. FF's paramedic's now. What's solution rescue people? Focus control. Let everything else slide away. ability change policy moment. get bogged crap. Hang months, get vaccinated move life. What's clear know numbers are. say read them. sir loud idiot, I'm sure heard people slowly ghost real life well.

Detroit/Wayne county 38.6 assaults violent crime per 100,000 people montly. People would say Detroit violent dangerous city. safe idiot go certain areas Wayne county.

Wayne 3380 corona cases per 100,000 past month. usually understand correctly.  NFL going figure something soon, they’re isn’t working. Imagine someone like Mahomes testing positive day AFC championship game?

They’re either going huge bubble pull unethical/illegal strings get players early access vaccine. many people also saying mRNA vaccines brand new simply true.

what ***existing synthetic*** mRNA vaccine humans? Either way, likly, though hard say much trend much backlog, quiet states seeing big jumps numbers vs yesterday. temporary. Show compassion. wife live took $1 million term policies February. exam consisted EMT coming house taking blood pressure readings blood sample. thorough exam. Perhaps detect certain horrible cancers whatnot blood samples. dunno. policies approved $35/mo each. late 30s. UK approving use, we’ll see well works might convince people get around world. Yes, many places vast majority people wear masks. Sadly many places like bars restaurants though. messaging Canada indicates 2021 won’t change basically anything, vaccine not. Sigh much get paid? released serving time waiting time due cash bail.

They released amongst elderly shop next local grocer.

Would prefer vaccinated Federal government it?

I curious. Yeah, does. hell else would mean. second line second fucking wave. Hope time next year, things way better. Right, time there's enough anecdotal evidence take risk seriously, opposed Trump attitude ""for 99% people get totally harmless!"" 15 days, wanted check see well surgery. Here's speedy recovery. could call ever, you’d fucking wrong. Giving someone something doesn’t help actually fix situation useless. reasoning ignores countervailing factors, asymptomatic people may likely spread due behavioral differences symptomatic people. 

Together evidence asymptomatic people often similar viral loads symptomatic people, person bar without symptoms may likely spread person home bed cough. 

If vaccines keep people getting symptoms keep getting infected able spread it, still possible could spread more, less severe people. 

Your ""inductive reasoning"" taking things like account. can't take things vacuum make declaration certainty. knew virus spreads night. Right? LOL. never said important investment vehicle (a better word would Hedge). However, way required way health insurance is. Lockdown, gripping story woman spent year browsing reddit pajamas eating potato chips. Stadiums backed event allows **everything** back, including said.

It’s stadiums packed best part .... it’s *if* stadium packed people, back normal 2019, people allowed work, less people dying, etc. Yep, indoor person fine 3months started feeling it. Cant imagine extroverts. worried still am. Lol, michigan like 2-4 losing 0-5 Penn State team? Yep - exactly this. Also engineering (tech) reason industry there's cultural pressure constantly sing praises occupation talk passionate professional loves job. reason can't relate coworkers; come bunch fake plastic wage slaves willing compromise semblance genuine personality favor whatever takes beg promotion. \*Especially\* people 30 eagerly pull nighters meet deadline projects often ultimately cancelled. school think professionalism means craftsman's pride ones work really much kool aid chug expense anything else life.

Excuse constantly expressing I'm overflowing passion sit WFH jail cell crank work enrich shareholder wealth billionaires top company. unpopular see wage slavery means end big tech company basically 1984 far company culture believe secretly 80%+ people hate role resent pretend fake positive passionate person. 2020 want thank logic thank reality... many ways watching wither away 1) wear surgical masks N95’s so...

2) Viral dose matters, rando person isn’t going around sick patients 12 hours stretch poorly ventilated environments like test subjects.

Come let’s stick honest leave propaganda fringe “news” media outlets. That's awful, sorry hear - 

But I'm agreeing - they're there, hope we're finding prevalent friends current location spend Christmas with?  must missed one, remember hearing all. asked wear mask, keep distance, wash hands. restaurants bars, restrictions toothless. things ""got bad"" previous generations, eighteen-year-olds pulled families, handed rifle, sent across world brought back box flag top.

As far government control goes, nothing compared powers government already asserted, continues reserve day. don’t care killing someone 10g’s know they’ll never pay couple hours community service. Doubt give single solitary fuck. Person dead, don’t know them, don’t give shit problem. Oh well. 10g’s life worth you. explains everything that’s wrong society. Thanks explaining point. true. Priveledge check suppose There's nothing claims hospitalization numbers underreported holidays weekends that's illogical. would define trouble breathing covid symptom? fever breathing feel normal, say I'm trouble breathing. typical cold flu. people arent getting 5$. getting nothing said normalcy? Usually good hands. 

Alcohol dry hands out, usually chemically irritated grandpa started LIRP 2. medical history required.

Glad did. fees frontloaded pre-existing conditions would make getting insured impossible. LIRPs scam I'm glad one. Running water key anyone know officials found positive could arrested? love spent money end jail. Instant karma, still enough punishment. endangered everyone flight there's also intent harm everyone would come contact gone unnoticed. another thread brought thing somebody pointed failing education system, totally true. thing highly educated right wing people like boss think liberal conspiracy go away Biden office. Depends big country is. number User floating around herd immunity 70% population needs form immunity either infection inoculation (vaccines) that's choosing beggar beggar isnt getting gift all. ""defunded"" fire depts straight made half every fire station medical-only half fire-only. firefighters supported idea beginning loving -- get fight fires, deal another chronic medical issue. That's call ""defunding"" them, asked wanted. Answer: ""do firemen stuff"", ok here's looks like. Everyone happy. Coo coo ca choo! It'll great mental health. possibility terrible psychical health family yourself. addition, would putting public health risk.

How many people total Xmas? Try drive instead fly. Ask parents whoever else isolate 7-10 days getting together. common people think. still rare get virus permanent damage happens people think. made change policy Sweden. keep small children home school even someone household sick Covid. changed now. shit not. edit something. back now. basically like everyone else work Lol shit see news. Nobody talks able take horse county miss ""the big show"" EIA outbreak farms over. We're also strangers ""vaccine papers"" travel. Health certificate vet required interstate travel, destination clearly noted, good 30 days negative Coggins test within last 6 months year depending hot spot travel state. paperwork risk getting horse impounded hefty fines. joke. I've Dept. Ag board trailer check papers horses board multiple times years (usually entering fukkin Florida). 

Frankly think need recruiting Department Agriculture state vet hospitals like OSU Auburn run end shitshow. know get done. think important stand. government anything support local small businesses. think opening everything solution btw think symbol certain places getting desperate receiving help. government forces places shut means support them. like I'm everything shutting rent food covered not. unemployment employment 2 big issues employment isnt giving much two jobs virus started. One job let go COVID, able collect unemployment job cut hours low made $150 week.

 making good money $600. felt amazing. paying bills time. putting money savings. paying debt. able put time portfolio job actually got degree in.

 Money ran fast. Savings able make ran fast. I've applying 5 jobs week since started, sometimes more. Coronavirus, able get job weeks, easily. Now, I'm even getting call backs. guy, qualifications. Less jobs apply too. job given hours back, I'm gig economy shit make ends meet right now.

  extra money, KNEW temporary. spend wildly. runs like unemployment runs out. I've looking job. Guess what? There's less jobs people looking them. easy. saw nothing pointing direction bashing UK, mention approvals done similar timelines political race first, like Russia did.

You re-read full statement then. suggested EU process thorough without offering proof UK cutting UK intention first western countries political reasons, ridiculous dangerous.

This complete speculation part. precedents MHRA rushing vaccine approval political reasons? reason wildly speculating apart pro-EU bias? Ed! serious fault current administration real leadership pandemic entire year ones left states decide  cold blooded murder someone shot face.

911 mass casuality terrorist attack. Well low causality compared retribution covid... Combine vaccine rollout. Low infection numbers increasing protection? Sign up. said 9 months grounds assume that’s immunity isn’t long enough 

I didn’t say lied said need respect science Well that’s one way keep hospitalisations down. study, they're looking people already hospitalized, may confound things (because they're already hospitalized, must signs/symptoms something already). 

I'm assuming results would also apply -- least lesser degree -- people outside hospitals many people go hospital people go hospital probably need to, get admitted anyways (I've done before, doctor admitted said ""If send home, know come back anxiety"").

As interesting point, diminished O2 saturation symptom (which subjective patient's view) would many times subjective symptoms go along them. frequently case hypoxia high-blood pressure, good idea check routinely -- especially right people visiting doctors less. Pretty much. never stopped working I’m getting 24 hours week... pay $100 week daycare since sons school closed still bills pay. I’m even living paycheck paycheck now. I’m dipping savings keep working schools shut down... sucks. No, hasn't. estimate directly disproven every developed country. He's dead wrong.

And that's also irrelevant. know study bunk simply reported false positive rate. Even got right answer, would chance. Got it. know vaccine trials double blind? I'm confused, Americans already past point return Hospital system predicted collapse somewhere around December 20th? Even interstate patient transfers? mean, suppose could always made worse, impression tragedy already inevitable now. micro chip thing odd, would government that... nearly every american already willingly pays carry tracking device (with cameras microphone) around pocket already. Snowden already gave hard proof many us expected years ago, yet hardly anyone seems care. that’s said guy 6 months ago said people never shake hands again. live drive-thru state east coast way beaches warmer weather. past weeks, probably see one state license plate every three state plates see. I’m assuming it’s mix snow birders migrating Thanksgiving travel, holy crap, there’s many people traveling right it’s insane. hospitals state already ship state’s. Yeh thats thought till girlfriend (scientist) showed wrong.

The end goal vaccine prevent getting virus. thats perfected.

Right vaccines able chance making less sick. 

This isnt like flu like theyve working virus countless years. Even constantly changing adapt mutations. top even chance get flu.

But corona virus brand new. going years vaccine could chance prevent virus entirely.

I really gotta go though ima stop. like science behind youll love read. found ton new stuff year. 

If look articles,(for corona vaccines) dont say 90% chance stop corona. say 90% effective preventing disease.(you still virus)

They also say unclear whether vaccine prevent people show symtoms mild symptoms spreading virus.

Anyways good luck ya next time. jump January already ? 

Clearly biggest casualty event America simply unavoidable, get rough part please ? IMO makes sense take care starving baristas shortage though, that's wrong. simple set math equations. introduce vaccine numbers high chance transmission high. that, lower spread. Giving people noble certainly I'm sure could debate deserving based morality chart, math. literal calculation stop spread. way? Saint Andrew New York seems disagree. De santis ""crazy"" one keeping schools open. That's CNN told least WTF? noticed top level comment removed?

Are mods fucking serious? tell post delete anyway? remember argument “but we’ve never created vaccine coronavirus!” It’s refreshing know that’s irrelevant fact. Ah, see discrepancy lies. 
It's response within bmj.

Why understanding terrible? live get free vaccine? People dying. Oh look Sweden's head covid guy everyone says never wanted herd immunity! he's talking herd immunity again! strange! surreal absolutely useless government proven combatting pandemic, far I'm concerned social contract made null, cant count government put saving lives (and even damn economy) politics, consider beneficial relationship? parasitism. Still work he's symptomatic health. We’ve also got vaccine approved shortly, talking seriously. it’s headline headline overwhelmed hospitals they’re sitting vaccine now. point is, even remove covid deaths, there’s still substantial decrease in’s earths causes. unless there’s also something besides covid pumping numbers don’t see point true. preexisting conditions, may still need costly hospitalization. Maybe die, someone else could come contact might.

Also post literally younger person dying coronavirus, higher infection rate death rate flu, let alone common cold, far less dangerous either. I’m man. bullshit bureaucracy. UK approval unsafe? not, DEFINITION US EU taking time necessary result people dying. Congrats mates rightfully gave look. Anything 94 consider requiring treatment (unless COPD similar). slippery slope! stupid someone, figure. disagree. think new administration focus agenda health care reform replenishing national PPE stockpile. FDA looking spreadsheet saying, ""The numbers check out.""

They're looking medical records people got disease.

It's maybe slight exaggeration, much, say somebody vaccine arm trial fell ladder broke leg FDA making sure vaccine somehow weakened bones.

Also, obviously sooner start injecting people better, like waiting one week pushes everybody's vaccine back one week. bottleneck going remain number vaccines manufactured quite time. number people vaccinated mid January (or, heck, probably Dec 31) probably approve today next Thursday. 

But also, yes, small number people would get vaccine tomorrow approved today, extra week delay vaccine's maximum immunity kicks means get sick possibly die approved today. 

That measured people resist getting vaccine believe rushed, also nonzero number people. Part ""dotting every i, crossing every t"" strategy belief public health officials little extra methodical today save lives total. Yea totally thing straw man one? saved long THANK BENNINGTON, MAY ANOTHER? Get rid weak dont make money lose point they’re specifically getting anything. people are. them. point, even mind rhetoric used try reverse the, honestly, irreparable damage caused far Trump administration. Idiots still listen least start trying something. seeing 5K deaths per day couple weeks. sad probably sustained weeks new year. believe insurance morphed now? help math taught completely different parents taught. can't help kids know material. medical advancements Russia. censore information flow deeply rooted corruption, affect actual effectiveness vaccine thoroughness medical trials, etc.

This reason people afraid Russian/Chinese vaccines, unbiased. use hand sanitizer avoid exposing bunch new risks There's profit that. Saints Superdome 2006 again. I'm going fucking love this. Historically century yeah, I'm crossing fingers. doesn’t seem good....? Better sharp stick eye, would thought it’d much effective. asked doctor one. like Favipiravir. get one? going much data economic, sociological, epidemic research next 20 years. Never human history undertaken many broad social experiments simultaneously.

If horrific outcomes it'd something worth getting excited for. parity outcome many countries indicate strategy unique. guy reliable?

I read whole thing yet (I dinner) say anything making existing autoimmune conditions worse? SEC colleges way, football stadiums would full Saturday! think I'll feel like I'm 18 going first bar allowed back in. 

Kind exciting get another 'first' many things. British Medical Journal, rather response article.

And frankly, pretty terrible interpretation trial data. I'm sure intentional, reasons state.

Prove it. think understand world works. products birth death. marketed conditioned every step way. Humanity sold long ago. Whether believe history true not, insurance now, capitalism, profit obsessed economy. hey! addressing investment company whose product peddling desperation? That's Staten Island went get vasectomy passed bed shot. Would similarly brush someone broke house sole items needed feed children one helping them? Im sure politicians refuse vaccine well... point likely determine (and families) option first line vaccine.... (and watch rest freedoms get limited still unvaccinated, wait vaccine become available common person). century let’s hope scientists, billionaire oligarch ruling class handle everything. dont reach 15,000 new cases safety measures place.

Yes do. Look California. isn’t 95% relative placebo group, general life? Meaning that, assumption PH measures accounted study *everyone* placebo vaccine test groups using said PH measures. people “facts logic” sure hate historical facts Yeah, know USA said bought early 100k doses. approved yet Pfizer batches ready ship, bet would willing take money them. long meet contract dates suspect inventory opened first one cash. comments make question flair go Japan. aren’t importing Pfizer. manufacture said: ""When look current data..."" would consider anything two months old current.

I also said: ""have followed much trajectory throughout pandemic"" referring entire period.

The graphs perfectly match said - currently US Swedish numbers practically clones other, overall followed *much same* trajectory.

The noticeable difference much lower ""baseline"" achieved Sweden trough two waves. could argued US currently third wave smaller one occurring Week 27 Week 37. 

Interestingly, Sweden slight increase cases Week 31 Week 35, maybe wave averted time too... So, mean? self-quarantine? isolate could catch it? would Biden change? true contagious anymore Yeah, guy wanted team

Not wanted whom? clearly wanted administration views mirrored preferred administration policy.

I wait. googled

* detroit covid hospital bodies hall

and looked several resulting articles. results tossed in, restrict search like, April 10 - April 30.

There number articles different media organizations; I'm sure ones currently acceptable certain segments population, possible articles reference CNN report, could look see might ""acceptable"" relatives. Yeah. Venn diagram people screech wearing masks people get vaccine probably close single circle. Wait get able post threads biweekly anymore? not? look excess deaths fall winter.

We have. any. Deaths noisy enough need sizable spike see. Even hospitalizations influenza-like illness variable enough need fair amount noticeable.

What definitive viral RNA, never found early. reason paper almost certainly wrong. There's also obvious problem disease would quiet months apparent reason height cold flu season. given something free, complain enough.

Beggars can't choosers, free get complain. ask resolution? said fucked up. never said change. Things fucked still exist. think would behoove us least consider health care workers front-line professions choice whether work perhaps remove COVID-related clauses policies. Seems like humane thing do. understand qualms, putting kind restriction discussion debate -- fear someone take extreme -- help either. thorny ethical issue contributes stalled progress. Ironically, population numbers drop, violent way possible, civilizations start collapse. point, ethical nuances swept away, too. feels like lose-lose matter direction look. Oh good, warnings. People listen time... Possibly life expectancy men 65. Less journalist. guy asking get arrested TV day declaring would violate restrictions. would take vaccine heartbeat. vaccine tourist China please? Lol UK managed sift data approve vaccine today. US 2 weeks behind? UK cut corners process unnecessarily time consuming given situation? Theres also leaked data government documents bigfoot Right, directive, outright falsehood, pretty convinced spread intentional.   Napa less hour SF lol that’s pretty close man refreshing government finally recognized we've witnessed nearly every single day since pandemic started. US, every day presents new historically high risk going outside. soap since march - works well. understand people consuming ever pandemic would never able without donald trumps help! Really 1918-1919. Estimated One third worlds population infected big question work faster investigate less.  tracking LOL

Such conviction impervious dissuasion. 

Pics mate! Yeah well we’re trying philosophy that’s reason pandemic going us next years. Im going bash US live Texas 15000 people day catching shit. better we're choosing to. I’ve flown 3 flights. Everything went fine. I'm going balance optimism healthy pessimism (this violate subreddit rules trust).

By time next year, less half population vaccinated (according skeptical estimation) logistical difficulties widespread lack cooperation health authorities. Even Biden supremely well organized communicates well. Please, please prove wrong. Exactly. vaccines rushed without proper testing, possibly run another DengVaxia fiasco erupted Philippines. mean, didn't, likely would seen 200% increase week. Why? shits heard. 
I bet ya love praise west Africa too. Nice Fauci warp speed head think April june could normal going argue that

What’s wrong listening experts. Seriously dude. know you’ll never fraction qualified argue? Stay indoors man. could wrong, I’m doctor use google link shows infection fatality rate 20-49 year olds 0.0092% less younger ages? proves point...?? Many us fear virus.  right do. warned days ago. Thanks. think US election swayed things Biden Ireland etc. me, it’s schools closed.

My children suffering mightily near ruining life.

It’s hard understand ridiculously fortunate compared others. Oxford doesnt burden proof issues placebo group. sure think relevance is. 

 

If want speak actual qualifications instead 'he's near lot hospitals' feel free. 

 

If want make vague guess, I'll pass reading them. Yeah that's complete bullshit, sub shitty Craigslist deals. families lives upturned due global pandemic receiving help need dutifully paying taxes whole life. Suck government's dick more, complacent moron.  many cases unemployed better even made money employed. 


Can cite source this? happened put words mouth never said typed. upcoming lockdowns, might benefit reading comprehension classes time for.

BTW, end ""more suffering"" starting sensible things countries meantime. We're suffering begin end time. Next up... spitting hands rubbing as... oh wait. That’s fault educated enough. I'm even sure truther supposed be. dont think so, think he's smart guy realizes everybody world covid get company over. Thats nearly different pastors say ""you covid cause gay"" another pandemic. severity worse knows. Normally riders NJ beat shit someone like. person relieved got ticket. That’s unambiguous really. Look AIDS. certainly better nothing. found positive testing specific event. like masks, make perfect enemy good.  Seattle autonomous zone: left alone 24 days.

This guy: arrested immediately.

I hope takes criminal trial basically says defense, ""It's bar, want.""  It’s unemployed people’s fault, aren’t bad guys. It’s Republicans holding stimulus money could possibly know manifest Alzheimer’s? Stadiums won’t full majority countries cities. wealthy ones That's exactly kind tribal bullshit got us here. Discard nuance, discussion, either us us.

Screaming antivaxxer anyone even hesitant slow uptake down. entitled silly opinion, factually clear saying two different things same, able convince otherwise (I mean, even argument? quite obviously different thing put justification controversial? mean anything). least understand stuff like make actual conspiracy theorists regular people much medicine. 50 million people died first though.... mRNA vaccines mRNA Covid. Unless NZ country unlikely encounter Covid, nothing lose getting vaccinated. Arkansas. Everywhere. hospital ran ICU beds. 0/16 available. Yikes. I've looking source like this. Thanks posting. weed money... why, shits heard? zzzz Yeah even though whole world won’t vaccinated while, reassuring watching everything start go weeks vaccines released. Twitter comments governor’s RGJ article crazy. total cognitive dissonance. 

“See supposed garage hospital empty full unused equipment !”

&lt;rebuttal article actual patients used equipment

But correct may true. That’s it’ll come to—putting foot family members. I’m worried aspects can’t control like airplanes nurses pediatrician appointments though. Bah. SIL seem approach. therapist said need practice active listening. I'm hearing correctly, white house saying a....*checks notes*...very dangerous situation. saying? thank you. Fauci lied greater good public expect another one. Come see end summer though. I'll wait excuses happen. kill people? it’s parents? Grandparents? Kids? People need someone blame. You’re different. isn’t sorry didn’t know, knew went anyways. would feel reason someone cared died? Doubt you’d feel way. You’d want dead knew could spread deadly virus didn’t give one shit. weekend right holiday. Stunning explain this. know statisticians people compile stats off? Oh wow. Good know! Thank you!  sorry! That’s complete bullshit doesn’t sound legal. say suffer more. I'm saying behave we're last get cookie

You *did* though. said get vaccine last. Tge effect would suffering.  attacking people unemployed absolutely nothing allow politicians continue take money demonize people much better situation yourself. Man remember popeyes taste know before. Tried uber eats one time. left resturant minute later got message saying order got cancelled driver find place like boooshieeet.

Then churchs sucked.

fried chicken (if delivery korean fried chicken) think sucks delivered. Trump campaign...Russia...same thing, goals James K called Capitol Hill Autonomous Domain. population largely treated mitigation efforts seriousness Texans, much hope for.

Might well, since people going stay home distance.

It's better praying covid away. basing accusation something, wank stain? Oh snap! free get complain.

What crock shit disaster shelters, presumably. believe covid last Dec. family member 4 week untreatable ""flu/cold"" situation December.

That say know origin covid is, enough study rule country yet. 2nd comment people already trashing rural people 

You part problem Love post much! realize works fuckton people public health correct real problem overtaxed healthcare system facilities materials fight it. limited sure, lot easier produce those. real issue producing enough doctors nurses. already see nurse shortages across US. early days nurses came country hotspots help cause local hospitals struggling yet. everywhere struggling, one personnel spare. Even said, ""fuck it, let rage buff healthcare compensate,"" cant magically make trained professionals appear nowhere. saw movie once, that's I'm going on. Hollywood production too, hardly think suggest tearing fabric reality. complicated. read CDC charts studies .... arggghhh drove one going house getting drive-by flu shot. many months... many home cooked meals....need....super-fried......fried chicken! long term effects would already shown trial significant impact. I’m happy see group “tested positive diagnosed...” diagnosed Covid illness makes sense timeline symptoms. couple times denied treatment via study never tested positive. think doctors much open labeling Covid diagnostics alone. someone thinks need life insurance better getting likely underwritten older likely health issues. 

But yes, implications getting insured road, life health pre-existing conditions allowed denied, major disincentive tested. one seems care exact things exist American politics though...... well, unless there's R next name. there's D, one gives shit. largest number Covid cases Vegas Golden Knights history. Holy cow that's incredibly disturbing lol Lol. Maybe lockdown ineffective people ignoring it. Tbf historic achievement. We've never vaccine quick understandably alot people thought best shot would next year 24 48 hours prior use 72 hour test? Scientists. science itself, simply method. scientists religious people too. field science isn’t exclusive people don’t believe higher power. understand urge get go backpacking camping. I'd consider still lived Texas. still gotta avoid indoor restaurants hotels, mask brief visits stores supplies. People thinking take sort luxury vacation pandemic beyond selfish. tell me. I’m one said confused maybe could help clarify position here. 

Do believe covid exists? guess that’s square one ya huh, bud? rest world already knew this, hence closed borders Americans Ah, Darjeeling Tea truly best. Earl Grey cannot compete that. delivery costs fucking high here! obvious negative effects ridiculously wasteful, vindictive, inaccessible healthcare system U.S., especially scenario pandemic, pointed all. testing article mentions one example.  
 
However one aspect problem think greater contribution spread get worse time. problem cultivation within low-income working class lack faith healthcare best and, worst, extreme distrust medical institutions *especially* time faith institutions decline generally. come poor southern family. People just... go see doctor unless emergency. can't afford it. breeds sort skepticism healthcare many times gets aimed ""doctors"" general, skepticism remember existing prior pandemic (for example doctors talked way lawyers back 90s tv movies). system forces doctors put almost adversarial position uninsured patients. healthy society dealing large scale health crises. Combine lack faith political system wonder many people led believe institutions lying them, doctors cannot trusted, etc. least due fact that, time many told need sacrifice, patient, spread 'our fault' right thing, economy danger etc, people like Musk Bezos making extremely well. exactly inspire trust confidence. I'm surprised took long Insurance companies charge fee smoke tobacco right now. think that's poster means comprehensive list policies enacted state whether still effect.

**THIS EVENT SO-CALLED ""MILD"" INFECTION**

- Avoid Close Contact

- Wash hands well &amp; often

- Wear mask. 22% *global* cases COVID, US, 18% global deaths COVID exposure/infection. 

We're great #1, definitely time celebrate. 

The whole pandemic confusingly mismanaged US, even guidelines, laws policies place limit crowds exposure, nobody, *literally nobody* cares listens. 

People wear masks, public, go aisles stores wrong way, fail read arrows signs, keep distance, *pull mask sneeze cough*, atrocious. 

We're going dealing many years, ignorance apathy people states. thought couple days ago. wonderful news Pfizer moderna (the better!) wondered “what vaccine didn’t work, ever?” eventually go days knowing going ravage world indefinite amount time? terrible thought. Fair. I’ve noticed don’t posts anymore say “x cases reported US today.”

Like said, I’m bad numbers didn’t know things gotten better lull think be, homeschooling regulated too. Children human beings, private property parents. Even 30% took numbers would drop massively. also think lot change mind actually mean life restarting. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article  going distributed age occupation. Frontline healthcare workers, care home workers, care home residents top list. priority changes increments 5 years. starting everyone 50+ vaccinated healthcare workers. dint think exact details released phase 2 yet itll likely similar going 45-50 down. Prayer. Yeah. That's solution. hear eyeballs rolling?  “The vaccines may give sterilizing immunity, could still spread virus getting shot. Therefore need wear masks social distance another year.”

No joke, I’ve seen people arguing reason can’t get back normal till 2022 grim timeline like that. Fortunately people seem disagree. think already answered question. can't find reputable source prove gone proper trials something put body. You’re right never would admit made huge mistake (time again) School never opened here... wish was. Thank God Trump funding this... Fucking Kidding!! Go German, Go Science Go Vaccines! It’s clearly safe else would approved Oh yes, prayer ought really wrangle baby now. start use makeshift field hospitals. push back morons fight supposed rights instead caring fellow countrymen.

I guess small business owners fellow countrymen longer? also interact plenty sick people. live small town volunteer fire department always first arrive, usually least 10 minutes ambulance, someone calls 911 health emergency. WI getting bad day. amount maskless people us getting scary. But, places gathering like Walmart Sam's Club want enforce mask policy afraid piss customer base.

There article hospital added beds ambulance garage able accommodate  Good. champagne socialist also pretty big asshole like Trump. Use poor degenerates street rob blind. real struggle, idealism wealth. Trump manage turn America red!

Red hats go red alert, 4D chess! think posted video trust Royal Family? simply show pushed powerful, rich people. know anyone could make logical case including them. nature jobs, often rush blind situation without idea might interacting with. 

And addition, given CRITICAL nature jobs, society vested interest making sure stay healthy. way.  come havent got covid yet? It’s cause hundreds millions people normal immune systems can’t get sick. Open world back up. NOW. found best friend, two siblings, parents covid. live rural Pennsylvania raging area. thought would fine, wrong. Nobody around wears mask. Probably like 100x hell, lot really surprised people (well already are)...""But went church!!!"", ""But lunatic hateful a-hole"". that’s given temporary reprieve life streets shelters.""

...because they're going right back streets over, right? Jesus. Talk missed opportunity improve society. Imagine money spent treating homeless permanently healthcare patients.

I guess Joker right, nobody panics things go ""according plan"" even plan horrifying. Next breaking leak: Old Faithful erupt Yellowstone people healthier CA, WA generally need beds? one watches fox news. remember severely chastised herds Swedes several months ago commented herd immunity approach ridiculous ignorant. 

Guess smart might like think. 

Any Swede agreed policy leave apology comments. Yeah biggest issue me. anything look forward too. work dead hours. did...old news. parents live Michigan, types believe dangers virus over-exaggerated, booked vacation Florida January exactly prices cheap Covid restrictions lot less strict home state 'relax'. Sigh.  I've heard quite people badly smoke affected lungs. worst year smoke I've since Colorado. hope affected much, surprised non-zero impact. difference Reddit comments Facebook comments story line crazy. Nice see actual discussions Reddit rather conspiracy theories wine want. London answer Brussels/Berlin. Sadly, can't type vaccine made/used ever before. publicly stated, side effects largely unknown discovered vaccine in-action. last vaccine m-RNA injections caused extreme side effects animal testing btw completely left vaccine. testing phases would needed much longer approval quickly insane irresponsible. PM want sources infos stated they're made :) time release Cyberpunk!  Shouldnt cause many issues I've read. Shipping delays could roadblock vaccine likely flown skip queues customs fast tracked. I’m confused first you’re saying don’t trust elites. you’re posting video elites “great reset” even opinion troll? Yep pretty much. requesting brother taking word socially distancing. tho? dud invent vaccine. Good. Fuck kinds owners people... Americans dying here.  fuck government nothing prevent owners feeling get point. haha. fact, it’s simply gotten worse. 😕  *Cybeasterpunk 2077* ""I told lepers stay outside camp. socially distancing germ theory disease.""

 - Yhwy Spoiler: won't. right here. Dems never play hardball push things. interact non-sick people hospital staff do, among important people immunize. goodness need get Popeyes everybody else going vacation? gone 3 hr drive direction since March. Rocky Mountains 3 hour drive. 

This pandemic makes feel two things--we universal healthcare--we give anyone anything people stupid. don't.. stop spreading bullshit. We've following recommendations still havent closed country. personally think we've handled lot better countries. clue talking about, saying pretending like Canadians different Americans values like splitting hairs, pointing prejudiced say said Americans general. agree. amount medical responsibilities fire fighters taken past years absolutely near front line! Thanks service matter danger! 👍 fantastic point consider looked more. I'm sure literally millions people consider thinking it, especially since think majority looked vaccine trials. There's many unprecedented things associated virus vaccine, think part problem keeping developments. Especially sea misinformation Trump allowed happen. make political, fact, lot ""action"" wording led that. least people know businesses safe enter now? 🤔 better nothing! old “masks years”

And distribution never happen take least year. honestly think control would virus an, most, 4% chance killing at-risk groups? wanted use virus method control would’ve made much deadlier flouting rules therefore difficult control would dead it. think multiple tests insufficient?  Lol hell authoritarian BS. let people believe what’s want? Seriously? shout zero evidence bring opposite zero evidence?

Most articles saying CDC going making recommendation governors final say. So, could vary state state. articles specifying ""healthcare workers"" saying ""healthcare workers families.""

Specifically, NY Times says ""21 million health care workers qualify receive first doses, won’t enough first say ""health care workers families."" would cool did, expect it. 

Like everything else pandemic, SO's benefit healthcare worker strictly SO. gets free swag stores/restaurants (like free Starbucks right now.) me. gets hazard pay bonus. me. gets PPE priority access covid testing. me.

Why expect vaccine different? Oxford's chimpanzee vector tried-and-tested. brand new mRNA. usage Vector method used specific one tested now.
  
Also saying used people before, think phased trials exactly? Sad thing learned immunology class there’s vaccine stupidity :( kisses, dog position outside. Well, also condoms. case, too, kinda don’t care. Everyone else around seems flouting rules too, it’s like anything unusual. many Thanksgivings people “just families, really, safe?” many friends “oh, friends over, know none sick”? Would prevented spreading false information sub, like always seem do? know 🙏 yelling void feels good sometimes !  America's obsession ""rights"" problematic, sides political spectrum America guilty different ways. **Capitalist America** worst member Avengers 1.2% diagnosed cases SD died. Congrats UK!!! fellow western neighbors. Please pray America. Pray available everyone vulnerable Ngl, like aspects both. I'm thinking I'll 3 days office 2 home ever ends. like able take care chores lunch hour dress commute. I'm also tired cook every meal needing play lofi hiphop background noise. like coworkers office view. like coffee shop building - baristas fun, coffee great make pumpkin spice mix scratch autumn latte actually tastes *amazing* overly sugary. Side effects usually show quite quickly vaccination longer-term effects extremely rare

Look, I'm gonna get vaccine I'm ready go back normal see way. BUT, kind disingenuous statement. Side effects vaccine technology currently use show side effects quickly (or all). mRNA vaccine technology new, theoretically safe, theoretically also know long term side effects type vaccine. everybody else going vacations shouldn’t he? works doctor- didn’t sign saint. \#yourenotwrong Exactly. Both. likely spreaders. Guys talked before, never pre-order unfinished shit smh. thing every year swear... Interesting. Well, I’ll happy take vaccine finally becomes available 30 peeps That's everyone saying Texas since May governor reopened state surging. every person since then. lucky work home, fine. lucky enough get that, risk. That's sucks. Let’s say I’m idiot (I am), don’t understand FDA waiting 1 week review/approve vaccine... could someone explain like I’m 2nd grader? Biden laptop plans Ground Zero Mosque uploaded Antifa. also secret deployment schedule taco trucks every corner migrant caravan going operate suburban neighborhoods. [10 FEMA morgue trucks loaded prisoners earning El Paso [National Guard called That's like going house, pointing cat, saying ""your dog ugly!"" *Dr Stone vibes intensifies* wyoming red Cutting close? It’s vaccine widespread distribution it’s amazing see words :) thanks pick anytime ""negative"" test taken....and pick right tested wont enough virus show positive. Testing specific events GOOD accurate rapid test, moment. Defo referring either UK US... country fucked need lockdown depends virus spreads, death rate. Ebola AIDS good examples deadly disease locking make sense. like basically since joined reddit. guilty back college. 

""Damnit..why can't healthcare system Canada, school system Finland, government similar Iceland's."" weak spot entire world since January. title ridiculous.

In Wuhan enough doctors ICU's top many doctors got sick realize soon enough contagious.

Then brought 30 thousand medical personnel country including military medical groups, equipped supplies stop people dying large numbers. also built two hospitals.

It kind news...

It's main reason lockdowns done countries. fact thats yet thousands people day still getting sick dying? Um literally did. obviously it’s way worse China. far new virus cases yes absolutely, huge drop death toll every day still awful, go eventually Imagine safe packed church though. prayer rona doesn’t stand snowballs chance hell . See there. Trump thrown jail catastrophic failure. nothing else, learning alone truly valuable thing. 

I've learn alone 20 years, I'm ready learn something else. awesome sounds, even vaccine ""supposed"" stronger ready immune system (I've already Rona guess means body able fight better next time idk one does), I'm still going paranoid hell months around people again. He’s another conservative mental backflips justify Yeah, know. hate people sometimes. least less going forward. UK gets vaccine FIRST. happened KEEP AMERICAN GREAT US #1 thing... seems like crow eat here. company made vaccine based Germany. Germany (the nation) put money towards development vaccine. Pfizer (the company owns company made vaccine) based US indeed human trials began first US. US (the nation) paid nation also pre ordered doses. thank Peru, done same? UK? profits end US mean deserve credit Nobody needs Belgium would relieving except know can’t get tested county even symptoms unless deaths door.

The epidemiological nature virus like SARS-CoV-2, necessitates need tested multiple times, regular basis, ensure stay virus-free. tested today, go public tomorrow, become infected due someone else's exposure ignorance, 10 days later, show positive second test. 

Your first test come back negative, could lead prematurely breathe sigh relief change behavior relax behaviors, making risk infection taking increased viral load. 

---

People see drop numbers (as summer months) think virus run course, **and begin behaving like has**, leads huge spike new infections re-infection. 

The numbers dropped virus weakened, **because social distancing, masking limiting businesses actually works**. nobody wants hear that, drag out, letting ""some"" businesses stay open, close, limiting hours some, others, virus continue spread. 

---

We model social distancing, ***enforced*** masking, limiting crowds *with stiff penalties violating rules*, actually works: New Zealand parts Australia. still free countries, numbers single digits per-week. 

We're 5-digit numbers *per-day* states, people actually want care. almost like *want* get infected run country ground. downside learned nothing society, everyone believe since returned normal fast overreacted took many steps didn’t need to. 

In reality, even though haven’t done enough protect everyone unnecessary amount people die, everything part reason able tackle fast (plus modern medicine science absolutely amazing) kids appreciate tried everything preserve innocence keep childhood happy time - probably hate destroying futures virus fairly low mortality rate. Furthermore article suggests older people would willing younger people. fine bc older people first ones get time later younger people able it. point think concern would reduce assuming major issues vaccine that's found distribution probably got chastised spreading false information. Sweden much heard immulity approach US free unicorn everyone approach uk free caribbean island everyone approach.

It's myth perpetuated mainly US media also others. Even Obama spreading it.

&amp;#x200B;

Please us could stop using us political tool? Dang, UK dropped Oxford vaccine like hot potato. Agreed, frustrating. friend family careful, unfortunately everywhere now. I've lost respect lot people know refuse wear mask ""covid hoax."" bet many people see news bed pajamas half awake. Doesn’t sound cool honestly real question is, get vaccinated 50 survival rate 99.9%. Long term problems hard convince there's actual studies prevalent are. know anyone paid cent covid test TN, unless needed rapid test.

Anyway, insurance government plan reimburse admin costs associated vaccine well. terrible person  large free market advocate, even admit times markets needs guidance. one times. Additionally, Americans need get educated less selfish, unfortunately situations market needs guidance going keep getting prevalent. intelligent less selfish people, market driven solution could've actually worked, would've simple people wearing masks isolating, we've seen many Asian countries. Liberty requires selfless people prosper. lack statewide response, much less national strategy, obstacle,"" said Janel Heinrich, director Public Health Madison Dane Gov. Tony Evers faced slew challenges Republicans public health orders, including stay-at-home order, mask mandate capacity limits businesses statewide. mask mandate order still place, fought state argued counties municipalities take regional approach combating COVID-19, local orders also met lawsuits conservative groups. I'm Apocalypse believer well... Also Wasteland 76!!! Well fully developed quickly easily front runner 6 months ago 

Also hedge bets, especially tried true vs new unknown good idea. Probably modeled CHOP idea susceptible severe COVID get it. get sick, you’ve lucky far. Extremely lucky wearing mask going business normal.

Even super immune system won’t get severely ill, anyone life high-risk care about? would feel guilty asymptomatic, passed died? Wonder feel now? now, valunteers get minister health said it, get ""very soon"". news sources say bought 50 million come even next year. personally gonna get vaccinated oxford, pfizer moderna vaccine gets ""western"" vaccine. asked question couldnt even get source read(maybe couldnt find it) China's sinovac. *""We know effective vaccines stopping transmission long theyll able protect vaccinated.""*
 
This much discussed, albeit largely fold, [in articles concerning initial clinical trials assess whether vaccines would reduce transmission. coming months, additional research analyze whether vaccines stopping transmission addition preventing serious illness. Scientists also hope discover long immunity lasts—another factor included initial studies.

The rest can't speak for, clearly transmission immunity duration unsettled matters moment. vegan, think militant vegans hilarious. talking results pap smear they'll interject something evils eating meat. governor Texas abandoned people trials third world countries well! [Our map lots India, Cases*
Don't know deaths argued evidence transmission vectors either. VACCINE response OP, below. Yes, facts disproved bullshit narrative. Like said, care want pretend covid big deal. fact prefer it. Keep I'm never putting money odds they'll test COVID. Thanks advice WHO! pandemic thing could gotten hand. /s Hey, hey. 
That's way long wait die. I'll 86..... planned dying 60. It’s odd even ask. 54 deaths November 22. That's half spring peak. expect keep climbing another couple weeks least probably reach around 80 per day. know get last, fucking politicians.... Lock war room get vaccine every damn one us get first. 

We vaccinated months. Half country nothing help slow spread we’re seeing record cases?! could seen coming? /s

*Unsurprised Pikachu face*  Yo, what? sole handedly responsible putting elderly home care patients tested positive Covid back nursing homes. You’re delusional Popeye’s go place get takeout. couple weeks ago great!  great news, Fauci honest cautious predictions. 

My worry learned nothing everything goes back normal, everything normal people look back say never really big deal proved everyone overreacted. It’s exhausting already large portion population thinks it’s blown.  happy. We're going kill dig hole put us in. smiles years. I've seen people optimistically say things could back, close back normal come April. read articles we'd lucky vaccine available end June. Cuomo said NYers need prepare like, September. April June... even July... sign up. what's realistic timeline? feel like two shots complicates things bit. 

For reference - realize we're moving right direction I'm happy there's light end tunnel, I'm curious would love temper expectations Rural PA too, nobody wears mask, us shunned looked like stupid! Well who's stupid now! feel bad wear one take precautions. getting deserve! coronavirus showing brains plain old stipid! Next Thursday! Dec 10th :) reason PAX East couldn’t moved fall? like specific seasonal thing? Thanks thanks. Vaccine trials rushed people reviewing political appointees.

""Autonomous Zone""? like silly ""[Sovereign thing going back? serving liquor even though lost license.  Coronapunk 2077 Eh, I'd rank fourth defense, infrastructure, education. 

But zero sum game. Boosting one boosts others various synergies. good education system produces locally trained medical professionals cheaper luring doctors abroad. Good infrastructure makes easier distribute healthcare, makes easier populace seek cheap preventative treatment instead expensive crisis care. defense defense, can't *anything* can't defend (and defense military, diplomacy effective well - best war one averted smooth talking trade deals). boost economy kept balance, gives invest back them. spam promotional nature? genuine news article..

But yeah anywhere I'd say. Masks common, means much greater good steak

It's rare see kind empathy.

Well done. I'm making excuses, I'm laying facts response different US versus countries. federal government cannot shut interstate travel, state's rights issue would ruled unconstitutional heart beat. Similarly, cannot detain American citizen unless committed crime/are suspected commiting crime, returning foreign country crime. correct, federal mask mandate enacted, federal government right enforce within states (that's 48/50 states mask mandates). things make pandemic difficult curb bedrock country cannot write think another process would efficient singular situation. becomes precedent future situations abused another situation.

eta: you’re probably talking Clemson, thing us last weekend (although doubt it’s bc thought we’d kill 😅) comment hoping see Apparently dense understand this. people wearing mask ever before, people social distancing ever before. anti mask protests 2 months ago, gatherings 2 months ago. places strict measures place still blowing up.

There studies proving masks work except they've supposedly derived pandemic, time frame areas went cold hot lockdowns. previous studies showed masks ineffective slowing spread contagion, leads people believe deleted them, order run social experiment. even tried use Kansas proof masks work counties mask mandates seen highest percentage increase. problem ridiculous logic counties 0 cases longest time, 1 case 2, course they'd highest percentage increase... looks like narrative. Sorry like hearing it, use eyes ears actually research, conclusion I've come nothing I'm seeing adding up.

Just think many times heard new coronavirus record number cases... Every damn day new record everywhere, still rise. headlines, man sensationalized like every day, totally ridiculous keep stating that, still did, keep people hyped up.

And masks work, want Fauci thrown prison criminal negligence intentionally misleading American people causing countless deaths saying masks work.

You can't ways, can't sit say okay Fauci, run studies himself, lie it, citing studies proved work, change mind everyone follow suit. way able ""prove"" people wrong initially, throw ass prison. start holding people accountable shit, keep letting get away it, they'll keep it, one believe anything anymore. way world operating, say whatever want hold high office, even blatant lies cost lives, nothing happen you. Enough enough. Look, I'm cautious anyone, post vaccine low case rates, hopefully sitting stands watching hockey next fall.

I also fight refund tickets postponed concert (now scheduled next September) think might regret next fall, either. work hospital... optional? WTAF? Yep, 2600 height peak deaths US spring and.. believe also around number total deaths reported yesterday :( Damnit. family visit occasionally.

some 90% states effectively unpopulated. get impression there's single county SD people cows.

Also, eastern SD western SD almost completely different states. Different culture certainly also there's lot native american land large national state parks black hills (western) area state.

Versus prayer, something affects absolutely nothing changes outcomes. consider reliable source? Exactly I've said freedom fucked us one... Hospital staff personal risk due viral load. exposed often higher levels virus. also suffer severe illnesses result.

The important part pandemic make sure people treat sick. Firefighters belong essential workers, also frequently interact nonsick people still jobs need done. enough vaccines cover people phase 1 1st phase 1. This. always knew people self-interested, are? idea extremely selfish are. would literally rather kill 2000 people day, slightly inconvenienced wearing mask. disheartening.

What kind Rhetoric better?

""Awww dont worry grandma know! totally okay spread disease people, could possibly held accountable actions? Even though almost every major new outlet telling careful fox news said fine, supposed deduce listen to! societies fault, yours!"" I'm also bit concerned ""long term"" effects showing blue-- might crocodile brain trying spook me. looks like using mRNA way studied while, though. first get vaccinated (not at-risk population healthcare provider) may well get available (given major, debilitating potential side effects COVID _recovery_, let alone death risk).

Further cinsider know long term effects COVID are-- say sure outcome strictly better.  think talking matter days, calm  ohhhh, thanks sharing Health Code level enforcement. ones rights infringed upon spreading disease.

If people willfully infecting others, go quarantine jail. Think way, test positive HIV unprotected sex someone communicate HIV status, get thrown jail. multiple times go prison.  indeed struggling. Current estimates somewhere around may. schools shut since March K-12. opened K-5 start November shut 3 weeks later many infections, primarily symptomatic infections kids, staff, parents.

Thing is, they've done nothing improve school conditions. know they'd think it'd fine before. “Let happen” - Tame Impala Agreed Yeah worked obese ~50 yr old woman likely went undiagnosed years years finding ER near death blood sugar level like 1300.

I'm hearing conflicting things long immunity corona virus lasts.

The cdc says corona viruses immunity around 90 days.

But read things like that's long antibodies stay system, cells trained, immune forever.

Any clarification this? kind counterintuitive call something hotspot entire thing fire? guess I'm bitching semantics, really need better designation. Disaster area? die. Masks kill momentum breath allow ventilation filter out. Breathing fuckton virus someone's face way better getting infected dissipating cloud around mask.

edit: also droplets still highly infectious, leaving face open makes easy vector infect people I’m expert, shouldn’t approach vaccinate people causing hospitals become overwhelmed i.e. elderly/vulnerable first? reduce stress hospitals people illness/problems addressed vaccinate healthcare workers protect patients. Hospital staff PPE protect patients better normal folks use cloth masks, correct? spread hospitals isn’t primary way thing spreads? Great. get ""save"" people invading bodies cutting people sticking needles injecting drugs. That's sociopath would do.

People going take vaccine willingly time anyway, please keep disgusting fingers people's bodies. Thank you. Dumb also mean uneducated. think vaccine dangerous way, reviewed research, listening experts. 

If you’re vaccine, don’t want get it, think know Fauci, FDA, CDC, Biden’s coronavirus team. favor them. I'm J&amp;J trial (although I'm separate study trialling double dose, one two months first).

and vast majority 2 - 5 days exposure, people fully show symptoms. minority outliers 7 10 days exposure. there, odds decrease every single hour present symptoms, theoretical maximum 14 days (which reported, rare extreme outliers). However, believe 80% become symptomatic within first week, usually I've reading hospitalization happens around 14th 21st days exposure. Death happens another week average. Also, given almost half people literally never become symptomatic, hard get reliable anecdotal evidence. considering children seem become symptomatic faster, less severe (literally cold worst flu 99.98% kids) hard calculate picture. states disagree this, *could* lose funding next October, yes. doubtful would light circumstances. Besides that, still states- said- determine falls categories.

Suppose SARS2 something similar...  Anyone could done thing time, many were. Indoor outdoor dining allowed. yeah friends family pretty low iq judging often misspell simple words terrible grammar never that. Enough vaccinate front line health care workers trying keep everyone else alive.

With first dose, less. Pretty sure approved (or shortly expected approved) require two doses 'fully' effective. We're certainly close, still far enough away significant loss life/potential (likely?) healthcare system collapse. vaccine allocated one approved FDA. 

How CDC suggest allocated. still governors states. America first!*

*may include fatalities prisoners Yet nobody dying... understanding average person shows symptoms 5 8 days post exposure, although range 2 14 days Stop glorifying Biden. places keep never works restrictions always happen days later * person sick Sweden, stay home lose job!

* person sick Sweden get treated without fearing bankruptcy, die less! (communism again)
* Sweden never president spread lies every chance, bullshit conspiracy theories covid19 denialism never really took hold. probably helped Swedish population educated US.
* hospitals Stockholm reached capacity, could move patients hospitals. NYC really struggled issue first wave USA bunch private businesses instead functioning public healthcare system.
* Sweden never closed schools daycare younger kids. suggested people would work home many people started working home. could push back employers keen idea without fear retribution, labor unions, worker rights, etc. understand point, don’t think understand meaning word hotspot \^this Specially things keep getting worse could shortage nurses. brother law nurse hospital worked nurses getting sick plus patients normal hire emergency 60 extra nurses come city help hospital.

Eh... seems unethical. 

I think government bribing citizens. Holy shit US get shit together. Starring Mark Wahlberg usual types movie? 🙈 Haven’t really made artwork since March don’t feel need to. hard say sure without time two things. 

1. Immunity may last much longer 6 months average infection. hard test types things virus new. Recent papers found upwards 90% people still signs immunity 6-7 months post infection. (the 10% may still level immunity hard test for)

2. major vaccines actually produce stronger immune response natural infection actually quite possible immunity vaccination lasts longer natural infection. part reason almost assuredly recommend previously infected people get vaccine. doctor, theoretically, yes. antibodies covid bind spike protein, body produce antibody exact function, show antibody test. vaccine needs super cold therefore difficult store transport summer Brazil, people lucky get first dose two needed. it’s hard get second dose, don’t, first doses wasted them.

Imagine sending millions vaccine doses country useless another vaccine could worked first one could sent elsewhere.

It's odd Americans ones chomping bit ""get back normal"" get vaccine ones least amount restrictions, hence worse case spread. perspective, yes, I'm American unemployed, kids schooling home, I'm exactly living high life. 3-6 months, would seen thousands reinfection cases, have. Recent research cells showing 8+ months (although cells SARS lasted 11 years, time give us clearer picture long term immunity covid), vaccines Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca shown result stronger immune responses actual infections. Weird news suddenly keeps getting posted everywhere right CNN obtained leaked Chinese CDC documents show China covered bad outbreak November 2019 onwards. anti-science agenda growing increasingly frugal strong correlation, positive negative, case certainly gets attention suggests somethin going requires closer examination.

Education systems produce populations arrogantly proud ignorant, anti-scientific, anti-rational mentality would help public health, make tailored messaging less necessary. [here (Nov. United States, COVID-19 kills 0.6% people infected virus..."" Yeah idk then, seen actual comments. folding cracked one leading tech companies

Wait, happen?!! Yes, clever. Let's assume Canada follows similar path US terms health care risk first. terms phased border reopening think go order:

* Point Roberts border communities/crossings depend reopening
* CBSA/US BP staff getting vaccines
* Air travelers show proof inoculation (Much easier control land crossing)
* Land travelers show proof inoculation
* People coming Regions US/Canada lower levels outbreak (In phase expect CBSA US BP reserve right refuse entry believe traveller might risk carrying could lying been)
* Border fully reopens depends antibody test testing for. vaccines produce potential antibodies could produce response natural infection. 

Most vaccine primarily targeting spike protein coronavirus. antibody looking one antibodies would likely test positive post vaccination.  think ok stretch bag course 6 pints? Dunno. Thanks South Dakota! tells retail employees fucked. Again. westerner talking empathy, quaint Apparently, they'll get first batch next week. &amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, found intriguing empirical correlation daily UVI COVID-19 infections UK, correlation coefficient −0.933 11 May 28 October 2020. process extending analysis countries regions. shall mention example Chile, Southern Hemisphere case. periods rise (25 March 6 June 2020) fall (7 June 28 October 2020) infections find anti-correlation ρ = −0.907 ρ = −0.730 respectively, accord anti-correlation found UK. Another important test would contrast countries environmental effects different lockdown policies, example Norway Sweden. note correlation two observables necessarily mean causation. UV light directly affects level infections could either reducing survival virus improving immunity people via production Vitamin-D possibly combination two. hand, UVI may indicate causes. example, low UVI may imply people spend time people indoors (e.g. home shops) suffer winter-time diseases, increasing chance infection. possible variables population density, temperature, humidity, air pollution geographical parameters. emphasise infection COVID-19 multi-parameter problem. indeed strong empirical evidence keeping social distancing wearing masks significant factors reducing transmission. also clear optimal solution infection would via vaccine. case advocate including impact UV modelling COVID-19 spread proposed medical protocols we'll see first responders at-risk folk handle vaccine well broad safety issue vaccine, kind risky roll broadly first responders first :/

That likely: we've tested 30,000+ people traditional phase 3 trial

It's unlikely 'risky.' remember watching videos him, chilled felt disappeared. Many us took seriously early probably owe lot. Government thanked plenty, guess. :(  people getting sick right people packed airports Thanksgiving. entirely brought themselves. 

Also, regular people won’t access vaccine year don’t get excited narcolepsy extreme rare cases? risk factors that? Borders lines map. I'm happy this. I'll rushing get vaccinated soon possible. OMG read shot could multi year protection vs nasal op said 6 months. don’t doubt works children often get flu vax nose. I’m saying shot IMO make much give many people possible. That's China though, gets approved FDA means safe moment yes. closed entirety November far surley closed till 20th December. sure discuss new measures soon. ""open"" June till October. 

Germany handled absolutely terrible anyways. single documented case someone spreading Covid theater. gyms restaurants. Yet schools. Literal Covid Hotspots open think essential. ask live theaters still open? WANNA UK DAY WAITTT long would immunity vaccine last? Last time checked think immunity someone infected covid around 3-6 months. hard time imagining protection vaccine would last longer. can’t herd immunity coronavirus without vaccine. It’s impossible. virus contagious. Herd immunity may high 88-93%. rate, you’ll never achieve without vaccine. time get near 80% first 20-25% got infected waning immunity susceptible re-infection again. Umm, vaccinated people still shed virus. Please wait get green light. wait... it’ll one eventually guarantee it! would believe that. tempting believe you’ve already hopefully type immunity inconvenience lockdown.

I think time December time January sicker I’d ever been...it crazy living today’s world would definitely checked temperature least called doctor. Different times...I lived life.

In reality probably flu bad cold. lot people know similar math. “Oh...now think it!” Maybe trying bargain away stress current situation. message clear. Every news station, website, scientist, doctor clear vaccines extremely limited available healthcare possibly vulnerable next months. It’s quite clear general public likely won’t able get vaccinated spring earliest. people hear want hear tune rest.  mention businesses comply 

It's true hypothetically, not? best interest keep staff getting ill keep operating effectively. seems role people's movement summer months warm weather underestimated factors role spreading virus. Genuinely, sort thing around top posts time  didn’t get doesn’t mean it’s moronic. Maybe you’re moron?? Even got vaccine tomorrow mean life turning around immediately anyways. would one option really - mass investment health systems they're capable dealing mass influx corona virus patients (for years come), also continue business usual treatments. 

We'd see overall average life expectancy reduce drastically, we'd see huge amount vulnerable people ages die, eventually we'd see way world accept it. 

As say, would incredibly dark we'll never really know bad could been. envision future vaccines within specific boundary conditions commercialized without massive slow clinical study. 

We eventually understand risks relatively low need vaccinate populations quickly prioritized pandemic, especially vaccines deployed hard hit areas.

That said, faster regulatory pathway changed much case since critical challenge manufacturing scale up. Lmao idk cdiff bad government literally said wrong too. dad kept saying it’s sweet considering government went back it. Intranasal vaccines valid useful tool, money grab. They've around years veterinary medicine preferred delivery method cases (less side effects, better protection). God hate elected feudal lords. got banned tifu 49ers couple others one. THATS surprising part Yup. “masks nothing” mess way CDC guidance school reopening seemed heavily swayed President executive branch. think people realise flu vaccine different one every year. It’s Thomas Keller’s restaurant. think? posted like 1 US. People sleeping. federal customer requires site. Jake Paul? sad watch American people provide clear case freedom bad thing -_- yeah, I'm glad bagofsocks said something, still joking right way, people wont take seriously Stop bullshit argument look practices countries also regularly spawn avian/swine flu variations lol imagine Canada trying flex US economically get asylum UK? Niiiiiiiice  *KA-POOOOOWWWWW!!!!!* Nice one MHRA! wonder stop people go protest outside offices (no idea why, got stuck offices years ago protest outside it) Yeah, saying someone. I’ve grown completely disillusioned wide swath America (and world, well). used argue explain certain things like masks distancing people, there’s use it. There’s much disinformation outright stupidity even give shit. explains thought election, must ""red map"" looking at.

What jackass. /r/MurderedByAOC Woah that's really cool *Zoom-enhance-zoom-enhance ...* Yep county screwed. point life living Canada huge positive you, either there's personal reasons yeah, really made lot bad decisions.

Canada much better protecting people fuck up. Otherwise, there's reason per capita people move Canada US US Canada. ""We've tried NOTHING we're ideas!!"" Oh yeah, don’t get wrong, think people certain bad cold COVID back January flu season ridiculous. see raw numbers coupled fact real case level likely 2-3 times what’s reported can’t help think “shoot, maybe get it” huge ""Covid hotspot"" new favorite name USA Right? can’t hide severity whilst time quarantine 750m people, obvious going many people west already began preparing Trudeau still steamrolling communities big oil steal land oil extraction deforestation. worry old man. 4 senior citizens vaccinated, safe even cough Triage 100% normal activity happens thousands thousands times day, should. mean think. merely setback?  Best place confederate flags tbh. Maybe vaccine mellow bit. going take it. Perhaps develop suppository version, cross fingers. eye ! never say thank experience. whole population mixes, though, thread makes sense me.

The disease spread easily nursing home half population vaccinated, sure. random 65 year old walking around unvaccinated receives exactly amount benefit 45 year old 35 year old fact 5% entire population vaccinated. still go church, still go supermarket, still see unvaccinated children, etc. Even 60% 65 year olds vaccinated, almost effect hypothetical 65 year old vaccinated. get disease risky activities, nothing ""herd immunity"" simply they're cautious. hand, they're exposed someone 65 disease, there's concept ""herd immunity"" among rest 65 year olds effect whether get sick. antibody test several months infection, may low detect. drop quickly within 3 months. body still tests sensitive America difficult like. many people, like least 50% absolute belief America best country world could barely fucking name 5 countries let alone show map. country almost global frame reference hear talk America. ask think America good... get answers like best economy best Healthcare, really frame reference. like free good country choose north Korea mentality. Thats sad. gf cancer. biopsy month ago. supposed get results biopsy within 2 weeks tops. It’s 4 weeks keep delaying hospitals labs absolutely overflowing COVID related tests work. 

Here Utah, we’re hovering 90% capacity last heard.

I haven’t social gathering since March I’m afraid infecting immuno compromised girlfriend. 

This shit much wider ranging effects people understand. I’m big time extrovert, I’m fucking slowly burning isolation fucks can’t put mask, I’m fucking done it. I’m honestly done it. sound like low concern stretch imagination FDA WYA feel like may knowingly aware someone know tested positive, likely know someone positive. Whether person never got tested share positive, particularly social climate adverse acknowledging virus threat poses. place work finding third wave violent strain? I’ve read, it’s possible virus mutated we’re going see sicker people higher fatality rate, sadly.  mean hotspot compared rest world...  “The vaccine made available across UK next week.""
 
Nice! Basically information ""leaked"" readily available anyone covidactnow Well shit Sherlock Even problematic - where's trained professionals? envision necessary massive influx dead bodies needing stored?

And vaccine delivery!

[lol, great, mental vision fleets Mr. Softee trucks criss-crossing country deliver vaccines ... ] [see Late party someone say it; could lose access n̶o̶r̶m̶a̶l̶ life. r/nottheonion actual timeline vaccine now? it? Message scientists healthcare experts pretty clear consistent. cos vaccine. ""new normal"" masks social distancing stay while. Neither polio measles immediately eradicated vaccines introduced. 

It's certain parties jumped gun declaring assuming vaccine,and folks listening science anyway... math off. There's roughly 138 million people aged 18-49 US. 0.05% = 0.0005, 0.0005 \* 138,000,000 = 69,000 people hospitalized. invades Middle Eastern countries oil

Stop repeating shitty, inaccurate memes. Even though America made stupid unethical choices Middle Eastern policy, accurate makes sound stupid. Yag. wonder many colleagues miss office. probably person miss seeing : ) I'm honestly pretty scared. 

My family, live with, went 20 person thanksgiving dinner Pennsylvania. one stayed home. said tested negative going....

I try wear mask around day, distance, eat separately; 2 days came back dad drive cardiologist I've chest pain shortness breath walking. Thankfully test came back normal spent multiple hours car dad, breathing air. blue cloth mask whole time. 

I could go somewhere else live time I've benzos chest pain (dr prescribed) trouble getting enough sleep getting benzos without experiencing ""withdrawal"" symptoms like racing heart, tremors, feeling like I'm sick get seizure. I'm scared happen I'm alone go really bad withdrawal. 

My mother doctor sees patients everyday office someone slip cracks. wears N95 mask equivalent. 

It's 3 days since came back far symptoms anyone. hope stays way. feel like I'm high risk sick ""I feel"" really want catch this. I'm otherwise young (20-25) ""healthy"" normal bloodwork except low vit D, functionally feel disabled sick get idea china hiding severity? else would think Moderna Cansino vaccines able get data start first vaccines final trial? want blame politics maybe blame democrats trying impeach Trump right end Febuary, Trump saying 15 cases 0 soon Easter. Totally Democrat hoax. virus disappear one day - 70 million Americans voted man said words One time drove something sharp got flat actually read original CNN report (which obviously haven't), conclusion literally opposite. literally said seems like China faced difficulties West evidence intentional lying.

In fact, numbers *were* publicly released, separated confirmed cases suspected cases. literally posting misinformation here. Hey, move Canada Mexico *almost* without touching hotspot customer today tell cases skyrocketing virus “dying out” isn’t real pandemic. believe people actually think like this.  conversations potential risks kids? Like, wanna something makes infertile (just hypothetical, really thinking could happen) cause unknown long-term risk messes developmental shit. I'm anti-vaxxer issues getting sooner rather later (though priority) sure kids absolutely knowledge subject far kids risks. 

What schools requiring it? currently require flu shot, could see requiring this. many parents USA working three 20 hour jobs week pay rent bills. 60 hours week full time benefits, time anything office hours, take child doctor year. Wha...? come from? it... cowboy user name? I’m actually uhh know... never mind. misinformation continue harm virus ever could. many parents USA working three 20 hour jobs week pay rent bills. 60 hours week full time benefits, time anything office hours. know three people personally killed this. One got psych ward. Mental health crises kill like covid does. Don’t belittle that. Capitalist America, poor renewable resource. fuel powerful burn warm pockets. ultra-super-low-temperature one sensors monitoring often they're opened, long, temperature abnormalities, auto-feed info back manufacturer. sure similar precautions vaccine. US allow Canadians entry via land. Air travel open. would expect military get own, own, probably much faster general public. They're expendable, saw early spread Navy. fight wars sick/dead people.

Prisoners....lmfao government give shit them. get 2022 I'll shocked. run course every prison they'll immune. 250, 000 deaths victory could much less Trump told truth public knew it. Instead, panicked, cowards do, kept lying. Saying would go away weather, would magically disappear... made fun people wearing masks. 

Trump’s lies directly responsible many, many deaths. Hello I’m Swedish you’re making up. approach grossly misinterpreted US it’s before, stricter recommendations put loosened depending region current outbreak. don’t lockdown encouraged stay home much possible lots restrictions/recommendations. 

I don’t know approach best, nobody’s yet there’s surely gonna things later established right call it’s true “Sweden absolutely regrets approach”. bet wearing flimsy cloth mask people around often wear none all

Exactly. Let's real, regular people can't afford medical grade N95 mask wear eye wear go out. go maybe 4 times months, that's parent's backyard. China poured concrete past 5 years US entirety 20th century.

We let powerful radio telescope world collapse due lack maintenance. 

The new San Francisco Bay Bridge built China.

We still modernized built high speed rail, despite countries like Morocco IRAQ, invaded less 20 years ago, that.

Half country still doesnt broadband internet.

Healthcare. Education. way expensive.

One could go one hours listing issues here. good one today posted TX Covid sub. Showing numbers matching. End summer??? Ummm another 9-10 months. Spring limit. I’m planning take vaccine right away don’t need arm twisted. I’m waiting return life afterwards. wasnt pushed quick. wrong answered months. need stop spreading lie whether meant even perspective, 97% Covid deaths 55 crowd. 

This entire thread exclusively talking effect Covid 40 crowd. Additionally 55 crowd represented traffic deaths (they drive slower). 

Do sums. 40's, mortality rate traffic accidents orders magnitude greater Covid.

Why trying make data fit argument? Surely trying fit argument data?

I fail see point (not) making. article. sobering read - medical conclusions understand totally broken public discourse become. sure going step away edge abyss. imagine guy February, probably gave me. Incoming:

I wOrK GrOcErY sToRe iMpOrTaNt 

This really good news though. ""I've still got time"" instinct gets every time. everyone loves estate sale! believe read body creates antibodies time, first dose going, second one becomes booster, think you’ll slow build protection time, probably starting 2 weeks first one. sat entire meeting. important understand meeting determines vaccine allocated one approved FDA.  


FYI: three sub-sections Phase 1 release. Phase 1a vaccinate health care personnel long term care facility residents staff. Phase 1b vaccinate ""essential workers"" education, food &amp; agriculture, utilities, Police, Firefighters, on. Phase 1c vaccinate adults high-risk medical conditions adults 65+.  


Also note, discussed sub-prioritization discussed prioritization within categories exception Long Term Care Facilities residents staff treated equally simply easier vaccinate everyone facility once. He's trying hard outdo 45 level cruelty state citizens. crime political humanly stupid. Yes, exactly. great way tell people surround really care people not. admit scared virus, man. clear post old people. reddit people debate whatever want ? really aggressive replies enjoy bullying others online ? tested anti bodies 10 months later , nothing. would love test long term cells. every symptom, tested negative flu told mysterious chest infection doctor. Forgot add federal government also gave 1 time stimulus cheque what, 6-9 months ago expecting guys live it? key factor guys fully locking get it. bills piling need feed family. federal government needed step pay guys stay home support families You’re right. heard today likely releasing January February right? Ever read Book Jeremiah?

Gods not, degeneracy never ended well people  need leaked government map tell us this?  hospital upstate NY expecting receive vaccine shipments middle Dec. Getting close!

Thank fucking god. would assume certain number days finish whatever doing. Lovely. I've already seen GOP chatter news reigning spending reducing bloated government. script flipped. matter long repeat Americans elect Trump 2.0 somewhat rural cost prohibitive. plan start ordering pickup groceries though.  short ""journey."" might help issues, amount shouldn’t cause harm. seems affect lot things besides immune system, bones, muscles, nerves. RDA probably miscalculated - recently shown research low factor 10. need like 6,000 units per day sources, 600.

Makes sense since need supplement 4,000 units/day get normal reading unless I’m working outside day every day.

How know you’re deficient? blood levels checked past month two? get actual number doc? Around 40-50 ng/mol aim for. 20 supposed lowest end healthy range, docs know want higher.

I’m fine maybe month per year late spring deficient rest time, supplement. 

That “15 minutes sun day” platitude entirely incorrect lot people, especially anyone higher latitudes darker skin, anybody doesn’t take time sun midday, really need blood test know aren’t low. see downvoters out.  Anyway, Florida done 12 million tests.  Positivity rate late looks like 7-8% rate.  last week reported 7.8%.  done 4.2 million tests.  Percent positive PCR ramped 5% around 12% 11% latest week, mid november, data provided.  data websites state even county departments health.   find quite interesting. agree they’ve working similar vaccine long time. don’t think messed sense efficacy. rushed sense haven’t studied long term effects - like 5 years road - increase cancer etc etc. JPEG picture virus. people care give someone else. also probably ppl get vaccinated. Elderly know happen get covid jump taking vaccine. Actually getting doses adminitored quickly possible important. course was. Wuhan major travel hub China. Thousands People travel China US. disease vast majority people experience minor symptoms stay radar while. China started notice problem probably began circulate US undetected. may able convince many Thansgiving get togethers Christmas even bigger deal Thanksgiving many. Also US Holiday either. New Years Eve bonus round too. end January, may fnally see peak peaks Pandemic things slowly getting better there. whole problem isn’t enough conviction thoughts prayers /s Illinoisian here. Many regions state abiding restrictions enforcing them. region, plenty restaurants open indoor dining capacity limits. Plus surrounding states little restrictions/enforcement. Don’t know you’re downvoted considering they’re unironically advocating death.  ER nurse know works small hospital Rockwall, Texas.... 120% capacity. knew someone kidney stones call around 5 different ER's find place could go to. interesting see happens 3 weeks. two-shot requirement may depress vaccinations communities.

Giving name &amp; contact info authority figure 2nd shot followup palatable undocumented. mention privacy paranoid general anti-government types. better worse thats missing point. citizens Governor South Dakota trying stop spread. going judge Governor would look economy fared trying help. Imagine America shut boarders Mexico they’re “different”. double standard real. it’s worth article 1 1,000 North Dakotans died COVID-19 consistent fever ""well"" all. fever days means body struggling fight virus, fucking good all. Sure, blip. cases trending downwards weeks now. last region get virus.

NY higher death rate countries world, starting trend upwards. That's far concerning dozen deaths tiny state. People die aspirin. People die life saving medication like epi pens. you’re going stab someone epi pen they’re attack there’s slight chance might die... they’re dying anyway. Picture way. COVID crap shoot. like gun fired randomly. Yeah, may get missed beginning, longer gun firing, better chance hit. bet post gets classed anti-vaxxing something ...all literally already plan for.

Uh.... what? please link state's vaccine roll-out plan? I'm super curious see far along are. 

Also- aware newfangled mRNA vaccines take two doses 1 month apart actual immune protection, right? it'd weather. like cold. could live southern US November March think I'd lot happier. Let’s ignore rest atrocities big pharma pressured give away vaccine solve global pandemic. 

You really low expectations order groceries delivered thing mask wearing consequences dont affect wearer case nonwearer, tremendous effect everyone around them. effin' POS Ive reading current vaccines wont released anyone younger 16 hasn’t testing. wonder thats going top play out. kids theaters, restaurants, anywhere? I'm Jim Jones approve message. McConnell shoots bipartisan $900 billion coronavirus stimulus plan stalemate drags  Pfizer Moderna vaccines two doses, 28 days apart. Agree you, calling someone spade roots racism. calling racist, term used. absolutely reason think way situation keeps getting worse.  anger issues. wish well life better currently causing mental instability  Thank God live US would never happen.

Me personally I'll probably take vaccine fucked immoral push people want it. people can't even basic precautions like wear mask, expect two needle injections couple month period? many lost employer-based coverage? yea... Rich people, lying politicians, maybe doctors, maybe boomers, everyone else. far states Republican Governor goes, state maybe Kentucky best intial response least. seems total moron. really smart still get fundamental things wrong that's focused interest. Hyperspecialization education double-edged sword, unfortunately. know bait hey good one. Includes $300 weekly specials unemployment 18 weeks retrospective 12/1 symptoms, get one oxygen meters asap. young without contributing condition fine. O2 numbers fall get medical help right away. Best wishes! Interesting, thank you!! Gotta get groceries dad work people's apartments. Oh, interesting. started taking vitamin hearing Fauci's thoughts subject little reading. admittedly, know nothing vitamin supplementation normally consume diet. I've doors since pandemic really gotten whole lot vitamin d. I'll look K2 Magnesium. Thank much sharing knowledge! PCR maybe? sure. results took almost 24 hours. one’s losing job government dictate. Nobody’s losing livelihood business.""

And could mask mandate conceivably that? fact, mandatory mask wearing would mean people alive spend money worked states done it?” said. “Has stopped outbreak Minnesota? Illinois? Michigan? New Jersey? states explosion cases?""

Because none States actually, seriously enforced mandates. \[states\] lock two three times lockdowns effective?”

Because none States actually, seriously enforced even vaccine, \[say\], ‘social distance 2022,’”

No don't. life decision worry refuse wear masks cough everywhere hard talk everything once. SD twice deaths NYC 1/10 population (and worst hospitalization rate per capita country noteworthy. really hate sound tinfoil hat but, y'all sure purpose murder family members guise COVID? super shady shit. 

I fully expect get negative doots btw. r/unpopularopinion people died Covid hospitalized first though. stay inside there’s risk getting NYC already infections numbers rising rapidly whereas dropping South Dakota. everyone touch facts? second Biden inaugurated script flip to, ""why Biden done stop this!"" instant. Calling rapid test pcr? negative pcr symptoms, probably ok, safe i'd avoid contact others another days monitor symptoms. could always wait couple additional months get one vaccines pipeline mRNA- Johnson Johnson one example. starting phase 3 trials now, aren’t far behind two front runners. end well FDA can't choose break law. law would changed, would probably take 14 days. didn’t say whether person allowed leave Ohio. said “literally nothing stopping” person leaving Ohio.

There plenty impediments, including financial resources. seems USA reaching 9/11 death levels combined movie Groundhog Day.  terrible many people country care enough fellow Americans try prevent happening. Medically eliminate coronavirus. Everyone knows this. Fauci others referring normal life without everything closed restricted certainly happen 2021 Yes, effects accident life...what's point? expect people get hurt playing basketball. expect accidents happen safety measures mention. difference COVID cases COVID happening staggering rate compared car accidents. 

There roughly 16,500 car accidents per day USA. major, minor. 180 - 200k case COVID per day reported right now. see difference? Furthermore, 2600 deaths reported COVID yesterday US. average 3200 auto-related deaths per day US. We're far off. negating real well-documented long-term side effects COVID. 

Most importantly, easy actions take prevent spread COVID. can't easily prevent someone making accident road. Things happen. miss car coming blind spot. go red light. happens. can't happen people reducing severity situation trying directly compare numbers match up.

My whole point pretty well fucking understand car accidents. understand COVID people getting infected dying shocking rates. care affects. Trying downplay severity showing disproportionate deaths age ranges really disgusting. situation impact prevent. opposite.

So yes, agree disagree also still call actions dangerous negatively affecting attempts solving situation chance solving. airline employee gets sick, almost certainly recover couple weeks most. airline employee loses job company bleeding money hosting fewer less crowded flights, employee almost certainly go broke encounter fate far worse illness. scenario sounds like company cares employees?  don’t see difference two things? Traveling contained car highly infectious virus. 

You’re also greatly ignoring huge number traffic laws enforcement - including requirement tested get license drive. What's same, see article UK. Somebody’s gotta go last might well prisoners.  virtually cause safety concerns mRNA vaccines individuals zeroed importance interferon responses action mRNA vaccines raised questions autoimmunity. fact matter interferons represent extremely effective ubiquitous mechanism deal viral infection while aberrant interferon signaling play role autoimmune diseases one hold context: virtually every viral infection encounter going elicit production interferons. evolved deal viruses. somehow find position brink autoimmune disease that’s needed interferon kick gear (and way knowing individuals are) **the reality avoiding mRNA vaccine going essentially nothing modify risk developing autoimmune disease**. bound develop infection point produce interferons.  Imagine flying pandemic. Finally! hope everything control start investigate China irresponsible Yes, true. tell cigarettes bad I'm smoking cigarette make less bad you. Politicians flaunting covid rules mean should. Since vaccine requires two doses 2nd dose around 3-4 weeks 1st, vaccines given people instead saving shots people? instance 10 million doses given 10 million people (1 shot each, manufacture waiting period) instead 5 million (1 shot each, 1 shot reserved waiting period). I'm sorry forgot mention words economy, capitalism stonks. understand post. /s Hahaha experts ones saying this. full football stadium outside equate normal life. many experts suggest recovery going take years. really. 9/11 cold blooded murder. illness. scientist (not medical biological sciences) can't help fully agree one. remarkable. Nope argument. Please try again. Ice Oxygen seems like eternity now. reruns Cold Blood, guy practically syndicated. CDC recommending test one three days travel another three five days travel, plus reducing nonessential activities seven days travel, Walke said. get tested reduce nonessential activities 10 days travel, agency said.

They really explicit ""non essential activities"" means. Far vague seriousness situation. Everything listed optional. one needs go live event needs vacation.

I'm pretty sure 100% Americans ""afford"" go concert, football game, vacation. Maybe full cardboard cutouts people. living, breathing people? Personally, doubt it. many say get vaccine. able tell boss remain work possible might superspreader week entire workforce might hospitalized. 

Is risk willing take? one put regardless many us immune. one, mean one, live way ‘well 2022’. happened Maryland. restrictive gun laws there. meant said ‘drain swamp’? Yeah living rural right great, city people always city people. highly doubt covid going undue history humanity, flocking urban centers.

If black plague stop it, would covid? imagine end 2022, people going back cities. Thnk they're meeting 12th something long best part going karaoke bar chillaxing airport terminal boarding plane. I'm looking forward 2021 gradually return pre-pandemic lifestyles. Damn, really gotta make trip week popeyes. Need chicken sandwich 😩 performance Monday night deserved full stadium 60k fans booing field. Ok, optimistic I've heard Fauci while. really hope premature judgement, ""experts"" predict return pre-pandemic normalcy 2024, Stadiums full 2021, returned normal then? mean? ... no. 24 194 countries World? 

Is seriously argument? 

That must lowest bar Sweden ever tried jump. Yeah BLM protests partying streets. Oh wait... oh yeah, probably know true numbers till around friday next week backlog done catch up, thanksgiving surge. course be, three vaccines now. Wonderful! I’m literally group would potentially affected course care more.

You're greater risk ADE anyone else.

You're worrying bugaboo access data none us yet.

Not really, they're reading papers published past 11 months training read them, understanding know ADE going happen alarm bell would gone now. It’s coincidence. heard reliable way make numbers drop go shopping. Strange, thought already know kill covid, that's disinfectant spray wipes like lysol close eyes focus breathing. Steady breaths. Mentally reminding pain I'll fine soon. Works really well me. I've TON shots IVs though I'm kind used it. astonishing? Looks like things important others, eh? vaccine vaccine. science works.

It exactly science works. Bad research published time. result almost certainly wrong exact reasons listed: false positive due cross-reactivity coronaviruses. known issue serology study.

In contrast, samples patients influenza-like illness rescreened SARS-CoV-2 RNA none found earlier mid-January.  Okay lot restaurants closing good. happens people. There's enough jobs everyone i'm trying say. luckily people jobs go back lot cause pandemic. Look positive view. job go others going hard time looking work. Excuse stupid question, would still get vaccine even allready antibodies? BC seem dissapear while, right? know need jabs amount time? know myth inject small doses virus, still; antibodies act same? call Pfizer vaccine BioNTech vaccine ones actually smarts develop it? thought 'wealthy elite'? would take 'PoIsOn VaCcInE' Bill gates's microchips it? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  doesn’t fit. they're precipice overwhelmed. Always.

If one precipice change course, logical outcome? seeing reports quite now, change behavior much, yet, still overcrowded hospitals bodies floor.  media crying wolf? Aslong get vaccine approved month even early January rolled early January make much difference. actions hit news feed, authorities pretty choice either. charges likely dropped later, given token fine. one wants arrest people give tickets. want people comply orders stop spreading virus. vaccination renders immune, point, prevents getting infected first place.

Please go read vaccines worked on. clearly think like flu vaccine.

Ending conversation now. fun please go read dude. spreading misinformation obviously unaware. able leave work right telling boss covid mom came Thanksgiving? look like use abuse drugs? need 100% sure cause need job. wasn’t aware still task force. Grab piece paper towel use touch handles principal transmission vector aerosols caught covid back October finally tested negative 4 weeks initial test. days ago around friend didn’t know contracted covid (was asymptomatic) finally got positive result yesterday. weren’t wearing masks saw other. need get re-tested again/quarantine even though got catching covid myself? 40, need assume became infected Thanksgiving period gathered beyond immediate household. likely, symptoms...""

Is research suggesting people 40 asymptomatic? that's statement makes sounds like, I'm seeing anything directly supports that. catholic church opposed rejected heliocentrism.

From 1616, the Catholic Church issued prohibition Copernican theory earth’s motion. led later (1633) Inquisition trial condemnation Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) suspected heretic, generated controversy continues day. rushed. That's disinformation, fallen for, spreading. Read info that's inaccurate statement. New York reports nearly 9,000 new coronavirus cases, biggest one-day increase since April

- New cases: 8,973
- Positivity rate: 4.6% (-0.4)
- hospital: 3,924 (+150)

My absolute favorite thing right board gaming. play partner tons games play solo! favorite right called *Horrified* (solo option) ""fight"" classic Universal Monsters. Think Frankenstein, Invisible man, Mummy more. super fun sometimes games super close every move counts. boardgame sub ton options solo games well. seen many games play completely different number players have. pretty cool want able play others (if ever safe). 

The best part hobbies cheap expensive want. stay cheap want try little everything. 

Honestly I've home last 10 years gone lot different hobbies also got try things would never even thought before. see jack trades master none lol. 

Regards finding new friends online, sooo hard! met ton people IG lately obviously that's everyone suuppper inconsistant. know theres sub called make friends know popular is. wish Bumble like sub find friends online instead IRL. 

I hope gave ideas! DM anytime ask questions it. DM shoot shit, will. I'll never complain trying make new friends! going hospital workers first. widely publicized point regular people getting vaccines Spring Essential workers essential function. Nursing home residents already shipped families didn’t want deal them. 

The workers absolutely get vaccine first. say they're better UK. Apart say Germany guess ither EU countries France, Spain, Italy really bad second waves deaths per capita par UK. many expected distributed UK end year? (I know US March/April)? type news (good bad)...

Well, plastered every news outlet today. probably right though. 

And great news work long term care facilities. ...of bodies /monkeypaw I'm high risk according schedule offered around January, time see might affect people.

My main concerns mRNA vaccine might interact pre existing medical conditions zero information there.

My local hospital also said 'get stocks last' worry get right away getting places require proof vaccine, look good able go back queue while. including disposing masks, abolishing social distancing taking plastic barriers/tape? Lawsuits passengers? treatment, genius. means virus first place use it. advocating allow virus spread like wild fire treat severe cases would flood hospitals need therapy.

A vaccination renders immune, point, prevents getting infected first place.

If vaccine grants immunity virus cannot become infected first place spread it. can't immune infection still spread virus.

No wonder debt pretending play stock market Reddit. agree need stagger doses. thing tgat worries (like many things year), good informational messaging there. mean, *we're* aware stuff, *very* strongly suspect significant amount people think (or think):

\- need one shot 

\- worst side effect slightly sore arm

\- they're aware side effects, backlash like get flu shot (""Oh, bother - got shot still got it""!)

\- think ""got it"", like side effects, they're conveniently busy ""forgot"" - bunch people never get second shot, one really confers protection.

Other things I'm sure we'll see:

\- people think they're immune immediately getting shot.

\- people think (current) vaccines mean can't get can't spread virus. [Research two candidates show reduction severe symptoms, *possibly* reduction deaths.]

In short, strongly believe enough messaging going vaccines that, again, therefore easy stupid people, malicious governments, power-hungry individuals manipulate messaging (and people), damage response pandemic cohesion society.

And would love believe I'm paranoid, really think am. :( Yes true. It’s live vaccine. concerned DHEC told quarentine 10 days symptoms started, already day 8 still coughing phone DHEC lady. stayed inside full 14 days, went groceries. Yes, lost job crisis, lazy, weak, stupid. mental case are. Get help, honestly. pandemic really challenging expecting everyone scared hysterical unhealthy said ""something"" reference method transmission, rather actual virus itself. another edgy teenager getting triggered common expression...also science nothing, scientists did. scientists also religious people statement doesn’t even logically make sense. MIL question. FIL volunteer firefighter could get vaccine early, 63yo, quit school job, comorbidities, would later group healthy adults would firestation give one too? get vaccines free station spouse, there's reason believe station could get hands extra vaccines spouses would get them. 

I agree though, there's reason believe time household members initial groups also receive vaccine. supply yet ""extras"". worth, essential worker house vaccinated would probably, least small degree, improve safety outcomes household members. Im going lose sleep this. temporary pregnancy condition basically means pay nose get decent life insurance even though went back normal afterwards. going let bilk me, life insurance me. One needs life insurance survive. Deliveries can't avoided. Thats items like food.

They already punished courts. punishment include isolation add unnecessarily punishment people like view less others.

You almost 0% new infections. still risk group new inmates time. also literally nothing back statements. things blatantly made up. 

We need elect carefully. risk groups higher average rates infection death, like incarcerated individuals priority. So... haven’t spent decade watching effects doesn’t mean can’t adequately predict won’t long term effects. fully understand mechanism vaccine. fully understand mRNA works interacts cells. We’ve also enough time clinical trials see concerning effects, would happened days months administration, aren’t happening. top that, immediate well long term risks COVID-19 far outweigh hypothetical risks vaccine which, far best minds world able determine, don’t exist. mean, economically hurt, right. US GDP still around 10× Australia's, population (not discount lives lost, lot people). good news indeed. dead US yesterday. 4 months ago said folks needed wash hands measures 270k dead US died severe COVID 19. 

Not sure it. yes, people would listen social distancing, wear masks, wash hands. US would like CA.

But guys anti mask parades. Im going end note. Greece hit hard spring. That’s factor. spoke infectious disease doctor state's task force day - expects realistically phase 2, general public availability, would summer - hopefully school. Phase 1 would roll (in order): frontline healthcare workers, 1st responders/police/firefighters, essential workers, high risk/nursing home patients.

Can always sooner awesome. Easiest way offer sources -- want share info people, cite others also evaluate it! is, seems either reading poor-quality sources misinterpreting researchers MDs saying.  plane train October? He's doctor?

His critical thinking skills affected long covid.

Let lesson never place something important two hands. Oxford/AZ vaccine test adults 55. 

Only half+full dose study include 55. larger full+full dose study did, found safe easily tolerated older volunteers. know you, I've doctor numerous times they've tested strep flu. neither, throw hands say virus follow usual home remedies. Hospitalizations covid pretty rare, I'm surprised took couple months really start looking cases. PS5 scalpers? won’t spread virus nearly well though. Someone who’s asymptomatic 2 days immune system stomps virus isn’t nearly risk someone who‘a asymptomatic 10 days, symptomatic spewing snot lung bits another week, is.

There perfect absolute science, everything asymptote wary rushed vaccine, whose long term effects may manifest years any, ""not right thing"". know particular post, recall someone past talking process would expedited many studies going time demanded FDA attention attention scientists themselves. covid-19 research basically moved front line many studies halted true getting paid take test eneded postive incentive testing?I remember proposed actually happen? That's simply true. COVID results high prevalence organ damage especially lungs, among kinds patients, asymptomatic symptomatic, young old, vulnerable healthy. evidenced studies repeatedly, beginning least early cruise ship incidents months ago.

COVID also related crippling long-term disabilities chronic fatigue, affect young healthy patients admittedly rarely organ damage. get information clearly isn’t true I’m sure Contagion-esque film 5-10 years line, probably documentary shit certain government’s response like inside. reddit likes pretend like US worst place ever was. *cries America* Hospitals get oxygen delivered tanker trucks refrigerated liquid bulk tanks outside building. 

It’s generated site, would tremendously impractical. portable concentrators used home low flow rates, takes large industrial facilities heavy machinery generate significant quantities liquified oxygen bulk use hospitals. believe provided absolutely zero evidence support last. know get well. fact heard household members also get it. bet fun parties verbatim call stupid, come on, original comment kinda implied proof around us deep state hoax

People believe COVID outright exist. believe threat overblown numbers manipulated make look worse justify power grab. way Patriot Act passed kinda makes slightly rational fear.  far... Let's say 25% people good matter what, 25% people bad matter what. 50% swayed. acting irresponsibly likely 75% population responsible 25%. 

This issue people's parts. also societal issue healthcare services overwhelmed, situation perpetually bad economy services can't open, etc. doubt I’m ever going stop wearing one public. I’m happy it. cuts smelling people’s awful fragrances odors affords protection germ cloud gross old man Home Depot coughing straight air. mean google maps? Cool thanks think feel bad frustrated experience better. Obviously NY/NJ got screwed among first population density.

Does make want go slap people ignoring risks now? saying can't things differently wearing masks.... seems suicidal many us. that's true, wait pissed second string player rat out.

If ever reason recreate smu punishment would vaccine free US. But, yes, let's continue making US worst possible place world. Die ignorance, then. freezers complicated build someone need invest money production lane would market next year. money problem could scale vaccine production lines too. Covid: WANT BAMA!  There's probably many young people severe complications think. live going prioritize 65 younger adults TWO qualifying conditions going anyone younger even kind condition impacts covid seriousness. That's actually rest world views it. ""A team researchers Brigham Young University suspected scientific community dismissed alcohol-free sanitizers quickly. 

To test hypothesis, tried several alternatives. One contained benzalkonium chloride, common ingredient existing alcohol-free hand sanitizers. others tested also based so-called 'quaternary ammonium' compounds (Quats), commonly found disinfectants.

They discovered alcohol-free sanitizers tested killed 99.9% virus more, fifteen seconds less.

'We conclude Quats rapidly inactivate SARS-CoV-2, making potentially useful controlling SARS-CoV-2 spread hospitals community,' researchers write."" live st lucie county I’m glad people wear mask (where shop anyway) shop WAWA almost exclusively. Everyone wears mask. Went circle k one mask. What’s lockdown situation Texas? assumed would lax I’ve heard they’ve taking measures Curious side effects plan rolling out. Sounds like one bad day (fever, aches, etc) taking it. guess would given shifts everyone once? Woooo industry finally come back! That's fun rant vaccine free US, case since March like enjoy afraid Scared? word you’re looking BRAINWASHED shared soon apparently, shared phase 1/2 WHO. Given amount people received this, data. Agree, used quite common US superspreader something ever want hear relation swingers? I'm surprised this, amount people believe claim fear mongering propaganda alarmingly high. Think viruses got 🤣 ""mind control"". coercion take something they're wary about. stupid, much may like think are. fact ""crazy anti vaxxers"" ones wary this; many people date flu shots others, included, also concerned. Listen, woke up, upvoted it, ok? Sheesh. I’m American care countries too. US soon follow. “Embers” press secretary likes say. get vulnerable populations start wiping out? certainly would anomaly, even flu season. less vulnerable time. without knowledge, precautions stop spread would taken place. guess lag time, like...I dunno. still get happen. People seem understand ""full capacity"" means. 

It means room nothing else. definition impossible sustain. said funding distribute it. DeWine trying get Congress pass another relief bill. getting covid test $300? places drive testing (CVS/Walgreens/etc.) close college? Yeah would trust data though? NOOO AMERICA BAD UPDOOTS!!! blatantly false misguided. hell give callous advice, ducking god.

OP, research already Covid around Covid people don’t listen shitheads comment things nothing like roemme. comments EU officials seen context UK officials claiming sort Brexit victory. EMA also getting bit heat process taking longer MHRA work regulations.

The vaccine safe looking data another 2-3 weeks going change that. big baby are. Mask hurt big boy feelings? Grow up. Gonna save click: infects equines species. Central Georgia “Cov-hwhat?” hit 2021. without vaccine. feeling long time - winter move us close herd immunity. widespread infections way stop full partial lockdowns, happen Feb (or all). Thank much, edited sources. lots more. yeah like 1 Wear good mask. one, make sure whatever wearing least 3 layers fabric, sort safe filter material lying around use too, make sure mask tight (obviously tight hurt) face allow air edges. wear glasses, people real worried wear goggles.

I spend half day urgent care city peaked July, could hear lady room next coughing lung, still ok (though *her* room her, knows). also asked wait car till could see sit waiting room. Also made sure take shower wash clothes soon got home.

The people work doctor's office manage stave off, one visit. vaccines already free US stuff nightmares I've staunch secessionist long time pandemic election support point even now. get symptoms vaccine, none ones tested US use actual coronavirus, there's risk transmitting anything. Correct, trump actually pat back talking DPA. Exactly! imagine virus like HIV Coronavirus-like transmission. God busy giving us science ability manufacture products need stop spread. Leave alone!

73 million. Leaked Vatican documents show pope still Catholic. sir selfish asshole. know already though. worn mask past flu seasons? Hundreds healthy kids die every year. Yeah, though (at least Aus) started making [Oxford-AstraZeneca last week Melbourne going months rollout numbers - providing trials passed.

Then again, guess wait it. anyone believes mind control, probably need professional help “understanding position”. Pathology  another incredibly uninformed (and untrue) take. really rolling. Yeah I’m confused AFAIK feasible way fall. think Fauci conservative one addresses public manage expectations “just case” kinda way. course cases going back up. one social distancing tbh feel california pandemic. Everyone about. Please please Sweden authorize want grandparents sick :'( anyone know vaccine efficacy vaccine? Heh, surprising. reaction typical.. needle hits skin, mask comes vaccines magic. 

2021 gonna much wiser 2020. cannot allow vaccine gap! Napa far SF know. know UK gets blood supply? people younger 25 donate get abroad?

Also elderly desperate need blood, chances developing dying MC pretty small. shall say would take chance, surgery table bleeding out. Thank you, edited. I’m pretty sure already knew without map 😂 It’s surprising there’s one replies far. Sorry, US leadership provided much misinformation bad info longer expect population adhere protocols significant numbers need to.

Christmas super-spreader event year, guaranteed. Regardless lockdown not. misplaced fears

The fears people quite rational. example, speed developed approved, insight potential long term effects may manifest years line. Think swine flu vaccine narcolepsy. 

And people's fears ""misinformed"" ""misplaced"", address them? They're scared. honestly, I'm scared future ever back March; sets dangerous unbound freedom put lives risk.

Ok, let's ban everything could possibly kill anyone, right? motor vehicles, substances including foods might trace amounts mild carcinogens, flying, swimming, leaving house stairs case fall them. Let's ban kill people too. See stupid sounds? Life carries risk, can't continue cowering houses virus whose symptoms mild vast majority people. knew this, everyone, world warned world literally 2020, lol Please point called stupid? Actually pretty intelligent I'm baffled willful ignorance complete denial proof around us deep state hoax. think lot people sub living extreme fear see vaccine silver bullet end pandemic. doubt many would still take vaccine knowing terrible consequences.

One thing worries Pfizer vaccine we'll still able become infected, we'll minor symptoms. There's chance people still able spread stage, I'm assuming bad. know put children trials Oxford/AZ vaccine test adults 55. *This, bucket* Evolution take care stupidity. Stop talking people start proposing solutions **what helpful anyone**. likely happen. I’m anti - vaxxer, like getting them. Right I’m 50 / 50 one. Realistically though, won’t worry another year , they’re available us, much analysis transpired. prisons jail inmates?

These close living facilities folks regularly released community serving sentence awaiting trial.

They often little resources access type health care. Hope lungs ok. Go ahead tell number people died US far Covid. Well, whole point studies find rates things happen *don't* necessarily notice begin - stuff happens people never initially need hospitalised, cause obvious complications initial treatment COVID, get picked regular statistics.

For instance, got heart lung damage asymptomatic mild bout COVID, might notice go hospital related issue years later. point studies specifically checked kind thing, found fairly high prevalence. I'm honestly point of.....

Don't want get vaccine? care. can't bother care. sure would help everyone did. die. Oh well. chance. 

I can't waste time, energy, mental health trying convince anyone get refuses.

Yes. understand means keeps chances higher even people get vaccine getting covid. ZERO it. get impeach like policy.

You literally do. That's entire point impeachment. Otherwise would arrest politicians charge formal court law. 

You probably go learn impeachment instead taking individual wiki statements context. Also ignoring word 'equivalent'. think might pronouncing historic incorrectly... promise assume supreme leadership planet earth everyone’s gonna wear mask time. wonder legal liability. following standards claim, kid catches family member dies long term disability. would seem like lawyer's dream. Children, part, seem asymptomatic. know getting tested. bring home older family members though people need get tested. everyone house got it, tested adults. daughter ""presumed positive"" quarantine longer us. L work hospital system Illinois flu shot mandatory. understanding mandated state health department hospital workers. think exemption allergy, may also religious exemption. clear, think reuters low quality information thanks OP sharing it. I'm riling new policy seems get numbers analysis media official sources. would be. Anti maskers love guy reason. know what’s even important that? financial safety net help people businesses directly impacted public health policies.  mean Illinois getting damn close hitting safety measures place. It’s simple unfortunately  plan everyone UK vaccinated April. sure, months away, still pretty soon. possible get COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer Moderna vaccines use gene virus vaccines studied use inactivated virus. None cause COVID-19. Even live vaccines risk viral shedding low none current major contenders even live vaccine argument moot. Lmao Hello, Im Turk living Turkey appearently get vaccines China thats called Sinovac. would happily get vaccinated Pfizer, Moderna Oxford's vaccine doubts China's vaccine couldnt find source. do? Also, vaccine developed sars mers ended producing faulty antibodies made vaccine participants (animals) sick exposed sars vaccination.

You know done vaccines right? animal studies. read them. ADE detected realize Illinois worst state midwest deaths per capita, last 7 days entire year.  keep reading countries like Poland Mexico I’m almost certain worse US. introvert I’m dying go out. love socializing :/ introvert doesn’t mean antisocial.

For true introverts socializing exhausting look social gathering opportunities. extreme introverts avoid them.

While may enjoy alone time shy, seek actively enjoy unnecessary socializing may introvert get they're trying keep variant original version journalistic integrity something, way handled notes annotations little bizarre. they're willing edit original clarify Neeleman current CEO JetBlue, fact ""absurdity statistical argument"" absurd relegated footnote?

But fact SA willing publish apparently without even reading Buzzfeed article refers really reflects poorly them. total number people recovered COVID-19 without vaccine 10x number people died COVID-19. I'd love map country! too, moreso report actually useful information included well. 

In comparison reuters ""article"" looks like garbage post opinion. they're BRAINWASHED. think people got sick year ago got worse strain. Talking people got much sicker people talk now. commenter gave facts CDC nothing I'm gonna waste time. Keep fear mongering millions people get lives ruined That’s gotta extra tough extrovert. conflating multiple conspiracy theories wary new vaccine concerns rushed research, unknown side effects etc one thing.

This majority people take vaccine concerned about. see lower expected amount people saying they're gonna take believing governments nations worldwide faking pandemic nebulous New World Order headed bunch billionaire supervillians want inject mind control microchips general population steal elections overthrow US government whole train thought

Let's look bit nebulous New World Order headed bunch billionaire supervillians

Have read ""new world order"" people terrified real mind control microchips

It might worth mentioning author aforementioned document [pushed steal elections overthrow US government

This ignore. People throw mix fail realise happening beyond borders United States. embraces beliefs willfully ignorant

Read linked see still believe this.

Again, people scared, stupid. read things like linked coming likes world economic forum, think they've got pretty good reasons wary. taking long distribute lol like start giving Makes exceedingly angry US done same, yet problem one cares anymore. It’s “healthcare workers problem” “ours” republicans idiots BS, Republicans happy follow curfew riots. Republicans they're told leadership. problem leadership opposed science. stats source please? 

I know loads people tested positive they're fine anecdotes helpful.  longer people say alive, longer government get taxes them. many LTCs NYC Realize macro level limit travel much possible, micro level likely fine. overwhelming majority people Covid, quite unlikely brother girlfriend come see you. real question fuck tax payer funded map leaked?



Hypocritical agent orange sheep want everyone take personal responsibility? Well give us facts. Quit lying ""don't panic""!



And yes hypocrites got bent shape thinking Nashville hiding tax payer funded data order close bars months ago. even FOX retract Astoria good testing? That's disappointing. like Idaho that's surprise special knowledge would surprised events required vaccination made exception, since would way knowing vaccinated not. Paywall bs I'd share FB relatives would call fajes news cause anything CNN labeled fake🙄 going feel good see people smile happy together I'll believe receive pay. wonder airlines/airports temp checks something one two geniuses went “oh YeAh KnOw hOaX” blows. Damn Interesting. Seems like you’d wanna put restrictions place based cases rather hospitalisations - feel like latter lag Also, American. read news frame global scale. Unless close borders, getting 60 70% immunity isn’t greatly effective people refuse continuing wear face masks social distancing. 
But want reiterate: celebrating today vaccine got approved (and soon elsewhere) Alright tin-can-man you’ve drinking ole Kool Aid. 266,000 dead sound ya? 

The great reset? Lol lost may find way. wear damn mask. isn't. Getting downvoted hivemind r/Coronavirus, seems. something say ""Leaked"". Plaster shit everywhere! Everyone needs know. going say “lucky them” but, case, hard work get rewarded. friends without health insurance pay anywhere $125-$200 tests. part, legit mansions there. friend delivers he’s place sent insane pictures peoples shit there.

 yeah, tons fake rich people well. God hate Rockwall. agree, family friends get vaccinated effective. fact vaccines imminent, people saying they're years bit dramatic. vaccines even close ready, could see hesitation reluctance. keep along, masks, social distancing hand washing, etc, we'll woods know it. I’m introvert I’m dying go out. love socializing :/ introvert doesn’t mean antisocial. problem idiot conspiracies came POTUS. hospital even close fully staffed precovid. dangerously understaffed 100% capacity. Best luck people waiting room. great news! Imma still wait replication consensus tho Also would say gross generalization. live college town. Kids wear masks porch outside. Hell I’ve heard kids getting kicked friend groups spotted mask. sure areas may true. definitely colleges second thought using period European way mean 8 thousand three hundred twenty three. Sadly, Yep! sentiments exactly. 

If keeps family getting sick. Fuck idiots won’t take it. Controversial opinion: 

If hesitant getting vaccine “long term side effects”, you’re better people think Bill Gates trying microchip them. see people internet saying wait months even years taking it. Even Fauci urging people take it, people look like God (I lmao) sudden turn full 180 him. 

These people becoming science deniers vehemently despise. jail time necessary, deny medical access. care anyone else, fuck them. People short memory... I'm legit nervous second dose. probably end miss another 2-3 days work again.

Looking local health department documents, looks like health department closely monitoring contacting people second dose. need hounding people come get second dose giving lots education reassurance.

The government pass law prohibits employers taking corrective action employee calling work covid like symptoms. could make vaccine specific concern abuse. Essentially get vaccine, can't punished showing work 2 days following vaccination. make lot people willing get jabs.

Someone else jokingly mentioned tying sort compensation second dose. said get stimulus check show second dose, happen. sort incentive may bad idea.

In beginning, probably issue. early adopters mostly Healthcare workers understand happening expect side effects. Also, early adopters likely way concerned covid less concerned vaccine reaction. weird read ""the beginning end"" optimistic way... get ya. exciting, looking forward able get it. Areas Concern Continuum

*Looks map*

That's everywhere!  like three little pigs cartoon. straw sticks pigs dancing around fun playing instruments, making fun pig still building brick house. ""Who's afraid big bad wolf?? laugh play day"" Yea, don’t get stopped allowing posts. 

I came sub mostly get number updates countries/states it’s gone end scrolling posts I’ve already seen various News subs news apps...

Thank keeping though! new deaths added total today one previously reported uncertain date clarified (so 23 uncertain date deaths now). One death added 8/11 rest 11/11 1/12. Regions 5 newly reported deaths today are: Stockholm +52, Skåne +31, Västra Götaland +27, Västmanland +11, Uppsala +10, Östergötland +10, Gävleborg +9, Jöngköping +8, Örebro +5. age groups distribution +1 20-29, +2 40-49, +2 50-59, +11 60-69, +37 70-79, +76 80-89 +45 90+.  today's update week 47 jumped average 34 deaths/day 43 deaths/day week 48 31/day even though quite incomplete yet.

That's giant increase reported deaths Sweden. getting better. guess death rate numbers hospital dropped. Even everyone 50 vaccinated they'll want wait bit hospital numbers go down.

Relaxing restrictions cause hospital numbers go up. hopefully enough people vaccinated go much. Wow, imagine people flew positive get caught. article...

“Since early pandemic, data company SafeGraph tracking something calls Shelter Place Index. company collects anonymized data cell phone movements. index basically measurement much population staying home day relative pre-pandemic baseline.

No, people actually think microchips actually control mind vaccines Rates long covid anywhere 20%-80% people get mild Covid case, depending flavor pessimism sub feeling time lol Yeah fake rich though, making 100k acting like millionaires. baffling. Mine free Illinois mask keep windows open. goal prevent additional viral dose. Oxygen levels measured throughout day everybody. Happy Hypoxia sneak her.

 [The mystery pandemic's ‘happy hypoxia’ | Science yep,
I thought solid move editors led information,(right front), corrected it, re-published it. 

Its worth continued read.  Yep, used fun work sometimes, going lunch, relaxing bit coworkers coffee room. work work meeting meeting meeting. ego truly amazing ability deceive mind. understand expression is, right?

Nevermind “thank science” deifies science. really want smarmy atheist (it’s ok, go it, we’re young newly religion feel like something prove), thank *scientists*.

Because science process understanding way things work, might well saying “thank logic” even “thank reality”. anti-USA circlejerk

You mean ""anti team"" hes right though. someone went somewhere mean covid. would saying ""everyone went work today must assume covid"" Fauci also doesn’t tell whether go life normal.’I currently choosing distance take precaution. don’t need prepare anything. covid “lifestyle” done long someone willingly takes part. I’m vaccinated, compulsive purelling, masked walks, distancing friends relatives...is done. I’ll also happily get airplane. tried that. wound slavery That's attract americans, american, americans come. 'greatest country Earth' star spangled banner tattooed dick, people tend stay away.

Tell life like 1877. hasn’t case anymore. descent negative test. today kauai asking 14 day quarantine agree wrote. take blurb mask use. Anti-mask factions occurred Spanish flu well. think Americans, general, change much. again, Donald Trump like administration either (hopefully). personally believe enough bit damage person President. world, mainly first world (and second world) countries, fine otherwise.  UK also gets dibs first batch way. risky payout could huge. Stop killing people selfishness. frustrates much many people still pitching temper tantrums wearing mask. Maybe know anything, 90% effective rate good enough approval? measles 15. sub tendency bals accept non-US/UK/EU countries well modern sciences ever since sub blew up.  hope descendants learn mistakes fuck royally like Covid. Ummm Fauci telling everyone March wear masks. think you’ve forgotten that. 

And, newsflash, finding covid antibodies America 2019. virus everywhere. 

This notion could ended two weeks ridiculous it’s almost funny. Right? Fuck keeping job thoughout working 12 hours day make things happen people COULD GONE BACK WORK collecting $600 week. soon borders open implies they're open people who've gotten vaccine. Aka I'd get vaccine going. asshole sake it. Half sub doesn’t want things return normal. christmas break 700 little sauce please? Thank Science anyone life believes anything different ever hear G-word. 100% correct sad.  Sorry! Yea I’m really getting tired hearing Trumps name point. really nothing face hate. lot moving parts failed it’s disingenuous simplifying “fuck Trump”. - I’m sure that, like vaccine, people *can’t* get vaccinated (due allergies vaccine components, history severe reactions, immune system problems, etc), medical exemptions definitely going thing. I’m sure coordinators trial would able provide letter/some sort documentation could submit. sad term ""embrace"" even needs said. Thanksgiving break, Keystone great job making sure folks masked separated lift lines. also understood didn’t want share lift others. someone within 6 ft going slope, I’m taking evasive action normal season. That’s factually accurate. moral fact killing hundreds thousands absolute worst way build immunity irrelevant mathematical fact people immunity (either fully antibody partially t-cell memory) means lower rate spread.  wife similar situation. require students wear masks times building, eating drinking whatsoever. wears mask face shield. limit number students. also screen students door blatant covid symptoms. Anyone symptoms sent home given permission make class later date. learn someone class covid, cancel in-person class, notify students, quarantines gets tested. 

I feel like they’re everything do, short online impossible training requires in-person lab component. moved lectures online, though, students part course. 

I don’t know kind teaching environment you’re in, highly recommend making students wear masks times wearing mask well face shield. key reducing likelihood spread. can’t force students, make sure using n95 mask fits well keep distance. Ask students speak unless required speak softly then. 

It’s really stressful situation sure. Hang advocate safety much possible. life value... aren’t sacrificial lamb. Hopefully you’ll access vaccine coming weeks. Maybe. doubt help spread pressure healthcare system. seems like social/political negotiation, decision based science improving public health crisis - mayor previously claimed doing. Deaths long term consequences auto-accidents either. People get paralyzed every single day. 

And yet, highways shutdown, arbitrary curfews enforced, people living fear similar number deaths/consequences. idle curiosity. Sweden atm 24 pandemlympics. point become blindingly obvious Sweden functionally different strategy many countries? I’m wearing mask I’m vaccinated unless store requires - since don’t go stores anyway (my husband does), won’t even notice. currently wear masks every time I’m outside walking around. That’s gonna change.  RRH URMC? sounds like doves cry. doves mean D-oomers. call constitutionalists Yeah gonna sh\*t show right conclusion I'm afraid. Especially many even comply vaccinated 2021 vaccine becomes widely available. approve method.  whispering getting flu shot ""how know water?"" Spends next two days falling asleep sofa. Immune response, check. keep analogy, can’t drive anywhere either. It’s like seatbelt drive. Red lights, one way streets, lanes, exist avoid need seatbelt job. 

All said though, absolutely right rest isn’t easy, don’t think could argue way life depended it. 

Curfews seem stupid, Canada don’t that, gathering limits something get behind, it’s reason many friends haven’t thrown parties past year. 

As businesses, don’t see much better solution closing public now. WANT see better solution know people’a livelihoods depend businesses, don’t see one.  WH task force telling people Michigan ""Resist!"" mitigation measures couple weeks back? people imprisoned awaiting trial?

Edit: believe state duty prevent unnecessary harm state custody. positively shocking. Anti Mask, Anti Restrictions Owner, claimed Restaurant ""Autonomous Zone"" continued serving indoors 0 restrictions. Cops came ""Autonomous Zone"" combative. said “These sheriff’s officers ‘wannabe’ cops. happens little people get little power.”

This guy emcompasses far fringe Right Far Fringe Left....at time!! Impressive. /s couple developed Pfizer vaccine Turkish muslim immigrants Germany  Haha, I'm ma'am sir, welcome regardless. 47% people willingly STILL support person pretended exist eight months, see uniting possible. trust 90% products come China, trust vaccine?  US make priority list children last, roll out, they'll trials kids. time run priority list, trials done. Scum like want virus it’s restrictions last long possible. You’re sick head Idk, team really young offensive side ball may defensive slog still fun. Husky stadium would’ve rocking since think slated one CFB kickoffs, real bummer didn’t happen. yeah definitely weird, fall nice change pace typical tailgating slate really excited get back next year. task force ignoring white house thing? Perhaps paying attention, seems like last week seen major flip meeting months, declaring pandemic over, actual doctors leave go work states directly.  Every day delicious cocktail d00mer tears argument ""which demographic interacts comparatively less others"", ""is demographic sufficiently segregated rest vaccinating 70% confer herd immunity them"". aren't. I'm sure exactly struggling with.

I'm struggling I'm arguing someone seemingly terminal case contrarian brain move goalposts discovered true reason. small sample size equates entirety world... see. Pretty blunt but... sometimes be. truth don’t clue vaccines effective way.

Stop fearmongering. shown trials 90% effective. I'm trolling guy correction. correct. phase III trials done guidance regulatory bodies. They've reached phase III targets. full dataset definitely exists, published yet. FDA review full dataset vaccine approved (as I'm sure UK equivalent FDA done). They're making decisions based press releases alone. 

Covid-19 disease characterized symptoms. vaccine prevents symptoms. know prevent asymptomatic infection SARS-CoV2 virus. main concern whether we'll able reach enough herd immunity protect people can't vaccinated. There's real reason think asymptomatic infection would lead long-term side effects, even does, delaying vaccine would cost hundreds thousands lives regardless. joke like ""science invented science"". Atheists hate see demography atheism. First wave mean first line. guys get triggered G-word it’s hilarious Gotcha, worldwide, coordinated conspiracy hundreds thousands scientists politicians across kinds geographical borders, one that. course one lying except you! truth! That's said. said 100 million people contracted covid January, life would back normal percentage population immune can't spread virus..that decreases R0. Let's twist words. We'd still social distance, wear masks, covid would spread less. politics. European leaders want seen irresponsible cover arses remote case widely tested vaccines good enough UK, banana republic, goes wrong. internal political wrangles EU, political body worried self preservation anything else. country ""jumping start"" vaccinating people another could make leaders look bad, local politics unstable. lets level lowest common denominator. UK took advantage fact nothing shitshow anymore, political moral reason abide (most countries power approve vaccine EMA own, chose it) done. Hey Fauci! expert Reddit thinks your'e wrong! Yeah, that's scares too. proper precautions (which course properly), virus could less managed, albeit still deaths severe infections, much much lesser extent. Imagine virus even bit aggressive, we'd really screwed real mitigation efforts made, especially US. delay people's behaviour. takes lot effort determination new thing get used to. go stadiums became normal, going stadiums suddenly became new thing.

I think lot previous human activities involves physical meeting become less popular many years even achieved zero patient world wide. blood swaths dead bodies COVID. Chick filla better chicken Popeyes better chicken sandwich. Yes will.
You’ll learn accept relax giant ego. *91.4%* *39 confirmed cases* effective letting others empathize you. property end hands bank worse, imo. Unfortunately almost relief people (and tenants') circumstances. almost seems like people charge various levels basically telegraphing stricter lockdowns definitely coming. think element LA latest round basically gave restaurants enough notice least waste bunch food time around, hinting stricter measures trends reverse pointing stat plots showed definitely reversing.

It's bad people seem intellectually incapable coping stricter measures imposed immediately. pfizer man, pfizer man, whatever pfizer I'd look therapy. Genuinely. science says life safe, there's reason 'paranoid hell' months end. swear audacity people comment thread like: “If immunize fire fighters first wave, means delay completion immunizing first wave doctors nurses wait longer fire fighters using doses would gone them.

Firefighters younger fitter low risk complication Covid. much lower risk contracting covid say, meat packing plant employee, certainly lower healthcare workers.

Yes, like firefighters run burning buildings, also like nurses right nurses need vaccine firefighters fucking wait minute.

Shit, like meat packers? like, ""they're higher risk contracting complications, fuck them, firefighters""? Everyone wait turn.” COURSE PEOPLE UPVOTED COMMENT Man, tough. Completely understand desire included. directly interacting people close situations. makes sense.

However, also may likely survive general perhaps elderly person assisted home elderly doctor nurse. really difficult. point, calculation threshholds established when. going people get vaccinated first got vaccinated could waited, establish kind boundaries start. movie version it'll US-made vaccine distributed US, rest world might get montage we're lucky. thanks I'd rather get debate abortions think Covid vaccination rushed think another aspect side-effects.

Moderna/Pfizer made differently Oxford vaccine. Oxford vaccine might side-effects dna instead rna.

But know I'm getting oxford vaccine, I'll continue searching info. 

But outlook based basic understanding oxford vaccine will: 
*++a lot cheaper 
++readily transportable 
++easily stored* 
**---2/3 effective  
---probably side-effects injected**  
??? mentioned, know deals symptoms end getting it. Pfizer/Moderna said help symptoms heard oxford one 


&amp;nbsp;

but need study this. Because? sad think implications that: people die younger, lower life expectancy fit simply pass away rather living immunocompromised person. key words headline “could” “if.” Similarly *could* avoided whole thing since March *if* entire country taken seriously, worn masks social distanced are. words lot heavy lifting ultimately statement mirror one’s confirmation bias. 

What I’m trying tell you’re setting disappointment you’re alone. Majority scientific discoveries made religious people ok mean, benefit calm retrospective analysis people may come put 250,000 dead context ... 2,800,000 die year. 

And weirdo comparisons 9/11 might faded then.

I hope.  Cool, makes feel much better. Thank much reply! didn’t say risk, said I’m group idea they’ve covid. could risk. might not. Could cold might safe people who’ve covid. 

The publicly available groups haven’t testing people who’ve exposure covid no, ADE would shown up. Looks like morning one said testing people who’ve covid it’s safe haven’t released data. shall see. That’s first I’ve heard actual testing people past covid infection. extensive testing it’s fine. tested one person calling good, that’s different situation. 

It’s anti science questions rapidly developed new style vaccine whether it’s safe personal situation. Thank you! Exactly looking find. **Imagine**

Yeah imagine!   ran outside grocery store mask (I took way car) gotten car hadn’t gotten yet, stood outside talking. aren’t anti-maskers all, promise. Lol no, pandemic ends say so. enough people get vaccine go back looking Palantir next global pandemic likely occur next time Philly needs grease lampposts prevent Super Bowl revelers climbing them. casual employee (i.e. paid leave) paid $300 whilst waited test results Came say this. Learned basic microbiology. Oh good lord people silly. Equine influenza makes rounds every year, many us vaccinate twice yearly result. believe nonsense they'd shit knew many contagious equine diseases floating around including nasties vaccine effective treatment. We've using protocol curb spread diseases like EIA, strangles, EHV etc including locking entire areas, counties even states equine travel long remember. dodgers fan I’ve waiting year boo cheating fucks person. I’m really hoping dodger stadium open public time come town agree. actually this, doctor, I'd say ""Fine, want treat you, then? treat for? procedures meds different flu? Cancer?

""Uhh..."" Yeah never realize important something much appreciate it’s taken away :/ though? Anyone brain cell know won't. pandemic really made change view America. drink overpriced coffee it. People still getting arrested jailed though. people driving too. cases per 10000 tested cases per 10000 overall? Yes. details mRNA vaccines interesting. know little long term effects.
It's getting really tough though. one side, pandemic killing people want it, willing take accept risks.
This reality.

On hand scientific community would like details studies this.

I hope, better prepared well studied methods next time. Phase 3 runs 2 years full. Emergency use granted based interim analysis.  jobs. Maybe need understand entails. haven’t sitting anything regarding vaccines, watch JAMA videos start making inaccurate statements. I’ve posted past months. Crazy works. perhaps thinking supermarkets staffed robots, food self driving trucks drove robotic automated farms.

But exist 2020. turns full lockdowns, large numbers people working jobs outside homes order provide you, could sit house safety.

Now realize possible everyone sit homes, course realize need vaccines put end epidemic. “Don’t bash place live places don’t live bad too” 

Solid logic. blind patriotism brain. tough, can't afford buy much year, I'm crafty. goes decorations. family really goes - usually get together year. bummer. know temporary, usually favorite day year get little bit older, appreciate one it. Yesterday history 🤷🏼‍♀️ don’t know that. patient loads insane, drowning work. never ends. certainly wasn’t bad spring. long shot. Yes.

Which contagious, asymptomatic 2 weeks? asymptomatic 2 days? Wow, pretty cool, find this? assumption incorrect. Soap kill microbes, viruses included. Soap works mechanically removing microbes skin. killing them. hope day gets better. weren’t wearing masks? like Michael Scott declaring bankruptcy? False. Viruses outer membrane. protein based capsid. Even bacterial membranes exposed, instead covered peptidoglycan layer. SOAP KILL MICROBES. did, would need specifically make anti-microbial soaps added compounds actually kill things?

Source: I'm microbiologist. hear saying hear saying dangerous situation. understanding right? things world talk though. 

Just record, someone tells scare pap smear results turned okay, sane response ""that's relief."" ""well people ashamed eat meat."" every conversation eat. That's what's called one track mind kind people tiresome humorless. country live right now? everyone ask doctors prescription.

Considering currently Covid-19, plan use it? antibodies quite time. They’ve working this, along vaccine companies months. working basically 24 hours day. Thanksgiving federal holiday. federal employees. 

If want learn process instead knee jerk complaints, excellent videos JAMA YouTube explain they’ve doing.

That’s criticism gets shut down, it’s factual. enjoy Christmas, maybe make home made gifts loved ones? Decorate can. temporary. Ugh. I’m sorry. got pretty early on. long ass couple months. hope get milder case. would information available government? lockdowns last spring, took around 3 months countries cases deaths significantly reduced. 3 weeks 30% reduction enough ""clean slate"", probably stopped spiraling control. No, didn’t lie. weren’t sure masks entirely effective yet. public statement made protect healthcare workers. 

Even wanna keep score, sub losing pretty pathetically. beginning pandemic, scrubbing hands soap water much hard started bleeding. began using hand lotion washing improved.

I guess skin adjusted new handwashing regime need near much hand lotion before. get fairly priced N95 masks online? ""Event"" not, risk zero.

What acceptable odds catch COVID grocery shop entire duration pandemic - say, one year (to optimistic)? Let's say 10%.

How many times go shop entire duration? Say week, that's 50 times.

Then odds catching COVID visit, satisfy global 10% threshold? Divide 50, 0.2%.

If odds catching 0.2% visit shop, whole pandemic odds become 10%. without needing jump car? meet outside bit chat. got like 10,000 replies Astoria :) it’s main Goonies spot sure! far all. It’s basic story over. hear statements hospital too, even don’t die sickened. gotten old. It’s discouraging many must directly suffer lose loved ones see it’s truly serious virus. 

All people given socializing seeing friends family months hopefully suffer loss like this. haven’t seen family either. point, I’m even determined keep us safe. It’s worth everything we’ve missed on. Imagine taking seriously knowing next year, won’t people love holiday table. Imagine knowing could prevented that. understand vaccines also undergo safety testing continuing monitoring? know asymptomatic spread. evidence makes significant portion spread. 

Here's thing - reduction transmissibility lack symptoms counteracted fact asymptomatic people less like stay home take safety precautions. 
Instead staying home bed, instead knowing spread it, going lives. mean time spreading virus, rather less, spreadable situations. Considering almost university students test positive covid asymptomatic , might hard find larger sample size. would wager whatever sytemic weakness caused long term covid symptoms also effected first place, non immunocompromised students shrug off. doesnt suggest average young person worried long term covid symptoms Straight-up dollar amount fines effectively mean rules apply rich people, effectively target poorer sections populace. really way apply fines punishment codify fraction wealth income, [like much scandanavia happening folks.

For reason headline thought meant California Ohio.  agree fuck got mine mentalities. moral thug. True, everything Trump. But, Trump’s base Trump. concretely encourage base wear masks reduce spread, individuals likely anti-mask Covid-denying would greatly reduced.

I agree, everything Trump. Everything willingness protect others small cost comfort.

Where protests wearing pants stores? fine people required wear pants “decency” masks face pandemic. That’s quite claim. back up? 1 person know received still making less last several years. everyone lost jobs low wage earners. Trump makes everything Trump. golf ~2k Americans dying daily. can't even fked enough ask people take precautions. Pathetic. Thank you. Someone sound head. keep hearing people telling long lasting effects evidence one article found facebook reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

One day REAL data available. Today day deaths Europe high abit longer. Remember deaths lag since many countries extremely high cases long ago it'll take time deaths fall. deaths infected weeks ago cases still sky high rising countries. mean 2/3 weeks ago France still averaging 40k cases day downside? OP say huge event like make change. said huge event likely cause change definitely downside since gone suffering society learned nothing. Well title says pfizer-biontech right there. people know pfizer never heard BioNTech. Thats shitty ass argument. full lockdowns supermarkets ALWAYS open food always available that, approximately 14 million Americans tested positive Covid. There’s also estimates catching 1/4 1/6 cases positive tests. could significantly higher too, JHU/CDC fatality rate 2% could even 10 20. 

So multiply 4 divide 330 million population, that’s 17%. worst days ahead us, behind us. end winter, 30% population may contracted Covid. vaccinate another 20% March, coupled seasons changing, summer could well normal. Rammstein tickets September 2021.

Dont mess selfish people. Mask up! Always remember get extra pickles. understanding, docs still reusing N95s. extra cloth mask top add protection, per se. 

Here SoCal, docs wear one N95, day, surgical mask top, replace time see new patient. fussed governments fake silver bullet long write virus - sort working cancer cure ill impressed overjoyed  Wow. Interesting read. Thanks.

An article anyone curious Someone know coworker test positive Monday. flight Thursday. decided get tested Wed fly anyway certain ok. Luckily negative still widely irresponsible. 
Also. fly back forth problem seen less 2 weeks. Vaccine manufacturer releasing vaccine requirement accountable anything goes wrong. also skewed ways measuring effectiveness didnt release stage 3 trial data all

There also question long vaccine effective type long term side effects mrna vaccines Remember, ICU capacity fills three weeks, filling already delay two weeks. wishes shared family members. checked beneficiary information.

I practical. Doctors plane take vaccine say would protect communities. vaccine make shed virus? Shedding virus exactly protecting communities. There's thing free market. market modulated crony capitalism actively hostile public good. hear you. let's take something smaller even healthcare. Say town floods big storm. What's free market approach? Give us money we'll sell boat, new shingles roof, etc. Sure maybe company donates canned goods. Chances good they'd ask employees donate food items. free market operates extract resources advancement. can't pull resources, market.

I'm saying abolish market. Far it. market place. point, many issues market can't solve. Patriotism? 2001? Cut BS, one younger 40 real patriotism. left broken dreams brand Ben Jerry’s.  Reacting first part comment reading helpful. disinformation misunderstandings spread. Take advice educate taking much information making judgement.   see Jesus gates pretends know (or worse) evangelical (ministers) awful people use religion way attaining wealth power others. sure right spot ask like, wtf conspiracy theories vaccine made kill us ""The Great Reset"". browsed ""r/conspiracy"" bit damn seems like everyone agrees bullshit. Good, stay out. people stupid. whole western world covid Ikr? struck contra “division church state”. 

Like, thought democracy, pandemic like world war state steps help. Instead, resorts exhorting us fasting prayer?! 

What fatwas calling beheadings, it’s getting like ISIS around day 😣 Given logistics I'd expect wait. EU (FDA...) decides approve announced meetings, I'd deliver doses elsewhere, organizing shipping different location worth couple weeks. different item clothing put morning. Hardly even realize now. gave worthless internet point honesty. Funny, me. higher range action taken stop spread... way expected unless really think someone would ignore something killing hundreds thousands, millions people.

We've twice many deaths per million Europe, 2.5x canada... many unnecessary deaths badly handled US nationally. don’t think surprise covid directly—it’s surprise government knows telling us it’s liberal hoax we’re magically going stop hearing election.  regulators United States still fucking around? Approve shit already. ""Centre"" India? Nice could tell us people too, never know even names.. sure reference me, not.
But clearly, idea asking, I'm like. 

but, let stop you. Well, explains why! Goodness! 

Event organizers assumed people coronavirus antibodies “not contagious,”  don’t trust 2020 especially don’t trust people motivated enough get asses wait extremely long line especially since need two shots one week later Trumper Logic: ""Fake News ... feel fine."" Like yeah, don’t care wearing mask long go concert, Uni classes person normal life meeting friends again. Honestly, countries also lot smaller US much smaller population. 

Still, measures taken late largely insufficient bring numbers considerably. Let's this! Thank much in-depth answer. Definitly clears lot doubts had. course can't sure 100% risk waaaay better Pandemic, that's sure. is, work UPS factory, wearing mask back truck filling 120⁰F straight torture. Reeves proves world class moron. one devise plan stupid ineffective?

Require masks every county time virus spread slow. Oxford/Astrazenica vaccine cheaper produce easier distribute third world countries. long. Yeah one every day. Big red wave Rollin through! Boots ground probably post nice example schools failing emphasize critical thinking skills. share it, like shared peer reviewed Phase I/II data Jama. need misinformation based rampant sinophobia. reason think trial run poorly. dosing error, kind thing happen. certainly reflection rest trial. fact Oxford actually publishing results peer reviewed journal unlike manufacturers.

Not based _**former**_ point, but... 1) don’t know long term consequences 

Agree. know long term effects specific set mRNA vaccines _except_... 2) AFAIK mRNA approach, deemed safe, technically also “novel” vaccines, don’t actually know happen longer term. think know it’s theoretical point.

You're wrong here, too--- [researchers studied used mRNA vaccines even create vaccine proteins zika, rabies, cytomegslovirus... obviously tested _human_ model-- ""novel,"" exactly. TBH, I'm happy country full lockdown birthday loving wife, else resisted going fastfood. I'm kind guy happy stay home playing video games. I'm talking three waves US experienced, first third. summer wave. guinea pigs ones living lockdown, totally unprecedented dangerous response pandemic. vaccine what's going bring things back normal. Various countries going back testing old samples. China isn't. has, published results. Furthermore, based antibodies testing, false positives cannot ruled out.

To quote WHO's Ryan, suggestions SARS-2 might originated outside China, ""highly speculative"" Yeah, awful. really want surgery ever ever ever ever ever (did say ever) again. need coffee ughghghg Without long term effects seniors compromised people known (which concern brought determining gets IM vaccine first) *if* able develop vaccine safer as/more efficient explore avenue? besides, rollout current vaccines projected take months developed countries additional vaccine could help safely vaccinate people susceptible side effect also help stymie spread countries waiting turn shot get them. think worth exploring, especially since many unknowns point. Well USA open, countries refuse help citizens coming USA... measles R0 10+. However COVID-19 much less contagious need nearly high. Doesn’t surprise me. buddy someone work test positive COVID. here’s kicker. two parents lives with, COVID positive past two weeks. 

And decided let everyone know. Since then, 3 people tested positive. 

I fucking hate country people much sometimes. can’t fake level stupidity. Yup. governor cried announced it. Still, people won’t give shit. disagree Funny thing though, apparently nasal flu vax really work, even kids. read package insert, noticed initial trials reach primary endpoint all, re-analyzed. Since then, post-marketing experience pretty disappointing.

I'm sure probably got something immunosuppression drugs he's taking, yep. would say mainly know better treatment methods now. Doctors things instead putting respirator directly, respirators invasive last-resort option. financially stable, middle class, healthy social life lost job, moved poorer class, socialized months probably suffering.

The fact highest government officials equate complete total shutdown, supplementing citizens income meantime, would saved tens thousands lives hundreds thousands infections, economy, importantly, people's livelihoods, would better overall. Australia testament that. 

Yet government officials demanded economy keep rolling. thought actually paying citizens stay home right thing clearly foreign concept American government. clear interest safety wellbeing citizens, really shakes core. think it’s likely vaccine widely available spring especially job that’s essential.

[I uploaded pics took slides Sorry potato pictures. screenshot reasons can't get into. Except rather large number high risk people won’t get vaccinated. Given comparatively tiny sample size older seniors, obese, diabetic hypertensive people know, I’m optimistic. three quarters explicitly said wont take vaccine.

I’d trusting vaccines tested mostly people known exposed virus.   90% efficacy means nothing 90% never left homes without mask. long anyone Mercer family gets last! Herd mentality. None see threat one talk sees threat. Well one friends saw threat, really hanging now... L.A. County COVID-19 Cases Hospitalizations Soar Pass Previous All-time Highs- 46 New Deaths 7,593 New Confirmed Cases COVID-19 Los Angeles County support lockdowns support financial assistance small businesses. right attitude have. Good you! guy.........Randy Quaid play movie version 2020. would give RQ work. NO!! Alaska nice. Send em florida.  Dude literally ignoring actual fact bullshit fear

This look back feel stupid  whole state going get wiped idiot governor’s policies? Among non-white respondents, included African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian Americans, individuals two races, 42 percent said would somewhat likely get vaccine one available today

I would like see individual breakdowns asian americans tend trend extremely differently minorities means ""covid death count"" disingenuous. someone disease going kill them, catch covid/flu/pneumonia, doesnt suddenly make covid dangerous. hazardous sickly weak.

Nuking 25% small businesses already planning destroying even biden shuts nation down.....again......for something isnt harmful healthy people preposterous. 99.98% survival rate healthy person age 50. isnt ""pandemic"". outbreak small-pox, Bubonic Plague, would pandemic. simply new illness people eventually insulate naturally time.

I'm 34 never flu shot. Why? going away dangerous. Duh Gettin' real tired shit, humanity. think braindamage starts there, yes. 90 me. think New Zealand proud handled coronavirus. time, island somewhat remote geographically. New Zealand gets 3 million international visitors year. sounds really high find New York City gets 13 million international visitors year.

New Zealand done really well, geography also put really fortuitous position. can't really compare New Zealand countries. hindsight, poor decision.

like hindsight could every day numbers went back up?

you take rad suit levels start going down, take radiation gone.

it's like people stop taking blood pressure meds blood pressure normalized. hospitalization, jackass. kidney dialysis, braindead piece shit. brother able smell taste food since summer. think that's nothing, fucking garbage scumbag? fuck wrong you? got friend able read book since caught back March. top-rate software developer, built game-changing software worldwide impact. can't even read fucking book. think that's nothing? fuck dreamworld live number look death rate, delusional human trash? people surviving covid nonetheless teeth drop fucking heads. death rate completely fucking irrelevant question, utterly worthless evil little shit. Lemme one better: ""toxic heteropatriarchy"" even better term, imo. really, really, staggeringly, horribly, brutally bad. Covid bless her. long saves even 1 life COVID, worth it.

right? certainly people inside since March let’s face it...not many all. come subreddit would think everyone is. call BS people say actually stayed socially distant whole time haven’t seen people outside household unmasked (or people say haven’t single restaurant/store/etc.). Airports packed, malls packed, gyms ton people even open. bet lot people hide and/or never post things done social media avoid getting response like subreddit. even friends pro-lockdown online yet agree hang place (and even restaurants/gyms). people whose wedding went still talk quarantine stories lmao... Make mandatory fines / jail time.

Nah. say strip make walk shame GoT style. I'm 97 99 times. difference 92 97 really strong? I've light Asthma heyfewer also smoked lot younger, still smoke joints would really hate give up. 

But % make difference, I'll probably need consider that. think Canadians proven pretty effectively we’re equally irresponsible. still ""Truthiness"" side nature thinning herd. murder. understimate power lobbies. opinion worth much, I'm expert, yes, I'd assume mandatory. plenty reasons to. vaccine change anything. long time anyways. non American. cheaper pay someone living South Dakota San Francisco. Americans.. mention, anti-vaxxers eventually immunize since they're breaking protocols. ""But refuse take serious add situation."" 

I led believe sub, Americans behaved like this. Breaking: White House released updated version map ""NO COVUD"" written Sharpie, guess we're okay now. Idc masks don’t want bill “nelly” gates rushed vaccine reason anyone gives shit attractive. good reason governor.  life valuable guest respectful -if nothing else, he’s jeopardizing roof head brings virus home you! Inconsiderate horrific disrespect every level. think recall gets really dangerous 80. 

Thats dying. Get hospital sooner that. forget cancer folk peeps AIDS. pediatric cancer wards hopefully acting space station level security. Anti-vaxxers guess people culled? 

Don't listen me, eat frozen eggos often drink wine mayo jar.....(I'm ashamed) Lol conservative dad said me. ""Well know statistics trust, like old pre-existing conditions dying?""


Like, preexisting conditions, okay die!? WTF UNLESS DISTANCED GATHERINGS hahahaha bunch nonsense. Saying like putting someone balancing beam surrounded pit deadly spikes making take bunch sleeping pills saying ""no harm come unless fall asleep"". allowing supporting people put beam hopped full sleeping pills first place? Can't agree way. anything less almost entirely useless platitude. business made public everyone knows. telling people good either. FDA reviewing Pfizer next week, Moderna well? chance vaccines approved EUA 10th? better hell tRump holding atomic football! Or, like extra premium smokers. don’t take vaccine, insurance 20% premium payment. Yes, almost certainly good degree protection first dose. second dose booster. discussion placebo retention group. One reasons volunteer trial expectation get vaccine soon shown safe effective trial. 

It’s generally considered unethical give vaccine find vaccine safe effective. It’s Moderna Pfizer gave vaccine placebo group soon first results came showing 90-95% efficacy. 

Part clinical trials trial intentionally cause harm. allowing people vaccinated safe effective vaccine volunteered part trial happened get placebo would less fit definition causing intentional harm. IRB (let alone FDA) would ever approve it.

What possible get vaccine may ask part trial see long immunity vaccine lasts. Um no. I’m pro vax anti authoritarian churches really piss off, reason public health officials keep making exceptions people go talk imaginary sky fairy special house acting irrational. science behind all, exemptions don’t want risk offending people suffering mass delusion, putting rest us risk.

Groceries? Ok; man gotta eat survive, church service? damned irresponsible. used reasoning start daughter school district's virtual option, parents get it. said, ""socialisation important part growth age,"" doubt is, seeing main way catching shit socialisation going time grow person dead, staying home. 

They put quotes school board meeting local paper every single person saying kids go back either kids three more. people give shit kids others common sense save lifetime pain ass pulling out, they're pissed they're missing free daycare someone good nurse doesn’t mean smart. I’ve met DUMB healthcare workers, it’s surprise 60% would get vaccine. 

Still...better nothing. I'm curious high % getting it. I'll dig submitted trail data remember bad adverse effects trials. Respirator particulate filter work well- better n95 well fitted believe, HOWEVER works protect others others since usually one way valve breath without filtering. mean, they've nearly entire year.... health care system run limited numbers covid tests?

This could valid cope, alas, reality cruel. African countries also low positivity rate. Maybe that's something others could learn from? reason why? I-O!!! According people keep posting percentages death age, matter. COVID kills old people. Case closed.

/s hope sarcastic upvoters. interest vaccine Covid.

I'm anti vax, infact i'm thankful many vaccines prevent us developing really nasty conditions consider Covid serious virus interest getting vaccinated it. means you’ll get free vaccine? bill make vaccine free, article question vaccine. Theres like thousands pages data FDA go through, that's taking 3 weeks review it. imagine many people they’ve endangered. atrocious behaviour. currently understand (which isn’t much) vaccines, no. Social distancing masks undoubtedly us well 2022 earliest can’t right, heard taking fall spring would lead non existing second wave. also heard 30percent immune back august. Stockholm would achieve herd immunity weeks may. vaccine isn’t 100% effective it’s known whether vaccine prevents infection, prevents severe COVID symptoms looked symptomatic cases. didn’t test everyone infection trial, that’s point Yes. person highest political position could consistently told us CDC recommendations, pressured/intimidated put incorrect information, remove scientifically based recommendations website.

That person also could followed guidelines themself held super spreader events.

Furthermore person highest political position could refrained openly mocking wore masks, advocated group people planned kidnapping assassination attempt governor promoting precautions.

There ton ton could administration chose do. could done chose do. Repeatedly. yeah, fair, phone-posting trips often, usually end missing word phrase process post. I’m assuming doesn’t stop virus shedding. never claimed did. Yet seems people still disagree obvious truth see here. far know still know math, hope long term damage. WA one major Hospital networks mandatory volunteers well. flu - TB, Measles, etc. Exactly. I’m sure anyone could see ways inmates would prioritized law abiding senior citizens immunocompromised people. Kudos Colorado governor shame Colorado state health department. month coronavirus deaths Europe dozens thousands people. 

This consequence starting vaccination program ""few weeks later"". ""pride"".

It quite amusing. People saying deadly thing earth, measure matter drastic taken stop worth it, saying perfectly fine extremely well paid people sit solution month more. really matter. emergency measures last 8 months totally justified, time approve vaccine, emergency procedures needed go regular route.

They blood hands. Nothing less that. Well early sure yet, 99.9999% sure bad, hard tell much yesterdays count new deaths, backlog due essentially 5 day weekend. course can.

Just well. they’re vaccinated, long.

There perfect. transmission drops R0=1, virus dies out. Going multi-week contagion window several day window decimate overall R value virus Could clarify think skipped insufficient safety testing vaccines? think people consider chronic pain mentally. wears takes every aspect life. Exactly. Especially COVID going long term side effects. wish article pointed webpage cdc.gov. still saying full 14 days: downvote disagreement. 

And sycophant either. Think. know, heard said 

*shiny new excuse grow mullet*

I know new pandemic project is! One good thing? Two three vaccines everyone hailing, made US directly supported US. US made one, made Moderna, highest efficacy rate. UK made one got someone killed trial. world (or Reddit) loves pile US, end day, they’re waiting US vaccines. yet, soon data actually proves wrong.  argue people, think anything short absolute perfection good enough. probably think people places like SK Norway psychotic keeping people locked there's vaccine. 

The fact Americans think ""normal life"" extroverted one instead something simple know, kids able see grandparents. That's one reasons COVID response poor states, everything done excess. able see 1 2 friends enough, people able throw house parties every night else life worth living.

I'm sure know can't go full 180 get vaccinated places still restrictions certain level vaccinations met, yes probably still wear mask public required. that's small ask people many things able change: able see older relatives, meet vaccinated people community person, go road trip, go bar. life *will* able change better start process gradually getting back normal wait rest world catch up. Math strong point country Yeah could presymptomatic asymptomatic, spread travel never even know contributed hospitalizations. That's kinda we're mess begin with! know virus spreads regardless slim chances family getting sick is, go significantly travel spend time indoors them. Yes understand efficient give money volunteers third world country? read this. know gotten nutty WH telling public health officials circumvent state's government leaders. thinking that, % comply lockdown afterwards.  Thanksgiving make bad, even 50% still go make worse. Thank kind sir. looked further, saw fees referencing administrative fees applied people getting free vaccine. 

It administrative fees guess people trying get waived well. ok. better kentucky fried msg, good chick fillet less bigotry Yea fuck wanting survive keep business. wrong, make less fucked up. many items agree risk introduced someone smoker, drinker, obese, etc...but going lot situations someone going screwed choose infected COVID. science disagrees you, may help introspective. That's like anti-vaxxers rejecting evidence confirm feelings. vaccine stops majority people hospitalized cares? Seriously? Viruses exist. part life earth. don’t need eradicate covid. I’m usually happy conservative federal government, give kudos paying majority people stay home. incredibly strict lockdown wouldn’t possible without it, couldn’t eradicated community transmission without it. October 23rd, 2077 make compelling argument aren’t. Charge attempted murder. got easy. would ok get go, told needed eradicated death planet. die cast, choice see means getting vaccine. places, probably, many places can't find workers. country, contrary popular belief, record employment numbers. Yeah, probably bunch idiots. expert vaccine science, you? Let's see phd friend. maybe got epidemiology, since clearly solutions pandemic, right? must well informed subject confident viewpoint shared significant number verified, trustworthy professionals.

I think, fact, one taking things face value. bad feelings vaccine social distancing trump hard science flared Good News opinion. Viral load (it’s actually dose load) making difference case outcome/severity purely theory proven, would largely unique virus true, throwing there. Silly. Law order dirty blacks protest equal rights treatment. Violence noble purposes opposing heath measures patriotic

/s  many communities, fire service responds 3-4X number medical calls call outs actual fires.  Every firefighter community certified EMT 1/4 paramedics. 911 called they're often EMS. 

Another thing consider firefighters can't work they're exposed sick, backup mutual aid agreements nearby communities.  Keeping able safely work critical overall safety community residents, firefighters high priority vaccine. Probably lot less died superspreaders. President Elect Joe Biden. feel way, want able research one choose one get, probably mean wait back line (for luxury choosy), hopefully that's realistic option want go route. yes exactly, like said bad Yeah.. still boggles mind bit relatively healthy January .. borderline dead late March-April.. 6 8 months, arguably better health Jan. quite rollercoaster wrap head around. 

It's even crazier watch Covid19 pandemic unfolded we're creeping 300,000 dead.. underlined reminder lucky still alive. 

Pretty crazy year. catch friends seen year more,. ask it,. I'm always like:.. ""I know.. got 4 hours hear story?.. :) similar thing see peaks spring autumn, find countries. also expect development since US states peaking different times creating sort buffer effect low case high case average out. wanna say, independent contractor I've unemployed restricted benefits/financial aid (you needed multiple employees, business owner sole employee got shafted)

The government care us, assuming people who've work making magically money insulting growing hunger concerns we'll able make ends meet another month even remotely true. Many places help wanted signs months. issue statement Illinois looks better neighbors. That's true look politics state handling it, actual outcome.  true, also everyone else traveling thinking. raindrop thinks responsible flood all.

Not judging anything we're trying best ofc. Well, opted college home (which voluntary country), distanced anyone risk.

Once go movies, go visit one good friends, would lose sanity alone time.

I'm afraid myself. I'm afraid people might infect sick. movies, everyone went chose risk well. Reading comments defying pandemic protocol go gym... logic people drive without license claim right “free travel.” absolute idiot society doesn’t put with. hope go jail end infecting people. Really? Guards...visitors...health care professionals...administrative staff...vendors...inspectors...

Have jail before? There's reason there's front desk log well shipping receiving areas people time. point guards source infection. vector serves source, spreads like wildfire. vaccines impressive, must proud. want man do? There’s one paying even loaning money bills, help government. can’t blame man won’t surprise ends winning court. hate say hear gasps already, rest homes workers protected good practices, something can't always protect work essential product stores, something can't always protect working schools. Yea, right. Pfizer approved UK, guess they'll get guinea pigs. Pfizer doesn’t even BioNTech far know, partnerships Exactly. founders science atheists, like people world today. talking life insurance, health insurance. two different things US.  high risk people gonna getting access vaccine anyway argument pointless.

Anyone can’t get vaccine health reasons needs shield take precautions. infrastructure allows people everything contactless. 

There moral argument justifies people curbing pursuit happiness vaccine available general public. shouldn’t wait herd immunity. Hey maybe vaccine thoroughly tested, even animal testing done(yes skipped this) might wider effect. don’t know though vaccine properly tested. Nice. I'd here. basically everyone else told you, kindly fuck off.

Your stats self-serving point, reveal whole picture. completely ignore man oxygen rest life. think that's impacted quality life all? No? big deal?

You also fail realize still thick this. People still dying this. numbers continue rise rise even get vaccine. ignorance arrogance reveals lack care anyone yourself. perhaps also reveals fact could scared shitless need puff chest pretend like everything's ok. not, could people like fuck up. Even country would getting oxford-az vaccine I'm hoping good things Lack oxygen bad. brain last 3 minutes without damaged, 6 minutes dead. HISTORIC Awesome! get serology test. Assuming everyone taken vaccine. Remember measles outbreak years ago? charge void accountability

Right. Exactly opposite, fact.  allowed happen office certain cases, otherwise prosecution would actually used political tool, general agree.

People authority required open held accountable anyone without.  Mayors, cops, governors, Presidents, anyone. power, accountability transparency required. Long term health studies take TIME. one primary reasons eight month timeline developing testing new class vaccines making doctors scientist nervous. Extrapolation bad. right that.

But, here's thing, passive aggressive douchebag pretty much validates railing - presuming course American. Something absolutely zero doubt.

And, feel like point spelled analyses wrong, definitely multiple scientists. NH radar past 2-3 weeks. watched moved search volume Covid testing Covid tests. Still high still ways go new cases, unfortunately, senate never made represent people, that’s house something something democrats fault!!!!! Could see DeSantis guy Republicans run next 2024. It’s called straw broke camels back. pre existing conditions called mortality. die eventually covid virus take sooner. Covid straw Ouch Well half country refuses wear mask anyway. idiotic misunderstanding herd immunity drives crazy. 

Almost farmer rancher tell animal serious infection, quarantine rest herd best get others vaccinated. let mingle normal. 

And bad cull herd putting sick ones save rest. Lol. clearly troll. nice one. think genetics general impacts it, simply people process glucose better others.  5.7 cutoff high normal. Anything 5.7 considered pre-diabetic.

I reactive hypoglycemia another risk factor diabetes (my body releases much insulin naturally eat sugar empty stomach, causing crash.) Add family history diabetes (dad it, sister it) something doctor watch carefully. ""I hunch"" invented time machine gone back screened people airports. useful 20/20 hindsight. much international though. I'm happy doubt meant to, bit. Context comments always based reader. Frig Mr. Lahey understand next nothing truly cannot imagine vaccine that's (as far know) nothing altered version actual virus concerning prospect virus itself, especially given potential long-term effects virus. tell makes penis’s small wear masks go bigger pick truck put bigger Trump flags  guess wearing strap ( mask ) going popularity. r/s  Know tons people moved CA/NY Miami. may also plan quarantine 2021 also...  know theatrical release, stipulation film theaters minimum week eligible.

I loved think went straight amazon prime. What's mechanism happen? ""FWIW"" sacbee claimed going covid related story available free everyone. Whether means ads behind paywalls nonsubscribers whatever, supposedly accessible everyone. funny part is, two ways accomplish …

1 tell everyone stay home behave, watch ignore it.

2 make price running around burning fuel high, choice stay home.

Which one think best probability succeeding ? learn time cant stop stupid. Use advantage senses word.   Based what? We're Winter now. going sharp spikes followed months gradual decline like first waves. going surge surge surge get spring. 

You believe me, I'll absolutely take bet. Interesting. wonder countries seeing max others aren't, terms hospitalizations. increase ICU bed capacity US too, things like turn pediatric ICUs adult ICUs convert floor hospital. also set field hospitals provide beds.

Problem is, one magically make health care workers poof existence. *""Academy Says 2022 Oscars Presented Two Nights Accommodate Longer Usual 'In Memoriam' Segment""* I’ll watching it, it’s good background noise I’m stuff Ah, welcome March, 2020 again. Nice see you. Borat 2 lmao   helmets though. Full natural selection, toughest independent survive Same. fucking selfish, entitled piece shit are. It’s you, dumbass. It’s protecting people high risk. That’s wear masks social distance. You’ll take serious one loved ones dies I’ve heard friends get tested anytime want states. 
My local friends, everyone tried get tested, denied. friends Portland well. I’m Oregon Coast. one know town able convince local satellite campus Adventist hospital test us sick. Thank you, visit pulmonologist yearly, missed back October ask them. really apt comparison it? I’d go comparison shop allowing entrance don’t wear mask. bet think that’s okay either “freedom” whatever. vaccine 100% effective

there way knowing sure long remains effective That's experience. think borders two countries wrong place, merge coasts countries United States Canada turn middle states provinces Jesusland. values beliefs people would blend better would solve lot problems. Jesusland complain landlocked give Florida. jeez, literally looks like gecko fence like huge cattle ranch.

The source find quickly says obese tripled risk hospitalization. 3x small percentage still small percentage. It’s even order magnitude. seems like it. I’m doctor working covid unit. Absolutely go emergency department 90% oxygen saturation. try admit people require oxygen (saturation 90 requires oxygen) unless another reason admitted (for example dehydration). think need admitted, try go urgent care pcp office instead emergency department order keep wait times really sick people need admitted. go hospital covid test mild symptoms. Google nearest covid test site is. hope helps someone! Stay safe! definitely antivax covid denier nurses, id imagine lot arent taking take eventually want others take first. think fair take approach. going say something completely defies common sense, boldly without explanation that’s always say. I'd see says results page. rapid tests accurate PCR tests. facing staff

In brain included group. point, guess technically considered medical classified ""Healthcare workers"" residents considered ""patients"". It’s absurd remember seeing tourism ad local beach town (I live dreaded state/FL). showed hotel restaurant staff walking around masks tourists/guests ad maskless smiling. want give false sense staff people around protect tourists/guests don’t need think fun.  Cool. person oscars nobody watch. Money big factor course, could changed.

Do vaccines get cheaper wait? (Legit question, know charging first, think companies would really know.) dungeness crabs hella racist. less zero possibility taking long. want realistically pessimistic, fall 2021, even likely going happen.

The idea would take two years distribute vaccine priority number one almost every world government bonkers me. Care wager numbers?

Id think they’d like know daycare basically whole town(next door school, city owned) outbreak, apparently not. hoarded 3 years worth TP case. Hmm guess I’m little curious think hospitals collapse people going field hospitals sent home, people listen. might Christmas.

No need reinvent wheel, drug repurposing may fastest cheapest way treat people infected coronavirus, experts told Tel Aviv University conference.

By Abigail Klein Leichman, ISRAEL21c

Scientists racing develop medications treat people ill Covid-19. drug development testing take many years millions dollars.

What medications already exist could repurposed tackle Covid-19?

That topic recent webinar hosted Tel Aviv University’s Spark program, helps move discoveries bench bedside, nonprofit MedInsight Institute, seeks novel treatments safe, effective, accessible, affordable.

Participants described Israeli drug-repurposing scene opportunities could immediately benefit people infected SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

First public Jewish wedding UAE attracts curious spectators

“Of 9,000 currently approved drugs exist globally, potential overcoming Covid-19 certainly exists,” said event organizers.

“Instead reinventing wheel, need harness efforts identify existing drugs treat Covid-19, select safest ones, validate efficacy utilizing rapid evaluation methods tailored times crisis.”

Drugs side benefits
Many older affordable generic drugs — proven safe treating ulcers, high cholesterol, heart arrythmia, parasites, erectile dysfunction conditions — multiple “side benefits” battle effects Covid-19, said Moshe Rogosnitzky, cofounder executive director MedInsight Research Institute based Israel New York.

“Some drugs used alone combination drugs,” Rogosnitzky said.

The main Covid-related conditions must treated respiratory failure, cardiac failure, coagulopathy (bleeding disorder), kidney failure systemic inflammation. gets worse virus continues replicating.

MedInsight’s Cureiosity database collects information off-label drug uses, diseases, symptoms pathways.


 
Information mined database relevant Covid conditions published JMIR Public Health &amp; Surveillance.

“For example, anti-ulcer drug Famotidine, costs $5 per month, cardio-protective antiviral, found recently anti-Covid-19 effects. one drugs used cocktail treat President Trump,” Rogosnitzky said.

“Sildenafil, pulmonary hypertension erectile dysfunction, protects lungs, heart kidneys anti-inflammatory,” continued.

“Anti-cholesterol fibrates, cost $10-$20 per month, protect kidneys heart, anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, mildly antiviral found [Hebrew University researcher] Dr. Yaakov Nahmias potent anti-Covid-19 effects clinical trials planned,” Rogosnitzky concluded.

Anti-cholesterol drugs
Nahmias, director university’s Grass Center Bioengineering BioDesign medical innovation team, found cholesterol-lowering drug fenofibrate (a PPAR-alpha agonist) interferes coronavirus’ ability reproduce lungs.

He Dr. Benjamin tenOever New York’s Mount Sinai Medical Center reported promising results July.


 
At webinar, Nahmias said team used retrospective clinical data show PPAR-alpha agonists effectively reduce risk severe Covid-19 people metabolic risk factors obesity.

“Obesity risk factor asthma, though virus damages lungs,” Nahmias said.

After studying virus behaves lung cells, Nahmias’ lab used pioneering Tissue Dynamics organ-on-a-chip technology see effects virus metabolic processes.

“We found SARS-CoV-2 virus causes massive metabolic response, generating fatty acids cause lipotoxicity lungs,” said.

“We know kinds drugs correct problem, including statins fibrates among others. Fibrates shut virus five days. can’t block infection block secondary symptoms.”

His findings validated biopsies data 1,531 Covid-19 patients Tel Aviv Jerusalem.


 
“Those taking fibrates spent five fewer days hospital rate ICU admissions dropped 45% 8%,” Nahmias reported. patients also reduced lung inflammation.

Three generic cholesterol-lowering drugs — ubiquinone, ezetimibe rosuvastatin– found significantly reduce risk Covid-19 severity systematic analysis electronic health records led Dr. Ariel Israel, director research data Clalit Health Services.

Mining database medication purchases HMO’s 4.5 million members, Israel’s team used statistics probability tools find drugs coincidental protective effect hospitalized non-hospitalized Covid-19 patients.

“Our findings support hypothesis coronavirus hijacks cholesterol synthesis pathway boost production cellular cholesterol needs RNA virus,” Israel said.

The three generic cholesterol drugs identified “are safe widely prescribed,” said. Randomized controlled trials could prove protective effects Covid-19.

The medical records analysis also found protective effects patients taking vitamin B12, vitamin A, zinc magnesium.

 
Anti-parasite drug
Another presenter Dr. Eli Schwartz, founder Sheba Medical Center’s Center Geographic Medicine Tropical Diseases.

As ISRAEL21c reported June, Schwartz launched randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial antiparasitic drug ivermectin 100 Israelis mild moderate Covid-19.

“Ivermectin old safe drug known antiviral properties well. want see ivermectin could prevent deterioration virus shedding patients,” Schwartz said.

“Reduction viral shedding seems highly important often overlooked mild cases.A good antiviral early stage disease stop shedding therefore avoid need isolation.”

The Israeli study ongoing, meanwhile Australian study found single ivermectin treatment caused 5,000-fold reduction virus 48 hours cell culture. Bolivia Peru already approved using ivermectin Covid-19 cases.

“It’s also used prophylactically specific cases Florida Egypt prevent spread disease families,” said Schwartz.

 
“Is magic bullet false messiah? don’t know yet.”

Quickly efficiently
“Spark’s mission bring drugs quickly efficiently possible clinic,” said Prof. Dan Peer, director Spark vice president R&amp;D Tel Aviv University.

“New therapeutics diagnostics, repurposing existing drugs new entities incurable diseases save billions dollars many years development using pool thousands FDA-approved drugs.”

Peer Rogosnitzky urge governments across world create task forces focused drug repurposing.

“We able solve problem Covid-19 overcoming bureaucratic red tape financial barriers new drug development.”

They've also given anyone wants it, happens trial comes back ineffective side effects?  No, rhetorical. know answer, real answer dollar collapses thus country collapses . won’t “devalued fractions percent” entirely devalued keep printing money. Look Post WW1 Germany see needed wheelbarrow full Mark’s buy loaf bread. happen America too. live Iowa, least bit shocked see state almost entirely red. 

Our governor Kim Reynolds, rumored thought getting seat Trump cabinet. refused take steps flatten curve. used 15 million dollars supposed Covid relief implement new state website. refused join alliance several states around us wanted schedule closings/mandates/efforts concurrently help other. refused take recommendations state universities scientists recommending lockdown warned hospitals already overburdened. pulled funding free Covid testing, now, numbers time high, many get tested. People state call Covid Kim Kim Reaper. sounds funny, isn't. 

People city seem 60-70 percent adherence rate masks. local mask mandate. ask maskless idiot wearing one, say, ""The governor says police can't enforce mandate, I'm it."" 

If want know going states, look right leadership. highest state officials shrug science logic, emboldens ignorant people continue selfishness stupidity. Many us trying desperately fight own, people dense need authority figure tell do. EUA process across regulatory bodies differ much really trying harmonize rules requirements nations. Right limiting factor probably individual agencies following standard operating procedures guide exactly “approvals” taking place.

Actually Canada Stop spreading misinformation. Well fuuuuuck me, ey?  Where’s Edward Snowden need him? Georgia appear well? Lack testing? Underreporting? Actually low covid numbers??? That’s worry tho, people thinking invincible letting guard down. Still need keep social distancing mask wearing time being. Old people live among demographics interact daily normal times.

They live among much lesser extent. hard. America bad obviously east. However, population east/south east Europe tend prone conspiracy-beliefs, less willing follow government advice, larger families also gather larger family/extended family groups. Many refuse wear masks frighteningly large portion refuse take vaccine. (Corrupt Health services help either) Maybe stupid question, ask. 

Is pure capitalism prevents Pfizer/Moderna sharing vaccine J&amp;J (and others) maximize output?

 gives 5+ month (they knew serious did) head start preparing infrastructe prevent virus getting country. one America alone though. mRNA vaccines pretty severe reactogenicity covered patients understand. think giving anyone risk HCP highly irresponsible.

High reactogenicity means 2% patients get fever, soreness, muscle aches, etc. 1-2 days normal people ABSOLUTELY going insist covid vaccine gave covid. reports going harm overall vaccination rates.

The phase 3 trials vaccines were, fact, absolutely rushed inadequate reasons. herd immunity? feel like guys messing point. Old people live among demographics interact daily normal times.

Stay vigilant guys! months *hopefully* pandemic enters history books. little part disappointed isn’t ready within hours approval. Fantastic news though. believe NHS workers getting first, followed care home residents. Care home residents accounted 50% deaths- vaccinate already start seeing improvements exciting! Wish could hibernate winter til us Canadians get it! twice bad every ~5 days. (the doubling rate infections) love people prefer COVID long term effects vaccine long term effects. Where's logic that? requires one logical step. It’s easier believe bizarre conspiracies anything remotely complicated. 
I've taken four surveys thoughts vaccine also (via work, doctors office, two different studies). never know answer question whether get vaccinated.

 Fauci say safe? Trump say safe? FDA whistleblowers? countries approving using vaccine? safe age group? current health conditions make vaccine safe me? vaccine made something I'm allergic to? know answers questions, I'm confident know answers even option get shot. meantime, someone asks I'm going get coronavirus vaccine, answer maybe. 


 pro-vaccine probably get one asap even approved yet, can't make informed decision today luckily need b4 US want make $$ sick dead... cases double roughly every 3-5 days, every day cutting close making literally twice bad.

However bad today? Twice bad few. time this. slow governments starting react back March. 9 months later. takes less time make completely new human being. Yeah, triage happens regularly. Except normal times, it’s deciding things like broken arm vs head trauma. Triage means deciding critical patients gets one remaining hospital beds let alone ICU bed ventilator, literally life death decisions. wait till america wakes up

**It regions responsible ensuring residents nursing homes receive care entitled to.** [**This Prime Minister Stefan Löfven tells **.**

**He supported Emma Spak Sweden's Municipalities Regions, SKR:**

**- need go wider see applies individual homes system neglect.**

Ivo assessed one five residents nursing homes received doctor's assessment despite legal right receive one.

But small selection need go wider look looks like, according Emma Spak.

\- something regions take seriously, go wider examine whether applies individual homes system neglect.

**Stefan Löfven also says that** Sweden's regions better conditions vaccinating entire population EU countries used vaccinating ""we one vaccination-friendly populations"".

\- player greatest opportunity able carry large-scale vaccination without doubt regions, says Emma Spak.

This year, regions received two million doses vaccinate seasonal flu autumn within framework regular activities.

\- used carrying large-scale vaccinations seasonal flu. covid-19 vaccinations require different comprehensive logistics untested vaccine. bigger challenge regions.

**Therefore, collaboration initiated** least Swedish Public Health Agency, assist with, among things, purchase vaccines, information handling transport regions.

It also necessary agree distribution vaccine, groups vaccinated first take place.

\- close collaboration government Swedish Public Health Agency prerequisites regions able rig share chain good way, says Emma Spak.  I'm mate, buddy. Well personal experience tells masks work. close contact friend asymptomatic time. us wearing masks, 6 feet apart, catch it.


Really feel control great extent people start wearing masks properly. I’m healthcare worker, like Cumo say. affected first last get vaccine.

Within hospital protection: PPE ( scarce available ), screening patients visitors, rapid tests admits, specific areas hospital patients exhibiting symptoms COVID, etc. It’s fun it’s stressful, cautious. think many like learned great deal even comfortable around patients COVID positive. 

I’m excited high hopes vaccine help reduce transmission, think high risk areas deserving first line once. Ummmmm...why need data leaked document (&amp; no, haven’t looked yet)? I’ve seen awful results govt’s response Covid every single day CNN (&amp; yes, I’m asking serious question [w/only teeny bit sarcasm]])? ""everything around Atlanta sustained hotspot"" ""all cities either sustained hotspot worse"" = mostlyclear, yeah, guess Georgia mostly clear.

Seriously, look map OP areas ""low burden"" appear farms forests Google maps. Excellent bullshit calling. ,but muh freedom... Sweden's health care system decentralized. Hospitals doctors employed run regions. Nursing homes care run municipalities. state provides funding work, regions municipalities request manage budget (assets manpower too). 

Hence doctors checking patients nursing homes, either regions send municipalities allow them. case IVO seems think regions responsibility led multiple nursing homes healthcare residents prescribed general advice individual assessment. know sarcastic thing... ACTUALLY folks would adamantly anything might help atheists.

I atheist seamstress. I've making fuckton facemasks. even bought several religious-print fabric make masks.

.... Christian fish print, WWJD, Advent/Christmas prints slowest sellers since stopped making them. religious prints sold least well solid colors. never closed. Tourists everywhere. One year ago. 

""Welp looks like another Asian flu/virus, hope guys OK. Meanwhile rest us keep doing, worry global warming shit living 100% normal lives"".

An entire thought process aged like milk. gonna exciting watch UK country get back normality next months. pumped this. Relax lol supply hand also. Cuomo sends elderly people back nursing homes reason. Underestimate, possibly due doctoring. Two months ago, 300000 excess deaths US. Comparing countries undercounting covid deaths (but necessarily manage well), need multiply 1.5 likely covid related deaths, 450000 covid related deaths two months ago. Here's kicker: excess deaths people relatively healthy - elderly people death door whose demise accelerated weeks, show excess deaths period 9 months. likelihood, covid directly killed 600009 people now, us alone. That's point, though. completely unfounded wet dreams. Many European countries enforced strict mask rules yet virus kept climbing everywhere, form lockdown enacted. saw Donald Trump, said, ""The entire country Coronavirus hot spot."" he's like, ""Whatever."" (Guitar riff) still leaves 164 excess. infuriating.

Aren't religious folk asking God something??

He fucking DID. He's got doctors, nurses, entire fucking armies medical professionals asking everyone wear mask distance.

Not pray ignore ""gifts"" available solve problem.

So infuriating. think ""news"" spends much time focused Republican/Democrat divide? poor fighting other, distracted focus rich. *want* understand.

This society get encourage religion rational thinking fact never teach people distinguish fact fiction public schools. guess long-term data pretty valuable order alleviate potential doubts vaccine. However, participation receiving doses involve blood tests occasional phone calls, regard, really much effort. That's side spectrum still aspects. know getting help feels like. Apart bullshit happens there, think like 20 years India great country. Even government won't, people keep helping others. corona virus dangerous rattle snake since people can't see hear take precautions.  [This got you. Oxford take get approved, (there questions) possibility J&amp;J vaccine well. high-risk groups vaccinated, rest (""low-risk group"") easily handled hospitals needed.

Now, please get funding actually improving hospital covid protocols drug research? lying? called Dr Mengele reason... 40m 20m. Meanwhile, entirety public transportation used last 9 months two buses. Getting test ""within couple days"" good thing pub - 8am

Out pub - TBA  Yes, that's proposition absurd. right way would government forbade offer flights compensated losses incurred. Chinese game hardball game, even pandemic. smart never trusted. commonly known everywhere world cheat. always overpromise use lower quality ingredients. culture based defrauding customer. So, time, want us believe born again, like Barr telling us weeks claims fraud, 39 lawsuits Trump lost 1, sees fraud.

Dishonesty. Astra Zenica vax want. like China's, tested also Brazil. easy compare Astra Zenica percentage effectiveness China representing.

Desperate people need drug, need harmed. China would give one hoot die injured lifelong. Thanks answer! ask said drop time (obviously) mentioned, intended length indeed one year. However, dropping would mean less data them, would hate that. wondering whether events might actually make exceptions people trials, already kinda expected know yet would handled.  Restrictions still place vaccine. 100% effective all. additional deaths can't directly stopped vaccination covid ones can. It’s government secret US? 2022 might fantastic year. Complete failure national level. shutting kids, giving 10-day guideline (or 7) people believe contact COVID-19 sick person. January 2022 I’m telling people opinion believing think that’s longest expect earlier like gift. Something consider, physician...

(Oxygen Saturations Less 92% Associated Major Adverse Events Outpatients Pneumonia: Population-Based Cohort results indicate hospital admission threshold &lt;92% would safer clinically better justified."" would expected lot higher 40 percent Interesting informative read.

Mr. Big Guy “Off topic (read: conservative) political comments removed”

-Mods policies enacted mayors, governors city councils. people flouting restrictions put place. 

Also well publicized event Fauci attending sporting event seated next others without mask on. Mask form protection he's going need around ladies. Didn’t say anything dad. Said order groceries. He’s buying groceries. want pay extra $15 delivered month no. That’s him. extra $15 worth avoiding covid exposure. him. You’re hater YES! One mom's good friends physical therapist nursing home I'm overjoyed her! :D keywords ""in combination social distancing measures"". Ordinarily, one would go elementary school science fair find level research preparation.  ""She super careful, cleaned every day. take shower, clean door handles... (...) salute nursing staff, they're sick pace, can't go like anymore, they're overwhelmed."" It’s still TBD based Phase 3 data. brought meeting specifically. Nah, commute time music time, audiobook time. I'd rather commute all, I'd way rather spend hour day singing car thinking things spend hour working extra. Thanks Trump, republican representatives, republican voters. way it’s disaster US tragic laughingstock pariah. 😱 depends are. California, anyone get test, free, within couple days, get results within couple days. places shit together better others. I'm mistaken, travel 5% overall 2019. tells people drove year, rather fly. Still crazy 10mil people flew. Essential workers can't distance therefore likely non-essential workers exposed virus. Way less violent gross yet NY twice many deaths US average per capita, passed Florida hospitalizations per capita. Yet praise saint Andrew cuomo think de santis moron? probably happen, going sad does: Celebs getting vaccine early leaving us mortals significant disadvantage. US, around world. Needs week second dose build full immunity, actually 3 weeks first dose, month (but also week second dose, immediately, people still need wait). course health care workers really ""matter"" they're going change behavior hit barrier, feel successively relieved safety. Monday, Oklahoma State Department Health’s online data shows adult ICU bed availability 6%, means 51 beds. Nah... couple’a fathers do. really expected onion story. don’t blame all. want move Canada next 4yrs hopeful possible.

Glad Biden US run ground. joking plague makes bad roommate. fkn plays around shit people actually dying getting stuck lifelong effects virus?? would tell got sick vaccine available though? never took vaccine, got say, september 2021, became disabled, could easily say originally sick year earlier long term problems fully manifested. Yeah I've heard Norton give protection 29.99 month. times person check makes sense. example, worried someone might kill themself, giving call lot easier hide problem seeing them. Plus, seeing probably make feel better call Shockingly, didn‘t help all. Maybe didn‘t pray hard enough? need leaked government map look numbers. stupid article. plus pandemic, give quite people nudge needed quit. know doctor worked ER *during NYC's peak* back March, sent family away would safe, still flew country fun, hung friends, wear masks around people knows, etc. infuriating. Well, true nationalizing production something see Socialist forms government like Fascism. like US never done before. different generation emergency compared whim. people volunteered different trials - suffer bad outcomes vaccine? meanwhile, many got Covid quite severe Covid couple died Covid. taking vaccine also risk. one likes talk policies coming politicians, they're coming pubic health experts call see Anthony Faucci dining indoors I'll concerned. would joke? tell them. Jesus test long term ramifications drug shortened time?  would give award poor. Grim statement, so, true. Folks (purposely) conflate anti-vaxxers anti-mandatory-vaxxers. we'll lot less people comorbidities, voluntarily chose them, others unlucky.

It's unlucky earthquake building fall too, 

the herd healthier, die Didn’t OK statement relying prayer? think Dr. Fauci get honorary first shot. He's worked hard pandemic. Testing issue Texas panhandle (north Amarillo). Easy get day test hospital. CVS offers testing waits locally. Rapid PCR tests available two neighboring hospitals w/ Doctor order. 

Most urgent cares FIA test, too. Oklahoma, Governor Stitt calls day prayer fasting. mask mandate. Positive asymptomatic Healthcare workers get back work. impact population density spread COVID-19 (or disease) negligible most. densest places entire world, eastern Asia western central Europe, best, sparsely populated places countries like US worst; even US many densely populated cities better many areas. real world, covid (or disease) spreads based 2 factors: policy cultural attitudes/practices (which actually drives policy). sound nuts all, I'd same. nearly died flu before, ain't fucking covid. don’t need that.

We put bodies town square every shift.

No hiding it. 

Make visible.

People somehow need see it, make see it.

Or make illegal hospitals provide care doesn’t conform normal times.

No half assed PPE, proper gear working.

No double shifts, 36-40 hr/week nurses snd techs, 40-60 hr/week doctors.

No stretched nurse patient ratios.

If population wants act pre-pandemic, healthcare act kind.

The doctors nurses country beat raw one else cares.

Once bodies start piling someone something. I'm sure love nephew much, understand even wearing mask enough keep safe. stop seeing people altogether stop around you. Covid Covid Covid. talk Covid ! Hey... chose drink kool aid. Wife 1b pregnant, anybody know pregnant women vaccinated pfizer moderna ones? theory seems yes (based mRna vaccines work). they. Canada top (bad) quartile deaths adjusted population. consider general health population, low population density, ready access healthcare, terrible result Canadians shouls appalled by. guess coming around finally, stuff poll

Absolutely, going get worse honestly. link isn’t working article still there. Weird link worked previously So, flip it, charge everyone surcharge give discount vaccination. happens right things like biometric screening, certain numbers range, getting certain number steps per day, etc. Looking hardest hit states wonder herd immunity already starting effect. North South Dakota seen cases going despite nothing try stop spread. 10% confirmed infected could easily mean 50% actually infected. weird time living in. implications follow questions. compare South Dakota New Zealand? comparable. state basically charge management control spread virus. course variables state cannot control possible make comparisons. also possible compare states smaller nations. I'm sure arguing. Facebook private company I'm happy handling fake news, permanently deleted Facebook account. value free speech comes defense people spread lies. Facebook exist all, doubt things would bad right now. Sometimes wish Doctors Nurses would quit, see would happen.

Some are. going get worse, really. they? Price higher what? Maybe depends testing site. got PCR twice, Monday Thanksgiving, got results next DAY times

I heard others whose results taken days I’ll never understand Oklahoma. I’ve tried. I'm sure somehow essential workers... Lockdown Party??? forced inoculation. Yes, sure Wisconsin Dakota's deep maroon color, Covid infected Minnesota surrounded

Yes vaccinated protected 3 weeks time. really give fuck anything anymore. wanted godless world... get make mandatory, security guard hospital, mandatory employees get flu shot. didn’t know thing. think would something would look into? I’m surprised travel bans still effect, point might even make difference all. low concern euphemism low priority. Sadly, folks likely super spreaders least likely voluntarily get vaccinated. factored think might see greater prevention death targeting vulnerable populations. vaccine 50s adverse effects. Ahhh meant refuse entry people aren’t wearing mask. wording pretty bad there. still rather unbelievable me.

What’s crazy? sons stepmom due baby soon. taking zero precautions worries me. also child horrible immune system, gets sick time, still aren’t careful. It’s going take death close family member friend hit home them. even then. 

Stat safe. appreciate part. FIL kept Sweden BS argument summer. Never could figure gets news. people see shoreline instead rationing food last days journey jumped ship started swimming. phase three Pfizer trial alone 43,000 participants November. believe order submit EUA needed two months post vaccine safety data  have, think right choice. Ask anything grew town live 15 minutes away. sad situation. Fox News always focused stupid trivial issues comes Democrats. Remember Umbrella Gate?  Yeah, maybe Sky Daddy help y'all pray more! America still running around panic wondering band-aids are. honestly think there's lots reasons could occur. really satisfactory? No, probably not.

However something nation consider community that's well sits one two peoples shoulders there's problems hand.

What retired, car accident, changes careers, moves across country, decides fuck figure themselves.

Honestly way Healthcare professionals worked, overworked, lot ways disregarded populace we're lucky mass strike God help us was.

These people physical emotional punching bags country's worth feelings. deserve this, I'd argue sign it. We're lucky they've stepped plate sacrificed much have. cause everyone nyc already died left town? Put bandaids tape ridge nose prevent air escaping Meh. probably best look, SF voter take cardinal sin either. Indoor dining thing SF Napa counties time, assume parties drove (SF Yountville 1.5 hours car).

It's fair upset type restaurant (well people's price range) really relationship much health guideline violation was, me. talking county tho. reason vaccines take long funding usually doesn’t come quickly. addition, usually takes forever test efficacy exposure disease. Here, problem covid pandemic spreads easily. 

Those two biggest hindrances vaccine development. addition, lot groundwork laid previous coronavirus vaccine attempts (not covid 19). Sure. Minnesota Ontario, two randomly picked. Minnesota population 5.6 million, 3,549 new cases today, 11% positive. Ontario population 14.6 million, 1,707 new cases, 5% positive. Short trip Gavin Newsom, Chris Cuomo, London Breed, etc., healthy people 40s 50s, isn't. That's true even Joe Blow Kentucky.


Tell young people who've died it. still admission leaders, actions, think virus big deal.

Again, access best health care money buy. mention testing rest us cannot get easily. Weird ignored part though. 

But please, continue selfish helping kill Americans. Good riddance. I'm looking forward China world's foremost superpower, American Imperialism going far, far long already. pictured Hamilton’s Washington intro lol people states restrictions catching virus, given ostensible effectiveness restrictions? Texas resident, sick, fever, can't breathe last December entire Christmas, thinking maybe got covid last year. Fauci said people covid vaccinated. Haha cool, it’s good guess! celebrate April? Everyone dressed pretending matter. Tragic. data website known Wow. proportion New Yorkers knew someone died COVID-19 back June. 3 weeks ago got tested last, 3-day appointment schedule, line all. test 2 weeks that, day, wait.

We positive test house, lot isolation testing. Well hope mom us MILs covid one done. don’t think us know helps immunity, I’m sure hoping does. Well there's new stimulus bill that's going congressional debate U.S., currently individual stimulus checks - could line item idea incentive. Get jabbed, get check. swear BOB; y’all better forget cleaning staff. work restaurant. count frontline worker? like old motto ""C's get degrees"". Anything 70% bad. Regular flu..? Inslee spectacular job. shut everything early kept way, despite first cases US, Washington state serious increase (and nowhere near bad states).

WA stayed hospital capacity, brought mediators negotiate end nursing strike first case COVID showed up, hospitals neighboring states flying sick WA difference capacity stark.

If anyone followed lead early on, odds good states would done better. fact people things know wrong mean really believe things wrong, means human.

That's probably concise way saying trying express. ""PS: clear absolutely 100% calling politicians this. supposed lead example seems like half governors untold mayors caught breaking rules. People every right pissed that.""

100% agree this. However bring interesting question whether expect ""leaders"" 100% perfectly faultless not. I'd presume rational people would agree that's realistic thing expect,. leaves us question ""where draw line"" (or say:.. ""How many mistakes per year celebrity/leader get.. ?)

I know answer that. count five countries: USA, UK, Germany, China, Russia. countries vaccine origin story? shit test number days since exposure, believe almost back baseline risk (I.e. excluding exposure). isolate 3 4 days wouldn’t get another test. map surprises me, focused state even think bigger. Where? Here's CO there's testing over, finnaly got able lots tests month ago want know prolonging this

Zuckerberg: care, get money. 

It matter read this. Yea American's bad evil 'fuck bad US is"" Political pandemic bull shit 2 days thanksgiving 

Just got home covid testing based 3 hours stood outside PPE cold swabbing 200 people quite literally coughing face map representative what’s happening 5 days post thanksgiving knew avoid getting covid months prepare!

I'm going need popcorn see flight/travel traffic like xmas thanksgiving results week two

By way, turns states legal requirement follow rules/guidelines elderly highest risk get vax december, rich famous buy shots early. Certainly entire sports teams get grandma exactly military going staff hospital? Thanks specific information. 

Germany also isolated positive cases hospital whether patient symptoms not, bad symptoms were.  It’s Germany deaths earlier year, also found ‘happy hypoxia’ covid19. wonder Germany still Europe’s second spike? *Johnson &amp; Johnson Bum Bum Vaccine* didn’t to, it’s certified lost lol hospital specific get tested covid. specific covid floors ER.

This would disrupt people's belief system admit wrong things level disturbing. 

''the state inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, especially relating behavioral decisions attitude change.''

\*What example cognitive dissonance?

**Cognitive dissonance** refers situation involving conflicting attitudes, beliefs behaviors. **example**, people smoke (behavior) know smoking causes cancer (**cognition**), state **cognitive dissonance**. Honest answer:.. think I'm comfortable capable answering question.. know person intimately enough willing ""jump conclusions"" there's way know various factors variables influences caused make choice. ""I mean rude, many examples need public officials openly flouting rules conclude take virus seriously?""

It depends context situation. 

* saw 1 person make 1 mistake.. I'm probably gonna give benefit doubt. 

* see 1 person making (extremely unsafe) mistake 10 20 times day.. repeatedly days weeks end.. yeah.. I'm probably going stop listening look sources info. shit 4 years, Biden barely won, reinforcing failed policies led Trump. Bahahahahahaha, tiny fingers. 😁 don’t know translation bot doesn’t show time. think read tea leaves bit. policies paper read doesn’t include nuances leader provides equation. Biden wants people “unite” around mitigation efforts; Trump opposite. great plan paper, leader cannot get team (population) execute it, fucking useless. think plays caring/not caring note. Sometimes caring push population comfort zone execute big plans get done. know South Dakota, Kentucky even drive-through liquor stores. Good hear! Albany Syracuse? can't believe putting stimulus.

I think stimulus happen Biden gets maybe time decide something like this. Vitamin fat soluble taking much cause problems. removed medical advice - people need consult doctors, random people internet.

 That's stupid reasoning. There's huge difference saying ""take vitamin D"" saying ""take 10000IU vitamin 3 times day"".  logic, can't even suggest someone drinks water, drinking much water kill. I've made habit count amount people wearing masks given store, including people nose normally count 30-40 different people. crazy many people chin-strap masks walking around HEB can't back I'm checkout line. Like I'm trying buy groceries, let distance want please is. Well, there's nothing stopping committee Congress get Jordan oath. Go call one wrestlers too, already gave sworn affidavit Jordan made aware doctors behavior. One gonna lying think guy 20,30 years removed college position power. gains nothing telling truth Jordan. Jordan every incentive dishonest. it? I've worked hospitals long time never mandatory. opt wear mask building shit enforced. I'm mandatory also understand slippery slope argument poses. Wearing masks issue. lack social distancing.

People still see friends indoors. take masks get togethers people trust. That's problem. regret it? seen anything effect. last thing I've read, understand herd immunity thing work planned. seen official statement far would acknowledge took wrong approach. Good them. curiosity, envisage virus naturally disappearing? Shhhh, Reddit can’t circle jerk Maybe anything, cause harm. Rn can't know vaccine immunity lasts longer natural immunity. that's Timor, thinking Spanish men. ""WhY dOnT MoVe?"" - dumbass reddit users touch reality Early pandemic FL governor ran mouth awesome FL COVID concern. also made fun NY people dying NYC. think people angry every article hates FL gets voted. No, it’s like flu vaccination, injection muscle never mentioned focus group 1a. said, CDC working major pharmacies provide vaccine onsite long term care facilities. may take approach teachers. thought already known..? Thanks clarification.. definitely helping put ease. seen article J&amp;J's consent form said “If received placebo, may offered study vaccine cost study vaccine shown safe works, possible may occur 2 years vaccination,” J&amp;J document reads.  “This determined consultation national health authorities country”  
From [this .. also says FDA wants keep trials blind long possible. 

So suppose gotten bogged wording, saying may take 2 years approved, would LEAST 2 years placebo group could vaccinated. (I gotten bit concerned blood test followups 2 years.) comment chain made visceral much user name person, lot pain around us hiding numbers maps.

I knew things intellectual level before, made visceral. two three weeks Thanksgiving travel cases shows up. would argue particular physician deserves condemnation coming way. legitimate reason choosing travel air October, would mentioned article. said getting virus “a wake call” regarding precautions like wearing mask. Dr. Kurt Papenfus arrogant, selfish stupid. would want anyone like treating me, especially emergent situation.

I’d argue Dr. Kurt Papenfus go fuck smug grinning face. It’s tracker consistently updated.

The original date tracker published august. ""It is"" leaked reason. data still produced employees services place pandemic. likely would swept carpet ""Operation Ignore"" could continue. would like say intention degrading opinion, I'd rather understand vote.
Your response covid really relying opinion &amp; personal view ""weak"" may be.

Deamming others &amp; devaluing human life outlook try understand.
Just help us understand coming from, let's discuss this. 

Viruses existed before... 
Why feel though able go life bc ""u"" effected life... yet. (Hopefully never) one knows. 

So weak you? Fauci says people vaccinated then. Hopefully includes children older 12, studied right now. fingers crossed Leaked? knowing shit everywhere missed 4) false positives, 5) asymptomatic all, symptoms month earlier still shedding PCR-positive, either infected point false positive result. 

PCR detect non-infectious viral fragments. Sick Covid could correction evolution seeking ? Tell young people who've died it.

45 kids age 5, 42 kids 5-14, 428 15-24. unfortunately smaller number excess suicides 25s please, continue selfish helping kill Americans.

My argument leaders enforcing policies deed believe virus big deal. either selfishness killing Americans?

Also bizarre feature argument illusory selfishness morally condemned cheering death innocents elevating totalitarian regime engages ethnic cleansing (and source virus discussion) desirable. writing erotic corona fan-fic spare time? South Dakota Conference United Church Christ issued public plea Gov. Kristi Noem put statewide mask mandate “shared, unanimous alarm COVID-19 rates South Dakota neighboring states,” Conference board directors sent letter directly Noem media outlets, said Brigit Stevens, executive conference minister South Dakota United Church Christ. Leaked government map shows sky blue grass green. French Laundry well price range, former chef, it’s also bucket list. Good point actually useful traveling within Northeast states state versions. I've using COVID-19 NJ App day released includes family essential travels Pennsylvania New York State.  Security Officer, would verify im essential worker time comes? must live like 5% country lmfao dawn? Wouldn’t liquid soap do? *Anti masker says loud* ""It's weak, fat old people dying""!

*Then head,* ""I'm young enough strong enough survive, care*""* ! mean, live Tennessee I've 3 free tests. one July took either 4 5 days. others within 48 hours. That's said got removed, maybe could said bit tactfully. people think go exact age range 50-60, especially one severe comorbidities causing Covid take range down. Despite fact could easily live another decade comorbidities managed like diabetes, asthma hypertension manage (which millions upon millions successfully manage keep diseases control even 80's). Man, passed small kidney stone today too. years since one usually land ER. terrified I'd go ER today. can't believe state live right now! Yeah, consider one best qualities really cheap tastes. I've never Michelin star restaurant, I'm almost certain able tell difference. anything would probably dislike it. Nah it’s late. There’s stopping reckon. 28 days later? think documentary something that... Every state people agree restrictions. drive nearby states restrictions order eat out, go bars etc. Lots people N. Illinois driving Wisconsin instance. governor declared day prayer fasting. Instead mask mandate curfews shutdowns reduce transmission risk. What's Georgia? idea they're well State? blind luck? Ok thanks! Source? like ideology behind early 2000s super villain Fur shurr B Source bullshit stats?

[That would rest unhinged rant, guess another piece evidence obsessive Western self-hatred quickly becomes punishment. God damn missed pun. obvious people taking seriously (or seriously enough) likely getting vaccine. Antimaskers antivaxxers one same. smoking example bad one. Unless implying smokers think get sick despite knowing will. recently caught strep throat. doctor see right away urgent care closed left going ER. two weeks ago. crowded treating people waiting room. certain going catch covid. gave shot ass hallway cameras another sick guy treated. told close eyes. Like real...shit getting hand. already [replied [all sub exactly prevent panic, course. want people negatively affecting macroeconomy false news fueled emotion. think anyone else. Plain simple. Nononono. Sports schools nothing spreading covid. Kids spread covid. plz make Birth, hands down. Kidney stones suck. know colleague mine spent 12 hours car w/ 4 people. Nobody wearing mask. tested positive, nobody else car did. No...If COVID take 14 days kick in. made backlog. Tomorrow could even worse. can't people think serious least understand aspect ?

A lot rural areas still understanding effects they're still shipping patients urban areas like always have, nobody thinks *they'll* need hospital care next 2-3 months. think missed broke today well. Add San Jose mayor list.  mother always uses “they say....”. reply is, “who they?” admits “they” always Facebook. fact can't post single source back laughable claims means even know lying. Mike tyson now? Mike prime lived good life. handful time. think Zoom Oscars could actually interesting traditional format. fun seeing people's houses. minds think people want watch two nights Oscar coverage. myself, kidney stones sharp pain stop stone passed, could days weeks. Migraines, mine least, vary dull 'scoop insides spoon make pain go away' last days, would put level pain. I've also given birth tell first hand kidney stones hurt worse unmedicated plus pitocin birth. think still worried US citizens traveling outside country. Asked every medical appointment. Crazy. difference make? Yay. great news. source interactive tool built MIT informative interesting tinker There’s Canadians desperately trying copy Americans. They’re pretty good job it. still objectively better Trump/Republicans way. due respect you, would stop ""knowing"" person possible... pretty obvious? Fewer people got tested Thanksgiving holiday. thing watch next week two see effects caused holiday gatherings. Ah fun knowing local hospital max capacity started reporting anti-mask stuff promoting self harm. might work. grandma diagnosed terminal cancer three months ago. She’s rushed hospital twice last week times she’s wait 10 hours bed open her. nurses said ER patients less life-threatening illnesses waiting 24-36 hours bed open. imagine waiting 36 hours admitted hospital care? get oxygen low? thought 80% really bad.  sent letter asking participate, idea selected. stupid clickbait article... media weren’t profit, maybe there’d level ethical guidelines? Lol God. know exactly feel. move people don’t care virus all. 50 don’t best health. stayed room two weeks heard exposed. time left use bathroom. wore mask sprayed bathroom Lysol. got mad me. Wtf. trying offensive don’t want die. 

I sorry situation. best keep mask room abd get Lysol. can. hard time finding it. got two bottles. Alcohol even bleach. Make bleach spray. Look online much mix water. Even peroxide mixed certain amount water help. look online. Good luck you. ❤️ doesn't. Johns Hopkins, NY Times, many sources publishing public free dashboards maps daily.

But ""leaked govt documents"" draws lot clicks attention ""publicly available since March"" guess know value anyone older health problems, sure. That's sheltered obviously uncommon. I'm sure GM retool Chevy Malibu assembly line produce mRNA even easier ventilators N95 masks. /s trained top work full capacity..... fully staffed fully supplied.

Hospitals USA like cut corners neither fully staffed supplied part training containing spread..... means masks,distancing national mandates.

So person know talking ass based *should* done actually happened. Arrest them. Try them. Punish them. link not. example, New York state test much neighboring Quebec per capita. days 200K tests. Quebec number tests done around 35-33K population 8.5 York City similar population, yet least twice many people tested Good! wanted preface im antivaxxer anything!! Thanks info, im glad amazing potential new MRNA type vaccines!! Curious next generation vaccines go MRNA based ones! right.

That objectively better Trump/Republicans way. guess better question moment would be...

Are healthy? healthy? weak? tell infecting certain %... really? 

It me. could race around world foot, questions asked. least amount body fat could possibly have. 20/20 vision, broken bones surgeries. 1 21yr healthy child known allergies health conditions. Neither us taken antibiotics 10 years... know of. 

So what's healthy? What's weak? Speaking immunity, even known long vaccine work? Like, going annual thing? There's accounting taste, say. Yep live Cornwall see types damn time. Cornwall economically depressed blue collar, get share ""I'm racist but"" covid garbage. good resources looking hospital capacity / icu beds? Nah, she’s disgusting joke hypocrite. Wanted vivid image. Fuck. breaks heart... Going vegan likely increases risk around would need constantly pull mask tell everyone within shouting distance vegan. frequent poster r/kidneystones recommend get muscle relaxer. Baclofen advised others use No-Spa, get Ebay. using 3 decades, life saver. I'm South Dakota, Sioux falls. go Walgreens get test right second free results 4 days. hope bring criminal charges held responsible like Holyoke Soldier's Home Holyoke, Massachusetts 76 people died. Members family dead. return, since reached point yet? get return pain anger? know plenty fat vegans. low quality material Probably going xmas new years time thanksgiving bump really starts show itself. 

Which bad, people going think Thanksgiving cause big bump get together xmas, double whammy. 

By time Biden takes office, really seeing effects people traveling getting together holidays. thanks sharing! Suspenders? Guess heard social contract. empathetic caring others. 

Also, money pay people stay home. members society would rather prop failing businesses instead people though. Sure, attenuated vaccine properly attenuated, kids given actual polio. adverse effects seen within days. I'm saying never chance adverse effects. I'm saying things happen quickly. months, something happen would have. issues 10 years later sudden problems realistic mRNA vaccine. know help.

I 37, worked entire shutdown. Working telecoms considered essential, without phones internet business impossible. 

I finally caught COVID sucks. think life threatening me, but, SUCKS. 103 temp, 90% osat. flu 2-3 times worse. want over. want go work.

Stay safe, stay clear. wish anyone. Symptoms start showing days, sometimes week two fact. Mark words, we'll 250K new cases next days. almost wonder chose color bad covid areas blue, would done contain it?

Can't possibly let country turn blue... Ruth Chris thank much happen possess penis know worse. yeah, get worse night 

Flomax + saline drip wide fuck open + Dilaudid easiest time had, could get set fire feel shit Dilaudid board *pretends shocked* paramedic. Municipal, private. I'm pretty sure first wave vaccines work, honestly, think privates get fast. med control doctor awesome could see trying get privates, least ALS side earth think point return is? Return what? quarter million people dead. like 9/11 every week. can't mask mandates beca they're ""not proven help"". day prayer? Easily proven work. /s yea, thinking atm. think May 2021 Massachusetts/Boston area conducive. Especially HS 2021 seniors vs. college ones. miss prom graduation start college without HS closure, esp. since lost midway thru junior year. CDC APIC puts EMS 1a. first responders 1b. wife unknowingly worked close proximity someone COVID solid week. wore masks, 3 weeks later wife still signs COVID. Masks work.  Anyone Else #Anti Vaccine / Maybe Scared / Concerned 🤣🤔

Just Wanting Wait Ah Year 2 
Too See Everyone Else ?? 😂 Side Effect Wise , 

 Get Ever Get Flu Shots Due Anxiety , Guess One Serious ? 3 Positive Covid Test Back June , Multiple Negative Since , Mid 20's Slight High Risk ( High Bp , Pots , ) Recovered Well , . Good luck finding common sense Spain. one read headline Doctor called mandatory mask law... "" thought episode predicted this? hard compare states provinces even other, detection testing different often inconsistent. One thing clear - cases skyrocketing past days Ontario Quebec. growing. issue absolute numbers, trajectory/trends. Even Ontario much better Minnessota clear opening border safety measures place (say, require negative Covid test done past 3 days, allow rapid test upon arrival airport) would increase risk Ontario beyond current pandemic levels. suggesting opening allowing anyone cross. keeping border completely shut business leisure travel think wrong. first reaction too. would Fauci waste time psychopath? kids age 5, 42 kids 5-14, 428 15-24. 

Source bullshit stats? unfortunately smaller number excess suicides 25s year.

Yeah, sucks country half ass job fighting disease tells people stay home also provides material support so, therefore forcing choose destitution endangering lives loved ones. goes show c*pitalism work. argument leaders enforcing policies deed believe virus big deal. 

Yes, understand lies. That's pointed they're concerned access best health care testing. keep ignoring destroys bullshit narrative. either selfishness killing Americans?

Dumb r*ght wingers tr*mp cultists think virus big deal, US 260k deaths, could've prevented taken seriously. hard, sweety. bizarre feature argument illusory selfishness morally condemned cheering death innocents


I want Am*rica end. expect brainwashed Am*ricans elevating totalitarian regime engages ethnic cleansing (and source virus discussion) desirable.

Well true point. new version Ir*qi WMDs. provide sources like undo indoctrination. know far gone that. Continue private practice. bet YouTube membership tanks.

Unfortunately, doubt will. people going hear this; ignores it, vast majority people going forget months. There’s backlog paperwork holidays. tens thousands doctors field medics. laughed. took good news got caught. mean yes, Tens thousands people COVID previously survivable conditions die. No, open up. Money come thin air. Europe going shitter many moved us tax reasons. Humans social animals, stop interfering lives. Wear hazmat suit, health responsibility? obvious Newsom typical politician when, political pressure, went back word reduce vaccination exemptions couple years ago. needs go. Hence, United States impeachment equivalent indictment criminal law; essentially statement charges official.

One many passages impeachment bringing charges official. get impeach like policy. steadily leaving planet behind, friend

when return welcome Yeah, slight fever (100F), headache, muscle ache. Yes, commercially approved vaccine available you, wouldn’t problem drop out. stay trial j&amp;j vaccine approved, likely early 2021, hope j&amp;j vaccinate volunteers. Pfizer said would do, hope j&amp;j/Moderna/AZ follow suit. Antibody test tell you’ve Covid past. don’t know accurate difficult get age breakdowns car accidents. However, vast majority deaths cars would people under, say, 60 (older people may pro-rata accidents lower speeds meaning less pro-rata deaths. also drive less). hand, vast majority Covid deaths aged 55.

So number comparing 36,560 versus 3% 276,976 8309. number approximate rough make point. Car accidents affect young four times Covid.

 think need get bit perspective here. study results starting counting 7 days second dose. point consider maximum immunity vaccine give you. 

That said, *in theory* body starting produce train antibodies day get first shot, like light switch labelled ""immunity"" gets flipped one week second dose, dimmer dial gets slowly turned moment get first vaccine, although I'm qualified speculate speed dial turns. Yes. Pfizer Moderna second shot day 22 29 first shot. sure J&amp;J A-Z same. getting annoying see misleading info everywhere. husband works healthcare company meeting last week told frontline workers getting mid-January, that's nothing goes wrong. happen Lakepoint would you? every time cover Covid patients y'all definitely protocols mask processing BUMC does. Masks could sexual freakaleakathon want update us cut ties moron. said serious serious! /s I'm afraid going big problem. Today's anti-maskers tomorrow's anti-vaxxers. Take Zinc Quercetin. get 2 days Amazon. Conservative people vapid. Grandma died Jesus... interest getting vaccine fire department work Michigan. split along political lines. Big surprise.

We told could expect first round late December. Lightfoot mayor chicago Midwest. really going blame sturgis, 4 months ago, Illinois' nation leading spike, mass celebrations streets, 4 weeks ago? Anders Tegnell never acknowledge he's doing/done right fault. rest country starting understand plan working, taboo say before. army doctors medics aren’t sitting around twiddling thumbs. lot work VA hospitals such.

Personally, National Guard absolute lifesaver testing center. army helping, may see it. convenient Well done, Hawaii That's true. \~3% New York infected Covid. That's near heard immunity.

Canadians love stereotype. love complain loud Americans I'm surrounded loudmouth Canadians workplace (warehouse)

Sorry negative experiences Interesting isn’t quite word I’d use.

A lot already it. Sometimes we’ll see evidence bronchiolitis like respiratory viral illness it’s unheard (called post-viral syndrome). Basically, means continuing inflammation/scarring small hair ways leading air sacs. Unfortunately, effective treatment lung transplantation severe cases, done. prognosis unclear people improve, people don’t. 
The virus cause organ damage though, could lead shortness breath. heart inflamed reduced functional capacity may occur. people get debilitate illness muscle strength diminished. actually require many many muscles diaphragm breathe efficiently (chest wall, abdominal, neck, back muscles). Interesting, know that, thank information. know voluntary is? always thought problem West requiring isolation might cause people under-report symptoms avoid testing.

Source? might need upgrade hot*spot* something bigger Hey lots green percent change that's good. Based post Gazette.

Those 116 notified 294 people uploaded unique, six-digit number state case investigator given called people tested positive COVID-19.


Only 116 people notified covid like 600k people downloaded app. number skyrocket enough time passed antibodies dwindle. once, agree Tories. I'm sorry population density confusing understand :(

But thanks broadcasting ignorance nobody takes anything say seriously. Finally country handling pandemic way everybody expected Avast free, bro. Sorry can’t forget California lawmakers took trip Hawaii conference everyone else asked stay home.  No, latest data HHS, provided weekly. going believe HHS website, know tell you. live Cornwall, Ontario see confederate flags share Trump bumper stickers.

Care guess kind vehicle on? months. would say barking wrong tree I'm convinced even tree barking at. “After there’s vaccine widespread distribution it’s going magically go away!! scam!” /s already irreversible calamity? Many states already projecting run ICU bed space MONTH aren’t even factoring near certain surge holiday cases.

If national lockdown implemented conjunction business personal income support least two months could arrest spread disease. could reallocate resources states yet overwhelmed save many lives possible. 

But states whose healthcare systems become overwhelmed slimmer chance option working. use option 100% correct irreversible calamity. Wait women get kidney stones.. know that. curiosity hole passed through? fucking narcissistic psychopath

FTFY calling see it. Coachella? push May, that's sounding probable. Trump Republicans betrayed everybody America. maybe re-open sport stadiums open space put hospital nursing home people since stupid dumb build new ones. I’m guessing another shutdown happens? get majority hospitals back control. is, uh, technically accurate maybe bit reductionist?

I found [this article outlining play-by-play.

I think biggest one whether effectively lead Congress assist economic relief—he says will, can't wave magic wand. effective, would eliminate big excuse many state governments leaning leaving everything wide open. 91/92 would often hit manual labor 13000 feet (ski job). absolutely feel difference that, 94/5 would usually rest altitude 99 usually read sea level. best scary situation. feel paranoia, maybe take break sub bit, lol. stop listening following 'Fauci'. least rational caring.

Hang there. vaccine coming! Wonder one person voted prioritizing healthcare workers nursing homes is...and thinking. Hi, Vsauce!

Michael here. Obligatory fuck Scotty smirking misogynist Marketing. issue HHS data, I'd suggest writing letting know concerns. suggest read alleviate concerns. thought already obvious swingers' convention? unfortunate ones worsening society also ones resources higher chances survival get covid. Completely unsurprising given absolutely shitty Federal response ""let's pretend exist."" saying right? Yikes! I'm well now. I've boot since Nov 5th chip fracture require surgery. six weeks boot/unable enjoy autumn fullest really sucked though! numbers nationwide surveys like 35% nurses plan get vaccine, 35% don't, 30% unsure.  nobody fuckin trusts thing.  well said true. never underestimate willingly freely people move goalposts team wins. like suggesting finally time Andre giant quit wrestling? issue people understand vaccine approval process. think vaccine approvals typically take years, must mean rushed. 

The nature global pandemic makes much easier conduct vaccine trials, get results quickly. 

For example, recent approved vaccines HPV vaccine. get approval, needed give bunch non-sexually active kids, wait become sexually active, wait bunch get HPV (which average people get they've partners). *course* took years. (To say nothing convincing adults let doctors give tweens trial vaccine STD - think took little while?)

With thousands new cases COVID day, easy find people volunteer trial, lots people got exposed virus, meaning statistical data needed even two-months safety window finished. What’s wrong question? Lead paint, lead gasoline, air pollution hell combo. FWIW, testing overrated. Like home pregnancy test, test valid for, like, 3 day window. early get false negative, late already got it. Testing tracking spread, preventing it.

Limiting contact really effective move. asymptomatic, get test anyway. got symptoms, late. assume it, self isolate, warn anyone touch with. Testing everyone time impractical, help anyway. Limit contact, isolate sick. city, symptomatic get tested, wait 2 hrs car clinic room ready, wait 4-7 days results. Unless healthcare worker. mom nursing home nurse tested weekly rapid results test. Negative far! IDK. Oxford vaccine ends working better initial half-dose, could end widely used long run, since less expensive need special refrigeration. covid becomes something endemic vaccine something needs tweaked like flu vaccine, first past post 2020 matter much. know slightly pisses off? watching everyone summer/fall wearing masks around town covid control masks on. control assholes summer/fall. hate break - there's much prevention done like wild fire. [Tegnell admits herd immunity approach futile posted several days ago mods removed it. news?

I'm minimizing cost lives. I'm referring point government action, government action, longer sufficient stop exponential spread disease, prevent hospital closures, avoid seeing significantly higher mortality rate there's simply way help patients show once.

And really time prevent occurring because, said, already occurring places. need stop occurring every place time. That's nuclear scenario must avoided costs. That's society becomes stretched breaking point.

That’s laws all. pisses misuse term. think term ""Herd Immunity"" means become immune enough people get it. That's works all. Herd Immunity, understand it, reach say 70% vaccination (immunity) far less people get large portion immune spread it, thus *effectively* passing immunity ""herd"". unvaccinated people actually become immune, lower chance get safe. article changed title. Look URL path. New Zealand gets 20 million+ arrivals country every year. tourists travel Covid something based passport might carry.

Isnt half reason US fucked argument covid spread travelers only? spread community community. thats handled New Zealand.

It's obviously wrong. Nobody irreplaceable. problem way health care system setup. many reasons could've become unable work. reasonable expect individual infallible.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Whenever get vaccinated sit down, look way tell nurse ""just keep talking finished without telling please"". works pretty well. 64 million coronacirus infections. ""few hundred"" (let's say 400) reinfections represents 0.0006%. much chance winning lottery. Highly unlikely EU change process Boris lies Brexit. think important message delivers messaging. leaders top singing song, people going go along it. certainly people could swayed effective communication targeted them, reality making people something believe choice incredibly difficult. like imagining doctor telling kid take vitamin parent sitting back shaking head chomping cupcake. really expect kid listen Doctor? Calling someone fool tin-hat-man roundabout way calling liar. no, directly call liar definitely insinuated. read comments above, answer questions ;) get back work business hope wonderful day. discovered water wet

Some health authorities acts like internet explorer (?) never said can't get vaccine. said I'm comfortable idea taking one rushed nobody knows long term effects are.

I never said social distancing ""too hard"" like reaching record levels US

For worth, I'm American Risky Clicks Conspiracy Chicks. 

amirite Whatever say bro Well medical busses 
Put beds wall drive speed nurses attending get coming can't wait parents get vaccine. We're careful I'll sleep lot better they're vaccinated. Hmm, need research that, honestly thought Hungarians pro-vaccines (atleast socialise, almost everyone took it). Thanks sorry. Good thing dont love anyone age 40. /s obviously We've never developed coronavirus vaccine never sort immense pressure so. coronaviruses harmless. SARS MERS obviously ended fairly well contained we've never poured resources vaccine development either. SARS-CoV-2 different impactful virus since 1918 Well, crap comment removed.

And thank you, kind stranger. PCR tests cheaper, results come back fast enough would've risked getting fired take much time work.

PCR free Georgia, employer sued firing someone taking leave exposure corona Vaccines cause magical damage body shows years later. vaccine rapidly cleared system, anything happens due immune response stimulates. autoimmune conditions appear within 2 months show all.

The millions health care workers get vaccinated mid-Dec/mid-Jan going large ""phase 4"" trial mid-March we'll known serious side effects show up.

And speaking living extreme fear, there's lot extreme fear vaccine people looked kinds long term side effects vaccines actually produce. offer argument done quickly inherently done sloppily like guarantees probability side effects (which apparently worse long-term damage COVID cause). living much fear unknown COVID seen preferable risk. mean sure, care parents grandparents sound advice. really think us choose heed caution living fear?

This doctor took selfie show gravity pandemic. it’s used deny it

By Associated PressDec. 2, 20204:04 AM
A photo hospital’s alternative care site Nevada misrepresented social media — including President Trump — fuel false notion COVID-19 pandemic hoax even cases surge state.

Renown Regional Medical Center primary target renewed conspiracy theories online suggesting hospitals empty coronavirus dangerous top medical experts say is. hospital opened alternative care site two floors supplemental hospital beds inside parking structure Nov. 12 accommodate overflow COVID-19 cases needed.

But social media using photo allege pandemic exaggerated hoax.

Trump amplified false claim Tuesday, retweeting photo 80 million followers. “Fake election results Nevada, also!” wrote.

Early pandemic, photos empty hospital waiting rooms spread online falsely suggest coronavirus hoax. Hospital officials responded explaining lack people public areas reflected new procedures protect patients staff limiting visitors minimizing shared waiting spaces. apologise glib seriously though, kind anger probably helpful anyone. hell smoke dude lol 🎼We vaccine high life doors covid closed open again🎼 fellow Coloradan, sending best wishes complete recovery possible. Thank much sir, answer looking for. Speaking reporters Tuesday, Gov. Jared Polis forcefully denied criticism Colorado’s plan prioritizing allocation coronavirus vaccines place incarcerated individuals ahead healthy older Coloradans.

“That won’t happen,” Polis said. “There’s way prisoners going get members vulnerable population . … There’s way it’s going go prisoners goes people haven’t committed crime. That’s obvious. false.” I-O  real ""fuck you, we're smarter now"" viruses. imagine tackle next pandemic scale hundred years whatever even faster. risk, best wait next spring (and probably wait long regardless). idea expect vaccine. nailed it. point years Californians bragged world's fifth largest GDP, thinking they'd one biggest countries left US. they're reliant Federal government.

It's nice wake call anyone thinking state secede make own. Switzerland keeping open France Germany closed, going interesting see worse outcome is. hope federally mandated. one asked him. Big sports crowds fucking worst.  Sounds like need find another job instead complaining have. Take care yourself. America 100% possible. that's realism seeing we've seen people year. optimism comes recent vaccine results. I'm personally still worried vaccines provide us enough protection we'll new strains poor adherence getting vaccines. People living like nothing happening ones ensuring back stadiums. moment looks good us right thing throughout rest winter, chances go down. wealthy Assholes, them.

Of course, tone leadership top, blame them? quite possibly best news could asked ongoing depression haze. deal next summer 'lose breath' going stairs? O2 saturation goes exercise. exceptionalism.

""*I'm* careful""
""It possibly happen *me*""

Typical kind narcissistic personalities often seek public office. Yup, totally think way cancer. Yeah, he's jackass. first issue, honestly hope gets fired. 80% compliance rate essentially eliminated influenza outbreak.

Now that's finding. Wow. god worst one failure polio accidently using live virus got positive rapid-return results yesterday I'm miserable. I'm immunocompromised, constant low-grade feeling terror unshakeable. live county they've passed un-enforced mask ordinance, plenty fuckers laughing ""useless"" is. 

I can't even begin describe much hate feel people. care gets tagged ""uncivil"", want suffer this. want get sick feel way do. want watch loved ones die. 

I never forget people. never forgive them, either. 

I've never hated human beings like before. hate them. 

I fucking HATE them. governor publicly refunded fine authorized local sheriffs levy hairdresser got right wing press ignoring mandate.  Ted Cruz made big show going get hair cut there. 

There's mask mandate. going work still thing? staying work 8 hours? things need change first. NJ good amount police part problem. 

Here example Police Chief Andrew Kudrick, Jr initially refused send officers respond COVID related violations: two days later came say refusing enforce 10 people limit: mean whole UK really. love pub keeps us united We’re told exact thing US vaccine available public spring. Congrats guys! Good Fauci sticking taking pandemic seriously also avoiding getting fired so

Change leadership soon stress less lol CANNOT WAIT SEE PACKED SPORTS STADIUMS NICE LOUD AGAIN!!!!!!!!

Watching crowdless sports summer/fall really miss it, plus miss attending Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Lol nah I'm sorry. inhumane way we're handling this. Nah maybe places back spring/summer I’ve tested twice past couple weeks gotten results within 2-3 days times Can't wait feel comfortable 6 people handling nachos beer come row Wrigley next year. Ok. think understand saying. Hopefully enough people wise realize millions get vaccine December, January, open general public they'll take well. people want normal life return happens 2 ways. Vaccination, herd immunity thru infection..the ladder work, it'll kill lot people take another year so. Maybe longer. That’s like...what? 1 NY apartment building? so? much money costs relative much money spend? Period. Hope it’s cold car :(  ask conversations around looked like? family members reach you, reach them? parents cool canceling Thanksgiving, they've got real bug ear Christmas. :( Compared demographics do. hard, I'm sure exactly struggling with. trying say? young, previously healthy student ICU Covid, long hauler friend - sick since March. I’m high risk, along two family members. Members football team tested positive, asymptomatic, showed myocardial inflammation even months later. young athletes peak health. Or, were.

I’m gonna worry. I've edging entire year. come town I'm going wear voice fails me. Reminds first best world ebola vaccine based human adenovirus gonna show world scientific data showed 95%+ effectivity. 
Then, nothing happened. remember first time saw that... cholesterol spiked images alone... beautiful... Agreed find official information safety effectiveness either government biontech themselves? Yes people refuse believe worse flu. Yet evidence shows it’s much worse . stable 3 months normal fridge temps. oxford vaccine stable 6 months normal fridge temps, needs two jabs. He's talking elderly, he's young realize mean 50+ Idk getting downvoted. keep raising wages travel ICU nurses, can't expect endless supply skilled healthcare professionals fill specialized demanding jobs. 

This also happens tightly restrict immigration years, despite immigrants playing vital role functioning economy healthcare system. Third world countries reach herd immunity long vaccines arrive there, sadly. like ashamed humanity reacted develop misanthropic mindset. Cause that's been. Human nature worst. Mass selfishness greed hate. surprised see rise Fascism later decade since seem want repeat 20th century mistakes. know takes good 4-6 weeks actually immunized shot, right? everyone able get vaccinated time. nothing ""vaccine hesitant"". one ""high risk"" people getting months start distributing it. make ""vaccine hesitant""? many health safety corners cut develope vaccine short time?

What measure place adequately track side effects rapidly given mass population? Can't wait burn mask collection huge festival summer. realize important community gatherings well taken away once. can't wait go back street fairs buy overpriced adorable things get street food. walk around crowd without worrying (but know I'll able mentally turn worry awhile, still can't look videos times without uneasy). want go art festivals hear musicians. want go restaurant full sounds dishes clanking conversations. want people watch airport going trip somewhere. 

2021 make feel like again. grateful excited get vaccine. agree heteronomous populations different herd immunity levels? thanks lol education preferably  Something ""before"" - ""during"". people supporting unemployed? political global discussion without scientific base. Scientists actually saying virus dangerous media displays scientific reason mass lockdowns etc.

Yes, actual scientists say that.

But like said, would better end discussion seem locked opinion. Hope so, gonna put big dent deaths hospitalizations going spring. *Fauci waiting find Supreme Court says fraudulent election changing views virus gone *. - fixed end. Lmao ironic.😂🤦‍♂️ didn’t qualify $1200 stimulus check, made much 2018. hate idea free loaders getting paid nothing using tax dollars. No, appeal authority.

An appeal authority would said ""well regulators say effective, must be""

What I'm explaining said ""regulators data"" wrong. regulators data. sincerity crap ""reporting"" premature kerfuffle causing nonsense. Nobody said ""will NEVER require"" . certain EUA (provided approved next week 2) lifted requirements ""Approved USE"" happens COVID vaccine included [immunization allowed school set forth state local governments. current time, saying anything requiring requiring stupid. Unless vaccine fully approved, cannot mandated, school children lowest level priority vaccine common place reliable production happening. 

Right now, doses around x-mas- kids holiday break school either way, take MONTHS ramp production get front line HC workers, elderly, first responders....vaccinated first. 

I woudl think maybe covid vaccine would ne required FALL 21 admissions- earliest, Tennessee rest country follow. Time tell- well. described entire field theoretical physics. voted yet page 6 show education sector essential workers phase 1b Mad cow disease-susceptible Asian Scotland 119 Kansas, population 3 million. That's all-time high. UK's Covid response driven politics rather science. government listened scientists said government wanted hear. quite bad US, Trump nominated Scot Atlas, went direction. don’t mean rude offensive way mods sub, day subreddit closes good day, hope comes soon :) Oh, forget, Chief. *glossed over*. Reddit comments carry character limit.  things need start universal US, however Northeast state initially handled well. changed. government refused take leadership hard decisions need made. ICUs 80% full rising. can't keep schools open due much staff quarantine. need roll back prior phases waiting disaster justify it, instead proactive avoiding upcoming disaster. That's 100% doses ordered administered February.

A bold assumption. Let's see plays out.

Me, I'm filing lies administration's spun public course pandemic. long term side effects? could say IFR big guess IMO. CDC saying infections 10 times catching proof this. Using estimate saying 130 millions Americans Covid would need real proof this. Even numbers referring even states estimate. wouldn’t use estimates. assume agree disagree one thing sure happy Vaccines coming hope get Vaccine available.  depends enough actually fill stadium ""US COVID deaths remain well major pandemics Christmas Day""  Won’t rule incentivate people go washing hands? got lucky man. likely one plane it. Yeah odd kind deal blood bank strike. American. Zero stadiums Florida (or anywhere country) full right now. made garbage. Read article, Negative U.S. able distribute enough coronavirus vaccine doses immunize 100 million people end February, President Donald Trump’s coronavirus vaccine czar said. Honest question, though, agree bubble. venue would played games? would therefore needed spread week something played 3-5 different locations? America number 1!!!!!!!!!!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 imagine runs range. I've seen stories people got making tearful pleas others wear masks joke, got really sick lost family members both. I've heard stories people hospital still saying covid hoax, even they're dying it. Congratulations  enough parents pull kids force league make right decision. Hmmm....that’s fucked. feel like US becoming 2nd world country. first second dose? Good enough 1 month electricity internet. scale ...one last time Sure beats 'on Helium Indefinitely' never seen someone walks without mask alone puts get close people. assholes without masks never put on. Wear fucking goddamned mask home. fucking hard. Let's save fucking lives fuck sake. Yes done time national review. Trump saying vaccine would delayed New York politically motivated lie. Same. 

I plan still wearing masks 2021 FOMIN Amazon actually, night. forgot Goya Guy Pillow loser miss gym. also miss going beer pizza without thinking might die kill family member. help education founding Vaccines work 100% time.

The idiots vaccinating, worse gets legitimately cannot get vaccinated, vaccine effective on. toss volcano. Enough already I’m saying anything either way covid vaccine, vaccines unintended consequences. Polio, one. Hahahaha political angle Blurt laughed guy comparing Jesus crucified. Science come long way.. hopefully nightmare sooner rather later Well thats good thing really deadly viruses. kill fast usually spread slow. may brains nature understands high death virus favors propagating. get bad pandemics viruses kill hosts. That's SARS fizzled out. much deadlier Covid. Symptom onset also 24 48 hours. sick people spread much. thinning herd.. really problem? Yessssssssssss mean. put camp all. even little. \~60% population even willing get vaccinated, buuuuuuuullllshit. I’m going bawling first plane ride post-COVID. “babymoon” scheduled March 2020. time able actually take trip, child year old. Crazy think about. Oh please Herr schwarzenegger. Get yourself. Oh I’m fuck sub well. Ban baby ban 🖕 wife exact boat. always type. I'm pretty much opposite. really hope we're able go back semblance lives before. want able go things hope break extreme comfort zone I've gotten never going anywhere. physician, heard hospital system collapsing 3 weeks, certainly hope doesn't. would really suck lol. Dr. Anthony Fauci expresses optimism??!! fucking way! kick rocks. Seriously, least 50% vaccinated, remaining 50% stupid peace care. Can't teachers faculty etc. get vaccinated then?  never chat single full stadium Florida rn. 'republicans bad' trumps (no pun intended) actual facts, right? can't keep new-fangled technology. could look see might ""acceptable"" relatives.

Unless comes straight Fox News, Newsmax, OANN, Briebart, Infowars, they'll ignore it.
And loons decided Fox liberal hopeless lol. Big cities seem taking seriously. Dallas, mask use great. County Judge (who run counties TX) initially locked us earlier cities US. Governor took way local leaders rights enforce lockdowns.  Like disproving tea pot orbiting Saturn? Atleast got data NHS get vaccine, bet media report documentary progress

Edit: *we get... This. don’t know it’s hard people sub understand this. “jab me, baby” shit weird. legit reason hesitant. experimental vaccine. It’ll take cool-headed persuasion convince people. Community service 120 days COVID wing hospital. like 800k initial injections approx. 400k vulnerable people front line health workers. still along time yet normal life comes back. still great news none less! childhood illnesses, may control sees. SIL would request everyone get TDap visiting babies young vaccinated, example. Pre-covid let 2 4 year old playdates kids whose parents anti-vaxxers.

If adults around vaccinated chances getting low. Young babies herd immunity important. CDC guidelines say need quarantine tested positive less 3 months ago. also tough athletes willing throw hissy fit quit basically nothing Can’t tell you’re intentionally trolling not.

It may serious demographic, still pass dozens people pass dozens on, eventually infecting good number people serious.

The battle covid young people protecting ourselves, it’s protecting vulnerable. Tomorrow Friday you’ll know many people got sick people like this. angry fucking politicians people. China many vaccine issues rich travel Hong Kong get theirs. propaganda, single Google search tell Wow. boss truther? don’t think many governments able third lockdown come ramping vaccine production Wouldn’t appropriate analogy street filled people begging, proceed take money everyone’s pocket, give money one beggar? still go work / shopping.  tier system. Derbyshire tier 3 pubs restaurants still closed. Thank you, that's first time I've ever seen comment sub. Good job Hopefully, run invisible brick wall. example: Hatsune Miku-like global singing product literally virus. Symptoms include: Permanent hearing loss, migraine headaches, seizures, blood vomiting, etc. Hopefully, take lot things granted next time. interesting. live theyre another fast food restaurant lol i've never inside one, gotten drive thru food couple times [archive link anyone trouble accessing article [And comparison rest recall also tried keep ship non-Covid, worked poorly virus infectious. Covid patient (even admitted reasons) among non-covid patients facility ill equipped isolate patients.

These ships great trauma hospitals, need trauma hospitals, could keep free covid. Ah, Cuomo dropped ""we gotta test ourselves"" BS. Political hack. speculative algorithm tries factor reporting lag shows may 80 day currently: Speculative! guess better go commit crime get Covid vaccine law abiding citizens get theirs. /s  waste limited number doses supply interrupted. need keep everyone recommended regimen. Better make assumptions availability yet. Maybe future could rollout along supply chains demonstrated reliable. Damnit r/conservative, stop believing thing Trump says! also arguments 4% USA population tested positive frankly idiotic. 4% tested positive since March, trial started late summer.

It must troll post may be, get 70% population much better off. Thanks. makes sense. article important issue use google translate. Sorry family. love .1% wrong leave study conducted Feb1-June 2020 percentage deaths see care read 50  99.9% survive plain wrong. wish well hope loved ones able stay safe trying times.  I'll respond DM, say whether concerned I've never met husband know everything medical history. evaluated, likely come conclusion ""nothing do, continue monitor."" ain’t taking shit virus disease. 

What kinf scientist girlfriend, exactly? clarify : anti vaxx post. shows need cautious side effects. Imagine happened loved ones expert matter, understanding town (and towns) fire department COVID-19 patients get house ER. point is, God praying going save virus. Quarantine, PPE, vaccines - say SCIENCE - give us fighting chance. God thank vaccine. Science is. Amazing news! case, yes course; UK managed bypass inane bureaucracy. I’d argue economist doesn’t seriously consider insight field behavioral economics provides hack. People don’t act like perfect “rational” beings expected economic modeling. rules? entire state lockdown. governor came said possible week however. Oh UK wants kill British people? really think there'll even 100 million doses country February 28th, let alone 200 million doses required vaccinate 100 million people?

Oh sure think that! Well, opinion calling exponentially. is. people understand danger doubling numbers every X amount time. R=1.025 dangerous, go ask street many people would think good extended period time. Explaining doubling time 28 days still dangerous bit easier explain understand. Maybe someone really needs alibi ? Re-infections exist, rare. [Qatar found risk re-infections 0.01%, mostly mild asymptomatic. ""Only one person hospitalized time reinfection, still mild infection. deaths recorded."" Serious re-infections also recorded, even rarer.

Antibody levels sometimes decline, natural, memory cells take body re-exposed virus, manufacture antibodies demand. low undetectable level antibodies mean lack immunity. However, people recovered asked continue follow precautions, re-infection big problem, prevent people seeing perks try get infected deliberately. take couple years start shaking hands stuff like meetings, etc majority land California burned **federal** land.
The weather conditions California vastly different compared Tennesse. Forest fires natural part ecosystem. California also double amount forest area TN.

Poverty Rate:

California	12.8% (Ranked 26th best)

Tennesse 15.3% (Ranked 41st best)

Do know silly disingenuous compare raw numbers populous state CA (39,512,223) United States vs 16th populous ranked 10th States dependency federal money.

California ranked 36th States dependency federal money.

Tennessee	ranks 22nd State's residents dependency federal money.

California ranks 44th State's residents dependency federal money. I’ve read lot arguments favor vaccinating prisoners thread actually make lot sense. There’s going lot lobbying vaccine priority next months hopefully everyone stay patient.

The way see it, guys committed crimes don’t deserve given high priority getting vaccinated. people stop caring taking seriously increases, people 45 supporters get caught FOMO too. see others acting like nothings wrong spreads. I've pressured attend gatherings last month throughout entire pandemic, I'm starting feel like I'm crazy one cautious thinking indoor gatherings vaccines available dangerous. friends page currently Covid, lost parent it.

Our ability empathize culture apparently time stamp personally affected thing effect people. took daughter museum Arch STL couple weeks ago field trip. pretty much empty wore masks sanitized every 15 minutes. felt pretty safe there. researched protocols, called times they'd lowest number people, planned safely could. worth really enjoyed it.   it. realistic. I'm much happier German approach keeps realistic mindset rather believing everything next week life go back normal people vaccine. worry, stadium Iron Bowl full last week!  foreign concept politicians justify fellow lobbyists way, shape, form. 30% end Feb means 200M doses administered. Didnt say could 20-30M month? said mean 20-30M people month??

And case US hog global supply realize it’s economy never full tilt it’s trading partners can’t get vaccine doses  thing would make many Americans start care dark skinned people Middle East killing Americans. wonder people refuse heed warning virus smh Would love donate, might mad cow disease. :-D Along people lived Europe 90s. Europe single homogeneous country, know. /s. staffing. Austin, Texas checking in. Adler embarrassment city 6 years takes cake. streets overflow homeless crime, defunds police tells us stay home Cabo. fuckin joke. Haha close! yet... :p Gabe opening though thank Thalidomide bad example, drug still used things, orginally marketed sedative anxiety treatment. never trial pregnant women german company started selling treatment morning sickness. recently come early pregnant voluteers report report issues early company covered YEARS. 2 years launching morning sickness treatment withdrawn sold counter, cover ups kept sold number years that. actually use sickness arouns 3-4 years.

This era post war regulatory bodies testing regimes simply exist certainly extent now. Even FDA protected USA refusing approve 6 times insiting tests done (a small number effected babies born US tests).

Pharm companies lying, covering stuff make cash matter nothing new lol.

A vaccine drug tho made quite clear offered children pregnant woman. Europe also hit hard, heard Japan also seeing pretty big increase. Yeah, I’ve played bands life. It’s big piece that’s missing. know are, state many others shut everything down. Turned pointless anyways guess LMAO, getting poor realize control...we're busy begging go back work goddamn pandemic rather demanding fair compensation bosses, good luck that. say “I do” January/February probably gonna worst point entire pandemic. Psych hunker down. Fucking asshole. It’s almost human race decided they’ve enuf time planet would like go extinct monkeys day again. Oh gosh many shows couldn’t go to! Thankful livestreams ain’t obviously. hope get time soon :) flew home grandpas funeral back early June. Air travel still thin (I think it’s picked now) Ohare one like 25 people American terminal usually feels like 15k people lol. Sorry, pretending 30% decline acceptable lockdown? you’re going it, half assed? think problem conflating things. able identify ""end"" pandemic? Hey, know phone coltan it?

Getting sitter 2 toddlers wife see favorite band concert. books April got ruined. gotten much time us since tbh. 250,000 less 1000 deaths per day, close COVID 9/11 Jesus fucking christ First list along long term care residents.  Yeah, didnt sound like they'd taking 1 100 mil doses  so? Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. point even matter, 700,000,000 dollars people starving streets. thousand bucks account 5 million children starving, god awful human being. 700,000,000 way much money reason. arguing fine company worth $700,000,000 even $150,000,000,000? bro 4 fucking cents. people creating income gap profiting it. fucking monsters. mate. pick whole field one, since theoretical work *by fucking definition* data less instead model based, aka inductive. 

This fun, I’m May 2021 here, postponed May 2020. hoping vaccine miracle tickets see Hamilton. Theatres shut 2 weeks tickets scheduled. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 stroke, simply enjoy stacking assumption upon assumption? mostly United States pandemic point. live big ten college town. football basketball terrible local economy (not mention mostly online school) also personal well being. usually tailgate every home game attend basketball games. It’s bummer without Year 2021 COVID-19, means year 4041 AD Reviewing data. meet 10 December wouldn’t hold breath anything then. UK got access rolling data review final decision didn’t take long. Due vaccine becoming highly politicized US FDA decided rolling reviews instead reviewing data EUA requested. Free flights. employment? Yes, FDA passes NY likely well. experts viewing data. change fact still independent review hopes relieve anxiety general public  think you’ll see lot people, included, mentally unprepared something like long time. I’ll wearing masks awhile public likely won’t attending concert movie theater ... while. I’m excited normality return, time I’m ready wonder practical matter? overworked overtired people make mistakes us likely cause setbacks letting folks still rest recharge. They’re trying make low enough people actually comply. Even 12 days would better, people willing comply 10 days it’s worth “Never Forget 9/11”
Most haven’t nearest mass casualty experienced.

History falls deaf ears We're deep right people still wear fucking mask. Keep dreaming Interesting. Thank you. I'm willing try anything. I'll check out. get nauseous VR though. we'll see. RemindMe! 3 months maybe 24/7 footage hospitals. Weeeeeeed! Sounds like it'd hell story. I'm glad okay seem post-covid symptoms lot survivors have. said, possible, expressing support gratitude frontline healthcare staff would help much. also get days though. run degree lower look change. Well obviously vacation Mexico, that'd mean would give something even though he's position power. ive already 2 coworkers say wont get vaccinated. thinking wont need it... bet fuckin shortage paid cash money, even 1/2 1/3 blood bank gets sell it. swimming stuff.

You're donating blood, selling awful price. No, really. German politicians get people's hopes up, disappointed later. think people super vigilant, health general society beginning. countries everybody well truly paid off. countries get benefit far less point super vigilant, get sick pass people matter everyone else it, may well enjoy life. kind game theory scenario, everyone good super vigilance would work, soon people started taking seriously vigilant turned lose lose situation. Imagine robust GDP

but 9% unemployed

and 7.1 million living poverty

and largest homeless population country.

Is progress? Eugenics?  bad covid oil fields, we'd bring freedom asses 19 half years. Jesus fucking Christ, I’m talking Biontech actually made vaccine. posted repeatedly. one getting pass. That's USA. There's many countries around world well. global travel thing think we'll see normal 2022. It'll take time. hope I'm wrong. forget still 100% effective we'll still take precautions protect sick, vulnerable, elderly etc. see source people saying would trillions suicides? Like slowest predictable, preventable, car wreck ever. Damn right. live refuse bash country unnecessarily! Lol real thing UK? kinda sociopath goes /r/nhl instead /r/hockey Today going historically bad day US. honestly see issue people hesitant. fact, probably smart way approach it. People every right little nervous something took 1/10 time normal vaccine life cycle. Saying people tinfoil hat wearers actually pretty offensive way harm good. get point.
Each country chance. Australia, India, USA, Newzealand chance. country behaved differently.
I still remember day zero cases state. Institutional quarantine mandated. one fine day government says fuck it. quarantine. trust behave sensibility. Witin mere days, started hearing super spreaders returning abroad, attending parties. one month hit 500 cases per day avoid side-effects vaccine ... (wait it) ... taking it.

If skeptical vaccine, perfectly defensible avoid **while continuing self-quarantine home**. that's really we're talking about, it? Anti-vaxxers generally want reap rewards *other* people taking vaccine, get closer herd immunity, anti-vaxxers typically want accept restrictions themselves. That's people get angry. People strong immune systems clear virus faster weak immune systems proven

You confused. deaths ""strong"" immune system. Literally, immune systems attacking organs. vaccine increases immune response. proven

It's proven reduces asymptomatic spread. know little vaccines asymptomatic cases (the mRNA ones) monitor all. again, people still spread asyptomatically, possible everyone vaccinated could INCREASE spread virus people go back office, bars, etc otherwise would have. Looking numbers already tallied looking possible today exceeds 3,000 deaths. Third world countries actually better equipped mass vaccination first world countries done mass vaccinations recently. Yes, ultra cold freezers problem vaccines require third world getting ones. want go back concerts festivals actually experience University. transfer student first year online. get year person I'm lucky.  Again, comparing apples oranges. can't begin try explain different year year. hope see effects travel, work conditions, health, etc year make assumption lots changes happening skew numbers. Even simple things like less people road going affect many people die car accident per day, right? total number many would died otherwise, I'm saying extraordinary year like numbers flawed. curious, nurse hospital, healthcare workers list? haven’t heard False. prayed God, yes, also invented practices like quarantine PPE (i.e. plague doctor masks). People history lacked knowledge, intelligent us. I’m actually looking forward paying $16 beer inside stadium. know taken vaccine? People get diagnosed COVID go daily lives normal show symptoms definitely give shit anyone else. asked anti-vax took vaccine let Kid Rock concert well they're gonna tell did. people going ignore happening?! Southern California already discussing rationing hospital beds.

It seems USA reaching 9/11 death levels combined movie Groundhog Day. terrible many people country care enough fellow Americans try prevent happening. still states decide vaccine distributed. Ine would hope observe cdc guidelines, even folllowing recommendations still tough decisions need made - especially states receive enough initial doses vaccine cover elderly long term care facilities first responders... God want us wear masks, create them?

If God want us listen doctors scientists, create them?

Pray that! really depend life insurance able provide families event tragic situation taking place. pass on, would feel safe knowing wife would least able stay afloat time worry pay mortgage bills time get feet move forward.

So want insurance companies do? want sell policies expected loss? British Medical Journal. 
We've seen press releases. None even peer reviewed. 


""Second, trial subjects living new normal (social distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene etc), means chances contracting virus already low. would mean know subjects vaccine group protected due vaccine contact yet. definitive approach could involve deliberately challenging trial subjects virus, like preclinical trials, however, unlikely due ethical safety implications. absence definitive challenge test, becomes imperative rush conclude efficacy within weeks vaccination. keep getting downvoted right. aholes want recognize initial heartless assumptions wrong prisons risk needs addressed vaccines. spread Covid-19 continues accelerate across United States, residents Oklahoma asked take part prayer day state’s Republican governor, Kevin Stitt. announcement, Mr Stitt said Oklahomans pray God amid pandemic, seen 200,000 people state contract coronavirus, almost 2,000 lose day prayer planned Thursday, churches places worship due host take has, meanwhile, statewide mandate masks, despite new Covid-19 cases increasing 18 per cent past two weeks, according Associated Press, demands Democrats medial Monday alone, state recorded another 2,200 coronavirus cases seven deaths, Mr Stitt announced prayer day. Oh, didn’t see that. Nice! Summer is... optimistic hollow mindless consumerism world over. Nature take course, lower heads accept choice. 

Society already heavily changing. clinging onto past, let go.  Honestly freaking tired comments. tons information Internet regarding safety vaccines question asked ad nauseum. think so? think it’s portioned already contracts they’ve signed. single greatest danger facing humanity climate change. contributing factor overpopulation, I'm favor non-violent ways reduce numbers species. Going 4000 mile drive across country sure feels essential me. sorry hear that! Ya, know theory healcare workers getting sicker/dying exposed much virus than, say, someone caught brief encounter co-worker. Seems like increased chance long-term (medium term?) health issues would go  One co-workers tested positive COVID two weeks ago. Still lots symptoms visibly sick. wife sick it. 

They told him, even though still tested negative still symptomatic, youre contagious two weeks come back work. want beat head wall. least he's wearing mask JFC hate American work culture. Yeah could infect people. report local nursing board. sounds like great reason get license revoked. Florida crazy, Florida schizophrenic. subtle difference. original polio vaccine also effect? That's common risk live vaccines. Agree endless shitting US getting old Europe recovering pretty well 7 hours comments? Incredible. Americans musta backed horror. happy Italians social democracy. got much cash rest EU costs Italian government nothing.

It Dutch Germans paying it.

I wonder Italy Spain ever help us north hit 32.000 dead, around number emotionally blackmailed rest EU moldy 'ole dough. people infected COVID die first year immortal gain ability fly?

 

It's never 'perfect information nothing.' Taking vaccine wildly lower risk infected. taking vaccine lack complete outcome certainty like driving without seat belt might get stuck accident. isnt first issue Oxford/AstrAzeneca Vaccine ran issues. death reported involving one participants. claim individual never given CovidShield vaccine another individual UK developed severe side effects also claimed wasnt cause vaccine. either case, zero scientific proof given Oxford/AstrAzeneca regard either participant developed symptoms.  I'm sure already do. still able state treated less human others. insulting unscientific. *cries California* opposite me, soap bleach hands sanitizer gives baby ha fs won't. lead people, advise people, educate people want selfish dumb wont ever listen. hear stories listened blah blah. Get new friends see r/sino astroturfing thread. Sheesh. read thr UK 10 million doses end December enough vaccinate 5 million. terms majority vaccinated leaked document recently believe said March. I'd probably say around March earliest going get Christmas alone monumental depression result COVID. favorite time year, I'm risking infection 2 connecting flights (from south, culture warped around COVID) back home north. know do. I've never spent alone. I've spent entire year completely alone. supposed live months, turned year. feel trapped. we’ve like 6 weeks.

3rd 4th week March. First week June. Last week October first two weeks November. border staying closed truckers pilots bringing Moderna vaccine too? Ah guess not. “America bad, stuff need.” Always money there. go. 50,000 people did, let damn stadia. never claimed be. We're democratic republic. Teachers get priority covid testing near me. cut line flashing DOE badge. assume that's work. Thats lockdown means, however, yes LA county allowed certain things since end June, state California lockdown entire time. Think like, May normalcy. I’d say April yet see expert support lol yeah May better warp speed head thinks get right IFR.

No wasn't. figure based data California NYC already higher total fatality rate. obviously wrong start. realized really care. convinced okay govt restrict movement actions MIGHT and/or spread covid. me, one things human can't legislated. Humans get sick, humans die. feel comfortable holding someone else accountable got sick. many variables. chose fat fuck, get diabetes, heart disease, even drew short straw born it, healthy guy penalized? want stay in, stay in. want go out, go out. feel sorry medical front line people. Europe going too. Don’t bash US cool. Yeah, underwriting life insurance strict since eventually everyone dies. everyone needs health care (okay, everyone needs kind care, everyone gets cancer, heart disease, etc may expensive provide), presumably life insurance policies pay insurer wants make sure payout waaaaaaay future.  Wales anything like England, means he's banned pubs one neighbourhood. cdc quarantine reduction based legit science get Americans back work? China 

The one better kill someone accident try save them? What’s end goal? comments make question :) must healthy time released, suppose? Nah, measles like .2%, lowest covid estimates get that, would say literally everyone reminder FDA fauci agrees vaccine say safe ill weary. im sure safe Really, ""not damn thing""? guy/gal wrong though. Indian doctors extremely talented. Many study abroad, come back perform complex surgeries. year government takes one extra step make sure doctors less valued. Yes I'm talking government's law allowing Ayush doctors perform surgeries bridge courses etc probably refuse entry vaccine deniers

While I'd this, logistics US make virtually impossible it'll happen. best hope would sort 'honor system' could sue someone caused outbreak. Expecting sort universal vaccination certificate produced that's secure people carry everywhere extraordinarily unlikely. Yeah, no. PE teacher middle school, would insult bully students reason, including raising voice us. witnessed eyes teacher choke one classmates. guy Canadian. didn’t last long school, since never bought “All Canadians nice” schtick. 

Now sane people going say, “he doesn’t represent Canadians.” Well, neither “Americans” original post. it’s dangerous think absolutes generalizations.

That teacher ex military, worked daily middle schoolers a, please allow say, somewhat prestigious upscale school.

If ever person needed embody “Canadians pride polite, accommodating, inclusive looking other” stuff, him. Instead, put friend choke hold strangled unconsciousness middle soccer field reason show off. Lmao get started China Africa. Curious we'll see push allow ""the market"" allocate it... True. Stop. Talking. don’t know Fauci. definitely considered whatever wildcard you’re going throw out. Just. Stop. Talking. Please.  Businesses definitely get rid mask mandate stores asap, know places still dont require masks. ""you're right don't, fired."" Also stimulus millions working shouldn’t be. Go Giants! ya'll delusional I'm sure anti-vaxxer conspiracy theorists going change mind people accuse corrupt liars criminals said vaccine safe. I’m genuinely asking, know symptom hypochondria? Kids EXTREMLY low risk, quite bit lower flu common illnesses. That's I've said need economic measures strong scientific ones. full stadia allowed mandatory sellouts. tickets bought, people surrounding area made go games. know God hand science? Thanking God vaccine unreasonable seem think. also sensitive fact asymptomatic people indeed driving lot spread.

However, also think there's important discussion needs regarding PCR testing cycle thresholds. lot PCR tests returned positive amounts virus RNA would able successfully cultured infect person. ending positive tests actually infected/infectious. 

This worthwhile watch topic. I'm trying minimize this, need make sure full set facts acting appropriate way. prefer die :-) American I've always viewed Australia somewhat ruggedly individualistic, probably many Mad Max movies. I'm glad see got shit together better us. Fair points. Thank comments! agree think risks fairly low I’d take vaccine, also think concerns long term safety need considered. Thanks comments sources. Hey correct. Unless average 5,500 deaths day (our current 7 day average still 2,000). Cause right confusing clue talking about. think irrational. Look infection rates whatever city brother coming from. like kid class always fucking around distracting everyone else teacher exhausted literally every option. finally kid actually gets real trouble real consequences day move sigh relief. weird all. Damn useful link. Sinovac's Phase III trial finished yet. thought current conditional approval Chinese military use, people countries get trials finished? They're actually saying (in US) general public access starting April. everyone wants vaccine vaccinated July. covid vaccines sterilizing. People get mild cases still possibly pass on.

We see social distancing restrictions gone hope mask wearing continues.

In Japan common Japan super low flu sickness death rate. traveling, can!

As far finances concerned fresh college graduate 100% financially interdependent family, claimed dependent taxes last year. lost money could seriously aided getting feet literally worst time ever graduate college.

I'm well now, holy shit stress life transition school without money. right anything immediate needs, maintain health retirement plans, rather important longer term everyone's estimate everyone US vaccinated things go back ""normal""? thinking September 2021 I'm thinking maybe January 2022 feel like it'll take long time get everyone vaccinated. happens May-June completely possible, even people sub don’t want admit it. Ohio become East Berlin something? theory airborne, wear masks breathe each-other without care. Scott Atlas? Scott Flat Earth, like it. **M**ode**RNA** Thank you. would blame age/life experiences lately I'm sure. Hehe wife’s co-worker hit 90% weekend. lot trouble breathing chest pain. went ER hit 80%, tested negative COVID twice (rapid test only. said pneumonia gave antibiotics sent home. Apparently don’t administer PCR test hospital Illinois outside St. Louis, mind boggling. Hey man that’s quite wildly politically biased statistic.

NYC already experienced great surge Cuomo placed Covid patients nursing homes killed elderly (meanwhile taking family nursing homes).

Their old population already got hit rest immune die it.

How biased compare worst timeline versus stable timeline two different places? would nice. 

But reality, people selfish assholes. 

And lie lot. article says 10 million 10 day period added 10 day period November 7-November 17, total approximately 8.7 million. So. . . Thanksgiving 2020 1.3 million travelers 10 day period. think number really need worry people traveled short distances gathered families large groups. much safer quickly pass people airport wearing mask keeping distance gather eat drink indoors 6-50 family members course entire day. Cool, guess New England spike unless guys choose stub toe get shot car robbery way hospital must toe injury killed right?

Underlying conditions one factor death, unless arguing everyone dies covid diabetes would died tomorrow diabetes without covid, disingenuous. That's phrase article posted ""contributing"" conditions. covid contributing factor, factor, death reported covid death, should.

On completely baseless (and 9 month old) assertion covid much worse [So far 2020, 9.9 million people had COVID-19 in U.S. 230,000 people died of COVID-19 in U.S. 2020.
By comparison, 2019-2020 flu season U.S., 38 million people flu 22,000 people died cite anything try back claim?

""Some doctors"" believe eating less gluten cure cancer. large scale reports? data support claim widespread? people doctors putting covid tested? common symptoms? die similar ways covid patients?

Just heard something Trump Fox News 9 months ago mean true. Also, curiosity, even covid subreddit believe dangerous? came persuade us liberals, think claims Trump link site even journal? good place start. guy conclusion ran it...even glaringly obvious evidence contrary. He's trying set US ""authoritarian, divided, racist"" society failed traits.

The funniest part saying emulate countries. New Zealand Australia somewhat reasonable though bit unfair since neither country shares land border another. Canada well right...but again, one neighbor helps comparison certainly reasonable. comes funny part...the European Union.

The UK recently 1.5 times deaths/capita, France around twice deaths per/capita Italy nearly three times many deaths/capita.

There successful democracies (New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan). democracies failed (the US, UK, Italy, France, etc.). Likewise authoritarian governments eventually got virus control (PRC Vietnam) ones (Russia).

Trying make sort moral battle good vs evil quite frankly stupid.  Fed market support.means jack shit workers suffering.  I've made handful in-person last-minute trips to(meds, school supplies kid teachers M-F cannot form syllabus save lives. kid's Saturday school gave us annual syllabus, know possible) rest delivered doorstep contact. relatives protected better major Corp like Target pertinent let Mitch McConnell slip nasty stimulus caveat employers hook employees getting infected job. LA county ""the largest non–state-level government entity United States."" home 10 million people. state, would 9th populous. 

The City Council LA, home 4 million people, 14 seats. Chicago, 60 percent LA's population, 50 seats city council.

The LA county board supervisors 5 seats. 5. 1 per 2 million people. powerful people.

~*the know*~ He's anti mask. negative opinions people wear masks think trying get people wear infringement freedom. simply feels comfortable wearing one thinks touching surfaces dangerous. bizarre cognitive dissonance. People skipping wall fingers ears saying “la la la.” Well I'm still screwed

NASA Rules thee He’s doctor underserved area decides fly somewhere. History really repeat itself... Obesity factor even curve go parabolic reach BMI 35. Lots fatties that. seems County Constables perfect entities enforce mask mandate, much way NYC Sheriff's Office taken lead enforcing Covid related rules there. Constables, like NYC Sheriff, primarily tasked enforcing civil laws regulations, well criminal laws. don’t love it, sometimes it’s easier laugh cry. thought happy hypoxics risk patients already circulation compromised disease disease goes exponential fast. There's still flu, common cold, litany diseases kill people. cool okay killing people get drink. We've learned lot year annual lockdowns winter full masking year way prevent mass death. One good thing come this.  Hope whole family dies ventilator piece shit. Nobody knows--Vaccine rollout going take long time, especially people 40 so, they're last list *This* makes virus scary. many mild courses illness evolved seemingly chronic conditions.

#You suck!

It's fault!

It's fault! Cute think care taunts. isn’t surprising. I’m active kink community, local dungeons holding limited attendance mask place; still, many people choosing play home best choice. swingers events going California since May. I’m frankly surprised first time hearing super-spreader event. Even swingers wearing mask, still swapping fluids. 

Then again, alternative lifestyle, you’re also announcing contact tracers others potentially got COVID risky event. don’t want friends/partners. like watching train crash slow motion, it? horrible. Stay safe!  RemindMe! One Year Take vaccine sheep mean, UK approved first vaccine use today plan roll next week so, so... kinda? end Jan may seeing starting effect.  I've got flights Japan (from UK) next Easter. lucky could reschedule summer.

Its going really tight looking possible! Maybe!

Fingers everything else crossed. embarrassment   bills piling need feed family. federal government needed step pay guys stay home support families

Where money come one paying taxes? couple months ago sizeable check going unemployed every week ($600) came time renew politicians decided important pissing match help people. assuming soap works fine governor made point (and done since) announcing mask mandate enforcement penalties. Counties fine businesses requiring masks staff enforce either. remember assholes trying film NYC hospitals claiming empty height spring wave. fabricate reality. \#Winning? Ahh thats hot... Thats hot False positives. Cases mean sh*t  fucking say?! word. never would've guessed! Given complete lack 250,000 casualties, anti-mask propaganda, government leaders refuse scientific and/or critical thought, would've guessed rest world actually hotspot! Yeah hospital load already 60% higher last two peaks, 26th bringing /u/HermanCainsGhost ? Screw buddy, geinuses make us bomb you! Cuz got bombs! Pepsi! can't Pepsi BOMBS but... US bad... cases vary case counting. biggest problem using deaths high variance based demographics population involved - older? healthy? Obese? etc. outbreak 500 cases - school vs. nursing home, decidedly different result deaths. dont mind asking, what's like ventilated? intubated oxygen mask? sedated, painful? governor repeatedly undercut local efforts get virus control. Abbot Patrick scum and, maintain, tried Hague shit pulled. Indefensible monsters them. That’s thought. I’m going get vaccine eventually. I’m going continue distance. people spreading refuse distance, don’t wear masks, don’t plan getting vaccinated. leave house month donned mask gloves. circle two people trust same. chances getting spreading slim.  Definitely needs mask now, oxygen mask. read something made pause another thread yesterday. People ICU Christmas already infected. might start showing symptoms coming week, need go hospital middle month. Actions speak louder words... want spend $12 beer! Paywall, think something GOP. clarified elsewhere thread.

The post seven upvotes made comment expect going hit front page would worded better. “The 14-day quarantine recommendation CDC remains effect, revised guidance given public health agencies offers two ways people shorten period. community adequate testing resources, quarantine end seven days person tests negative virus point final two days period. test either rapid-response antigen test, reliable PCR test takes longer process.” Still blaming Trump becoming really tiresome, give rest--Everybody responsible actions-- people dumb enough believe politicians say anything, that's fault--Look mess Britain, Brits screaming Boris weeks upvote once???? 
Pfizer Man 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 richest country earth failed one purpose - keeping citizens safe.

When US ever kept citizens safe? already ready video hospitals Italy. people wearing oxygen helmets lined corridors oxygen alarms patients desat. convince you, nothing will. edgy Imagine conflicting messages school districts “mandatory masks school building school hours” (with poorly attempted social distancing) masks distancing school sports, clubs, activities also impacting subconscious entire generations American children education system mention. It’s upsetting disappointing, say least. looks like one high schools would use filming say California. also drive thrus. Yea man, I’m sure US government hasn’t looked single COVID map year 🙄 Ahhh classic catch Virus Events seems immune Workplace good Taxpayers keep Economy running I’ve wondering Sars Cov 2 Government made kind deal ? Cutting close terms of.....?? Please, complete sentences thoughts. Astounding comment got many upvotes. Honestly, right. medical achievement possible probably rest century would cure HIV/AIDS cancer. next spring

wait wut, thought said everyone US March / April? sub historically wrong almost everything. know whose historically right? 

Dr. Fauci. Let’s leave things experts determine. No, I've never heard statement like ""Even slight drop O2 sats risk"" I've reading lot Covid since January. Try incognito tab browser problem sturgis people went group sex got Covid bonus thought liked test children? Makes angrier Canada rely countries give us vaccine don’t production capability. need time review data provided Yikes. want choice. want research take it. not, taking 60% effective vaccine 90% [Here glory holes n95 masks men That’s kids Africa ""I’m low concern area."" kind thinking leading cause problem. ""Why care? wear mask?"" Well.... extremely contagious long incubation bbn period.... kills 2-3% people contract it. Nahh conveniently leave new ""pneumonia' ravaging Province Wuhan early August 2019.

This seems propaganda piece response document leak Chinese Government hiding actual dangers Virus. I’ll interested see impact line school closures already waning education system within United States specifically. kid hybrid schooling attends 2-3 days per week. days home, simply isn’t enough work assigned keep busy anyone available educate I’m working full time home. 80 day? would US equivalent 2616, hope 80 day happen hole would pass through? Jebus mandate save them. everyone wore masks! eyes. dongs. someone explain watched recent interview Moderna's co-founder almost star-struck. Guy immigrated Canada child, much, changing world. Incredible stuff. Fauci optimistic future? really makes feel hopeful. He's realistic, needed, ever optimistic. like realizing actually light end really freaking long tunnel!  Define “good”. delicious? Absolutely.  first thing realize insurance helpful people.

Insurance extremely helpful. Many insurance companies rural roots started cooperatives farming areas none farmers could afford replacement cost thresher caught fire field barn burnt ground animals inside. literally started communal mechanism extend burden significant statistically unlikely event across large pool participants willing pay nominal fee. theoretical perspective, options efficient offloading risk unwilling owner willing buyer. 

How insurance companies evolved methods use now, however, another story. mean concept insurance fundamentally flawed. Yes, unregulated free market, like one covid first released, utopian paradise. Isnt saying, person showing symptom got higher mortality someone doesnt show any? Emphezima mild infection, definition.

Reading posts like makes sound like everyone gets hang themselves. think essential workers line nursing home employees residents. people said wouldn’t get vaccine year?? I’m college student working one busiest hotels state. It’s job tell people mask up, get little support colleagues (they often let talk without asking), get told people time it. People laughing friends say medical exemption. People saying don’t work. Get cursed at, kinds asinine bullshit. mechanisms enforcement I’ve seen many police officers fail say anything people inside. Perhaps marches calling hoax? Sadly people prefer lifestyle, see validation previously neurotic behaviors. Yes, ""something"" SARS-CoV-2. point, unclear whether Pfizer/Moderna vaccines actually prevent infection simply act minimize severity associated symptoms giving body head start antibody production. former, anybody gets vaccine proceed life less normal transmission risk. latter, could still potentially transmit virus non-vaccinated people significant damage. important question one trials cannot used answer design. FYI, life insurance companies lot leeway denying coverage. denied policy cancer 39, even though type mild/early enough 99% survival rate. 2016, curious. also happens air farce. nah would US europeans, need get date  factors? constantly see Americans say:”we safe!!!!” mean went restaurants, big family parties, went Disney world whatever wearing pretty little cloth mask. mask ONE factor. 
And others soo important. photos seen crowded bars lack clear laws prohibiting larger gatherings would assume overall worse us. idk. word is, u pick, useless, cynical, dishonest, felonious, reckless. What’s taking US long approve? tells something already knew addressing questions. Thanks anyway. know much literal experts field? Sorry, read goonies house. Yep, reason concerns mind statement.  like drug designed treat Covid-19 happens prevent corona virus spreading physically stopping it. Bail also supposed consider probability conviction sounds like fools dead rights. even offered bail considering clearly safe community. right. changed rules again, Kauai still wonder many got sick. would one option really - 

...nuke orbit. black person China

at least well protected laws China.

try black person America Everyone downvoting needs look every state ended drinking age 21. Well generally know young healthy people likely mild symptoms probably even need go hospital covid. elderly hand far likely end hospital placing greater pressure healthcare services. main aim reduce pressure healthcare services first prevent getting overwhelmed. Sure it'll still spreading quite alot elderly vaccinated mean majority atleast protected people bashing EU regulator deliberate 2-4 weeks UK, base what? Pride brexit first?

You've missed salient point here, EU that's bashing suggesting UK rushing approval implying regulations somehow stringent MHRA's pointing what's special process. There's reason moved quickly given they've access exact data exact time, Pfizer said well. simply politics time intense negotiations ongoing Brexit EU generally looking weaker ever what's going Hungary Poland. 

It's though UK slated EU slow; EU unilaterally come harshly worded statement UK process apparent reason. Little Miss Shut Covid Testing Site shut covid testing site. Thanks! I’ll check Listen, said wrong. totally voluntary service. one 'owed' anything. Agreed. However, lot people US really depend life insurance able provide families event tragic situation taking place. pass on, would feel safe knowing wife would least able stay afloat time worry pay mortgage bills time get feet move forward.

There certainly ways trying build kind safety net, going boil people calculating risk. point lot people infected COVID nothing intentionally bring themselves. people deserve opportunity feel safe family's livelihood stripped literal pandemic. Nah I'm already paying necessities. Fuck getting first. grandparents parents need first. Doctor sewed silver mesh abdominal wall, I’m Allergic silver. Still don’t avoid hospital emergency. People dying heart attacks things could helped people like spreading crap. sees whats going care. Yeah, reactive rather preemptive really cost lot lives unnecessarily.

But seems common theme Western Europe. also Eastern Europe (compared spring) Yeah real. inspire behaviour change. know sit craving tasty meats. Thank info. believe probably attempting skate ""essential"" clause, even though everybody knows kind bullshit. We're working overtime hours ship Christmas bullshit stores feels kind non-essential me, hey, know? 

I'll check info sent make sure I'm misunderstanding work gossip, understanding read announcement. least 1 married couple live together, one tested positive symptoms work tested negative report work every day show symptoms, regardless contact home positive case daily. felt pretty ridiculous insisted CDC said, ""essential."" 

We're workforce probably 1,000 people building, across various shifts, management currently dropping like flies covid. I'm going read linked verify make appropriate calls. Thank you.  need pork scratchings every drink, single one 5 invisible mates? Girl I’ve sick decade. don’t need read stuff I’m living it. sad, advice killing people heart attacks serious issues. Cdiff sucks dying scared go hospital worse Chinese one tested 100k Chinese people far.  might silly question. get vaccine test positive antibodies regardless you’ve covid? comments? would love schools open, realistically wont fully back normal Fall 2021. don’t hospitalized order complications. don’t even really sick covid order get these. friend 40’s, healthy, mild case covid heart damage.  seen NYT cool site lists current policies state

Looks like Texas businesses open, stay home order, mandatory masks Two people actively covid isolating together shouldn’t make one another worse. too. figure, I've put way worse things body! r/GoldenKnights 

r/ShrineOfCodyGlass No, won’t time distribute vaccine enough parties back normal May headed right direction Actually said vaccine would available election. misinformation. EU country make emergency use authorisation without central approval county hits 15% covid hospitalizations, 7 days row, roll back restrictions. Bars close, Restaurants 50% capacity. practice, Restaurants already run 50% 75%, bars close try skirt rules vendoring crappy food.

 Pre third wave, masks 75% capacity rule indoor dining. probably wearing lab eye protection public, people family work directly around patients stuff months.

I made optional employees (we businesses closed night), since entire bins wrap-around safety glasses, gloves, etc supply shed free use (supplies covered contract costs businesses). would absolute greatest achievement human history could go worldwide pandemic completely normal year half time. [I'll 3 carvery dinners 3 beers Lol spot on. It’s like plague plague still ongoing. It’s mental illness, mean it’s beyond reality. got rid Easter win Didn’t already know this? stay open should
Commit closed fall 2021z Ding ding. part?

That takes time immune system replicate cells?

That larger exposure virus dangerous?

That vaccines prime immune system, producing sort differentiation would actual viral attack? Hope thing safe, zero chance US won’t approve now. *you* can’t predict long term side effects doesn’t mean scientists billions dollars funding can’t either. Calm down. anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers frankly anti-science people could problem.

The workable solution see companies tell employees must get vaccine (and provide documentation) want work there. really cry? might damn  that's simply reality I'm living got Cali, time celebratory weed!!! Hopefully COVID cases gone nationally. haven’t seen lot reporting, assume it’s backlog, maybe trend good? I’m great reading stats.  Jail... real simple. Jail time always broke underpaid already stress type coping mechanism.

Many broke underpaid jobs deemed essential. make much kept jobs. living arrangements Friday epidemic.

I know people various income brackets, educational backgrounds, etc.

Introverts handling better mentally.

Those middle class faced job loss experiencing something used to. lack funds facing much debt took based thought stable middle class income. poor multiple car notes mortgages. poor forced frugal long 2020.

In nutshell suffered financially longer periods already know survive. Okay, you, don’t force upon people long over! love see it! 3rd world countries hit hard reason...Like Africa good going vaccinate people already people haven't? Let’s look good looks like (deaths per million):

Taiwan: 0.3

Vietnam: 0.4

Thailand: 0.9

China: 3

South Korea: 10

Here’s bad looks like:

U.S.: 835 (four times worse country cited, Germany)

Right now, U.S. leads world following dubious categories:

*Serious cases, active cases, total deaths, total cases*.

This abject failure resulting reckless political leadership uninformed, selfish citizenry. excited see crazy nuts react Wow, I’ve never seen note like story:


*Editor’s note: article originally published November 30, 2020 number errors misleading claims. First, labeled “Opinion,” not. Second, authors’ bylines omitted. Third, authors failed note collaborated past John Ioannidis Vinay Prasad, discussed essay, also accompanying story. This, understand, also case similar opinion piece authors Undark magazine June. Fourth, authors disclose problematic issues raised design study co-authored John Ioannidis, notably study authors recruited study participants independent faculty Stanford said unable verify accuracy test.* biggest news year regarding virus Crossing bridge Rockwall marked difference Dallas. Exactly. Yessir! Pfizer one who’s testing immunocompromised adults, including HIV Hep B. They’re ones begun testing teens proof get data it’s sterilizing second injection. fuckton conjecture. 

And quite frankly, vaccines *are* ramp ride. bet ass they’re silver bullets. Berocca? Unpopular opinion: Trump said vaccine would available December called liar

He’s still shitty president. course, backlash vaccine adverse side effects, bad data, enough huge amount people wanting vaccinated, rendering purpose vaccine useless.

There's approving.

It shown politics pressure regulators, like happened USA. That's good, want politicians dictate health matter.

It's typical arrogant attitude, shit plan action pandemic, ridiculous herd immunity claims aft r blowing health care systems, rush vaccine approval try cover crap?

Careful lol thing high school kids However, vast majority deaths cars would people under, say, 60

Which is, course, false per link. number comparing 36,560 versus 3% 276,976 8309.

Which is, course, false per *your* link, clearly shows 19,361 deaths COVID age 55. 

To help math more, CDC automobile death chart shows roughly half deaths occur 55. take 36,560 automobile deaths 2018 divide 2, get 18,280. virtually number deaths COVID under-55 automobiles, caveat don’t full year COVID deaths, rather nine months. Always “America bad” narrative. It’s getting bit old. Dr Fauci said vaccines approved children. approval won’t happen months. FYI, trials don’t include 18 population. Holy shit Choose mask Covid-19 say, do. rules apply peasants... Yeah, lot strong ""conservative"" types think shut flu. thought masks, yet are. It’s two weeks since 52k people (100% capacity) watched rugby league game stadium Brisbane, Australia. COVID cases. wish poison anyone. trust vaccines read J&amp;J cross contamination horror stories throughout years. sworn buying products forever now. fabric people using giving rash minutes? Like something seriously going wrong there. Thank much info! skip quarantine negative test, least see there! Thanks again! Almost everything listed worst case scenario young healthy, 1 100 cases lead hospitalisation people 30’s fraction hospitalisations complications discharged hospital.

Obviously one quite sure long term effects yet, course still cautious won’t worrying vulnerable aren’t risk anymore, there’s evidence proving otherwise. it. me, I'll wait long necessary I'm afraid all. almost like argue based emotion rather facts way religious nutjobs developed world it’s even second thought

Most vaccines free US insurance. obviously making augment.

Of 13 countries higher death rates, think ignoring countries less 3000 deaths eliminates 4 add discussion anyway.

Next, would guess long time since Peru close Europe. Similarly Mexico, Argentina, Brazil Chile.

I hope find dismissive say Bosnia Herzegovina comparable USA terms goals expectations. 

That left superpower bottom 4 comparables. argument know make statement? 1b ""Essential Workers - Transportation"" I'm UK quite badly asthmatic. getting vaccine soon offered me. however go back ""normal"" I'm confident vaccine fully distributed effectively controlled spread virus.

I worry development gone vaccine. worries. logistics hands government, could well screw up, vaccine ends side effects unaware (as many medicines do) add fuel antivax fire.

With regard last concern though simple solution me. move toward open science, many labs moving towards anyway hope improve people's access science education, put nonsense rest. Think taverns. Plus lack empathy anyone else. Nah, vulnerable vaccinated alongside health care services. one care, Health services protected won’t chance overwhelming. Everyone say fuck it, way people let shitty virus take another year life Sinovac's probably gonna peer reviewed Indonesian Brazilian scientific communities, despite (presumably) lower standards funding, high publicity would still generate enough safety measures. countries populous make quality would hopefully compensate quantity  vaccines can’t mandatory. body choice Superspreader also move jerry used Tom's wife. Pennsylvania testing impossible unless symptoms.

second last Puerto Rico! testing: slightly better) I'm sure. Several people concerned ensure everyone particular group could get vaccinated should, classify people, bring positions dad's specifically. Explore global risk estimates

link Europe Canada overbought plans donate developing countries.  Yea ridiculous many people ""Phase 1"". Like, phase 1 many sub categories maybe split separate phases.

ATC likely 1b ""Essential Workers - Transportation"" life back normal May? I’m hoping yes Thanksgiving. 10-18 deaths day October, 40 per day early November hitting nearly 200 day 4 weeks later. we’re still hoping people listen guidelines they’ve ignored year.

Edit: word notice ""not distribution"" bottom... great. That's useful metric, also 3rd populous state. florida infected per capita? test more. course is. Maybe kept reading then, clearly acknowledge much one. case, referring one child. Please assume others uneducated topic. damages helpful open discourse. 1. Sweden's plan always wait vaccine, that's core strategy. idea however developing vaccine take time, therefore FHM government opted somewhat softer measures could hand kept longer time. Whether optimal strategy another question.
2. R0 2.5-3 assuming homogenous spread, 60-70% would enough herd immunity. reality, models over-simplified spread heterogenous - reality bit lower.
3. Herd immunity on/off switch, gradient. ""Herd immunity"" scientifically refers enough immunity completely go back normal without virus spreading. degree immunity population helps keep spread control, meaning whatever immunity inevitably happen helps slow spread serves complement measures social distancing like.
4. know much long-term immunity, indications AFAIK waning immunity among general population. Even antibodies disappear, T-cells helps body deal future infections much faster better.

So yes, herd immunity without vaccine. However, something *strive* for, would result huge amount deaths - Sweden's case could mean 25 - 50 000 dead example. Covid apps US pretty much completely useless, PA, 116 alerts people near someone covid, code healthcare provider enters positive entered 300 times 360k confirmed cases. Let’s see much America cares kids. blanket “open schools” solution opinion pandemic. early data, according article, virtual learning working keeping kids, teachers, staff safe spreading virus. 

Minority marginalized sections society missing data according article. It’s probably safe say educational losses occurring, possibly significant.

Here’s question. article mentions volunteer army tutors help students? volunteer? care education much want us believe, aren’t paying army tutors go reach kids communities becomes safe so?  left city suburbs US, though exactly result restrictions since behavior limited actually enforced. pandemic wiped lot benefits living city. Commute doesn’t matter cause I’m working home. I’m going concerts bars inside restaurants. left inconveniences living closely lot people. damee, would still lockdowns then. might stupid question gotta know. Lots luck that, country half people live reality. single documented case someone spreading Covid theater. gyms restaurants.

Because something like 70-80% infections can't traced all. Covid proven spread enclosed spaces/rooms especially people stay long time. Theaters gyms magical properties would prevent infection. Agreed schools though.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Maybe getting wires crossed. Needless say, likely biggest regulatory hurdle entire process (knock wood) share article anti-masker subreddit? really dumb? Ugur Sahin CNN. sounds positive vaccine. It’s hard pin R depends environmental factors (R NYC going different Montana), yeah, it’s high, like 2.3-2.8 narrowest estimate saw. Flus usually 1.x range covid nearly double

If makes feel better, mumps fucking 12 Plus, Biden won. vaccine work! Gotta go WAYYYY morty Available general public starting next week?? US they're saying general public likely get til late April earliest. hospital workers? would apply anyone healthcare? work small doctors office. but, but, .... get go Walmart, get go bowling alley. ICU ER nurses, physicians, patient facing staff 1aa. Followed patient facing staff 1ab.

But get feeling admins touched patient 30 years snag doses frontline staff get 60-70% still good, 60-70% cases prevented uptake vaccine high cases plummet. Also, remember Oxford vaccine administered using two 'full doses' efficacy ~60% (I believe) deaths hospitalisations observed anyone received vaccine passed away like Adequatekota announcement American Pancake Society, reads:

“Fuck waffles.” test positive COVID, pneumonia,” said. “I’m double amputee I’m diabetic, I’m dealing lot.”

And comedy shows? Play fire get burned. seriously covid another cold people die from. American exceptionalism toxic. Survive war, die here. I'd rather die blaze glory. get hopes down, get approved vaccines likely going go healthcare workers elderly. normal folk like me, likely wait little longer get shot.  basic research would conclude fact rationale worrying vaccine children 20 years.

The reason produced ""fast"" eyes paper work meetings bene globally scheduled countries working together. instead dragging steps 5 years, done steps timely manner. Nothing skipped rushed.

We also incredible tools artificial intelligence technologies allow us analyze data much quicker even 20 years ago.   40% never left USA, 11% never left state born in.  zero teacher ask teacher, tell that. closest friend teacher twenty years. 100% student parents even encourage student care school. Surprisingly, many don't. Also, constantly come new approaches teaching learning requires special unique format. Basically teachers jump hoops regular intervals higher thinks plan plan, style style magically make kids give shit suddenly care somehow miraculously make knowledgeable. I've watched friend go sorts stages burnout. Ultimately, says little teachers. even allow kids held back grade anymore. offer summer school. works city might different suburbs, doubt it. frankly used learn textbooks. teach textbooks anymore. years. use silly plans always changing. 

Most teachers try best, kids motivated, school basically babysitting. Again, nothing teachers. Everything individual kids, seem motivated learn. Add little tech toys plus social media, that's care about. Less school meeting review emergency use Thursday. doubt ppl scheduled following day injected assumption approval. Also, article saying shipment arrive still needs distributed takes time. many articles sensationalizing fact arriving physically different states. estimates saying actual injections start 1-2 weeks that.

It's sensationalizing taking facts context led shit storm us currently in. Think add that. everyone else vaccine, people risk people vaccinated? No? talking ""until start summer"" long time ""until Maple Leafs win Stanley Cup"" long time? Ten twelve days without recovery uncommon. Usually serious crash day 8-9, hopefully she’s past improving. reddit. need select subs surrounded complete twats. included. That's true UK all, there's (social) consequences vaccinated. Compared 10 years.... We're almost there. Thank you, I'm normally 97 99, spring hayfewer sometimes 'only' 95. think recall gets really dangerous 80. 

I'll keep 90 mind. Always reminded [this laughable - we've never vaccine developed 5 years let alone less 1 year.. We're working I’m deficient cause got COVID June fine. work sun 8 hours day shirtless boardshorts past 5 years. yeah I’m leaning towards deficient. possible side effects knocking people days. got first injection AZ trial yesterday call work today feel like shit. probably tomorrow too. Thank taking time provide thorough thoughtful reply! It’s truly appreciated :) :/ mean honestly need I'm sweating Nothing do. live far away car *this* close exploding can't afford repairs. really Zoom guy, feel it'll make depressed. Guess could cook something. Turning calling exactly help case either. think would better alot people simply emphasised none safety corners cut we've able produce vaccine quickly. difference anti vaxxer slightly skeptical. takes abit education explaining calm fears concerns may have. Seeing Constables elected officials, leeway determining office’s priorities (same Sheriffs) health care system collapse. everything else said pretty agreeable, health care system probably strained ever going back March mostly fine except localized spikes. think that's true, countries within EU able grant emergency approvals themselves. forget, UK still transition period, approved still bound EU rules Hard imagine life without covid everywhere. agree. world continue owned run narcissistic sociopaths completely disconnected reality.

Management close tighter grip employees, goddamn, way let employees proper work/life balance. Work home damned. must suffer commute cubicle anxiety every damn day makes life easier.

Next pandemic (hopefully another hundred years) learned nothing, millions die again. Never looking past tomorrow instead setting long term plan better well citizens economy.

To honest ""lockdown"" causes depression. miserably whole thing handled little government really cares people. Glad office called update white board one around read then.... everyone stays home home office, food stores electricity everyone starves death homes.  lot red tape cut this. average FDA submission waits 12 months review submission. Average priority review 8 months. include waiting time FDA determine application satisfies requirements review well. That's approval. Plus 60 days PRE-NDA application meeting. Plus 30 days start IND review. Plus time waiting FDA approve trial setup. time essentially slashed near 0. saved lot time. None safety. literally waiting look it. Lack Covid concern time Republican's Trickle-down ever worked know God hand science? 

I know. do, however, know science did. Wastewater testing early warning system. Bit late now. $600 week payments stay home nothing, absolute slap fact towards everyone kept society going Go bars, movie theaters, sporting events past 9 months? believe people expendable. feel war drugs? enough people vaccinated, chances getting virus minimal. Herd immunity protects too. 

And even get sick, chances meeting someone whose vaccination fails protect also minimal. Spot on. amazing positive world shit negative attitude. Test accuracy peak 8 days exposure, even then, 20% chance false negatives, see still follow routine precautions monitor symptoms. Good luck. Hopefully use data decision determine outdoor dining risk factor. mean they’ve already shipping vaccine US. I’m concerned local officials taking vaccine families people managing steal doses sell. vaccines valuable. Holding onto optimism third-time's charm December 2021 wedding &lt;3 heart disease diabetes contagious. COVID-19 is. can't get diabetes bar together, breathe. Test accuracy peak 8 days exposure, even then, 20% chance false negatives, see still follow routine precautions monitor symptoms. Good luck. avoid covid social distancing home office(which Im since start pandemic)

I want end like anyone else, also realise half assed shit makes things worse long run. Look europe didnt take lockdowns serious first wave we're paying price

We dont need vaccine end pandemic. lot countries already 0 cases vaccine think rubbing cover surface hand. TIL  understand people feel way. never felt like life.

I want return items person order tacos. peak SI Iirc isn’t 2-3 range masks social distancing aren’t equation?

The R summer right around 1. think take meaningful part population terms vaccination, plus innate number infections winter Covid spiking roof, next summer look lot better lot faster. already Walt Disney World vacay family planning five years everything went February. final days park ride home plane Monday surreal; never got masks got home Los Angeles, weird mixture panic, shock, ""meh"" mentality entire time, moreso flight home park. basically, ""Well, we're already we've already mingled many people, guess either die don't, so... Might well get plane head home quarantine while."" 

Even wonder got lucky either asymptomatic catch time. We've different scares since concerning covid, looking back, entire vacay guaranteed caught it. raw hospital bill vaccine? Huh? This. didn’t realize much missed leisurely shopping. 

Also, really miss restaurants. Amen. must always scientific mindset question anything clear.

If vaccine manufacturer tells us issue vaccine. One must always ask arrived conclusion.

I got back brother/sister. upvote clearly read comment all, you? Opening borders Americans implies opening borders Americans who've gotten vaccine. say I'm traveling tomorrow. Also, Americans getting vaccine next couple weeks, fyi. Source: best friend, who's pharmacist administering said vaccine.

Reddit infuriating sometimes people like nitpick every little comment sake prick.  yawn There’s reason don’t let family members victim decide punishment.

Redditors would even worse. much outrage. Oxford’s tried tested traditional? exactly. 1 viral vector vaccine approved human use approved 2019. Yeah, careful now. promise you, vaccine releases US much higher percentage anti-vaxers rest developed world. I'm arguing dumb people exist elsewhere, type stupidity noticeably prominent America. \*For three weeks April. actually understand pretending understand? Yes, planes, airports, long car rides still dangerous. 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day 21. ""

This info might somewhat outdated point, month old. example, typical symptom onset time believed 7.7 days now, 5. rest still relatively accurate, similar data spring, shift much spring summer shift much since. No. Yes, legit science. know Dr. Daniel Griffin discussed paper change TWiV. I’ll look paper. saw video EDM concert gone last year felt super sad. knew enjoyed them, realize would **yearn** work way crowd, even get beer spilled me.

Even small annoying things seem strangely nostalgic... almost appealing. 


I can't wait damn virus fuck off. Yes but, many died motorcycle crashes fell buildings? 

Republicans know lots like mountains evidence back-up assertions! Every day sub there's least 100 big-brained boys saying: ""But hundred-billion dollar pharmaceutical companies considered ... logistics issues?"" many college exchange students flew home Europe borders closed. would imagine number cases seeded time significant. Thank likewise ! New money maker makes money ""leaked"" like fucking mystery. Well, 2000 billion stimulus package America. Ah, makes sense. guess don’t see purpose leaving one’s house pay locked different one own. Define ""vast majority"" ""overwhelming"" percentages, convert %s actual population numbers, maybe I'll listen. 250,000 dead lockdown know sub right Fauci dead wrong about? Masks. sub advocated masks Fauci. Hell, sub advocated masks even even lied effectiveness preserve supply permanently damaged reputation. understand it, horribly shortsighted, lot damage short supply did, indisputable proof lie.  covid can't stay away brings whole household crashing around ears.  EXACTLY!! Although Brazilian case placebo group, three side effects stated caused vaccine. statement needs clarity scientific explanations. AstraZeneca SII's transparency poor.

Then news AstraZeneca phase 3 trial dosage mistakes SII suing volunteer makes situation difficult.

Why provide proper, detailed analysis issues reported volunteers. one vaccine. wishes know details side effects. 

This important boost confidence. biggest time saving Phase 3. waiting efficacy pandemic don’t need years enough people control group get virus. also stated Moderna’s CEO entered Phase 3 trials. lefts. Nice. Gotta start somewhere. they're going keep arresting everyone ignores laws want taken seriously we'll see businesses opening up. felt bones. work callcenter home im literally brain dead I'm 10 hour days. can't pull anything. Bought spin bike summer good couple months..and November hit bam, cant move. I'm confused saying sanitizers dismissed. simply available. Lysol, bleach, etc find stuff anywhere. Even products like Star-San Quatro tabs stock retailers price-gouged sites like eBay Amazon. even find Chlorhexidine farm supply stores, I'm pretty sure stuff proven ineffective early on.

The reason alcohol-based sanitizer took like distilleries allowed step produce fill market void. even put recipes making home since ingredients ones somewhat readily available pandemic took off. doc, sounds lot like post viral wear mask face shield home. Get good air filter. I've even see air filters wear. eat inside. 

You can't anything actions, something study, published late May BMJ Global Health, looked people households Beijing one person confirmed COVID-19. time, explains study co-author Raina MacIntyre, research already showing majority transmission virus happening inside households, China already culture mask wearing. study found households everyone wearing face mask indoors precaution knew anyone lived sick, risk transmission cut Shields Reduced Percentage Health Workers Infected Covid-19 19% money catch wouldn’t surprised see go 30$ ;) Putin orders large scale Covid-19 vaccination Russia. Hey Reddit! always 100% agree fauci questions asked. What’s got triggered question?

ETA: Plus, read original post, would see clearly stated working information given. Enjoy picking fight Internet someone else cause I’m taking second bite. Sending good wishes. Hang 💕 Cases reinfection uptick.....33% also way high estimate point. Article today said percentage could reach 1/3 Americans.....not now. one saying Sturgis caused increased cases NY Midwest. This. means vaccines me.

I also want go travelling partying tho. pace every nightclub go bankrupt people want get it. Things going back normal. virus eventually stop killing people effects last long time. Severe economic problems face US, know countries. Florida never disappoints!  would never that. Definitely get vaccinated, vaccine provides even better immunity disease. specifically designed train immune system.  Well wasn’t arguing essential vs non-essential, rather original comment said proposed plan would phase 1b essential workers 1c 65+/immunocompromised. isn’t 65+ group essential workers? Dudes right ,just saying Right, who's say random show clinic say ""Yeah I'm teacher"", get shot early. I'm curious verification steps (if any) people specific groups essential workers category. I'm low-key glad people planning getting it. means get dose. still argue people FB feed say ""fake news"".

Facebook needs stop letting misinformation spread much.  contest. Cutting close keep avoidable catastrophe turning irreversible calamity. one many reasons I’m waiting. I’ve masked since beginning simply continue people gain less lose give go.

I cannot afford become statistic.

No one America gives single fuck become one. Agree businessmen practices outed. behavior reckless. Sure, case attenuated vaccine actually attenuated. can't happen mRNA vaccine. error manufacturing oversight. course could still happen, could also happen anything rely manufactured. try negate point call work home political? Nah, I’m outraged. Everybody’s hypocrite covid stuff, criticizing everyone else every little thing they’re slipping themselves. believe voted close dining she’s genuinely concerned immense toll city suffer, went eat one last time closed she’s human liked place. Everybody would shitting blaming death toll voted keep open, anyway.  shows unhealthy America Me, rest siblings take turns visiting elderly parents window. 

We bring everything need, sit visit.

Its really thing have. Probably Facebook. hear something little dad, that’s usually source. know right? people stating insignificant number kids die compared don't. understand statistics point view, human point view, kid died. Period. parent see kid terminally ill die. I’m going explain obviously didn’t comprehend said first time. Go read book Currently kidney stones. fun part pain comes night. Nothing like stuck stairs middle night, hoping someone finds help upstairs. 

I would rather hit face Mike Tyson day deal this. 

For anyone wants know like, imagine someone made pee rock salt use sidewalk winter. salt never gets smaller. see map. 

On another note, people see 'HERE' bitching pointing fingers FUCKING TRAVELING HERE. Stay fuck home... Frig-off Randy? 

You're suspended. ""Socialist forms government like fascism""


... bruh response banned purely political, despite comment obviously purely political. Ironically, exactly proved point simply censorship conservative (or anything far left-wing) opinion It’s mess can’t even comprehend ripple effects (I predict) we’ll dealing decades. taken basic precautions acted like reasonable people pandemic, could get lives form resembling normal. think hip bursitis sedentary that’s nothing compared death destruction it’s one weird effects think others dealing well. could go out, wouldn’t happened, people won’t wear masks it’s worth risk. don’t know enough virus it’s long term effects Yep. I've known lots people given socially-distance-safe hobbies (cycling, hiking, climbing, fishing, etc.) year case might end ER. getting icy am, I'm terrified spraining ankle walking dog around neighborhood. I'm covid ward nurse. probably bunch subs tho. Take anything subjective: painting, dance, cooking, wine, beer, coffee, bodybuilding, etc.

The top 10% indistinguishable vast majority people. get closer top, differentiating factors competitors going arbitrary arcane... sometimes point average person might even enjoy features.

In bodybuilding, average person wants see big muscles, really also look vascularity dryness. Wine another good example. republican husband asks cite sources time express concern medical care overloaded. believe issue. baffling. Grocery Retail workers next. Pathetic they've treated whole ordeal.

Would loved see go strike truly see fucked country would be.

And no, I'm one, family jobs. “Tiger King” best documentary. Yep. remember kid freaked wanting know unconcerned. ""Meh. I've seen Sars, Mers, Ebola, panics. always overhyped."" still gives shit that. Cedarville Township 2,200 people Mackinac County 11,000 frankly smaller imagined still describe. fair, Huntsville ton techie DOD companies attract top talent. recall stint working there, Phd's per capita place U.S. (small population, lot math science geeks making stuff fly) already lived NYC first hand. 
No one deny Dakotas done themselves. articles coming months warned would end here. want live denial. That’s conscious choice. 

My strong sympathy healthcare workers people trying safe. I’m North Coast Oregon. aren’t sparsely populated SD. live popular area tourism. Goonies beach that. experience nature tends win even leading scientist. dec 15th receive shipments! Thank god bet happen check South Dakota would've fallen chart. Hint: actually fit chart. seriously think trump going somehow say fuck every democratic principle flip election. Furthermore, think people going stand let happen? He's going crown emperor? cant move arm lysol fuckers come anywhere near you. Ignoring legitimate issues bravery intelligence, ignorance. guaranteed death before, COVID signed death warrant. said many people, many healthy people get killed well. Putting head sand may make feel better, sad.  language CDC used healthcare personnel ""paid unpaid"" assume means volunteers. tends language used talk things apply healthcare personnel, 'paid unpaid' designation. Never heard bunch coworkers hospital dont want take vaccine. Unfortunately, understand care interpret scientific data afraid long term health issues believe apparent early on. arent anti vaxxers trumpsters. They're different backgrounds beliefs. worry much, parents got survived without real issues. prepared best tip give, I'm guessing Americans avoid going hospital costs. could stock dexamethasone, could lifesaver really get trouble. call Dakota. nah work course people state think totally different better people other. ND-SD rivalry thing. 

Frankly think give back Lakota/Dakota nation run. ""Lakota"" ""Dakota"" different pronunciations tribal name, means ""the allies."" One Sioux dialect letter ""L"" it, dialect not. pronunciation difference, political one. Honestly listening video pretty sad shows little people care. says anything says got went mother laws hoise. says mother law always careful, invited feeling sick. like people hear right things do, ignore them, wonder getting sick. app, previously available residents 18 older, used anyone 13 up. Parental permission required users 18.



Why would need parental permission kids 13 up? worst people think somehow figured something lifetime experts overlooked. Humanity dangerously stupid- “critical thinking” going downfall. I'm sorry seem disregarded sub. worth, light end tunnel getting brighter. listen doomsayers here, listen experts. vaccine coming sooner rather later.

I know help everything else life, hope helps least little. Sounds like picked shitty roommates citizens Governor South Dakota trying stop spread. 

Yeah that's pretty going judge Governor would look economy fared trying help. 

Not sure nuance trying make here. judge actions pandemic, one governor borderline schizophrenic one milquetoast administrator.  r/unexpectedoffice forget long-term care workers, many working covid units inside long-term-care SNF facilities. governor one use covid money advertisement? Hard tell many self-loathing Americans many CCP trolls. Nobody, aside maybe New Zealand, perfect response, I'd rather listen people capacity learn mistakes instead doubling down.

Exactly! people took approach would much, much better place. Unfortunately markets banks open 5 days week minimum. peasants show get canned. That’s entirely true. 90-95% isn’t necessarily bad. See post above. multiple factors take place. even movies released year besides shitty Netflix movies watch smashed drunk? 

What even win? almost like rest comment. comfort, 69 year old diabetic grandma completely pulled absolutely healthy days. strength reduced months past recovery. know varies everyone though. Asshole roommates though  Asymptomatic small children (pre-school primary school) stay home attend school activities someone family confirmed COVID-19. already effect older children.

This fucked previous advice ""Someone sick Covid house? Keep sending kids school, cares!""  fair, certain demographics congregating around certain online communities thing. none aside toilet paper Sold ever Canadian exceptionalism too.

I told Sweden brand, know fact China developing Chinese exceptionalism. HK stupidly exceptionalist too, TBH harder find country sort toxic exceptionalist complex. Belgium, perhaps? safe kids go school 500 kids people go Walmart hangout, I'm allowed spend time 6 family members?

Possibly hot take? wear mask okay, since still risk avoided. think three reasons ""isn't okay"" visit family.

1. sincerely doubt people wear masks.

Epidemiologists Qatar actually exactly describe, refer commenter's linked study. number reinfections almost certainly larger 24 however many confirmed reinfections, rate 0.01%. actually implies 10K+ like suggested, that's comparison 44 million confirmed recoveries, say nothing millions cases never detected. described rate, everyone world infected, 800,000 people world would susceptible reinfection. nothing average person worry about, totally expected disease like this. country even tried implement nationwide policy. states locked borders? enforced mandatory 2 week quarantine carried quarantine specific hotel /motel US citizens arriving home another country avoid spread? government can't even enforce mask mandate. get live country I'm ""foreigner"" talking shit country, seem making excuses countries gigantic failures also old sovereign citizens. same, think good idea Don’t forget bill gates ok like think prisoners required get vaccine rofl Infections ramping everywhere.

The promise got masks usage R0 would fall.

Mask usage extremely high multiple places----it made zero difference.


People like Fauci admit lied useful masking admit wrong large margin effectiveness. Jesus fuck. Apparently actually acknowledging danger global pandemic million people died (let alone permanent injuries) makes someone Nazi. Take look mirror. mean today?

I'm saying like gonna factually correct, need technically Well that's trying understand. first mRNA vaccines have, can't know long term effects quite time. willing bet nearly bad letting COVID ravage world, especially everything learning widespread effects body.

However, uncertainty breeds fear think lot people getting shouted anti-vax express fear. cool always point.

He never wrong this. well said, people see want see everyone shares experiences  Fucking hell. Generally ruled regardless asshole guvs order, courts take action mandates enforcement.

Similar shit played GA Kemp. think conflicts DeWine Ducey months ago broke.

A lot mayors, health boards, etc issued mandates knew enforce without losing authority. Exactly. would imagine every scientist focused cancer time, would lot less deadly (as big gains made field time). problem humanity lot issues deal with. Come on, know f*cks. ""Well, shut world lifetime DEADLY GLOBAL PANDEMIC, now?""

Like guy slasher film goes lake despite axe murderer chilling door. one read basically said since vaccine make people ill (particularly second dose), good idea potentially make entire healthcare service deliberately ill time, stagger doses. note vast majority hospitals similar staggering flu shot.

I think real issue (once again) going smaller rural areas. shots come trays set number doses; trays opened twice day limited number days; trays last limited number days even opened; vaccines vial used within six hours opening vial.

You're going end small, rural health services struggle get minimum number medical personnel together vaccinate, stagger doses? That's going hard. china? GOP trying impeach governor making vaccine. designed it, Pfizer making US third party contractors making Europe.

Biontech also producing vaccine Germany. newly acquired factory Marburg going produce 350 million doses mid 2021 want increased capacity 750 million doses. tone deaf be. economy. parent working minimum wage job cashier sudden kid home day every day, decision make, go work pay rent, stay home watch child. things moderation. support lockdowns assistance small businesses individual keep alive. i'm less supportive lockdowns throw people wolves. *sobs American* *If Americans choose right thing, virus might start get better!*

So...

Since never happened, never happen, start getting honest predictions, going happen Americans *wrong* thing?

Stop telling much better might get.

Instead, start making predictions assumptions Americans selfish, ignorant, short-sighted fools, dumb anything even help themselves, let alone anyone else.

Don't tell happens right thing... won't.

Instead, tell happens wrong thing, stupid thing, selfish thing.

Because that's we're actually going do.  whether reduce transmission. far know, none phase 3 trials attempted evaluate that. Hope anecdotal evidence matter nation wide. Everyone know lately that's needed test, went got one. 4 days way better back early months barely tested anyone. People still report doctors assumed Covid-19 bit never tested.



It almost June tested 500,000 people day.


And July 24 went 1 million tests day.


It middle September started consistently hitting 1 million tests several times back September testing, deniers trying claim herd Immunity cases seem bad looked like going down. guesstimate came out. Silly American, that’s credit cards !!! 


/s  😞 TLDR:
By call GP, healthcare worker. 
Also, 30M flu vaccinations winter. capacity there, depends production output. Yet another political decision, fuck already. MHRA started rolling review later yet they've already approved vaccine, EMA begun reviewing data weeks earlier yet come decision. Bureaucracy red-taping best! It’s brother also told mother (63 year old female) it, although mom unconfirmed test. mother described symptoms (28 year old male tested positive June). I’d like think I’m sensible person, there’s way I’ll wear mask outside pandemic. It’s uncomfortable. keeps others safe, don’t need to, won’t. 87, age oxy anyway Nah, I'm good. think ""getting back normal"" also includes constantly worrying accidentally killing friends family. know COVID-19 highly dangerous causes damage various organs even mild asymptomatic cases, leading potentially long-term effects ranging cardiac problems cognitive issues. also know vaccines hurried pretty rigorous trials year, major negative effects seen. point trying pick less risky option, definitely getting vaccinated. Prevent severe symptoms.. still spread virus though. Better nothing. What’s point comment? Yeah, don’t. I’m US people wear masks here, even college kids good breakdown. Thanks typing US coasting post-war economy Hollywood telling world America long-time. feel exceptional things #1 world things like obesity, health care costs per capita imprisonment. large segment population benefit riding backs choose right thing. saw social distancing see vaccines. fair, economy ruined. stock market fact roaring hitting new highs.

Poor people never invested getting fucked affect much. people saying “stay hole then” also getting vaccine.. fact they’re anti mask rules well. Masks help, arent 100%. Glad dodged bullet. thought well. can’t imagine side effects vaccine worse damn virus college kids arent wearing masks now, wont wear masks vaccine. sub running things needlessly negative Nonsense! merely tax credit given individuals fulfilling specific criteria towards mutual societal benefit, criteria received vaccination. incentives offered past things fitting home solar panels, buying electric vehicle, upgrading vehicle fuel-efficient model. credit ends reducing household's tax burden, resulting larger tax refund... tax refund difference provided fiscal stimulus check ahead tax filing deadline, pending proof vaccination verified time. 

That's - bigger tax refund extra steps. young maiden thought I'd sharing household parents siblings disgusting.

As someone world experience know multigenerational households normal around world.

Each generation brings unique skillsets table. Everyone contribute better quality life. Grandparents retired help grandchildren. Grandchildren provide assistance keep eye adding grandparents.

Less money spent individually allows person save more.

It option many consider. mad cow prion disease never go away even experiencing symptoms effects. surprise! Every single thing needed provided us government except person administer shot. listen here! pappy always drank good ole' lead-water spigot, god rest soul, dying ripe ole' age 36, buh gawd, I'll same! probably tested people long-term care homes, tested people 65+. stimulus, defunding education, expansion religious powers, anti progress, anti worker rights, anti science, anti clean energy.

I predict they'll approve next two weeks. Thank science science! seemingly keep saying ""disenfranchised"". Senate serves roll prevent large states controlling smaller states. democratic republic state anonymity Senate allows this. Also, thats Senate decides things like amendments Constitution admission Union. 

sorry get think unfair point dual chambered legislature. would house commons. Fuck hope not.

I think would take much bad reaction drive number people willing vaccinated threshold needed. Per Capita nothing population density. really. doable. could US without outbreaks?  take end January start showing community?

It spreading radar. Infectious is, there's way clinicians, doctors, researchers match occasional symptoms they'd come across virus newly able infect humans. handful infections seeded entire nation, would take enough community spread developed register anomaly data. covid infections (again, brand new, yet unknown) cloaked commonplace infections flus colds pneumonia cases, similar presentations, would've peak season back December. reason immunologists people like fauci willing get vaccinated. science understood.  Im sure sarcastic not, something needs addressing.  Can't see anything link. reddit said per capita right? Thanks trumpf. feel like makes sense take something seriously people information.  
That view back february. locking high ranking officials must serious, never really that, didnt seem much party (where masks sort did). Yeah. Mumps fucked with.

My senior project actually modeling 2014 Ohio State Mumps Outbreak math modeling class. Really cool stuff, math didn’t expect ever use again... Especially consider post-COVID symptoms thing.... long-haulers suffering brain fog, fatigue, anxiety, etc going away. know exact long-term effects COVID heart lung function, either, know damage. Thow floor, wuffly literally saved millions lives.  That’s neat analogy think messaging that's presented protection plan: ""I protector,"" ""I'm going protect family loved ones,"" likely win long run.

What studies show people won’t wear masks care protecting others. would assume so, contact covid surely seem help. Might possibly even recover said per capita account they're correlated linearly. [Must hard opinionated idiot, don’t even suggest Florida *deliberately* anything - inaccurate reporting. look red face got. Hooey feel heat here. line thinking like ""The brake pedal exists, lets mash accelerator drive towards rock face"" absolutely is. You’re pathetic sub. multitude problems countless deaths direct result hysterical lockdowns. sucks we’ll basically spent year inside keep baby getting covid—and I’m trying accept fact she’s probably going catch it. There’s (understandably) vaccine coming age group long time. also added ""Vaccinate 2% faster"" right, right, right? ingredients claim make? Holy water? Sure, you. know folks break rash face wear mask minutes time. people work environments extremely uncomfortable.

Masks bother me, wife fully embraced part fashion huge collection coordinate wardrobe, discount fact make people completely miserable. Part thinks minor radiation fallout nuke testing (seriously - actually major effect cancer rates US &amp; even exposed film thousands miles away) general toxic dumping/pollution understood bad certain things really done throughout 20th century corrupted good chunk gene pool generations subtle ways. maybe always like this. 3 weeks headline: Illinois becomes 4th state surpass 1 million Coronavirus cases.

You giving way way easily. much worse things going around world every day. unlike many problems, largely control fate, end sight. Sadly, unironically think totally right. pretty clear lot people never properly developed one reason another.

Fuck, can't imagine dying away family look screen. Death faced without loved ones there. Viral load much virus inside you. term looking viral dose. think mixing two things causes confusion different things scientific paper comes using wrong term people take wrong meaning it. vaccine already process. created MERS shelves. pulled back modified RNA SARS-CoV-2. They've already tested people, well 2-3 months study effects. longest ever taken adverse vaccine effect manifest something like 42-50 days (sorry remember exact number). state obvious, would unconstitutional (and ridiculously immoral) favor certain ethnicities. Prayers thoughts now? Maybe explains it.. lot misinformation this. thing want know whether immunization (via recovery vaccination) induce sterilizing immunity (which would prevent transmission). don’t know. won’t know quite time. 

The Qatar study gets thrown around lot “proof” reinfection rate low, serious flaws. 

Many respiratory viruses (including corona viruses responsible colds) induce sterilizing immunity. Findings mixed comes things would like see confirm sterilizing immunity. I’m arguing given individual better idea personal risk tolerance, risks they’re willing accept based tolerance level, freedom live lives line level risk acceptance, rather government entity telling must people care. Pandemic nihilism running deep. True think worthy discussion. said people's perceptions safety seem mostly based number deaths hospitalizations (even life expectancy otherwise deaths relatively low average). terms path back normalcy believe cutting deaths low numbers essentially requirement. work thing... work thing huge.

I healthy wf, 41, mother amazing 21yr old son... would've alone explanation. 

Covid19 real. matter live. 

Stand yourself. Stand them. Make rules. kick out. life worth it. 

You worth it. Stay safe. keep everyone alive. Kisses. Stories arent evidence idgaf. let know theres peer reviewed number. X % covid19 cases long haul covid.


Did know viral infections segment get long haul.. One concern healthcare workers could catch community; example, grocery store, household member. able work, bad everyone.

By vaccinating healthcare workers LTC residents first, hopefully cut number people need hospitalized, maintaining enough hospital (and EMS, LTC, etc.) staff care everyone still needs it. forget sneezing contests bars Good, good go California lower death per capita states. Kids bad transmitting virus almost unaffected it. They're low priority list. 100 percent. Nice guy, never met though scares me. Everyday hope dont get sick heaven forbid, car accident need go hospital. Needles problem, mRNA is. 1976 Swine Flu vaccine. serious health problems result line.

I truly think there’s valid argument consider 1) don’t know long term consequences 2) AFAIK mRNA approach, deemed safe, technically also “novel” vaccines, don’t actually know happen longer term. think know it’s theoretical point. pass congress 10000 years Senate disenfranchise states large populations. Fuck simple thing quit associating Senate population. satire point. fuck. FUCK months mask mandate? Thank you, that’s kind! hope find 1% ass mouth Thank you. Feeling good joining. Gonna donate money afterwards. science! two countries vet vaccines accepting findings vaccine makers, American regulators painstakingly reanalyze raw data trials validate results, poring regulators described thousands pages documents. Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner Food Drug Administration, called United States outlier comes rigor vaccine reviews, saying Tuesday F.D.A. “is one regulatory agencies world actually looks raw data.” People forget US literally afraid Soviet advanced science part reason space race trying keep innovation ""If everyone got sick, less people would get sick!"" 🙄 Especially (main, I'd come close saying only) mechanism long term vaccine effects (auto-immune reaction caused spike protein looking similar enough human protein) would caused infection itself... Yeah makes sense. missing context thread. You’ll taking US made vaccine anyway subreddit fear mongered cult. Talk drinking Kool-aid [archive link anyone trouble accessing article 1918 pandemic occurred century ago world dramatically different. People war plenty terrifying diseases worry extent pandemic’s death toll hidden governments people. 

If next pandemic occurs 2118 2120 world also dramatically different agree people focused rising sea levels, extreme weather, antibiotic resistant bacteria, etc. forgotten COVID-19. occurs next 30 years people ready embrace mask use, contact tracing, travel restrictions much quickly time. saw Asia suffered SARS 2002. also good data kinds things really prevented transmission (like masks closing indoor dining, rather disinfection) pandemic apply next one.

Also mention prions, would indeed scary could transmitted without coming direct contact brains. fortunately they’re brain proteins never going pandemic. ... maybe using expression :p? that’s simply false, reality living in? Majority world atheist. Majority reddit maybe that’s it. majority founders science also atheist. boss, ffs... Like Mayor Philadelphia driving Maryland avoid restrictions eat restaurant, Gavin Newsome ignoring social distancing restriction guidelines eat restaurant, Los Angeles County Supervisor Sheila Kuehl eating restaurant hours giving speech dangers eating restaurant? see. LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO Pandemic eradicated developed countries whole world (incl third world countries) vaccinated....because globalised/uber connected economy body safe connected word safe... really want know broader open  I'll sure go next time pretending restrictions perfect order pretend restrictions work all.

Masks social distancing perfect one claims are. individuals come raise likelihood coming contact someone infected, chances catching despite restrictions still goes up. 174 deaths, much higher peak April!   
Spain, France, Italy even UK higher daily deaths April. Can't wait beat ever-living shit TTUN next Saturday lol.

But cheers able us back game next year, likely hopelessly intoxicated haha probably lying idea got it. We’ve attached much shame getting covid people aren’t incentivized admit socializing distancing. Covid serious virus.

Normal life back people decide live normally, April. Likewise take care stay safe! Watching us play season, I’m honestly pretty glad game @ Washington canceled lol. seriously, hoping host guys Big House next fall look little bit competitive. 

It’s surreal deeply pandemic affected every single aspect lives, including college football world. lot friends TX Facebook feed. It’s baffling way living lives right now.  literally socializing everyone, holding parties events none pictures wearing masks even social distancing.  It’s disturbing alternate reality. US believe state state. titled, even recommendation. last time looked chart, teachers mentioned anywhere. Thanks! find way dismiss outlier relevant unfortunately. really matter news provide, wants dismiss this. think verification process appeals me. pass ""verification""? new ID? imprint arm? feel like many methods verification faked. thank you. fine since, next time I’ll try Clatsop, seem top anyways. 66% versus 88% don’t trust government map hasn’t thoroughly sharpied. Yes, lot viruses unfortunately everyone sick 2020 seems think it. I'd say someone lost sense taste smell, probably it. not, get antibody test assume still susceptible. capacity covid positive patients, jsut people sniffle assume covid? fucking traitor knowingly caused deaths quarter million Americans

FTFY Probably wording. asking different questions - essentially, know someone sick needed hospitalization (but didn’t die) ? Second question - know someone died Covid (irrelevant died)? 

Some people private things like illness hospitalization. Unless it’s posted social media told directly. really appropriate gossip subject. Whereas death get attention discussion. Maybe even put local news story obituary. I’m soooo close, like 5 min clatsop border. I’m Tillamook County.    remember Schumer Lightfoot dancing streets without mask*

No, literally never happened everyone knows it. reading comments covid overblown lot people it. lockdowns worse prevents people things like heart disease getting hospital die it, lockdowns killing people covid.

I'm sitting trying find logic. Logic still found. spread it. keep mind Phase 1b seniors health conditions essential workers. models show vaccinating essential workers first slow spread eliminating vectors would vaccinating seniors (many retired isolate) would. vaccinating potential vectors first save lives vaccinating vulnerable seniors.

Plus economic concerns, essential workers necessary economy, likely contract potentially spread virus interactions job, must stay open essential work. people delight getting away wearing mask? It’s fucking dangerous lemming. guess don’t care health friends family? Selfish morons. Thanks thanks. Vaccine trials rushed people reviewing political appointees. Science advanced past 100 years brains egos not. Somebody asked Easter, 2021 2022. I’ve seen many people say “A vaccine here. Covid over.” county commissioners Oregon traveled Hawaii governor asked everyone stay home.  Got diagnosed skin cancer recently, able get removed within week diagnosis. Glad dermatologists deal covid patients. thought exactly."
