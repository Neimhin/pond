0,2021-07-25,"   Fitting username   tens hundreds million children infected India couple months ago, I'm pretty sure would know point case obvious symptoms may seem familiar, mean serous consequences internally. Covid affects blood ""stickiness"" anything else, kind damage sometimes go undetected much later, serious. “Ultimately, don’t forget virus going endemic ever since beginning.”

Clearly obviously point time past unified persistent response virus could prevented virus becoming endemic. Reasonable people disagree point time exists. Objectively examples countries extremely good responses virus good policy good public response. can’t wash hands truly foreseeably US nation fucked pandemic response claiming always destined bad. post locked repeated rule-breaking comments. Please take time review [sub That's I'm doing, since started. want sympathy. want empathy. Yup, really un-ringing bell point. We’re abt Utah. 88%+ ICUs capacity (max function 85%). 700 healthcare jobs main hospital system can’t fill. media reports can’t add beds ICU like last year don’t enough nurses staff them. It’s bad. yet folks walk around like everything’s fine. I’m 14 weeks pregnant- god forbid something goes wrong labor, I’d like know there’s ICU bed care enough need it. that’s given right :( Fauci heading both, interestingly. sympathy, efficient safe solution social distance covid burns unvaccinated population. 

Covid going away hit immunity threshold. sniffles. ""Congestion"" common original. Yeah don’t buy innocent act second. Everyone knew big mask burning party green light unvaccinated walk around maskless breathe everyone, people pretended wasn’t terrible idea hoped get something it.  Highest day almost two month state. Awesome news.   seems know ""breakthrough case"" is.

I do. Can't imagine many people left USA given sheer amount reporting said poster worried breakthrough cases plausible (likely? guaranteed?) create evolutionary pressure (or whatever want call it) towards variants evade vaccines more. theory split population like US much better breeding grounds variants evade vaccine locations basically one vaccinated dominant variants become whatever effective unvaccinated people anything that's ultra effective real advantage variants without boon 

And disagree theory. Others thread explained limits (given realities viral mutation effectiveness vaccination) better can.

Also, think U/chrystelle she, he. Vitamin Exactly; strategy rely lockdowns didn’t plan proper vaccination strategy. thought could lockdown way this. Or: play stupid games, win stupid prizes getting little fat around waist. Same! two vacations already another one next month. masking since fully vaxxed never going back! They’re somehow *still* that, pretending vaccine numbers would much worse mask burning party incentive. Now, see actually happened it’s complete disaster, they’re totally sure would way worse based nothing deaths lagging indicator several weeks. know now? problem thinking still LOT responsible people got vaccines take care young kids elderly immune compromised folks. It’s incredibly frustrating parent toddler, knowing there’s vaccine available months yet still navigate work/groceries/etc everyone (vacc unvaccinated) “f it, pandemics over” attitude. It’s us young kids- estimates UK (pre delta variant mind you) suggest 7-30% kiddos get Covid go develop long Covid. don’t want son anyone else’s kiddo. Meanwhile theater YET begin Yup. 100% agtee  lead Memorial told last hole tested positive finish rest weekend.  isnt works. provide proof economic hardship couldnt pay remt. People cant pay get free rent I'm sure. 72% city fully vaccinated, week 1 130 tested positive, I'd bet good money majority would unvaccinated. fact 99% hospitalized die Covid unvaccinated. one would care Covid anymore meant get bed rest, mild case, need hospitalized. worst would bad cold. that's really matters end game this. Israel released study also. 80% vaccinated people got infected, spread infection others. pointed spelling also engaged substantively. Hearsay doesn’t make sense context rather see dying children picture Yeah, basically are. Little known fact: Weird Al brother alien known E.T. featured popular Spielberg documentary 80s. relation Alf. hope next woman disappoint understanding today sweet beautiful human What's interval shots? Seems like short. EU countries going well extended time shots, allowing people get first shot sooner. Vitamin deficiency, among others, could play significant role poorer immune function 3rd world children. talking about?

You criticized way spelled heresay / hearsay. Spellings used ways def.  Kinda like gov't plan ahead vaccinate people.  already insurance rates based life choices: Smoking, motorcycles, skydiving. refusing get lifesaving vaccination different? Anyone want go store grab ""New Years 2023"" sun glasses? Sub variants? Symbiosis organisms? whole debacle could EASILY avoided one simple gesture. Day one Trump come said pandemic serious threat. one way every American help resolve minimize threat ( sorry, to) mask. Let show wear mask every single moment I’m around Americans.

Done! End story.  stimulus would never pass. real option insurance companies pass cost unvaccinated. Premiums based life choices new thing. fact, fair way go it.  commented opinion.
Your opinion match mine.

I Texas, one three states 40% Delta. 

We'll find soon enough. Enforcement via tickets fines maybe? problem people already know vaccine way effective masking current data risk analysis people wear mask unless required (I one people) Ohhh saw it. stupid asshole. son’s condition genetic. I’ll tell you, parent medically fragile kid really see worst side humanity sometimes. prick. quick google shows inherited disorder, infectious disease.   know, pretend don’t political economic goals public health goals perfectly opposed former important latter. tell everybody pandemic make money betters crank good polling numbers guy charge, act surprised thing lying turns lie.  Thank you! started sore throat malaise Tuesday progressed bad cough, chest tightness, muscle aches, runny nose, fatigue headaches. He's actually today mostly spent day bed. I'm making wear mask common areas though. work service industry local vaccination rates lowest US. 

I still lingering effects getting covid March year. sent GP message evening asking need get tested LDH says one thing CDC says differently. many new cases vaccinated? many unvaccinated? Given guys paid, cares? That's pocket change. That's going anything. 

Not vaccinated? play. playing? team go. pandemic unvaxed. never wear mask again. I’m projecting needs onto anyone else expecting follow measures, one children conditions put 10x higher risk mortality. Even “normal” pneumonia hospital 2 weeks time.

Just months awkwardness telling family social group won’t attending anything indoors… hopefully back normal kids get it.  something would need go wrong. damages, can't sue. He'd need gotten shot. Nothing make risk 0. Though would seem bring damn close that. Especially parents vaccinated also. see repeat repeat people ""over covid"" ""don't care anymore"" constantly browse sub post threads they're it. Like, browsing coronavirus sub it? even care anymore? They're going need lot police enforce events then. Even Euro 2020 final, hundreds stormed stadium game took place. don’t fatuous, jeffrey Nope.  eligible allowed monumental government roll fuckup. aspirated swollen abdomen surgery

This quite different regular fart. get chance, LOTR extended release versions - 12 hrs :) ""way less 1%"" even 1 1000 great odds. Compared shot millions gotten safely.  proper term ""et al. ""

Named Weird Al short ""all things Al"". bc came India. Literally impossible vaccinate Totally agree. Glad one. Fauci concerned politics, concerned public health.

He'll praise DeSantis thinks get Americans vaccinated. Leave blasting ass others medical sphere.  Many Americans dummies lied reason Covid measures creeping back reality. like can’t. press release said “unvaccinated people quit wearing masks nobody ever going stop them,” outcome wouldn’t predictable. Rescinding mask guidance suicidally stupid, every thinking person knew going happen. trying mean here, can't understand nothing type thinking. us wear mask surges equate us rules around forever? 

I feel exactly way. like think choices either go back living like 2019 go full lockdown again. much room between! total cognitive distortion, black white thinking. problem. virus evolving slowly creep vaccine resistant strains. 6 months ago, fully vaccinated would fine, mask n95 required. now, delta variant potent potentially lethal. **The vaccine needs evolve virus** 

We might need upgraded booster shot couple months. Even double pfizer n95s it’s hard feel safe. really feel like virus bioengineered Wuhan CCP military scientists maximum potency. I’m healthcare worker. That’s entire reason able get mine back Jan/feb. point even though I’m young healthy I’m opposed getting booster regardless considered “low risk”. lot ppl use young healthy status reason cautious. trying make point I’m worried virus regardless  people can’t shots need another one. waiting Novavax. Really? guy many decades expertise? considered one top experts field entire planet?

Yeah, no, they're morons. concerns unfounded they're killing people rather learning admitting they're wrong. Killing people. Lots lots lots people dead morons. ok call morons. keep mind average career like 3 years. So, limited time make money.  First, sending love toward mom you. Second, never thought covid before, thank sharing us,. think mean conjecture, hearsay. Covid Classic fatality rate 10-15%.

MERS fatality rate 30%. Probably estimate though. Hit I'd love pfizer. mate also works vaccine distribution centre, weeks ago shit ton pfeizer get out, 40+. Apparently got Pfeizer month late, use real quick? said issue one knew vaccines available. done unvaccinated 40+ people area given text telling Pfeizer available area, obviously nothing like thats done. asked could take spot apparently couldn't. 2.22% 660k min. Also vaccines way cheaper therapedics. Tamiflu instance costs $60-$75 copay, $130-$250 plus admistration costs pocket. flu vaccine what, $20 pocket generally free 5 gift card using insurance?

Plus documented side effects vaccines nonexistent, therapeutics hard liver kidneys.

With effective vaccines COVID, brainer, contrarians gotta contrary. single average state tax take home would 400k. 

If fine post tax keep 170k. 

Pretax (probably case) take home fine 260k. Exactly, it, even solution besides ""it's muh freedom tuh spread it"".

They are:

- testing

Let know questions WDW experience post-COVID! kids mine can't get vaccinated yet, though, I'd prefer anti-vaxxers spread covid meantime. Poor air quality constant burning rain forest palm fruit oil? shot dark  Kids 12 tho. many possibilities cherry-pick stat supports opinions doubt return lockdown cards, barring scenario deadly escape variant develops, see mask mandates returning “serious states” precautionary measure Winter. mostly evangelical Christians, lie defy authority! /s There's nothing stopping San Francisco passing ordinance requiring proof vaccination enter public venue including grocery stores. CDC mandated (which challenged court cruise lines mostly following regardless) 95% vaccination rate cruises passengers. means 5% either kids 12 people exemption forms. 95% far herd immunity, meaning public health perspective, outbreaks likely happen risk large. 

Breakthrough cases definitely possibly interactions pretty much among vaccinated people makes viral load small breakthrough cases less likely anyway. true SARS MERS, sadly SARS2 arrived stay political issue. people asked even say politicized. per infraction. So, could get 10-20 infractions pretty quick. many more, upper class private safety bunkers islands, so....  Yup. We’re supposed worried children told children aren’t risk 1 year. ya bro, pretty stupid advise unmasking a) time wasnt known vax would protect us delta (thankfully ended effective time didnt know that) b) painfully obvious tell vaxed person unmask antivax antimaskers going take too. we've moving wrong direction since day. vaccines contain virus, immunocompromised received shots... likely they'll still get sick Covid, well, anything really. enormously frustrating difficult him.

Look two videos. depends include full time workers not.   makes sense then. ""No! fact, even slight breeze could disrupt fragile balance coronaviruses inside you!"" That's completely counterintuitive. 

First, hospital workers wear masks reason. There's physical distancing there. That's masks designed for!

Second, amount virus exposed matters. Obviously viruses get body, work harder fight off. Actually no... friends working Vic Health, proir lockdown 4 said, asking people going lunch time walks near Sandown, whether wanted Pfizer vaccine, throwing away. young 18-19 friend long hauler. walk stairs without totally breath.

The thing is, friend worrying much mom (who mental problems suicidal) friend free peace.

So, destressing (and knowing stressing yourself) important.

The anti-vax people emotional people stress body fears have. vaccinate cause much death, nervous system dysfunctional can't work properly.

I'm vaxxed. I'm healthy. I've begun wearing mask laws visiting ( vaxxed ) want laid week Delta. Hopefully people start realizing everyone risk excluding children UK got right. everyone offered shot, time move on. That's dominant strain

I wish US would UK say ""enough enough, go live lives need protect yourself.""   CDC always incompetent

wear masks, people... even vaxxed ""indes^truct^ible....."" ""I alternative facts"" lot people rearrange lives last year, homeschool children. can't imagine people - quit jobs stay home kids - rushing send kids back placing much stock promises unexpectedly forced again. laying pink mat looks pink....  cannot tolerate wearing mask length time

""cannot tolerate"" makes uncomfortable ""cannot tolerate"" experience actual harm Vax Break Tax Break. True, NL nowhere bad Japan. Check test rate per capita compare developed countries.

Covid 2 : Anti-Vaxxer Boogaloo. wondering last time study posted. asymptomatic effectiveness vaccine 39% 88% would prefer one two shot vaccines. initial trials showed effective, seen anything dispute now. Well good thing I'm one them.

Plenty public schools allow attend unless get vaccines mumps, rubella, measles. 

Are saying that's called 'mandatory' required federal government? That's really important distinction making here. 

The point comparing kinds vaccines covid fucking stupid. ""Oh would covid polio???"" Well people would get fucking vaccine.

Either part society don't. choose participate perfectly fair different rules fees pay. 

Being unvaccinated like premeditated drunk driving. also pay agents money well. 10% think.  military can’t make vaccine mandatory still emergency use exemption. FDA clears completely, believe become mandatory. think civilian side runs problem now. Mate, need get real world think easy, lol. Ppl hurt, lot them, governmental implementations divide populace. NATO ready throw hands! Mate I'm gonna honest you, million times likely trick light. I'm saying seeing things anything like that, sometimes light hit things right screw way eyes pick things up. people give vaccines seen thousands times they're staring right syringe injecting order get correct dosage there. think chances noticing pink incredibly low.



Again, saying head anything like that, everything see depends eyes perceive light reflected around you. totally possible lighting wherever messed way saw vaccine. Japan test much feel like many unreported deaths. live close major hospital near Tokyo there's way would able hide lot people dying. would hearing ambulance sirens day long.

No, since less 100% 12 million children exposed, claiming 25 would die 25+ already died smaller subset completely wrong. Precisely. works stringent measures, think they're sustainable. That's think vaccinated, need accept risk may get covid. decide risk worth it, need continue stay inside, that's realistic sustainable people. remember last summer judging people seeing friends going out, monster tbh. Personally, realize toxic mindset; living way last year way live horrible. friends loved socialize afraid shadow constantly scared safe. sometimes want ask feel scared drive, eat food crap injected them? mental health crisis deplorable one talks it. taking nice break subreddit came back couple days ago ptsd real.

Case point. 

[Fox quietly implemented version vaccine passport top personalities attack pennies. ban playing Relax That's made freedom speech. hard decide gets decide line is. maskless, vaccinated, period.

Umm, no. Disney World weekend. vaccinated still wore masks. “controlling crowds” “adhering honor code”. I’m sorry, total, two days, saw maybe total 10 guests wearing masks (my husband included). highly doubt allllll people vaccinated. 

It made us actually pretty mad Disney. social distancing whatsoever. required wear masks resort busses monorail. Long queue lines wrapped inside? mask. Food &amp; Wine pick-up windows? mask. Advent Health front check temperatures symptoms? None. 

We barely enjoyed trip. vaccinated individuals careful due Delta variant. honestly fun all. science supported removing masks. Now, something else happening. Cases surging over… vaccinated players different set rules Cloth masks aren’t 100% effective, even worn correctly. Distancing plus mask much effective. There’s even CDC cartoon examining this. Add folks don’t wear mask nose, pull sneeze, arrows make sense! Leaders get points gold stars react well crisis. successfully prevent crisis, nobody would know acknowledge triumphs. That’s happening short election cycles. chad vaccination protect Long Covid.

Do source this? heard vaccinated people anything serious mild symptoms days you’re vaccinated, useful? Don’t test positive? Super size please. Cloth masks aren’t 100% effective, even worn correctly. Distancing plus mask much effective. There’s even CDC cartoon examining this. Add folks don’t wear mask nose, pull sneeze, arrows make sense! think anti-vaxxers feel same? think story like might make wake up? 

I’m sure. Well SC ruled 1905 could forcibly vaccinated. debate whether legally still stands still law AFAIK.

But wont done reason vaccine passports wont done - politicians federal level stomach it.   Came say same.

Breakthrough cases ones end sending hospital anyway. one really understands.

60% UK hospitalizations Delta variant fully vaxxed. Chief Sci advisor UK said publicly. careful still. Err, lethality isn’t ***only*** thing changes within virus factor natural selection. you’ve said correct, lot factors deal infection transmission also aid strain’s survival, viruses obviously tend toward transmissible variants given enough time. Lethality, since it’s detriment strain’s survival, also usually decreases time well, hence trend noted original comment. However, like mentioned, it’s incredibly pronounced effect; look many age old viruses still killing people.

I don’t think many medical doctors arguing surge infections ***good*** decrease lethality described previous comment. process matter decades way long term really matter dealing short term surge cases. can’t speak parent comment think implied large amount time passes COVID mutate noticeably less lethal version.

Last year cloth masks shiznit way pandemic, year nothing? never know completely accurate figure, flu covid aren’t even close. Even huge margin error it’s even close. 

Anecdotally, I’ve never personally known many people die year thing (I’ve known 7 different ages states health), top people know facing long covid lingering effects. I’ve definitely never seen flu, even living huge city like ton people. agree ""good"" news Delta infectious quickly runs hosts infect. wave end fast came. country decent vaccination rate come minimal deaths.

I'm sorry hear dad - course nobody arguing restrictions wants happen though. Many banned countries actually similar higher percentage vaccinated people US, although personally think foolproof, negative test required entry US. 

Meanwhile, US still allows travel directly majority world's countries, many little vaccination experiencing surges delta themselves. inconsistencies make ban even harder swallow least US banning everyone, approach would consistent clear. stands, they're upholding policies made early 2020 quite frankly date. one day? thought Franklin Graham promoted vaccine earlier year......he got face eaten leopards stood stance. sad family get vaccinated.  much would delight me, think still overestimating mortality rate virus.

Well, understand half fuckin country filled cry baby conspiracy theorists. frankly read studies safe vaccinated people live maskless yeah 2 cents seriousness, delta variant might enough shift balance. deadly variant arrives, absolutely shift balance toward Democrats. flu doesn’t kill 500k+ Americans year……  takes around 5 weeks infection death coroner's certification, reporting numbers. 

So anybody reported dead early July, got infected late May. much delta US late May. that's latest time period numbers (it also includes time prior early July).   civil court, apparently. Whoops! 1st Amendment. I’m leaving tho. Yes, happened Brazil. children likely see outcomes poor backgrounds poor early life healthcare, making far susceptible health issues. However, also good predictor happen UK/US. saying vaccines work. Everyone either vaccinated given prc test 10% attendees turned away testing positive. pretty sure exactly healthcare experts saying along. textbook example herd immunity. 

The problem still anti-vax nothing idiots keeping thing going. point still stands. They're still financially ahead privelaged virtually everyone else, especially people age.

“The willfully unvaccinated”. literally excludes you. don’t understand clapping back me. conclude, available tests current knowledge tell us duration immunity protection reinfection, recent evidence suggests natural infection may provide similar protection symptomatic disease vaccination, least available follow period even bigger test group: open trial families want NOW.

If want wait months, that's unfortunate means they'll head back classrooms without best protection know make.

Still, waste time making available already board. saying following science wrong? somehow, virus follow laws science? Yes far far lower rate mild symptoms. Yeah waves 6ish weeks long 3ish in. One top posts thread cases falling UK...

5th post sub cases falling UK...

Yes, cases rising gets people scared post. like news falling cases. like 2 weeks only…we still month behind UK thus hopefully peak may 90,000 800,000 new cases

so actual confidence model, got it.

they clue UnitedHealth Group UNH -1.1% saw net income double $3.4 billion $6.7 billion Anthem's also grew two-fold, climbing $1.1 billion $2.3 billion. CVS Health owns health insurance provider Aetna addition brands including pharmaceutical companies added extra billion dollars net income second quarter year. Humana HUM -1%'s results also staggering net income $1.8 billion compared $940 million quarter 2019. end September, average margins across four markets remained relatively high (and loss ratios relatively low flat) compared point recent years. findings suggest many insurers remained profitable even COVID-related non-COVID care increased third quarter 2020. results individual group markets continue indicate commercial insurers going owe substantial rebates consumers next year Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medical Loss Ratio provision. Medicaid, application risk sharing arrangements many states place may ultimately reduce overall margins calculated quarterly data. coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic placed unprecedented financial stress US health care system,** including physician practices, emergency medical service systems, hospitals. **But one notable exception: health insurance companies. Sharp declines elective care pandemic reduced health care expenditures contributed earnings twice large earned last year.** example, UnitedHealth Group’s net income second quarter grew $3.4 billion 2019 $6.7 billion 2020 Anthem Inc’s net income increased $1.1 billion $2.3 billion. like imagine humanity gets point virus's completely eradicated. opposition crazy. I've debated many can't get someone ""young healthy"" get it, even talk long-covid, immunocompromised rely herd immunity, wanting ""flu"" couple weeks, falls deaf ears. fact 100% effective somehow gets interpreted matter take anyway...

Getting enough parents accept tough nut crack. 45 days, yes. 

It takes 15 days incubate 20 days longer contagious. Leaving 10 day buffer. point everyone wear masks get tested. sounds like good protection (or better protection) getting virus vaccines. efficacy vaccines also goes age.

So people virus maybe want get 2 shots vaccine well considered bad. know people put getting similar reasons...

My friend got early hit sick vaccine take nearly two weeks work, unpaid...not many people afford that.

Luckily get suck 2nd dose well. Co-workers put getting worried side effects taking work. Like yeah virus would also take work, people seem happy risk it. year without catching makes people bold guessb  restaurant job, conspiracy nut would hire me.  Yeah point vaccine ready next pandemic half country take it. Ya know, something tells weren’t serious ive kept mouth shut whole time. time speak out. fact AZ vaccine called chad vaccine fucking hilarious r/CovidAteMyFace really means someone long COVID able get reasonable accomodations per ADA. never did. single day south Florida lockdown roads clear people.  Glad got there. gish gallop force explain things likely already explained multiple times? honest better stuff do.   we’re seeing vocal push many public health voices reinstate many restrictions/mandates discarded months ago. would feel compelled matter you’re back boat?

Apparently, ""they"" able understand circumstances change. instance, new variant much transmissible. Texas open want somewhere festivals. 82% fully vaxxed 86% first dose 👍 62% children aged 12-15 first dose. shut health dept. crap Hmmm... whereas Iceland (amongst countries reporting breakthrough one month ago, country became first Europe lift domestic restrictions, however, 12 July, faced sharp spike COVID-19 cases first time since October, registering 355 new infections, despite 70% total population among vaccinated people, linked Delta variant virus, according health authorities. last spike country late October. Almost like libertarianism soft-pitched road neofeudal hell!

I, one, certainly glad local oligarchs interested ensuring public good places go, you? varies neighborhood. restaurants it’s basically 10%. grocery stores it’s still 75%, getting lower every day. Outside hardly anyone masking anymore, unless hopping one store another forgot take off.  analogy *also* demonstrates belief unfounded.

People wear sunscreen prefer mild inconvenience slightly sticky burned. also significant amount people appreciate benefits *not getting skin cancer* top getting burned.

You someone sits claims “only people thin skin get skin cancer, sunscreen pointless.” You’re wrong.

Healthy people get skin cancer healthy people get covid, healthy people die *all time.* Sunscreen vaccine minimal impact you, especially compared getting sunburn getting infected.

The vaccine comes unique benefits aren’t even considering. Covid, unlike sunburn, *is fucking contagious* getting vaccine help protect people *do* underlying health issues.

The vaccine, unlike sunscreen, also *permanent* physically don’t option selectively use sunscreen go outside. make choice ahead time *all* weather types. analogy intentionally incomplete it’s inconvenient admit refusing vaccine *also* like refusing sunscreen going beach don’t *also* night, even though there’s *downside* night well. Sure, don’t need sunscreen night, choosing use “sunscreen” need *isn’t physical option due biology* comes covid.

You also aren’t considering long term complications contracting Covid. It’s simple “you get sick week, either die fine.”

You *also* aren’t considering cost use healthcare resources people reason contract it, even survive, case preventable. way prevent infections inoculating people, every infection prevent lowers chances overloading healthcare system. rock whole flatten curve thing? learn nothing?

Let put way: don’t like sunscreen. It’s gross smells bad, reapply extra annoying, gets eyes it’s really uncomfortable. don’t even like go outside first place, it’s hot bugs there’s much find fun. don’t use sunscreen unless I’m going literally sun day know I’m gonna bad time don’t.

And yet, way benefits sunscreen permanently (maybe even “lifelong,” mostly permanently), free even didn’t sunscreen insurance, quick easy procedure, basically downsides, meant didn’t wear sunscreen hat days knew going sun, I’d get fucking sunscreen vaccine.

I probably wouldn’t even go outside probably wouldn’t even needed sunscreen vaccine, *why fuck would get it?* Good.

No shirt, shoes, vaxx, service. I'm also aware herd immunity works. Perhaps could expand comment? don’t get groceries? Ever see pharmacy? Five minutes protect others.  SEC conference Southern colleges. real good news US death rates remain low

Death rates rise bit cases do, CFR gonna \*way\* lower b/c older people highest vaccination rates. 

For example, UK, CFR Delta variant 0.2%, whereas 1.9% Alpha ([source pg. US bit behind elderly vaccination -- higher -- regardless, CFR going forward going substantially reduced  . mostly try get unvaccinated people wear masks making universal? 

Of course is. 

If CDC evidence vaccinated people needed mask would reinstated mandate already. almost like unvaccinated kids handy transmission route. Yep. “The chemtrails sky made good doctor hallucinate, that’s stumbled fell.” remember took religious studies class, “love one another” like quote Jesus canonical scholars could agree probably actually said. Humanity is…well don’t words. would take 45 days lockdown remove community spread. People want happen obvious people care going happen.  weird cultural phenomenon educated western country. I've like 20 various vaccinations lifetime, never thought twice it. hesitate vaccinate covid seeing economic ruin caused. Yet people choosing ditch die reason. United States fucked big time lose credibility public health bring back mask mandates. cannot get militant anti-mask, Anti-vaxxers mask up. Something new needs tried need move on. vast majority hospitalizations deaths unvaccinated people, honestly care drop dead point, road block progress. EU blanket ban makes sense last checked US still allowing visitors Indonesia. wish they'd either allow vaccinated (with test too) shut completely. Business usual suppose. think pandemic real....they care something happens personally. hope CDC looks UK Netherlands carefully attempting change guidance. waves fast-paced won’t cause much headache vaccinated areas, new guidance won’t even change anything.

Even mixed messaging 180’s fast paced level pandemic cause even distrust backfire. Better wait see imo. course natural immunity effective individual, get natural herd immunity US would require roughly 3-6 million deaths. Forgive that’s top preferred strategy. guys delicately hint maybe might want something. figure there's reason. understanding ongoing research question far possible say one way another. many vaccinated people getting sick right soon assess postviral illness. New York City require municipal workers vaccinated coronavirus time schools reopen mid-September face weekly testing, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday morning.

Last week, Mr. de Blasio announced similar mandate public health care workers — part effort speed vaccinations city faces third wave coronavirus cases driven spread Delta variant.

The new requirement apply roughly 340,000 city workers, including teachers police officers. Sept. 13 deadline, million students set return classrooms, shows importance reopening schools city’s recovery Mr. de Blasio’s legacy.

Speaking morning news conference, Mr. de Blasio, Democrat final year office, also reiterated call private employers set similar stronger vaccine mandates workers.

“September pivot point recovery,” Mr. de Blasio said, “and Sept. 13, first day school, every single city employee expected either vaccinated tested weekly.”

“Don’t wait,” said Dr. Dave Chokshi, city’s health commissioner, calling city employees get vaccinated sooner September deadline. “We need stronger medicine deal Delta, that’s taking steps today.”

Whether city’s unions fully board new mandate remains open question. Mr. de Blasio said acting sense urgency, city officials yet spoken municipal unions involved.

Those city spoken with, city officials said, reacted positively. United Federation Teachers signaled approval Monday.

“This approach puts emphasis vaccination, still allows personal choice provides additional safeguards regular testing,” Alison Gendar, spokeswoman teachers’ union, said statement.

The city’s largest public employees’ union, however, said Monday still steps taken would consent testing requirement.

“Weekly testing clearly subject mandatory bargaining,” Henry Garrido, executive director union, DC37, said statement. “New York City union town, cannot ignored.”

Nearly five million New York City residents received least one dose vaccine, speed inoculations slowed. Two million adult New Yorkers still unvaccinated. number virus cases risen 800 average per day, triple daily average late June.

Mr. de Blasio among first big-city mayors open schools in-person instruction last fall, announced May city’s public schools would reopen full-time live instruction September, remote learning option. made New York one first large school systems declare return fully normal schooling coming academic year.

But parents educators expressed anxiety recent weeks city’s average test-positivity rate ticked up. parents say worried new school year face major disruptions, last year, teachers say concerned returning classrooms cases rising.

The city’s education department estimates around 60 percent employees vaccinated, rate employees city’s public hospitals. Vaccination rates appear lower police department, administered vaccine 43 percent members. city’s fire department roughly 55 percent vaccination rate.

New York City’s vaccination rate whole 65 percent adults, better national average, neighborhoods rate 40 percent. 

City health hospital employees must vaccinated get tested weekly starting Aug. 2, mayor announced. Aug. 16, 45,000 city employees work congregate residential settings, like homeless shelters senior centers, same. mandate rest city employees goes effect first day school year.

Mr. de Blasio said city reinforce current rule requiring unvaccinated employees wear masks indoors times. rule require people show one-time proof vaccination get mask mandate.

The mayor also said city introducing new “NYC Covid Safe” app help employers keep track vaccination status weekly test results. New York State app, Excelsior Pass, similar function.

Mr. de Blasio said threat Delta variant made new steps city necessary.

“If someone unvaccinated, unfortunately, pose threat themselves, also greater chance spreading disease,” said. “September rubber hits road, make difference.” get Pfizer shot. However, covid many times likely create clotting issues across multiple organ systems J&amp;J shot.

This excuse avoid shot. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  welcome😊 absolutely right. polls differentiate hesitancy antagonism towards vaccine. told need booster either weeks ago. 

That's changing rather rapidly. 

And currently ""strongly considering"" mask mandate vaccinated health officials states/cities well. 

But hey, use common sense b/c ""health officials"" say so.  source delta symptoms showing sooner? heard that.  Read article bro guess username Louisiana, guess majority friends camp…. Lol That's ridiculous comment. works all. 610k+ dead US 4 million globally. 

Yeah sure could MUCH worse time 1 10 died covid would probably see little less resistance taking actions since would appear like movie pandemic. responded Long Covid remark previous comment. 

Just purely logical perspective get symptomatic disease vaccinated makes think get Long Covid?

Some ya'll intentionally obtuse. Let tell changed friendship. don’t get it. One cancer survivor well. feel like it’s hard relate them. Argh! It’s science people! incredible vaccine treatments reduce deaths well. never see hospitalizations deaths hit peaks pandemic. probably go slightly awhile correlate cases shouldn’t drastic overwhelm healthcare system hard early tools disposal. (Besides Missouri states way vaccinated).  spots already there. going pretty rough fall winter getting there. It’s spotty right now. thought majority Americans would normalize mask wearing don’t know Americans well.

Yeah, social norm changes accompanied kind push back. Seat belts fought enthusiastically decade, say. Motorcyclists fought tooth-and-nail helmet laws. difficult convince smokers move smoking outside.

I remember reading huge campaign convince pedestrians confine sidewalks cars first introduced, cars would exclusive use roads. unpopular took long time establish.

It looks like expecting sorts changes go smoothly everyone appreciative works.  Early on, yes, better nothing. also year data shows masks work well ones don’t. may right... would suggest delta significantly less deadly previous strains. would contradict preliminary reports, would good news planet. need new friends I’m religious stretch, outside perspective wearing mask getting vaccinated you’re able goes directly “Love thy neighbor would thyself”, least opinion does.  Hhhmmm. wonder happened?  Hmm... Lost initially link, interesting idea... Veganism growing good reason. think correlation. 

I'm consumption less meat society making expensive, may way that. both, encouraging people get vaxed eat less meat.

I think giving people choice best. Unfortunately perhaps fortunately driven wallets. charged unvaccinated corona testing able take part many consider standard societal activities, believe many choose get vaccinated. Due ppl cheap lazy. 

I think meat, charge use subsidize alternatives, lab meat lentil burgers whatever latest awesome tasting option is. 

So yeah think could applied across board, even considering climate change veganism, current distraction coronavirus. 
 #AutonomyEndsWheretheHealthandSafetyofOthersBegins. Translation: They're going go bars restaurants even spite experts. Yay? three adults tested positive (both unvaccinated...and side family were) recovered. Thanks asking.   Go UK! Show us it’s done! Here's good video talking  gov lots weird shit expedient.  smart, caring brave. :)  went cinema watch Quiet Place II. bit quiet everything back normal respects. Dining fully open, activities open albeit indoor ones masks, shopping, air travel domestically. left can’t do? world nowhere near vaccinating enough people. mere existence vaccines enough. people work. Here's good sample Yes that’s factor comes cases declining. India barely population vaccinated. COVID it’s Delta variant ran rampant population cases fell cliff. don’t know long remain way U.S. advantage good portion population atleast partially vaccinated. Christ stupid mindset. 

“Here, money pwetty please consider putting fellow human beings risk thank much”

Nah fuck that. Carrot ain’t working, break stick.  agree virus going anywhere.

We amazing vaccines turn deadly virus mild inconvenience nearly everybody. either choose get vaccine, get gamble life. I'm done protecting people protect themselves.  try one Europe could closed months end. people please stop making Australia's response pandemic somehow disaster leaving everything open somehow right move. It’s weird lot people worship Jesus think things please judged but…dont Stanley Cup playoffs weren’t long ago, lol, everyone already forget double-vaccinated Habs coach caught Covid Vegas series Knights? honestly following evidence this. think soon rule explanation out. fuck knows, accepting open arms Misinformation Facebook literally killing people. ask list every study. one credible. I'm anti-vax mate. I've plenty vaccines thanks. Nothing wrong using bit critical thinking comes stuff rather believing everything we're fed. wish people pointed more. biggest refused vaccines elderly conservatives, young people. Schools closed Euros over, plus who's going pub watch Olympics? Who's even watching Olympics? I've caught online times, highlights. Olympics chatter social media non-existent, among friends. much is. don’t know exact date dropped it’s minute now. Well, here’s data. dose rates gone hair, decline stopped, it’s like unvaccinated clamoring get shot. lot folks spent year aligning identity around disinformation. That’s going change overnight.      Unfortunately good chunk population every country tends act like donkeys. Germany Italy around level (61 vs. 62%) increasing pace well. Italy faring slightly better cause announced new covid pass system starting August lot people rushed book vaccine appointment. According many people subreddit absolutely makes enormous difference   drops pretty decline last Monday's reportef case number today's. That's beautiful. wish father best :)  information/theories cases seem dropping sharply, rather levelling drop like we've seen peaks?  friend \~3 different clotting issues nurse. I'm sure serious getting Covid avoid J&amp;J (Which believe resolved). That's really main thought medical exemptions.  I'm sure lots people hospital right thought healthy young worry getting vaxxed. Canada we’re still trying figure logic out… we’re opening vaccinated Americans they’re opening land border us, despite higher vaccination rates. Yet… it’s possible fly countries basically pandemic long, even unvaccinated… it’s possible right despite “closure.” That’ll also interesting time, since know lot workplaces DC (including mine) aimed hybrid-style return office around time. could see getting pushed back month though. 

Either way I’m moving sunny apartment September working home may slightly less miserable me! come 7 foot Wookie live 2 foot Ewoks? not. Make. Sense. Huh. didn’t know different countries spacing 1st &amp; 2nd doses differently. “low chance getting &amp; spreading” well &amp; good family tests positive. 

I’m still extremely grateful getting vaccine. It’s freaking miracle. yeah - lot previously took granted seems changing swiftly spread delta variant. wanna make sure people remember &amp; try stay ahead things, wear masks, etc till know this. Good health &amp; ✌️ think everyone got wrong idea comment lol. 100% agree. comment meant read “I’m glad require vaccination hope masking required”  Oh good, unvaccinated people totally listen experts. 55.8% entire population fully vaccinated. play around numbers (say, include 18+ include one dose) official tally fully vaccinated percentage entire population 55.8% two days ago purely political point. lives political tools democrats republicans use get power 2022. Based zero science. Voted democrat really regret now. Party follows science ass.

Next step tents outside mobile morgue refrigerated trucks. getting vaccinated get back pre-covid normal know point was. makes sense, half population vaccinated probably going take much time Delta burn unvaccinated population represents decent level immunity end well. That’s kind number need revised based current numbers.   get saying, mean it. :(

...

But time (and lighter note) phrase ""storing corpses churches"" actually unusual all. That's, actually fairly normal think it. (One example, among many: Need numbers, 200% 0 still 0. Interesting, Israel immunity seems lower. Seems like 8-12 weeks coming effective. least, that's accepted reasoning differences Israel USA vaccine effectiveness moment. currently covid. sinuses congested I'm slightly achy I'm otherwise ok. I'm vaccinated. wife mom last week, also vaccinated, they're also ok. vaccinated, knows, might MUCH different. mean wear mask 30 seconds takes go table group taking rest time? Restaurants bars places masking generally useless. Why? really funny. exercising rights getting infected. sue anti-vaccers harming them.

It like bacteria feeds itself. Absolutely right. Let ask, hypothetically test one technician day didn’t answer, would try reschedule? prior vaccine never go hospital clinic? recent study Cell added many already cited: infected individuals likely better immunity vaccinated individuals multiple antigenic targets cited study 'Freedom Day' really opened nightclubs dropped mask mandate, anecdotal personal experience still obeyed 3/4 people voluntarily anyway. result think impact bit overstated, many people living pretty normally couple months.

Plus delta known show symptoms little two three days, two weeks time hospitalisation death, we'd expect seeing start surge right now. Two dose Pfizer completed mid-April I'm worried December, though schools starting back masking taking precautionary measures public. really want breakthrough statistic. really looking forward getting back gym public events, I'm state 34% vaccination that's pipe dream moment. mRNA early vaccinated need boosters September, I'm waiting focusing getting flu vaccine etc. meantime least two week wait vaccines covid vaccines. Hopefully we'll better guidance plans boosters fall. Even Gavin Newsome Cuomo announced science panels evaluate vaccines Trump FDA approved them. giant waste money panels gave greenlight within hours FDA giving EUA. giant publicity stunt.  wonder whether they’re true anti-vax believers cynically see strategic opportunity serving anti-vax biases willing accept risk. retail stores like CVS Target require proof vaccination, might kill two birds one stone stopping theft rings going stealing $899 dollars worth stuff walking like past months now. 

I making giant assumption folks vaccinated. They'll gone soon. Sad, true. agree, want people take vaccine forcing bad idea. wouldn’t know, don’t live US. ENTIRE YEAR. system US divided state? can't single verification system use nationwide? Maybe time give idea whole 50 states business letting state decide matters impact entire nation. Even get something now, we'll probably need different app/card state planning use it, people states still SOL. live PA. vaccine passport system yet NY Excelsior. got vaccine can't even opt system even wanted to. flimsy cards forged &amp; probably lost/unreadable year one pull present proof everywhere. Something better national needs developed. Again, year prepare this.  Show magnetic?

That'd humorous retort anti-vaxxers claim shed ""vax particles"". Test see I'm magnetic! Or, get 5G signal me? Dumbasses Indiana tracking too, click ""breakthrough"" i

But think issue still random testing unvaxxed people, vaxxed, right?

So vaxxed asymptomatic light infection big chance never found.  wont get sick enough get tested, wont get called tested anywhere.

But still testing unvaxxed people, still finding asymptomatic infections crowd. thing happened India month Kumbh Mela. possibility. work one?  also lot people mild symptoms maybe realize covid. family it, jf mom lost sense taste, none us would gotten tested. I'm sure *all* unvaxxed believe that, public purveyors anti-vax talking points also definitely say kind thing well. Perfect. Please flock together. stop bothering hospitals believe in, catch it.

My preference, set reservation anti-vacers. Give large space, tall fences let interact wish.

Drop back 5 years time see anyone survived. mean, managed ignorant everything happened would stop now?  Maybe means ""Biden people"" would chosen sweet embrace death four years Trump. certainly would passed mind. US. 5-11.  It’s looming liability lawsuits Yea, age well. Proving negative FTW. people stupid allowed cook food. comes covid, US higher vaccine hesitancy.

Covid vaccine hesitancy directly correlated far along vaccination campaign is, US historically ahead would seem less vaccine hesitant, account France essentially less vaccine hesitantcy per vaccination campaign milestone certainly end better US. Yes. Yes does.  vaccines still elicit longer term immune responses less specific spike protein shape current Nabs. remember that. downvotes lot us got felt going go well. fair, Kamala Harris, campaign, said trust vaccine trust FDA approval Trump. stupid thing say stupid thing say now.

US? 12 compromised immune system reason unvaxxed unless choice. free widely available. course it’s Huntington Beach 🤮 think netherlands portugal increased restriction. suprise. think real issue entire notion people working infectious diseases waltzing right lab soon they're done.

Hundreds children Indonesia died coronavirus recent weeks, many age 5, mortality rate greater country one challenges idea children face minimal risk Covid-19, doctors say.
The deaths, 100 week month, come Indonesia confronts biggest surge yet coronavirus cases — leaders face mounting criticism unprepared slow act.
“Our numbers highest world,” head Indonesian Pediatric Society, Dr. Aman Bhakti Pulungan, said death rate. “Why giving best children?”
The jump child deaths coincides surge Delta variant, swept Southeast Asia, vaccination rates low, causing record outbreaks Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar Vietnam well.

In donesia, world’s fourth-most populous nation, month overtook India Brazil number daily cases, becoming new epicenter pandemic. government reported nearly 50,000 new infections 1,566 deaths among entire population Friday.
Based reports pediatricians, children make 12.5 percent country’s confirmed cases, increase previous months, said Dr. Aman, executive director pediatric association. 150 children died Covid-19 week July 12 alone, said, half recent deaths involving younger 5.

Over all, Indonesia reported three million cases 83,000 deaths, health experts say actual figures many times higher testing limited. Critics say nation’s leaders relegated health experts secondary role combating spread virus, even Delta variant devastated India earlier year.

“The government never taken pandemic seriously beginning,” said Alexander Raymond Arifianto, research fellow S. Rajaratnam School International Studies Singapore. “The voice actual experts best handle pandemic simply heard.”
On Sunday, Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, extended restrictions gatherings commerce Aug. 2 relaxed others, allowing traditional markets resume operating usual strict health protocols.
Mr. Joko, former businessman reluctant impose lockdowns slow economy, said would begin lifting restrictions case numbers declined.

“With hard work together, God willing, soon free Covid 19 socio-economic activities community return normal,” said Sunday evening.

More 800 children Indonesia age 18 died virus since pandemic began, Dr. Aman said, majority deaths occurred past month.
“Until now, children hidden victims pandemic,” said Dr. Yasir Arafat, Asia health adviser nonprofit group Save Children. “Not anymore.”

“Not countries like Indonesia seeing record numbers children dying virus,” Dr. Yasir said, “but we’re also seeing alarming rise children missing routine vaccinations nutrition services critical survival, ring major alarm bells.”

Health experts said number factors contributed high number deaths among children. could vulnerable virus underlying health conditions malnutrition, obesity, diabetes heart disease, doctors said.

The country’s low vaccination rate another factor. 16 percent Indonesians received one dose 6 percent fully vaccinated, according World Data project University Oxford. Like countries, Indonesia vaccinate children 12 recently began vaccinating 12 18.
At time, many hospitals stretched beyond limit recent surge cases, patients waiting hallways overflow tents bed ward open. hospitals set care children Covid.

If children get sick, going take them?” Dr. Aman asked. “To emergency room? Emergency wards overwhelmed adults. seen past couple weeks, people wait emergency room days. expect children go that?”

With hospitals capacity, two-thirds adult patients isolation home, increases chance children infected, said Edhie Rahmat, executive director Indonesia nonprofit health-care group Project HOPE.
Infants also put risk tradition friends neighbors visiting newborn’s home celebrate birth, said.
“These newborns released hospitals negative Covid-19 status, later contracting Covid-19 dying visited neighbors extended family members,” Mr. Edhie said. “It heartbreaking.”

Dr. Aman said educating public getting people comply health protocols would good start protecting children.
“It goes back adults,” said. “The adults stubborn ones. refuse wear mask. bring children crowded places.”

Indonesia, vast archipelago 17,500 islands, also ranks bottom third among nations testing, said Dr. Windhu Purnomo, lecturer epidemiology Airlangga University Surabaya.

The country’s health minister, Budi Gunadi Sadikin, set goal 400,000 tests day. country never come close figure. Last week, number dipped 115,000.
Positive tests averaging 30 percent, sign virus spreading rapidly enough tests conducted. World Health Organization recommends positivity rate 5 percent.
“If evaluate numbers, means emergency restrictions haven’t working,” Dr. Windhu said.
Luhut Pandjaitan, coordinating minister maritime affairs investment perhaps Mr. Joko’s trusted adviser, leading country’s Covid-19 response. pledged last week government would increase testing tracing provide isolation centers, especially densely populated neighborhoods.

“Believe best, Delta variant difficult situation reality it,” Mr. Luhut told reporters. “No country world claim overcome it.” kind moot current pandemic causing virus well known often encountered families viruses virus family would common enough least baseline immunity among population prevent pandemic?  nah dude lets go fake space billion dollar planes...../s Malta's recent spike cases, going 25 2,500 active casss month thanks incompetent government opening unvaccinated teen students given money come ""party island"".

It's going now, imposing restrictions allowed in. Florida care lol. We're screwed. going lie, confused believe vaccines elicit similar long term immune response natural immunity. maybe vaccines would significantly less effective crazy variant future, still much better nothing.

Why would fallout? Vaccines exactly supposed do, even situation.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  absolutely rooted science. Delta variant makes vaccines slightly less effective, makes natural immunity WAY less effective get worse dominant variant gets variant someone infected with.

Also funny thing vax supply. problem much waste countries surplus selfishness. matter donate much selfish. money vaccinate every citizen launch worldwide vaccination effort simply won't. Surplus result expired vaccines, donations  This. incentive really goal, blew it.  need enemy feel right position common sense data proves am.

Newsflash, trash. 😁 this, please!

If unvaccinated, part. free, substantially reduces chances getting nasty disease, makes less likely pass around you.

There's excuses point  straight missed entire year mentioned many people CANNOT get vaccinated aren’t protected antivaxx idiots? past 6 months “the less people vaccinated mutate eventually lead vaccines effective” every news headline?  still put money soft recommendation anything rather sort mandate. Yea took J fizer 100% protected fronts. Perfect. Reservations easier get rest us! sub fetish silly measures, anyone thinks governments give domestic vaccination passports pandemic pretty much proper silly. significant number window lickers 

I'm one ""window lickers"" thanks!

I dont like synthetic stuff body. especially dont love idea lifetime auto-renew subscription.

I would actually like self infect covid develop natural immunity. said whole way. I'm young healthy, risk minimal.

But funny thing honestly havent able figure get sick past year. Sigh. wish clear. step brother wife got COVID January, super mild cases. refuse get vaccinated now. I’m comfortable seeing masks outdoors (I young children they). I’m sure holidays play likely pissed don’t open home accept unvaccinated selves. thinking could maybe feel ok natural immunity don’t know. Ppl bother think means future. ok crossing line btch later agree it. Proceed downvote... kids would angry could read Say what? quarantining prevent spreading virus otherwise joke.  Ok thanks links made the... interesting decision read John Barry’s “the great influenza” first two weeks quarantine March 2020. Hiiiighy recommend it, it’s fantastically written researched, surreal read time. Travel quarantine *required* long hotel system came place. People *required* quarantine home. YUP. seriously, even initial height pandemic I'd always think, everyone masked tf matter way walk? Lifting mask mandates vaccine refusal made inevitable. I've got Australian friend who's trying desperately come US months upon months see fiance. He's fully vaccinated, happy provide clear test upon return, begrudgingly ok expensive lengthy hotel quarantine return... still got noped last week government.

I'm back wearing masks (not outside though) super cautious friend. exhausting though I've even moment told ""you know get get it"" seriously want deal long lasting effects even get sick general. fully vaccinated person confirmed antibodies/t-cell immunity/etc. mean can’t get COVID even exposed repeatedly? exposure still pose risk breakthrough? exactly punishing vaccinated people due irresponsibility unvaccinated???

 Know audience lol.  Without knowing proportion vaccinated unvaccinated potentially exposed, statements like 70% cases amongst vaccinated somewhat meaningless. made choice. isn’t hard. Everyone gets make choice live decision.  Even current form be. week ago shut everything something like whopping dozen cases. Even every single person vaccinated there's always going people catch covid fault own, much like flu vaccines perfect either. going keep shutting things over? Relevant (Very 99% Americans aren’t taking precautions anymore wear full PPE everywhere go. Hardhat, gloves, steel-toed boots. include Delta it’s particularly relevant right Exactly. bullshit we've got going unfair vaccinated, responsible right thing. already huge groups people protesting masks vaccines, hehe. technically already huge groups people going insane. 

But numbers grow exponentially vaccines stop working. People simply turn back science accept whatever fate brings.... massive exponential spread. 

And there, knows. huge factor keeping society running properly everyone believes get something road behaving properly (retirement, enjoying hobbies, etc.). people start caring short term, man oh man behavior change worse. Australia New Zealand spent far less time isolated, they've done proper lockdowns. rest world shutdown, New Zealand still hosting large sporting events.


They're behind vaccinations spend much money vaccines - nearly many cases urgent...because they've properly handled covid. Also importantly teams get enough players play game entire team opponent loses pay check week. That's real quick way creat team social pressure get shot. Also unvaccinated players take place dinners andust stay quarantine road trips. pool, beach, masks stay whole time travel. Well would prefer investigation instead one person saying nothing else could do. Putting covid infected patient nursing homes people COVID surely help overwhelmed. certainly facilities set handle covid patients. patients could saved solution stick nursing homes spread people.

Please explain Well I'd prefer think inverse Dunning-Kruger Imposter Syndrome.

Telling vaccinated people need mask supposed reinforce vaccine effective.

Following line logic, people get vaccine self preservation longer need wear mask.

The logic self preservation sound.
Most individuals looking preserve life health already gotten vaccine.

The problem remain attempting preserve identity.

Some examples:
- I'm young healthy
- ""natural"" immune system
- trust government
- get flu shots got one felt really sick
- I'm god warrior
- entire thing political hoax

For people getting vaccine chips away identity, way kills piece (or lot) are. suspect number people partially vaccinated highly counted US. lot people got first second shots different places whose databases synch one another, example due moving, actually counted two people one shot rather correctly recorded one fully vaccinated person. was/is always endgame. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I’ve always thought good take zinc regularly (have taking close daily year).  oh wow thats petty infections rare even rare get anything mild symptoms. go sex someone HIV positive 1980 wear condom it. I'll stick monogamous. I’m vaccinated. Never wearing mask again. Sorry sorry. decade two... Smh. It'll endemic point. already declared next year latest.

People going continue die virus, that's cold hard truth. healthcare system needs adapt, getting people go extreme measures again. bought real 3M ones Amazon. They're exactly hard get right now.  way get half country vaccinate themselves.

We saw small boosts things like vaccine lotteries. try another stimulus check incentive put test? I’m sorry isn’t entirely true, especially variant.

Very, unlikely. But, someone “mild” COVID, tell right still really bad time even don’t end morgue. sense smell still isn’t right year later quite frankly consider lucky. 

Also, accidentally made point failure public messaging US truly believe posted.

LA right now, 20% infections breakthrough infection. guess would 20% 20%? 4%. Rule #1: Cardio pure speculation - maybe new variant :/ Nice try moron. Care provide evidence?

IMO that's best way get biggest number holdouts right thing. get onboard, nothing that. Israelis keep putting press releases asserting vaccines severely impacted Delta effectiveness wanes time. However, Canadian British scientists say case. 

The Israelis published data peer reviewed study scientific journal back claims, Canadian British scientists publications support claims.  Insurance HEAVILY regulated industry. Like maybe single heavily regulated industry. Department Insurance said need charge X% unvaccinated status, Freedom Insurance would too, go business. need start treating unmasked/unvaxxed something like drunk drivers. Sure, drunk drivers get home okay. average, people drive drunk, people die road. deal this? Well, obviously can't catch drunk drivers, police arrest 1.5 million people drunk driving, something kills 10,000 people/year (about number die COVID-19 week). Masks suck  waiting vaccine one works incredibly well we’re told that’s good enough. ever good enough?

Again black white thinking here. First vaccine 100% protection secondly, 50% population vaccinated moment. Also, still know vaccines protect transmission, science still settled.

People sub live different reality it’s insane live see someone wearing mask, it’s almost guarantee they’re vaccinated. Non-vaccinated/non-maskers/don’t trust government-scientists-vaccine folks one here. That’s Delta much worse here.  1. true? There’s literally data this. majority people get severe symptoms ”long Covid”. 4,5 mil deaths globally this, considering spread infection, that’s lot. Also add lot deaths old and/or sick people you’ll realise it’s really dangerous average healthy person.

2. Sure, never reach 100% vaccination this, especially vaccines equally effective variants.

3. Source claim? hasn’t happened yet. Regardless, there’s proper authorisation vaccines yet take part trial period, especially don’t see need.  Exactly this-

Comparative risk thing. positive test reinfection?

Well no, one like numbers infections never got tested, people probably report reinfection.

Here's question natural immunity vs vaccine. One points made seems severe infection (that leaves hospital) vs mild infection, future immune response better/stronger defending covid (kind like exercised front-line troops mild infection). 

One point *didn't* make though majority people *don't* end hospital, I'm dubious people relying past infection immunity also good numbers reinfections. 

They also talk much wild card variants are. yet know well natural immunity helps them, good idea vaccines.

There's also data like [recent Yale 10% symptomatic breakthrough cases hospitalized, that's unvaccinated population. also seen stat various article says 97% hospitalized unvaccinated, obviously that's wrong direction causation.

Sorry I'm missing something everyone else seen... Going another rough fall winter... You’ve done anything do, even (never heard zinc thing), there’s nothing worried say anything Moderna Pfizer? pretty clear AZ's IP restrictions issue. specifically pointing Moderna/Pfizer prove point, AZ issue, else SII able manufacture sell vaccine $2.

You can't ways. know good ones older kids (12/13 years old)? MN's Governor Walz set self-imposed standard back beginning May. 70% vaccination rate July 1, whichever came first, mask mandate would lifted. 

**Literally one week later** announced mask mandate would lifted next day. following CDC's change guidance masks. much good respond changing guidance, MN's goal better one stick still fallback date. 

Since mid-May mask mandate lifted, MN little 200k people (not quite 4% state population) get first shot. kids 16 get vaccinated. whole idea incentivizing vaccinations removal masks...did functionally nothing. 

MN set exact goal gave it. Sounds almost like traditional flu symptoms. make flu season exciting. wonder many antiVa order McRibs? Wow discriminate older people can't get good look *all* wrinkles? hat sunglasses mask, could hitting granny!

I say older lady . . . people want know. Fully vaccinated American also enjoying carefree summer thanks Long Covid. looking forward potentially people dealing types health issues. Yeah, pretty good mentally fully vaccinated uptick breakthrough cases happening...I back feeling terrible everything. top off, one true crime friends died COVID! Ugh! mean I've read 6-month followup studies they've since even last year report significant % hospitalized survivors sequelae impairs lives multitude ways. One draw conclusions many sequelae cause life threatening/shortening events possibly far earlier would without stricken Covid first place. Here's one could mean literal Bay Area say this?  New Zealand tiny island like Samoa Tonga. population South Carolina Ireland physically size California. also open border Australia like state country 28 million. 

Also attacking lockdown Australia, also island able easily close borders. can't really argue lockdowns work NZ, cannot work Australia. Especially Australia successfully used lockdowns several times. probably get vaccinated risk Covid ending careers. understanding, issue willingness get vaccinated problem entirely Australian government buying vaccines. think Australia Europe January May people high risk could get vaccinated. 99% people turn zombies don’t eat brains, afraid becoming zombies?? Right? vaccinated, asymptotic person likely know it, they're probably shedding less unvaxxed people would, too. Asymptotic infections group likely undercounted.

Vaccines cures. They're literally mechanism body prepared possible infections cause little harm. Maybe look asymptotic cases ground floor efficacy, let's say even 100% vaccinated people never show symptoms, thing still floats around lands us time. realize that's IRL, even science constantly narrowing perfect measures, still mix combination means obtain medicine and/or willingness take it. many variables moment know covid continue, let alone arc past future plagues, mention miscellaneous health issues. never-ending battle us disease ebb flow. We've responded many illnesses mass effort. lethal require strong measures, one great success story eradication smallpox. ""common cold"" (another coronavirus) usually requires rest liquids (painkillers optional). vaccines counter-measures developed employed, we're going arrive expression peoples' choices whatever balance risk we're willing accept (shrug emoji).  get vaccinated. free. Even them. different Covid protocols per new CBA agreement signed last month vaccinated non-vaccinated individuals still restrictions. either violates restrictions subject 14K fine. unvaccinated individuals

Biggest restriction vaccinated individuals interact non-vaccinated individuals. 

Basic list restrictions below.

Everyone reporting trying make look like fine non-vaccinated individuals NFL level. wrong. bruce arians may talking bucs fining specifically unvaccinated players, thats article saying. Theyre claiming NFL level. misleading say least.  NYC completely back normal first week June do. IMO healthcare typically cost money, people use living without going extra skeptical sudden government offering something free.  fine them, let stadium. much yes. think can't see hear mask sunglasses hat earbuds whatever. Masks 4evah. Much simpler - void medical insurance life insurance coverage anyone needs hospitalization dies, vaccinated. maybe tied stimulus checks vaccination status somehow. Sure, that’s wearing mask. Exactly. great point! Agreed study big flaws would nice separate whole food plant based junk food vegan mostly whole food plant based eats animals.

Not perfect study means.

And also possibility adjusting variables. Controlling weight prime example.

Animal products calorie dense compared plant protein. 900-1100 calories per pound meat milk compared 500-700 calories per pound beans starches. make main portions animals you’ll probably eating calories people eat mostly unprocessed plants.

So control weight you’ll controlling since animal based diets tend include calories. processed foods processed oils calorie dense, thus it’d helpful sort further.

Same true diabetes. Eating chicken twice meat associated higher diabetes rates Nurses Health Study. control diabetes could incomplete picture.

Same true controlling blood pressure looking salt intake mortality. ways obscure effect controlling moderators.

If animal products increased calories higher BMI worse covid outcomes. controlling BMI would break chain obscure results. 

Agreed study isn’t perfect, I’d like see detail foods consumed too!

Notable keto diet worst also quite predictable. saying vaccinated got paid? 100 county would practically victory us, followed parade, round 14 started spreading expected virus though? thing happen colds flu every year? people seem think would exception variants This. vaccine=no play work still allow limited WFH - caring anyone work hours. many parents trying choose telling work hoping get caught homeschooling sending kid(s) unsafe schools. Even worse ones kids different school buildings bring various exposures home them.   would surprised AZ technically open everyone still need find right place get keen. CDC dumbass. CDC giving accurate medical information. risk getting getting sick vaccinated low mask necessary. something safe mean 0 risk. I'm sure feel vaccines safe. mean 0 risk. something 100% risk free mean deceitful say safe. 

They relay actual information finding. Insinuating giving false information due expected lack compliance exactly kind covid/vaccine conspiracy anti vaxxers want happen. GPs flat-out refuse tell wait Pfizer bit hit miss there, hopefully change ATAGI advice change heart NSW outbreak showing signs relenting. Friendly reminder: According U.S. Department Education, 54% U.S. adults 16-74 years old - 130 million people - lack proficiency literacy, reading equivalent sixth-grade level. 
There truly education crisis America. I've said since start vaccinations either going everyone masks refusing get vaccine going mask-less anyway. put vaccine passport system. got mine around may national guard still helping out. technically eligible, county getting low numbers telling people surrounding counties come in. Drove 3 hours way, shots. Can't tell many times thanked person interacted there. I'm sorry received much hate job trying save people's lives. considerable number 40s Australia willing get AZ jump hoops it. google ""australia 40 astrazeneca"" read news stories taken AZ despite 40. Sarah Moran's story stood (36 year old begging vax hub needs IVF expand business internationally). Since everyone keeps talking vaccines personal choice, I'm letting people make informed decision take it. allergies bad year times I've woken wondered I'm sick, would remind congestion side effect. That's really interesting. says report symptom improvement report symptom worsening. wonder there's mental aspect symptoms. Like placebo effect here. Unfortunately doubt ethically blind test. hard data would still interesting. open everyone. Wow. much milder would anti-mask sentiment never recommended masks early 2020?

That obvious lie, too. started wearing P100 industrial respirator despite this, one first cities get hit. next thing know turns COVID enter eyes well. still under-cautious!

I really disagree lying public ""for greater good."" lose credibility authority figure, people believe anyone tells want hear. whole state GOP vaccines, face masks even taking virus seriously. 

Now shit hit fan suddenly pro vaccine protective measures Trumps fault. real leader. Oh shoot thought may 2020. I’m sorry, &amp; thank efforts.  Yep, it, hell NO, go in. damn, Christmas decorating shouldn’t start July. Kids make growing share represent largest share unvaccinated.  
I believe schools probably masks many cases let’s use statistical manipulation prove point countries enough supplies vaccines. literally stressed 4 month old. anyone know fast 6 mo 11 YO shot ready? I'm praying soon. lot incompetent fools. Constant contraditing directives different govt orgs. public health official, whole job communicating shit effectively. Saying players fined wearing mask regardless vaccination status wrong. Vaccinated unvaccinated players different COVID protocols year, including mask requirement. per league wide announcement May.

Arians specifically referring unvaccinated players need make months 4 month old becomes old enough 6-11 yo shot clears trials. I'm praying happens end 2021. PRAYING.  Even proof vaccination, doubt highly unvaccinated denied services kind. be.
Like going large indoor event, boarding flight, rather proof vaccination, taking one rapid covid19 tests implemented.
Is reasonable option.
If cannot vaccinate whatever reason, medical reason, prepared jump hoops. Fair enough pandemic.
Like taking instant covid19 test. large, fast accurate.
Blanket discrimination cannot vaccinate simply unwilling answer. 
Not everyone get vaccines anti-vaxxers.
I cannot vaccinated due medical condition. I'm simply unwilling.
I've never issue wearing mask, temp checks even taking rapid covid19 test. I've done many times already. is.
I part must.
Is really fair deny privilege attending concert enjoy movie theatre again, condition?
Wouldn't unfairly discriminatory ?
We still keep safe without needing covid19 passport demanding. whole lot Americans carefree spring 2020. 

And summer. 

And fall.

And winter, spring, summer again.

This Covid measures creeping back lives. involves blatant lies social media, I'd say yes. crystal clear ""blatant lie"" defined, leave room manipulation... This!!!!! problem anti vaxxers. can't tell many people know refusing get issues vaccines (mandated not) point. think generalizing hesitancy issue anti vaccine causing disconnect.

Interesting angle. demographic probably fairly right times wrong considering demo likely working. Wonder they’ll share numbers afterwards. Also wonder there’s food-related incentive. lastly wonder corporate feels considering likely franchise operator. second point: addition earbuds sunglasses, masks added another barrier random dudes public might think want interact them, love it. Masks day every day me. Security theater! I've tempted start arguing anyone refuses vaccine actively suicidal. Nothing else really makes sense, talking highly infectious lethal virus. feel need vaccine kid go life, OK coming soon hope gotta til then. That's choice. rest world lives live, leave us please. Vaccinated going without mask putting kid significantly greater risk. Agreed, context including people vaccinated, I'm saying unfortunate likely robust protection Covid comes cost possibly irreversible damages, that's all. Good question life expectancy probably chip trade.

Ohh?

I know long haul stuff, concrete information this? *Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh* started showing symptoms Monday night, mine started Wednesday night. Still sure caught time gave me. vaccinated mind wearing mask. mind getting vaccine better fucking shutdown again!! job force people something will?  Lots blood hands. tiny hands  assuming survivors see getting Covid life expectancy trade. Vaccines available study began Sadly Delta variants. 

Doesn't mean much now.

""More 800 children Indonesia age 18 died virus since pandemic began, Dr. Aman said, majority deaths occurred past month."" August next week wearing chemical protective goggles first year, stopped cases dropped. steam terribly. tried face shield. covid October got moderna two shot vaccine completed February---doubt need booster Talking centered larynx think still learn talk without jaw.

Also interestingly enough may able reconstruct jaw taking pieces fibula!  CDC guidelines  It’s difficult help people just… don’t want helped. take wins get chief. per infraction…10x would $140K…that adds FAST relative vaccine, mask likely doesn’t much. Also masks aren’t problem, issue lockdowns come back.  Covid patients already infected, would glasses help point?

Edit: I’m dumdum. You’re suggesting there’s correlation nurses taking note wore got vaccine today notice pink color syringe. unexpected 
but figured maybe loop trusted pharmacist came home took nap. woke searching answer. 

CDC website says pfizer white opaque white. I'm worried.

I called CDC phone number questions. rep say vaccinated, confirm color placing hold twice.

I called local hospital, woman transfered said pink. also suggest imagined taken it. really bothering now. normal? color yours? ...huh yeah guess you’re right doubt it. anything want Biden fail blame him.

I think motivation, realized mostly Republican voters dying now. could effect heavily gerrymandered areas. point keep making vaccinated people keep saying pandemic 'OVER"" ""live fear"" ""enjoy social gatherings."" 

Like yeah, great, vaccinated good job, unless put mask back we're getting this. last outbreak Israel started unvaccinated children. Moved vaccinated adults spread unvaccinated adults. 

Yeah - vaccines great - (most likely) die end ICU - \*can\* spread vaccination protect Long Covid. 

Put masks people. talking AZ? Probably people sure they're supposed get not. onus government reach people better, get alternative vaccines  entirely dependent whether hospitalizations deaths get severe enough warrant it. Unless edge-case scenario vaccine-defiant breakthrough strain occurs, equally deadly contagious first, circumstances warrant lockdowns re-masking, least areas already high uptake vaccine. okay admit wrong sometimes.  sure thinking Austria? shit  That's would everything divide us make us distrust institutions.

He even went far take vaccine secret, GOP politicians conservative ""reporters"". India definitely following restrictions Delta variant exploded.

I agree, doesn’t exists exact school exact students. Also today:  They’re monsters, learn things watching ignoring say. ultra rich aren’t taking chances going Vegas, neither you.

That’s I’m worried about. health PRECIOUS me, concerts restaurants. Trying strike healthy balance right know many breakthrough cases laying healthy people up, make concerts indoor restaurants “worth it”. political, wanted reopen 4th July. frankly March looked like reach 70% end June. problem people waiting vaccine got earlier, open everyone lefty hesitant ones. right California example 70% predicted end June predicted end December probably move further.

At point want use vaccine get back normal need make normal vaccinated people (actually check vaccination, proof already covid negative test), leave things reopen stress healthcare system. Otherwise state long time (and vaccines stop working back square 1).

BTW: I'm wondering countries would import Chinese vaccine inactivated coronavirus, would people complaining mRNA untested would take it? government inept public half braindead. trouble. Really, pandemic small inconvenience get vaccinated wear mask others. Got J&amp;J myself, back April.

1) MAY need booster future. I've heard possibility hand without looking it. still TBD. need get it, will. yet.

2) sure international travel based country, fine United States unaccepted anywhere.

3) sure overloading killing thing, would get tested anyway wrote. went, ask health screening COVID within past 14 days whatever think they'll give that's case.  know masks help much keep distance That’s pretty messed thing say think it’s supply chain management that’s problem. spreads fast, I'm Thailand doubling nearly every week now. 10k cases day new high today 20k cases Covid19. Oh I've heard general flu, kids. hearing things kids. Severe flu joke whole family gets flu shot every year. couple long hauler children one whose asymptomatic infection may left permanent lung damage behind, think assuming kids 12 somehow immune impacts older humans good call. want setup generation say heart failure issues manage. 

And honestly, kids sacrificed last 18m help save lives adults, would nice adults country could keep piece cloth face till could also get protected. sites schedule empty!!! I’m sure get appt issue willingness get vaccinated problem entirely Australian government buying vaccine

This lie,

Prety much anyone get vaccinated Australia, unloess 16...(so far). lot vaccination centres throw vaccines dumb people wont get vaccinated. pay McHeartAttack using pre-tax medical joke funds I'm there? Respectfully, got Pfizer first tyke didn’t put inactivated virus body. past that? Health workers enough n95s, ones wear one chose to.

And clearer ""follow science"" like mask mandates. N95 flatly safety minimum, full stop. thought science said vaccinated spread virus (which questioned), give rat's ass unvaccinated unmasking too, care health workers n95 masks damned shortage.

This blindingly stupid, like clinics still ask China recently.  Probably not. DeSantis would sue. bit nuance data, appears 3-4 week interval 2nd shot maintain persistence high levels circulating antibodies blood well waiting longer shots.

So UK longer period shots showing higher effectiveness time.

And Isreal showing strong drop 4-6 months infection resistance. 

All studies currently show protection serious illness hospitalization maintained strongly vaccine long term.

So basically end exposed post vaccine fight maybe completely without symptoms short illness boost antibodies longer term.

Or higher risk people, might worth considering booster shots. “I’ve weight-cycled time think I’ve really got eating disorder locked in!” don’t antibodies

That's going reasonable amount time.

I'm going give benefit doubt say there's game telephone going on, meant there's much benefit titers start drop, could keep getting re-exposed. That's massive struggle whole time. even bring back mask mandates. federally anyway get call people ""selfish"" wanting live lives always have.

Correction then: get call people ""selfish"" wanting *everyone* live lives always have.

Thought implied, guess best clear. one openly shows data obviously. state anything want, it’s meaningless without proof form raw data full disclosure methods. French: oh fuck Respectfully need Google definition mean statistics Fair. Point either masks everyone vaccine passports. Regardless individual opinions, mine yours, proof vaccination highly contentious topic incur specific pushback. 

Not advocating mask mandate, pointing practical truth matter. I'm vaccinated going back 2 months ago seems painful. Zooming out, it'll forever debate libertarianism govt overreach. wonder times we're letting ideologies get way practicality. responding get call people ""selfish"" wanting live lives always have.

It sounds like saying can't say individual people selfish wanting live lives want themselves, others damned, individual people saying best see since framed liking, clearly selfish.

It's got nothing liking. strong view either side practical standpoint. think said makes much sense, least way said it. /s worst!
I able find masks nose guards librarian-with-glasses-down-their-nose look outside. 

This winter I’m masking I’m really glad found those. Plus face warm I’m standing outside 4 hours watching light show every night. wandering around building bored shows. last months.

The entire Support team let go, managed mobile sites too. think 18-20 people things.

Yeah, remember telling someone proudly got 3 people today laughed face. quickly added used 1600 people day site, felt like defending existence mobile event.

I know I'm happy worked deal. 5 people would leave smile, least know 5 people would able protection, may speak family friends urge get shots. 44?!? event?! I'd fucking toasted home family! :D would made said walk vaccination clinic took massive nose dive vaccinators sitting around day arms put shots 

Yeah... that's what's left events nowadays. I've caught reading events.

-------------

I always reminded people public service US citizens putting harms way administer shots potentially contagious people. That... anything, really helped stop people laughing us; actually help. 

But there's many times say that.

And say, hate door door. I'm supportive functions, unless someone specifically requests us. know risks vaccine.

But wanted say, one people, thank organizing deal see site somewhere; show support. kinda get lot people even paying attention us anymore, keep getting number updates decimal/fractional ticks up. Return lock down? story every time people. people matter, sometimes people they're close to. can't *all* psychopaths, I'm sure struggle much empathize, least apply logic something happens people easily happen them. can't imagine would happen again. game blinks first, anti vaxers world economy governments. always going struggling get people take vaccine economy would always locked there's always going idiots. There's nothing That's really. rivers gates left, emotional ties team gone. team matters fantasy teams, although still draft chargers players...  Also got PCR test result today negative. paranoid sore throat reason. COVID beginning (not confirmed test though, suggested multiple doctors) got vaccinated. taking precautions prevent catching sore throat concerning. don’t doctor says probably won’t get even tried. Get vaccinated folks. people still think vaccines rushed. risky drug? Let swallow whole bottles it! Oddly enough plague thing . swept though Europe first time targeting older then, swept took younger. oddly seems common progression pandemic.  comparing two different medications treat two different viruses two different things? neither even reading comments top posts past week? It’s pretty clear many people want I.dont know shit effective delta. might get it. Admittedly gonna sick. However see shit really stopping 
There lot myths here. around people infected probably gonna get  Hows KN95? see tons people area carefree summer. Barely see masks despite local vaccination rate around 58%. Delta yet penetrate area much how. It’ll find plenty hosts shows up. Exactly. moron taken covid seriously power maybe moronic followers would done same. Vaccine uptake would also higher  data still severity. idea survivors variant. idea percentage people get long covid. first two articles clicked cited numbers low single digits entire hospital systems. third one makes reference young children. Two Questions:

1. reason get J&amp;J vaccine two options US? Before, sounded like less effective, sounds like maybe better since require booster?
2. J&amp;J good future restrictions? (travel, etc.) want find ""got wrong vaccine"" can't travel. 
3. danger getting shot sick covid? I've mild-medium sickness past week wondering need get tested. Someone told getting shot sick covid overload kill you. 

Thanks! true all

I'm lockdowns need want people vaccinated Maybe u found correlation covid full moon? Forcing students keep cameras won’t damn bit difference. Online learning terrible vast majority kids.   100% vaccine makes severe case.

It's rare, actually still hospitalized die. People still especially careful they're immunocompromised older. Several countries already looking boosters declining vaccine efficacy cohorts. study references immune response higher people severe forms disease; feel fairly obvious people I'm referencing.   Nah. Australia everything right given current situation. It’s intelligent pursue zero covid vaccinating whole population. 3 months I’m sure Australia near fully vaccinated time spread low covid kicked good. Except I’m saying lines actual numbers. know track stuff, right?  first movie rewatched lockdown started. (D)ifferent Same. neurotics sub keep living bubble wrap lives indefinitely  need constitutional amendment. anything close happens, United States country dead. Even China Vietnam resorting this. get personal experiences aren’t universal though, right? I’m telling what’s happening among NCOs, especially Marines, pretty unsurprising know them. numbers DoD itself:   It’s reason people fight universal healthcare, livable minimum wage, affordable education. hate thought helping anymore besides themselves. Nope. cant put toothpaste back tube. Sure, try mandate again, compliance lot lower everything opened up. time, anti-vaxers never masked continue refuse wear masks, vaccinated upset mask protect anti-vaxxers, say 'i part, fuck everyone else' also refuse mask up. 

To add that, several states already proactively banned mask requirements completely, even schools, knew something like might happen.

I guess see compliance LA St. Louis, seeing hearing, lucky even third compliance prior June 15th. Even Sheriff LA wont enforce it. mean week half. negative side effects long haul. Guarantee life expectancy unchanged Thanks brother. basically I've feeling like since got 30. Thanks doctor... good fitting black kn95 recommendations?  Thanks, appreciate update.

I'm finding little funny embarrassed would (here CA) pretend worker gotten vaccine yet. (I got J&amp;J.) right. variant breeding grounds. society filled morons going dealing pandemic like conditions years unless get extreme good luck. 

It’s sad advanced technology knowledge - entirely dependent luck bring pandemic end despite fact every tool disposal end pandemic entirely within month two. Whomever downvoting please need answers thats helpful. Vaccinated people still get sick too. I'd rather roll dice regardless many sides have.. Fit important. hard find make/model fits. know. looked like exactly might right place this, who've COVID, send friend who's currently got it? want send little care package. would appreciated recovering? 

(I'm interested vaccination discussions here. I'm fully vaxxed, talked months ago, they're still friend). vaccinated risk. Move wipe out.

I keep seeing people write sort thing covid death sentence covidiots die. medical care mortality around 0.5%. Nobody getting wiped out. going lots people get sick one 200 dying. 14k violating protocol could 14k help people poverty also keep people safe virus violating protocols. Reality know happen Delta. looking like double everything would still put kids low risk. 
My kids everything need, school imperative. mine meant less transmission families less resources, then, might make sense. 5-11 year olds get vaccinated months. never said schools need closed I'm sure getting that. Schools closing, add mitigation efforts things get worse fall. kids get vaccinated, unvaccinated 12 get infected spring, things might look whole lot like pre-covid days. Let's hope worst variant next much less transmissible damaging. part 0 27% part study, background info others done. 

The actual result 109 seropositive children (4%) vs 28 1246 seronegative ones (2%) reported least 1 symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks (see Table symptoms lasting beyond 4 12 weeks). frequently reported symptoms lasting 12 weeks among seropositive children tiredness (3/109, 3%), difficulty concentrating (2/109, 2%), increased need sleep (2/109, 2%). None seropositive children reported hospitalization October 2020. Similar proportions seropositive seronegative children reported excellent good health.

It's still big study, 4% previously infected children (seropositive) reported long-lasting symptoms vs 2% never-infected children (seronegative). symptoms included common stuff like tiredness difficulty concentrating, good study ""control group"" uninfected children. 4% significantly different 2%.

The earlier Italian study reported 27% control group. common long-lasting syndrome insomnia, may cultural confounding issues Italian kids generally set bedtimes go sleep parents do. 

The [0% study Australian 155 155 children back baseline health status upon follow-up 3-6 months later. Also, 171 children, 1 severe respiratory issues (had congenital heart disease) 2 MIS-C/Kawasaki; rest mild/asymptomatic. stated whether 3 serious cases part 155 (or missed it). knew would endemic start. virus mutated quickly already become endemic knew had. mutating everywbere. Americans time telling stupid arguing mask mandates lifted, telling didn’t lift, one would get vaccine since there’s point getting vaccine still wear mask?

Yet Ontario, Canada, we’ve vaccinated 80% population kept mask mandates US stuck 50-something percent. Living life normal now. restrictions me. Sorry. Half state water time new mortgages paid off. Read article. ""Findings several studies suggest SARS-CoV-2 transmission among students relatively rare, particularly *when prevention strategies place*."" go footnote find studies fall 2020. So, happening fall 2020?

1) Mask mandates, social distancing, distance learning options schools. 
2) DELTA variant.

Now GOP governors law makers outlawing mask mandates schools, CDC fatally slow changing idiotic new policy ""no masks vaccinated"" ""don't ask, tell"" unvaccinated. study track Delta useless study. game changed. Thanks. curious distinctions made.

Not questioning medics, vaccines, science. seems like docs must make difficult choices category. Might well make multi-variant booster it. I'd love see vaccination enforcement squads making use military gear I've buying local police station taxes.

Way better use silencing/intimidating peaceful blm protestors. hope vaccine passports become thing. Let’s treat covid spread like serious threat is. I'm sorry loss  gripe phrase problem “The doctors need spin doctors”. absolutely right. 

I completely understand new virus guidance expected change learn, need help framing information presenting messages. died causes COVID-19 positive. let em bitches die, nothing value lost 140% transmissible official. 60% alpha. It’s maddening enough Reddit trying bring fact long covid mysteries around mean need exercise precautionary principle still bring spread control - let things spread unchecked. say wrong thread downvotes oblivion.

So Fauci must frustrated, it’s frustrating anybody considers covid-19 dangerous threat days. goes ""alternative facts"" bullshit. Fact fact, opinion. 

You opinion vaccine work kill you, that's based fact. Ah yes dance floor Red Lobster Except CDC political body. Playing politics literally job.

In normal emergency caliber, CDC would issue guidance **and country would wait** policymakers (like pandemic taskforce created White House Congress) issue new policy. CDC relied upon policy, making it. provide science, cadre politicians policy wonks provide rules. Everywhere I've lived democrats working class, hyper conservatives rich fuck trailer trash pretty much nothing between.  Yeah got go back distancing Reddit quick point 400 children US died Covid, ignoring 74,000,000 robbed two (three?) years education social development. much taken entire generation never get back. I'm surprised emergency authorization kids, vaccine tested kids concurrently. Like, anyone one vaccines.

These archaic rules killing hundreds kids. believe average NFL career, actually make roster (there 100+ bodies training camp, gets cut 53 season starts actually make NFL money) 3.5 years. eight year career, rookie contract followed second contract, WAY beyond norm. 

These freak athletes very, small window make enough money current future insanely competitive rosters. them, even inkling idea vaccine could lead minute impact physical performance, see balking.

Some plain uneducated well, coasting high school years college thanks parties interested seeing field. suspect fair number high school even university degrees equivalent 7th 8th grade education. even literate. teeth policy, “if team miss game due Covid can’t reschedule, forfeit. extra weeks season make rescheduling easier. real teeth: game missed, **neither team’s players get paid week**. Meanwhile actually civilized part Missouri;

#*you idiots!* India high rate tuberculosis. addition smoking high 
I know good immune system helps auth compromised lungs good Anti-vaxxers dying ups average IQ it’s aite Arguably there's probability evolve vaccine longer effective. probability increases time.

The mRNA vaccine quickly adapted issue, need go FDA (and equivalent) approvals. course could skip steps get faster, would everyone mind it? mean right people refuse vaccinate call experiment. Invite antivaxxers visit ICU wards LA county. dying patients offer warm hug wet french kiss. Checks already vaccinated hope implied Nice soon say. think we'll clear picture week goes on. UK definitely seeing downturn i'd caution declaring victory delta yet. worst yet come. rate we're going we're jumps away perfect virus rampantly transmissable, highly damaging/lethal resistant current vaccines.

Far many letting evolutionary dice keep rolling even realize it. NYC crazy, like vast majority even log once. let alone work least chance, never saw dad took hospital oxygen. technological problem. Children (and people general) need real human contact learn grow.  CDC et need hire staff deal political campaigns. unfortunately necessary.

You read mind! I’ve saying since pandemic started; phrase “These doctors need spin doctors”, lol. 

It’s true, need help packaging information pill people swallow. pEoPlE cAnT ShOtS

Yes, some. small amount relative general population. 

If aren’t vaccinated yet mere choice, choices gravely life altering consequences.

There vaccine passports. It’s coming. So, movies, bars, restaurants, doctors offices, museums, shopping you.

Republicans didn’t want restrict sort economic activity, opposed lockdowns. justify that, said Covid nothing worry about, hospitalizations deaths nothing, it’d Easter, etc.. Lockdowns nothing must form control.

Once convinced voters Covid nothing, lockdowns real threat, it’s logical vaccine made response nothing importance, pushed aggressively lockdown proponents means form control.

That’s right responsible politicizing vaccines. doesn’t matter two hard left weirdos don’t want vaccinate, exceptions exist, right refuses vaccines discernible reasons past two years, directly result leaders pundits’ strategizing. Memory malleable yes. However,

People saying anti-maskers weren’t wearing masks even back don’t care mandated. People thought others ridiculous mad CDC insistent keeping masks, ridiculed following science “until science didn’t match wanted”. even several articles stating increase vaccinations mandate removed.

Now suddenly CDC apparently wrong remove mandate? turns yes, anti-maskers wearing masks mandate lifted? apparently anyone half brain could seen coming?

When quoting info Samara Tatarstan talking regional level. discussed Russian media regional governments lower numbers.

For instance, Northwest original Google translate display table end article (at least me).

Yes, Rosstat reports late (in June publish report April, July May etc), wait data civil register arrive (say, one born died 31th May certificate issued June event go May report), still correct past reports publishing new one sometimes data arrives late (although low number affect general Rosstat ""trustworthy"" Rosstat is

The article mainly talks statistics can't seen easily: income level, GDP etc. Deaths way noticeable, discrepancy COVID deaths excess mortality (see previous sources). article discrepancy absence causes death data Rosstat reported substantial increase non covid deaths, e.g. diabetes, age, community spread pnumonia, diseases nervous system.

Rosstat compiles reports based death certificates sent regional civil registers, going reexamine cause death listed there. Yes furiners  fair, Israel March looked like may reached end tunnel, delta definitely thrown sand gears.

Apparently successful! Eh, saw mix both. Mutations random. virus conscious, mutate randomly whichever one makes easier spread wins. could mutate something dangerous less dangerous. However ideal virus become dangerous kill host faster make harder spread. Delta symptoms indication, already seems like 'trying' mutate flu. this? spread more.

If natural antibodies catching covid die 8 months, like we've seen data suggesting, long-term health effects last longer necessarily need deadly. need catch 2-3 times dead. 

Imagine flu much damage catching 2-3 times, die accumulated issues, antibodies fade infections scars remain. That's one many reasons covid scares crap me. Last year vaccine available. could backfire, pass, lead hamstringing NFL protections actually able put place. first link published three days ago, second link says ""The recommended schedule two doses (30 µg, 0.3 ml each) given intramuscularly deltoid muscle. interval 21–28 days doses recommended.""A 21-day gap shots used trials recommendation. got first shot March second April. countries leaving bigger gaps doses supply issues, ""truckload"" evidence effective wait. delay second dose supply issues also discussed second link. $, always $ happens new administration wants create insert conservative agenda enforcement squad? cool team power? personally think elected offices power need.  logical standpoint, anyone trying ""slap back"" verifiably correct assertion vaccines work, even getting asymptomatic mild case worse vaccine still sign vaccine effective engaging bad faith arguments. They're using science, reason, logic argue this. ""Yeah know guy got COVID vaccine died, ergo vaccines suck!"" equivalent saying ""I know guy lottery, folks saying hard win?""

While early days pandemic showed ""it's flu bro"" minimalism flat wrong, fact vaccinate enough, actually *does* render virus much less effective basically becomes worse cold/flu level event. Maybe even less so.

The UK showing break ""link"" high case load unreasonably high death totals. Delta surge (which seems already fading there) never even close hospitalizations/deaths pre vaccination surges.

Anybody tests positive yet still goes recreationally charged assault. Hey check get vaccinated got ask doctor ? Fatal outcomes seem come 4-8 weeks infection, like 12-15 days average.

If compare gradient peaks infections curve versus deaths curve UK, find death rates lag 2 weeks most. fatalities linger on, seem happen rather promptly.

For example, winter outbreak, infections peaked January 8th, deaths peaked January 20th, 12 days later. first wave, reported infections peaked April 12th, deaths peaked April 21st, 9 days later.

Based that, UK continues current trajectory, deaths current wave peak somewhere 1st 5th August. No, help spreading keeping vaccination rate needed herd immunity. really wonder children start getting noticeably high rates response look like. point, we're going let Darwin work magic.

I really wish approve younger kids soon possible. saying UKs sample size larger Israel's?

Almost triple. children completely unprotected

But clearly protected, die rates significantly lower 20s/30s/etc. 

And can't compare flu exactly? every single child get flu shots? flu shots effective considering new variants come every year? 

You're going very, hard time convincing parents give 8 year old vaccine disease virtually chance ever killing them. Pneumonia killed 3x many kids, yet freak it.  right. actually successful lockdown US six weeks.

Yes lol Yeah comment shows idea Australian politics delete comment it’s quite frankly embarrassing anyone know. news articles like daily occurrence delta must running rampant unvaccinated people America Anti-vaxxers exists limited degree across groups, generally anti vaxxers hard right.

Here Sweden survey vaccine sentiment across political parties, less parties constant 2% anti vaxxers, moderate right hard left slightly higher 3-4%.

However, hard right 14% anti vaxxers. 17% vote total, anti vaxxers rest parties ""children dying""
You: ""Children getting covid""

Yes thank you, know kids get covid. sure cases relevant kids dying. 297 children beginning covid actually fantastic number. mention deaths vaccines out. locked million people, right move? People took advantage honor system cutting line get shot too. Roughly half population world live India China, countries always good bets. hear concern! Florida surging right now. passed laws banning vaccine mandates, probably means Disney can’t require vaccines employees. 

I think schools open second week August, going see another surge cases it’ll probably couple weeks that. I’d see looks end August whatever makes comfortable. masks prevents people getting covid? helps cases, sure. even close effective vaccine - also decreases odds dying get covid. ever really thought wasn’t going yearly thing?

And affect 'disadvantaged individuals limited access education'. fact, I've run plenty highly intelligent people advanced degrees , even areas like microbiology extremely hesitant loudly confirm ""I'll get vaccine I'm forced gunpoint"". distrust 'system' they'd rather let dangerous virus uncontrollably multiply cells - produce substances vaccine produces SO, afraid - take thoroughly tested medical product. 

Ergo, nothing 'logic' 'lack access accurate information', 100% anxiety emotional dysregulation. Indonesia story even estimate children's case fatality rate, mean alarming rate absolute numbers - everyone getting sick country young population weak healthcare system, many children end dying. UK, 2 per million infected children died, obviously rate much higher Indonesia. assume? Similar.

Delta kind crazy well, showing 1000% higher viral load. Israel finding vaccines waning infection prevention months go on, prevention severe symptoms still remains much higher. Bottom line, unfortunately going many thousands child deaths end year, best. could also make worse. people ignoring sniffles assuming cold going daily life whilst covid. sorry. sorry poor woman family. reason need vaccine: don’t spread someone vulnerable. “When political pot boils, scum rise; hope shall influenced interest &amp; feelings moment—but permanent prosperity country.”

I honestly expected daily new cases surge six figures we'd hit peak. trend continues incredibly good thing. also means fourth lockdown September looking increasingly unlikely. Netherlands skyrocketed night clubs opened. Specifically, opened people who:

- received final vaccine shot day went night clubs (no period vaccine work, typically 2 weeks)
- gotten rapid test 40(!) hours event
- Falsified vaccine/test certificate showing someone else’s (and check clubs whether certificate legitimate)
- allowed enter regardless certificate clubs visitors = $$$ edit disclaimer still fails admit vaccination helps immensely providing preemptive protection. Less vulnerable people means less opportunity mutations. Well fair took billions organisms deaths make world live in. Existence death life. Life like crust earth compared total mass.

So, natural immunity due acquired immune system. would get vaccine natural immunity? Seems likely time, specific news.

Have look bottom post linked bottom *this* post. NYT article likelihood boosters. That’s pretty much family. daughter 3 congenital condition increases risk respiratory illness. keeping activities outdoors, pool park mostly. It’s looking like vaccines younger kids come along mid-winter, we’re minimize risk then. She’s signed preschool lot outside time, we’ll see transmission area looks like preschool requires staff vaccinated. wait watch.  What's name documentary? appropriate time say ""No shit?"" Yes want permanent lock down. want lock levels traffic. settle temporary.   well DeSantis stops sharing data like India. Delta spreads quickly, result number uninfected people infect also diminishes rapidly. also add number vaccinated people CDC actively discussing recommending vaccinated Americans wear masks public. good, CDC for, makes sense always reassessing situation.

However, looking data coming UK Netherlands, trajectory epi curve timing reopening, active discussions result choosing wait least 10-14 days changing anything. really want avoid scenario which:

1. recommend vaccinated Americans wear masks public;
2. Southern states ignore it;
3. Headlines start popping criticizing states (2) predicting doom;
4. epi curve states starts showing pattern we're seeing UK, cases start dropping right ignored new CDC recommendation.

Whether like not, scenario would make future mask recommendations, probably urgent winter, less likely successful. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Legally, things might need change, also need consider public perception - speed testing seems hard boundary lot people, comes overcoming vaccine hesitancy. that's exactly it. I'm going force get vaccine. I'm going say going anywhere without it. 

Can work remote, order Instacart, stay home next couple years? yes? Okay. get stay fuck home. Wanna literally anything? Get vaccine. rough estimation 20-30% UK population covid point, possibly even higher.

So use 20% X 25 million estimated number infected children (for conservative number). One doctor somewhere noted similarity somewhere spike protein iirc something placental protein. There's one bit evidence immune response spike protein would actually target placental protein, they're similar enough expect happen, problems fertility pregnancy. social media posts vaccine harming fertility still went viral, people believed them. everyone making reasons going now, stop. Let's admit really understand things happen, can't predict surges grow subsid, recognize lack control things. Surges come go like seasons, we're honest, know citation needed long term symptoms / rates vs viruses. moderate severe symptoms get covid healthy. FIFY Rolling loud awful idea see posts shit everywhere still feel responsibility minimize spread much possible children vaccinated.

And I'll wear mask wherever *required* so.

That aside, agree. Unvaccinated adults problem. everything supposed past ~18 months fucks give. Yup. NY actually higher rate vaccinations compared UK Delta FIRST started surging UK, shouldn’t see substantial deaths hospitalizations. Ya, estimates roughly 950k dead. I'm really, really sorry loss.  What's surprising model England Scotland, got Delta early (2-3 weeks ahead rest UK). Scotland peaked 4,000 cases day 3 weeks ago, translates around 50,000 peak UK infections. Excel could worked cells. Yep. Given viral infection potential trigger chronic post-viral illness, I'd imagine mild breakthrough cases still potential, definitely interesting see vaccination reduces astonishingly high 25-33% chance persistent symptoms previously reported. Oh, 100%. got vaccinated first day released age group, 2nd shot definitely threw immune system overdrive. So, clearly there's magic immunity blood something, noticeable situation lot common one would think.  Better safe sorry definitely agree points made. vaccine would suggest take wish US would acutally put faith vaccines well. time every (most) government officials advocating everyone ge vaccines, one get back country unless PCR test recovered Covid within 60 days. Vaccination proof accepted. Can’t. ACA. Sky high insurance premiums go even using covid excuse. (Insurance companies already larger profits covid.) Exactly. preclinical research give us good idea effective cases. Besides which, design would probably need tweaked real-world virus. They're bunch cowards. cousin NYC teacher covid earlier year spreads vaccine misinformation like wildfire. can't wait hear whine this, sure hell quit job. blessing curse  think deserve downvotes, again, saying we're ""beginning"" pandemic could fairly described scaremongering. That's thing could come with. I’m boat. There’s lot hopium smoked right now. least positive news stories trickling out. I’m certainly wait see camp. There’s lot could happen next couple months either direction. appreciate negative impacts killing people, sending hospital, put active effort save them? Also go infect people? impact things ability kill, fundamentally disrupt lives livelihoods. 

Additionally, like things, preventative measures valuable reactionary comes health care - take Delta variant - much frustrating strain, found room mutate largely unvaccinated community. vaccinate, protect *deal* potentially deadly strain future.

Also, less discussion free speech structure platform. issue social media freedom speech, way favors certain voices. platform drowns reasonable stances amplifying propaganda overall detrimental free speech. Yep. people know vaccinated going restaurants worst surge last winter anyway. listen guidance then, they're going listen guidance now. Thalidomide vaccine. Drugs take regularly vaccine body matter weeks. Everything open back normal, inevitable. Even vaxxed state Vermont 67% vaccinated, 33% population vulnerable living pre-pandemic life super contagious strain, small rise too. OP, close friend long-term European boyfriend. either faces choice 1) living full time Europe (away family friends) 2) going permanently long distance. choose first.

They desperately hoping could travel US early fall could finally introduce family, but....looking like can't happen.

They're vaccinated.  It’ll take least another week whatever effect reopening cases felt. I’m encouraged I’ll celebrate ends continuing go down, I’m waiting now. link says something different you’ve saying thread. live pretty well vaccinated area yet we’re seeing cases positivity rates rising pretty fast. sure why. It’s pretty frustrating. Reposting comment coronavirus uk thread topic: unable visit marry American fiancée 18 months intensely stupid policy. ruined lives (along equally stupid UK visa rules). Delta rampant throughout country allowing unfettered domestic travel, Americans come go around world please, I, fully vaccinated UK citizen, would happy test, quarantine, give proof vaccination, somehow threat? also continue single UK Schengen zones bans, despite fact much pandemic relatively safe/heavily vaccinated, allowing travel parts world virus uncontrolled.

There absolutely nothing rational it. seriously thought international travel big issue, would impose restrictions Americans go make quarantine, like here. political capital that, take meaningless stance appear ""tough COVID"". I'm aware seriously affects small number people, made life hell us. irrational there's way knowing finally take ban lifted, we're stuck limbo. maddening. Also mentioned sub, Portugal also seeing decrease number cases (although reach heights UK had).  social distancing measures necessary though? Hospitals aren’t overwhelmed cases quickly peaked headed down. Hard say restrictions “necessary” boat you. See recent posts. PM like talk someone understands going through. they’re not.

Yes, are. mask mandate didn’t happen vacuum it’s hysterics.

[20% L.A.’s cases right County weekly breakthrough cases: we’re alone:

[42% Cambridge, MA’s cases 20% Lexington, KY’s cases vaccines work, everyone get them, let’s deny breakthroughs happen contribute spread. Saying L.A. hysterical counterproductive. L.A. suburb 53% vaccinated. i've told people ignoring masks, social distancing, getting vaccinated, etc like drinking driving. want property, sure, fine. closed course, odds hurting someone else slim. want rest society, able charge crime that. FDA need give vaccines full approval. That's last hurdle making mandatory. hold up? point know completely safe, right? like Skittle analogy. would also unlucky one gets bad Skittle. Walmart giving vaccine. whenever buying food. ....duh? yes. lol “mild” cases probably hard track considering symptoms could something else, cold, allergies, congestion, whatever else.

A stuffy nose small coughing fit isn’t exactly lining people nearest testing site. doesn’t say masks though. connected thing. populace average higher education even individuals don’t within population tend refined common sense. social animals learn valuable perspectives around us. vaccinated COVID-19, care start experts say. fundamentally different. Again, see connection here. There's nothing vaccine anything fertility. Even example thalidomide, caused birth defects, affect fertility. 

It seems like people grasping straws here. like saying electric cars impact fertility. There's literally connection. Yes, many people mentioned that, right. Accounting age, health issues change chance dying. young people still die. fuck ton, millions long haul covid, possibly permanent damage. still virus everyone want get. Would eat skittle jar 500 million bucks? 1 skittle laced cyanide? wouldn't. I'm unlucky. I'd definitely wind eating bad one. could depend many cases found routine tests school extent parents stopped testing kids school finished. think attempt reference perception illegitimacy correct COVID vaccine 'I regret letting hungry leopards eat face' weird way spelling 1% 10% population 6.5million. dumb everyone vaccinated. Teacher phenomenal coworkers vaccinated soon eligible. agree necessary measure get city workers vaccinated, paint us broad brush? nightmare year teachers too.  LA unvaccinated people 3000 sq miles Alabama entire state want toddler safe. mentally emotionally exhausting trying keep exposed. amount vaccines play matter. choice either ""front loading"" aiming rapid single dosses aiming fully vacinated people. face decision whether 4 vacines 4 million places chose front load seem made right call.  can’t believe America fucked badly, we’re still fucking delta. CDC said masks vaccinated, opened flood gates. CDC royally fucked messaging. Good fucking luck rescinding guidance getting people follow it. Look herd immunity works make look like bigger idiot. really sucks compliance less new mandate CDC dropped guidelines. Prior new guidance, almost everyone still masked neighborhood (northeast San Fernando Valley, got hit really hard winter). weekend new mandate 40% masks chin straps grocery store. really think CDC blew one knew Delta coming. Masking definitely thing lockdown, segments population (particularly sub) want masking required well it’s necessary. prefer UV light butt disinfect body inside out.  vaccines still work variants. Instead looking number cases, better look hospitalizations deaths, they're still low places lot people vaccinated, like UK.

A vaccine force field completely stop viruses. inhale viruses, going body, body probably deal quickly nothing serious happens.  Tell Floridians, I'm still season numbers better 2019 numbers. shit never going away here.  end BS travel restrictions, move vaccine passports? worried young, pushing faster approval vaccine them.

The FDA seem especially worried given rushing approval. think they'd starting points fine tune roll quickly, something adminster advance need.

Think difference starting trials initially hit areas January 2020 could made. someone natural immunity? Here’s statement this: immunity may offer better protection mRNA vaccine response. don’t know yet. place go you’re unvaccinated, fuck yourself*.

*unless you’re immunocompromised case I’m sorry you’re position due ignorant asshats.  talking sources talking mans capacity learn. Sources change throughout time. people alway lack capacity see beyond bullshit.  Safe begin me! 😒 use universal skull crossbones poison sign non reading antivaxxers. Yes, I'm aware probabilities work. I'm aware vaccines failing provide immunity, goal every successful vaccine history point broadly achieved. I'm aware surging cases even highly-vaccinated countries UK. I'm aware drug companies sold vaccines seeking claim success despite obvious failing. I'm aware may look sell us another one. I'm also aware might buy it. I'm aware last comment said true, one cannot avoid passing Covid except staying full isolation. I'm disappointed. Sureeee did. bet know better CDC right?

I can't imagine arrogance takes look vaccine card CDC'S logo stamped right go ""pff know"" I'm pretty sure experts saying vaccinated. Telling unvaccinated people go anywhere another argument. Risk loosing insurance coverage good incentive though I’m talking vaccine deniers talking humans. Vaccine deniers dig grave much change that. don’t know son can’t get vaccinated yet chronic asthma. ask someone else question. makes sense Great warning us trying avoid plague rats  unvaccinated people (troublingly, unvaccinated older people) UK Netherlands, also saw RAPID high spikes cases Delta. But, Delta waves shorter duration past waves crashing back quickly well. Meanwhile hospitalizations levels lower past waves, deaths MUCH, MUCH lower past waves. So, examples give us reason optimism. sorry loss. It’s heart breaking see people life saving. opportunity lost loved ones didn’t have. I’m debating mask mandates. I’m saying I’ve never read anyone calling lockdowns. ridiculous. /s

Wait, sarcasm? get it. literally follow expert advice. Restaurants coffee shops low profit margin, there's way they'd afford Bruh... there's hospital hour away steady stream patients dying COVID denying literal dying breaths. People underemployed unemployed pay low (or no) taxes. Tax credits mean nothing them.

Then make refundable credit like Earned Income Tax Credit, benefits low/no income people. welcome news. Thanks! That’s true. Cases look like might starting level Greene County said, cases started rising early June, might actually 4-6 weeks ahead parts country.

I’m really trying make predictions myself. don’t think Gottlieb especially sound basis his. many variants there, cases around going like crazy, vaccinations barely moving, I'm feeling optimistic coming months all. I've come expect roller coaster ride. Oh ok. Yeah joined trials booster study problem vaccines. logical explanation I’m letting personal fatigue pandemic skew sense reasoning? pay taxes can't participate society?  Guessing strains target given year indeed lot problem Gottlieb getting feeling peak outbreak US 2-3 weeks away UK trends mind.  again. Precisely.

I’m scientist. absolutely zero empathy anyone chooses get vaccinated sheer ignorance stubbornness.

I literally could care less anti vaxxers. They’re danger world. Maybe way infect other? truly hope correct. look exponential curve Delta, growing much faster previous variants grew winter, fear analysis missing something. Maybe Alpha infections provide good protection Delta? thing know certain this: America people seem dead set non-pharmaceutical interventions. 30% us refuse vaccine eternity. we're find right not. pray are. IFR COVID 0.5-1%, according World Health Organization. 50% US fully vaccinated. 100% remaining unvaccinated people remain unvaccinated, got COVID, 1% die (0.5% total population, upper bound IFR), would bump vaccination rate 50% 50.25%.

In words, maximum amount ""anti-vaxxers"" died getting COVID experienced upper bound fatality rate, would bring vaccination rate 50.25%, 80%.

Additionally, unvaccinated disproportionately young, practice IFR would much lower 1%, IFR arrived including elderly, overwhelmingly vaccinated. practice, effect would even negligible. maybe I’ll inject bleach get home! don’t really need pills…. /s proof? insurance company business model want people live longer premiums chance grow larger payout. kind local death disaster screws that's there's another level (global reinsurance) spread risk countries. everyone's dying/being disabled worldwide time they'll go bankrupt fast. may necessary, definitely raises anxiety level regarding faster timetable Moderna, may able meet F.D.A.’s expectations bigger trial size still file request expand emergency authorization vaccine end September. Reviewing safety efficacy data likely take regulators least weeks.  previously said expects results 5-to-11-year old group September, results children aged two five shortly after. Results youngest children ages six months two years old expected October November. spokeswoman said Monday company updates timetable.

Hopefully major impact... Getting tested today, getting vaccinated family tomorrow. reason getting tested whole weekend horrible case stuffy nose, ears aghhhh. Sinusitis proven otherwise. fever, nothing else happened yet far. family members ok normal.  10% population quite lot people. schmuck senator start accusing something stupid, wait see almost like people get vaccinated worth eroding public trust vaccines! vaccinated people still getting infected generally mild symptoms, essentially mean there's less pressure virus evolve become less deadly, since significant vaccinated population means there's going regular reserve virus circulating killing off?

Isn't like double-whammy unvaccinated population, especially many vaccinated people basically adamant taking kind precautions spread?

Yikes. guess would levelled slightly dropped Euros alone enough keep they're over, normal service resumed puts us back track military trucks take coffins away :( Add State California's public employees list. Oklahoma something similar years ago smoking. restaurants non-smoking unless restaurant separate area ventilation system. 

The vast majority restaurants went non-smoking. know one put smoking section, interstate cater truckers travelers. No, no, no. Goofy's ""Ya ha hoo hooey"" much appropriate here. Nobody complains TV works. complain work. Good, big duh. Counter headline -- Vaccine strikingly effective wake Delta even asymptomatic transmission.

5,700,000 residents. 

4,275,000 vaccinated 1,425,000 unvaccinated/partial.

484 fully vaccinated diagnosed 612 unvaccinated/partial. \*(Note, headline includes partially vaccinated people vaccinated. considering partial vaccinated UNVACCINATED)

&amp;#x200B;

484/4,275,000 = .00011321 

612/1,425,000 = .00042947 

&amp;#x200B;

(.00042947 - .00011321) / .00042947 = 73.63% 

&amp;#x200B;

In words, vaccine 73.63% effective reducing infection (Singapore seems tracking symptomatic asymptomatic). Yeah, 600+k dead americans, worth wear mask subway. freaking hate US point totally bullshit travel ban. administration great letdown   Riiiiiggggghhht. 

That’s even correct survival rate, good try. like 98.2 looking deaths/cases US. It’s like 8-10 times deadlier flu typically is, vaccine that. Reverse psychology? Oppositional Defiant Disorder? Aunt nurse practitioner antivaxx (though won’t straight admit it). Nearly entire clinic got shut one employees tested positive. Aunt 1-year old son forced quarantine. Great job putting new family jeopardy refuse vaccinate.

So I’m definitely board this. Nurse Aunt FORCED vaccinated wants keep job, Nephew’s sake least. Nope, oath doctors take whereby need sacrifice well-being others. doctors want overworked underpaid, that's fair game healthcare system compensate public acted irresponsibly.

Knowing fully well healthcare systems become overburdened actions. care healthcare workers disproportionately shoulder burden? Nope, makes far selfish done enjoyment rather make doctors smart noble thing.

Who said covering ass don’t thick skin necessary job.

Did read article? unlikely, live Florida haha ""freedom"" crowd problem getting groped TSA, dicked around health insurance, listening bosses. make law books, get indignant people, shut go along Maybe offered free pizza every shot US Yeah, works ways countries worried numerator. US denominator too. would truly hate see cowards react pandemic higher caliber hits world. Maybe straight shit pants fear? Maybe crawl janitorial closet weep scrubs? mass testing protocols mean test exposed anyone positive. anything else think we'd find somewhat similar results did. agree points. places running PCRs Ct 35 - 40 (mostly 40), CDC changed Ct recommendation vaccinated 28. Ct 40 8000x sensitive 28. Fauci even said anything 32 going active infection. I've seen Kary Mullis discussing PCR tests (and Fauci) intended used using them. Maybe -- maybe justifiable actually working contact tracing never country (US). even scenario they'd really need provide Ct useful. helpful tracking epidemic positive hits getting months old. Delta spreads easily, herd immunity might really achievable without mass total vaccinations. I've vaccinated. I’m everyone that’s personal health risk assessment.

The thing is, people tend absolutely awful estimating probability risk...  I'd say no. NY 70% vaccination rate, US whole 45-50% - thats huge difference. NY still rising. may exactly referring to.

"" know think ""  joke, know that's *exactly* conclusion conspiracy crowd going jump  It’s sad, it’s right decision “Majority *asymptomatic* patients” 

Don’t misquote me. 

Here’s [one detailing abnormal lung scans ground glass syndrome. Here’s [This outlines cardiac complications young athletes. [This details neurological effects. It’s hard Google, bud. Yeah kids go private school back school January. People got covid course. happens. single parent/child died covid. vaccines out. one going back home learning completely unnecessary, especially anyone wants vaccine one.  volume positive tests simply doesn’t add effectiveness vaccine delta spread.

Maybe it’s PCR lateral flow testing trash, could likely Masks even required school year state   Well, exactly thing. numbers vastly different UK, positive cases vaccinations. can't simply transpose proportions Denmark.

Probably much less research Germany beggining pandemic (I trying find link post here) believes many 93% cases missed. Surely number much smaller could well still clear majority nowadays.

I think 40% population totally believable. least 18 months virus deemed heavily contagious. thats pretty much original comment said legislative aspect would difficult think much likely type federal mandate. 

The important thing right putting vaccines arms. worry next pandemic one. 

It’s fine emotional upset situation, end day solves absolutely nothing. need convince distrust government, Fauci, science get vaccine. Money reasonable way accomplish this. care employers mandate vaccinations workers, coalition leading medical groups said Monday, cases Covid-19 continue spike across nation. ""As health care community leads way requiring vaccines employees, hope employers across country follow lead implement effective policies encourage vaccination,"" according joint statement 56 health care associations. Requiring vaccination employment ""logical fulfillment ethical commitment"" patients care, according groups. Stop spamming comment many posts. result temp ban continue. sure place ask this, parent found tested positive covid. really shown symptoms far, got tested earlier week results came back negative. However, last night super thirsty, drank sip water (really dumb hindsight, know). We're vaccinated, screwed I? :(   point gov make list required medical procedures fine exemptors. try weird proxy insurance companies? That's incorrect. saying ""Pretty sure many country higher number unvaccinated athletes"" I'm saying countries something. stating plural country countries. I've put mask back even though I've fully vaxed (moderna) couple months. friend caught way too, lost taste/smell almost 2 weeks.. symptoms. 

We idea longterm neurological issues possible even vaccination short-term harm unlikely. Plus, latest info Delta transmission indicates still roughly 20% chance passing others even vaxxed. That's nothing.
 
I'm pissed willfully unvaccinated. Wtf *next* mutation going look like? society function 10s millions people neurological disorders decade? like this. I'm saying US island authority implement shit national level. things Australia Singapore Taiwan viable even population supported it.

Now could possible state level cases. Hawaii lot stuff. less strenuously lesser results. Though less populated islands like Kauai basically get covid zero points. found today nephew caught it, seemingly probably last couple days school came Sunday.... that's rather unlucky!

Given private schools university broken slightly earlier (most state schools open last Friday) significant driver 24's certainly agree think end term looks like likely contributor drop cases. Well can’t really wear mask restaurant Looking like right call prioritise lifting final restrictions schools closed, despite fact cases rising fast time.

Hopefully time schools go back gets colder, lot people fully vaxxed, natural immunity extra mixing, restrictions need reimposed. think idea public health authorities acting interest population keeping catching spreading deadly disease everyone best chance living normal life span. invading army keeping everyone house arrest nefarious reasons.

At least that's think it.  trend holding would extremely positive implications. Specifically, since wave clearly meaningfully stress hospital system, would strong evidence high mobility societies high vaccination rates less function normally inevitable ups downs cycle cases.  goddamned advice whole time. delusional naive think unvaccinated people ever going commit staying away public spaces price stupidity? Absolute insanity. It’s sad! least could look extending family restrictions allow non-US citizen grandparents in, parents. know that’s hard prove given it’s birth certificate whatever, many people grandparents old babies young get vaccine.

Honestly Fauci came book deal already, he's killed credability profiting pandemic. Country’s* ftfy 🧐 right, got mixed person. apologies. Vaccinated people live society, right? somehow live separate parallel society everything fine? 

I've vaccinated, gotten glimpse wonderful place seem live in. Nice choice airline picture Yes, please.

One thing get sub much ink spilled mask mandates FDA fully approving vaccine -- would likely spur many employers make vaccine mandatory ultimately good reducing spread. Imo, FDA sitting hands long inexcusable, yet gets fraction attention. School going summer break seems like likely cause drop cases. 

Not sure level data easily available, would curious see drop predominantly coming children. 

Even that's case though, less infected children might eligible cause cases drop [not quickly though] age groups. 

Fantastic news UK either way! Flu vaccines take long make, there's many strains flu, time they've brewed seasonal batch lot times ends wrong one settle whatever cross-immunity get it. get right pretty effective.

With mRNA vaccine manufacture much quickly, theoretically could make single vaccine covers many flu strains eliminate guessing game entirely. there's lot promise there. People underemployed unemployed pay low (or no) taxes. Tax credits mean nothing them. argument this. 

Vaccines 1 many tools toolbox. use tools disposal?

If could choose better masks, ventilation vaccination I’d choose 3. 

But that’s I’m willing whatever takes get covid first place. 

It’s hospitalized death. 25% people suffer ‘long covid’ diminishes quality life. 

There’s people mild versions illness still suffer longcovid. could even suffer even you’re fully vaccinated! Good point thank you. know people spectrum 'mild' one, sort stupidly assumed could make decision. Sometimes stories really touch me. homeless vaccinated give jobs said commenter, that's fair. suggestion, personally even think benefits outweigh everything else terms interacting posters. responding reporting shuts immediately without giving chance spread faulty logic.

But that's take, understand wanting make sure anyone else reads correct info available. Either way, thanks providing facts. Yeah, really confusing me. dark place emotionally last year early part 2021. idea going back masks restrictions just...idk I'll do, frankly. even call particularly social person, year without people loved ones consider every decision 534754389646 angles really in. clinging good news ever get it, guess assumed would same. Nah it’s pass great time vaccinated don’t get sunburn sleeping beach morning!

But real sure getting little jab big deal. Rather feel bit drag couple days dying choking putrefying lungs. Yeah, WAG point.

Get vaccines, people. claim 1/4 people work with. legit one them. 30-day positivity rates 2% 4.5%. readily translate 'way cases we're aware testing.' Given Italy's aging population... there's big difference think.

80% eligible population bigger deal 80% US population would be, given US way younger people.

Huge positive news Italy. I'm defend particular country's response covid pandemic. plenty hate everywhere.

I live US especially lot hate here!   Maybe they'd test safety first, vaccine safe could justify emergency use without yet knowing effective? Kids barely get sick think ""good"" part would we're along, cases would start dropping sooner people currently predicting will? 

I agree wording odd. close friend RN currently close getting hospitalized COVID. Young healthy. That’s basically boils to. doesn’t want backlash putting back effect puts burden business. majority won’t it, especially since peak tourism season. 

If we’re honest majority businesses weren’t enforcing mandate effect way. either way population treated like donkeys. I'm sure getting vaccinated took lock seriously too. /S First second shot exactly same. won’t question it, they’ll happy came 2nd shot. true Europe denying entry people vaccinated Sinovac?  every new variant lot travel restrictions implemented prevent coming countries, pretty much zero succes rate. point would think countries would give I'm sure new variant comes... Yeah don’t get it. thought people followed subreddit following either

 A) concerned virus want date keep safe 

B) stay date latest science. 

The fact people B makes wonder people even here? partners Italian colleague stoll want it.

I'm getting tired shit Fluid vaccines pretty good, issue there's like 5 different flu strains every year. According CDC's latest model, agency predicts next three weeks, may 90,000 800,000 new cases — huge range. Showing even larger disparity, CDC estimates week ending August 14, average 10,000 infections day 100,000. Gottlieb believes range indication agency good sense outbreak headed. Except you’re wearing properly, definitely doesn’t. metal strip fit face! 1 perfect enemy good

2 ah yes, Fauci think something ""handjobs_for_crack"" came reddit. Hands one dumbest mentalities have. point you’re likely end hospital die. 

Just getting vaccinated doesn’t mean can’t still catch virus transmit doesn’t mean avoid together  suddenly dont care homeless anymore COVID?  every doctor world disagrees without you. Google works. Bruh that's textbook definition theater. Also, required places already? changed? Oh! much hope too, crossing fingers father able special experience I’m saying people immune compromised stay indoors, risk vaccine risk disease. 3 options right them. I’m saying risk referring “can’t get it”  People going wear masks ask again, like prolly half vaccinated people say fuck certainly bulk unvaccinated people. You’re gonna start criminalizing that’s going mess. Total catch 22 think we’ll see. Yeah never claimed 1000x infectious Medically speaking, ""outbreak""

It's term different meanings different contexts; sometimes used mean ""two linked cases"", sometimes means ""more cases expected"".

Look policy detail, fuzzy - enough healthy players (and isolation rules stricter unvaccinated) that's one thing, also mentions ""government authorities, medical experts, Commissioner's discretion"" reason postpone game. No, they're free get vaccine. suffer consequences choice like restricted travel, restricted access places pose viral spread risk, etc. likely need tackle tribalism disinformation around vaccination really move needle. Right things headed direction states. Eeeeexactly! foments even refusal think ones power realize that.   Worth mentioning though, outdoor serving still without need proof negative test. It’s almost never doctor refuses get vaccinated. Unfortunately lump healthcare statistics nurses doctors equally educated frustrating There’s real world data justifies mixing vaccines yet. Better wait data first.

Besides, cases (assuming you’re health well), you’ll experience light symptoms done it. understand vulnerable family members young kids, extra shot doesn’t come without risks(especially unknown now)   Wat I'm really sorry deal this. Man fuck people. care others, care them.   Yep. live outside Savannah. mandate government buildings, early childcare facilities, hospitals, transportation. 

This isn’t sweeping mandate recommendation businesses city schools. 

The schools probably end guarantee majority businesses won’t be.

Edit: city, Chatham County. triple insurance premiums mandate employer can't cover extra costs. Q1 it’s context link, enough infection team causes cancellation game. 90%+ doses somministrated doses available, considering must save emergency second doses, can't more.
Source various graphs division regions etc: Ah, yes. 'ol ""it impressive paying attention, therefore bad."" Bruh. would bar restaurant even bother mandated lmao You’re accounting natural immunity well. Delta symptoms show lot sooner original strand it’s underreported drastically. could lot closer peak think. Also fully vaccinated population terribly far UK. we've learned anything summer, vaccine mandates way pandemic.

NYC it: it: schools employers same:  It’s always schools! I’m teacher I’ve lost track amount times told weren’t risk schools weren’t infection vector! many times proven wrong now? 8? 9? Civil Service generally plays blinder, get involved. Fortunate UK, smart PM since Wilson Thatcher (choose, based affiliations). Symptoms don’t appear immediately. hydrating find absurd imagine people can't look stats mRNA vaccine recognize sure bet going somehow intelligent enough grasp varying mechanisms action different vaccines! idea scientific rational basis resistance risible. *shocked Pikachu face* would everyone vaccinated?? vast, vast majority cases appears so, many things 'Your Mileage May Vary' kicks cases. Breakthrough cases ( extremely small numbers ) resulted severe covid even death ( usually concert health issue ).

Most people still shouold get vaccinated. Breakthroughs minority far, severe breakthroughs minority that. implementing 400 week FINE taking test terrible way get people vaccinated instead breeds additional mis trust group already hesitant.

I absolutely understand need get people vaccinated fast possible - reach herd immunity well protected covid new variants, doesn’t mean need create punitive punishments people may already struggling survive. Ignorance FB platform alone probably responsible chunk COVID deaths indirect manner.

They absolutely enough prevent spread false information. Saw interesting thought Times today Euros.

 Basically England well euros, meant large groups young people reluctant getting vaccine exposed virus counted immune time being. dont think 4th lockdown matter happens 

It took peak nearing 2,000 deaths day firce third one.

Then goverment named july 19th *freedom day* Hey - found guy article talking about! Even though I'm introvert, hated constant zoom calls missed person interaction. seeing people person! know employee VA. got vaccinated 1st time became available still masks whenever inside.
Quite opposite many coworkers Don’t worry man - I’m vaccinated well good Missouri great right overall vaccinations like 40%      definitely go lick doorknobs find. need hurry thing along rest us get back normal life. country whole would implement this, even temporarily. time get ahead Delta potential new variants, later find deadly are, etc.  ""Explained"" season 2 episode, ""The Next Pandemic"" Nov 7, 2019. Let people enjoy things    cant say meant whom, one thing ive come across talking vaccine statistics; people talk vaccination percentage among adult population (since children certain age arent eligible vaccine, counted risk factors infection afaik) thus yielding higher numbers. I'm layperson scientific background, looks like simply re-gained herd immunity.

There many data issues questions covid hard draw real conclusions it. UK something like 55% fully vaccinated, 10% infected recovered. commonly agreed ""true"" infections 4 times higher what's reported high-testing countries like UK, probably close 40% infected. assume (admittedly based nothing) half overlap (recovered also later vaccinated), country would 75% immunity - right around number theorized along herd immunity threshold covid. covid metrics behaved like would expect country that's roughly herd immune.

But delta. Delta contagious, contagiousness disease major variable herd immunity equation. sudden, 75% immunity became insufficient. longer herd immune. presumably still terribly far it, right? much immunity required? Looking numbers UK, uptrend started picking steam month half ago. Since time, they've 1.2 million cases reported. Using 4x idea, that'd 5 million cases reality - around 7.5% population country. also vaccinated something like another 1% population time. 

So maybe simply herd immunity level required Delta variant something like 9 10% higher previous ones? You’re fucking moron.   doesn't, forever human population.  ""HIPPA"" rights? Except vaccine prevent spread, all.

60 percent double vaccinated individuals 3 week stagger doses exhibit symptoms contagious... Don’t think even able leave house imo mean start going got vaccinated feel like reading articles since beginning pandemic sadly answer continues same: know depends.  Could people outside getting vaccinated causing distortion? IIRC Gibraltar example vaccinated people residents leading lot people work don’t live there.   Olympics brilliant far mate. tend find it’s 35’s watch it. Really enjoying Tokyo. don’t know schedule

They’ve months get sorted. I'm super pro-vaxx refreshed Doctolib website like crazy moment announced people age could get leftover dose. said understand doubts people new vaccine. admit 20 previous vaccines probably enough time tested, unlike COVID vaccines. think worrying long term effects legit, refusing get vaccinated Facebook post said dangerous acceptable all. now, significant, serious side effect, would heard given many people different countries taken full jabs. many people gathering inside watch F1

The track outside? still it. nearly bad. tongue isnt swollen. Ill get red patches white elsewhere. Gets worse alcohol. Yeah, maybe smartassery sarcasm. Saying so-called ""Experts"" would say actual experts. implying refused believe actual experts due believing experts, would start now? That's stupid use car analogy. appropriate comparing different fuel injection systems: output powering car. Hundreds millions people vaccine absolutely fine. People like need get head arses get vaccinated economy lockdown aliments start recovering. Might want loom word sarcasm dictionary. original point sarcasm implying vaccinated listen experts. expected. like this. Let's see fiscally responsible folks really would welcome official vaccine passport. HB attracts “free dumb” maskholes valley. That’s protests masks political rallies denying results. 

The OC — embarrassing coastal CA eons. What's next, private business requiring shirts shoes? dangerous path allowed. You’re slightly exaggerating. We’re still vaccinating almost half million people per day. yes, need keep pushing higher numbers achieve goal 70-80 %.

Right infections relatively low. Add holiday season. Lots people across nation traveling, many may wanted commit appointments. 

But incidences many places rising already everyone comes back trips likely facing another semi lockdown least restrictions. hope would gets people motivated get vaccinated. Especially restrictions Fall surpassed way. Sports subs offseason fucking amazing. Quite possible reasons, likely extent combination:

* Antibodies adults surpassing 90% across UK.
* Schools breaking summer course July (late June Scotland)
* Euros leading reduction parties/household mixing.
* Recent heatwave drawing people outdoors/opening windows, increasing ventilation.
* Waves 'Pingdemic' self-isolation advice NHS effectively locking portion population might otherwise spread virus.

All happening quick succession tandem one another. grand hopeful outcome we've reached herd immunity, think we're yet. likely lot fortunate timing hopefully utilised next weeks drive protection vaccinations restrict surge step 4 rollback something relatively negligible. Fingers crossed! Masks security theater, especially vaccinated. help little staying home things like limiting occupancy buildings works better. story mess.  Indiana numbers low know right now, month apparent. 98%-99% hospitalized patients unvaccinated still seems providing robust protection there, I'd assume symptomatic protection would 65%-90% (3x-10x) range places reported seems true I'm actually shocked find neighborhood, Williamsburg, average 48%. weeks find number packed bars masks sight. “CDC data” laugh problem fucking unfair! Citizens green card holders go anywhere want, vaccinated not, can't visit family despite fully vaccinated. funny, ""proof"" unvaccinated? Oh right! going crappy places like 😏  OK. Also here's 200k bill hospital admission since taking space people really need bed. seen well. Trying keep understand personal risks regardless masking, another vaccine, new normal. keep telling still new, science still working theories things still constantly changing. Consider donating developing countries can. company matched donation. sure every dollar helps!  Get catered to? Lmao know disability system works?  Nope, conceding nothing. I'm putting forward one clear path sued, I'm bringing Dominion case good example ongoing defamation lawsuit.

Mercola made claims knows false. medical license make clear expertise know claims false. claims damaging reputation bottom line companies. question whether they'll choose go him. Tax credits usually tied taxable income. really think low-wage worker dead set getting vax going throwing extra $25 whatever? Everything closed fast everyone adapted. Previously, struggle.

Now it’s hardest part. government resist temptation drop restrictions hold till numbers gets much much lower. went back looked news reporting 90% chiefs players vaccinated mother-in-law (67) refused get vaccine thinks allergic one ingredients mRNA vaccines, polyethylene glycol. doctor told get vaccine anyway allergy undetectable certainly severe, course trying find compound vaccines use excuse get either.

Today came cough, sore throat, fever. getting COVID test tomorrow appointments booked area today, tomorrow earliest could get rapid test. Things looking good, tried everything could convince get vaccine. Yea friends I’ll never see way last 4 years. Yep. Little signs past start make sense. friend found could sew suddenly asked repair children’s clothing. friend announces going sponsor daughter’s party buy cake. know, think I’m venting lol.. yeah, person isn’t vaxxed amd goes restaurants. 4.16 million deaths attributed COVID-19 7.8 billion people. 0.04% chance dying COVD-19, worth locking society shutting commerce?  number becomes even minuscule comorbidities. truly needs fine penalty social media companies spreading misinformation.

If can't stop it, exist  archive link available Good. Here's abstract. Basically compared people got two doses AstraZeneca (a classic viral vector based vaccine), people got AstraZeneca, Pfizer (an mRNA vaccine) 2nd shot. found Pfizer(mRNA) 2nd shot better job boosting immunity:

**Abstract** 
Currently approved viral vector-based mRNA-based vaccine approaches coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) consider homologous prime-boost vaccination. reports thromboembolic events, several European governments recommended using AstraZeneca’s ChAdOx1-nCov-19 (ChAd) individuals older 60 years, leaving millions already ChAd-primed individuals decision receive either second shot ChAd heterologous boost mRNA-based vaccines.

Lol. It’s relative. think we’ve figured never 100% goes away. dims can’t find new places hide meantime something fit evolves.  Yeah, still owe £9k per year. Delta changing things. People’s behavior also radically changed since early spring 

Could fine, new factors play think see 62% Italy. you’re talking city ? that’s case, good ! people experience first hand dangers pandemic, motivates vaccinate… shame antivax don’t share opinion. leave country bury father. Never allowed back in. Visa expired. Consulates illegally refusing renew visas Europeans. Full approval winter 2020 early 2021? think you’re year  think everyone get vaccinated, show ""papers"" get somewhere overstepping line.

Genuinely curious: thoughts ""showing papers"" vaccines prior Covid?

Proof vaccination required K-12 school systems, colleges, many camps international travel. Granted, parent travel country, may encountered before.

Considering votes getting, want emphasize asked respectfully.   Went piano bar Saturday LA called Tramp Stamp Granny’s. required proof vax. happy. Please let thing know two people, separately, breakthrough cases. Neither go hospital, ass week. see trials cv vaccines starting 18s.)

I'm curious rules informed consent apply young able understand. applies, course, cv19, vaccine trials children.)

There's fair amount shit incoming topic I'd really like able understand better, controversial sub? Three weeks someone way know, would using tool make money. Don’t forget Florida. heard 6 ambulances yesterday alone, open... 🤷‍♀️ live die it.

FTFY. Jebaited hope bars restaurants this. fully vaccinated brother law currently Covid, caught attending soccer game really make difference?

The vaccine trains immune system catch virus earlier. earlier faster immune system catches kills virus particles, less damage virus lungs less chance die drowning fluids. 

The vaccine increases quantity quality immune response virus (more antibodies also specialized antibodies recognize virus quicker). 

It's like US Special Forces vs someone passed boot camp. faced enemy know fire gun, one want side? somebody shooting would rather one soldier side 20? 

Delta means there's enemies per exposure. mean always win, helps odds. Apart Melbourne many weeks lockdown Australians restrictions like outside them?

In reply comment, propose alternative hotel quarantine? Yes, opening frontier, even unvaccinated people, still presents risk. letting guard around (only) 50% population vaccinated also risk.


It's mentioning Vegas metric shows ignorance disregard actual situation abroad.  muh slippery slope get vaccinated? studies saw showed 99% newborns robust covid antibodies moms vaccinated pregnancy, think early third trimester. data yet long last, good period right delivery.

And since they’ve found antibodies vaccinated women’s cord blood breastmilk, implies baby would protection even vaccinated months ago gestation. honor system relies honor. That's problem honor system. red light running analogy imperfect, endanger responsible, law-abiding drivers. unvaxxed mostly threat unvaxxed. say let develop immunity naturally ASAP, virus chance mutate something vaccine-resistant. yeah honestly really *should* know always assume worst point  lost two nice neighbours this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wow. sure owned me.

I know important protect others. That's spent year wearing masks indoors (even places like family gatherings one else wore them), that's took two doses new vaccine authorized yet government. literally fully vaccinated, contributed population getting herd immunity ending pandemic, feel like job done precautions like still wearing masks unnecessary point.

I've read various news come out. know Pfizer dose effective (even Delta variant) stopping dying, spreading others. I've read CDC says okay resume normal activities again. pose little risk anyone receiving virus me. bringing coffins means nothing that. fall 2020.

As far I'm concerned, responsibility lies solely unvaccinated get jab. Start using vaccine passports, start testing unvaccinated. tell go back wearing masks like fully vaccinated, simply needed. Chalk worst news day far. 
What huge disappointment. 
I hope see clarification answering major questions related potential rollout timing change needed. 
I hope timeline isn’t pushed 2022 found lot instances myocarditis / pericarditis. miserable year, I'm glad able make people laugh. vaccinated? so, consider self-helped. I’m happy see this. ""trends"" downward july 25th. Hard call single day drop averages trend. looks, like assumed, mix first dose Sputnik V second dose Oxford/AZ. Makes sense - first dose easier manufacture Ad26 used ithas low prevalence human population (and, memory serves, confer long-lasting immunity), second dose difficult manufacture (also, Ad5 higher prevalence) . using Oxford/AZ second dose kind get best both: different vectors different doses, easier manufacturing, low prevalence first vector pre-existing immunity second vector (since uses simian adenovirus). Yep. state 38% vaccinated. walk local Target grocery store see 1% shoppers masked. We're also experiencing nice little Covid bump, thanks fucking lot Missouri anti-vaxxers!   could finally finish developing vaccines inhale would bypass issue storage/needles/product costs. concern last year children would super spreaders get parents/grandparents sick. threat greatly diminished among care health. rest made choice want feel powerful importantly believe smarter ""elites"".

Then need go work get degree least study. want fly bad enough, going sprout wings back? people need get ushered back reality letting children families die it. administration needs start acting like adults room get vaccines every arm medically handle it. Period. End story. let child keep sticking hand hot stove plead stop apologize hurting fee fees. put safety mechanisms place prevent call shit punish try touch stove. want act like children vaccines FaceBook, treat like grow function adult society.  No. That's rooted science. There's reason waste 2 vaccines previously infected. Send countries. Good point. ok, they've got plenty water lungs gimmie dat multi-strain mRNA flu vaccine. 2nd dose Pfizer May 15. planning go Nepal September. think get 3rd dose, maybe moderna? forgot definitely correct. Greenpoint 70% vaxxed  3 weeks mask mandates lifted office Texas mandating masks office 🤣🤣🤣 Dis thing never gonna end.

Meanwhile fully vaccinated husband got covid 5 days ago still somewhat concerning albeit mild symptoms loss small slight fatigue exerting himself. probably I’m asymptomatic (tested negative). Fuck this. It’s knowing end kills :( favorite thing say people anti-vax: “Do remember Polio Smallpox? No, don’t, choice. Everyone got vaccine. lined children schools everyone got it.”

(Or old enough remember, remember getting vaccine.) Valentine said wishes vaccine process Trump would elected, Biden people gotten vaccine,"" said. ""The information place.""

Wrong, ""the Biden people"" believe science easily fooled conman spouting magical nonsense.   it’s always better need need it! talking people interest reality  Trump would elected, Biden people gotten vaccine,"" said. ""The information place.""

Same shit right end. even generic ‘man regret giant asshole’, nope it’s that. Oh well, let us know future ventilator goes guess. You’re right. Thanks catching that, edited OC. tech ready go contract tracing well. assume talking people got AZ first dose mRNA vaccine second dose. combination pretty common Canada. probably people don’t want get vaccinated. lot people haven’t able get vaccinated yet. aware correct acronym. That's used quotation marks around ""HIPPA"". cnbc article explained like study, published Nature Medicine Monday, found adding Pfizer Moderna vaccines second dose J&amp;J led better immune response two doses J&amp;J vaccine well tolerated. vaccinations performed Jan. 10 April 8. NY made vaccine passports never actually used anything risk/benefit vaccines children different older populations. I'm sure still safer, get wrong, there's reason processes place.  Well, adults want vaccinated are. Gottlieb, expert would consider excessively optimistic, predicted US’s current spike peak 2-3 weeks. 

This makes wonder CDC Biden Administraton wait weeks see he’s right making decision whether push masks again. 

If Gottlieb right, think they’d leave guidance. 

If cases still going Late August/Early September, think they’ll new mask recommendation.   know seat belts don’t prevent 100% fatalities car crashes? Totally pointless wear them! would like suggest everyone send $4.99 instead. don’t to! It’s suggestion. still understand Trump Operation Warp Speed vaccines triumph saving America world.

My issue comes start *mandating* think one problems spending time professional managerial class inside CDC high levels government. obviously think everyone country outlook things colleagues do, makes decisions based logic, evidence, latest information. also assume everyone forgiving bosses, stable jobs, plenty money time work.

This may seem understandable general, would think anyone working public health would much realistic outlook.  would that? require vaccine attend.

It better see tiers protection.

Hand washing, social distance mask. Keyword: effective decreasing LIKELIHOOD getting covid.

Masks acts barrier reduces amount covid breathe somewhat “breathing in”. interaction like walking someone asking question likelihood low.

However, masked within 6ft stay like let say hours. risk starts increasing.
- think galloon water poured straw. gonna get soaked, stay long enough get soaked

No mask distancing highest risk. 
- think running rain split second

So people still getting sick mask/social distancing points back keywords likelihood.

27% quite high. 14% average it.
Certainly higher risks vaccination.

Vaccination shown safe Israel. Canada US 12-18 year olds. 0-27% risk long Covid great least yet well-understood. need *choice* seen anyone saying ""gee, human race vegans, zoonotic viral epidemics every 5 10 years!""

I assume that's bridge far people point. loved ones got vaccinated I’m worried. could worry dying car wreck, exceptionally likely dying covid post vaccination. Yet I’m still able live life. 

Maybe living perpetual state fear something almost zero chance happening isnt healthiest decision. I’m actually Braves fan, also suck think game worse 😂 ended cancelling, talking family said aversion outdoors mainly heatwave whatever coming (they’re getting can’t handle extreme heat anymore). I’m gonna watch cases try come September ideally October it’s hopefully nice things better! Thanks advice. would like know too. annoying side effects first shot (loss taste, loss stamina, horrifying headache, several hours massive hair loss), really concerning second - 102.3 fever day (and baseline 97.5), nerve pain legs days, eye strain, kidneys liver agony, full week cognitive deficits brain fog. 

I mean, yes, better actually COVID still would really worry 3rd shot would me. disappointed dismissed pandemic politized it. propaganda surrounding, masks, vaccine, bullshit conjured daily really tedious. think ever able come back damage normalizing bad behavior rejecting common sense done. honor system fails, mask mandates put place. either masks everyone vaccine passports sadly. Sure ideal perfectly reasonable rational it. table localized bubble spit flying around. walk restaurant going intersecting many ""bubbles"" increase risk covid transmission wearing mask.

It's making hard choices! said ""lockdown working"".... sort imply want lockdown remain.

So, want something working? True employee get unemployment unless get fired misconduct something along  lines. Even could still get fight Bear Week there. wild party. effectiveness dirty N95 carried around pocket put enter building? that's real populations real human beings real life expected wear N95s. y’all think it’s true restrictions nothing situation, masks useless without physical distancing, vice versa?

I’ve seeing sentiments circulating around sub I’m sure it’s truth. Honor system work dishonorable. however know delta cdc put guidance already US. knew coming pipe. 

Based US human behavior unknown good chunk pop still young vax, seems like waiting another month two unmasking would good idea. homeschooled son past year didn’t dig hard find great secular curriculum. Look Israel’s latest study. It’s Pfizer normal dosing schedule (3 weeks apart) shows waning immunity time (as well less protection Delta). Controlled age. Protection quite low (20%? Don’t quote me) Delta fully vaxxed January. Still good numbers (75% think) fully vaxxed April beyond, good protection across board death. 

If don’t mind asking, vaccine relatives receive get 2nd dose?  idk noticed, hot FUCK whole summer. definitely carefree, codi19 aside. heat kept house nearly every day. passed work friday. fuck talkin carefree summer? think covid biggest issue right baaaaad news. stated accurate statement. Vaccinated people shouldn’t need wear masks around vaccinated people. issue isn’t message , it’s dumbass mouth breathers getting vaccinated amd social media. really moron disagree one. Continue crying characterization. Google that, argument. Yes, exactly. tone media much commentariat US last month two stupid deplorables get vaccinated, fact covid still raging somehow fault.

There's certainly least truth this, course, ultimately change anything what's going on, anything solve problem afflicting United States. Go back rock. would go far say made amends also long term effects covid brain function pneumonia Wow kudos robustness! encourage unsubscribe ""unplug"" 🙏 Actually sounds like need boosters every six months so. 

I mean, still better vaccine all, assuming study holds, one finds really fucking discouraging? seems like we're looking world many people refusing get vaccinated all, rely rest us show twice year get new shots. guarantee there's going drop additional round...  cases came crashing Spring Summer looked like worst behind us. Unfortunately news Delta pulling back in. I'm trying best strike good balance. study? know friend said vaccine (one mRNA ones) didn’t help long covid symptoms all. asked helped, since heard many anecdotes helping people suffered long covid. Damn shit scary, glad got shots. don’t think India keeping wild Corona virus control think high percentage Indian population virus even notice it. thing happened Brazil back wave. AFAIK consensus due lack adequate healthcare hygiene. convention insane idea. think individual amendments would right way forward modifying constitution. also don’t think there’s enough consensus either way. No. two legitimate points view issue. one scientific truth vaccines save lives, everything else simply wrong, stupidly wrong that.  no. freedom choice choices kill people. put mask I’m suggesting condescending people discourages ever getting vaccinated Yes, people India live top less desirable conditions would excellent immune systems live start with.
There another variant India doubt going happen easy way virus crosses species species ?
It going wild ride. do??? could get mentality could get back normal live lives again. 

The goal never eradicate COVID. It’s stay. goal “make sure hospitals don’t get overwhelmed” since capacity constraints real big danger. 

Well we’ve done that. hospitals still deal COVID nobody make hard decisions gets oxygen doesn’t now. 

So we’re done. People need accept life comes risks COVID one them. also get vaccinated eligible. here. state government asks start wearing mask indoors will, won’t worry much since county pushing 85% vaccinated.

I’ll avoiding places they’ll ignore state orders mostly aren’t vaccinated.

I’m never getting plane without real N95 again. underestimate severe GOP-written constitution would be. control state legislatures, would control entire process constitutional convention. carlin stupid average person is, realize half stupider that. almost guarantee every state student winds ICU covid. 10s 1000s already have, statistically math there. want know happens happen?

Science says ""get vaccine already"".

Get vaccine get seriously ill, dead.

Some useful got Pfizer, actually. did. 2nd vaxx end March. 

I read topline Israel study - something like houser vaxx 39% protective getting Covid - think mayve connected Delta specifically? generally? 

I’m fully vaxxed getting tested tomorrow. hear CDC maybe changing mask requirements fully vaccinated folks soon. think it’s good extra careful, delta crashing communities &amp; vaccinated folks get swept it. going also retroactively pay vaccinated people, otherwise next time (booster next pandemic) people almost certainly hold get check it. still masks required job, travel locations still requiring negative test results enter, still wear masks flights, borders aren’t fully open, theres still talk masks schools upcoming semester...that’s normal. It’s huge step right direction back normal. basically line thinking well. Living respiratory issues chronic energy deficits would suck, damn it, want enjoy food. Sensory impairments really worst. doubt there's 160 million Americans vaccine injury stories past. childhood vaccines fine, reason think one fine. Anyone vaccine injury, vaccine. immune system. Getting covid would probably good thing they'd wind sick well. IE people stupid nowadays. Shit, antivaxxers around polio, would still thing. may worst it. Things really starting get bad. expect things get worse see occupancy restrictions come back. Dumbass CDC told people masks come vaccinated. could've thought anti-maskers would also antivaxxers? 🤔🙄

This country's response pandemic people's selfishness appalling. Dr. Fauci literally said today CDC talking changing guidance. Like world, refuse vaccine disease get disease, hospital you. chance avoid chose ignore that. go Trump ask pay hospital stay, cause HES reason didnt get it.  Looking high risk two year old daughter young vaccine, disappointed answer. try isolate best can, still go work. vaccine months away, depending generosity others. want like others vilify you, get it, masks big deal. aren't. please, least empathize people like me. talking created two major Vaccines US. vaccines Australia New Zealand created? Texas nothing without support federal government. vote charge CDC bc yes exactly done. CDC gave wrong information goal preserving mask availability medical staff. pretty big fucking mistake. goal good one. point revised ""we know"" ""yes, wear masks"" happened. ""you need mask"" happened between, known false. Conspiracy nuts assholes around thrive kind inconsistency messaging. gone ""we know"" ""yes, wear masks"" nothing between, things would much better off.

And ""an excuse"" — still wear mask go even though I'm fully vaccinated. recognizing fuel anti-mask sentiment came from.  days graduated 5 years ago! least that's happened me. recently read history 1918 pandemic someone NIH wrote 2010. 

Much seemed eerily like could describing last 12 months. situation improving getting vaccinated? That's like sticking hand hot stove waiting burning stop. gonna happen remove hand. think 1 part missing here. One way another people get covid. far spread going anywhere. need live breakthrough infections happen. said, still carefree going around maskless? yet, still treatments develop people vaccinate. come time soon. Yup. Idk making decisions CDC W.T.F? W.T.F? Lay people able call BS yet are. Australia extreme lockdowns first world opened back up. see something right? going lock October? That’s studies found. paper linked pretty exhaustive review available evidence portion conclusion pasted below. 

I also add appreciate skepticism, IMO, make mistakes many skeptical people (myself included) make confronted decision policy doesn’t seem sensible based know. One tendency assume intent decision policy. Often, assumption informed conscious unconscious biases. Second assume know processes, discussions evidence went policy decision. Third may consider possible explanations decision policy. 

I done many times learn people involved decision policy looking level far deeper imagine weighing possible complicating factors things even thought of. course doesn’t stop getting annoyed seem surface stupid decisions policy. 

Okay, text link. 

“Our review literature offers evidence favor widespread mask use source control reduce community transmission: Nonmedical masks use materials obstruct particles necessary size; people infectious initial period postinfection, common symptoms (45, 46, 141); nonmedical masks effective reducing transmission respiratory viruses; places time periods mask usage required widespread shown substantially lower community transmission.

The available evidence suggests near-universal adoption nonmedical masks public, combination complementary public health measures, could successfully reduce Re

Models suggest public mask wearing effective reducing spread virus compliance high (39). recommend mask use requirements implemented governments, or, governments not, organizations provide public-facing services. mandates must accompanied measures ensure access masks, possibly including distribution rationing mechanisms become discriminatory. Given value source control principle, especially presymptomatic people, sufficient employees wear masks; customers must wear masks comment higher 🙌🙌  Manitoba does. Need show proof vaccination get theatre stadium. sit people outside household restaurant. fence exactly? 17 months since trials started. Billions shots given world. thing they're fence admitting really want vaccine reasons. Emotional, scientific reasons. Yes, true almost everyone gets covid survives. Especially younger are. also true almost everyone dying Covid unvaccinated. hard choice.  think people much credit vaccines much weather/disease trends spring case drops. saw thing last spring/summer drops summer surge places people congregate (hot states). 

Hopefully people get vaxed. Fortunately risk people are. concerned politics, concerned public health.

Lol. Yeah, US government definitely merit-based. Yes, it’s possible, anecdotally office worker health conscious, sacrifice getting best work reviews opting eat breakfast dinner home. field (accounting) team frequently comes early stays late they’re providing breakfast dinner. seriously received annual reviews work product good lacking “team spirit” since work 6pm team dinner break finish work 7pm go home cook dinner. complaint effected “review score” resulted smaller annual raise/cost living adjustment. think type attitude work place needs go.

As another anecdote habits, last week let boss know couldn’t make impromptu 7:30am meeting b/c work class time boss got mad told work different day mentioned never works out. Hard form habit work disrupts worried job security. I’m lucky spouse w steady job too, politely firmly told boss wouldn’t showing ruffled feathers, overall ok. imagine someone less secure life wanting take risk. perpetual state fear

I wear seatbelt ride car, mean drive ""perpetual state fear."" also buy fire insurance, wear helmet ride bike. brush teeth, go dentist couple times year.

I'm claiming get medal this. things mean developed healthy respect realities situation, I'm weird state total denial. I’m seeing people complaining shaking hands. tons people thinking combined stomach bug + sinus infection based social media feeds, they’ve socialized people delta. definitely sympathize them, would change habits current situation stands. Children 12 already low risk COVID, minuscule number 12 can't get vaccine medical reasons. individuals would probably best served self-isolating months let illness spread rapidly anti-vaccine population, anyway. Herd immunity inevitable end-game, one way another.   think ever met normal person homeschooled kid. Kids need person social interaction. Maybe hybrid / online school Fall, kids get vaccinated schools need back person. wish fantastically lower. 90 - 98% lower. Makes 50 year old vaccinated male likely die covid car accident. new future another way die age. People die don’t get vaccinated.

So instead smug superior let’s engage human beings, eh? Maybe save life. Shit, past 4 days so, FOX NEWS even gone pro vaccine. say something lol understand that, also high school similar age bracket, likely similar concerns. said something similar. Set target date mask mandates removed, say July 1st. 45 days announcement. would given people goal.  nephew double vaxxed Pfizer went Disney World Florida vacation. came back covid sick whole week far (fever, loss taste smell, sleeping 15 hours day). 26 way. Completely incorrect. Countries locked eliminated virus best economic health outcomes time. short lockdown week two followed months zero restrictions. Sydney paying price refusing lockdown long. South Australia Victoria end lockdowns tomorrow, beat virus week again. NZ community case since February. 


THIS happens ppl tht dont get shot. guy made fun vaccine gravy. There's difference intellectual moron. Oddly specific amount. reason exactly $14,650? classic “masks don’t protect you.” fuck don’t! might case old sock fashioned face covering last April, lot us decided get good gear since then.

So many people stopped processing new information last June so, it’s impossible talk virus without hearing essentially bunch folklore droplets kids can’t get sick bullshit everyone know isn’t true now. something prevent that. way getting peoples’ immune system react virus fight effectively. yet, 40+ right now. Younger get vaccinated meet certain criteria, health worker family member one, etc. country constrained amount Pfizer ordered, means rollout slow. 

The government caught short putting eggs AstraZenica basket due clotting issue, vaccine advisory group recommended 60s only. 

That said, given recent outbreak, opened AstraZeneca via GPs 40s cohort want wait main rollout receive Pfizer. make AZ shore, messaging good, expect uptake great.  Arguably, long enough timeline, problem either take care (in die off) virus thrive unvaccinated populations. Dude, loss smell far scariest part me. I’ve colds flus; I’ve never sickness everything seemed flowing needed (sinus-wise) just… stopped smelling stuff. discovered shower three days wife came home positive Covid test. Suddenly soap shampoo didn’t smell. Straight bleach didn’t smell. Vinegar, coffee, fabuloso… smell. like weeks, weeks fatigue symptoms gone. weeks wondered environment actually clean, couldn’t smell dirty. 

It messes you. wonder, actually smelling thing, thing powerful-smelling I’m picking it? think made kind conscious decision vaccinate people, think lot logistical issues program, apparently lot people waiting certain brand vaccine available.

By way, perfectly fine take many different measures simultaneously! less lethal forms.

I've never understood 'mutate less lethal forms' part. selection pressure would make happen? sick silly excuse wear mask. coronavirus new. CDC gave best information time. revised learned more. Lots things revised lives: people used able smoke hospitals airplanes; cars seatbelts. information gathered things recommendations changed. Like another person thread already said: excuse people want wear masks.   Get vaccine last summer Southern Hemisphere. hostile intolerant post read today. 

I'm saying. first line abstract bad, consequently vague, English. proper intellectual need one? ""So saying I'm indestructible""  I’ve putting getting vaccinated mostly stay inside right now, gonna get first dose Wednesday mother concerned Covid might bad reaction might back January uncle sick time, taste smell lost though maybe not. wants get tested antibodies first don’t wanna delay first dose. science say people already Covid? miss bit elderly vulnerable vaccinated, fact prioritised? Hahahaha sure hope child medically able receive vaccine becomes available! big variants first identified laissez-faire countries like Brazil, others popped middle heavy restrictions -- Delta spreading, India getting great press controlling pandemic masks. 

How variants arise, even arise (as opposed identified) hard know. new mutation may take one immunocompromised person can't clear virus.

What really comes virus mutating long exists, forever. ITT multiple posts folks vaccinated contracted virus got symptoms--i understand vaccine mean immune, I'm interested general behaviors are. folks go back ""regular"" life line pandemic? many continuing wear masks social distance vaccination also got sick? Mate I'm Australia. currently lockdown stricter US ever can't get cases 100. There's 0 chance ended US without vaccinations rest infected I'm totally help, want private message that's fine too! Guess going ignore rising cases too. internal thesaurus comment reminded former biology teacher mine figured teach evolution Bible belt: avoided saying name ""Darwin"" substituted word ""evolution"" ""species change time"" magically interruptions anti evolution protesters stopped. seems weird idea political leadership kinds things turn dime. 

Masks on! Masks off! People city one set rules, people another city different set! Beginning July 28th, switch completely different set rules! something gets certain level, declare condition blue!

I think world works like this. dealing large diverse masses people, establish simple rules keep long time. people pretty disconnected what's going top, really care. frank, loss taste smell brain damage. People still get Delta, later variants top 5.

Very sorry! godsend, Delta's transmission absolute BEAST compared Alpha. (UK) month throughout country, getting high levels antibodies - vaccinations infections. 

It multiplies 200% faster Alpha catch whole communities unawares. [Keep eyes, Yep needed read today. Thank you. sure stop obsessing, guess take sign try. 

I think it’s hard pivot spending year avoiding covid, everything could “slow spread” avoid virus. WFH year got vaccinated soon eligible learn likely us long time. think also like think “in know” semblance control situation completely control. yeah, obsessing thread adding value life. work already is. personally issue continuing wear mask keep safe. Covid scare week got tested. Fortunately negative, started going back gym full unmasked people worried got sick. Going continue wearing mask safety. Let Anti-vaxxers infect other. aware reddit highly astroturfed   fully vaccinated since May. still wear mask indoors. trust anyone without mask on. No. refuse easiest thing anyone ever asked save life ""I gEt SaD CaN't SeE sTrAnGeR's FaCe'S."" Imagine propogating plague weak go three fucking months god damn piece cloth face massive fucking baby. vaccinated, far I'm concerned today

Dear lord dude, major trigger sentence around parts :) many threads literally this.  Based what? 

A basic understanding physics? good explanation minute physics.

The larger viral loads affect particle sizes. cloth mask still stop droplets (protecting others), stop particles (important protecting aerosols already Delta produces 1000x higher viral loads, infectious person exhaling much virally-dense emissions every breath.

Yes, masks less effective. (But still better nothing).  Anti-vaxxers, government done bad job past months.

Short vaccine mandate, doubt Supreme Court would even allow, way get half country vaccinate themselves. patently false stop giving terrible uninformed advice-

Counter examples come immediately mind:

State government
Federal Government

Any employee employment contact whose terms differ stated 

As easy categories begin with. That’s point. Blame young people rather older people decided get vaccine Vaccines available children 12. That's keep wearing mask. family vaccinated 9 year old not. seems like basically gave definition ""selfish"" said can't call people selfish get call people ""selfish"" wanting live **their** lives **they** always have.

The actual definition selfish consideration others; concerned chiefly **one's own** personal profit pleasure.

I mean, way wanting live *your* life way *you* want without taking might affect others account (""what business"") straight definition selfish?

Whether selfish, can't say. stated pretty clearly selfish. saying get call someone selfish saying want whatever want despite affects anyone else. exactly *can* call someone selfish for?   Convince comes Latin *con-* meaning *with*, *-vincere* meaning *conquer*. agree, conquer fucks let's move on. sad sack accidental meat would crawl corner rot, world would better place. like realized could sued causing deaths happened SA variant? Yup. 
Those burnouts watched far much V Vendetta.  Still waiting fda approval believe Yea that’s confuses sub. Everyone shitting states like Florida Missouri (and get ton flack vaccine numbers) it’s open everywhere

I’ve Philly, New York, LA past month. 3 super blue areas. Life exactly like pre pandemic 

The vast majority people completely Covid whether they’re vaccinated not. think places like sub small bubble representative vaccinated people, let alone population large savage I’m it.   people forgetting kids exist mRNA vaccine technology around decade though, used actual vaccines. lot people nursing homes symptom free. Also, Florida months prepare, NY not. testing, PPE, help federal government CDC, etc. two situations comparable. Great, Florida already really stupid Enjoy 69th award! 

Nice. 7 children delta ICU one town.

Covid 19 kids-are-carriers.

Delta might kids-in-caskets.

We data.  wear condoms...  So, don’t get he’s saying. Maybe try re-reading try understand point he’s making instead weirdly confrontational. 

Your husband could child Fauci Einstein doesn’t help can’t comprehend read.  masks work well protect others.

Based what? Delta produces 1000x higher viral loads, infectious person exhaling much virally-dense emissions every breath. Gotcha. Yeah, wife bummed could saved money whole time, way knowing California going that. could afford rent even losing job it. There’s reason look back upset, what’s done done. Yes. it’s specifically excluded, generalized willful stupidity protected preexisting condition can’t penalized.  Seriously churches way bougie lookin. thought assholes supposed ""humble""  I’m 30s first shot December 2020. Fortunate healthcare worker. Many like vaccinated early due line work.  wouldn’t call lockdowns draconian though. really like figure republicans got pinned blame**, certainly believed start breaking state data county level overlay voting demographic trends picture becomes clear. older and/ whiter county (GOP base), higher vaccination rates go.

Wishful thinking, confirmation bias echo chamber effect.

Some people (for example, majority reddit's prolific users, main target demographics certain broadcasters) *want* believe blame r\*publicans everything, pay attention information confirms idea ignore information doesn't. lots people think way congregate place, create version reality support other's beliefs, giving feeling right, everyone talk tells so.

Conversely, demographic wants blame r\*publicans everything also tends reluctant say anything bad anyone who's white, revel stories r\*publicans refusing vaccination, they'll avoid talking black people thing, make excuses (these excuses often display lot paternalistic racism show see black people lacking ability make minds take responsibility decisions). Professor Whatsit comes badly here. Posting study conclusions front center, emphasizing findings multi-part tweet, critique, saying ""it's say showing - study authors say showing."". Uh. amplified this. language used tweets makes appear share authors' opinion. Yep cases merchants claim 'essential oils' product infused orange/lemongrass/line mysterious drugs combat covid 19 effectively boost sales without scientific evidence behind it. aims punish group people. low voice, softer one. wear mask people legitimately can't hear muffled can't read lips. makes worse referee, kids running court, much noise reading lips essential job. Well, that's they're *saying*. assume wrong.

But seven people got hit hard, seven vaxed. know others.

All actually prevent severe Covid, latest numbers showing actually prevent percentage severe cases claimed. That's going hospitalization numbers among fully

None effective HIV treatments say patient's life pretty much normal suppressive therapy. mean infer treatments, meant breakthroughs like HIV cocktails.

Hey Jpop, husband geneticist.

I pretending anything. OP mention reason kids go hospitals.
This covid sub, cancer, diabetes, asthma, etc etc true, sadly. 
The happened Brazil. need to. would public awareness campaign encouraging people lose weight survive Covid. personally calling fat people. great point. Literally can’t charge different prices HIV+ individuals, despite economics. People understand water likely believe wet word downturn typically used comparing cases today vs. past cases area. comparing UK cases Uttar Pradesh cases isn’t doesn’t prove downturn UK fucking supposed unfair. guy’s annoyed everything right found that, certain ways, benefit people who, whatever reason, did. feel way, regards paying rent laid pandemic. pandemic vaccines ability rent intertwined. LOL thoughts exactly. Like summer's amazing, everyone know vaccinated I've hanging them! pfizer stored regular refrigeration temps like 4-6 weeks believe. could done. like freeda-be-dumb arnt enough prisoners us.    Isn’t we’re doing, nations   Yes Unfortunate can't expect people live restrictions forever protect you, need altar habits. Yeah, I’m convinced mask mandates effective. 

Wearing masks correctly effective preventing outward spread, wearing N95 mask correctly effective reducing chance infective. 

But people wear masks correctly don’t need forced so. 

And people don’t won’t wear masks correctly aren’t going start mandate. problem they're obviously not. care about, hospitalizations serious cases cases? talk new guidelines based latter original restrictions based former. free market means lmao Let's hope not! know case medical doctor's note. Hopefully government able that! know probably risk much everything lot stable. health somehow infect someone without knowing!  Yep. Turn baseball game, stadiums packed, even bad teams. Bars, restaurants booming, traffic bad again. Cases maybe rise look around, majority population care better worse. Mask mandates still table country. CDC *might* recommend them, majority states going reimplement actually want get pandemic,

Its least decade two get pandemic(assuming get sort anti-viral). Covid spread vaccinated people survive several mammal species. going anywhere.  Well geez, I'm sorry, mine joke. Cause farts stink harmless besides offensive nose. 8% Democrats vs. 49% Republicans.

We place blame accordingly.  Food Drug Administration plans allow 10 million doses distributed United States sent countries, warning *regulators cannot guarantee Emergent BioSolutions, company operates plant, followed good manufacturing practices.*

I trust Bolsonaro's health minister would care good manufacturing practices  I’m sure reopening nothing governor’s recall.  Sounds like rehash March 2020- “maybe COVID effects Asian people” It’s soon relax. second Covid shot coming still wear mask stay away people. I’m saying people live constant fear people really stupid. guess endure alone time people. child paid off. unvaccinated may die sacrifice I’m willing make.

We must move on. I’m garbage. masks me. said 50% fully vaxxed. 16% partially Shut Fox News 14-yr-old niece hesitant get vaccine. reactions teens getting this? hope wearing N95 come contact others. fully vaccinated, risk group, there's low chance firstly getting Covid, showing symptoms hospitalized. 

If worried testing positive isolate, that's far higher likelihood again, double vaccinated, COVID functionally flu (if less dangerous) intellect spring olfactory senses. are. They’re telling everyone get ready vaccinated Sept 1st. That’s really ramp internal mass vaccinations well. Appreciate that, see cardiology says vax age group. Holding hope vaccine works &lt;3 Looks like reply got automodded, hope user got banned spreading dangerous misinformation. Looking vaccinations vs countries likes Australia paints different story. no, China’s impact much higher US. US looking 2 years unprecedented growth. 

The fact need explain need permanent closure large swaths economy suggest folks made segments. saying “deal it” means know suggestions unreasonable. 

If honestly think sufficiently vaccinated population unable resume normal economy need explain why. Exactly thought. comes across like angry parent punishing children sneaking grounded. 1. true, completely ignores point implications long haul COVID. 
2. Also way less likely. vaccinated people less likely spread. know eradicated polio people vaccinated measles, etc there’s almost community spread. 
3. vaccinated increase odds deadly version. You’re increasing risk everyone. yourself. 

Your refusal take vaccine wildly selfish, short-sighted, anti-scientific, arrogant decision potentially get people killed. really propaganda? 

Yeah, really. Propaganda supposed misleading, biased. Calling ""pandemic unvaccinated"" simple fact numbers, blaming totally reasonable. unvaccinated way choice (yeah know, people medically can't get vaccine - microscopic percentage compared number unvaccinated). like 6 months get shot. vaccinated, literally chose catch covid. Best luck ventilator. I'm going keep living life I'm dumbass. COMPLETELY absurd expect people continue sacrificing months years lives ""pandemic mode"" protect people refuse protect themselves. NYT tracker must date.  badly government handled covid really reminds aids epidemic tbh ways. Marginalized people effected, people group (nondisabled) can't fathom becoming disabled even cognizant fear them.  true   country young people vaccinated elderly. Besides practically anti-vaxxers Spain   vaccine highly effective preventing death icu level disease. definitely still possible get hopefully effects much much less. hope gets well soon. positive rates backdated week. We'll see ones days cases dropping next couple days.  also varies country instances higher 3%. That's fuck ton bodies. Beta. nearly transmissible Alpha (but worse immune evasion) could compete it, mostly disappeared, way Alpha going Delta. mean... certain races definitely worse outcomes. would say socioeconomic thing, reddit hates hear real problem economic things get specific races.  Hang on, man, come soon. Everyday one day less wait antivaxer.

The way people like talk hesitant towards vaccines going make literally 0 decide get vaccinated. hand, many people fence would get discouraged start associating vaccinations smug, hateful people.

In short, actions make people less likely get vaccinated. antivaxer. right; lifted while, amongst restrictions lifted recently include mandatory mask wearing places and, mentioned, nightclubs, pretty substantial restrictions doubt played large role preventing case numbers.  Sunken cost fallacy. ONS antibody estimates basically gold standard random sampling unlike Manaus study. 92% rather narrow CIs would assume malnutrition poverty, maybe genetic. I’m spitballing here. Leave people alone let live lives. 

This virus made many people insufferable. 1) chance dying COVID extremely small healthy people without pre-existing conditions.

2) people still catch virus vaccinated people well.

3) already ton variants none seem deadly/dangerous original virus. thing exist part World it’s going away, personally begin take yearly shot something likely won’t kill anyway. get mine Ebay they've always authentic, buy good seller. Right 10 cup style n95s $9.95 free shipping. They're NIOSH approved well. wrong. different threshold risk wants invite family over. fully vaccinated person mRNA vaccine likely contract delta variant? I’m going UK US days I’m extra cautious, I’m worried flight. likely contract virus test positive? Went carefree early. sates would trouble reaching 70% ones care world fundamentally broken. already starting get bit shorter. Fall around corner.

🥳 ""let get sick"". ""let Virus mutate Virus get sick"" Mask orders never lifted imo sure you’re downvoted. guarantee we’ll back restrictions sometime next weeks. Enjoy normal life still can. Nope. Nu variant, Sigma variant, iteration. won’t get zero Covid, sounds like don’t believe vaccines work.   think that's bit reductive. Although true large percentage population never got page masks, make whole population, even it. People going house parties theater shows last year part simply already type people never masks never going be.  

I personally could clearly recognize cultural shift toward masking point last year. became case wearing mask, odd man out, weirdo, one people giving dirty looks. many videos see last year someone would store business somewhere, patrons telling put damn mask on, flagging employees/manager tell person gtfo. took months get point, eventually got there. That'd really help out. get enough omega 3s I’m obviously implying waiting pandemic scientific standpoint. getting point return essentially normal because, despite country largely reopened, aren’t yet. many unvaccinated individuals remaining country we’ve hit wall. Something gotta give we’re actually making negative progress again. that’s people want hear ignore thought pandemic over.

This really crux it. CDC never said pandemic risk zero people vaccinated. People heard wanted hear blaming CDC misunderstanding. Remember told wash hands singing happy birthday start? People’s hands dry bleeding theater. effort could put masking social distancing. Sigh. know immune responses vary ethnic backgrounds? viruses certain ethnicities impacted others. it’s realm possibility even clearly try say  CDC lost credibility said vaccinated people need masks.  Virus mutates. Maybe vaccinated people need masks current covid still mask mutations check.  Same. work grocery store. vaccinated, taking chances considering live farm country. want go Distant Worlds concerts. haven’t checked maybe touring again. I’m really concert junkie love orchestrated game music. Covid preventing enjoying it. Ren Faire (at least SoCal). I’m sure it’ll back next year. Maybe something like Tamiflu H5N1, god’s sake. think i’ve read something like study, it’s testing phase still… reading correctly Rahm positive month ago? Hence word ""could"".  Yeah hope people realize ""very low risk death"" ""very low risk"" 

This mean run kids without care. Covid bastard even though almost certainly die kids risk pretty nasty suffering.  

Data plural anecdote, nephew might juuust getting what's effectively 5 months bronchitis Covid. Almost half damn year sick point wheezing going stairs. 9 years old. 

You want kids getting disease. internet media like Bell Curve.
The loudest voices ends get amplified people middle.

You're right though. travel work besides airport kids events everything normal. believe boosted people's moods. took videos last year bad place least 6 months. feel great.
I'm anti-masker, wear cause want person viral video. like it. restricts breathing, turns us ""robots"" lack better term. Psychology difficult. Combine restrictions 1 thing, crush small businesses, horrible way live.
Covid effects lot people, many died sucks. realistic. majority mild symptoms fine. CFR US 1.8% mostly elderly vaccines. One directors double jabbed Covid, quite badly 3-4 days fine back work middle last week. 

He keeps stating can’t remember words says words doesn’t mean. Mother’s carer phone whilst work day, instead saying goodbye said ‘love you’.

I thought nothing asked ‘did say love you?, carer fuck.’

Apparently he’s done several times since Client keeps forgetting simple words.

He keeps blaming Covid fair it’s completely character. It’s going around. whole house last week. What’s stupid letting disease ravage population excuse endemic. It’s already obvious countries took early, consequential action suppress disease come ahead. China’s handling pandemic compared US’s rolling shitshow already accelerated pace overtake US economy they’ve seen highest GDP growth rebound since started tracking it. COVID continue economic disaster US precisely refuse take consequential action stop disease. stick tube loosen hurts less  guess we'll see surge schools starting require around October. know parents willing home school lack masks way around, that's going hurt funding, much decided per student It’s revisionist genuinely you’d think things would play out, roughly correct.

Reinstating mask mandate since hospitalizations spiraling control, prior aware would outcome, demonstrates decision plainly wrong one make. It’s understandable made, wrong. Many people moderate worse side effects first shot come back. vaccine infection immune get. immune, followed vaccinated people infected, people infected vaccinated, people get walloped Delta variant. How’s view top hill?  Goodness truly well said! shame much American public become spoiled brats. mean come on! Every little inconvienience made way bigger ever appease morons insane grown people behave manner. Whoever take proper measures fault people need held responsible well. encourage try But, got dip magic pool told God forgave something even do, someone else die take away bad stuff did. Clearly, can't wrong.  Fine people thousand dollars day vaccinated. Take directly bank accounts. close accounts, garnish wages. year ago pro mask I’ve anti mask since got second dose April. benefit sooo marginal won’t comply time  countries high levels vaccination. totally see still happening Australia though outbreaks. god.

I app called Newsbreak. interesting read comments people make. honestly wonder tons Russian disinformation spreaders...

Every story dealing vaccine depta variant Fauci filled hatred virtriol. Calling vaccine poison. Covid19 still ""just flu"". Everyone apparently never got sick (so trust test dont believe numbers 🤦‍♂️). sure point.

People going keep dying disguisting.  larger viral loads affect particle sizes. cloth mask still stop droplets (protecting others), stop particles (important protecting aerosols already air).

You're misunderstanding something here. **more** particles every breath, escape mask's barrier amount time, escape gaps unsealed/unfitted masks basically everyone wears.    endless conversation since COVID started. answer no. virus human virus effects ethnicities human virus unfortunately know mom Parkinson’s loss sense smell prodromal symptom often precedes motor symptoms decade more. first read covid causing anosmia toward beginning pandemic said NOPE tried hard avoid infected — far successfully. concerned going see increasing rates Parkinson’s/Parkinsonism result pandemic, seen articles wherein neurologists quoted raising concern. COVID cases still high due variants, hospitals getting overrun way fewer deaths. NY, despite 20 million people it, something like 2 COVID deaths today, that's low, uncertain whether COVID could even considered cause. 

The whole point lockdown eradicate virus, relieve pressure hospitals people turned away, resulting unnecessary deaths ass got vaccinated NFL stadium dont even work FFS. hope daily fine. Thank thank anyone still masking. I've explain family can't see unmasked, get either. understood covid, newborns let hold ineligible whooping cough vaccination too. get everyone's tired pandemic, delta anti-vaxxers, we're woods. 

I've never felt grateful adaptable people.   Home Depot, Uline, Grainger probably Aerosol droplets infected individual remain air hours, especially so-so ventilation worse. Imagine someone front restaurant bar start smoking.  sitting close enough could smell smoke cigarette, close enough contact aerosol droplets person breathing talking loudly. 


 I've worked labs required wear PPE times. reason removed mask, immediately move emergency decon, put mask dealing chemicals thousands times larger virus.  

If worried possible infection, ""safe"" period time sitting restaurant bar, especially variant far contagious. notice strong trend age groups, regardless age ~2x higher chance infection got shot early (1.6x &lt;39). two thirds population estimated antibodies India natural immunity mainly. know assumed natural immunity strong vaccines -- think jury still Considering approximately zero people UK given that, think good mate? Science isn’t belief system. need review data determine conclusion supportable. article, study uses really small sample size, I’m sure statistically significant is. Also, study period? studies done delta variant dominant strain.  young person got early much likely underlying condition though someone wants everyone else put lives hold order comfort irrational anxiety? think that's pretty selfish.

This whataboutism. Two things selfish time. 

The difference, however, COVID context, would anxious person views *real* threat *and* *and* others, they're actually trying protect *everyone*, themselves. view irrational — them, they're asking others something rational saying ""please drive drunk endanger me,"" really think anyone would classify selfish request. 

In short, even grant anxious person irrational, difference anxious person making requests real *perceived* threat others, person follow requests purely self-interest disregard fear discomfort may stir anxious person. That's different someone follow requests effort give degree exposure therapy. action selfish depending motivation is. 

Either way, I'm arguing specific situation here. I'm saying specific wording used, abstracted specific circumstances, basically definition selfish. Whether wearing wearing mask selfish depends lot different factors, something purely self-interest, described, always inherently selfish. Vaccination could exit, rates like anywhere else world, won’t be. Lol. Posts link saying vaccines effective. Link states vaccines largely prevent severe illness death. confrontational politely explaining.

You politely anything. rude, dismissive comments show follow people argue.

I follow people? What?  know Maryland October. I’ll probably go one visit parents. eventually tested positive COVID takes extra day two sometimes.

Also wondering it’s vicious cycle service industry. don’t work don’t get paid can’t afford rent. want covid stop real government rent relief would need place jobs sick days.. assume wear mask you’re eating/drinking put back you’re done? That’s best    Long covid fad. complicated, multifaceted set issues psychosomatic reactions mild prevailing symptoms debilitating disability deserves respect understanding. local public health departments access info? Abusive how? youngest immunocompromised. desire continue indefinitely, now, it’s best decision family. It’s also we’re moving state. 

Allowing child get covid would much abusive teaching home maintaining outdoor play dates visiting family safely. Remember Shawn Dead? mum hid want worry I’m still wearing mask everywhere… FLORIDA places. know it’s big difference, one person (actually whole family 5 people) don’t even mind them. Kind gotten used I’m honest got back vacation, poppin there.  Sydney Australia vaccinating 30 year olds? don’t much vaccine coverage yet I’d pretty surprised option. Yes, read article. ""Passage time"" could imply waning immunity, opportunities exposure, both, thus question. article seems suggest waning immunity mechanism efficacy reduction, without considering potential exposure due voluntary self-shielding people vaccination. Sorry, no. I'm postponing life protect anti-vaxxers second longer, especially would gleefully step dead body stick gum. Yeah, person replied seems talking U.S. thoughts. bring back masks, can't see ever going away again. Even 80-90 won’t enough that’s assuming vaccine stays effective it’s clear variant knocks chunk efficacy. You’re going need 80-90% get fully vaccinated commit boosters every 6-12 months Thomas Jefferson said “The tree liberty must refreshed time time blood patriots tyrants” Anyone DC area guess restrictions reimplemented there? I'm currently FL (what restrictions?) I'm starting new job DC October, they're telling us plan city person despite fact office fully open yet. delta exploding kinda doubt comes fruition, coming time sign lease really want pay much higher rent we're going remote anyways. I'm fully vaxxed barring passport idk matter all. Unfortunately lot smart people politicians don’t realize dumb population is. 

They’ve spent nearly entire lives surrounded intelligent people people similar opinions. causes believe others similar sane. 

Repubs realize though. think there’s perpetual intellectual decline party message lol Bad bot, shut Yeah kind figured customer insisted try. We'll billing customer time. Sorry didn’t translate well 😂 Yeah. said another comment nothing actual season is... even without covid Florida rampage, high schooler NJROTC 7am definitely second summer seeming like summer, aside heat, rain hurricanes. need vacation vacation state, covid state... homeschooled son kindergarten year safety. special needs- autism, severe ADHD, OCD speech issues. hard homeschool little attention span feel like able read gone public school. able pick curriculum perfect one public schools use. rewarding regard. Still tough though!  confrontational politely explaining.

okey doke 

Your comments show follow people argue. 

So that.  Billions people around world still unvaccinated Delta need much help general stupidity ignorance

So two resources US abundance of...  Yeah went sub every place turned turned away  ""The sun bright"" Well feel completely stupid here. I'm debating 1 month old Reddit account lol. Welcome block list lol. God feel stupid engaging account.

Edit: Look comments, nothing spreading FUD new restrictions implemented quell surge we're now. agenda here? sources care individually wrapped?  $660,000 minimum salary. Sadly true. 1. actually probably 4,5 mil deaths this. number almost certainly undercount many places able provide accurate total unwilling. Furthermore, someone old and/or sick mean life somehow less important less meaningful less worth protecting. addition, ages people hospitalized and/or dying COVID younger dying earlier strains. fact age band highest rates infection 15-45. places reporting median age new infections 35. rate death climbing yet, change infectious delta variant pushes people hospitals less access care people need things like oxygen meds. yeah, data this, valid data supports argument. again, okay someone 50 die COVID? 
2. never reach 100% vaccination mean attempt to. know can't reach 100% people able get vaccine due age pre-existing condition, reason herd immunity works enough people get vaccine do, protects vulnerable.
3. That's literally diseases work. disease spreads community, chance mutate mutation possibility making transmissible, deadly, etc. That's diseases do. That's entire study microbiology virology. needs new flu vaccine every year mutates changes.

Finally, vaccines approved. tested. They've proven effective, side effects. reason vaccines take longer come reasons: 
1. Lack money 
2. Lack manpower 
3. Competing interests 


In cases above, they've non-issue COVID global pandemic focus world, resources many governments backing up. scientific all-hands-on-deck moment government agencies private businesses scientific institutes universities pitched work get vaccines like way stop spread end pandemic.  


Again, saying going take even though science clear everyone needs get vaccinated keep world safe selfish decision part, puts peoples lives risk. that's want be, want selfish tell bunch crap justify poor decision making process, that's prerogative, second think actions affect you. don't. decision vaccinated affects community too. happens get sick suffer consequences. Even pays. long-term health care everything goes paid nation live in, asking everyone pay poor rationale get vaccine. Never mind people could infect well. Everything unverified verified.

Lots side effects covid anecdotal years enough study done. Hell, long covid symptom that’s studied far started anecdotal experiences.

Doesn’t mean take gospel anything- like anything else, take anecdotal experience. Maybe it’s completely base even lie, maybe it’s rare symptom someone dealing with. Mandatory vaccinations schools, workplaces, etc. Lots places already diseases (you get MMR go school many states) starting COVID. I’m vaccinated point, everyone doesn’t vaccine fuck ‘em. knew risk took chances. Im going back lockdowns mask mandates. recall story Hancock hired lover public government salary too. Oh arrows even grocery store staff ignored? wear chin diapers diluted state, revised requirement allows 1 month. feds planned rollout, requirement allowed 5 days.

In undiluted state, Pfizer still needs -80ºC -60ºC. Yeah think much happen this. Fauci director CDC buck stops Biden, probably knows politically tenable took wear better mask longer trust people make good decision. people taking mask vacinated. people dont want others think unvaccinated. antimaskers. go see. many variables tiny brain back n/kn95 public.  Nice. means give wife Covid pinkeye time.  studies people infected vaccine increases count spike specific antibodies also antibodies parts virus, immunity robust. I'm referring lucky live country got access vaccine first. I'm implying vaccine lottery US won. thing pisses masks mandated, it’ll people wearing vaccinated wore before. unvaccinated won’t, masks become part lifestyle due idiots won’t care themselves. 

I’ll wear required, make resentful others won’t get vaccinated wear mask. 

I grateful care aren’t idiots. one moron brother, he’s always moron. order this, you’d need create national vaccination database, done yet, trivial create. essentially “carrot” version vaccine passport. Maybe could pass congress, it’d take quite time actually happen. Definitely able done projected Delta peak fall.   you’re saying perfectly reasonable you’re downvoted again. 🙄 think people US convinced months ago-especially they’re vaccinated-and don’t want hear anything contrary, even happens true. 

And anyway one saying go live cave. dig damn masks mothballs put back on. really isn’t serious. (Except people clearly is.)  That’s great news! think sub invaded bunch trolls lately. lot accounts new posting anti mask rhetoric. sure point trying make now... think projections took Delta’s transmissibility account. That’s Oct drops dramatically, opposed last winter sort constant giant effective that's policy time employees customers enter throughout time leave.

It's pointless Wear mask table take start eating drinking.

The truly effective measures bar restaurant reduced capacity shutting permanently. Masks never effective environment eating drinking involved. normalizing masks the, well, norm? thanks.

I think risk happening regardless much effort could potentially put encouraging use masks pandemic. Same. I've clubbing PACKED places FL know lot people vaccinated probably walking around sick. got second moderna late April gotten sick all, unvaccinated people know catching like crazy fraction exposure had. Indeed advocate watching data closely determine measures necessary.  Didn’t realize schools dictated season year is

I kid  bad news delta infects spreads among children pretty well. Vaccinated people still spread virus smaller chance due less viral load. Also kids vaccinated helping keep safer important. think that'd like saying individual pixels monochromtic blue square make blue, blue. think. need sleep. much data delta variant, long term effects. sensible scenario seems everyone stay masked age 6 months+ vaccinated. &lt; 6 months get antibodies mother's breastmilk. ""Covid measures"" creeping simply stupid/selfish flexing ignorance/selfishness?  Good luck getting vaccine, believe regret it! We’re still reusing n95s hospital. It’s better, we’re definitely back single use like they’re supposed be.

Also, doubt general public getting fit tested whatever mask they’re wearing. I’ve seen plenty people wearing n95/kn95s facial hair example. you’re getting tight seal, you’re much better wearing regular surgical mask. point recommending wearing straining supply lines won’t wear properly anyways transmission greatly reduced vaccines regular mask mandates. course, larger gap, likely people don’t get dose two. It’s one things folks public health balance. Pure science versus people’s participation compliance  saying wearing condom better wearing one. AIDs still gonna spread even everyone wears one. Oh been. statewide comments full people talking they're going vote now, realistically runs ***R*** next name she'll win. refused even debate anybody, reason ran last time recently disgraced governor bowed Lt. Gov. go Hobby Covid Lobby Easy peasy- government tracking vaccinated. went FEMA sight soldiers administer injections. texted appointment info second dose. (That bizarre experience btw) register vote. Safe say it’s easy run numbers. Pfizer. doctor told wait don’t antibodies consider vaccine made sense it’s still scary. also GBS tetanus shot younger.  can’t ask questions 🙃 here.  stunt. Everything heard, even right left sides fence. situations public safety, mask mandates within rights local, state governments enforce. Pfizer, Pfizer Moderna similar JnJ completely unavailable. also looks like according trial data theres benefit getting vaccinated confirmed case place extra vaccines danger wasted offering third shots way use course aren’t. I’m expecting Missouri start falling line new stance low vaccination republican states get people vaccinated. Although love stats, it’s heavily skewed vaccines weren’t widespread recently. better calculation would June July numbers vaxxed/unvaxxed difference, however, COVID context, would anxious person views real threat others, they're actually trying protect everyone, themselves

And I'm terrified terrorist attacks demand everyone getting plane needs strip searched increase security? agree increased security would probably reduce terrorist attacks tiny amount, technically everyone flying would tiny bit ""safer"". cost flying public willing pay. 

The person demanding everyone else bow wishes selfish. person wants get plane without strip searched ""selfish"". want live damn life, every right do.

What decide everyone US forced wear body camera transmits live streams police HQ 24/7? think reduce crime make everyone safer. everyone thinks that's bad idea ""selfish fucks care thousands people victims crime every year""? docked pay week work would insignificant you?

I’m arguing fines egregious (I think also higher), say weeks worth pre-tax salary insignificant misleading. Ironically one first ones wearing mask block wildfire smoke. definitely changed stance. wouldn’t surprised unvaccinated Alabama surprised sudden disappointment them. vaccines 90% effective get mild moderate symptoms. Also hospitals US? seen nothing high covid patients , vaccinated admited covid. reports long covid people getting covid vaccination?  risk kiddos

I’m glad you’re prioritizing safety kids, COVID pose substantial risk healthy... That's right. I'm wearing mask either. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I receive: Vaccine

Fauci receives: Shut f*** up. you’re able vaccinated haven’t been, don’t care happens you. obviously drain society. writing wall, US gonna new mask mandate soon (possibly excluding anti-lockdown state holdouts), it’ll stay way till least next March. 14,650 600,000 significant amount, that's average players salary. include delta? July 19th include significant portion delta Except Australia economic support workers can't work. more, especially time around always workers fall cracks eligible primarily people protesting here. mainly people anti vax, people hold conspiracy theories covid real kind attempt total population control etc.

Supporting people can't work financially held many governments (state federal gov ideologically welfare much get away with) #1 way control virus high enough vaccination rates yet. state people even access financial support able stay home work wait covid test results can't access sick leave.

The states Australia locked quickly hard short lockdowns comparison Sydney listed business interests far long locking down. economy going tanked rest country. already. Schools start week two many places. Cold Flu season far behind.

Do really need influx sick people wondering cold, flu, Covid packing doctors RS offices emergency rooms next months.  Stupidity consequences. want data supplements end papers There's ulterior agenda. People fed goal posts moved. promised normal life vaccines govt can't figure deal idiots, pay it? way.  Less 400 75 million people age 18. practically none. problem is…many folks aren’t able stay home. Or, to, screwed financially. :( Yup. Stupid people trained respond keywords, ever understand concept behind words, change words fine one case. get COVID you’re 17, odds overwhelming you’ll survive. Booster shots cant come soon enough. former neighbor friends got covid back could get vaccine. ended psychotic episodes screaming kids trying kill her. gotten better one scariest side effects I've ever heard of. Yeah, blood clots losing limbs horrible losing mind point think family trying kill terrifies me. would worried every day symptoms could come back time. zinc harmful? Every republican fights preventative measures virus charged multiple counts criminal negligence. Common people. Read source article article. title 100% false. linked NFL fine unvaccinated players $14,650 violate COVID-19 protocols season, ESPN reports.

Now espn article spotlight put punishment report Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians would fine player ""$14,000 spot every time wearing mask breaking protocol.""

The $14K fine players breaking covid protocol. Vaccinated not. last year. isnt nothing new. thing changes vaccinated players theres team outbreak exposed dont 5 day quarantine like players.

All all. title been. ""NFL continue fine players break covid protocols""

Done. Blades don’t need reloaded. 
Sir Lobo seeing much action. Covid back October lost sense smell taste, mostly food still tastes bland me. hard find food enjoy eating mostly eat i'm hungry  I'm wearing mask. got vaccinated. part. give crap Fauci says. call cops me. I'm wearing again. Enough enough. like times get pain side keep telling pulled muscle even though body screaming you. Go work. Come home. Cook, clean, finally make Doctor appointment.....and full blown cancer. NFLPA pushed vaccinations optional

it doesn’t make better, that’s Willfully ignorant grown ass adults. I’d never penalize sick child parents fucking morons.  I'm scientist feasible vaccinated person inhale exhale viral particles, thus need mask? tried explain Mom thinks vaccine like nukes viral particles soon breathe in. Replied comment, trip going solo. way hell I’m solo traveling Covid hotbed risk getting sick alone trip hotels. suggest hitting eastern parks, got back lake compounce, six flags New England, Hershey, knoebels, bgw, etc. assume coaster enthusiast lol Second this...this reminds antibodies way body fight infection. fully vaxxed since March. worth sore arms times lol. used Singapore Math first time year teacher. favorite curriculum, job done. Almost month later. May ask played out? joke doesn’t get old mega! wondered kind tests doing. And, yes, would show positive while. Thanks! resident population high rate vaccinated residents, do, high number positive test rates breakthrough infections, logical conclusion I’m drawing unless folks vaccinated get inoculated, go back precautionary mask wearing…it’s possible become cyclical.

There seems among township belief folks visiting aren’t fully vaccinated…which likely correct.

The fortunate aspect vaccinated largely able avoid hospitalization death.
The unfortunate aspect may maxed number people going get vaccine.

:-( Thank you. Fuck people. that's fatality rate mate I’m sick stories. “He didn’t believe virus. he’s dead. Celebration 11.” get hit fine multiple times though, 16 game season, 16 × $14,650 = $234,400. taxes, taking around half salary home

$330k, cry river know, living expenses (mortgage, etc) beyond becomes prohibitive same! going hit six flags, wof, silver dollar city august 7. Cancelled trip even though vaccinated. Thank you, nabbed some! I've got healthy supply KN95s well hurt ton point, unfortunately.   suggesting greatest fear, inevitable outcome. sad way really incentivize people death. 25% mortality rate, everyone know someone several people died. likely change people's minds. hope get point, 50% US population could care less now, outcome could face? mean 2% like weeks worth pay. would call significant amount. Tbf, adjusting Patrick Mahomes' vaccinations, removing doses received, heavily regresses around immunity levels unvaccinated player. I'm like got vaxed, still apparently feel guilty wear mask transmit virus someone I'm completely asymptomatic. Especially someone 12 immunocompromised. 

I'm getting tired this, pro-mask back day. 

I'll still wear mask...but wish 60% state would get vaccinated. Like now. give fuck opinion controversial. Hell, things considered ""controversial"" even controversial.

For able get them, vaccinations **mandatory.**

Mandatory vaccines new concept. Vaccinations already required able live dormitories college, attend school system, enlist U.S. Army, name few.

This one first times history anti-vax rhetoric prevalent. country rely honor system. wait people change. create law policy mandate vaccine speed process, decrease chance dangerous variants, save money healthcare system, save people's lives.

It controversial opinion. point, way see actually working favorably. husband work healthcare, we’ve staying home *aren’t* working nearly two fucking years homeschooling kids, one immune compromised child. homeschool Governor fucking moron refuses keep masks mandatory told schools don’t impose Covid safety protocols. 

We responsible ones. still are. immediately got vaccinated soon shots available us, minimize community spread, *still* stay home, *still* order groceries pick stay stores, don’t go public without masks, etc. whole attitude “I part fuck everyone else” absolutely fucking selfish. Don’t think we’d like go dinner, send kids school, let go movies friends? anxiety trying support family keeping kids safe immune compromised kid alive anti-vaccine cesspool she’s eligible vaccine isn’t irrational. Hygiene Theater think that's risky short-sighted.

US mask mandates lot places. amount locking down. closing borders pretty much impossible. hard locking covid zero waiting vaccines also pretty much impossible. Thoughts prayer folks, thoughts prayers. I'm worried another virus evolves longer lag time see worse ""non-reaction"" society. know plenty nurses healthcare workers currently among anti-epidemiology crowd/anti vax crowd mind blowing me. study long believe rhetoric? Thanks done, thanks sharing story! health department pop street work, appointments necessary, walk choose 3 available vaccines. still like pulling teeth get colleagues vaccinated. worked deal health department come site work late May, worried they'd disappointed poor turn out, kept saying even giving 5 doses would worth them. said walk vaccination clinic took massive nose dive vaccinators sitting around day arms put shots in. ended giving 44 doses event work thought huge success. seemed defeated pleasantly surprised actually people show shots. felt bad though, literally kept telling giving 5 shots entire day ""success"" days. Fucking brutal.  day hit 2nd dose + 2 weeks (late May), last week pretty much stopped coming here. stop numbering days since pandemic started journal. I’m back wasting time making feel bad I’m happy sounds bit uplifting first, years life expectancy probably chip trade. Reading bit, seems rack numerous violations (at least 1 per game), goal make prohibitively expensive vaccinated. 

It's vaccine requirement extra steps, kind like approach. Hits athletes hurts most; bottom line  bad say schools remain closed foreseeable future, yet ""**At least eight 20 largest school districts US making masks optional students school**""

How people supposed interpret this? Wear protect millions immunocompromised, that? Vaxxed people aren’t wearing masks grocery store since they’re required to. Anti vaxxers aren’t wearing mask either because, even they’re supposed to, they’ll lie say vaccinated. 

But really baffles small sliver population getting vaccine yet still honest courteous enough comply store policy put masks on. Agree. I'm baffled honestly. Way selfish people world realized. Requiring masks public places hardly bringing society grinding halt hope husband gets better soon. symptoms don’t mind asking? I’m vaxxed work busy bar worried catching it. earliest publication regarding registry documented behaviors members (n = 784) using maintain weight loss (10). Three strategies reported consistently: consuming low-calorie, low-fat diet, high levels physical activity, weighing frequently. Recently, fourth behavior identified: consuming breakfast daily (13). behaviors described below. Registry members reported eating 1381 kcal/d, 24% calories fat. interpreting data, important recognize 55% registry members report still trying lose weight consider dietary intake typically underestimated 20–30%. Thus, registry members probably eating closer 1800 kcal/d. However, even adjustment, apparent registry members maintain weight loss continuing eat low-calorie, low-fat diet. 
More recently, examined aspects diet. particular interest fact 78% registry members report eating breakfast every day week (13). 4% report never eating breakfast. typical breakfast cereal fruit.

Get musical artists, movie companies, sports teams donate gear given away parties. Supermarket gift cards too. Bring friend bonuses.  ex chargers fan, made day. Lmao classic redditor defense mechanism. “I’m sorry doctor?” “Are epidemiologist?”

Gotta say, first time I’ve seen, “Are pediatrician?” 😂 oldie goodie book:


*how lie statistics* (has bit misleading title. would better titled, *how lied statistics*(. guys taken break sub COVID heavy sites? really rough time mentally this. take break, help? San Diego early June less 100 cases day. Mask mandate lifted June 15. One month later seeing 1,000 cases day. Oh, also work busy bar unvaccinated coworkers won’t wear masks, even though they’re supposed to. I’ve gone back wearing mask work since many dipshits won’t get vaccinated making pandemic last way longer to. sincerely hope San Diego reinstates mask mandate soon. implying somehow obvious looking numbers? friends family say final goodbyes Zoom.

Her poor parents siblings saying goodbye Brazil Australia zoom. Way ahead ya'..... Never stopped masking.  us following numbers, us still want ignore them. here's one. Like said, simple concept, hard maintain discipline. People still comparing covid flu? thought knew better  doubt colleges universities start cancel person classes soon, happened already. don’t even want catch common cold let alone covid.

If really worried catching cold, may well batten hatches never leave home again. Getting sick, recovering, getting sick, recovering, normal part life. 

Can't imagine anyone incredibly concerned catching cold, something fight rest, Nyquil proper hydration. TBH, hijab debate slightly covid honestly think that’s people equating mask wearing personal freedoms. Masks forced us “they” want us accept hijab, even it’s traditional form. Thanks antivaxers. shit Might want throw stim checks imagine business booming usual soon.  Thank giving detailed answer. Uh....they go school?

Also keeping kids lockdown extremely hard developmentally cause emotional social ramifications years?

This self-centered take. LeARn LiVe C0viD I'm flying LA (high-risk area) soon, I'm little anxious. might sound overkill, substantial risk catching virus airport/on plane? I'm fully vaccinated Moderna since March, young adult, wearing N95, I'm planning taking zinc day (not super strong protection, case).

I'm worried giving COVID parents contract it, given underlying conditions, I'm wondering whether significant possibility.  Great, thanks! Sorry hear that, good paying attention taking effective mitigation measures.  hope employers follow suit.  Appreciate info! Make 146,000 might mean something.  yet US wont even consider giving 3rd shots...nope keep letting doses expire get thrown trash! heard talking head claim freedom go cliff diving pools people swimming below. collide people way down, judge us. worker shortage right now.

Now GREAT time look new job. Freedom Faces? likely both.

I think it'll both.  Infected vaccinated, vaccinated infected, really matter time way seems spread. key vaccinated far less likely experience nastier, severe infection. 

If reduce symptoms resemble common cold vast majority people, live way live chronic diseases. put son in-person kindergarten due fear come find cases public school would gone too. :/  went tri-state 2-week road trip pretty sweet, sweet interval fully vaccinated Delta started spiking.  issue controversy PCR test... could show false positives assumed. I'm sure would great news true. We're high risk, doctor recommended N95 got vaccinated, seems like good idea go back way things going locally Delta variant. turns creating certificate patient recovered, ""Gosuslug"" portal simply takes number Federal Register adds first eight (and vaccination certificates begin number 9). evidenced version certificate specialized JSON format, also downloaded Gosuslug: 15-digit unrz field 16-digit unrzFull - eight front, like certificate number.

Several dozen numbers certificates dates recovery, Sergei Shpilkin collected volunteers, made possible assess real scale epidemic past six months - ""older"" numbers ""State Services"" available, since QR code patient formed previous six months. recent certificates sent - person recovered end June 2021 - serial number 27 million 300 thousand. source Meduza one federal agencies, familiar work Federal Register, asked whether figure corresponds number entries register, replied: “It is.” 


&amp;#x200B;

 
Now, journalists Meduza found out, serial numbers State Services' certificates ill already exceed 29 million. almost five times officially registered number patients country pandemic - six million.

 
Since certificate number created moment person falls ill, certificate issued recovers, number today's certificate would show number entries register (that is, sick) observed two three weeks ago. certificate created person recovered, number certificate refers moment illness. Therefore, impossible say exactly dates peak appearance new entries register fell. Officially, maximum number cases coronavirus Russia - 29,935 cases per day - recorded December 24, 2020.

""The register filled honestly, inaccurate"" 
However, number entries Federal Register accurately reflect number people ill. example, person falls ill again, new record created him. that's all. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
According instructions Ministry Health, people positive result ""laboratory test"" (meaning PCR tests), also diagnosed COVID-19 ""using diagnostic methods"" (according recommendations Ministry Health, speech computed tomography). addition, register includes “all pneumonia cases, including outpatient cases”. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
Journalists unable estimate proportion patients pneumonia related coronavirus register. statistics incidence pneumonia without taking account COVID-19, Mediazona turned Rosstat, already provided data first months 2020. Now, department replied longer separate column pneumonia data incidence coming Ministry Health Rospotrebnadzor. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
In addition, according Meduza source one federal departments, regions determine maintain register: enter cases coronavirus pneumonia, also doubtful cases SARS, 20-30% register.

&amp;#x200B;

 
“The register filled honestly, inaccurate,” explains interlocutor, adding federal level necessary double-check data regions. 
Another error arise evaluating register number due fact patients whose initial diagnosis COVID-19 confirmed removed it, released serial number assigned new patient. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
Among certificates Sergei Shpilkin received, examples inconsistency numbers. example, certificate serial number starting 2327 issued sick person April 2021, number starting 2376 issued patient ill March. 
But error means specific number NRHZ may less real number cases registry.

&amp;#x200B;

 
""Information correspond reality"" 
At request journalists Mediazona Ministry Digital Science (this ministry responsible operation Russian portal ""State Services"") confirm certificate number patient formed basis UNRZ coronavirus register Ministry Health, press service Ministry Digital Affairs replied ""the portal"" State Services ""is showcase data contained register COVID-19 patients operated Ministry Health. "" 
""When generating certificate, register record Ministry Health used"", - said press service response request. 


&amp;#x200B;

 
Meduza Mediazona appealed Ministry Health federal operational headquarters fight coronavirus request comment number entries register differs official incidence reports. headquarters asked provide entire comment. is: 
The federal information resource recording information order prevent spread new coronavirus infection COVID-19, created official use, contains information following citizens: 
\- confirmed diagnosis COVID-19, 
\- hospitalized signs pneumonia, 
\- vaccinated COVID-19. don’t want meet them. want confined home minus masked trips grocery store rest us free passage society thanks vaccine passports. Pretty much everyone know, including got vaxxed COVID, goes outside inside places maskless wanting hear much else what's developing announcement. Shit like CDC period history would last 2-5 years. I'm anything different boosters come out. vaccine solution, immediate. Last year heard many health professionals epidemiologists say would need continue masking distancing even vaccine. mitigation measures together going enable us control spread virus. 

Also, help children vaccinated too, longer emergency authorization legal precedent schools public institutions require along vaccines routinely require. lmao
 
go ahead show there's 100% survival rate covid

keep parroting things bub know spread farmed minks without issue. imagine many wild mammals, spread easily. disagree public messaging. dangers Covid vaccinated individuals regularly stated. taking protocols consideration. 

We 25 children per classroom, masks, 6' distance, desk screens, temp checks. go lunchline next other, eat togther cafeteria, play together playground. 

We data.

I well-versed research husband scientist. wish, correlate, cite sources, etc give data begin 3 weeks. knew brain impacts like grey matter loss brain fog holy shit - let’s hope don’t millions people motor impairment 10 years. Mandatory vaccinations, mask mandates pursue Covid-zero looks appealing me.   posted another sub, valid here, too.

I switched jobs help mobile vaccine efforts; going non-profit health care. used lead manager mass vaccine site 1600 people day, switched mobile pop-up events local stores parks, community outreach go door door ask people get vaccinated recommend others.

You know regularly got, receive even more?

Hate.

I got spit on, called killer murderer, injecting poison children. got bottles thrown me. people talk nowadays say get vaccine government forces to, said they'll gun government forces home. crazy... people rip vaccine facts sheets front scatter around events us clean up. I've people stand us debate us length sinful were.

At point, I'm done helping people. feel I've done part helped much can. can't stand amount hate get daily job; trying bring people want get vaccinated brings worst them.

I'm done. Truly can't see good future society United States experienced trying help society. Aside mask remember wait second shot (2 weeks seems common standard) voices reason speaking there? give instance, I’d say June 15 I’d see one two people Ralph’s / Target etc wearing masks, Nevada one two wearing masks. Shits wild, man  That’s bad picture choice, shines unfair light mahomes. vaccinated. case load finally coming there? 1918 Spanish Flu read Parkinson's cases tripled general population. I'm teen got vaccine--Moderna. feel side effects (tiredness, aches), since stronger immune system younger person. means vaccine working, responding well. side effects completely disappear day. Small annoyance comparison alternative, especially given delta hitting younger people harder variants. Amazing getting downvoted. vaccinated pregnant would ABSOLUTELY helped CDC reinstating mask mandate. Thank one people still seems capacity care others. People become really soft

This true. still catch delta variant pretty bad time. hospitals saying 20% patients vaccinated. source loss smell coming later delta? right put /s 👍 nope. pay guy helped worsen pandemic help solve issue. circumstances N95 absolutely right decision. It’s mask actually filter virus air he’s breathing large degree. 

If he’s vaccinated good health probably doesn’t much worry anyway, knowing he’s wearing mask provides effective protection provide additional peace mind you. lie. went 5500 mile road trip... pretty much nobody wearing masks outside home state California. I’m vaccinated quarantined 12 months, figured I’m probably pretty unlikely get sick / make others sick, MAN prepared nobody else country gives two shits masks Granted lagging indicators


People keep saying UK getting hit pretty good cases month how. hospitalizations going spike significantly, we'd seen now.  places high vaccination numbers, 50% above, we're still seeing spikes cases hospitalizations deaths nowhere near previous highs.

I think big part people vulnerable virus, namely seniors, vaccinated high percentages. Even US, 80% seniors every single state fully vaccinated.  cases getting trend younger younger, logical hospitalizations deaths reaching previous levels.  


*TL;DR-Vaccination works* altered lifestyle one bit. prefer live alive.  really hard wear damn mask? children immuno compromised? virus really exposed callous nature society. It’s discouraging say least. many “let die” takes. we? said 70% before. lying then, lying now? anyone US vaccinated free, many won’t. Sickening. Even then, accept certain aspects biology genetics. NICE wonder ""I ain't gettin' vaccine I'm gonna live free!!!!"" athletes realizing less freedom vaccinated.  incentivized vaccination threat prison. Hearsay doesn’t mean data. That’s means all. 14k fine people make millions even tens millions. Oh, show them!  DeSantis heavily anti-restrictions, people start complete vaccinations, he's essentially praising someone promoting mass deaths.

Restrictions necessary vaccinations completed. people slothed whined moaned vaccinations, that's restrictions become prudent. Thankyou. pains people views credible. picks like 1 100 people agree opinion cites source. It’s horrible Well stated. tried putting anti-mask anti-vax perspective can't reason out. masks uncomfortable would jeopardize health, family's, others'? masks really big infringement ""liberty"" much current sociopolitical status quo truly infringing real liberties left right? 

As vaccines, rather jaded seen large medical device companies cut corners quick buck believe enough research prove vaccines long-term adverse effects waited months getting shots. got data showed small numbers adverse reactions decided benefit outweighed risk.

Even fully vaccinated still wearing cloth mask activated carbon filter, avoid crowded areas whenever possible. negative impact life, freedom? Nope. kept Covid-free? Yup. many school years going rob children? 

Oh god close awareness doubt general public getting fit tested whatever mask they’re wearing. 

Majority generally public achieve fit factor 10. pretty damm good general meme public able put mask founded science. I'm bothered masks, I'm gonna lose mentally lock back unvacciated. Unless physically can't get vaccine, could care less happens point, willing ignoring facts putting risk.

Also stupid cdc saying people could remove masks? could see outcome coming mile away announced somehow didn't? Per day, hope...until get shot Really? get severe flu, pick pneumonia quite damaging. Flu also makes heart failures worse. brush we're used living it. like we're used flu vaccines side effects similar J J without people freaking out. I'm way saying flu right bad covid, definitely not. 

But absolutely right really know many effects kids probably risk it. Really? I'm getting opposite vibe - seeing lot comments sub people basically acting like done mask mandates/lockdowns/etc, want hear anything delta variant anything contradicting efficacy vaccines want get back normal. I'm looking honest info possible vaccinated person catch transmit delta variant nobody seems want talk it. situation provided, person asking anyone bow wishes, they're saying serious threat everyone, included, i.e. relates part everyone. ""demands"" good society whole. 

In situation provided person want wear mask vaccinated want themselves. want everyone vaccinated. want best society. Millions vaccinated people finally living lives rather stuck suffocating masks. Greater good say can't call people selfish saying care wants desires. disagree.

And see since framed liking, clearly selfish.

And frame person advocates masking protect primarily. GAF many people suffer masks provide protection, clearly selfish ones. IFR influenza 0.1%. Worst case estimates COVID 2%, that’s hugely conservative figure, actual figure much lower.

But let’s say 2%. Given efficacy vaccines death, IFR come right around influenza levels. taking worst possible IFR COVID.  CDC says masks on, let guess, people ""start thinking themselves"". 

Unfortunately thing realize world place. pay price someone else's actions uncommon. world live in. priorities would surely change loved ones vulnerable.

Anyways, started this. much painful put masks back vaccinated, either masks everyone vaccine passports. individual hospitalizations either. overburdened healthcare system, matter cause, bound cost innocent lives. feel like things get even worse August September U.S, we're going seeing private businesses requiring vaccines patrons actually checking vaccination status. Lol thats gonna piss many anti-vaxxers happens support constitutional amendment drag anti vaxxers forcibly vaccinate them. Best luck recovery, Buddy. One day time. Yes can, especially delta variant. company known world control many popular culture entertainment properties could lot good took stand used brand visibility greater good...

But, filthy, filthy lucre sitting table... Passports never happen. It’ll hypocritical give passports participate life IDs required vote. 

We live this. Anyways, we’re one variant away virus making vaccines ineffective. Gotta remember billions people aren’t vaccinated US border seems incapable stopping disease coming  nice children 12 
and Republicans house. wouldn’t surprised did, virus weird.  goes chiropractor thinks person valid source info, think uphill battle. 

I would tell vaccines tested authorized quickly cutting lot red tape. trials real, rushed, performed proper amount time get good safety efficacy statistics. getting vaccines fun, highly contagious pandemic disease going around cause orders magnitude health problems, death, someone age. may lucky now, can't last forever. know Covid causes -- ""99% survival, dude"", people get semi-permanent loss smell taste, brain fog, severe long term fatigue, lung lesions, arrhythmia heart attacks, blood clots. Meanwhile, we've given almost 4 BILLION vaccine doses worldwide. safe, order single digits 1,000,000 severe side effects -- thinks that's somehow way worse 10,000 1,000,000 deaths Covid, 100,000 1,000,000 hospitalizations (especially age)? Freedom Tortillas. note lot bulk N95 bulk - come plastic bag (unsealed, maybe taped shut best) placed within cardboard box

That's done. check manufacturer see distributor licensed distributor. 

Maybe medical line N95 , ones nuisance organic vapor bag (so absorb random stuff) I'm willing take chance newer variants there. Also, people long-term effects whether symptoms. take chance easy wear mask? It’s 2 shots little issues. Bunch premadonnas need loosen jocks man up. I’ve moved college sports.  Didn’t know abang fauci mixed Indonesian vaxxed still wear mask. People nasty gross. can’t believe let breathe me.

I got J&amp;J shot, I’m little concerned reduced efficacy. Fwiw, COVID January. mild, still sucked. -1million/10, would recommend.  Eh. Id say 90 95% ppl masked before. 99% arent. rule breakers..  Gottlieb said today follow UK India’s trajectory peak 8-12 days begin drop person demanding everyone else bow wishes selfish.

This missing. situation provided, person asking anyone bow wishes, they're saying serious threat everyone, included, i.e. relates part everyone. ""demands"" good society whole. response, presented it, care what's good others, care what's good you, want yourself.

As said, something selfish based motivation behind it, action itself. exact thing one case selfish, another, not. someone wants people wear masks personally feel threatened, selfish. someone wants people wear masks think *everyone* threatened, selfish. Similarly, someone says *shouldn't* wear masks better *everyone* mask-free, selfish, one person, selfish. presented view along lines latter, i.e. *you* want wear mask, regardless anyone else thinks feels.

For I'm terrified terrorist attacks demand everyone getting plane needs strip searched increase security?

Who's safety trying protect? alone? Everybody's? someone fly worried safety people fly — way would selfish?

And want live damn life, every right do.

Is *one person's* life, *everyone's* life? I.e., saying think society whole, important freedom increased safety? personal enjoyment? former, selfish, latter, selfish.

What say can't call people selfish saying care wants desires. disagree.  traveling Asia 2020 pandemic started. third week January 2020, hotel airline staff, also retail staff, wore masks hand sanitizers available everywhere. general population also wore masks without resistance - no, China one ""forced"".

After arriving back Stateside end January 2020, saw news CDC saying masks ineffective preventing transmission. accurate medical information? think not. China forthcoming data countries data regarding transmission pathways contagiousness. time, masks already ""sold out"" everywhere US Covid-19 US population's radar, sequestered government healthcare workers' use. seems CDC told general population masks ineffective order provide healthcare workers. CDC months plan (data Asia, Europe) react pandemic really ramped US failed miserably. 

I fail see saying ""no masks vaccinated"" responsible strategy data consistently shows large percentage Americans resistant wearing masks and/or getting vaccinated. logical conclude ""those resist masks also resist vaccines"" ""those resist masks get vaccinated avoid masks"". maskless non-vaccinated people making situation worse everyone. skeptical, science-refuting population, CDC's mixed/contradictory messaging helped matters all. conveniently truncated sentence.  Maybe Indonesia new, undetected variant deadly children? I'm attacking lockdowns overall. 

Your reply said NZ's experience representative. say lockdowns failed NZ too. either accept lockdowns work NZ, previous reply make sense. that's economic hardship follows ALOT people. I've experienced witnessed first hand I'm from. seen small business closed shop, employees laid off, lose homes, etc

In NZ Australia govt totally subsidised businesses would shut would lay-off workers. lockdowns business bounced back NZ Australia best economic performance lowest unemployment developed world now. 

In NZ total 6 weeks national lockdown 3 weeks Auckland-only lockdown 18 months pandemic. whole rest time zero restrictions. even wear masks. capacity limits kind. Since people can't travel overseas spent way money domestic travel retail, keeping economy strong. housing market booming. see, lockdowns success Australia.

What? They've incredibly successful every Australian state except NSW, sole anti-lockdown state. Victoria South Australia end midnight tomorrow. Western Australia already back normal weeks. totally stopped previous outbreaks 3 7 day lockdown, gone live normally months time. 

They've two major outbreaks caused failure lockdown. Melbourne last year Sydney. Melbourne learnt lesson well, Sydney learn political reasons. said earlier, lockdowns best approach pandemic. quite obvious awhile now

It's obvious best approach country able control borders. But, absolutely key, work immediately, handful cases. Europe North America never chance, already much virus spread every eliminate via lockdown. lockdowns save health system went on. 

That's totally different approach NZ Australia take can't compare mitigation lockdown strategy elimination lockdown strategy. Thank replying comment. figured something technical getting way. know long it'll take approval possible? chances vaccine'll mandatory? Lets look another way then. numbers, kids 0-12 represent 50 million total roughly 170 million total unvaccinated Americans 29 percent. Yet, represent 21 percent new cases. really represent smaller number expected total cases.  
I suggesting kids get covid, affected covid, ignore it. school masks amidst delta cases. simply pointing there’s reason lose heads panic Honestly, assumed phone auto corrected you. Mask mandate ended businesses statewide. still required gov employees, school children childcare reduced capacity rules till couple weeks ago. yes indoor dining lot red tape. Compared southern states barely rules begin dropped spring.  Idt heavily enforced NFL. long kept testing negative think able still play No. price quoted cost government. truly naive ignorant, frankly I'm sure are....but are, hire social scientists/historians/humanities people, believed, expert infectious disease prepare confront one vital aspects disease control. Namely human behavior. quarantine protocol? Frankly wouldn’t hold breath. said, I’d delighted see decrease.  Elementary daycare here. great. NFL player need vaccine? 

You guys crazy   chance they'll start masking WDW?  organizational memory anthrax vaccine side effects forced still lingering.

The military often exposed things deemed safe time, linked severe health issues later. Agent Orange, Legionairre Disease, burn pits, inadequate ear plugs, permethrin uniforms... June 15th things. unmasking schools childcare rules relaxed last couple weeks. think last ones. Read rest comments thread people say really concern Israeli media making types claims. headache. Severe body aches years really understand fuck went CDC decision making last two years, personally buy ""we thought people would right thing,"" naive bullshit second. seems people claiming real claims Israeli media. maybe take grain salt. Oof. Honestly, maybe could start convincing go doctor general. Maybe hard bother?

Unvaccinated get tested (i doubt willing get tested even mid pandemic days ~2020 Oct, even fall sick close contact positive test)

If get slightly sick, blame common cold without testing (or say covid, like common cold, harmless)

If get seriously sick, find doctor/hospital instead Actual enforcement.

The biggest problem make people wear mask, convince people get booster shot forcing wear mask vaccination anyway. thought prevailing consensus delta contagious severe? think developed world’s experience closer UK Indonesia make growing share represent largest share unvaccinated.

Let’s check out…

(Kids 0-12 population): approx 50m 

(Percentage fully vaccinated 12+): 56.6%

(US population): approx 331m 

331m - 50m = 281m

281,000,000 * .57 = 160,170,000 fully vaccinated people.

281,000,000 - 160,170,000 = 120,830,000 unvaccinated people 12+. 

Even approximations slightly, unvaccinated people 12+ outnumber children double. let’s use statistical manipulation prove point

How exactly statistical manipulation? asked talk doctor, told ""hasn't doctor years"" switched 'all-natural' medicine (like essential oils). 

Faith leader good idea though, thanks long way away infants recommended vaccine imo

The risk reward equation adolescent boys almost toss looking rates serious side effect vax vs. serious COVID complication (both low). 

It’ll take years get formula right get serious side effects manageable level infants gene sequence (I think that’s what’s called) test sample find variant is. places offer tests since takes get results I'm obviously trying get Covid, found got never really knew, I'd consider success.    isn’t current. Kids ICU Oklahoma, Missouri, Arkansas. sort money guys lose back sofa???? Covid measures needed. People freaking fuck non-vaxed people treading new form unconscious conscious bias towards people apparently control germ biome.

That said, you’re scared delta bug, don’t worry, 200,000 variants coming; CCP lockdown 2.0 never happen reasons. fast drop masks supposedly cater families?! Sorry straight despicable them.  Try get talk doctor maybe faith leader trusts who's pro vaccine. Also let know vaccines fully approved soon. Outside that, think there's anything necessarily tell convince her. Good luck! vaccinated person situations, is! I'm glad understand! Please help convince grandma get vaccine. basically begged get vaccine refuses. said 

\- ""not enough testing done"" says long term side effects. 

\- ""\_\_\_\_\_\_ doctor online said get it""

\- pharmacist knows said safe, random 'healthcare' people( like chiropractor) something said safe. 

etc

Basically problem gets news one source online sees article share opinion even click it.

Anyways called expressed concern given reasons. said still would get asked would one favor atleast keep open mind, said would keep open mind article send her. 

So conclusion trying compile list short/credible articles videos safety vaccine get it. send one per day hopefully educate little bit. trying harder thought would be. Anything helps. Thankyou tbh think would good wake call anti vaxers wonder CDU dear full election campaign call possible plateauing cases US??? know weekends low still reported less last weekend.  won’t get sick, still infectious virus stuck nasal cavity antibodies can’t reach. Choosing vaccination masks wrong, answer both, need measures together, solve different problems. Vaccines inside body, masks distancing outside body. That’s Bc dangerous dip DOW took last week I've saying start. checks takes get masses vaccinated, it. suspect diehard anti-vaxxers would continue refuse it. they'll keep theme parks open make easy hell people get sick Florida particular. Chin diaper  want go full union vote get vaccination mandate players

Why though? get would bit hassle, getting teams vaccinated already like pulling teeth.  said, I'm much numbers countries ik Denmark, 1000 daily positive tests vaccinating 100.000. infers number infections level number vaccinated people, 99% actual infections gone unnoticed lot people still wearing masks anywhere indoors businesses making mandatory uncivil. really don’t care LOL See, I'd like walk away go normal human things too. lots social hobbies use take mind bad news. Problem is, can't enjoy things mask mandates place.

Please, CDC, take *mental health* responsible, vaccinated people account decision. also forfeit game pay though. fact, whole team believe. people towns still see getting vaccine smart thing personally affects serious irreversible manner. they'll shout rooftops hoax needs taken seriously, ignored neighbors personally affects them...   don’t think case. going make claim like “the J&amp;J vaccine doesn’t work delta”, better source “I heard”. dangerous vaccines, example one tuberculosis, weakened bacteria. someone uncompromised get could cause life threatening infection.

This fear mRNA unfounded, least paper much safer vaccines far. viruses ultimately produce mRNA replicate themselves. vaccine instead giving weakened virus part virus (like case HPV vaccine) deliver mRNA part virus. Essentially skipping steps. also need adjuvants (like aluminum antivax people complained present previous vaccines). Interesting. work company Mickey Mouse empire, we’re supposed going back office soon… I’ve fun looking types masks people wearing they’re longer mandatory. seems far common see n95s similar now, almost bandanas disappeared. Weirdly, still see people noses hanging well used surgical masks, think that’s stay low information folks.

I’m surprised serious folks serious gear people bare minimum stopped almost entirely, it’s nice make educated guess what’s going happen month right money. Perfect. Awww thank you!!!! kind hope inspires others keep sticking facts! indoors rule 6 people 2 households think lot people ignoring really allowed outside. felt frustrating family sticking rules proper family get together since first lockdown. could met park something can’t trust weather! Naw. average MIN player ain’t going season unvaccinated, taking risk year.p, messing paycheck. way, how! Thank links. said Israel. Good perspective. Thanks adding it.

While I'm it, let mention Covid cost state, California 12.3 *billion* tax payers' dollars. - including 100s millions provided Federal government. Thank replying. hope people choose get vaccinated rates go headline must made majority r/Coronavirus happy.  It’s 14 months still strong levels. Breakthrough cases Delta almost always reduced bad cold less. children. Immunocompromised people get antibody treatment, expensive feasible restricted select target groups like immunocompromised people lots co-morbidities. Yeah, let know start fining unvaccinated players giant assholes. Hope God CDC hold changing mask guidance long. Precisely. need go back takeout delivery only. Oh right. MRNA that. Derp. Ok, scratch that. Just... Generally keep putting things teach immune system fight COVID. Thats it? 14k pocket change guys.  tend good treatments fast-acting viral diseases. time someone notices cold, viral replication could already nearly maxed person suffering organ damage immune dysfunction. 

Tamiflu influenza works take within 48 hours first symptoms. Acyclovir chicken pox ideally given within 24 hours appearance rash, plus side effects iffy recommended routine treatment otherwise healthy children. That's really dumb government's part buy vaccines. last paragraph really mind-boggling. handled COVID-19 properly able get people vaccines? medicine much much difficult making vaccines.

[big pharma I'd imagine still filters virus air. virus sitting mask filter, lungs. Thanks this! *The news comes nearly week NATO publicly decried Disney’s day-and-date release “Black Widow.”*

The National Association Theater Owners REALLY needs change name unless they’re prepared launch joint military operation Mickey Mouse. Didn’t mandate vaccinations polio end mid 80s? 
Most kids today United States vaccinated polio don’t want hear it. 

I don’t give Fuck explanation is. 

If you’re still choosing get vaccinated nothing you’d say matters anymore.  I've heard nothing this. reputable link? wearing masks UK.
They wearing masks India.

Masks required schools. think read “NFL fine unvaccinated players”. Period. Stop. End statement. lot everybody else, too. ambulance covid case ambulance can’t help you, hospital beds, medical personnel. full slot full slot, whether guy deserves doesn’t change anything person needs get can’t.

It’s worth thinking work, too. Everybody job gets sick maimed killed person job period time possibly ever again. lot silly jobs skate without someone while, sure need every day. wouldn’t well long without truckers, agricultural workers, grocery stores, trash collection, number little things make world go around. half population unvaccinated, pretty catastrophic whoopsiedoodles bunch workers get sick time. 

I’m fan antivaxxers, worth acknowledging represent lot warm bodies help keep things running, become cold bodies, things won’t run well. Considering well things running right now, don’t think afford lot worse. It’s everybody’s best interest limit bad gets, *even people hate*, absolutely take rest us them. Lol can’t believe erased yet  mean basically. States like new york 70% vaccinated spread slow, sure unvaxxed getting it, since us vaxxed new york risk tiny pretty much everything open. get states people refuse get vaccinated ravaging spreading faster back last year. crazy. UK seeing rapid decline well. think Delta peak tends short. Yeah I’m wearing mask indoors here, Byzantium Byzantines long start sending people home die? earlier pandemic hospitals. Maybe get people's attention.... knows. specific fines listed offenses. guess already agreed maximum new fines. Holup. person breakthrough case passed 6 people breakthrough?? really hope tests genome tested. That's oversimplified way summarizing right track. extra variables include whoever's local community everyone's global community. one suffered covid all, like zero damage, whatever get us support. may starve beast must stay vigilant war evolves. Hahaha,hahaha.  know rhetorical question someone Arkansas, that's exactly what's driving vaccinations. know several ""covid hoax"" types suddenly started panic last week so. hard give shit though.

Yesterday two headlines pop phone one saying ""Pfizer vaccine effvetcive even year"" another one saying ""Pfizer Vaccine severly drops protection rate 6 months"".

Then later one said ""Pfizer vaccine effective delta variant"" another saying ""Pfizer vaccine 30% effective delta variant"".

I can't see bullshit anymore. made screenshot preety hilarious. death much. Praying recovery. Real life data one thing, think it’s encouraging cases Israel seem grow exponentially like countries dealing delta variant. France, UK, Spain Netherlands seen steeper curve. vaccine really 16% effective 6 months, wouldn’t seen explosion Israel now? Isolation requirements still place too, although that's changing fully vaccinated contacts 16/08. Thanks lot, anti vacciners!   I've found interesting well. I've also noticed higher income areas significantly higher percentages masked people, know county data areas also significantly higher percentages vaccinated people. There's right unvaccinated Germany, can't taken anyone. Vaccination obligatory Germany. measles vaccine currently mandatory many groups people, example. also mandatory scarlet fever, smallpox, infectious diseases. Covid vaccine could well become mandatory well. post far removed reality actually impressive.

I've actually convinced hesitant family members get vaccinated. You, admittedly, haven't, since claiming impossible.

Instead, posting sociopathic shit actually makes people hesitate more, start associating vaccines stuff advocating for. think get anywhere talking random people phone. primary care doctor, talk might able help figure out. Unfortunately, doubt anyone reddit going able help either. doesn’t precedent? paying economic fallout this? No, that's said. Read clear.

""It's worse death"" mean fun, go put situation.

It means, use example expensive hospital stay worse death. really is, could jump bridge pay bill. would stupid, obviously worse death.

Still avoided regardless.  There's still around 1 million tests per day carried UK. Testing ramped down. Gonna sad regret stories start rolling sleeves people. Let's go already.  base statement on? way know would studied recent data well case actually provided that?   Also cost insurance, agents, trainers, maintaining diet, supporting families. It’s Lamborghini talking about. instead waiting ""a month two"" suggesting staying home limiting travel until:

a) countries full vaccination and

b) animals capable spreading somehow vaccinate themselves

Yeah, sounds like realistic plan.   theoretically player get multiple violations day

Assuming study passes muster, would make sense they're viscerally notion partially obscured human faces punishment fine, rule poor.

1) importantly vaccines end game? is? pre-vaccine NPIs last forever ever, point needs end?

2) vaccinated, protected degree, understanding common person expert get COVID-19 vaccinated person, would likely get cold, maybe even bad cold, likely admitted hospital. Unvaccinated different story entirely, problem vaccinated person? person ""chooses"" get vaccine, them, made choice, need live consequences, they? 

My point, even vaccinated person spread grant possible, another vaccinated person would likely cold, even bad cold, major deal, unvaccinated person, could much much more, choice risk, problem it?

Part reason vaccinated people less likely get infected less likely pass virus even get infected, scientists say. vaccinated person without Covid symptoms seems especially unlikely infect somebody else. 
“What clear people vaccinated symptomatic breakthrough infections transmit people,” Dr. Ashish Jha Brown University said. “What clear whether vaccinated asymptomatic people transmit it. best guess — often.” 
He added: “I’m worried asymptomatic vaccinated person spreading me.”

*site redacted, let know want link*

The numbers going little screwy variants, partial vaccinations, better mitigation etc. Still, 2.1% rather smaller 62%. think math checks out.  idea keep everybody happy: make rules restaurant bar optionality construct unvaccinated section, distancing barriers ventilation needed. Right charge higher prices section compensate floorspace, staff. restaurant owner decide build one not, free business owner. economic inventive positive, will. don't, sorry can't enter here. Everybody free choose unvaccinated need bear additional cost consequences antisocial decisions.

I wonder recent work DeepMind ability accurately predict protein structures RNA data utilized - imagine so, especially conjunction mRNA vaccines. 

We could analyze virus, find point virus want 'mass produce' via mRNA vaccine, could run expected RNA sequence AI, see structure likely pop out. imagine would dramatically cut time cost.

The convergence AI, medicine, globalized effort fight viruses really amazing, hope build death pain something amazing.  Depends tax credit. child tax credit straight money back, certain amount per kid. like would mean something, even pay little taxes. think he's taking issue new model put research group UNC associated CDC shows infections accelerating &amp; spreading well fall, peaking October. aggregate model combining various data sets research groups predict US face around 850 4k deaths day Halloween. Dr Nick Riviera doesn't! ...you thank years need booster, so... what's wrong here? play doctor internet Careful, criticized Redditor brigade time say like wearing masks say mask wearing pleasurable fun.

I wear masks, like certainly think ""not big deal"" blanket mask guidelines without end goal good long run.

Redditors saying ""what big deal masks, mask"" another thing Reddit Redditors diverge people real life - even especially took pandemic seriously - stand. Tell everyone trying guilt trip vaccinated latest round mask/social distancing/lockdown hysteria. would mother upset? doesn’t make sense would regret getting vaccination didn’t even chance. Certainly reporter would check that.  think pointing children make weaker vectors particular virus less priority everyone else vaccinated. Good point. cares? Idiots. Let end CFS/ME many doctors nurses would died flat quit every person bought masks way bought toilet paper? Yes Could something delta, seems spiking sharply saw previous waves, maybe burns quickly well. theory, also lot fewer susceptible people past waves. Yes, vaccinated previously infected people perfect protection they're certainly less likely develop symptomatic cases thus become vectors, waves might burn faster too. Yep. Precisely.

It force people get free, widely available vaccine.

The choice theirs. I’m giving fuck. Well done Italy!! Impressive stat.  bad never get ground. next time far right get guy office, defunded pay moat full alligators keep brown people (or something like that) think also factor significant portion population sick quarantining home healthcare system capacity. 

Not everyone able safely isolate. 

I think youngest death 15yr old. (Trinidad &amp; Tobago - Gamma variant). surprising, kind mesmerizing awful way see fast shot up. explain earlier similarly precipitous drop Scotland least. 0-14 age group stayed low dropped little. might say that's get tested much effect visible data spread parents... again, 25-44 age group got bit higher, huge levels transmission fallen much. age groups covering 15-24 cab see huge rises falls data. problem unvaccinated people necessarily choice protect themselves, present danger others, especially places high population density.

It's like rules texting driving. could say people right drive distracted, ultimately present danger people road. much opposition restricting freedom.

I believe people's rights choice getting vaccine not, unvaccinated people greatly increased risk sickening even killing people around (Vaccinated not, vaccine 100% effective variant), oppose required go schools large stadiums, etc. much sub ending disappearing post June 15th 🙄 last time mom could come two years ago, flight August since lift travel restrictions put ticket hold. got vaccinated thought least fully vaccinated people possible come USA. three weeks spend us therefore useless spend 14 days another country come here. keep accused scaremongering. Everyone tired, right rich countries getting vaccinated, even levels low. We're still beginning/midway point pandemic. Epidemiologists still warning surges variants come.  


Reality sucks, ignore make feel better.  Mexicans go negative covid test. friend goes like month see boyfriend (we suspect sugar daddy) lmao  didn’t need vaccine already covid. Plenty folks hospitalized.  talking about? sub anti-mask. comment one responding well upvoted.  understand people getting from? fertility? vaccine specifically causes fertility concerns? There's connection here. mixing effective anyway? Good call article. ""common sense says.""

FTFY comment directly responded stating fully vaccinated individuals forgoing masks either following science care others. responded science. guess science makes appeared I'm threatened (?) promise I'm I'm responding specific comment, general conversation precautions. Yeah good luck 👍 one really. UK pretty opened Freedom Day. difference night clubs really. UK's surge got nice push England making Euros Finals. Agreed. Right circle jerk “carefree vaccination” vaccination = invincibility full swing. 

The U.K. numbers encouraging, I’m curious see U.K. hit timing Israel vaccination drive. Maybe U.K. start report numbers Israel - hopefully won’t agree, that's wanted see source. Unfortunately seem like one guess we're still waiting find *shouldn't allowed word need get third shot 8+ months continue immunity? Removal masks opening nightclubs massive step though. We've seen large cluster form stemming single nightclubs, open UK nightclubs together time, surprising see spike appear.

Having said that, two saving graces come mind immediately: 

1) Fortunately despite opening, peak time colleges universities running normally (most finished year, exam time continuing online now) could lot worse (for example opening fresher's weeks)

2) Like said, people seem sensible enough taking personal precautions despite obligation wear mask (for part, people wearing enclosed space transport shops, great see!).

Regardless, time tell. opnion, certainly unrealistic expect cases hit hundred thousand cases day especialy given restrictions lifted, events taking place, travelling, universities opening also people become little complacent. Let's hope hospitilisations mortality remains low feasibly possible since long numbers we'll counting. correlation vaccine immune response efficacy? shots (Pfizer) times side effects sore arm/injection site. realize clinical trials, said something like 50% people reported side effects well, know studies look without immuno-response whether protection lower get response? Time double guess pretty effective in, what, 40%? Yay it’ll take even longer Jesus. Idk maybe I’m wrong feel like place like Australia could easily navigated government right thing beginning. It’s lot easier lock country like guys state like Hawaii keep people vaccines available. feel like whole western world handled poorly. one seems okay China that’s they’re authoritarian force people lock down. comment say supported wanted happen, happen outbreaks keep happening. entire lockdowns people seem think government impose occupancy limits? totally see local governments making occupancy limits last year. one wants that, y'all go ahead skim want without comprehending I'm actually saying.  You’re wrong importance technology. Modern tech meant virus identified sequenced matter weeks; existing work SARS allowed develop BioNTech vaccine more. Basically end January 2020 Pfizer vaccine using today final form. two things happened: 

1. manufacturing facilities supply chain (and are) task putting vaccines billions arms. 
2. testing process took year, even though accelerated. 

Manufacturing something theory prepare for, especially mRNA platform really takes off. 

But testing part bigger deal - however accelerated was, still wasn’t fast enough millions died (and consider bad could mortality rate higher). need something faster testing system have, thing could accomplish probably reliable *in silico* *in vivo* testing instead addition conventional clinical trials. someone would kind, trying answer ""impaired fertility"" objection vaccine hesitant relative. pregnant now, concerned vaccination might impair fertility. I've passed fact 22 women became pregnant Pfizer trial problem, several medical articles/physician posts saying really medical basis concern, I'm wondering anyone seen retrospective studies either miscarriage rates impaired ability conceive vaccinated population. think might get concern study like exists. hard-core anti-vax, I'd like respect concern rather shame, answer data. Many thanks advance. right public health researchers sure much spread asymptomatic mildly symptomatic vaccinated carriers transmit Delta. Israeli study showing 80% breakthrough cases lead community transmission, there's still anecdotal evidence Delta infect members household (all fully vaccinated), basically close-contact situations. would similar work/office/warehouse/factory environment co-workers. symptoms require medical intervention key concern non-vaccinated come close contact become ill. problematic vaxxed ppl may even realize they're positive, mistaking symptoms allergies even heat-related overexertion. Nothing, wear want to, nobody going stop you. maddeningly dumb.

The UK's math wanting vaccinate under-18s simply good. They're looking individual risk comparing tiny chance catching COVID versus risk vaccination. considering chance exposure COVID eventually approach 1, others exposed process. France already passed US percentage people first dose second dose.

Their vaccination rate per population also much faster.

Check Bloomberg COVID-19 tracker. nurses antivaxx? social bubbles extremely important many countries made policies completely deprive people social contact. Yep, that's majority sub coronavirus sub. swear foreign accounts posting propaganda order get people scared US economy tanks. parents learned, “carrot stick” approach often isn’t effective there’s stick involved. vaccine hesitant definitely antivaxxers, aren’t going bribe change little $2k propose posts. Maybe even lot that.

The people digging heels vaccination either think consequences actions (“It’s big deal young people, I’ll fine.”) figure odds rather (“Only people conditions die.” “Almost one dies it,” ignoring numerous documented long term side effects many survivors.) immediate consequences *not* taking vaccine, you’re going get budge. that’s even addressing substantial number people become identity issue. bribe going work brainwashed, offering one provides “evidence” great conspiracy.

This reason polling shows sizable chunk people get vaccine forced job. see immediate drastic consequence taking action.   issue theory states show improvement first ones curve current wave, states certain ignore new CDC recommendation issue mask mandates. situation improve despite ignoring CDC recommendations, potential greatly weakening CDC's credibility mask recommendations going winter.

This CDC absolutely change guidance. wait least another 10-14 days look evidence patterns we're seeing UK show places like Nevada, Arkansas, Missouri, Florida, Arizona, etc. Nurses antivaxx. France actually even higher vaccine hesitancy rate US. least past vaccines has. Exactly talking referring to. Thanks proving point.

Thanks got vaccinated state Texas decided lift mask mandate May. knew delta variant unvaccinated would use lifting mandate stop wearing masks thus making incubators new strain. best protect can't count others you. people need shamed. can't allowed keep putting others risk due insane beliefs without facing consequences. actual, legitimate experts. Seems like bad idea recommend nationwide mask mandates point. Say do, southern states ignore it, many northern states won't. southern states, wave, likely close cresting it, given we're seeing UK Netherlands. that's going happen precisely headlines criticizing ignoring new recommendation published. scenario ends playing out, going shit show good look anyone follow recommendations winter approaches.

You responded two anecdotal arguments ""logical"" people breakthrough cases would get long covid too. agree logic important.

THEN tell responded person proof. closest thing find tell someone heard ongoing study yale *might* studying link study released conclusions.

 getting snippy can't read, I'm snippy posting misinformation acting shitty it.

Post links gets lot easier everyone unfortunately Republicans usually one's making comments.  fairly straightforward math. herd immunity thing, need certain percentage population immune unable spread disease. estimate, estimates alpha variant around 70%. possible delta variant would require something like 90% though.

In United States, currently almost exactly 50% inhabitants vaccinated. 160 million. also 35 million known covid cases. Now, possible there's overlap two groups, also lot covid cases measured. we're talking rough numbers. population 330 million, leaves 135 million people left immunity whatsoever.

To get herd immunity, need 90%. 90% 297 million. need another 100 million people gain immunity. enough data know COVID kills 1% infected people best case - hospitals overrun people get effective medical care. we've seen number countries, hospitals get overrun, number goes LOT. 3%. 5%. happen. People would otherwise survive end dying cabs, trying get hospitals full. Bodies end floating rivers, there's place bury cremate them.

So depends fast COVID burns remaining population. could another million deaths, refuse vaccination. could 3 million, Delta keeps growing exponentially.

If vaccines ended effective, still barely effective treatment options, instead highly effective prevention options? Take deep breath ask 3% 330 million people is. big number. reached eventually people covid form immunity.

So (vaccinated + covid recently) reach 90% many countries coming months. True take weeks anyone actually takes masks  dont time desire that, research educate instead expecting others you. many websites discuss spend modicum time looking continue irresponsibly fear mongering … there’s nothing harmful wearing sunscreen, even night?

Like even analogy wasn’t braindead, it’s still slam dunk think is.

The vaccine *also* like wearing sunscreen it’s cloudy, it’s winter you’re snow, it’s sunny, you’re beach, literally time. point works it’s dangerous, even analogy admits. Practically none high enough though. Lol “being fed”? exactly? Multiple peer reviewed journals? medical scientific communities large? Immunologists? Epidemiologists? NIH? CDC? Globally correlated data? they’re saying exact thing. work restaurant vaccinated literally can't take time it? meant countries high vaccination rates. course poor countries like 1% population really choice. I’m currently America, haven’t able go back home Portugal wouldn’t allowed back (L1 visa holder). way would spend two weeks central America somewhere, hoping avoid it’s incredible hard justify point time  sure, quote person see said it. Well great news least means delta stopped Even refused vaccine, contracted covid?  California, rising cases come political backdrop upcoming recall election Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. allowed state reopen June 15 hesitant impose new requirements mask-wearing social distancing, even major counties — including Los Angeles County — require urge residents wear masks Voters start receiving ballots mail three weeks, election day scheduled Sept. 14. lightning strikes

So, let kids fine parents letting kids play lightning storms metal rods? That’s opening schools Delta running rampant equivalent to. kids playing storm won’t die, it’s big deal, right? one kid dies several suffer long term damage aren’t big deal, right? kids died COVID like it’s kind gotcha juvenile unproductive. 

Never said gotcha. Go back review context messages. first primary point COVID affects children negatively. Especially Delta. death isn’t metric judge that.

But course there’s always anti-maskers vaxxers think children consequence equation it’s travesty suggest protect novel virus zero protection from. Like user responded to.

Again, primary point covid devastating effects children outside death. response children aren’t dying it. provided source contrary. It’s simple. It’s gotcha, it’s data contradict point. point whether significant. 

It is. Glad established that. Outside death myriad complications know possibility don’t. novel virus, itself, information long-term, significant. suggest protect children that, mutated form virus that, crazy. What’s crazy users suggesting children fine sacrificial lambs. sugar nearly food. problem leads problems even problems Depends looking at. we've seen success mRNA vaccine tech, [it's already applied vast majority people compromised immune systems get vaccine. clarify, narrow mask mandate affects following mask mandate effect city government facilities, early childhood facilities, hospitals, transportation – including guided tours.

Also, nothing says nationalist better marching allow virus kill compatriots. almost like dealing pandemic caused novel virus type crisis manage disregarding context evolving circumstances. Shocking.  Thx Ah yes, ABC, leader scientific reporting evidenced unpublished internal CDC document they’ve obtained doesn’t take account 18, asymptomatic cases, doubt based solely testing because, mean, they’re longer tracking breakthrough cases. high level shit based estimates conjecture.

Hey caring differences things function you. assume anti vax pretty dumb. car analogy perfect! put diesel gas car work? would like suggest everyone send $5. don’t to!

""Ha! threw shit walked room!"" - Fauci ohhhhh.. im scared here's government boogeyman... makes one wonder half American populace made criminals crooks scared ""government""? Even Republican politicians were/are part government talk anti government BS. Weird shit. sounds lot like ""let eat cake"" single parent takes bus work. Probably great business, suppose this. People (I'm NYC) still wearing masks indoors maybe 50% wearing outside too. There's need additional mask mandates we're still wearing them. still remember Spring 2020 even people parts country forgotten. Also add fact mostly can’t know often vaccine prevents infection. Maybe someone restaurant, grocery store Covid could infected you. Unless lot contact tracing, nobody know nobody posts it.  I've noticed lot new mask announcements Southern cities. St. Louis mask mandate, Atlanta masks schools, Savannah mask mandate. believe Moderna currently conducting pediatric trial children aged 6 months 12 years. Considering state 64% least one dose, assuming 64% evenly distributed areas (I assume not... Lookin' Nunes McCarthy's districts...), feels like bit self-own P&amp;L standpoint.

Those can, course, forged, that's serious crime go criminal record can, worst case, result jail time. shit. knew time vaccine passports going thing.

I think reality bifurcation health response ofset, combined crippling stupidity populace, meant good options. die cast long ago.  Easy fix. Lockdown unvaccinated. That's surprising. Indian living India. know heard children dying India due covid. Maybe - mean follows logic. Mitigative measures prevent healthcare system issues. issues need measures. Well also could end badly say fuck leave sometimes even abusive underpayed jobs lots overtime jumping sick coworkers.

Than already existing shortage ppl willing job might worsen lot. Amazing. Make lives harder.

The willfully unvaccinated reading this: dominoes falling. world LEAVING behind. entire world going require vaccination proof.

Bars, restaurants, shops, movies privileges, rights. choice yours.

Get vaccinated get shoved back society. We’re done caring you. breakthrough cases, effects COVID reduced? vaccine, others. care works like care car works. I've AZ vaccine fine, caught covid. Everyone know vaccine fine. attention seeking morons anti vaccine vaccinated before. know right! people get haul this. Sickening. issue mask mandates difficult square “life usual” otherwise. doesn’t make logical sense require mask go Whole Foods, sit eat Applebee’s next door. 

Masks needed everything closed go grocery store couldn’t social distance. don’t know valuable mandates everything movie theaters bars museums fully open. Bleeding where!? mom needs go doctor. back normal lives. got second vaccine March.

Good you. We're 6 months behind vaccine rollout due procurement failures (with task made difficult US hoarding vaccines) end game misinformation suggest lockdowns table indefinitely.

The whole Australia except Sydney lockdown tomorrow. frustrating able go international holidays usual, pandemic great opportunity see Australia looking forward 10th domestic holiday pandemic weekend.

My state 6.5 million people 820 covid deaths (90% Australian covid deaths) loss life considered acceptable considered cautionary tale states importance getting top outbreak quickly reach high level vaccination. strong suspicion Euros.

They ask point getting vaccinated go lockdown again. 

Personally stuff close again, 100% meet vaccinated friends family regardless rules. Something keep mind breakthrough infections...

Roughly 5% cases seem breakthrough cases, US 7 day rolling avg around 50k.

That means daily ~2500 breakthrough cases (again rough guess/easy rounding here).

The majority 2500 rush social media (including reddit) post breakthrough case. lot friends family post ""how know someone break case"". acquaintances people heard social media start telling know know breakthrough case.


etc, etc, etc.

You see quickly breakthrough cases sudden sound like thousands ""everyone"" getting breakthrough cases, reality still amount people - within deemed acceptable CDC Yeah minimum wage worker going physically put hands someone risk lawsuits infection? swear people outside year. No, vaccine isn’t cure-all. think people understand that. bulletproof vest doesn’t keep anyone wears one dying gunshot though it? condom doesn’t 100% guarantee woman avoid unwanted pregnancy either. point being, plenty things made prevent something doesn’t 100% success rate, drastically help avoid unwanted results given situation. 
And think mutations happen? going multiple people. COVID manage go multiple people point Delta variant? going us unvaccinated taking necessary precautions. things science taught us long time ago nothing new.

I’m claiming expert, I’m not. There’s still lot research needs done end, you’re expert either, maybe don’t go around acting like are. MS still can’t get approved 😂🤦🏻‍♀️ ""Low risk"" ""no risk"" spreads, mutates, longer shit drags on.

I think much ask people continue cautious. Like, I'm getting crowded bus, I'm gonna put mask on. I'm going prefer takeout sitting crowded restaurant. I'm going hang jam-packed bar go sardine indoor concert.

Juist saying Western European countries easily blow past 60% vaccinated, 80% pretty feasible. Getting whole world vaccinated important though.  I'm confused. Entry abroad, communities takes hold unvaccinated people.

So would seem logical worry external risk, best available mitigation would still vaccination.

This reduces math, highly logical, hence insurance folks lawyers arrived policies have.

We choose like not, pretending ineffectual either highly disingenuous, willfully uninformed. Also harmful people around you.  I've seen nothing Toyota ads Olympics Yep, lunch friend France spend week two Mexico City cruising LA without issue. That's substitute proper trials. Besides, need live cultures virus that? target 80% total population? Children 12 already low transmission, low risk serious infection certainly encouraging sign even though Delta hits hard, peaks fast.

I don’t understand. got back Disney World past weekend well. controlling crowds would hate see like controlling crowds. jammed people. Wore mask half time, rules made sense. Masks required transportation, else. Saw plenty people wearing masks not. Still good time outside give kids dad stares half time. point punish vaccinated, shouldnt give money first place. would even enforce it? give money right away vaccinated? fully vaccinated months? rest us? didn’t say wasn’t self harmful petty.  also problem unvaccinated US citizens going vacation countries coming back, vaccinated non-Citizens/Perm residents visit family. can’t even get back you’re work visa. know put clothes!! people make wear clothes outside, must unconstitutional. People sub need grasp this. COVID part life now. goal always “make sure doesn’t overload hospitals” since that’s really causes spikes deaths. 

Well we’ve done that. Nothing left get vaxxed move on. living rest damn lives masks. want that, unlike vaccine, choice.

For example, gov allow increase price list accepted issues. Pay 2k fine 3k next tax cycle. people deserve rewarded.

Hard go back celebration case graph looks like mountain death graph looks like mole hill. 


Previously peak deaths followed peak cases 2 weeks, we'll see looks like week so, can't imagine suddenly shoot up. Vaccines clinic hospitals 100% mandatory unless immune system compromised. healthcare professional largely dealing sick people potentially die Covid. Irresponsible even begin describe people. laziness, selfishness highest degree. Where’s science says there’s single “healthy” weight? Still don’t see study citations essay wrote. This. going spread, less symptoms. truly think cause. Early people driving across multiple states get possible calling every vax center within 100 miles. 4 % still means every 25th doctor see vacinated. never said that. I’m saying human body converges towards healthy weight feed natural human diet (no added sugar, refined flour, processed foods, lots veg, periods fasting). reason people fail maintain weight loss long term don’t stick healthy diet long term. 

It difficult run scientific study ‘proves’ anything related health nutrition many uncontrollable variables. Additionally, many modern obesity-causing suspects weren’t even around 50 years ago (especially processed foods) hasn’t much time long term studies prove effect bodies. 

Just science health muddy, doesn’t mean one give health. 5 scientifically proven ways lose weight listed great idea anyone’s health. common bring closer natural human diet. shouldn’t surprise obesity mostly new problem it’s mostly caused new food sources. highly doubt NFL play every game. love money much dont give fuck players (see CTE) irrelevant all... much less likely get **less people capable transmitting them**.

And look total number deaths children, # deaths per month gone considerably since vaccines came out.

So yes, less kids dying vaccines out. Basic logic data. Nice try though. 

""Top 10"" - literally 10th. likely pushed back 20-30th year, even children get vaccines.

Also keep mind talking people age 18. Probability 8 year old dying covid much less someone 17.

And, keep mind, even distinguishing pre-existing conditions. I'd agree 16 year old diabetes overweight getting vaccine.

Also find interesting article makes mention many kids died 9th leading cause death, relative information judge compares. Govt mandate vaccines across entire US population. Like immunizations went school. 
It public health emergency. I’m sure paying attention news education would help much young people don’t vaccinate.

The truth young generally safe COVID. So, reason get vaccinated add herd immunity help community large. aren’t motivated that, won’t get it. see like nuns HPV vaccine (in future). sex, need. threat me, bother me. Actually, campaign TV tiktok whatever young people days tag line “save grandma” may effective straight vaccine education.  vaccinated CDC counts case breakthrough. unvaccinated asymptomatic still counted.

-	increase mask supplies?
-	increase locations vaccine production?

That's even infected, vaccinated individual typically get lesser disease symptoms. Furthermore, exposure body regularly produce antibodies circulate blood, measure ""antibody titer"" determine effectively immunized someone - higher antibody titer targets desired pathogen, better body preventing infection first place. instance, got summer job hospital immunizations number diseases confirmed antibody titers found Hep titer threshold, got Hep booster vaccination.

As myocarditis (heart inflammation) occur rare vaccine side effect, sadly straightforward answer you, though current topic research surprised find coming months. following stuff purely best guess based knowledge majored biology 4 years PhD studying developmental biology fruit flies - though strictly same, concepts carry skill reading interpreting biomedical literature, I'll openly admit (in opinion) immune system one complex difficult understand areas human biology along central nervous system.

Inflammation general part immune response, basic sense divide immune response local, immediate inflammation acts generally systemic, slower antibody response specific foreign object reacting to. Specifically, myocarditis observed response viral infections, including flu SARS-nCoV-2 (the virus causes COVID-19), though whether due specifically virus infecting heart tissue occurring virus infects tissues. One possibility springs mind myocarditis occur SARS-nCoV-2 infections non-heart tissues (which would immune mechanism, specifics uncertain time), myocarditis events case vaccine would likely occur path. so, also may provide potential method preventative treatment COVID-19 vaccine-related myocarditis block path safely. Another possibility, though I'll admit fully know far fetched may be, would mRNA vaccine taken cells either circulatory lymphatic manage migrate heart mRNA degraded, heart make present viral spike protein cause immune response occur heart tissues. immune response could reasonably include inflammation. important note still actively replicating virus, merely one cells producing single viral protein cell heart. events would rare, data shown, higher young males, myocarditis generally higher young males would hazard guess whatever factors make susceptible general (such response flu infection) would apply myocarditis vaccine-related.

Just final note, though Israel study find increased myocarditis young men response vaccine, important note includes minor cases clear within weeks, risk severe, life-changing effects significantly lower \~1/5000, here's nice link Yale I'd still recommend everyone eligible, including young men, &lt;25yo man happily mine. Hope helps some, questions I'd glad take shot them! may counted covid cases deaths?

My comment context reward system someone brought up. course fine would never work many practical reasons, main point deserve rewarded.

Let's say already work logistics 2k reward everyone vaccinated vaccinated. Short term reward increase vaccination address fundamental problem. next pandemic would put us back square one.

I honestly easy answer. Education would best way solve long process. Money great motivator change behavior. Plus seems unlikely another stimulus would pass. It’s France. It’s do. simple fact you’re suggesting bribing people get vaccine sums ridiculous situation is. Or, flip side hold accountable actions. want get vaccinated? Fine. get sick end hospital, get full bill. dischargeable bankruptcy. Let precious insurance companies refuse cover cost. spend rest lives making payments every month Covid-induced hospital stay.

The thing they'll care putting money big mouths are. Read bold line. 

Their claim: kids aren’t dying.

My source: least 297 children died. I'm sorry deal nonsense close personal. 

The craziest thing (to me) nurses like co-worker saying need see ""more research"" like...why? 

As far know, y'all took biology A&amp;P microbiology part nursing school, right? feel like provided solid grounding vaccines work, mechanics RNA viruses. feel like anti vax nurses required retake whatever classes covered material first place obviously learn well. Aunt nurse practitioner antivaxx (though won’t straight admit it). Nearly entire clinic got shut one employees tested positive. Aunt 1-year old son forced quarantine. Great job putting new family jeopardy refuse vaccinate.

So I’m definitely board this. Nurse Aunt FORCED vaccinated wants keep job, Nephew’s sake least. Well, clearly wrong. *should* something everyone agree don't. Nope. Time stick. vaccinated allowed participate society. Make uncomfortable alternative ie vaxxing seen viable. working workplace others, school children except home, entering places business entertainment etc.   lol works. comment solidly topic relevant post. taking discussion away original point thread. anyone know close US might heed immunity? Specifically, I’m wondering know many people US don’t vaccine haven’t contracted COVID yet? feel like must relatively small number. makes challenging probably lot people potentially COVID aren’t showing case totals, either asymptomatic caught early testing wasn’t widely available. Well genuinely believe that, fudging numbers. chance 50k+ positive tests day it’s accurate make sense. think push vaccination vaccinated people still catching COVID? 

As long established studies showing vaccinated people can’t spread Covid others, getting vaccinated simply proof others. does? yes, vaccination good idea, employers right mandate vaccination staff customers. millions vaccinated people, handful mild cases COVID.

Source? personally know “a handful” vaccinated people contracted Covid. I’d like see numbers. missing point vaccination. goal prevent illness, prevent death hospitalization. fact COVID vaccines incredibly effective preventing deaths hospitalizations COVID. That's goal, worthwhile reduce impact disease. vaccinated people still catching COVID, remarkably rare. And, data indicates highly unlikely vaccinated people spread COVID.

No, missing point. Thus far, getting vaccinated scientific proof I’ve seen prevents getting sick. Without proof, vaccination personal choice, since vaccine benefits me. disagreeing that. don’t ignore best option we’re broken even try many places. Limited pain points like cruise ships sporting events would outsized effect behavior implemented states won’t go immediate armed insurrection they’re announced. Thanks. got yet, I'll eventually get either AZ SinoVac (more likely latter). able find sources I'd feel little better. caught covid. deaths undercounted tens millions population urban centers literally overun covid currently antibody rate 56 percent Dehli example. So. want experience India Delta... Burying dead massive unmarked graves throwing rivers wood left creamate them...get Vax mask up. Yes no. Younger people safer somewhat, now. Delta variant targeting younger younger people though. Getting vaccine would help herd immunity, would also prevent getting ill hospitalized. agree, much hate say don’t think Republicans politicians fully blame this. Antivaxers tend uniquely distributed across spectrums society - granola crunching hippies, wealthy white women 30s, people color. republicans likely blame recent shift white rural men getting vaccinated, antivax movement sadly runs across lots different people. Ah, yes, one guy one time used performance-enhancing drugs. Glad never happen again.  can't let reference fade long time. Well told Covid gave sniffles, felt safe, even mild symptoms signal covid. 
So go those, bot coughs. need circulate new info quickly. ""Hidey Ho Neighbour!""  Exactly! never understood current administration kept on. plays politics actually caring public health. Seriously...if going get vaccine, acting like lockdowns still full effect. Keep distance, mask up, wash hands time touch anything. Honestly big deal masks? due AZ blood clot issue something else?   live relatively high income area, suburbs. Mask compliance basically 100% everywhere went past year. county something like 65% completely vaccinated 18+, data state dashboard leads believe particular area live probably higher that.

Today I'd say *maybe* 1 10 people see wearing masks that's probably generous.

I'm judging, though. hardly wear mine days. always one I'll use required I'm going extended close-contact people, wear places like grocery store Home Depot anymore.  haven’t looked Missouri data closely we’re ever hit really hard like states earlier waves? I’m wondering low vaccination numbers may also lower natural immunity well. Even directly affected still make excuses....well believe really COVID - underlying condition favorite well apart ""God's"" plan. God testing us right now.  Peak August 30 less.

Those learn right ZERO empathy towards others cannot see something unless DIRECTLY affected. I'm sure though COVID nothing cold, maybe flu....it's nothing. Government seeking dampen excitement potential peak Covid-19 infections daily case figure fell sixth consecutive day. Boris Johnson believes impact last Monday’s “freedom day” drive infections meaning UK “not woods yet”, spokesman number infections reported Monday 24,950, drop 40 per cent figure one week earlier. lowest daily number three weeks confirms decline cases statistical past week first time nation’s epidemic turned growing shrinking without full lockdown. Experts pointed impact warm weather, school holidays end European Championship football uncertain whether decline Ministers Downing Street officials concerned good news cases could encourage people let guard send trend reverse. 10 spokesman said: “Throughout pandemic always said it’s encouraging cases falling… PM said many times pandemic woods “I don’t think seen impact step four case numbers yet. We’ve always clear step four roadmap, given entailed, believed would lead increase cases.” Government wants encourage use regular lateral flow tests, well vaccine uptake, stop infection rates spiralling control. Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned country must brace daily figure hit 100,000 day effects greater indoor mixing following 19 July take hold. weird headline. [The actual interesting, there's lot going headline Guardian article suggests.

 
In UK: 

* least lonely group one frequent face-to-face virtual contact. 
* group highest wellbeing frequent face-to-face contact, amount virtual contact made difference.

 
In USA:

* group highest wellbeing was, again, one frequent face-to-face virtual contact.
* loneliest group one headline refers to, frequent virtual infrequent face-to-face contact.

 
Miscellaneous bits interest:

* sure whether loneliest American group cause effect -- whether experiencing loneliness burnt virtual contact, whether initiating virtual contact lonely (I would buy either explanations, tbh).
* People living alone face-to-face contact countries (I could take punt case UK -- living alone lockdown allowed form ""support bubble"" meant could freely mix one household size. know anywhere USA similar policies). 
* Data collected postal questionnaire USA, online one UK, might mean different levels comfort technology, not.
* USA got much lonelier overall pandemic. UK 11.1% people got lonelier, 13.6% people got less lonely.
* Guardian article interviews first author study, quotes saying older people unfamiliar technology stressed it. definitely thing general, quote research study, can't see anywhere asked dataset it, knows.

tl;dr: contact better, face-to-face actively helps; beyond that, shit's complicated.

 
I work area adjacent (hence interest) basically finding older people *extremely* split whether virtual contact helpful harmful (but also depends partly activities use for). would also note big stressors lot people work much things like getting online installing Zoom, general mistrust stuff like online safety privacy; softer skills internet really scary without. joking right? People work lower end pay scale fucking love getting money back tax returns. sudden living high life couple weeks, new iphone, sweet white nikes, etc.

Trust me, poor people care tax credits. make sure refundable tax credits. Nah you’re scared stay inside risk getting vaccine disease. Smart kids. proud them. Yeah, definitely care much strangers' opinions general.  I'm stating pretty basic fact. Taxes used time try change public behavior. 

Having tax incentives, penalties vaccination status could clearly fall bucket.

FWIW, read comment applying unvaccinated (which would also clearly public health bucket).

I think best way go things, thing similar use taxes incentive sorts behavior.  point it'll years see friend London, cry lot Congrats Italy. do. access sinovac AZ...

now people queueing vaccine ever before..the people kinda ignore hoax fear mongering news vaccine kinda slowed now..since people sick fuckin thing..they would take chance vaccine rather another strict lockdown 


but reason vaccination slower 2 things..

1.indonesia geographical location harder reach big country world..some us even live deep jungle mountain even live middle toba volcano lake..so gotta remember that

2.we got majority vaccine bulk ""Raw"" material..not ""ready use"" vaccine..and theres limit per day 500k-1mill per day..

&amp;#x200B;

but big city indonesia (especially jakarta medan) pretty high vaccination rate..so yeah..i hope done shit sooner..  Young people pretty much safer everything…except maybe stupidity.

The shifting numbers still overwhelmingly show young people safer. change ratios young old infected reflection difference vaccination rates. one good thing though shows vaccinations working…really friggin well.

Put another way, numbers arbitrary, previous ratio let’s say 100 old 1 young person. vaccination, it’s 10 old 1 young person 10 11 ratio unvaccinated. Well new variant new variable vaccination status top dependent variables, drawing conclusions difficult even pretty obvious.

Vaccines reducing severity symptoms hospitalization probably true. young people minuscule hospitalization rate something even lower vaccinated need exorbitantly high number cases power statistical proof unlikely.

Bottom line: vaccines work, don’t selfish, get vaccinated, save grandma Oh shit hadn’t even considered that. it’s honestly joke. tourism business travel would beneficial USA too. Especially pandemic. Actually it’s true, it’s also people confirmed appointment (and therefore got letter email via burger’s profile) showing up. I’m guessing missed part statement “that I’ve seen”. 

What studies done topic? isn’t CDC singing study results rooftops?  Eh, think ""further along"" might regards estimates peak late October. 

And think agree that. UK numbers anything go by, might see peak states late August-early September. Good italy, hope european countries catch least %70 goal . Tell liberal bubble without telling liberal bubble I've got verbal reports news Icelandic. probably wait something solid make absolute claim.

But really, 70 percent (75 yet 2 shots + 2 weeks) really expected see heard immunity. That's 85 percent people 16 (not yet + 2 weeks) we're getting close done. wonder soon U.S. follow similar trend. good news it’s falling rapidly. friend’s cousin nurse trying use religion way get getting vaccine.  Fun fact, chances winning vaccine lottery Ohio lower chance bad reaction vaccine.

I mean they're astronomically low, 1 million. goes show lack critical thinking people have. Actually lot people hesitant novax, first doses dropping lot lately going back PM Draghi introduced Green Pass restaurants, cinemas etc. 
Iirc people months ago near Bergamo protesting vaccine, people saw military trucks full corpses going road. get diet soda hallelujah? Vaccination rates lower US, I'd guess it'll take longer peak there. real good news US death rates remain low. Hopefully continues, seems unlikely, unless delta actually less deadly... Yeah, also social psychology aspect... revising guidelines say vaccinated people need mask going cause least people fence get vaccinated think ""well what's point"". already boat due honor system. Bringing back mandates may make realize either need get vax may forced back mask public places. Additionally, read NYtimes 1/10 Americans want vax haven’t gotten yet. Rising cases, hospitalizations, deaths may incentive hold outs get vax soon. mean try interpret charitably possible, probably true least *some* group frequent virtual contact lonely. 

But great, no. given make point article equipping older people digital skills might offset stress virtual contact, particularly like headline reads justification putting resources so. come UK? meet somewhere like Mexico Portugal somewhere meet. means ""please require masks want face protests mandate."" Where's leader. 😂 I'm Algarve now. shops thing weekends. curfew nights still huge here, especially Vilamoura Albufeira.

This measures really nothing compared we've before, people respecting much less.  would want that? Wait Savannah “asked” businesses follow it? mean? sounds like it’s actually required government facilities news sky blue currently needs go country

Even that's true doubt strongly someone wants pay two weeks isolation another country able fly US - regular tourist anyways. get US Mexico. Ask drug dealer get US

The US almost full ban. I'm Europe allow Americans come US; border closed despite people vaccinated.

I think EU close borders even playfield.   NL.  are? That's great! think vaccination rates really high there, well. Yes, helping fellow human reason enough.    [Savannah transmission also reduced, vaccinated still vulnerable. Vaccines magical forcefield, bulletproof vest prevents getting injured. easier can't eat pizza without shot. That's what's happening Italy France  Sad ppl convinced get vaccinated. India vaccines get vaccinated. Wat world live in. Damn wealthy like beautiful sorority girl. talks talk *knows* real value; that's value have, little mouse. It’s reprehensible isn’t already mandated. Imagine going oncologist contracting covid idiot antivaxer nurse. selfishness ignorant people infuriates me. Im sure it’s hard number track exact situation surely killed people already. make everyone mad. Medical exemptions part every vaccine mandate I'm aware of. noted medical contraindications COVID vaccines, relate life-threatening allergies associated vaccine components. Due variety vaccines available, generally vaccines lack allergens nearly everyone.

People immunocompromised still get vaccine, might work. starting recommend third dose people.

EDIT: say employers might require vaccine without exemptions, allow staff wear mask get tested regularly. NYC ""mandate"" allows people decline vaccine, must get tested weekly, must also wear mask.  aren’t lot testing, therefore, surge almost done. Whatever. sounds like wishful thinking.  There's nothing new vaccine mandate. Israel study says vaccine immunity fades 6 months

One study. One Look much virus mutated short amount time

Like every vaccine efficacy variants much much lower original strain covid.

No, not. lower much. Indeed - ALMOST everybody still wearing mask shopping, staying fuck away people.

Loads shops also still making people queue door (in heat well). really weird, much seemed change 19th July, except 20 friends round watch F1. Six days now. Savannah Provincetown reinstated mask mandates Yes, one toughest unlike others great result end allowing normal life return, outside incredibly short lockdowns.

As protesters actually angry vaccine rollout wanting pretend like Covid exist.

And still answer question meant now. see people say vaccinate more. know that. Thanks asking. 

WHO made mandatory states/regions/countries report data every day. Sweden reporting data 4 days week screwed OWID others. 29173 24950 14% drop

31795 29173 8% drop  pandemic declared point. Enough ppl vaxed. Lets focus economy china Discussion thread favor general threads leaned towards skepticism dropping mandate.  good news indeed. Also mentioned days sub Netherlands seeing drastic drops cases well. We'll see Israel week I'm optimistic start peter well soon. entirely accurate...the virus directly infect neurons, infects supporting cells. supporting cells gone, neurons die well. Also, olfactory bulb actually neuroplastic part brain evidenced olfactory training: mean govt massive idiots world class smart people advising science perspective. Maybe found good balance.  count every person born 1984 fair, exactly US handled every aspect pandemic. irrational mess through. Uh…ok Ahh that's good hear. can't say US. states dealing covid differently. I've read NY around 50% antibodies 70% got least one shot. 

Do math states. know, right? CDC would *certainly* make Tennessee seriously consider ~~re~~implementing mask mandate! Schools closed less transmission there, weather absurdly hot week plenty ventilation, Euros noone really cares Olympics.

It's case happens school's go back weather changes... Agreed. LA County, started see uptick month ago, saw first decline positivity rate weekend. one first signs peak near. headline post garbage. I'm sorry, negligent comment. Please educate yourself. Even republican supporter, mean go saying comments like these. know know, say anything learn. live Bergamo. use military trucks dispose bodies, people left dying alone enough beds, deaths march 2020 five times usual. Overblown, really? Come now, know going either Florida Texas. Worst ratio population size shits given pandemic. choice drive drunk, body, one drunk, get freedoms yo! ""There's reason they're pushing hard vaccine, control"" flavor common take YouTube videos related COVID-19 told delta contagious causes milder cases. also Covid health department told I'm debating poster, I'm calling BS others. give downvote too.  Got second today (moderna) - symtoms ever despite told ""likely"" get fewer. 

I went closest bar 4 beers.  ignorant non-mask-believing ""friends"" idea they're *purpose*, ""they point natural downturn evidence 'masks work', keep mandate throughout next fall winter winter spike."" missing point. Thus far, getting vaccinated scientific proof I’ve seen prevents getting sick. Without proof, vaccination personal choice, since vaccine benefits me.

You're missing real simple point disease: Getting vaccinated, cases, prevents infection. infected, contagious. That's HUGE benefit society makes vaccination personal choice. 

For completeness, seen anything definitive contagiousness vaccinated individuals asymptomatic cases mild cases. recall time lot hand waving old Italy's population relative countries.  ok go I'm going say think that's bad idea. think that's bad idea.  I'm sorry total nonsense.

It highly questionable whether federal government authority mandate vaccines all. fact talking vaccine FDA approved muddies waters.

If federal government can't even mandate EUA vaccination members *military*, really think court going uphold general use vaccination mandate? Highly unlikely.

It's even clear whether *states* mandate vaccinations point.

Any would take many many months resolve courts.  wore one everywhere necessary year. Got vaccinated soon could. effective protection vaccine safe enough level risk tolerance. Wearing mask annoying come back, I’ll wear day work. I’m fine taking chances breakthrough case, nearly guaranteed would fine.  anyone else feel socialized talking people online, like reddit? enough socialization feel isolated lol thought Delta vicious? cant talk like here. banned. 

Sweden never enforced kind mask mandate, schools open. economy booming subway hear tourists swedes.

Good America running maximum would line constant slope. plateauing Qui Bergamo. ptsd sure. I’m vaccinated wear N95. 

Maybe I’m little bit ‘extreme’ I’m surprised I’m minority extreme something could literally kill you. 

Also.. kids 12 vaccinated variants proven harmful them. Resulting hospitalization death potentially longcovid even mild symptoms. 

Vaccines also show less effective seniors weaker immunity. Maybe western culture thought someone we’d better situation. think it’s direct result Facebook scrolling past 10 years. big difference removal masks nightclubs opening. difference step 2 3 much significant. Many people still choose wear masks also. 

This could actually over.  rember right, church city use military trucks dispose bodies. 76% population first shot!  Plenty bars this. ever bar? certainly taking cocktail back house. work area adjacent this, worth seem finding online purposeful interest-based activities like dad far rewarding virtual contact goes, rather aimlessly calling people. still everyone, subset older people appears helpful.

People hate truth. even someone sub recently point vaccine doesn’t provide immunity, lessens effect get Covid. 

I don’t understand people won’t talk really happening. number breakthrough cases sky rocketing vaccinated people don’t give fuck that. think vaccinated bullet proof probably spreading shit place. 

So frustrating. sub talk anything anti Vax. want talk actually happening there. Ugh. almost given actually talking real shit. husbands mom. due come September cancel (I need call tell - she’s going devastated). coming 10 days doesn’t make sense spend 14 days somewhere else; also, financially it’s possible it’s additional risk. catches covid plane intermediate destination, she’s intermediate destination, US? Adding extra stops along way would actually increase covid risk. sure Manhattan completely false. Offices bars restaurants opening/fully open everyone mask-less types places. Says guy goofing reddit 2:30 afternoon. doubt trouble finding time.  Agreed think he's saying Biden won, Democrats trust vaccine Republican don't, opposite would true Trump won. shred evidence that, course. absolutely true, vax'd people becoming positive, positive spread virus.  vaccine making symptoms less severe part virus still spread either way. someone doesn’t understand sarcasm almost feels like people celebrating/relishing idea going back restriction turmoil.

There word types, word triggers automods now. Lol. I’m curious, I’ve vaccinated since back February point going public pretty much everyday since…..I wonder many times I’ve exposed covid.

I'd much rather roll dice adding natural immunity (likely minimally problematic) breakthrough infection vaccinated raw-dogging it.

I disagree take matter though. Trying make lives ""miserable"" gonna make revolt even more. already happening parts Europe.  don’t really see problem letting unvaccinated want least domestically. vaccines available still don’t want that’s deal. vaccinated little fear let want get sick die bring virus home it’s w.e. made choice. background cases essentially level last year, NPIs trash, variant easily spread, still unable vaccinated, elementary-age children *are worse every respect point 2020*, yet seems question going back 100% in-person.

I think 1/5000 great odds, even though I'm high risk group. everyone agrees. really stupid shifted something safer (J&amp;J, AZ age/gender) people feel safer taking it. Imagine moment car, even drivers license.  There's way would take 5 minutes.  And, yea, imagine work 7 days week, that's way afford rent utilities jobs pay minimum wage.  

You even 5 minutes, let alone half-a-day would take get bus, ride doctor, fill paperwork related insurance, get shot, wait side effects, wait bus again, ride home. shop target wal-mart. shop groceries dollar stores. There's vaccine dollar store.

At time, it’s unmitigated disaster policy perspective. benefits anti-mask/anti-vax crowd there’s enforcement “vax = mask needed” bit. That, piled top variant strains currently circulating (which ridiculously contagious require masks even vaccinated persons) means need go back masking general, might even need go back enforced closures.

They a) tied relaxation mandates local % vaccinated rather making individual thing, b) explicitly made contingent numbers stay control, c) tested local level making national policy. 

I can’t help feel like screwed one up. good question. friend mine got covid Feb. pregnant (before vaccines available). 

She going wait get vaccinated baby born, doctor monitored covid antibodies gone 2 months. say still some/full immunity cells.

Due lack antibodies chose get vaccinated pregnant. problems vaccine baby born without complications summer. doomsayers said Euros would cause huge surge need see shrink. terms news coverage (at least west) see ending abruptly like news stories cycles. still much us, many dying, long time least media stop focusing vast majority people say it’s “over”. suspect they've seen something data presented far made move statistical goalposts. 

It's likely myocarditis cases popped teenage males, around 15 per million full vaccine courses. risk-benefit ratio vaccinating much younger kids little different, want proceed carefully catch similarly rare effects. Oh god please let normal Cali. doubt that's going make much difference tbh. That's done. ""natural"" way mass disease death. couple days ago. article unvaccinated people getting tested vaccinated individuals need test regularly. assume u/Matsciephd proposing unvaccinated people pay tests. San Diego great football town. LA prefers filling USC games. Worked great decades.

Big Brain NFL decided fuck up. see met vaccinated person still caught COVID knocked ass week

that's happened least dozen real-life friends far

wear damn mask, people! would one willing take vaccine trump pressured FDA approve agency ready? That's gist it. Y’all, nobody took first two weeks seriously enough, meaning we’re still ~16 months later, ridin’ covid-19 merry-go-round. Every week Taco Tuesday true. Adults vaccinated. risk people vaccinated. large, kids risk serious illness. since adults vaccinated risk much lower last year. Virtual learning viable option young kids. Interesting graphic breakthrough cases front page reddit
: verify numbers) Vaccinate risk groups. maybe 30% given population. get 30% reduction deaths hospitalizations, get like 90% effect. 

The hospital systems SE US overwhelmed disease burden 10 20 fold higher winter now. risk groups vaccinated. made majority severe disease requiring hospitalizations. would Healthcare systems collapse now?

 Vaccines reduce death, severe disease, hospitalization (injury, put it), exactly vaccinated vulnerable to? sniffles?  Good. shame could never even 2 weeks... really making antivaxxer life hell addition this.

To fair, that’s virus trying do.  typically cry rage visiting sub. Thanks much giving laugh. That's brilliant.  Biden Putin's puppet /s Imagine sad life must antivax whole quirk lifestyle even, like damn feel sorry thing stand absolutely reason value society Florida run wouldn’t even surprised made mandatory everyone *get* COVID. downvoted? - weird. fact - domestic passports fucked up. Yep. met business partners Europe hit Cancun way in. good tourism stimulus, helpful anyway Covid. Delta community spread here, game already. 

By time know variant already  presume vaccinated anti-mask crowd dangerous unvaccinated mask wearing crowd

You're basically saying mask better prevention vaccine, supported scientific data. fact, scientific data would indicate opposite true. hospital need police force? get tested returning US international trip (fully vaccinated) test cost $50. Since chose travel internationally government foot bill. Even kind shared cost arrangement would big incentive get vaccinated. agree decision, think gives vaccinated people false sense security

Delta proving spread easily vaccinated vaccinated people... everyone still wearing mask, especially indoors  Still favor. Vaccines turn mountain cases molehill deaths. look UK.  great method theory, fails take account (the rare real) people **can't** take vaccine. Whether that's due immunocompromised, allergic ingredients, legitimate health reasons.  


The greater dire thing take account carries significant risk allowing mutations virus spiral something beyond control current vaccines. enough unvaccinated people domestically abroad, real threat got shot mean we're woods yet. Delta variant crazy even vaccinated getting infected.

But vaccine working, suffer little effects it’s really big deal vaccinated. I’m frustrated media keeps playing vaccinated people simply test positive reporting driving vaccine hesitancy. point response. 

I’m saying possible DONT know point could probably get vaccine lemonade stand Timbuktu. 

The fact you’re even posting sub tells absolutely know information. good protection *(or better protection)*

This new concern. virus mutates way natural immunity protects vaccine immunity not? possibility?

The social/political fallout would absolutely insane. smart. Everyone get vaccinated, care much getting one, week damn annoying. Yes get that... sarcasm. …how would dose mRNA two AZ even help, though, given places don’t accept two AZ also, large, wouldn’t accept AZ/mRNA mix? prior current actions suggest FDA gives little weight popular sentiment.

If did, would suggest they'd probably move faster slightly less cautiously.

I suspect they've seen something data presented far made move statistical goalposts. Fucking thank brilliant expert former New Yorker, username gave away you’re from. currently way definitively diagnosing ""Long Covid""?  move Insurance covers stupid covers smart, fortunately millions. real consequences unvaccinated potential death. move  supposed sympathy man?? denmark today, Im glad. 70% started first vaccine. great number aswell. Good you, good us good world. course, Italy Mafia. almost tears laughing scene every time. hurts much scene reminds dad trying teach drive. Oh worried hurting feelings all, lol

France made rule can't go restaurants, museums, etc. without vaccinated negative PCR test longer free. happier this.

What mean is, want worries, okay not, consequences: stay home meet anyone. problem starts fuckers want whatever want, including infecting others, pretext freedom little belief science. … think HIV spread?

If I’m sleeping someone, I’m pretty sure want make sure they’re HIV negative undetectable. I’ll still use condom.  feel like we’re constantly getting confused this. true SARS-CoV-2 endemic us form forever, mitigation intervention efforts reduce transmission levels low enough longer qualifies pandemic. world shot, narrow one, eliminating became pandemic likelihood would disappear completely essentially zero. 

When vaccine induced immunity natural infection immunity reach certain level, transmission virus become sufficiently difficult probably produce seasonal spikes infections, possibly boosters. That’s literally flu, live fine. 

To get level, quit complaining seeing BTS person damn part. Get vaxxed. Wear mask. Don’t dick. Sacrifice neighbor. Make informed decisions. Stop following cult leaders. That’s pandemic ends. nation’s shitty parents demands free babysitter back

People work become homeless starve. shitty parents problem, shitty government paying parents stay home problem.

I agree schools in-person kids vaccinated herd immunity levels can't blame parents difficulty kids schooling home. Australia fucking bad vaccinating population. lockdown every case did. ""zero COVID"" policy unrealistic.  wife one people who’s stuck country. got rid house, apartment, sold everything own, gave notice jobs leaving - hired replacements. got permanent residency visa could get country cancelled flight. We’re stranded wife’s green card expiring December visa expiring February. spent money right we’re stranded. flights prohibitively expensive. Buying new flight tonight hoping get chance get there. third attempt it’s getting expensive stressful. Unfortunately protest +refusal get vaccinated , + variants, appears endless cycle. really crazy world.  I'm surprised, red county near get sorts looks wearing mask, often one wearing store there, even unvaccinated overweight diabetics wear masks, usually, right across county line substantial minority people still wear them.

I must confess I've went several times stores without mask, letting peer pressure get me. Morrison partly blame criticised lock downs initially thought could political damage State Premier opposite party. I’m becoming increasingly convinced labeled terrorist organization (at least ones spread false information push narrative) “Nearly 163 million people, 49% eligible U.S. population, vaccinated, according CDC data.”

49% fully vaccinated? 49% include fully vaccinated got one dose? it’s latter, many fully vaccinated many gotten one dose? would enough motivation me. never stopped wearing mask mandate ended two reasons: 1. don’t need government tell right thing and, much like last point slightly different, 2. one told “Smile!” since early 2020, like that. distinctly remember getting debates getting downvoted pointing vaccines highly efficacious, viral spread great enough develop mutations decrease efficacy. way works. general biology stuff.

I fear monger understand science (ironic considering I'm biologist)...now got Delta vaccine efficacy indeed took hit. People wanted feels reals wanted banger 2021 summer pandemic behind us. did... Fauci default thumbnail every NYT covid article something? hard read one linked? Somebody tell Australia   dare you! Don’t forget guardian put antibodies wane drastically 10wks post see much asymptomatic spread future especially travel opening Well done ashamed previously misunderstood something, happy corrected! personally love corrected stops wrong next time, think fall minority!

That said, please ever say ""Eckcetera"" I'll ridicule ;-) 40's get AZ vaccine speaking GP. People need start personally suing anti-mask officials harm. Looks like someone didn’t click link   Same. I’ve struggled OCD depression past year (before too, gotten way worse). gotten compounded trauma frontline worker contending suicidal thoughts several months. couple good months there, I’m falling back bad habits hard, overall mood taking really scary/dangerous hit.

I wear N95/FFP2 kind seal nose (3M Aura) type mask fog glasses like crazy. Surgical masks worst, fog glasses even cloth masks.

Will continue wearing even 2nd shot fully kicked reason alone. I’m fascinated stories people say long Covid symptoms east even eliminated got vaccine. Oh no. heard statistic yet. remember eyes bugging read stat black people cuz kid half black. Holding breath, praying dad whole side family makes ok. wish knew could mitigate whatever causing increased risk possible. Okay also going extent needing ID everything, throw voting well. Can’t bring ID, cant vote. look Israel’s data, surge breakthrough infections correlates recent Delta surge. Also, controlled age saw similar increase infections amongst younger people vaccinated early older demographics overall. 

Question is: waning immunity, also speak different immunological response based vaccine spacing? UK Canada, two nations notably different results vaccine studies, dosed Pfizer weeks apart. Sometimes much months apart. It’s theorized could lead stronger immunological response. Israel lot people got second doses December, January, February March 6+ months fully vaccinated. see vaccine efficacy decrease month month. hope get chance compare UK/Canada’s numbers larger cohort 6+ months past full vaxxed. immunity doesn’t wane, like Israel’s data shows, would strong evidence superiority larger dose gap, instead label 21 days. ACA allows discrimination based age, location, gender smoking status IIRC. factors forbidden. use Israel's 39% vaccine efficacy rate, delta 60% transmissible, mean vaccinated people spread delta efficiently unvaccinated people spread original virus?  troll. post history gong show haha far deaths go (putting aside complicated world impacts) COVID worse flu seasons kids, actually fares “better” many (e.g. H1N1)

It’s hoax become extremely ill. go straight hospital. Yeah I’ve heard lot healthcare workers getting issued shitty surgical masks allowed wear anything weren’t issued, sounds like “save good stuff healthcare people” weird lie lot cases. 

Good instincts though, CDC tells something nice you, that’s going thing want. obsess every little development, wring hands possibility long haul symptoms, change reality? I'm too. death, 65. 

We really back year ago  would suit ""dicknose"" types.. Debbie vs Dallas. Debbie vs all. One going multiple VHS tapes. Freedom Face Flag. *grammer Israeli media pipeline covid misinformation since beginning pandemic. Every days another outlandish claim. see data US, UK, EU, etc., take anything coming worth two sh*ts. in:

Man, real zombie apocalypse, would people attended zombie parties could purposely get infected. Take reasonable precautions. Get back living life.  Adding cost testing reduce likely hood identifying positive cases. People minor symptoms would normally willing get tested would longer willing could spread further. mean, there’s two answers that. Smart people see is, political economic move that’s gambling every elementary schooler country nation’s shitty parents demands free babysitter back.

Most people going look think “well must pretty normal safe kids wear masks school, wouldn’t way dangerous,” gladly throw kids plague pits.

Either way, kids lose. Vaccinated people still catch Covid spread it. Children immune compromised can't get vaccine. I'm concerned people eligible otherwise refuse get vaccine. think fair right dehumanize unvaccinated folks. children reported less severe symptoms. still learning disease long term effects lot parents feel good subjecting kids disease could effect rest lives. 

This ignoring potential covid mutating less resistant vaccines well. spoke concern variants time last year told worry mutation rate low likely going evolve something less deadly.

Ive accepted it, get sick, happens, i'm moving life.

Personally think best interest especially can't get vaccinated, government tries everything get vaccination rate high. protection herd immunity, want stay home time wear masks everywhere forever. Thing though, I'm going carefree summer.

On couch.

***Doing everyone done back lockdown started.*** saying people infected fully vaxxed?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  many comments people refusing wear masks protect unvaccinated. Please keep mind lot us ineligible vaccine due anaphylaxis, mast cell issues, autoimmune issues, more. want vaccinated badly doctors refuse. Wearing mask grocery store much protect life? That's like place go. Give break. 

Please consider calming wearing mask essential places ineligible people choice going.  also prefer try incentivizing authoritarian tactics deployed. go better. isn’t responsive comment—the comment responded suggesting people supported CDC saying masks longer needed people original mask mandate. That’s accurate.

That felt safer continuing wear masks fine choice. it’s really relevant prior comment was. vaccine passports ought fix this. ""I fully vaxxed never got it"" comments practically nonexistant. course, instances happen, people seem comment them. purpose post create optimism show people fully vaccinated people quite protected. ammo super scarce around here. uncle got reloading awhile ago sitting nice supply. 30_06 go evidence  Lol.

But, yeah, right. case, fucking frustrating. Well they're putting lot vaccinations, think right lot people infected radar includes lot people later vaccinated

It interesting see number changes though. recall quite high figure Japan last summer believe fell quite quickly. suppose antibodies one piece immune response though. People caught original SARS still responsive T-cells even  family fully vaxxed gotten COVID. We've going restaurants, movie theaters, sporting events, shopping centers fine.

Cloth surgical masks okay job protecting others infected stopping biggest droplets slowing deflecting smaller ones, don’t much anything protect you. vaccine? Yikes Yeah, thought implied. idea all. think idea terms trend what’s going UK Israel.

Lie must ain't flu.
Delta bad whatever comes worse. Delta projections fairly frequently far out. real scientific evidence behind statement seems ""burn out"" faster previous variants, guess makes sense since spreads much faster. Yeah, take steroids whatever performance enhancing drug can’t detected Olympic officials won’t take vaccine prevent possibility training nothing caught Covid. Yes - me, best seal. poop gas station bathroom day couldn’t smell gas station poop Spoiler alert: won’t happen. Anything Biden tries stop this, GOP turns **every. Fucking. TIME.** Even then, Biden already said vaccine passports aren’t happening, period. issue set precedent give people money everytime need vaccine, something that, realistically, might able follow on. also risk confirming conspiracy nuts government desperate pay people get vaccinated. People suggesting since vaccine announced like idea think drawbacks consider. ""I fully vaxxed got COVID!"" comments going stand lot ""I fully vaxxed never got it"" comments. Breakthrough cases small percentage vaccinated population. huge variety antibiotics fight bacterial infections, nowhere near success developing equivalent viral infections. problem lies fact bacteria definitely alive, viruses barely considered alive. Viruses can’t even reproduce themselves, highjack cells purpose. It’s hard kill something that’s barely even life form.  
It’s much easier develop vaccine, basically provides immune system ”wanted poster” virus let immune system it’s thing. Vaccines simple, medicines hard. fast idea vaccination 200 years old. even predates Germ Theory medicine. Fitting masks isn’t hand crafting them.

It’s testing acceptable fit process.

When get fitted typically several models sizes. look judge think best you, put one one you, help adjust it, put whole head bag spray test sprays see components smell.

Doing basic seal test described various masks’ literature nearly good test.

But things help wear strictly, check make sure you’ve got solidly place, careful touching frequently.  Nope, end enough unvaccinated get infected build antibodies. boss want ask? decide police it? That's interesting, first I've heard that. translated version FDA guaranteed, however, ten million doses distributed Brazil countries like Colombia South Africa safe - already highlighted Minister Health, Marcelo Queiroga. bunch work (individually wrapped) comfortable n95s I’ve worn.  Yeah would like see data, instead data, lol. 

Also, I’m sure masks prevalent UK schools.  got box 100 NIOSH N95 masks approved medical use costco $80 recently, I'm sure sale still going on. 90% adults UK. lot people want vaccinated ineligible (I'm one them).

Otoh, come week might get cases go higher, projected. probably better time two weeks now. 

And don’t worry baseball. cards aren’t hot. Welcome club, pal Based what? People care Australia much Great, I'll upgrade N95.

Will CDC reimbursing costs? Also, *maybe* coming better treatment, medically societally/economically, people get long-term disabled COVID going stick us. need arise

Why would need vaccinated people wear masks arise? law one tool tool kit! 

Australia planning use vaccines, also obviously using things well, whereas US gone all-in vaccines basically little else plans anything else. think that's risky short-sighted. Already cancels wedding fall last year fuck let’s get married zoom call guess. Like lot people I've pulled back COVID news rabbit hole Delta news, I'm despair.

I live Ontario, probably locked-down place entire continent, see cases rising (as places already Delta wave) likely we'll wind rolling back even modest amount reopening did.

It gives horrible flashbacks summer 2020, living downtown Toronto, knew nothing would enough stop wave eventually came. Masks? Contact tracing? Zero COVID possible (something like possible Atlantic Canada, luck, virtue) going get hit wave time neighbours do, delaying reopening help. takes away time people enjoy lives wave hits. happening again.

My point view pessimistic, guess. think people think anyone suppress COVID over-optimistic people think go away own. Every pre-2020 pandemic plan called keeping life normal possible part restrictions get less effective time, morale drops, anything left fight big waves. threw away adopted unprecedented idea throw everything soon can. Lockdowns even mask mandates saved things worst, like 1918 (the way people talk think restrictions years; weeks like it).

I went back forth whether agree Sweden. one hand, much worse neighbours, assume something wrong. hand, policy actually hard-line I'd like (e.g. banning gatherings 50: much worse pandemics, one thought OK wipe live entertainment indefinitely).

But think people understand Sweden's policy come place optimism. place extreme pessimism: going years, restrictions make people miserable. Whereas Ontario many places adopted idea make people miserable now, everything fine later. course that's true never thought true. Misery leads misery later. entire season last year vaccines. think would consider preventing unvaccinated players playing season? Cross posting [this here. anyone fully vaccinated, exposed someone tested positive gotten COVID? I've hearing breakthrough cases, curious abou success stories. 

Me family fully vaxxed going restaurants, sporting events, movie theaters, shopping centers fine. Everyone know gotten COVID right unvaccinated. I'm person talking before. I've proposed nothing. respect people decide something someone says it. toddlers? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thing QR code confirms vaccination used everyone. connected name, doubt people look hard. 

I vaxxed already, hope anything... individual within past week claimed Israel counts covid19 survivors fully ""vaccinated"". Without actually getting shot vaccine. anyone else heard read ? Could seeing vaccine efficacy waning? paper ""vaccinated"" getting reinfected again? asked information, never heard back person. One factor I've seen UK least (where Delta rampant) older people vaccinated (90% age groups) lot 50s aren't, younger age groups catching survival rates better, necessarily less deadly variant different patient profile better outcome. fucking frustrating. really looking forward summer actually shit again, want go anywhere concern infection. true many, many facets COVID. There’s little comparison typical levels things would someone ‘standard’ cold.  study suggests people vaccinated January 16% efficacy contracting symptomatic covid reduction efficacy hospitalizations terrifying. Even Israel first country major vaccine rollout 39% population vaccinated January numbers OECDs less 10%. hope outlier incorrect fall going nightmare. Also teen got vaccine:

Teens eligible Pfizer vaccine; user either lying mistakenly given Moderna vaccine. Moderna approved FDA eighteen older.

Also, pediatric patients, COVID death hospitalization exceptionally rare, sitting 0.01% 0.8%, respectively, child contracts COVID-19; it’s “hard-hitting” means. said, isn’t pass immunized; herd immunity valuable.

As persuasion, figure she’s hesitant. Reassure her, haven’t gotten one yourself, so. People often become less hesitant vaccines know loved ones received turned fine. kid 5 asked shots 5 year old checkup. said shots day turned 11. go there. agree. area high vax rate people masked indoors. think there's correlation there. medical straits due going doctor. Waiting insurance company approve abdominal pelvic CT scans week. Haven’t Dr since pandemic. It’s hard compare SARS1 epidemic SARS2. totally different scale. There’s many documented cases SARS-Cov-2 reinfection, don’t know there’s even one documented case SARS1 survivor catching again.

I wish comparable US data comparing Pfizer Moderna. find theory (backed evidence) bigger space prime first dose elicits stronger immune response, compelling. theorized evidence waning immunity. could partially explain huge discrepancy UK Israeli data, besides fact people gotten fully vaxxed UK way recently. US went “on label” Pfizer Moderna. Moderna 28 day dose spacing also active ingredient Pfizer.

Israeli’s research compelling either way. think people comparable vaccine status (received 2nd Pfizer 21 days prime, January-March) take precautions knowing it’s quite likely immunity significantly decreased. Many Americans fucking stupid then. Please make so. thoughtful solution Maybe we'll carefree summer next year. Maybe. west coast epicenter aids pandemic they’ve before. First, security theater, technically?

I think best definition ""doing something little benefit order pretend like something fight threat"".

They clearly said specifically cloth masks effective, N95s are.  total failure Morrison Government.
They spent billions fattening bank accounts business cronies awarding contracts can’t get overseas Australians home safe.
The quarantine centres built last year flights chartered overseas Australians get home support payment made available people stuck overseas unable get back due Morrison’s lack leadership.
We money waste billions dollars crappy French contacted subs.
The quarantine centres built like one Alice springs could used extra housing post pandemic would waste.
We need social housing anyway. Obesity big factor. enough vitamin too. Don’t tell sub that. want lock US instead encouraging vaccinations. masks ever toted frontline defense. data sides unless everyone's wearing N95, cloth ones fairly useless.

Citation please, studies seen say themes quite effective. Ah, course, joking lol going happen. may actual mandate private sector level, rules regarding unvaccinated people can/can't do, sit, conduct business, attend live events, etc. can't let refuse right thing continue bog things make virus worse. starts hurting economy, will, see hardline stances vaccination requirements. mean, problem is, mask mandates without restrictions kinda useless. Like yeah, *some effect*. much. still data available prevalence long covid people vaccinated. probably get another Covid vaccine.

Edit: Also, I'm glad ok!

Edit2: [CDC says ask buy Home Depot Lowes US. it’s approved kids, leaves immunocompromised people can’t get vaccine. many people like there? know it’s shitty position, didn’t alter lives keep safe COVID, would now? Yeah think either. proposing think would actually done make people it. ""I'm glad we're going many dead [REDACTED] voters, make *so* much easier rig *next* election! Oops, say loud?"" polio scarier? Covid awful disease kills lot people makes lot people sick long term effects even fully understand yet. way polio scarier trump friends downplayed covid gains. society living gone back normal life people

In 1918, last massive flu epidemic, population US hundred million unvaccinated people, apparently plenty keep raging epidemic going. Right now, twice many unvaccinated people US, plus number vaccinated people unknown level infection, hopefully low. 50 million unvaccinated kids 12 country right now.

Cases doubling every week two last month (check post sub updates). obviously going another spike. know decent number democrats anti-vax  That's bullshit say cover fact they're afraid get little vaccine. He's admitted patient zero flub haunts day entire career since effort make amends it, even though team issue Republicans latched onto it. 80 cents? area (NYC). get surgical masks price. Ebay Amazon filled scalpers. pretty sad atm DC probably among first places backpedal lifting mask mandate

100% agree. Anyone downvotes either a) denial b) DC area know anything it.

Naw man, that’s idoitic. it’s enough infect you, there’s enough viral load pass someone else, otherwise wouldn’t symptoms, vaccinated not. It’s simply numbers game. think you’re confusing two ideas here. treat way propose, won’t get vaccinated…   view people disagree morons insane. 

Also you’ve failed respond point- rhetoric going 60% people unvaccinated. Man, really sucks! I’m sorry crazy folks like that. vaccines get full FDA approval, military almost certainly mandate them. Dozens vaccines already required service members, added pile. hope federal employees mandated, don’t know Joe Biden’s got balls that. does, might spark wave businesses mandating it, would great mean, government could also just…not impose mandates? solution give governments power mandate vaccines, threat government also using power restrict people’s lives? Reddit pro-futurology, pro-new-tech. that's is. brand new future. like that. Kids America dying. many school years going rob children? believe schools made safe children learn get Covid. However don’t trust school administration actually things would make school safe. don’t think funding, certainly don’t correct ventilation space 80 100 year old buildings, superintendent tendency say things later proved untrue. article direct quote Fauci vaccinations US so…yeah course they’re going use picture. people get vaccinated situation improve. you’re fence, you’re moron. That’s is. can’t whine demand everybody treat like viewpoint good real viewpoint expect results, it’s not. This. understand everyone obsessing masks, distancing, potential lockdowns again. We're getting close 70% adults 1 shot mark. need convince least half remaining \~30% get vaccine. That's it. masks, distancing, definitely lockdowns. everything get holdouts vaxxed, beyond they're they're gotten now. Agreed, obese people smokers well! majority Redditors introverted, high-paid WFH software engineers could operate way doing, rest lives. Staying home, luxury groceries delivered/ordering GrubHub UberEats every night, etc.  someone please share text article? Even March? understanding time less open season shots Israel. There’s noticeable drop April March (and drops Feb, Jan, etc.) Oh see thank you. Again, acting like (a) somehow free choice one way (b) weirdly favor perpetual rampant virus lockdown. 

I idea why. post locked repeated rule-breaking comments. Please take time review [sub Anybody understand point thr U.S. split two diametrically opposite camps, one side actively opposed preventive public health measures aimed curbing COVID either coma last 18 months, they're tuned current events messaging matter anyway. It’s probably 50/50. live California, there’s shitload people make around six figures, still completely insane comes COVID lost taste smell COVID terrifying 

Yep. terryfing since severe depression food one things give pleasure anymore. official Israeli study controlled age, waning efficacy seen across age groups. I've said I'll say here: Conservatives understand nuance understand changing opinion acknowledge new information. nothing pick stance stick forever even becomes obvious wrong hypocrite. number people know recently infected, infected covid 2nd time, primary complaints bad diarrhea ongoing lower back pain. infected 2nd time say headache started base skull days prior additional symptoms. Nah China. Whether lab nature, gave us lovely gift Rona. tested PCR test (material nasal/throat swab amplified via thermal cycling virus detected), rather antibody test (a blood sample taken tested antibodies targeting SARS-CoV-2 spike protein). False positives rare. waning effect still controlling age. also see real step efficacy month month. It’s cool granular data is. recommending masking day one missed opportunity lifetime.

The best chance making mea culpa speech Trump infected survived due extraordinary measures. bleach injections UV light skin.

Saying wrong, wanted make it, save many lives possible, second chance, would incredible gesture. Alas, nothing sort happened.  Peer reviewed study shown zinc one effective supplement reducing duration common cold taken near time infection; overall, thought boost immune response. Note take zinc supplements long-term though, cause issues. Part due higher underlying disease (blacks higher rates hypertension, CVD, type 2 diabetes on), higher exposure rates due jobs (more blacks work customer-facing jobs like stores restaurants), income levels relate health insurance (fewer blacks quality private health insurance). 

Simply put, people live communities color tend work lower income jobs person instead WFH, provide low wages health insurance. Pair higher rates chronic disease … well, we’re left sadly.

Especially ones get pandemic news Facebook anti vacc groups. really grinds gears somehow.  I’m actually curious now. North Carolina 6 weeks ago came back pretty bad stomach/diarrhea bad lower back pain extent started seeing chiropractor. fully vaccinated, didn’t seem related covid far knew, comment makes think now, especially given one NC wore mask. 

My wife daughter got fairly sick well, however tested covid tested negative, could’ve anything. bet India. delta came India. come amount? would generally think case term “et al” “others” referring associates named party. So, narrow set versus “all”. thought process this. saw simple protective measure bought tons N95s, assuming would soon available. actively discouraged (especially ones valves) focus protecting people. year later idiots saying “wear two masks” instead 🤦‍♂️ Got vaxxed January high risk. Lovely news! vacation coming 3 weeks 🤦🏻‍♀️ God, would like Polio 2.0... delayed fuckyouup edition. fully vaccinated person catching COVID-19 like dog biting man. interesting. fully vaccinated person catching COVID-19 like man biting dog. interesting. Oh, it'll absolutely require CDC shift messaging happens, get wrong there.

I feel like Bowser waiting that. Fuck disease everybody continues perpetuate it. got shots 2 months ago. one drain society. Simple that. feel best way full-online school learning Zoom. government would absolutely contract develop video conferencing program would ensure people cannot turn cameras class time ensure students *actually* pay attention instead half-assing it. ~~Be brave!~~  point, I’m either positive negative enforcement. Pay people get punish don’t. something. lockdowns, mask mandates much different. True lol Maybe reason don’t based personal experience adverse side effects, concerns medical failures previous mistakes. They’re wrong, doesn’t make morons. Pro forced birth, own, good luck get fucked. Thank sharing positive story! much fear mongering going felt getting paranoid :( stay healthy! everyone move on. 

This depressingly common attitude. took hours last night morning. Groups high rates diabetes. Local mandates. alone. kids young vaccinated &amp; one medically complex. immune system fucked up. 

I want over. want another semester (or another year...) homeschool/virtual learning choice have? bad cold lands hospital; might survive covid. Yeah, people sub seem include number people bought certain ideas. masks useless without physical distancing

They're useless, they're effective.

A fully-packed club everyone masking properly effective club 50% capacity limit everyone masking properly. Maybe could raffle groups tickets home LSU Saints games vaccinated people.

Let groups 5 register, one person wins 5 get home tickets game.

100,000 seats per 7 home games LSU.
70,000 seats Super Done 8 home games.

Tickets 1.26 million fans. know stands full 100% vaxxed people


And let stadiums get full concession sales. Local governments eat concession fees would earned. getting much fans allowed. “Mr. Davidovitch said data based hundreds cases considered preliminary.”

“The ministry said latest data might biased coronavirus tests conducted. Many carried areas outbreaks among elderly, small number tests conducted among younger people vaccinated. Older Israelis first vaccinated; many fully inoculated end January currently make cases severe illness.”

I’m saying ignore data completely, far small sample size, disproportionately looked susceptible disease average population. Even claim it’s 91% effective preventing severe illness, means vaccinated aren’t overwhelming healthcare systems dying significant It’s delta. Indonesia unfortunately isn’t well equipped seriously get it. strategy here? trying do? show things still bad Biden president? clear preventable deaths.

Also, lot difficult time-consuming verify someone's vaccine paperwork see wearing mask. would take full-time person standing door carefully checking everyone's paperwork. hand, see someone's wearing mask 20 ft away, people see too, creating possibility social expectations pressure. actually one good things masks. Different varient, no? continue infect us trying protect ourselves. *If compromise incredible vaccines have, even want contemplate world would look like
Dr Aris Katzourakis*

If vaccines stop working think people would start go insane large numbers. People can't take living like much longer... lasted long hope vaccines. 

If remove hope, shit going go nuts there. there's might covid least newer variants dangerous younger peeps thought data comes in. Fair enough, mean downplay either. know neurological damage worst kind injury have. Well makes country look bad unlimited supply vaccines yet covid control. begged begged cure. desperate find started making shit hydroxychloroquine — refused acknowledge wasn’t enough research prove actually helped. (Turns out: didn’t.)

Now there’s actual “cure.” It’s incredibly effective safe. (And mention, it’s free!) won’t fucking take it. common reason not? “It’s tested enough.” 

I’m fed up. protect can't get vaccine medical conditions high risk children? Ok. live Alabama vaccinating healthcare professional.

Ivey really done much promote vaccines I've heard every ridiculous excuse book one.

She's said people common sense. don't.

She's said stop blaming ""regular folks"" blame unvaccinated, ""regular folks"" *are* unvaccinated ones.  Something went around house couple weeks, 4 us came something totally different times. 

I fever lasted 16 hours 4th felt fine. trip Branson, MO planned early September. Missouri #1 cases right now. haven’t vacation 4 years looking forward get town get house since don’t go much. I’m worried we’re gonna cancel trip postpone vacation another year. Sucks Kids dying States. news listening to? Several sources one? Children's hospital capacity state. Two died many put vents week. fall get rough. Doctors going make hard calls upon triage. can't understand happened India Indonesia, simply this--their healthcare overwhelmed looks like 1918 COVID wards. begun here. hope remain safe. hope that's case Australia home next covid super variant really did? I’m familiar history I’m sure that’s things happened. True. Hopefully abundantly clear risk Delta variant real vaccines safe effective. 

Hoping rate keeps going up. Project N95 sells kn95 masks - nonprofit buying bulk direr suppliers. decided skip Amazon due crappy controls unknown probability getting junk

Not affiliated any, happy customer. Insurance premiums absolutely higher folks US engage risky behaviors. course anyone could seen coming. likely people wear masks situation people vaccinated. never said vaccinated could take masks. say would much better without Fauci. beginning said wear masks. said take off.  excuse masks vaccine available. everyone risk get vaccine (in U.S.), totally understand frustration resentment among vaccinated would asked undergo kind inconvenience service refuse vaccine. 

Frankly, share it. I'll consider wearing mask credible information comes along serious health risks vaccinated new variant others appear line. say, I'll wear mask benefit vaccinated individuals. I'm going wear one reduce risk deny science refuse help themselves. Yeah, discussed much, seem lot overlap people Trump people taking various sides covid pandemic issues. already divided warring tribes media Trump's administration, tribes smoothly taken issues kept fight going even though Trump gone. Even perfect flu vaccine, get rid entirely birds pigs reservoirs disease. eliminate birds pigs humans simultaneously actually get rid flu would basically impossible given fast mutates. So, animals act reservoirs really determines truly get rid covid not. Yeah see anything stopping now. see restrictions reimposed. vaccine. point vaccine things can't stay open. People make choices safety. wear mask indoors eat indoor restaurants even though vaccinated. one going shut anything back down. We’re fucked Agree triage complex process utilitarian goal. example, would appropriately using ""regular triage."" Admitting treating unvaccinated patient would maximize overall survival, goal triage. Outdoor seating spaced tables would work too. Staff would risk though. Calm Tina Belcher. sound like fucking asshole typing up

First, recognizing acknowledging death isn’t metric gauge children’s safety regards virus. 

Secondly, recognizing acknowledging can’t compare flu. Especially considering flu vaccine children. 

Thirdly, recognizing acknowledging children completely unprotected, neeed take seriously, could suffer long-term problems, also they’re carriers contribute virus mutation course spread. Southern California isnt :( think following link straightforward answer question, hopefully might lead right answer:  

COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Infections Reported CDC — United States, January 1–April 30, 2021: 
      total 10,262 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine breakthrough infections reported 46 U.S. states territories April 30, 2021. 
   April 30, 2021, approximately 101 million persons United States fully vaccinated COVID-19. 18 lol, teenager. agree rest said. Ugh. “US bad” thing it’s annoying simplify that. no, pretty obvious virus would endemic early on. Well vaccines developed far rolled back mask mandate. top google hits. Good you. sound extremely paranoid. cases, 342 Massachusetts 153 Provincetown residents, according Town Manager Alex Morse. Nearly 70% cases linked cluster among individuals fully vaccinated, three people hospitalized treatment. Yup. Lost smell taste got covid end November. Gained faint sense smell taste mid January. Parosmia since. awful. Sure things considered could worse. never expected lose two major senses let alone 7+ months. I’d never wish anyone. It’s one thing idiot doesn’t follow science, it’s whole thing jerk do. Thank work do. Things back normal. Everything open. Airports packed. Concerts happening. Churches services. Restaurants full capacity. Yeah, think also terrific political economic pressure declare pandemic over. course, everyone loves bearer good news.

I'm saying excuse, explanation. Same. already get credit alpha,  Wow. I'm sorry deal that. Thanks work done far! Curious, part country this? There's house end street put one political-type yard signs saying 'Unmask children'...like really? need know percentage *un*vaccinated carriers infect people public spaces, otherwise statistic bit meaningless

(Symptomatic un-vaccinated carrier 12.8% chance infecting close contact. Asymptomatic 3.5%. Although obviously measuring infections different settings article measuring -  Recall population US 1918 100 million people; seemed plenty people sustain horrific pandemic. 

Right now, twice many unvaccinated people US 1918, lot live big cities population centers lot traveling.

I see reason think things going better now. would thrilled find I'm wrong, though.   I'll give arrows pass popped pretty quickly virus everyone still trying anything everything stop spread. course pretty ignored day one. SK restarts vaccination campaign earnest today till September. cold? virus control 

how propose that? That’s nothing stuff is. waiting vaccine one works incredibly well we’re told that’s good enough. ever good enough?  lockdowns going happen anymore. messaging fallen far rails. way trying implement again. Can’t believe scroll far find reasonable take. CDC fucked every step way wearing mask store fucking easy. FWIW, kids would rather wear mask bring covid home them. Even though less likely would infected I'm vaccinated, kids low likelihood severe disease, mask low-cost mitigation add (especially since I'm area lot increase). You’re obviously troll, I’ll say anyway:
1. COVID real affect. Even doesn’t kill you, killed lot people, disastrous long-term health consequences barely beginning understand. 
2. Even able get COVID long haul issues, could absolutely end giving disease someone vaccinated cannot already sick, young, etc. vaccine you. whole community. 
3. unvaccinated people world likely another variant one could serious consequences larger section population, including yourself. getting vaccinated you’re helping contribute scenario. 

This case either/or. It’s both/and. vaccinate rest world. it’ll go back wear mask walk bar, grab drink don’t need wear one I’m actively drinking lol

Currently FL there’s way anything changes here, I’m moving DC fall (supposedly, new job thinks we’ll office October I’m holding signing lease least weeks cuz fuck paying DC rent we’re still remote) it’ll interesting see deal there.  potentially due different timelines followed countries? UK Canada went longer time doses gamble may paid off. 

To address counties mentioned, data US seems pretty noisy completely ignorant regarding Germany.  insanely touch comment. pandemic bad, humanity gone lot worse. hot ""The beatings continue morale improves""  well said. enforce anything 18 months. voluntary many ignored everything.

We needed 4-6 weeks actual tough enforced restrictions. Instead got 18 months crap.  areas hospitals capacity, danger hitting capacity rising admissions numbers. areas probably mask mandates. justification health care many forms endangered hospital bursting seams. know I'm going get votes. really. people suppose without money? especially hard stuff like Olympics going people interviews without masks etc. messaging screwed. also exposes weak healthcare systems planet. let's lockdown again. Smh. getting ridiculous I've supporter help mitigate mess. Fall Winter going tragic good luck getting people accept it.   appropriating property others? It’s concept maybe doesn’t translate well?

Thanks answer.:) Good stuff. want wear mask, that’s well within personal rights. I’ve COVID I’m vaccinated. won’t wearing mask.   hospitals UK capacity? 5 days decline peak hospitalizations shadow earlier waves.  think recommend getting vaccinated even lot people weak immune system. example doctors say people leukemia get vaccinated. immune response might non existent weak, chance react bit worth getting vaccinated. fucking mask reason believe on/off, lightbulb, thing. pathway, probably spectrum, ""did take enough damage notice it"". 

A mild breakthrough case going similar mild unvaccinated case. need see one kid die MISC secondary mild COVID-19 infection... looking %positive rates UK too, showing marked increase - suggesting significant unmeasured burden. weird. One time heard mom say something diverged slightly views. spoken since. even know say except I'm sorry thank trying. We're fucked. 2 weeks ago. Everyone Athens wearing masks inside metro. Well that's fantastic -- know many people surveyed? make up. Coronavirus vaccines well known need regular boosters. get annual flu shots, example, least lot us do.

Some vaccines pretty much one-and-done (smallpox? measles?), certainly all.

One big research questions long protection covid vaccine going last, whether subsequent boosters going confer level protection not. claim early recipients already seeing reduced levels protection. Others confirmed this. vaccine safest men women? want get vaccinated want make safest choice both.

I've seen Pfizer Women, J&amp;J men bunch stuff. Problem nowadays, everything considered ""misinformation"" idiot government hard find real answers questions. would certainly help. agree many modern jobs need 40hr work week order get full time pay.

It's impossible eat better healthier though. looking obesity rates heart disease population, shot massively past century despite improving work conditions. problem inherently social cultural issue, egged mass marketing unhealthy habits (ex: grabbing breakfast daily McD's instead non-sugary cereal breakfast home).

There's always outliers, *most* Americans time capable leading healthier diets do. Unfortunately hardest part dietary reform beating one's cravings habits, legitimate issue. Thank done. uneducated theory sars-cov-2 able hide immune system people, vaccine creates antibodies finally starts clearing virus them. believe long haulers still virus them, somewhere deep won’t show typical covid test. someone fully vaccinated Pfizer beginning February, I’m liking this. I’m young (28), overweight (though I’m working lifestyle changes improve). clear decrease time, would say US government allow us go grab third shot wanted to. It’s seems like current shot provides great degree protection Delta, it’s rather time weakens it. mild hypochondria anxiety, end six months isn’t boding well me. think priority make Pan Coronavirus vaccine effective measles polio vaccines. could've possibly foreseen honor system abused honor? want peer reviewed science! Thanks :) can't help paranoid haha.. worried year kids last honest. issue less homeschooling shitty parents. Deaths still flat / dropping US. Hospitals simply risk overwhelmed. What's goal exactly? Nobody ever get sick again? Back January, may operative phrase here. Especially received Pfizer. say Moderna’s better, don’t know. Israel strong data Pfizer’s efficacy waning. Numbers January aren’t looking good.  Yup! common folk think could safely vax family. got back last week. hindsight would gone mat masks dropped, managed. selective. 

Dine doors only, tons options especially disney springs. 

Mask inside 100% time outside can't social distance. 

Focus attractions outdoor open air queues seating. indoor attractions last first avoid standing closed spaces extended periods. anything enclosed shows theaters. 

We great time. Wore great masks tested negative upon return (left 10 days ago cleat point) 

Feel free PM answer specific questions. undermine sense safety, I’m currently 10 day quarantine due catching covid 7 year old, got summer camp. Wife fully vaccinated, caught (including 2 children), despite trying isolate son (as well isolate young child) wearing masks home. 

Nobody got bad, lots adults needing quarantine drop mask precautions schools. Low probabilities death, lots possibilities disruption inconvenience. home recognizes science. 

Yet use anecdotes form opinion. buy trusted industrial supply stores use eBay storefront. ideal verified actual industrial store. reason idea use one one covid mitigation strategy given time. know got embedded everyone's consciousness.

We using mitigation strategies try get pandemic control, instead quibbling arguing ones better ones possible, ones desirable. pandemic. Spanish influenza 1919, Philadelphia urged hold pro war rally pandemic. went ahead parade subsequently saw worst infection death rates world. I’m mostly carefree. worry unvaccinated(to young) daughter. rest. God wills say.  vaccines highly effective. low chance catching disease, spreading disease, severely effected disease. statistics show it. 

The statistics bear original strain, absolutely, Delta. 

[Israel says Pfizer Covid vaccine 39% effective delta spreads, still prevents severe vaccines still effective preventing severe illness, hospitalization death. But, Pfizer least, it’s 39% effective preventing cases Delta. haven’t seen data likely breakthrough patients spread Delta variant. anyone data that, please link it.  lots studies found masks worn day filthy germy generally healthy. Meanwhile evidence widespread breakouts schools mask mandates. studies shown masks (other properly fitted N95 masks perhaps KN95) helpful stopping transmission. moms science side, side panic fear.  exactly CDC's purview, one, main problem.

I mean, introduce policy like, rolled MRNA vaccines April 2020. 7-day average cases highest since May 3rd. 
 
The 7-day average hospitalizations highest since May 21st. 


Compared UK Israel much higher going wrong direction (although cases still increasing faster). right regional thing that's always US problem significant regional differences vaccination rates. mean, see way this. let burn population. 

That might popular opinion around wrong first suggested year ago, argument looks MUCH stronger today back several reasons:

* vaccines now. still highly effective Delta. still great option anyone wants personally protect themselves. totally changes social situation - protecting others can't protect completely different ask protecting others refuse protect themselves.

* healthcare system almost surely going fine. Hospitals burning ground January five times many daily cases now, highly unlikely we'll ever surpass peak. clear massive capacity handle covid cases without whole system grinding halt feared last year. 

* looks like already herd immunity, thing totally control damn near 6 months, several involving few/no restrictions almost anywhere. Delta come simply moved equation (because contagiousness virus major variable herd immunity). Perhaps 70% immune enough, Delta contagious maybe need 85%, 90%, you. Whatever number is, can't far still. burn pretty quickly. make invincible you’re vaccinated pile crowded public spaces sans mask absolutely nothing worry about.

President Biden said couple days ago many words. ""If get vaccination going get covid.""

I think least seeing signs walking idea back last weeks, ostensible goal vaccines make less sick hopefully keep dying. much line reality, messaging along IMO. think interesting topic(longer dosage could effective). live Canada everybody got different dose(some got AZ mixed Pfizer got Pfizer mixed Moderna) different time(I waited 1.5 month know someone waited 2 months). Right also enough supply vaccine following regular schedule.

So I'm afraid Canadian data inconsistent. UK similar thing. US Israeli data likely give accurate picture effective vaccines are. Could rulebreaker wearing mask back sign says everyone needed them. think fair call guy never wore mask liar Walmart changed sign.  live Florida. carefree summer here. hope people live saner places good summer. was. truly sad part city large enough anyone could done that, bar’s community small enough knew it- one people dumb enough post Facebook social justice hero move. Said people personae non grata bar, edict. 

By last health department visit, officer apologizing even there, required follow person every call-in. I’m sorry waste time. 

It really put us stupid spot. mandated business follow rules, every business owner take it. Step Snek idiot street different idea required us, maybe restrictive compared guy next door. I’m glad spot now, I’m prepared back spot depending Delta goes.  Vaccinated American. Still staying indoors wearing mask go store I'm stuck living Florida people give shit masks vaccines 100 degrees outside.

Excited fun fall though, finally gonna get back traveling stuff slows hot maintained provisions reached minimum threshold 70% vaccinated. Reinstate public health measures address Delta variant *actually can* rely herd immunity. Okay fine. They’re trespassing. actually illegal unlike lying. Well considering LA hasn’t even done don’t think it’s likely. Capacity limits directly hurt business way mask mandates people money make sacrifices they'll pay avoid unfortunately, least while. Low income communities probably effected first. Thanks reply!  Careless* summer. thing. walk ""employee only"" door, lying employee. trespassing. Breaking rules lying.  Haha inhaling dust make quarantined, thanks man!  anybody know/have record increase since last report? much related beginning pandemic, said masks needed. believe knew masks needed, scared hoarders would buy limited supply hospital workers needed. untruthful without words. rule unvax must mask lair. That's entirely fair bit least spoken trying (it's retired). believe there's book Band Played On, may confusing sources. That's relief hear thanks! thanks kind answer pandemic normal administration (circa 2020), CDC would published guidance usual White House would put together real advisory council would one people would listen to. 

Having completely haphazard (or dangerous/outright wrong) policy issued president's office set course. country looks CDC set policy, instead trusting policymakers whose job consider ramifications guidance like that. US got pharmacies. need doctor give vaccination. Id send state rep, hes RT. believe covid thinks masks abuse. praying CDC go back mask recommendations. really need fully vaccinated people go backwards. Here’s want know - chances actually catching Delta and/or showing symptoms. trust won’t die, want know actual stats positivity rate personal decisions. like study Israel put last week (IIRC maybe 64% Delta?)? don’t believe we’re truly tracking due guidelines testing vaccinated individuals outside hospital. Also, UK Canada delayed 2nd shots, overall numbers weighed heavily towards people received second dose recently Israel. 

I wish UK/Canada month month breakdowns like Israeli study. could better isolate variables see different dosing schedule making differences. Better yet, need US study Pfizer recipients Moderna J&amp;J. Literally every person walks past “unvaccinated guests must wear mask sign” unmasked unvaxxed liar, county 60% population. Thank God live ridiculous country anymore. stupid American population be?  Australia slow (and unfortunately failed, thus far) vaccine rollout due Federal government making bad decisions, focus (pandemic strategy) concentrated lockdowns reduce spread.

The protesters selfish self-defeating within context national strategy. 

Australia pandemic strategy hard lockdown low covid numbers. Aiming 0 cases opening country. OFF/ON nature, get cases, lockdown (OFF) none, open (ON). countries chosen different strategies. 

Right wrong, no-one know plays out.

Australia suffered really long lockdowns, also deal deaths issues..... guess everyones critic... hey, said, know right end.

I seen protests ruled voices 5G, agenda 21, Qanon etc etc etc conspiracy theorists, concerning. social norm something people feel social pressure others around thing. Wearing clothing social norm. Putting hand mouth cough sneeze social norm. Saying please thank social norm.

There obviously law things (well, communities laws nakedness), mostly people learn kind unconsciously time begin feel strange don't. Parenting lot teaching child social norms community.

It's social norm, well law many jurisdictions, wear seatbelt car. people without thinking now, took decade inculcate population.

After year, many countries including US made fairly good progress establishing norm wearing masks crowded indoor spaces. would taken mask anyway getting vaccinated. really wasn’t way around happening societal level. I’m simply going keep living like due anti-vaxxers ""Unvax must wear masks"" unvaccinated person goes unmasked. person liar. need words untruthful. Right. work out. still wonder bit unfair calculation average person people eligible December vs April. restrict say data 30th April 2021, see better results enough data yet timeframe compare w/ total? **Jul. 26, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Public health decisions made using large numbers percentages, necessarily zero COVID world lot people want vaccinated ineligible (I'm one them). We're morons us disabled worthy society's protection whether believe not.

This sub become unempathetic lately. see epidemiologists saying immune escape thing. Vaccines try target parts virus required infection. makes harder virus escape immunity.

Natural immunity unfortunately result antibodies parts virus required infection. makes easier variants escape immunity.

And right reducing number infections key preventing evolution new variants. roughly guessed get one variant per 100 million infections. Flipside could get number infections 1 million year, would take average 70 years develop new variant.

Notable saw comment paper proposed people lose immunity particular cold viruses much immunity wanes, new variants evolve every couple years. requirement certain jobs

It's going end mandated lot jobs. likely outcome government better chance putting pressure businesses offering incentives incentivizing general populace.

Australia New Zealand become land hermits keep up. psychologically good mental health overall economic well being. I'm shocked far behind vaccinations, Japan. Weird cultural stuff going on. Ok. Let’s stop giving access healthcare, then. aren’t going bare minimum toward public (and individual) health, spending tax/insurance dollars treating them? didn’t care vaccine, care now? Let Darwinism rear it’s ugly head stop catering ignorant population. Texas still Ren Festival year. likely people getting COVID less intelligent - believing vaccinations masks. think many us forget people legitimate health issues cannot get vaccine. 

I know people whose doctor told bucket 'CAN GET VACCINATED' took risk anyway anti-vaxxers continuing asshats. 

To incentivize vaccine way would discriminatory towards legitimate documented health problems not, not, get vaccine unless looking super fun hospital stay. much lucky. simply banned exports. UK ahead well vaccine produced EU exported non EU countries 50%. main reason anyone else significant amount vaccines. dogpile running play… I’d believe people actually disclose methods data.  Yikes! Wonder it’s first world vs third world thing somehow? Seems like many counties similar UK joke purposefully using bad grammar corrected using incorrect spelling and-- oh, never mind.  First, security theater, technically?

Second, CDC considering issuing mask guidelines vaccinated people. Guidelines mandates. 

Third, would states issue new mask mandates based criteria consider infection rates, hospitalization, etc. county level state. Meaning, would applied counties surges cases, hospitalizations, etc. Exactly implementing policy based data security theater?

Fourth, don’t belief masks effective, you’ve lost me, sorry. That’s… viruses work

Generic predisposition matters many fronts mean going believe? affect children Indonesia last year? serious illness extremely unlikely, infections means variants side step vaccines become lethal vaccinated people.

There's huge caveat gets ignored 99% discussions. Let's say fight tooth nail slowly manage scrape idiots reach 90% population vaccinated (won't ever happen let's say). 

Are protected variants emerging? Hell no. gained almost zero protection that. point covid cases US tiny fraction global cases (far tinier ""official"" numbers would suggest, since large majority countries planet barely test all). really make much difference whether 300 million people herd immune versus almost-herd-immune. mean, look what's happening now. Delta come anti-vaxx morons perpetuating virus country 20k cases day whatever? No, came bajillion daily cases getting pumped opposite side world. 

That's always case, continue case long time, maybe even forever, since world barley even begun vaccinate still. don’t understand getting downvoted.

Blame US blocking sale raw materials, truth raw materials US even meant manufacturing AZ vaccines. US sky rocketing covid numbers. shit like enrages me. IP never issue.  


That said, US already committed donating 200 million vaccines year, another 300 million next year, battling pandemic &amp; disinformation home. Getting vaccination covid possible.

Absolute morons. it’s likely smarter people avoid contracting virus.

Fewer deaths necessarily mean virus less deadly, since people vaccinated.   Call prayer tents. single events (Superbowl, 4 July, Euros, etc) called ""superspreader"" whatever actually impact pandemic course?  neither. Let cost college events social experiences. schools requiring vaccine. fully vaccinated campus deserves normalcy. one (many) messages spat echo chambers ""Well, what? Getting vaccinated get anything, I'm still subject restrictions"". thought they'd switch carrot-and-stick approach: unvaxxed means masks distancing, vaxxed means freedom restrictions.

The crucial error assuming certain groups would honor unvaxxed restrictions fact honor. already little, think psyche different think people keeping awhile. moved back (lived before) September spent vast majority 10 months kind restrictions past Monday, oddly enough. Five months proper lockdown. think really rocked country quite bit. definitely crowd burned masks Monday, people remember last 15 months like (especially London hearing sirens every 10-15 minutes noise back January).

I'm saying remote schooling worse people dying, children losing perhaps year worth schooling pretty bad impact. That's precisely people get vaccines - themselves, need get vaxxed kids go school person without killing grandparents. say vaccine passports mean like mandating vaccination go restaurant love went flatten curve absolutely 0 covid

More black white thinking. Incase noticed, hospitals filling areas around country, mind since vaxxed pandemic actions part required quell happening. makes sense working specialized profession, mask use could make job impossible. hoping get day-to-day life example, thank reply. best hearing empathize side things. mean, way wanting live life way want without taking might affect others account (""what business"") straight definition selfish?

How someone wants everyone else put lives hold order comfort irrational anxiety? think that's pretty selfish. vaccinated person wants go life mask putting anyone else serious increased risk.  fact honestly believed covid thing past point year shows health government leaders failed public. seemed clear spread wasn’t going away vaccines alone, especially limited uptake new variants.

The lifting mask mandate think gravest error visible “this pandemic over” rule one lift. solely take face value. 

At point refusing get vaccinated likely emblematic deeper held opposing ideologies.  Close 60% state. 38% full vaccination, like 45% single dose. you’ve got freedom choose healthcare you’ve got freedom hospital turn away.

Shit, put obese people back line medical care since need eat much, people smoke, people drink alcohol healthy amount, people exercise, people drive recklessly, there's really limit started going path. would think tested negative participate British Open tested positive again. That's interesting testing history.  sure CDC understands that. watching data. UK much ""look future"". We're 3 weeks behind them. likely play similarly here. obvious sarky try make point, but:

Infection/hospitalisation data always shoes consistent lag couple weeks policy changes (e.g. lockdown rule changes). furthermore, know empirical certainty positive effects masks social distancing.

But yeah... Vaccines work chaps DC probably among first places backpedal lifting mask mandate, especially considering early stated going keep requiring masks school settings next school year.

But hey, optimistic side coin, maybe that's actually improvement last year. DC in-person schooling then? know Fall River didn't.   people refuse vaccine problem. Don’t really care vaccination rate stat. Also people don’t wear masks anyway.

The people refuse vaccinate absolutely problem. long virus still active among large portions population strong risk mutate become resistant current vaccines. you’ve failed mention metric it’s safe enough restrictions return normal. question many us asked you. Instead you’ve done choose play victim Internet forum absurd genuine question/conversation attack.

Obviously 50% fully vaccinated enough quell virus point. take rocket scientist hard data see need people vaccinated get things control. reach threshold keeps community spread level acceptable maybe time put extra measures would help quell spread virus. Remember, still lot people can't get vaccinated yet process getting vaccinated. 

I'm playing victim here. live reality realizes fluid situations like require adaptation. Massk  curse humor Internet. :( One worst fails sarcasm detected got like -200 votes. D'oh!

It’s zero sum game. create therapy well I’m sorry, you’re completely wrong issue IP, although don’t really blame there’s lot misinformation around realities manufacturing. Even though individual vaccines waived restrictions, technologies underlie still IP restricted it’s essentially still impossible make them. It’s like Russian doll patents dealt full TRIPS waiver, EU blocking US isn’t actually supportive beyond vague statements Biden administration. Here’s good breakdown Moderna, also ostensibly enforcing among dumb uneducated.

Changing guidance/your mind isn’t weakness. I've read too. think covid deadly enough that's killing hosts spread. mean theory? Info Meduza three weeks, Moscow restaurants serve visitors without QR codes. could obtained vaccinated people, also ill, well fresh negative PCR test. time, statistical indicators federal registers encrypted QR codes certificates began come Russians. Studying certificates issued State Services, Meduza, Kholod Mediazona found already 29 million entries register Ministry Health, created track number cases coronavirus. five times officially reported operational headquarters fight coronavirus.

&amp;#x200B;

Mayor Moscow Sergei Sobyanin announced June 22 week, restaurants cafes allow visitors QR codes. Muscovites vaccinated, covid last six months, passed negative PCR test could get mos.ru Moscow portal state services .

&amp;#x200B;

The measure planned short-term one, leave chances non-Muscovites get restaurants, similar system assigning QR codes later implemented federal portal ""Gosuslug""; Moscow site began issuing codes June 28, ""Gosuslugi"" - July 1.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Deputy Minister Digital Development Russia Oleg Kachanov explained delay June 24 need integrate ""State Services"" bases Ministry Health. “There unified register ill information resources Ministry Health Russian Federation ... integration, it, nine million records register, receive \[QR codes\],” said official interview ""Russia 24"".

&amp;#x200B;

The number patients named Kachanov - nine million - became sensation, because, judging data headquarters day - June 24, - five million Russians ill coronavirus. However, journalists three editions found out, official overestimate, even underestimated number.

&amp;#x200B;

The researcher statistical anomalies, physicist Sergei Shpilkin, studies vaccination rates, drew attention words Kachanov discrepancy official statistics. soon put forward hypothesis real number ill estimated based numbers State Services certificates QR code - since somehow connected federal register covid.

&amp;#x200B;

Physicist Sergei Shpilkin usually investigates statistical anomalies voting, onset epidemic, began closely monitor statistics morbidity mortality covid, well progress vaccinations. noticed ""State Services"" vaccination certificates numbered order, asked wish send part number certificate. analysis collected numbers led conclusion numbering vaccination certificates whole Russia, means number certificate (the last eight digits) find many people vaccinated country moment. numbers obtained Shpilkin completely coincided data vaccinations, collected independent analysts (the Ministry Health never began publish data).

&amp;#x200B;

At time, Shpilkin ""had another idea . "" suggested since vaccination certificates numbered order, certificates ill arranged similar way. asked everyone help: send impersonal part certificate number date recovery coronavirus indicated it.

&amp;#x200B;

Unique numberA Mediazona reader Moscow contracted coronavirus end March, got sick easily within two weeks already received negative PCR test. Three months later, Gosuslugi app sent notification ""COVID-19 immunization certificate"" QR code visiting Moscow restaurants.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, code simple hyperlink leads special section site ""Gosuslug"". opening link, restaurant employee must make sure visitor restaurant premises. open link computer look page code, see certificate number indicated abbreviation UNRZ (unrz). ""Unique register record number"", term used many registers Ministry Health - designation also page vaccination certificate code.

&amp;#x200B;

The day speech Deputy Minister Kachanov integration register cases, June 25, description data download scheme ""from COVID register"" appeared situation center Ministry Digital Science technical portal . addition data, 15-digit UNRZ number must also transferred register.

&amp;#x200B;

Is possible see number certificate patient recovered? journalists Meduza, Holod Mediazona found yes.The number certificate past illness consists 16 digits: eight, two-digit region code unit (this number certificates checked and, judging similar registers , denotes recipient budgetary funds); next four digits month year; last eight digits unique number patient.

&amp;#x200B;

The format (only without eight beginning, is, 15-digit) used formation NRM Federal Register Persons New Coronavirus Infection. data sick person first saved register, assigned NRZ - moment shown training video Ministry Health. Apparently, time, date, encoded UNRZ, also assigned, gets certificate number. all, reader Mediazona, recovered April, 0321 certificate number place date - diagnosed March. go fair worried what's vaccine🤷‍♂️ people DEEPLY invested believing human body bomb calorimeter Seems like change law legitimate health issue. rational take I’ve seen thread. It’s embarrassing see others trying say you’re bad person living life like normal person I'm sorry, can't. supposed information? way small pox polio. 

People charge soft internet militarized emboldened science denying morons much. husband required wear mask face face conversations clients, there's expectation clients wear masks. live low vaccine rate area currently high hospitalization rate. decided even vaccinated best use N95 masks days meet clients. easier get now.  Initial reports encouraging front   30-year-old Australia? doubtful. teacher well, I’m guessing pro online school people generally teachers without school age children. absolute disaster teachers students. teacher state require masks mandate 6' distance students.

edit:
I googled heresay legal documents spell gives legal def. Don’t know you’re getting downvoted this, it’s absolutely correct. point comes personal responsibility. people choose get vaccinated, okay! ones assuming risk. Precisely. That’s comes to. head least…political calculus. covid staying home kids get vaccinated one thing. 
You referenced someone kept home ages 5-18, held positive example. need understand poor kid probably see childhood positively. I'm held example unschooling community earned B.S degree age 21. Like means parents succeeded. parents isolated me, prevented shared experiences (the lack continues hobbies adulthood), gave lonely childhood peers. stuck inside parents house without break almost 24/7, staring 4 walls, dying boredom plotting ways escape hoarding house. parents, like many homeschooling parents, narcissistic, care well knew it. kept home partly hide this, allowed talk adults knew. teacher would red flagged neglect I'd school, I'm sure it. 

Many, many homeschoolers similar stories. facade. legit ship fast. company supplies respirators oil industry workers Texas. They're overpriced either. Lol, political climate? 

Vaccine mandates would throw next election parties screaming bloody murder top lungs. 

I promise news running “vaccine mandates gun control, what’s next?” Headlines within hours.

I think forget split country is, vaccines reason become point resistance it.  protocols, fully vaccinated individuals exposed COVID-positive individual subject mandatory five-day isolation kept bunch players, coaches others games 2020, per Pelissero.

Sounds like recipe outbreak. think intentionally downplaying therapeutics push vaccines. wants shot get antiviral medication second show symptoms Oh you’re right, guess regressing virus it’s fun digital punching bag represents everyone kinda screwed us over. Entertaining even asking following CDC guidelines wearing mask vaccination human decency? Jesus christ people dumb   mother keeps asking bringing (obviously) unvaccinated 3 year old visit. 

And keep asking, “Did get vaccine yet?” 

I feel pain, stay course stay safe! many doctors support blanket mask mandate applies vaccinated people. mostly politicians advocating them.  people long covid symptoms ease receiving vaccine. understand feel. felt same. However, way see it, least trials vaccinated studied long term documented clinically. know truthfully many people. total contracted Covid, long term effects, way clinically document assess long term effects Covid vs well documented follow vaccinations going forwards   Yeah you’d think natural immunity would strong, understand it’s pretty good protection viruses. Ok I'm confused reddit pro online school? Honestly teacher, nightmare. children's development clearly halted needed work overtime get meet goals. understand scared anecdotally, none students personally caught cases whole school. I'd argue RSV probably common covid. Never said anything downplaying virus dumbass, said politicized it. Learn read. Good point!

It’s good see Italy well vaccinations, essentially served sacrificial lamb western world serious virus going become. think lot people “oh shit” moment things really started spiral control Lombardy.  risk unvaccinated people society? I’m intrigued actually know mind works. Antivaxxers seriously running time fight downplay efficacy vaccines. hope people know article big lie.   source biased incorrect. story originally posted Gateway Pundit. look article makes claims yours, near end, reference actual news station (ABC news Australia), inferring news channel's article would back up. clicking article, says this: ""There currently 141 COVID-19 cases admitted hospital, 43 people intensive care, 18 require ventilation. 43 people intensive care, 42 vaccinated.""  truth. 43 ICU, 1 vaccinated. 42 not. proves vaccines work. Vaccines never stop infections hospitalizations could happen, promoted reduce risk severe illness (ICU/ventilator) death.  done that.  extremely rare much even known them. That's ridiculous statement.... really think entire world like US, vaccines tap anyone get sorted whenever feel like it? Even rich Europe sated vaccine demand yet... still banned traveling US despite US tourists allowed in. Go conservatives. Start boycotting thw NFL. infringing freedoms (somehow) Whuhhh? f would fine them? would complete accident, something intentional. make 0 sense. Thank empathy rooting person's health. went engineering school huge chunk curriculum nothing neutral, free influence society influence society. responsible solutions would affect society, consider environment working order successful project. 

These people, nominally charge health policy, genuinely consider Americans would affected react policies. absolutely pathetic, embarrassing, tragedy. innocent mistake lesson learned - already learned lessons again. failure. No, sounds amazing. collateral damage, amazing. Actually countries Africa huge vaccine hesitancy problem No... ? would they? article clearly says ""unvaccinated"". Considering I'm extremely low risk severe covid, currently see need vaccine could also put hospital. I'd rather roll dice voluntarily, even chances less. 

I get one eventually testing done, I'm interested what's currently available. idea make “prototype” vaccines protect viruses 20 families might spark new pandemic. Using research tools proved successful Covid-19, researchers would uncover molecular structure virus, learn antibodies must strike it, prod body making exactly antibodies. Every disaster really opportunity clout. Seriously. guess guys never heard social psychology. What, immature stupid behavior displayed outbreak, made believe unvaccinated people would responsible thing keep wearing mask? tend less harsh someone took reasonable precautions still shitty luck happen them.

Let’s make majority people likely low income, need pay hundreds dollars week tested go work.

Vaccine mandates all.

You want vaccinated punished able go gym, movies, restaurants bars?

Nope. Require proof vaccination places negative test, free.

I wasn’t ever proponent vaccine mandates now. Sorry, it’s fair thing do. Vaccinated, responsible, educated people longer need give flying fuck unvaccinated.

Make lives hard. Now. Good know. Thank you! I’m bringing 20 n95s me. I’ll def regular cloth masks everyday stuff, traveling airport / mass transit, I’ll wearing n95.  wish US shit together like la bella italia! 

I miei bravi tutti amici! 

Very happy cool Italians! don’t know - poster thinks pay hospitalization follow advice reality tv stars instead scientists? define personal responsibility responsible personally decisions? Yes virus much contagious, much infectious. causes long term symptoms much frequently common viruses. 


Jesus people anyone paying attention past 18 months? Pretty similar talks others anti-vaxxers always use drunk driving analogy.

Sure made decision reckless one influence people around puts others much higher risk. People selfishly think impacting decision ie ""If get sick get sick"" = ""I'll risk DUI"" puts everybody else greater risk. Everyone knows blame resides. everyone got vaccinated issue anymore. unfortunately people think hoax take seriously individually affects them. forcing get vaccinated would cause LOT violence. 

Let burn unvaccinated. made choice. 

The chart says Acceleration.. think report incorrect ""rate acceleration"".. acceleration. Acceleration **cases/week** per week   country and/or world needs put money mouth is. either want things reopened risk pandemic coming back full force worse squash costs.

You can't both.

You can't claim want virus gone people safe and/or unwilling take necessary actions so.

The facts this, world reopened early without truly knowing control US' case, whenever next variant potentially either vaccine resistant lethal comes around, huge trouble precedent set we'll never truly lockdown anything whole heartily event fatal outbreak ""freedom"" ""the economy""

This whole piece designed ""live world fear"" world common sense realism. COVID calling worlds' collective bluff deal it. 

If ""digital passport"", etc implemented, permanent, likely short term. gave average pandemic current one almost same, 36%. highest 58% hight second wave, currently fast approaching third wave. vaccine works Yup. thing. soon heard December like "" well shit could hit fan quickly"". rich people started cancelling things needed know stock things start staying away people. I’m saying it’s dumb mentality stating reality situation… They’re thinking it, comes priorities money. 

If can’t think (some casual internet) definitely are. Yep. Stay fuck classroom vaccinated much lower Netherlands, following similar peak decline.  rest public needs know blame resides.

Frustrated new mask mandates? Angry renewed restrictions? Thank antivaxxers -- they're reason pandemic still thing. understand. think used convey urgency. Unfortunately recommendations fall deaf ears. cases seems faith thing? Friend mine (distant) relatives religious believe they’re righteous they’ll divinely protected covid (“covered blood Jesus” way put it). perversely, getting vaccinated suggests you’re weaker faith. It’s frustrating bit scary.

(And course jokes parables long-standing phenomenon, like one religious man caught hurricane rejected multiple rescue attempts, saying “god save me”…and complains heaven God let drown, tell “God sent weather forecast, two boats rescue helicopter, God tried best stubborn!” God sent us vaccines, too, but…)  gonna lie: I'm forced mask again, even I'm fully vaccinated, pissed. Royally pissed. really, really hate wearing masks places pre-pandemic. told government months vaccinated people like go back normal activities. backtrack variant vaccine protects feel soul crushing demoralizing. 

Just needed vent. Boy oh boy hate wearing masks! lockdown?  lot schools finished England 2nd half last week early impact yet. metrics need changed. Vaccines prevent surges deaths hospitalizations, people getting mild symptoms, like non lethal illness. agree everything said. burn unvaccinated quickly! say vaccines don’t work? Reddit LOVES assumptions generalizations. Multiple European vaccination agencies actually declined recommend vaccionations 16 y.o. 

The risk children tiny! would offer ""soft protection"" real vaccines specific virus roll out? friend fully vaxxed (moderna, months after) caught Delta lost taste/smell almost 2 weeks. Losing essentially brain damage. 

While immediate risk death severe symptoms highly unlikely, longterm neurological disorders like Parkinsons could still manifest vaccinated/infected. Also article front page Israel indicating still 20% chance transmitting Delta catch vaccinated still high feel 'safe' harming others.

Mask up, distance plague rats stand ground. like groundhogs day hell 2.0 I'm worried even worse lax vaccinated become thinking them. next mutation could make precautions inadequate. Dang that’s awesome. crazy thing size population certainly false negatives too. PCRs 9 30% false negative rate Covid depending study read. virus cause long term damage - flu, mono, measles etc. specific Covid. meanwhile best friend partner, unvaccinated, las vegas birthday week. tried talk getting shot nothing sticking. extremely worried her. read millions people dying every week world? would nice.  Wait…..are replying right post? didn’t say big deal. it’s normal. also warm UK past couple weeks. AC means lot open windows everywhere. Also, schools closed holidays, vaccines, natural immunity. likely combination. gotten vaccine, chosen get immunity naturally. going hide forever. either get shot, rolling dice infection. Nothing else done it. That's implying. encourage vaccinations, implement social distancing measures necessary.

Sometimes sub unbearable hysterics  Vaccines 1 many tools toolbox. use tools disposal?

Why would want wear mask? tool works insanely well already. need boost 80% efficacy 25% people suffer ‘long covid’ diminishes quality life.

The vaguely defined ""long covid"". personal mask-wearing diminishes quality life. Infections spiked masks longer compulsory schools Daily (podcast New York Times) interesting episode today breakthrough infections. 

You listen here:  think wording important here. Saying young people safer implies old people safe, young people even so. old people safe. Old people risk. fact, young people. Young people risk, old people even risk. Delta infectious severe, people risk ever. much risk difficult, multi-variable problem. Behavior, vaccines, variants, seasonality, co-morbidities, etc. Amidst complexity least one simple thing: getting vaccinated decreases risk.

Devil's details, sure. objectively false describe anybody ""safe"" since age group zero risk. Nobody completely safe. course, that's anybody trying say. ""completely safe"" goal. We're completely safe lot things nevertheless warrant much concern. hear ""young people safer"" must sound like nothing worry about, safe, even safe people also safe. Sure sounds like absolutely nothing worry about. Here's picked random Google current COVID-19 vaccines likely last least year, probably won’t offer lifelong protection, measles shots, said Dr. Kathleen Neuzil, vaccine expert University Maryland School Medicine.

As say, well known. Even AP seems know it. tell work.

Viruses mutate allowed spread, allowed spread uncontrolled, strain Covid mutate able affect children? &lt;3  
At point research ancedotes...it sounds like getting always worse option getting needing help afterwards rare event something happens.  


I want give benefit doubt I'm already dealing many Q's immediate life. Meanwhile, got Pfizer 16 weeks pregnant.  they’ve implemented mandate week removing it. would things fine?

Well took couple weeks LA. they're they're bunch It’s people many breakthrough cases.

No, they're not. do? Living constant fear rest lives? never go away now. Odds aren’t calculated combining them. It’s complicated that, didn’t take statistics, luckily there’s handy dandy calculator that: 9.75%. mask mandate gives cities states (even Feds) legal future lawsuits people sue ""you protected me"". Even republican

What anything? Spain target 70% end August. yesterday, 65% total population one dose 54.7% both*.

*If covid last 6 months get one dose people considered fully protected.

Source: Mask compliance honor system unvaccinated simply untenable. making restrictions waivable private spaces enforcing proof vax, mask requirements things like subways minor imposition. Don’t think many people respect  current rate vaccination may hit 75% entire population fully vaccinated end September.

But usually point vaccination rate drops hit stubborn anti-vaccine population. ... nobody would allowed visit places vaccines. changes nothing done day one vaccine release. tip toeing around due nursing unions needs stop! vaccinated fully healthy like wearing seatbelt even though car crash recently plan one future.

Inb4 ""vaccines studied cause harm good healthy people"", yep use say similar things seatbelts: ""you'll trapped car wreck, would rather able crawl out"".

Vaccines seatbelts save lives. get ticket drive without seatbelt, child car restrained properly. can't wait restrict unvaccinated something protect children. want wear seatbelt, cool, drive. want vaccine, great, stay society.

Like seemingly overlap christians refuse mask kids 12 obviously vaccinated?!? Honestly, time take view situation amateur think ""wow, experts sure stupid even see obviously wrong framework"" there's pretty much 100% chance missing important nuance actually much picture think. honestly pretty frustrating comments get upvoted reliably here. inappropriate democratization expertise big part reason situation moment. here, example, people completely dismiss early mask guidance issued standard assumption mishandling contaminated mask could potentially risk factor spreading virus. 
 
But point, certainly many, many people study sociology policy side public health, CDC shortage expertise. personally think least part issue elements CDC hamstrung early previous administration, saw political entity control. saying maybe closer herd immunity thought.

Could be, vaccine hesitancy, drag people got vaccinated infected.

If unvaccinated dies, new mutations comes along drag another 10 years, bad.  never tested positive COVID, January, body went absolutely haywire. Rashes body (shingles-esque), petechiae, dizziness, fever. period boned ever since- starting get back track, they’re super heavy (compared super light Jan-June timeframe). Yup!! mean, haven’t minded working throughout even though firing line lied to? takes mickey! Dr. Spaceman Doesn’t mean understand enough know wouldn’t paying taxes. folks vote lower taxes rich   pulled Japan. many think worldwide. I'd say Blair Brown smart, also deeply flawed. CDC make rules. government does. CDC simply said safe enough vaccinated wear masks. make decision stop mandates never even existed national levl. reply removed p l. 

Basically America well positioned handle we’ll damned anything help around here. Thank idea, explanation take account pattern occurring across multiple countries (and therefore cultures). young child too, I've found difficult find news this. would recommend look? Oh sure, week, change back two weeks now, change again, hear something completely different media, go back something else... fraction fraction percentage something bad happening.

That sounds logical right? That's odd, groupthink Reddit full throated support dropping mask mandates vaccinated.  makes sense, thank you. Straight tested negative, three times. People seem deleting app everyone getting pinged recording People virus before...so maybe rosy led believe.  Lol told they’d need one go cafes like hold wine, gotta go get vaccine. place visit vaccinated nearest place get said vaccine. think champion Bulgaria. cool experience pandemic normies witness innovation medicine like this!

* Leaders expect 80% population vaccinated then

Singapore aims relax virus curbs, including starting allow quarantine-free travel September, marking first time it’s set timeline reopen borders mostly shut year.

The Southeast Asian city-state expects fully vaccinated 80% population then, placing nation solid position move forward reopening, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong told Parliament Monday.

That allow authorities ease measures, including allowing larger gatherings fully vaccinated people. country also able start reopening borders establishing travel corridors countries regions infections control.

“While countries may come terms certain level Covid -19 cases even deaths, choice want make Singapore,” Wong said. “At time, need wait everyone vaccinated begin open up. would mean holding back entire reopening timeline much later year, tenable.”

One world’s success stories containing virus, Singapore suffered setback mid-July infections spread karaoke lounges fishery port supplies produce markets island. 1,000 people infected clusters, city set daily record local virus cases.

**Temporary Setback**

Singapore aiming two-thirds population vaccinated Aug. 9 independence day, planned ease measures. outbreaks growing concern 200,000 elderly yet vaccinated prompted authorities tighten curbs, raising questions whether city-state deviating reopening path.

“The answer clear no. determined get destination Covid-resilient Singapore. journey must take account public health realities,” Trade Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said separate speech Parliament. “Sometimes, may need take detour see hazards ahead. way ensure get final destination safely, even though may take little longer.”

Authorities review existing virus curbs early August based factors overall infection rate. positive outcome allow government ease measures -- vaccinated people, Wong said.

Once key inoculation levels reached, Wong said, fully vaccinated people may able travel without serving 14-day hotel quarantine return. Depending risk level countries visited, quarantine replaced rigorous testing regime, quarantine shortened seven days served home. Unvaccinated individuals also travel, quarantine.

**Shifting Approaches**

Health Minister Ong Ye Kung told Parliament Singapore already shifting parts approach live virus, 200 cases day may unusual endemic scenario.

More infected patients show mild symptoms housed community-care facilities rather hospitals, said. already case patients aged 17-45, authorities expand bracket age 59, said.

That means many 60% infected cases may recover community-care facilities. government aims raise number 80%, patients even recovering home, said.

Although Singapore proceeding progressive easing, Wong cautioned may dial back measures situation worsens.

“At stage easing monitor health outcomes, especially hospitalization intensive care unit cases closely,” Wong said. “We ensure remain acceptable stable, proceed next step. hospitalization cases -- worse, severe illnesses -- shoot up, prepared slow down, even pull back.” Thank you! wonder countries open to. Risk children incredibly mention evidence vaccinated people less likely spread virus. ""Think children"" rhetoric used decades way guilt trip populace, time plenty evidence show ridiculous is. theory contagious Delta is, burned low hanging fruit rapidly. makes sense. mRNA vaccines completely different ones received before.  So, myriad reasons avoiding mask mandate big among dominate? Plenty people say want see side effects, think really care that, mask mandate? get talk new mandates then? seeing unvaccinated die vaccinated get bad cold win people too, restrictions no. death rate children probably low 0.002% (1 fifty thousand). least countries good public healthcare system.

But surely higher poor countries places less access healthcare. see one lot, makes lot ""Just Desserts"" sense realize innocent, good people unable get vaccine, like young immunocompromised. Taking scorched earth policy route also condemns groups, which, aside general calous nature ""you get deserve"", big stop sign choosing option say I'm sorry.

Really expected better Biden administration extremely disappointed  cases plateau first dropping there?  vaccinating people wearing masks won’t anything except make people feel better like ""just wait until"" BECOMES deadly. Unvaccinated people means fertile breeding (and mutating) pools virus. knows, Epsilon might 30% fatality rate Honestly, real solution forcing people get vaccinated. Rolling restrictions based new strains great solution, since safer vaccinated people grave danger unvaccinated people ignore them. restrictions ease people get together cases go new strains emerge goes cycle. want stop living dystopia stop using bandaid (ie. masks) start using scalpel. Thing is, listen government. private sector needs require vaccines go stores work. countries work harder far less wealth nowhere near obese province heavily regulated, school board events coordinator. kids endless opportunities gather homeschoolers science, sports, field trips, music classes, etc. I've homeschooled ten years now. kids grown ""classmates.""

Exactly. Also reason they're bent maintaining and/or expanding education gap country. reason nobody make mandatory anywhere world, even autocratic countries really want so, can’t fulfil criteria fully approved, covered EUA, limited legal protection. pleading thing governments approval possible. well-intentioned, that’s pretty much naive original guidance criticized lol Wrong comment, dude. Considering Hungary’s government I’m surprised they’re strict COVID   vaccines work safe, really see point mask mandates again. Data shows overwhelming majority fully vaccinated people infected Delta Variant (if infected all) seriously ill. Furthermore, people get vaccinated think hoax anyway, restrictions rule followers rule breakers field day.  lol, Biden Harris anti-vaxxer's. dumb think people are?  Vaccine passports barely inconvenience vaccinated

Well, no. time add check like this, add processing time entry venue throttle otherwise open door. places high traffic, like grocery store, essentially ID everyone entering store could generate lines slow things down. make fine proportional min salary NFL player $660k comes fine \~$1500 average salary US 2021 $68,703.

Media blown side effects proportion. bad vaccine, mostly blame media vaccine hesitancy AZ. NSW advice changed adults get AZ vaccine current outbreak.   vaxxed people able enforce it, built honor system. antivaxxers honor. 

It's *just* naive guidance CDC, way cards issued begin with. There's often state databases information vaccinations, something public use anything federal. barcode QR code data card (so faked, people doing), there's digital passport (so take picture card, actually proof). 

Not matters since states actively barring inquiry vaccination status everyone extremely skittish anyway. employers colleges begun require attend register status order allow exemptions mask wearing, average person know colleague peer following rules not. 

It's mess. antivaxxers dicks, system deliberately designed enable encourage that. excellent points.  know, see coming family friends vaccinated can't good conscience go along it. would much rather people get vaccination choice done it.

Pretty much Europe open US travelers  without vaccine passport? ever supported idea actually fucking checked cards door. suspect people advocating felt way. wrote ago comment sort reminded bears repeating. 

God…. Mother Fucking people. Look it’s real simple - simple binary decision. Here’s goes. encounter covid one day course life time. Period. virus far transmissible endemic encounter one day (may tomorrow, May 4 years now.) So, A) get vaccine face covid head on, pre-orchestrated immune response B) take vaccine give self significantly greater chance asymptomatic lightly symptomatic (in 90% range current variants). 

So it. loved ones deal consequences simple decision making process. wish people educated see simple weighing pros cons. leave final thought, lack evidence something evidence something. vaccine trials didn’t explicitly test fertility issues, microchips, heart issues etc. doesn’t mean evidence things. simply means shouldn’t assume things true without evidence. either case, point side effects incredibly rare. excuse get vaccine 99% people juncture besides ignorance wonder considered “asymptomatic “ people feel tested, even vaccinated individuals, must symptoms. mentioned above, Tennessee tracking breakthrough cases. Ohio seem be.  amazing choosing collect data something results lack evidence thing. point highly educated people sceptical vaccine, not?

If wanted point weirdness low rate, sorry mistaking point. like anti-vaxxer - unwilling thick headed point zero empathy others may going can’t get shot immediately.

People wonder there’s much division, it’s people like unwilling emphasize even spend 5 seconds thinking bit harder something like terrible precedent. Exactly right. Backpedaling undermines confidence vaccines. 

Boy, CDC *garbage* predicting human behavior, haven’t they? NY going vaccination rate got least 70% adults getting least one shot. goal reached mid-June policy went away. saw post US husband / Canadian wife work seasonal jobs countries (ski resort winter / surf shop summer something).


The husband fly Canada car sent via tow truck order make work. made zero sense ... Crowded airplane + extra person entirely driving vs driving himself. 🤷‍♀️ Haha would think realize 1% actually pretty damn high chance vaccine literally costs nothing. carrots ""socialist"" Smh. Send back stimulus checks that's case! pingdemic enforcing quasi-lockdown come contact infected person.

'Only' 600,000 people asked self-isolate. Even assume 100% complied, country 65m people doubt it'll make much difference. forgot /s mostly good, except many people infected. **universally** accepted 35 million known cases huge undercount many people actually infected. Back April, [the CDC 115 million infections occurred US - 35% population. 49% population fully vaccinated assuming random overlap groups, 67% population immunity.

Or, optimistic calculation: even 1 shot seems pretty well protective hospitalization death. almost hospitalization death adults. 69% adults least 1 shot, 80% population least enough immunity protect severe disease.

And old estimate many people infected. likely higher. We're nearer end fear. big, quick wave delta infections could push us LOT closer end - wave much lower fatality rate due vaccinations older people. feel erode public trust vaccine country whose main problem vaccination? people much, damage anti vaxxers point. remember people likely post commentary issues vaccine (personal within degrees separation) compared millions got jabs minor side effects. 

My first dose knocked ass second barely impact. (Pfizer, potentially covid March 2020). 

If you’re vaccinated you’re good go time being. I’m sure changes plenty news beyond covid subs you’ll catch anything important!

Good luck stay healthy understand many people vaccinated positive?

What say make sense.

Vaccine golden bullet. stop it. see soon. brainwashed.

There experts talk internet. probably listen.

Protect people, yes dont see reason healthy young people kids needs this.

Regarding mutation, read it. Mutation usually decreases strength virus. way. virus want kill host. wants spread. Likely explained kids developing countries likely sicker general compared kid developed countries?

Like explains countries infant mortality rates still. Except actually putting burden them, threatening order push towards free option. Suggest see doctor it. Abnormal bleeding ages “plausibly Reddit user’s mom” could perimenopause cancer. Best check. It’s probably stress, weird things, least actual professional tell she’s ridiculous. Sure, right. Except they’re tracking severe cases.

Get together, CDC, goddamn. guy saying muzzled. Step aside please. thx. that? Show magnetic? good (hint: vaccinated lunatic. Shh, tell them...actually fuck place. step within 100 yards there.)   think actually work 95% efficacy targeted strain(s)  one even go proving something like this?  
Cough one another’s face? peaks valleys

Was actually way, due reporting anomalies? test cost parking ticket, sure whatever. tests run anywhere 200 400plus.

That unfair ask anyone trying make ends meet.

Yes options, don’t know schedule, etc.

It’s unfair unreasonable.

I’m vaccination want see everyone get it, putting even burden low income families way it. worldometer 7 day average already shows downward trend. Maybe misunderstood need enroll twice amount participants already throw timeline EUA / approval? data September sure FDA saying accept without twice participants. going need follow new group long? certainly sounded like committee meeting. heard wanted follow kids longer period time determine safety effectiveness. Since Pfizer study designed demonstrate effectiveness comparing antibody levels previously studied age group (12-15 think) would really safety FDA looking longer data collection period. way add bunch kids keep timeline.
Please tell I'm wrong. want vaccine soon possible (of course assuming safety efficacy goals met). don’t think understand point. comparing people 2 countries people countries. lower class Germany Switzerland. hear Tennessee tracking breakthrough cases last Friday 10% breakthrough cases hospitalized 20% 10% resulted death. 1000+ breakthrough (in total) cases reported Friday. logical?

I used frequent early covid subs started become consprciacy theories also quite anxiety inducing stopped.

Used visit covid positive sin well help first gave mad anxiety 

and covid vaccinated sub starting fill anti vaxxers somehow stuff posted side effects help obviously first shot quite bad reaction 2nd fine headache sore arm 

so stopped visiting well mainly come information keep trying learning anything comes still much information social media insane. 

The fact still learning bout unpredictable virus alittle scary I've people come ask got vaccinated covid.

Alot people bring SARS 1 immunity years later let's also forget amount people time mutate like covid really know though still says,reinfection rare know rare really us yet enough time has,passed.

Someone really said 100 cases reinfected worldwide obviously know true answer course.   would good acknowledge fairly widespread reports menstrual cycle irregularities vaccination, including postmenopausal bleeding. See, among seem linked miscarriages. tax there's free option available  believe likely US undercounting too. excess death stats (how many people dying month, relative historical trends) suggest true COVID death toll America million already.

I'm sure denial referring to? expand that? Go back re-read comment you’re replying to. Death concern, “they die rates significantly lower than…” exactly comforting. I’d get kids vaccinated yesterday meant they’d less risk suffering long-term consequences contracting covid. could maybe even breathe little sigh relief worry hard protection virus. again, analogy admits vaccine like *sunscreen* protects *sun* *does actually damage exposed it.*

So *yes,* vaccine pointless aren’t exposed virus… except don’t selectively apply remove vaccine, want able go “in sun” safe need “sunscreen.”

Again, analogy spot on, don’t seem understand it’s making opposite point wish was. actually does, I'm pretty sure.

""Savannah’s mandate requires everyone, regardless COVID-19 vaccination status, wear mask indoors immediate family.""

Not much enforceable, course. Stupid statistics actually prove opposite claiming. 

The ones getting vaccinated people lower social-economic status, middle-class (higher education average) getting vaccine. 

See twitter thread (in German): you? sweetie! mom (unvaccinated) blaming bleeding (vaccinated) saying I'm shedding even though I've explained literally impossible mRNA vaccine even linked article CDC's website still giving hard time... Sigh. Wearing masks regular part normal life going happen unreasonable expectation. 

Unfortunately there’s significant subset socially anxious / awkward people prefer face hidden pushing norm everyone. 

If people wanna wear mask that’s them.  one fucks rat. definitely ""oh shit"" moment western countries, proceeded tell still happen get smashed anyways. lol collective bargaining agreement maximums fines. guess could least measure anti-bodies blood, side-effects, possible long term issues. Precautionary principle ! Love it. Society would work much better functioned principle. Unfortunately politicians score easy points calling “government waste”. embarrassing now. Yeah think PCR pool testing, would nice tool west well imo. article appeared online Feb. 9 began seemingly innocuous question legal definition vaccines. next 3,400 words, declared coronavirus vaccines “a medical fraud” said injections prevent infections, provide immunity stop transmission article claimed, shots “alter genetic coding, turning viral protein factory off-switch.”

The First Amendment applies opinions, lies, deliberate misstatements, untruths (not counting legitimate journalism). Also statements meant panic inflame, yelling ""Fire!"" crowded theater. Moreover, applies government action. in, government cannot censure punish people stating opinions. cover civil lawsuits. Yes way would give vaccine children 

1. Already survived covid
2. healthy virtually zero risk die covid
3. unilkely transmit covid others

Risk exists every area life. risk needs put perspective need actually look data determine acceptable risk. Relative diseases simple every day activities, covid simply risk children warrants vaccine. Yes! them. also noticed receipt said discount $39.99 vs thought $30, aligns product too. Yes no. Flu obviously mutative viruses science behind flu vaccines known. super flu comes know fact make vaccine it.

The terrifying thing coronavirus past year, one history ever even made coronavirus vaccine humans.

If there’s virus families we’ve never made vaccines I’d want start those. Lottery systems going convince people better guaranteed cold hard cash. Put $2000 table vaccinated. immediate response paying people money works. panties still knot ""only"" worth half million. reiterate - _oh no, however cope_? 

Here's though, leaping defence explaining tough much money 20s.

So yeah, sounds exactly like celebrity worship.  Texan here. glorious state government dictated illegal schools mandate masks.

Also goes show different people world way different experiences virus. girlfriend got “off” work nobody flying work super busy us. never stopped working never went “true” lockdown speak. mandate it’s fully approved manufactures liable adverse effects case, comment. Sorry like that.  We're seeing transmission vaccinated individuals

I seen much this. link read? Peer reviewed research seems disagree modest differences vaccine effectiveness noted delta variant compared alpha variant receipt two vaccine doses. Absolute differences vaccine effectiveness marked receipt first dose. finding would support efforts maximize vaccine uptake two doses among vulnerable populations. (Funded Public Health England.). Yup, always 'it really effect children people' threads. magazine good enough you?  mexico rate today ? want poor give shit sure. wish US govt would bring stick out.  Fauci promoting roughly thing EcoHealth Alliance already doing? soon vaccine approved, giving shot 6 year old. vaccinate everything else (including flu shot every year). like travel family much possible. exposes us many things means lower chance contracting covid, even likely would suffer sniffle cough, better are. going Las Vegas (family event) week, unvaccinated (we vaccinated) wearing filter mask everywhere now. also wear masks safety crowded areas. But, again, soon shot available, get it. France isn’t multiple union state go federal mandates. Well, yes, Italy running maximum weeks. They're 500k+ shots day. good curve flattening maximum. horrible say, agree you. think anything rampant, even deadly variant COVID going anything get budge nonsense. thing gets affects people know. 

I seriously can't believe that's case, last five years craziness country, surprise. 'people like,' taxes public health measure used time.  That's truth know. Vaccinated people spread covid, much lower rate. 

Source? make sense. think push vaccination vaccinated people still catching COVID? millions vaccinated people, handful mild cases COVID. So, anything unless 100% effective? 

You're missing point vaccination. goal prevent illness, prevent death hospitalization. fact COVID vaccines incredibly effective preventing deaths hospitalizations COVID. That's goal, worthwhile reduce impact disease. vaccinated people still catching COVID, remarkably rare. And, data indicates highly unlikely vaccinated people spread COVID. Good point. Many people often forget factor. Severe illness easily trigger autoimmune conditions people well, leaving disabled life. would know, severe illness triggered autoimmune disease. Amazon mandate move needle. number sounded really low me. 
Mexico 37% positivity rate. thought par emerging economies, nope, worst. Worse Mozambique tied Myanmar ffs. Oh yes, course. travel without certain restrictions! need look friend living city Malta sounds fantastic cases != deaths. Netherlands example, less 5 children died due covid. condition cant get vaccinated, supposed protected people like vaccinated! 100% agreed. immune compromised 32 year old, selfishness reared head last year shocking. lies say? card carrying Moderna recipient, plague rat?  It’s apparent uk vaccines done little slow spread delta delta plus strain. Pretty sure France’s stick working better carrot. said want tax people 1k. That’s punishment.

I suggesting 2k everyone vaccinated anyone goes gets vaccinated. 

If another suggestion increase vaccination numbers ears, negative reinforcement going make drag heels more. That's I'm worried about.  get you’re well educated 50% nurses refusing vaccine probably ones like yourself. nurses don’t masters degree experience conducting research ones explicitly refusing vaccine despite data obviously aren’t able read studies interpret correctly they’re likely believe random Facebook poster.

But yes, nursing getting much rigorous hospitals pushing better educated nurses time I’m sure larger proportion nurses like yourself.

Again, mother RN she’s actually intelligent hard working can’t separate good data nonsense unfortunately. she’ll read random blog post article it’ll seem valid good study. That’s outside scope post. still lot least noisy minority vax alike politicians taking advantage people votes instead united pro vax line. Ill leave go normal life Sounds like didn’t trust government either, choice honestly think vaccine that's worse this? plenty anti-vaxxers actually believe covid covid casualty rate. mind boggling Hopefully everyone else wedding ok.   anyone delayed/lighter period infection? They’re overworked PANDEMIC!!! many doctors, pick slack tough times. quit, they’re kicking road making overworking problem even worse. thank highlighting fact doctors quitting contributing problem complain about. friend restaurant server died covid 8 months ago. everything right. Vaccines weren’t available yet. Single mom 2. Probably “dancing janssen” deal. first sounded bad let people get vaccinated go clubbing immediately thereafter caused spike cases. anyone wasn’t infected ordeal also vaccinated it’s weeks immunity since kicked in. apparently vaccinated quarter million people campaign.   I’m work phone. Please post portions first study relevant decreased transmissibility vaccinated. 

The second study least discusses topic, doesn’t sound like resounding evidence: index patients, vaccinated likely less severely symptomatic might less infectious unvaccinated.

I’m also curious isn’t discussed US all. seems like would help government push vaccinations. really hope CDC takes quick downturn delta countries consideration discussing revising mask policy. seems like situation US start improve fairly soon follow UK trajectory. Would really suck change rules right things get better, we’re definitely stuck masks till spring again. don’t even know primary goal type person you’re replying to. them, entire country set fire saves even one life COVID, anyone unwilling go along scenario worse Satan. There’s nothing wrong common sense measures reasonable reduce spread lighten burden hospitals regard ICU beds key resources, AFAIK point goal prevent every possible case death COVID. Like, let’s say close neighborhoods pizza joint, year-long period medium-sized community you’ll prevent what, couple dozen cases max? hundred? Makes sense. last words ""This hoax, real"". think clarity mind know succumbing to, good enough me. paying lip-service instead actually anything effective.

Unfortunately, lot liberals love lip-service actually get upset occurring. would even enforced? Guess what? 16 year old making minimum wage grocery store doesn’t give fuck someone coming vaccinated not. frankly shouldn’t job police We're dropping cases anyone else talked healthcare providers recently/nurses realize huge antivaxxers? I’ve getting back dating I’ve talked couple girls RNs major hospitals covid vaccines literally cannot comprehend that. Like deal work covid patients daily basis, really understand that.  look like it

falling faster previous wave Yea well say guy fake payed government give advice, 😂 . way learn get it, suffer learn. ones asymptomatic remain pain a**.  Way cases we’re aware testing. Testing way compared winter spring waves. charts looks like we’re early-ish stages upswing. He’s saying reality may closer peaking think based charts. Please spam comment multiple times attempt circumvent AutoMod believe children often asymptomatic mild cases, likely means number reported cases children far less actual number. Also, children aren’t hugely effected short-term still leave long-term effects, allow spread vulnerable people can’t get vaccinated, provide another opportunity virus mutate become even worse strain.

There’s reason developed world starts vaccinating people they’re babies, even aren’t highest risk group. risk vaccines almost 0, give potential benefits even small? vaccinated, go trip. waiting anti-vax morons get vaccinated go vacation, waiting rest life. Difference every country needs doctors. overwork underpay doctors, they're going stop working move country proper remuneration. Doctors saints offered protection taken advantage like every worker. Well sadly one antivax countries *Western* Europe, problem people Reddit believed meant half population nutjobs vaccinate.

I'm aware Google thank you. made claim, one back up. reason requiring masks buses transportation federally regulated [TSA lifted mask mandate public transportation. mandate scheduled expire Sept 13, would expect extended. Disney cautious requiring masks buses federal requirement. Duh! Measles, mumps, chicken pox, polio, small pox, way covid /s I'm aware of. get gold medal Rona. That’s awesome  no-brainer. you’re gonna around sick vulnerable people day, would insanely irresponsible unvaccinated. Hard answer, initial estimates we'd need 70-80% vaccination/natural immunity. Delta seems higher R0 might need toward upper end estimate.

I doubt anywhere close nation.

Also, remember hard numbers exact percentage needs be. Herd immunity likely reached anywhere anyway due high transmissibility delta variant. disagree him. Missouri first state get hit hard current delta wave cases even stopped rising there. states 2-4 weeks behind Missouri.

On bright side, many elderly vaccinated, don’t expect deaths high wave previous ones. Weird, rule 4 says topic posts? discussing healthcare policies topic coronavirus seems topic.

That's part watch (American) football past season. intention giving ratings something happened first place. want watch Olympics sake keeping modern history, want watch reason mentioned football. Well opinions. say totally controlled able leave country year half total lockdown success. would say failure. Seems like Soviet Union 1960s. call success. sorry, I’m Texas, feel pain. vaccines protect severe illness death

Non-sequitur I’m genuinely wondering big deal keep around safe.

I vaccinated. There’s plenty people ventilators ICU right due covid

Yeah. **intensive care** opposed early days everyone would get ventilator. I'm talking unlikely end one already unlikely get severe case anyways. Perfect. be. 97% vaccinated would push us towards safer community generally.

I'm stressing baby October staff vaccinated not. Yet antivax nurses (online) keep insisting babies born crazy amazing immunities can't get Covid. Like, that's something I'm willing risk... Well, sort of. Remember breakthrough COVID, relatively rare, exist. protecting anti-vaxxers, also sooorta protecting everyone else.

And vaccines protect severe illness death. COVID going eradicated, ship sailed long time ago summer they’re particularly annoying wear wearing 8 hours work sucks time year. don’t hate wearing stores it’s unpleasant I’m worried health point I’m fully vaccinated. don’t want wear mask protect people refuse get vaccinated. Props Italy! confusing. Everything pointed towards us peaking 100,000 cases minimum yet seems peaked half plummeting. Good lord man I’m going collate every single study you. plenty outlining more. Every single sign points toward myriad complications consider beyond dying COVID. It’s also common fucking sense. COVID causes inflammation multiple systems. Inflammation = bad. Feel free take anti-vax bullshit Darwin route insist, tho. 11 year olds celebrating birthday weeks early year... figure out, let us know. target demographic study, described exactly hate social interactions zoom. I'll put virtual meetings work school, draw line personal social interactions via Zoom showing needed access. 

And fwiw I'm outgoing person, needed in-person interaction ever last year. Virtual interaction substitute in-person interaction. wasn’t Biden appointee. US way large. may happen regionally doubt happen across country whole. variant developed *yet*, longer take get control, chances one developing.   wear N95. 

It obviously helps others masking. I’m genuinely wondering big deal keep around safe. 

And what? There’s plenty people ventilators ICU right due covid. talking  Even summer started 3 weeks earlier official calendar start, beginning June, we'd still going back school middle summer since season lasts 3 months. noted countries mention _very high_ vaccination rates. We're talking ~70% whole population ~85% adults.

Only Denmark, Iceland Malta also [in rest world protection... yet. Yes, believe pandemic serious, quit filling hospitals disease even believe in. Ride home. fine (according you).

Well, sort of. Remember breakthrough COVID, relatively rare, exist. protecting anti-vaxxers, also sooorta protecting everyone else.

Pointless anecdote time! ""first COVID"" knew one person got it. ""delta resurgence"" know two people, vaccinated (and trust truthful that).   people liking means get inhale aerosols increases chances getting sick. think pretty obvious.

Get vaccinated already. Wear N95. Take responsibility well instead relying others you.  ….yay? seek medical services 🤔 Good Gotcha. recently took micro heavy emphasis epidemiology immunity whole section vaccines. Possibly teacher tailored curriculum to, know...(gestures vaguely everything) HÀ NỘI – Hà Nội Lung Hospital locked deep-cleaning extensive testing 14 positive coronavirus cases detected Sunday night.

Previously, early May, two medical facilities locked cluster infections found Kim Chung facility National Hospital Tropical Diseases Đông Anh District, Tân Triều facility National Cancer Hospital (frequently called K Hospital) Thanh Trì District. VNS anything vaccine. hate idea things banned it.  probably specified average indonesian access vaccine. I'm talking limited knowledge though, able get vaccinated Mexico, assumed similar there. really back claim long covid hitting vaccinated people.

Generally speaking Long Covid understood lingering persistent effects initial illness passes. heard vaccinated people persistent effects like I'd like see source it. said cases lag much less deaths, symptoms present little two three days, encouraging we're seeing jump early days. fully vaccinated people virus survivors still catch transmit virus somewhat complicates calculation need herd immunity. Repeats breakthroughs turn number even fuzzier was. Seems like UK Gov hit sweet spot nobody knows why, lol. make clean political somehow. one side starts freedoms blah blah. concept made political. People normally law order comitting asult masks  Source? personally know “a handful” vaccinated people contracted Covid.

Far, far easier believe lying. ones know 40. people liking means get inhale aerosols

Wear N95. Take safety hands important outweighs ending ventilator

It March 2020, use much anymore. really truly hope stay down. happy see week’s numbers. good thing sense less drastic ceiling delta variant wave many countries approach virus meant likely lot asymptomatic cases weren’t picked testing. Coupled vaccination efforts, viral resistance likely much widespread borne existing case vaccination numbers.

It bad thing, however, haven’t gotten vaccine aren’t certain COVID previously, probably going get soon… reach new normal.  I’m thinking alcoholics driving bar known good judgment following laws HÀ NỘI – number COVID-19 infection cases Việt Nam risen 7,882 new cases Monday, Ministry Health announced.

This choosing beggars situation makes want cry seriously way hot summer. bring 50 degree days  read studies, listen public health authorities tell change anything I'm   mean good that’s representative basically anyone know

I didn’t see 10 people without mask stores year Philly. it’s MAYBE 5% people. people certainly don’t seem want wear masks took second allowed to. Including millions vaccinated people Get vaccine. virus good. people liking means get inhale aerosols increases chances getting sick. think pretty obvious. 

The slight inconvenience throwing mask way door, wearing common areas grocery stores far outweighs ending ventilator. don’t get everyone compare two outcomes wanted banger 2021 summer pandemic behind us.

Well, they're anyway.

I got back Outer Banks *never* 30+ years seen like year. absolutely insanely crowded. one wearing masks, every restaurant bar store packed capacity 100% time. nights literally could get food, 6PM calling pizza place told earliest pickup 10PM taking orders night.

The cat's bag IMO. general public going back ""normal"", Delta damned. Vaccinated people sick making sacrifices help morons, unvaccinated never gave fuck begin with. given extremely low rates serious illness death among vaccinated individuals, feels like us done everything right forced protect people done literally nothing protect since March 2020.

And there's end sight. live St. Louis mask mandates back. local leaders endgame. clearly defined goal finally take again. I'm starting get feeling end game impossible reach vaccination threshold.  Animal farming dangerous humans multiple ways

Including wet markets, Covid originally suspected originated. Personally mind I'm air conditioned building winter, work I'm lifting heavy packages day hot trailer 90+ degrees outside hell.

I dealt last summer really would like least get one mask mandates return.   mean - they've trying time years. There's weird programs MERS, sudan virus, lots ones. They're targeting anything that's scary - something mutate ready pivot like mRNA teams did. careful, know flute been. Forza Italia! center allow exemptions legitimate medical reasons? mandated vaccines, want make sure harm people genuinely can't get it. matter? people like them. bother people like them? see type person always going focus negative aspects everything. really am. 

These kids usually get nervous shots sometimes cry painful ones, pulled drive vaccine center, rolled sleeves stuck window said ""DO IT!"" Clinically Mild means need hospitalized. 

It mean sniffles.  exception this, would argue, would previous infection. research I've seen supports this. Switzerland..and even 50% vaccinated.  “Showing even larger disparity, CDC estimates week ending August 14, average 10,000 infections day 100,000.”

Yeah, clue way go lol  Oh god hope so. It’s people begging back first started: take medicine, get lives. It’s frustrating. Many us healthcare industry got shot afraid dying caring people. least feel like I’m risking death time walk work, that’s pretty low bar set. read?

I medical professional read studies - one looked Long Covid symptomatic vaccinated patients - turns thing - larger study Yale. 

But I'm sure think vaccine would protect ravages COVID get it. literally prevents dying. Missouri even much immunity? vaccine numbers stupidly low don’t think lot natural immunity begin  unvaccinated, restaurant bar would place likely spending significant amount time large group strangers unknown vaccination status indoors masked. anyway care. never care.  LOL, believe means approximately dick. imagine CDC waiting entire existence one moment fucking badly become worlds joke. failed provide timely counts infections deaths, provided test kits faulty put us back months, hesitated absorbing lessons countries - including asymptomatic carriers spreading infection, it’s leadership barely visible, there’s transparency, it’s advice directives months late it’s messaging confusing, hell asked lies former administration perpetuated said, quote, “it’s culture intervene”. moment became bureaucratic weighed hierarchy, became worthless. can’t imagine looking CDCs logo remembering badly fucked up, frankly continue fuck up. What? got vaccinated could go out. I’m still sure whether get not. don’t trust medical system? infection got misdiagnosed doctors one finally got right. nyc. 

And even prescribed strong antibiotic didn’t even cure it. antibiotics toxic still side effects 3.5 later till today. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Remember get vaccinated vaccinated person might get sick virus vaccinated vaccinated.

makes sense! probably got unvaccinated person, so… maybe around vaccinated people good thing. time schools send kids back 2 weeks now, masks required. literally know one else vaccinated late December. work healthcare super sure protected 6+ months.  vaccines add another layer good protection. Mandate vaccines, mandate PPE something similar, except sticker indicates received Covid vaccine and/or flu shot put interacting employees ease. regularly take five year old bars? waaaay super hard track minor breakthrough cases, many getting tested figure allergies something else. 3% breakthrough cases tested 75% tested ones come back severe hospitalized, that's going useful data. track ones matter. Like showing papers proving you’re 21? Showing papers proving car insured? 
This isn’t targeting “protected class”. keeping employees customers safe can. zoom calls static pictures everyone's faces.  lower stress lets concentrate someone's tone voice rather little picture that's low frame rate anyway. mean ""tied taxable income""? 1000 times infectious would make infectious disease human history ridiculous margin. Everyone thinks they're healthy enough handle they're ICU.

99% survival 99% without damage. Chronic lung problems, strokes/clots, neurological damage associated serious COVID cases point, several % higher death, even heathly people.

Meaning might ""fully healthy"" now, got around 3-5% chance ever able say *again* catch COVID without defenses place. Well assumption guess. like types people. culture pros cons. instance really enjoyed Peruvians met visited. knew someone would come Harris quote, seems resurgence lately. never anti vax way right is. quote trust Trump's recommendation without endorsement health experts. would say, coin phrase, ""that makes smart"".

And actually vaccinated December, Trump president. get people might doubts new vaccine (even unprecedented scientific effort behind it), looking big picture, undeniable success vaccines, I'm starting run patience people vaccinate. time worry hurting people's feelings. economy crumbling non covid ailments exploding vaccination way out. conspiracy theorists gonna field day one truly pity acknowledge stick around take massive amounts downvotes rather deleting comments running back echo chambers like many anti-vaxers. else could changed last week move +50% weekly growth (R~1.25) -20% (R~0.85)? would need 1/3 unvaccinated population infected make move, simply happened course week, right? sure wish could get children vaccinated.  Daaaamn that's rough countries... was, thinking good enough. Ima proud 😁 nurse sister law vaccinated never stopped eating indoors. doctor says “science opinion” would last time saw him/her guess point trying make trying accomplish goal (run car) best know basic info goal. vehicle fuel never learned refuel vehicle probably good thing know fuel put vehicle. Also idea automatically assume unvaccinated anti vax. obviously need enemy fight feel like right position guess. difference don’t automatically see enemy. Peace ✌️ I'm surprised I'm Italian see way, least talking people... puts things perspective, knowing worse places 😅 find mentality huge red flag relationship over. stop wanting best person start thinking ""just wait show everyone else button shirt wearing Homer Simpson Japan shirt..."" ""fine, dont listen take licence away, sure wont driving work every morning!"" 

I think point here. cared them, wanted best, thought logic would enough point plain disrespectful making obviously wrong choices ones negatively effect rest us longer give fuck saving actively want something bigger show right wrong. also learned almost never see way. understanding current understanding breastmilk antibodies provide protection viruses bacteria entering gut, seem enter bloodstream provide protection respiratory diseases. significant number window lickers suggesting natural immunity opposed vaccination. I'm saying one them, however. Right. answer. ask respond accordingly. far one nurse one place I've willingly answered. asked please make sure different nurse present appointment time. *HIPAA think incentives starting less effective now. California massive push lotteries free prizes vaccination rate plateau. Long definition Immunity changed good. worries! I've staring ""buy whole table"" offerings last month so, waiting see round enough friends fill seat, lol. What's funny fact implementation COVID vaccine passport nothing new (e.g., Denmark mandating either negative test vaccinations eat restaurants quite now), yet people know France like something new, thanks stupid people protesting.  Let’s focus top level issue: shouldn’t go unvaccinated raging pandemic unless really good, verified medical reason to.

And yes, incredibly small percentage people shouldn’t go bars restaurants.

As wife: we’re fully vaccinated still staying populated indoor spaces like bars restaurants. don’t want mild moderate case covid still quite possible breakthrough infections. yeah write exactly read comments. another one detached reality. waste time. Rather wear tinfoil hat respirator. would assume read it, you’re smart enough received vaccine. absolutley does...when everyone vaccinated! agree currently abysmal US Vax rates spread. everyone needs get vaxed least ...wear mask. even remotely true. Vaccinated people want get back normal life. point getting one. Yes - creating punitive fine impacts groups trouble getting vaccine already dis trusting government correct approach.

400 dollars week could food budget next month.

Also - say scientist means jack shit.

Rand Paul says thing, Dr Oz, love line guy. 

I FINE weekly testing (and make place offer spot vaccination shots small incentive). fine punishing people breeds distrust, amongst group already distrustful. serves push away.

I’d OK say tying vaccination say unemployment benefits food stamps see low income population low vaccination rate, I’m willing go far punitively punish people.

Corporations school districts force enough people moot anyway.

“Show vaccinated, wear mask want enter” better policy pay 400 week PCR test. back again? We’ve plenty times understood point. moronic unfounded point easily dismantled. understand it, got boner blonde mountain boys. I'm arguing masks. I'm arguing non-trivial number people saying everyone stay home, think pulling kids school, etc. thread, threads, real life.

My comment, replying, states risk injury traffic accident way / school likely higher long term injury attendance school possible COVID exposure children without condition makes susceptible severe COVID. Thanks letting know!!  people never target campaigns like that. idea get people fence, hardcore idiots. mean folks received two doses mRNA also get Johnson &amp; Johnson? get 70% statistic?… Avoid reposting information, please. \~20+% positivity community, leaders encourage testing symptoms, count vaccinated positives. would even settle encouraging people stay home ""cold"" well could COVID given level community spread here. Vulcans CDC consider American Human behavior. Logic dictates drop mask mandate vaccinated surely unvaccinated would want get shot wear mask anymore, right? right? 

Nope. happened, shockingly, unvaccinated stopped wearing masks walking virus vectors feeding varients. england arwnt testing clubs though Honest gosh, need sort ""The Know"" 60 second TikTok, YouTube, TV spot this. Probably never, think reasonably likely either current Delta wave likely subsequent fall/winter increase cases last time Covid prominent issue developed world. 

Once becomes consensus 1) reasonably high vaccine uptake eliminates possibility mass hospitalization/death 2) disease going eradicated (which probably happen start seeing trajectories similar UK's current one), think gradually see Covid morph secondary/tertiary issue discourse; something gets bottom right blurb front page WSJ every couple weeks vs. big section several times week currently. I'm sorry hear going that. mind asking is? found relief answers it?

I similar boat. dealing year-plus long bout long covid. sucks. think ""enemies"" petty pathetic God kind people really makes angry. drowning immune system good idea? Idiot Think businesses perspective. best interest limit customers (and sweet cash baby)? SF papers show now

* Vax status (to protect staff patrons)
* IDs (because bars get effed man serve minors)

besides that, everyone welcome ""pandemic"" part ends enough people world get vaccinated and/or virus flames out.

I fully expect COVID offspring become seasonal thing since widespread throughout world now, get point first. country back ""normal"" week. take 2 weeks data show effects that? Sounds tad early celebrate personally. satisfying may be, UK doesn’t make individuals pay hospital beds form taxation. Universal healthcare that. Admission clinic refused vaccine come complimentary punch face. fair, honor system requires participants least agree validity system itself. 30% country not. sounds like important factor “purposeful” , say. would make sense - people like feel productive.  Addo Seattle enforcing this. Here's upvote talking sense. People like sense Reddit. stay sister positive. measures, masks. share cigarettes two days ago tried coffee. morning test. Negative Unfortunately go work daughter high risk.   Stay home high risk. confirm; VA employee received directive today. (for reference, work Finance, patient care, fully vaxxed well direct reports). flabbergasted amount direct patient care employees refuse vaccination, even offer us paid time getting shots recovery side effects.

The straw may broken camel’s back recent outbreak VA Law Enforcement Training Center Little Rock. VA cops US required go LETC Little Rock mandatory job training. 1 person infected go LETC 3 month POST, it’s going run like wildfire, isn’t mandate wear masks LETC like medical center buildings. Flu shot made mandatory last year, pretty much waiting mandatory covid vaccine announcement dropped. makes sense send (U.S.) since (auto mod removed post profane word) people take them. Stay home high risk. vaccine passports great idea businesses would able create safe environments vaccinated chose so. bullshit unfair unvaccinated nonsense unvaccinated assholes caused another surge. Yes 21 days vaccination maybe I'm lucky! US States 16% fully vaxxed no? NE Florida here.  Shouldn’t people upset unvaccinated people spreading Delta instead policy makers sworn duty protect public safety?

No elected official takes decisions like lightly. elected official would reinstitute mask requirement unless seeing data show mask prevent many unnecessary deaths among unvaccinated, they’re probably pretty damn pissed conspiracy theorists idiots getting sick. 

Enough blaming public officials mask mandates. It’s last thing want think they’re “security theater” bs reason, projecting motivations don’t exist. 40? article read like people 40s. Thought teenagers. Someone Florida got felony wouldn’t play around hard. I'll give cure money/jewelry/your house etc. Nah, LA already stated enforce new mandate police, St. Louis suburbs. hate hear child condition. would make feel safe? 80 cents legit n95. Breakthrough infection? pleasant Us logical parents fucking terrified. I've pretty spot realism pandemic duration etc, even getting smacked fact year somehow dangerous kids last. mean least someone marketing background. Doctors scientists work around stuff time may best messengers average person. Beautiful numbers, LOVE NUMBERS sure post upvoted. Children dying. Teachers vaccinated. Schools open. Polio affected people overtly obvious ways. COVID disease death takes place privacy. time different. series wars actually reached American masses happened. gives rise community minded attitude experience.

But also… polio effects apparent many cases life-long debilitating.

The disease course COVID deaths COVID take place relative privacy without extensive publication.

People often afraid disability disfigurement death. Masks vaccinated OPTIONAL.

Point blank. Period. going backwards.

Get vaccine. percentage player's salary? That's drop bucket star, decent chunk guy minimum. 200 die bad flu season. kids dying always awful, 297 3.6 million could hell lot worse

idk sound like fucking asshole typing  Except saying sub constantly saying CDC (and anyone disagreed downvoted oblivion sub DEFINITELY overrun bad faith covid deniers) predictably backfired terribly stupid logic assumes masks horrible thing literally small piece cloth even notice.  Heard James Carville Brian Williams night. said....

""I'm planning going UCLA-LSU football game early September, anti-vaccine knuckleheads fuck me, I'm going really pissed."" never said long term effects COVID due pneumonia. said that's particular case sounds like. family fully vaccinated. live area 70% adults vaccinated. cases low 1.2% positivity rate. zero restrictions. Get vaccinated. don't. summer fine. Maybe, maybe not. agree premise sense people got J&amp;J, would hard parse meaning anecdotally. LOT people got Moderna, it’s identical Pfizer, despite it’s often treated media. Bigger dose size (over 3x active ingredient Pfizer) plus longer dosing schedule could lead higher efficacy Moderna Pfizer.

It’s impossible say without real data, I’d say it’s likely factors effect they’re not. words, coin flip. 

There’s also another confounding factor Pfizer approved deployed Moderna, even week head start could make difference vaccines waning efficacy.

TL;DR agree there’s basis conclude anecdotal reports. likewise there’s reason conclude Pfizer=Moderna (when comes current situation) absence empirical data. different vaccines all. It’s either situation. leave house get sick. saying want catch cold get sick?? Probably not.

I want healthy feel good. big part catching kind sickness proper precautions healthy immune system.

Things like

Washing hands

Not sticking hands eyes 

Exercise 

Eating well

Sleeping well

Managing stress anxiety 


Yes , leave house. often, also  (For foreseeable future)

Wear mask inside

Stay away large gatherings random people.   ""Trust verify."" :) Everyone know still wears mask vaccinated. People get shot also care spreading around deadly virus, course mask up. science supposed believe?

That kids die covid, low numbers. (300 US last year.). Thousands kids end hospital, many chronic conditions, misc-c (akin Kawasaki syndrome, long covid.  We're beginning study it, ""science yet in."" say. favor, try let kids get this. Mask up! stay safe get vaccinated. good news probably die covid. bad news - get everything heart damage, lung damage, kidney damage brain damage know little long term effect health. Yeah we’re ready jump full online learning yet. mean it’s ok theory, requires far effort still falls well short students get classroom. teaching classroom year, masks anything. delta came we’ve back online past two months :/ trying convince remote learning good person learning, I'm already convinced.

If trying convince infecting millions unvaccinated kids parents families coronavirus somehow best way go, guess that's disagree. wife thought caught last week. Turned strep.    Kids dying permanently iron lungs frightening thing parents. don’t know live, today doc said 1 50 asymptomatic people carriers SF. FwIW think right thing given don’t want child infected.

WRT breast milk, note don’t say long happens but:

“Results: cohort 6 lactating women received 2 doses SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, observed significantly elevated levels SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG IgA antibodies breast milk beginning Day 7 initial vaccine dose, IgG-dominant response.


Conclusions Relevance: first show maternal vaccination results SARS-CoV-2 specific immunoglobulins breast milk may protective Damn didn’t think tbh. could well it. that’s case hope least take medication like Benadryl it. swab many teacher Los Angeles refuse ever consider getting vaccinated, stating God protected far, continue future. also say got sick believing God didn’t believe enough. *sigh* Wow, I’m vaccines, seriously flawed mathematical reasoning here. best conclude data 1141 died *so far*. idea many 161million vaccinated people even exposed fact, history United States 34 million people officially disease, around 1.8 million month, that’s probably generous estimate since we’ve fairly COVID free area least whole time I’ve vaccinated - assuming vaccines widely available 4 months 1141 people vaccinated died time, that’s closer 0.02% 1 every 5000. Much better 2 per 100 see unvaccinated let’s understate risk. one 5000 risk dying plane crash, you’d probably choose drive. People still vigilant, even vaccinated."
