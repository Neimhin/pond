0,2021-02-21," Well obviously extremely effective, really can't say much effective compared AZ one, direct comparison studies. know mean get sick, help stop spread virus. population Canada population California. 1 mil doses administered Canada vs 7 million California.

For fairness, see state ran conservative doing: Texas near 3 mil doses.

I ready defend Canada topic. face facts... even state like Texas, can't deliver water electricity residents, 3 times effective delivering vaccine. Oooof. ‚òπÔ∏è Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* WTF must answer question see article??? first :) They're starting injections super, super late relying really heavily hard shock lockdowns week entire cities case found wild. I'm happy grandpa back home Australia safe worry they're going winter nothing hope stop virus that's endemic around world ever reaching shores. 

I'm glad everyone's healthy buy best way going it, there's lot damage done. emergency approval means UK vaccines batch tested release.

It's beyond irresponsible MP refer vaccines rushed. pandemic anything increases vaccine hesitancy going kill people.

Australia done excellent job controlling virus, point (after everyone offered vaccine) open borders let virus in. Vaccine sceptics sitting ducks. stated lie. Here's link 2 seconds Google. thinking backpedal stance due public outcry. 

I zero clue many people thread want suck Trump's dong. definitely undercounted difference would vaccinating teachers make? They're one person room 30 kids can't get vaccinated. Almost major glasses retailers owner, ultimately, Luxottica (sp?). They're huge monopoly indeed find cheaper online. Get someone get accurate measurements glasses. government tried negotiate Pfizer wanted save money. SAVE MONEY VACCINE VIRUS LITERALLY HALTS WORLD.
Now mostly rely vaccines. That's problem though, much much more.
My mother one first germany get vaccinated sign 5 pages long declaration sorts statements. real mess here. Absolutely this. Wahhhh I'm depressed life perfect right mentality deserve happiness. Londoner here. Holy shit yes. I'm sorry misunderstood country's strategy. Clearly know what's happening better (I'm North America never even Sweden, really want go one day). understanding chief medical officer's strategy protect elderly isolate. younger people get go lives relatively restrictions goal keeping economy open building herd immunity younger population overtime. media would basically talk ""herd immunity strategy"" every day. none true? missed milestones addition every part bull crap, temporary, reality. whole event traumatizing huge part world. missed milestones stand sea trauma like buoys. I'm affected scenario age, sympathize populations socially deprived burdened. looks much - different flavors impact. context HS College student social deprivation, signaled loss traditional milestones. sad. 

I glad thriving hope find peace past. Genuinely, hope well. know pain carrying tough past hopeful find way.  like 'new normal' gang ensure everyone terrified even cases low hundreds countries Go therapy lol Sadly think production capabilities limited, remember one science subreddits lengthy explanation making modern mRNA vaccines way harder shaking mushroom spores vial stirring hands hurt, enough sell license expect produce million doses week. sure hope license laboratories around world. wake, funeral, birthday party. worth suffering going bring communities?

With vaccines available, maybe sacrificed get vaccines first? seems pretty unfair reward stupidity. supposed instead? People don‚Äôt really like sit around grieving endlessly know may feel way right but... there's plenty fish sea. mean, point Pfizer vacccine tested millions people Israel, real-world conditions. better data could possibly ask for? Exactly. happened 1910s lockdowns, honestly think would locked '80s well. really wish sides well. long hoped Israelis Gulf States would buy Sinai Egypt move Palestinians name Palestine. won‚Äôt love idea could return many people wanted. Israel gets West Bank get peace.  emergency approval definition rushed even justified case. rushed it'd normal approval. likely trend concerning raw #, seen fast thing grow Nope. Help Lockdowns already done US return. previous ones ignored masses, something like would impossible enforce. would zero chance forced close government Ironic comment. don‚Äôt really give shit what‚Äôs happening UK Europe. comment Canada‚Äôs relationship EU, correct. Europe export controls vaccines, Canada exempt.

They currently supplying vaccines, better none. Canada fortunate getting that.

I‚Äôd link source, bot deleted it... resident deaths 1,041 staff deaths, 99.1%. needs stfu actually Yeah cares academic reports actually ability curb virus? Yet dumbasses still say little flu. think India supposed supply huge shipment stopped African countries covishield (Oxford vaccine) effective specifically south african strain. least second shot given even efficacy like 66% afaik. useless also best considering people might start considering immune taking make worse. thinking going comments, reversed Canada beast far better US dropping ball, would comment section like? lack initiative lack supplies? think main point ‚Äúsexy grim reaper‚Äù isn‚Äôt easily attainable common Halloween costume, girls dress witches instead.

## ""Gritstone Oncology

Preclinical studies encouraging, showing high levels neutralizing antibodies immune-system responses."" ""struggle"" going prom classic college experience year.

Get grip.  wouldn‚Äôt hesitate. guess Trudeau knows best. people I'm calling pathetic ones who're supposedly traumatized get go prom college years ruined. Apparently minor inconveniences horrible traumatizing events.

It's literally ""I'm depressed I'm living best life"", pathetic way look it. Yeah I'd rather live Somalia Yah cus it‚Äôs safe 99 year old 9 year old. scientists need get clue  fair US needs way fck Canada far know started ramping things up. want move next big depressing thing. still peak levels first wave July spike. God work? feel like everyone work takes masks whoever they‚Äôre patients room lmfao  aren‚Äôt open?

They forced close government. significant portion population going out, there's nothing change short term.

When force business enforcement enforcement. They're always going act way helps themselves. Turning away potential customers self interests. think that's true. still averaging 1500-3000 daily deaths. Plus I'm ICU nurse. 4 people died Thursday. One shift. however get admission open 4 days! things getting better. I'm talking genetic defects slightest. People study lots information lifetime likely need sort corrective vision. Personally, I've known many scientists wear glasses contacts. people attach ""stigma"" ""stereotype"" people wear glasses smart. every cartoon scientists almost always shows wearing glasses.

Nothing wrong that. I'm saying lot smart people know wear glasses, good them! also know masks work, apply wear properly. I'm aware they're also persecuted. many 1.9M Palestinians vaccinated think? Haha yes, gonna argue main point. 

Just adding residual radiaton boar real, Cs-137 half life 30 years, still remember vividly unfortunate turn events lot stuff unloaded southern Germany. Cases declining globally, can't explained protective immunity vaccine numbers low. factor sure, seasonality likely bigger driver don‚Äôt really give shit what‚Äôs happening UK Europe. comment Canada‚Äôs relationship EU, correct. vaccinated first. Canada 30 million people
 Usa 340 million. course dead people. PEOPLE üòÇ Australia‚Äôs Chief Medical Officer, Paul Kelly, argued AstraZeneca vaccine still useful prevent death severe illness 100% time. reality, that‚Äôs claim supported science, AstraZeneca trial lacked statistical power evaluate endpoint. fact, two severe cases occurred trial, including one death (both placebo group).
We‚Äôd need much larger trial understand well AstraZeneca vaccine prevents severe disease. would provide larger number events needed distinguish significant difference placebo vaccine group.

I‚Äôm sort statistician epidemiologist. please explain statement article incorrect? seems like may point. infective variants likely bit higher 70% (given masks/social distancing). phrase ""had implemented..."" envision scientists officials saying things get ignored half population. supposition direction given FOLLOWED, things would different.

It actually true could reduced count 20K...that never cards country like United States, disorganized relaxed approach public health travel governance. leaders done best constituents, constituents followed best advice could get best ability, would certainly saved least American 100,000 lives.  lol yeah *that's* human rights violation Israel Hell yeah! No. live usa notice, spread going even counties lightly hit one cannot attribute herd immunity. Izrael cases really high even 4x vaccination. Uk strain doubling every 10 days usa even overall numbers going down.
 counties death rate 256 per 100k people still getting new cases whereas others 30 per 100k people still room grow.

I heard herd immunity talk since july different places, even sweden before. saying rather play little safe sorry later. dont buy herd immunity argument yet, especially targetted groups vaccinated form social bubble together. Yes really, buy vaccines get vaccinated, get rich Arab countries plenty vaccines like UAE. get form Arab countries border like Egypt Jordan recognized Palestine ""another country"" . think minimising struggles others unkind.  always left behind, one front Israel's campaign them. places Europe fact. talking about? Israel occupying lands claimed Palestina. That's I'd call disputed border. 

Israel least provide people occupy health-care provide citizens. course not, speaks volumes. Europe anymore. Tell it. supposed finish college studies last year delay graduation project year covid. havent seen girlfriend lives another country year pandemic would've moved together already I'd already job Canada population slightly less California; therefore, would probably make sense compare Canada California far vaccinations concerned. Buddy, infinitely worse people everywhere site.

Nothing I've said even particularly controversial. Please see [our answers frequently asked questions [questions regarding COVID-19 comments containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* mean sure, canada like 1/100 population US? pathetic it? disagree statement life ends 30. pandemic meaningful, impactful, difficult time ages. Thats take say. see comments across thread pathetic folks thriving. would like understand perspective.

On surface, thriving. Psychologically, not. make pathetic? Lost promotion, trip abroad, lots money. Could worse though started replying serious response probably can‚Äôt point map Israel, Egypt Jordan are.
For it‚Äôs worth Gaza way occupied Arab countries free provide vaccines Palestinians. UAE lots them. January 1 mostly everywhere, Europe flipped completely Europe last couple days. France, Germany, Poland, Netherlands Belgium reporting daily infection counts 30% higher last week. Uk here, think government notice USA news decided ramp up. Apparently July end here. states bidding PPE

They also secretly since fed coming taking too. Insane storylines thing. India here. We're bracing second wave. Wouldn‚Äôt easier laid back parents?

Anyway, wondering you‚Äôre proud behaviour Reddit. here, opened massive vaccination halls, used ""100 vaccines day"" less 1 since middle January. you, always feels little wrongly comforting hear someone similar spot, bad spot is. vaccines seem working great almost spring all, lot faith we'll soon. Stay safe. definitely sympathize people struggling time. are. idea inconvenience worth saving millions lives ridiculous.
I think find people far receptive social relationships coming months it‚Äôs worth. found therapy groups psychotherapy/psychiatric services near you? Keep mind vast majority see substantial improvement combine medications therapy bad thing? better underpromise over-deliver overpromise under-deliver. could use boost morale. live Texas. Curious snow storm knocking power across state. vaccines couldn‚Äôt stay temp quickly vaccinate Houston... anyone know anything it? concur. College kids deserve drink party go events make friends date. stay inside, college online. let anyone tell otherwise! solution continue lockdown, despite questionable efficacy, unquestionable costs increasing exponentially? There‚Äôs efforts step border closures tracing efforts, won‚Äôt be. can‚Äôt keep security theatre it‚Äôs killing society Every day counts! Congrats Malaysia. Let's go. We're easily going go 100 million shots 30th. get, better. Remember Biden Fauci emphasized 100 million baseline, goal. I‚Äôm getting ready normal summer. I‚Äôm making plans see friends go bars beach. One parents vaccinated, next coming within months. higher risk groups vaccinated Im going back life. point couldn‚Äôt give two shits covid, isolation destroying mind. Anyone wants tell otherwise go fuck themselves. agree type mask wearing becoming normalized, necessarily becoming expected. way things lot US, expected, people get dirty looks jumped sneezing sniffling without wearing mask, would entirely possible allergies. people Facebook accounts android phones, aren‚Äôt seeing forest trees. push people miss want see other's full face, expressions, smiles well mot wanting reminded pandemic time. get wait safe, thing people, even lot things reopen, may wait safe wear mask go much simply home almost like refuge things remind us pandemic. all, reason many people go fun things begin escape troubles, reminded (as restrictions) Yep. 

The thing enforced Disneyland. looks like overturned soon.  Correlation equal causation, correlation still relationship ...and it‚Äôs exactly right. Get vaccine don‚Äôt die get life back. 
Instead it‚Äôs nonsense bad joke community get vaccine, it‚Äôs still masks empty high school football games. costs lockdown greater covid

For young healthy people only, yeah lockdowns supposed last months. fact masks controversial, even questioning whether virus even real, lead extended lockdowns lack taking serious among causing death spikes.

Functioning societies saw lockdowns lasted couple weeks time even one. But, allowed relative normalcy between. Yeah personally believe anti-maskers LAST line get vaccine. Young old. 

Let people good behavior go first. 

But bad can't enforce this. now? one flatterers? would indeed big measles outbreak. trying normalise this? Today PA saw &lt;2000 cases &lt;2000 hospitalizations first time since 11/10/2020(for Hospitalizations) 10/26/2020(for Cases) Unfortunately think national plan wishful thinking you‚Äôre right. opinion it‚Äôs also catastrophic thinking disproportionate fear especially compared lot things young people do. psychological effects, social effects, sociopolitical effects going become clear slowly next decade. 

Will another roaring 20s, another post-9/11 world? I‚Äôll agreement there. lockdowns buy contract tracers healthcare facilities time prepare. Without proper testing, quarantining it‚Äôs hard get ahead seems wasn‚Äôt done. part puzzle. Australia strict lockdown followed strict quarantine testing. Serious question, kid used scratch lenses seem anymore. wore mostly contacts recently switch back glasses due eye issue. get special stuff lenses supposed backups. lenses improve better glasses wearer now? Never said that, implying felt peoples mental health consequences deal it. alone nearly year suicidal. stance ""HAHA FUCK GROW UP"". Influenza really responds social distancing obeying infection controls. go figure. know, screw believing man said wanted marriage family strung along lies five years! Still pretending stupid see. course. Pretty much standard operating procedure Israel. Palestinians are, always, second class citizen. Society going dealing fallout living like long long time . It‚Äôs going really bad 

You know who‚Äôs kids aren‚Äôt effected ? leaders elites champion lockdowns . kids getting max amount normal possible . It‚Äôs us normal folk get hit wrecking ball 15 planes went today,

Why insist making comparison? afraid flying something?

I mean, telling thought processes gauge risk, article below, ""humans pretty bad assessing risk""

I mean, put car accidents? ""2000 car accidents"" yesterday covid terms. Said way though I'm sure even saying ""who gives shit, car accidents happen time!""

Which point. Dramatics uninteresting me. covid means nothing. people know, even elderly, covid means nothing.

Making people feel guilty something business feeling guilty marketing tactic. fall depends goes. hope not! think need broaden mind little think it‚Äôs analogous argument. is. think overlap anti maskers anti vaxxers pretty strong. Would surprised wasn‚Äôt chronic kidney disease workplace let stay home 2 months last year? active measles pandemic killing hundreds thousands? friendly reminder ""Conspiracy Theorist"" term specifically created slander discourage people counter-narrative thinking. really interesting article. appreciate it.

I think drawing quite long bow apply rights purposeful vaccine deniers, learned something always try recognise people here. definitely failure Canada's part shame dropped production capability 80s profitable. working vaccine production Montreal now, that's plus, it'll take time.

I'm defending Canada here, quite opposite actually, think important honest what's actually going instead blaming easy scapegoats. first vaccine deal (Cansino) made worst political opponents (China) deliver, already late ordering doses Western producers. obviously, fault producers delivering, still wtf Trudeau  Trial ran 19-23 days. go shorter might make vaccine slightly less effective, doubt would different enough matter, first dose expected provide 90% protection itself. Clearly interest capability adult discussion all. I'm sure american problem experience (I'm 36) college great fun travelled world later nice income. Also save sabbatical, one best things did. offered vaccine working hospital valet. hope comes available rest us Americans soon Well, freakin shit lol. young presumably whole life ahead goes perpetually hold, course people going struggling mental health. Also, arguably young people lose terms major life events: school dances, graduations, going college, weddings, children, traveling, building financials, first jobs, cultivating friendships dating, etc etc thresholds change. summer suggesting northeast reached heard immunity. Winter comes along looks like wrong.

However, could still sort heard immunity summer. Winter changed things. get part.

But still, seeing anti-maskers get vaccine first feels like big slap face people make sacrifice like op said. California stop enforcement rules months. restaurants full inperson dining. gyms arw fully open indoors. state never intention enforcing restrictions serious level. oh.. plenty stupid Canadians...

 isolated incident America dealing with. it. cold 3 days sit hands feeling fine week. 
No fever. yeah. value life poor grocery store worker value vaccine denier. 

&amp;#x200B;

As well life teh pregnant mother, children allergic vaccine more.

So science denier order online. something. You‚Äôre completely ignoring anxiety whether contract spread potentially deadly disease unsuspecting people family community. depression following losing family member disease propagated people lazy wear mask undisciplined socially distance. Well really speak regarding state (Victoria) since different states different rules, generally think government taking cautious approach comes lifting restrictions. five day lockdown small spike cases UK strain, think things like social distancing, indoor mask requirements, capacity limits still around least time bulk people gotten vaccine, even caution. 

Then again, maybe I'm cynical. Last year accepted fact pandemic going go least years, guess I'm little wary jumping vaccines miracle solution. Even last year remember hearing vaccine necessarily mean pandemic over. Thank god got bars open tho! create value customers shareholders! /s US deaths per million far countries. Literally nobody serious disputes Florida's data. Even GoFundMe grift queen Rebekah Jones, started undercount conspiracy theory, reports basically exact numbers Florida's official count website. case don‚Äôt know, scientists compare data certain event point time said event point time, order see changes occur within population. Since talking young people‚Äôs mental health pandemic, safe assume baseline would mental health pandemic, no? baseline might ‚Äúcracking up‚Äù prior, doesn‚Äôt undermine much worse pandemic made it. example, many studies shown technology, specifically social media, increases depression anxiety among young adults. imagine much worse pandemic made phenomenon pushing lives virtual setting. seen menstruation studies, Pfizer Moderna reported normal pregnancies volunteers. Salary based contract believe. Except texas. expect people do? Stay isolated friends family forever? dont think app atleast get card saying vaccinated hear hear. pendantic arsehole. limiting two specific zip codes less beauracratic letting anyone eligible county go there? Floridians like allowed question decisions elected officials made elected officials California suck? Otherwise see relevance bringing California here. Probably blessing disguise. COVID stressor human experiences who‚Äôs say another challenge would precipitated mental health crisis? think many young adults started still struggling feel self sufficient world, sudden everything changes. It‚Äôs new norm, realistically, much miss never come back. That‚Äôs amazing hear! masks still required?? existing immunity. 

I keep bringing people like bring race.

No, I'm suggesting race anything it. I'm suggesting parts world experienced sort cross reactive coronavirus within lifetime. Probably last couple years. could explain places make much bang. Low R value, low infection severity. People still trusting judgement? Canada come keep up! brings 50 plane crashes day *only* 15 plane crashes day 50 crowd. That‚Äôs still 100,000 Americans. 

15 planes went today, 15 went yesterday, it‚Äôs big, people die everyday.

I‚Äôm afraid murderer, lazy hurt ones love, much less complete stranger grocery store. 

We think differently responsibilities loved ones communities. 

If parents vaccinated get vaccinated, conversation really doesn‚Äôt matter. Dude, can't really physical health without mental health. Stop acting like they're independent other.

Please read comments thread get basic understanding privileged able say things touch reality are. ***highest risk*** Sometimes girl's decision. friend who's 34 recently left spouse 5 years. handle mental health crisis experienced lockdowns. mid-30s single, still wanting badly become mother might never chance. talking Florida here, NY.
  
Florida done excellent seeing 2nd oldest population country ine dense, yet bottom half country per capita deaths. 
  
Florida great success story. able keep businesses schools open also protecting vulnerable populations. 'NoVax"" Serbian fans. 

That guys brain cancer. based R0 virus. 1 - 1/R0

So virus R0 4. 1-(1/4) = 0.75 75% herd immunity. think hitting 4m per day mid Feb. appears Pfizer &amp; BioNTech trying ramp J&amp;J start shipping US. get vaccines? I‚Äôve quarantined since March last year toddler would love recover sense normalcy could also happen kind reaction vaccine alcohol could make worse  likely reached herd immunity then. Canadian Federal governement fucking useless power-grabing entity never achieves anything. want keep much power provinces themselves, never achieve anything give shit anyone voters (liberals=Ontario / Conservatives=Western Provinces). literally fucking suck every possible issue happens always 10 years late every thing USA! USA! USA! Fauci said vaccines key stopping mutations. naive believe virus would stop replicating causing mutations? essential worker. May seem obvious, definitely are! ‚ÄúObese people die COVID can‚Äôt bothered bare minimum‚Äù - sound like btw required, strongly recommended you‚Äôre going city mosquito season. cases mild, 1/4 fatal. articles you‚Äôre reading sound like they‚Äôre likely anti-vaccine falsehoods. may want critical articles whatever linked then, mRNA vaccine cannot change DNA. That‚Äôs whole point. never enters cell‚Äôs nucleus, limited damage long term. fact, works close virus infects you, except chopped bits convinces body react real infection took parts replicate itself. FeelsBadMan canada america always competition. seriously nice job americans that's actually pretty good. can't get people comply killing 4000 people day.  Acting like anyone would actually abide social distance naive. time let guard down. thread r/AgedLikeMilk finest art way law restricted access works, like under-age drinking. emergency use anything? still emergency, still things locked down, vaccinated people exempted. confirm glasses always get fogged breath escaping top mask. like think there's positive pressure around eyes preventing bacteria reaching them.  No, people reasonable, vaccines numbers dropping like stone. makes angry see Baby-Boomers live taking vacations refusing wear masks younger generation sacrificed much them...

Wait hear global warming. entire population remained lock-down entire population vaccinated. Serious question, ever vaccine 95% effective rate stop spread virus?

I understand wanting wait ""science"" seems crystal clear vaccine stops Covid tracks. Yep, opens question extent society protect people gotten vaccine despite clear opportunity so? would argue little, room ethical debates, especially around small populations people cannot get vaccinated.

The key question going forward simply reaction smaller-scale outbreaks fall/winter. worth super trigger-happy shutting things down, let go? lots variables regarding outbreak seems strain evade vaccines stuff like that. general, despite somebody generally pro-lockdown least early days, fear conservative intolerant degree virus circulation.  acting like baby? Regulators super important job. make decisions based best judgement, German regulator sees lack trial data effectiveness AZ 65's genuinely understandable decision make decide approve without data. Letting potential public perception issues affect important decision bad idea if, hypothetically, they'd approved ages want hurt vaccine's reputation data came say suitable? That'd huge problem. Ironically that's advocating. many people died virus already want check let accelerate already affected many people. Sunk cost fallacy. realize Israel smaller land mass population states US? centralized scale small state likely cant centralized scale country 30x large. wash hands, flu shots, paid sick time, understand quarantining spread influenza type viruses. preprint published Edinburgh university website, statistics sophisticated takes adequate account concerns. They‚Äôve done basically say you‚Äôd [Yes, still studies determine people vaccinated still spread it. Frequent poster r conservative. tell everything need know. moved early.

Europe US broadly waited get bad, degree ""we'll learn live it"", followed ""lock lock down"", followed ""we'll learn live it"", followed ""oh God hurts"", followed ""lockdown lockdown"".

Indecision kills, covid exception. CA proof vaccination Measles, Mumps &amp; Rubella required children attend public middle school. people think fucked ones problem end home-schooling kids sending private school.

Once children vaccinated Covid requirement attend school person might well get used it. hope so, would amazing! Same. think they‚Äôre saying people get first shot, opposed fewer people getting doses. Like lied masks necessary medical professionals could stock them. 

I‚Äôll getting second dose according previous schedule (4 weeks later). interested impact Covid Sweden, including January February adds irrelevant data. Deaths January, February beginning March, skews/offsets much deaths since then. makes 2020 seem normal was. 

Frankly, looking excess death without cause simple yield interesting data anyway. needs viewed cause. Ah listen. I'm certainly alluding certainly case, I'm 100% trying push anti-vax narrative. Im molecular biologist I've working vaccine manufacture since beginning pandemic certainly want discourage people taking vaccines. Something funny gone though.

There concerted hit job AZ vaccine media politicians. Macron's ""quasi ineffective"" quote 8% efficacy 'leaked' German health authorities, quietly retracted afterwards. subreddit posters who's entire post history disparaging AZ vaccine.

[It's politicians ever pushed specific pharmaceutical solution could easily bog standard vaccine nationalism, something feels way people discuss highly effective, easily manufactured stored vaccine that's sold cost worth taking. Society permanently change century ago result much deadlier Spanish Flu, account COVID?

People like simply using pandemic pretext revolutionary change, methinks. They're going sell them, that's ridiculous. vaccines expensive, they're like ¬£3-15 per dose. money entirely insignificant. fact, even recently finalised deal buy even more, including booster shots.

Also, UK already promised extra doses developing countries free. Anyone know latest hospitalization / death prevention rate Modern fully kicked in? 

I'm hard time finding accurate data since keep seeing 94%, understand infection rate. This!! I'm tired people saying big deal we'll fun later life thought high school / college sucked anyway. people college get education, ""fun."" Classes difficult online, research opportunities accepting new students, nearly impossible make connections help future. 

It's young people sad missed prom party. missing significant opportunities ""long term effects"" future. There's less people get virus going spread much I'm guessing one spread less lethal. Doggy style... prone bone... reverse cowgirl... glory hole... long term effects fucking grim happen well 10% infected. Sure covid probably kill 35 really want lose whole life chronic illness. That's true, supply would almost instantly opposed months long ramp up. wonder US government said needed new covid vaccine cover new strand, require full study like first approval. likened switching different flu strains flu vaccine every year. different this, would able pivot regular flu shots also able cover form? There's still studies done confirm people spread one another? Source lol Possibly so, experience politicians eager open cost. Pardon care bet great-grandchildren they're right. wife currently pregnant first hit 38 weeks. turning 34 April. would like 2 kids, natururally, pregnancy taken physical toll stage last thing wants think possibility pregnant older body. 0% Windsor Ont. keep hearing nursing homes etc got vaccinations. people keep complaining still even recieved first dose. I'm incredibly disappointed going. I'm also really tired shown differently local news, like together fine. many frontline people (and elderly) still getting rescheduled over, telling public everyone's got vaccines. read study, seen others like it. looking correlation orders put place trend cases/hospitalization/deaths follow? so, major problem studies behavior necessarily follow orders context 'fear' level rather relevant.

If many people already self-imposed lockdowns formal order, course see big impact. Likewise, people disregard order, see impact. Useful consider behavior influenced either context versus policy, necessarily evaluating subject policy itself. think would get best sense works looking things like location credit card data, see type behaviors actually led different outcomes. Two weeks........ Expecting people adjust behavior vaccinated ridiculous. understandable still need mask go shopping right now, perfectly reasonable take less precautions personal life. agree. 

As someone grew going Church, people celebrate Easter ‚Äúnormal times‚Äù don‚Äôt much church maybe lunch together, it‚Äôs regular day. one traveling Easter putting aside whole day celebrate it. Allegedly. There's still studies done determine that's actually case. remember mathematicians epidemiologists.

Tell Youyang Gu, whose models better epidemiologists Thank you. released earlier today aware initially posted. said, I'm curious see final numbers (after 2nd shot) considering amazing numbers got Israel day. 

Another issue might South African variant looks like AZ lacking protection. Anyone version behind paywall? 400k half Americans make entire lifetime. Purely statistically, .01% Americans would quality life virtually unaffected large sum money. assumed 400k well beyond people would find life changing. acting like baby?  4 unlucky number Japanese it‚Äôs pronounced death (shi). wonder chose compensation amount purpose. example explain math works. could used something completely different covid. Mate, happening levels.

I'd lying say I'm least slightly influenced either, feeling small moment pride among crap university near hometown managed produce vaccine probably one crucial fighting pandemic less developed countries. 

So question already dislike UK (i.e., hell lot Europeans due bullshit we've putting thanks brexit) might looking reasons disparage things go well us. could incorrect. That's I've read. You‚Äôre dying fam Would likely made huge difference. question whether stricter gathering rules etc. would minus 5 minutes counting That's why, institution least, completely ignore certain journals authors haha. realization comfort old nation's top priority hit pretty hard year. Also protests etc showed spike  tremendous improvement. sure US get everyone vaccinated August deadline remember correctly. huge accomplishment. visited the¬†Wuhan Institute Virology, impressive research facility, looks run well, due regard staff spoke scientists there. heard scientists‚Äô blood samples, routinely taken stored, tested signs infected. evidence antibodies coronavirus found. looked biosecurity audits. evidence.

Right, conclusion based hearsay never tested positive, never cultured RaTG13 speculation lab ""looks well run"" . supposed believe Chinese government would truthfully provide data? Trust cause, know, great record telling truth.  reasonably right choose treatment.

I disagree idk arguing with. almost like could spread people risk dying America people dying disease inconvenience fun. validity, I‚Äôm sticking current CDC guidance seems like outrageous lie. Source?  government provide make ones expect people use fully accessible. they‚Äôre that, see issue; they‚Äôre not, that‚Äôs idiotic.   Reasonable alternative. numbers make sense. 10 random sample COVID deaths, 3 late middle age one 30. 10% COVID deaths 30 years old require population except senior citizens suppose. Easter religious holiday many people *really* care about. Thanksgiving Christmas biggest family gatherings America, Easter isn‚Äôt even 10% that. one travels Easter. protein could change shape irreversibly lipids could separate liposome.

To pedantic here: protein structure really relevant. ""Blueprints"" protein encoded mRNA, RNA molecule that's unstable. Also, get top choice, give up! know number people transferred dream school first second year different school. Wow amazing! Thanks Joe Biden! Seriously legit feel way sometimes. Like, numbers continue trend down, vaccinations increasing, hell going start selling tickets concerts, sports games, etc. zero reason bands can‚Äôt going tour stadiums can‚Äôt filled. Go risk. Sorry it‚Äôs ridiculous now. Hospital aren‚Äôt overrun let‚Äôs go. Time move along. And? mean throw away civil liberties?

Whether I, 20 something, vaccinated, anyone's business I'm daily things like grocery store work.

International travel? Sure makes sense require it. Domestic activity? can't get behind that. least me. Maybe vaccine passports daily activity required people actually risk dying Covid. What's proposal better?  Luxxotica increasing price frames 50% typing this. know knocks transmission severity point.

Source. read lot promising indications, seen anything concrete. optimistic shown so, imho fortunate get vax, sure shit better continue minimum help protect rest people still waiting line. answer probably simply remains much uncertainty.

Yep, scientist want make predictions 10 months out. 

I suspect fear vaccine hesitancy combined low rates infection Spring/summer make lot people get vaccine. come next winter still big chunk population risk. wrong, lol. That's made comment reeling trauma all, let get caught news headlines hyper-aware exhausting. I'm afraid I'll give start feeding want it. Indeed, vaccination campaign outstanding example socialized medicine USA ever experienced!! Lol get - want everyone locked forever literally DECLINE cases fit narrative. What's likely, Serbia 2x better controlling COVID US, Malaysia 50x better, US better capturing data accurately? Here's link preprint/paper anyone cares read it: could simply adopt butt chugging instead California cases also dropping like rock weather beautiful right now. High 60s San Diego. Tons people about. Boris looks like he‚Äôs waited little bit long haircut. would surprised approval process would different. However, roll would faster expect many countries build strategic reserves materials needed make vaccine.

Ex. U.S. currently chicken stockpile chicken eggs used make influenza vaccine. pretty much time, ready max influenza vaccine production vaccinate country. Michael weighing whopping 500 pounds  clear looking graphs different states like South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, Washington, Utah California cases peak holidays. virus spreads schedule region.

Also note testing increases around holidays people prepare travel get back travel. testing means cases.

This myth every time people get together results surge cases that, myth. would bet money data would show this.

Still, dramatically better actually data (though noting published yet). one thing, politicians probably going reluctant modify life death policy decisions based suspicions, even strong ones. Yea, they're dumb ones, nevermind them. Nah raped massacred Chinese Like me. fucking CITY fabulously wealthy CITY that. Fuck assholes part. fair, pandemic mean Biden. Trump promised 20 million got tenth that. Permanently better ventilation systems people literally standing ass store seem like *bad* thing, though. ""schools, work places, restaurants, planes, gyms"" sound like telling hug grandma. jokes lost family friend miss high school.

What‚Äôs argument now? want 100% compliance everyone. easy. People talk herd immunity binary way like 70% nothing. 20% still significant impact RT value risk tolerance may higher yours. still death sentence young healthy people well 99% fine. said, implications indifferent getting Covid, like spreading it. He's never going promise. He's always going advise proceed caution. also seem business making bold predictions (in either direction) seems mostly stick facts. He's definitely blunders weird moments, overall think view Fauci's opinions good ""worst case"" baselin It‚Äôs funny watch people hate Fauci don‚Äôt agree assessment. based facts, experience, data.... Angry Reddit users‚Äô based caffeine, opinion ‚Äúumm actually neckbeard‚Äù *Of course* fault. 

Which indulgence pay *this* ""transgression""? Took 3 days get worst, 5 days really start feeling normal. see normal voluntary basis, especially sick immunocomprimised people. mask mandates stay. You‚Äôre right, medical regulators though. Politicians don‚Äôt say sort stuff unless something said medical regulator first. FDA ordered new trial medical regulators weren‚Äôt satisfied data - isn‚Äôt unreasonable tbf. French science/pharmaceutical industry shit could actually come working vaccine EU dependent AZ vaccine seem want anyway. experience employer cares details courses, look credential. show skills good enough one going object online courses year everyone thing. That's is. BTW c++ JS? Yes safe. less safe anything else.  We‚Äôve working hard get majority ‚Äúover 70yo relatives‚Äù vaccinated‚Äù 
and horrible time it. I‚Äôll pay attention articles everyone 65 us (who wants it) vaccinated.  whatever seem appreciate prolonged lockdowns necessary evil stop cases exponentially spreading infection rates got control healthcare systems overwhelmed happened last months, nobody wants go forever everyone fed up. 

What alternatives would suggest avoid exponential cases? would ‚Äúhealthiest solution‚Äù opinion? man said New York correctly. I'm within age group lower risk hospitalization begin concern me.
 
Further, believe strongly mRNA technology (and potential future impact response maladies) consider Pfizer's implementation superior others currently use. mean seasonal factors epidemiologists talk non stop twitter nobody else covers? Funny 3 hated world leaders Reddit (Trump, Boris Netenyahu) far best vaccine rollouts. also possible Christmas travel small impact too, although drop contained Christian majority countries. reply right person? So, message consistent, ‚Äúwe confident mask wearing dramatically reduce spread covid, why,‚Äù isn‚Äôt seen consistent (absolute). clearly explains circumstances would need exist local community level recommend cease mask wearing, seen inconsistent. 

It matter PR, honestly. dealing public, especially intense issue, never please everyone. since it‚Äôs Covid-19, work cut him, especially fiascos last year‚Äôs messaging. 

You hope repeat often enough best ways effort keep people safe. clue I‚Äôm saying eitherüòâüòâüëâüëâ trees ears haven‚Äôt really seen lot folks. see many people people build strawman. 

If twitter feed/social media overwhelmingly zero Covid folks, consider taking control you‚Äôre following. say hard do. Wear mask, gather large groups, washing hands? Shhhh actual data going screw variant scare tactics crisis given government opportunity control monitor citizens

This ""conspiracy theory"", statement easily observable reality. actually pretty striking people feel comfortable essentially saying ""it's conspiracy theory government increased control monitoring citizens pandemic, boy glad did"". countries form travel restrictions globe afflicted, so... so? really attacking AZ though? remember medical regulators saying enough data support giving vaccine over-65s US simply ordering new trial least US, majority nation severe winter weather served defacto quarantine many us (those us lose utilities it). correct messaging style infuriates wants get onboard. States headline means much biting poignant live life want, listening parents rather heart set back years. know what's best you. Europe, made Europe. sucks; graduated directly ahead 2008 crash know feeling. However I've started realize kind thing happens pretty often - seem major economic crisis every 10 years so. almost given many long-term life plans going end way expect disaster event come nowhere blow pieces. struggles really matter making life weathering disruptions eventually coming back; takes time happen long keep fighting want get to.

In short, makes sense angry this, remember insurmountable. enough time reach want, even things like trying throw track. Light bulb moment addition OP said, Sweden also counts covid deaths differently countries. Swedish death number would lower otherwise. haven‚Äôt eaten sit joint since began, mostly immune system shitty even flu kicks ass. 

After second shot, I‚Äôm going Texas Roadhouse I‚Äôm gonna put rolls beer body. 

Fuck miss beer tap. crazy, right? Lower Manhattan definitely took big 'ole hit people means left, Brooklyn neighborhood nothin really changed much. One brand new restaurant (opened January 2020) closed shop already replaced. Otherwise stuff hopping along pretty close normal. edit include vaccinated initial post. Assuming at-risk carry virus (nurse) vaccinated makes even OK. 

There's always going concern last talk, seeing social life fallen since warmer months, likely walk away trip happy took it. can't take back time family friends. Take necessary precautions go see family, especially year seeing them. Minimize obfuscate conflate come wearing masks, social distancing, gathering large groups, following basic health advice like washing hands sick stay away people. 

transferred this? hands around people sick easy

Do mean mask required gathering large group? obviously forgot asymptomatic spread. much spread had? wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs misinformation. AZ release data supporting theory I‚Äôm sure medical regulators would happy issue new statements. Atm don‚Äôt enough work Yep, blind spot logic reason I'll harass anyone see wearing mask couple months. implying non-binary gender-nonconforming Latin people? Also pretty hilarious say term ""forced Hispanics"" given Hispanic Latinx interchangeable terms. Florida here, Hey, less us amiright FDA meets week J&amp;J‚Äôs vaccine, let‚Äôs goooooo simply inaccurate. Doctors offices hospitals one thing DIDN‚ÄôT shut pandemic. 

People didn‚Äôt go without healthcare government shut things down. go without healthcare system either couldn‚Äôt provide healthcare safely didn‚Äôt resources provide all. It‚Äôs disingenuous blame deaths shutdowns. UK far stringent US terms lockdowns restrictions BoJo laying out, good sign us side pond also. It‚Äôs interesting read along articles US deaths incompetence. ~11 months ago able get follow serology test August 2020 (donated blood American Red Cross, came back negative). Donated twice since (November '20, Feb '21) negative.

Given body breaks antibodies relies T-cells B-Cells create new antibodies infection recurring short order, think 5 months sick second serology test would definitely led negative result. right, 100 countres gotten 0 vaccines, slow least part medical force almost 1 million elderly gotten vaccines today. need stronger international community stop hoarding, getting way vaccines lot countries even expect get soon. EU trying focus vaccines no? *medical regulators* said simply enough data say vaccine effective over-65s. case Pfizer others. AZ release data show efficacy over-65s I‚Äôm sure EU would happy issue new statement Deaths everything. vaccines go young people long time. diet like? Athletes don‚Äôt always eat well tend actually die sooner you‚Äôd expect. 

And get heart scan after? first dose pushed back week due supply interruptions. 

Anyone loves snow suck huge dong winter. Vaccination plus PPE work would pretty solid bet isn‚Äôt infected imho Like year ish ago us? God horrible. like grounded indefinite amount time way out, terrifying didn‚Äôt like lockdown one single bit. Right, I'm also saying American specific thing. Reports coming Germans Australians French wary Oxford refusing governments showed hesitation towards it.

America Americans blamed lot things Jesus christ. everything fault bloodthirsty America-first capitalists wanting everything non-American fail. That's ridiculous. PAWAAHH git da CHOPPA!!

....ill see  Hey man, I‚Äôm sorry hear that. hope you‚Äôre able rest process loss today. Much love coworkers.  might be... flip side, fatality rates higher certain parts Canada. Canada densely populated along US / Canadian border. Covid deaths significantly higher Ontario/Quebec southern parts. Thank you!! That's point along. We're really rolling (Doing great) Yet still know long term side effects vaccines. 2-3% world even one dose vaccine. 

It much likely combination level population immunity potentially seasonality. Amen !!!! Except virtue signallers use screech selfish everyone hunkered another year I‚Äôm hoping majority us ignore pandemic recent events made couple things clear me:

1. cult personality figure supposed ""good"", useless misleading ""bad"" guy. may make defend every word person utters, better productive discussions didn't.
2. Cults personality based negative feelings well, people devote (and waste) much time figure hate followers/worshippers person.  Yes. things extend life? Ahah countries spent last year making fun US expect US sacrifice vaccines 

This graph helps visual u/atealein saying. seen southern Sweden similar density rest Europe, northern 2/3 country 10 people lower per km¬≤.  wait long? Ensure every business destroyed? plan UK blame coronavirus economic collapse instead Brexit? Looool think countries making vaccines!?!? Ahahaha

Man need cut eating propaganda diet ! That‚Äôs misleading statement. Data one study compares vaccine doses meant given 3 weeks apart vaccine doses meant given 12 weeks apart. AZ case going marginally better margin error/ data collection size means difference essentially meaningless. 

However, could also compare efficacy overall (e.g. Pfizer‚Äôs efficacy Israel‚Äôs study) see Pfizer 95% effective AZ 60-80% effective preventing cases overall. Also Pfizer seems effective SA variant Oxford/AZ doesn‚Äôt. case it‚Äôs definitely worse.

The important thing right vaccines prevent hospitalisations deaths don‚Äôt think normal people rushing normalize masks done. masked Spanish flu generally shit turned okay, mostly likely story here. 

I see probably wearing one this, except come work like, cold something don‚Äôt wanna get office sick.

I think really another choice. trauma cases went zero hospitals curfew, lockdown alcohol ban. obviously helped hospitals deal covid. managed bring curve schools open giving chance opening now.

I think pandemic poor desision overall. Even staunch opposition parties many negative things say government dealing overall. professor global health policy London School Economics

""Top"" scientist? wonder thing every time see articles. know easily 30 people it. One early 80s died. One late 60s hospitalized fine. Everyone else version asymptomatic pretty rough flu. back normal within 3 weeks. Age ranges 7 woman 80s 30s thru 50s. mutate become less deadly contagious.

You know what's special? losing home. able feed family without worrying able next week. Times tough.

Slowly, long time, clear one right consensus accepts everyone agrees pretends never thought true moving next fight. 


It's basically this:  received doses per capita, also used greater percentage doses received every state except New Mexico, worthy praise.

You're still comparing apples apples. Receive 4 doses vaccine. Easy math, simply give grandparents risk. Receive 40% fewer doses suddenly consider grandparents risk. That's point 1987 article though. well established HIV transmitted kissing. yet Fauci double-downed ""don't kiss"" message.

For public health official that's safest course action maintain job. medical equivalent tech saying ""no one got fired choosing IBM""

This say science informing opinion, interest keeping job was. Nothing changed 30 years. travel England 2 months. Lets really see vaccines work. weren‚Äôt pretending it‚Äôs true! said could possibility.

Calm down, you‚Äôre one jumping conclusions.  Sweden restrict gatherings decrease movement? know anything recommendations gave all? agree. It‚Äôs sub obsessed word recently learned: *sterilizing immunity.* need sterilizing immunity stop spread, bullshit. trade war continued means.

But I‚Äôll good leave house things 
And pretty damn safely months time Spring: Probably okay. think people fully expect hanging backyards, garages, probably even indoors.

We kinds evidence much less effectively spreads outdoors, especially keeping 6+ ft distance. minute weather permits, I'm hanging friends outside much possible. Finally legitimate reason wear sunglasses indoors. time Fauci telling us wear masks 2022 grandparents still go see grandkids get vaccines... Sort of. like: William Farr demonstrated epidemics decline mathematically predictable rate, using empirical observations smallpox epidemic confirm this. later formulated several mathematical equations laws apply epidemics, e.g., prevalence disease calculated mathematical product incidence average  Belgium, UK, Italy, much higher obesity rate countries. approved FDA December last year. definitely anything numbers false positive tests plummeting recalibration PCR tests never intended testing infection first many vaccines distributed across country, low cases getting, I'm coming see every single lifted restriction good decision. West Virginia, role model everyone. Macron idiot fir saying said Canada lot fear B117 US does. probably think deeply. interesting see next move ""100 days masks"" ends. theorized, believe latest studies trending toward helping. understand frustrations, problem unvaccinated people. longer takes get entire planet vaccinated time virus mutate jump vaccines. sounds like may poor decision consider long term implications.  that‚Äôs articles exist get posted here, feel way. fact remains Trump opportunity invoke DPA manufacture PPE refused Obviously guy speaking global economic terms could certainly right. vast majority us living first world, the
 pandemic end year, assuming able stay ahead variants vaccination front.  Texas life basically back normal wear Masks everywhere. 

Indoor dining open, amusement parks open, stores, everything else April 2020 Well I've always thought people wear masks, freaking obvious, point time assessments actually correct his. already Pfizer-BioNTech Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines. US also donating billions purchase vaccines countries

I impression US boycotted Covax. rather make good doctor punching bag.

I'm sure Dr. Fauci want people blindly worshipping him, he's narcissist like Trump. Trump probably listened anyway. Wow. Lot anger there. data there. Several people linked already. end, like every pandemic history. 

And this‚Äîthis don‚Äôt get sympathy. brushed deaths 2.5 million people woefully uninformed conspiracies. We‚Äôre rapidly approaching number deaths equal 1,000 times deaths september 11th, 2001, you‚Äôre sitting bitching bored? No.

Plenty people dumb, plenty people lack ability feel others, you‚Äôre somehow both. Yeah I‚Äôm pro-vax. knew got asked. 
I guess difference standard vaccines around long know everything don‚Äôt know much COVID vaccine. 
That‚Äôs scientific consensus. don‚Äôt know much we‚Äôd like yet. it‚Äôs around couple months. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs dangerous. 
What I‚Äôve heard though vaccine that‚Äôs efficient enough could end making stronger virus. antibiotics end making stronger bacteria.  girlfriend experienced mild allergic reaction 30 minutes first Pfizer dose (after left clinic). Hot flashes, prickly skin sensation throat scratchiness. suffers many food environmental allergies, able recognize symptoms allergies.

Has anyone else experienced similar reactions? worried stronger allergic reaction second dose. Apparently ain‚Äôt one never heard thing called joke since two comments responded seriously. get shops put level gyms. former pretty save long people wear masks, keep distance, number customers one time limited relative surface area. example, Belgium non-essential shops open since 1 December significant increase attributed open winter. would reduce symptoms without reducing amount virus result transmissibility? Lol fuck ‚Äútop scientist‚Äù Another surge (at least terms deaths) borderline impossible given much elderly US already vaccinated. made 80% deaths. Yeah glasses eye care also crazy expensive. really shitty eyesight glasses cheap. Fuck lens needed special ordered way see it, spread outdoors possible, lot likely occur indoors especially masks prolonged exposure. Think way, someone protest game COVID, probably wearing mask, may infect ever right near them. house party 20 people, people probably infected. Yeah I'm sure number coming keep seeing. passed 500K time ago. Flu deaths likely Covid-19 public health measures sufficient suppress current flu outbreak; however, deaths due chronic diseases likely many people failed get adequate treatment since hospitals full Covid patients people reluctant seek treatment due fear infections. deaths also due pandemic, even directly caused coronavirus. know downvoted. discredit anyone's mental health this, affects younger generation.

I'm single dad mid 40's, two kids, work year kids schooling home. Eating away savings I've scrimping put aside last almost 30 years, since started working high school, could maybe retire comfortably one day. get job next year, I'll exhausted savings risk losing home, either way restart saving retirement scratch late 40's even get job. likely significant pay cut before. Funny Palestinian families who's sons held captivity Israeli regime get day court. stop vaccination 50% Israeli population. 

Not even **merely 2 days** part? specific California 58% deaths per capita Iowa?? brain even though reported cases Iowa go line deaths spike spike February? lie cases like deaths. guess summary laugh want numbers actually match statement all.

42% Less dead per capita Cali vs population density Iowa. Sickening republican policies work. Palestine.... That's critical fire pandemic response team. Every single one deaths, fault lies US government. can‚Äôt way write 2021? says summer people able gather friends, stop work form home, eat restaurants, travel domestically. Even fall/winter predict resurgence cases, say everybody wants vaccine one people end hospitalized anything catch it. reaching point mass vaccination fall large indoor gatherings like concerts happen again.

Even spring, they're super cautious saying go hang friend unless vaccinated, going determine level acceptable risk. I've already talked small group friends starting hang soon case counts positivity rates sink little lower. Since one couple vaccinated, wife one couple vaccinated, guy work home, would pretty low risk. especially, seeing dad (1C) get vaccinated hopefully long going open things lot me. lockdowns never end know. We're never getting freedoms back. 2.5 million really many compared seven billion? heard thing called joke? obviously serious comment Cases deaths per capita says otherwise. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly. live Tennessee downtown Chattanooga past weekend. best, maybe 20% people wearing masks. large swath population already done pandemic moving lives. We're reaching levels American exceptionalism never thought possible That‚Äôs reasonable justified.

There reason whatsoever vaccinated people dealing restrictions, especially months.

If want stick messaging solutions become available, pushback transition opposition social media message boards raining bricks molotovs angry mobs. Public masking fade vaccination rates go infection rates go down, simple. Politicians love using unquantifiable language like can‚Äôt held responsible anything. Yet year feels like sacrificing help old sick people received nothing return, thanks, appreciation, acknoledgment sarifice. many old people country currenty refusing get vaccinated driving insane.

Hey, forget blame cases rise always, without fail, laid upon us!  get depressed read headlines like this. Feels endless! type thing Biden‚Äôs predecessor ever UK signed contract AZ three months earlier incompetent EU, invested per capita production turn got priority vaccine.

The EU slow incompetent put price vaccines speed signing contracts cost lives. disgusting. 

They also relied heavily Sanofi producing working vaccine far failed do. Pathetic think country size France can't produce working vaccine. 

How many vaccines France produced let alone exported ü§£ ?! guess case counts missed memo cause fallen cliff. True, I'm sure thats Fauci's fault.

American politics make real lockdown near impossible Third best vaccine rollout world think people expecting variants able escape protection vaccine. That's always possibility, indications variant escaped yet.

Being overly negative confirmation there's truly dangerous variant seems like dooming time confirmed scientifically. think, maybe, see using existing drugs help manage long haul symptoms. agree. vast majority people ignored ""lockdowns"" second time around nothing accomplished except small businesses hurt. Yeah fairness agree. Pisses walk around crowded Asda can't go 4 nights fishing enough evidence efficacy older people effective older people, two completely different points. hate impossible find data dangers healthy teens young adults covid - parents grandparents vaccinated, still need care? us get vaccinations like half year year daring proposition still incorrect numbers vaccines. consider doses statement. Best case 21 million completely vaccinated end June

26 million* 21 million. That's Q3 contract. Canadas vaccination contract made quarterly agreement. Q1, Q2, Q3. Recently doses transported Q3 cant divide health.

You're making health released Statement variants need herd immunity 80-90% vaccin vs 60% initially thought. 

Source required verification.

The discussion variants. Currently variant infection extremely low. enough known enough known vaccines know efficacy rate is. talking ifs hypotheticals established population 16 higher 15%

Children considered low risk low transmission rates little symptoms. roughly 7.8 million Children Canada. Children low vaccination list. Allowing vaccines would meant diverted adult see huge improvement get variants control defeated then.

As stated before, current knowledge variants extremely low. infection numbers. Vaccines may may work them. 

My point stands. Trump authority fire Fauci, thankfully. done shutdown Fauci recommended one instead opted voluntary restrictions. really trust kids step sacrifice big long-term issue like climate change either they're kind people want go house parties middle pandemic care probably going hurt lot innocent people. mindset I'd expect likely end Boomers version 2.0. say want selfish pricks suffer going wrong people; many big name politicians, corporate leaders, bankers, etc. seen die even get seriously ill this?

Unfortunately, really going way make people power change priorities vote out. There's young people old people, need unified support able move numbers. Great. move south. Interesting- Google shut search based regular flu prediction project work?  BREAKING NEWS: 20 million March!!!! realised bit wordy thanks reading! Fingers crossed pay countries feel bit confident making decisions get sooner I'm sure everyone used Sweden anti-lockdown talking point last year along shortly amend statements. Fair point Well, idea. mother told me.

I checked website true; don‚Äôt give results. reason is, roughly translated, word word:

 ‚ÄúThe results meaningful individual state wellbeing donor, interval time several weeks donation availability results still unclear whether antibodies show protected infection.‚Äù

I kid not. statements evolved time. Trump failure governors failed USA still even considered real lockdown could quickly get COVID back control. theaters open don‚Äôt allow concessions. Unfortunately, article link study (ugh), I'm pretty sure it, based details separate samples hospitalized patients patients mild cases, rates long-term symptoms roughly (31.3% hospitalized vs 32.7% mild cases). biggest difference 43.8% hospitalized patients reduced quality life, compared 29.3% outpatients. think drawback study 16 people hospitalized, tough say significant differences (or lack thereof) are. 150 outpatients study, think fairly sizable sample kinds studies. studies I've seen seem pointing rates long-term symptoms anywhere 10-30% infections, definitely going problem many infections been. would better without evidence, would mean entirely made up. Instead point data huge confidence interval proclaim innocence. Hanlon's Razor strikes again. perfect amount slippery slime way lawsuit. hospitalized patient outpatients high proportion mild cohort individuals COVID-19 followed long 9 months illness, approximately 30% reported persistent symptoms. unique aspect cohort high proportion outpatients mild disease.

234 surveys sent out, 177 responded, 25% non-response rate. USA, things reopening slowly here....well check Walmart clear x amount small businesses destroyed. I‚Äôm 25 live Texas, able get vaccine? Thanks, makes sense. Apparently trust AZ vaccine work well elderly well prioritize fast easy roll-out. seems pay off. Entirely anecdotal, know twenty people first jab know jab they've - roughly 50/50 split.

None Pfizer ones side effects all. Two AZ ones felt bit rough following day (tired bit achy) nothing more.

If given free choice, I'd almost certainly go Pfizer. choice AZ today Pfizer couple weeks, I'd AZ one now. manipulation, profit motivated, bad reporting?

I never claim able distinguish them, saying probably occurring unfounded apprehension AZ vaccine regulator quoted article says nothing AZ‚Äôs safety/efficacy limited available data

The EMA regulate nations Germany, Austria, France Italy(?) held back using AZ over-65s. was, demonstrated article stated Oxford UK approval agency, based fact.

I point prominent example misinformation, though probably innumerable examples, considering nations made wrong decision. Considering adenovirus vaccines well understood technology, concrete reason doubt efficacy elderly. Well, least Anti-Vaxx crowd see results vaccines real time body ready üíâüí™üèª Dude fucking delusional? Holy shit. I‚Äôm literally citing Dr. Fauci‚Äôs fucking words. trust something?

But whatever cult wants think guess. highly doubt anywhere near true. Many European countries strong social support systems place reduce economic impact.

The USA usual believes live let die. That, plus severity pandemic USA, means economic damage US economy may greater Memorial day 2021 tipping point lot ""give shit"" evaporates, opinion. It'd get kids back faster schools safety teachers mind, can't see negative.

Oregon prioritized teachers better it, Inslee WA would rather pick pissing match fight teachers teachers unions force back prioritizing teachers.

It's benefit. Teachers get vaccinated leads kids going back school sooner better mental health mind. exactly right. baffles states basing anything aside age point. support co-morbidities ahead age data.

Teachers understand, tiny sliver pie uncorks huge amount economy (plus deal exclusively unvaccinated portion population). need another lockdown. think x-factor essential worker tiers. states counties lots tiers essential worker tiers mean general population served late spring early summer ‚Äî point half adults may already become eligible. contrast, jurisdiction says ‚Äúhealthcare, 65+, teachers etc, free all‚Äù looking much faster timeline fighting get appointments. It‚Äôs hard speak whole country different phases. is. also straightforward compared Finland Umm already open masks on. basically can‚Äôt go ballgame concert right now. Demand pushing bit truth absolutely cannot police mask wearing concert matter capacity. 
The list what‚Äôs actually closed pretty small. Enforcement impossible population big everyone knows it.  Deaths hospitalisations pretty much everything regards public health measures. Low deaths = need restrict people's lives consolation... great someone live pandemic, stuck 1br apartment someone else little outside definitely one worst things happen keeping sex life spicy. We've made pretty well considering circumstances, think sex improve lot people start life outside apartments/homes I'm sure mean people pessimistic, think people feel like end finally near, least rich countries. Old people getting vaccinated, cases mortality already going down, roll vaccines quickly enough going back up. 

There's anxiety effectiveness vaccines SA strain, really ""jury's out"" situation general panic. beaten it? People still get coivd. want get covid earliest probably get shot summer. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm trying hide anything. 

The planet comprised nation-states. responsible for, first foremost, well-being citizens. world functioned since humans created nation states borders. You‚Äôre going get different outcome, unless nation states longer exists sort global unitary government. That‚Äôs going exist anytime soon. explain Sweden even quarantine people coming countries. even start wearing masks January 2021. Interesting question I‚Äôm sure (doesn‚Äôt sound like article haven‚Äôt checked source). sample size enormous (entire population Scotland) effect size huge (85% 94%) would extremely surprising could explain away result factors. lot, essentially outdoor activity several indoor activities shops, gyms restaurants. Quarter full restaurants aren‚Äôt contributing much spread any. Los Angeles variant worse British one. Okay buddy, I'm done here.  ran business, would willingly tell certain percentage potential customers (the unvaccinated) want money? Especially similar business miles away gladly take customers? Follow money. Yeah that's hoping return in-person. Enjoy spit attitude! Take deep breath.

It's pretty clear everyone get jab June-July expected production goals hit.

There still bit uncertainty production targets, along uncertainty surrounding approvals J+J Novavax. Watch CDC Pfizer Moderna distribution numbers next weeks. start ramping significantly, indicating we're still track June/July. go back root question. virues super infectious put many small children true hell, when..it detectable like that. 
That make sense.

If test designed detect Coronavirus, coronavirus infectious contamination able change test results.

I mean that's basic logic, science..
That's science works.
That's I've learned school. think Fauci free make unabridged recommendations public, wrong. Heck, surprised able make full recommendations West Wing without fear losing job. operate within political environment largely agree him. said could, could, attempts nudge us right direction. scenario ‚Äúmany times Huh, interesting! Im US donated blood use app shows details donation including antibodies/no antibodies. reason Belgium disclose that? lose first days pay you? Well, interesting alternative reality live in... field epidemiology seems weird one get care fame. I'd say claim lacks reason evidence. UK delaying second dose 12 weeks enough people would 2 doses. Gotta wait abit longer results Uk Well, it‚Äôs pretty simple: It‚Äôll get extended another 100 days. Rinse repeat US reaches herd immunity.

This sounds like it‚Äôs bad thing, it‚Äôs really not. lmao sub cringe. could reasons concern sure would rely Newsweek report accurately, they‚Äôve decline years full-on clickbait trash. sudden I‚Äôm reminded Chicken Little. Debate good. supplied rationale predictions. voices better. important get hung one voice. That's examine excess mortality instead raw numbers. March March mom still gotten hers. applied almost every city within 45 minutes her. appointment week, shipment got delayed something pushed back month again. I'm sure facetious reading blurbs carefully enough. responsible you. climate crisis know? know right. I'm starting think vaccine may actually work. would crazy realize 10% mortality rate much, much 30% increase, right? 70, Covid mortality rate usually listed around .2% less. we'll use .2%, 30% increase would mean moves .26%. That's enough world go back normal. assume consession sales allowed, yes?

So likely ""while eating"" loophole. new type cancer first struck March include stats March suspect single homes thing massive - best form social distancing type happens without people even realising it. Particularly case covid appears via close contacts. Annnnd You‚Äôre one them! Surprise!

Projected deaths supposed 130,000 last summer whole pandemic. 

500k+ you‚Äôre saying everything overblown. 

Insane. 

Go back read article. It‚Äôs clear didn‚Äôt read statement. keep wearing mask bit longer, it‚Äôs much ask kill fewer people. Lol yeah suppose movie theater exception. Again, ‚Äúspeculation‚Äù media misinformation motivated profit particularly harms AZ non-profit vaccine. things need true case:

1. media reporting misinformation. 
2. misinformation widespread knowingly false. 
3. Misinformation around non-profit vaccine must higher misinformation around for-profit vaccines. 
4. Regulators need acting misinformation way harms non-profit company helps for-profit company. 

So far, point one seems satisfied. 

We evidence German newspaper knowingly publishing false information media entities refused take bait. Meanwhile misinformation Pfizer Moderna‚Äôs efficacy stopping infection rampant ever. Deliberate manipulation, profit motivated, bad reporting?

That regulators yet approve AZ 65+ countries *not* proof regulators engaging swayed misinformation. data presented article shared accurate, data probably sufficiently limited risk-adverse regulators decide need more. pretty wide confidence intervals. 

As know, that‚Äôs common limited AZ. USA generally approved Pfizer Moderna populations trial data limited insufficient claim safety efficacy. Isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs supposed work? Even regulator quoted article says nothing AZ‚Äôs safety/efficacy limited available data. 

All article proves German newspaper screwed reporting. didn‚Äôt stop EMA recommending AZ ages within days said bad reporting. sufficient evidence speculate profit motivated misinformation, let alone claim happened others have? get difficult. Airlines figured out, schedule people. Unlike airlines however, tell they're alternate spot vaccine guaranteed. trick putting vaccine Nuka-Cola. Hawaii done good job virus. natural advantage island. I'd imagine August risk low. less normal Norway Denmark .... Stop lol. inform us, issues continuously laments misinformation pandemic fatigue. goals include informing us, obviously, medical face US response also wants country healthy possible. role ADVISING offering opinions addition informing. 

Fauci wants flout information, advice educated opinions buy messaging improve public's health. Great news. US well way done pandemic end April. sure? move needle...

(Into arms) suicides/depression I've found opposite; Zoom long, coming back campus working person coworkers smalltalk skyrocketed since pretty much talk anything work Zoom Teams lot catch on, especially stuff like TV shows we've watched past year. Wow, interesting read. assume, Norway, Sweden, Denmark Netherlands took surplus. would incredibly foolish this. says Covid 19 one time article mean belongs here. coronavirus sub. article definitely not. please share source AZ Efficacy greater Pfizer? Also, side-effects issue real issue. might minor issue grand scheme things issue nonetheless. care much masks, nuisance what.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  remainers absolute disbelief EU acted AZ vaccine actually.  Here‚Äôs one four days ago bunch data back up. Basically every case know 4-5 cases. That's 112-140 million people may exposed 34-42% population. numerous studies around throughout pandemic including numbers put CDC.

Plus evidence people simply naturally immune. theory India, think people certain genes gives immunity. identified US also possible. know people seem unaffected virus whatever reason.

Or consider graphs would look like virus suddenly unable spread widespread immunity. think would look exactly like look now. Indonesian government money buy pfizer, need quick vaccination medical workers late. number cases also growth every days. know china country luxury pick expensive vaccine large number. Currently indonesian government negotiations vaccine providers considering options increase vaccine distribution. 

Do problem Sinovac? Iq logic neanderthal checks It‚Äôs basically true, that‚Äôs bothers people talk horrible racism West totally glossing Eastern countries organized kind insane racism goes Japan China. reported EU? I‚Äôve look French German sites can‚Äôt see anything, admittedly quick glance. It‚Äôs probably relevant post-pandemic life expectancy post-Pandemic population include 500k people died (of many likely really bad shape pre-pandemic). 

Survivorship bias, basically. Hospitalisation efficacy numbers trials always going unreliable thousand tens thousands people, there's going handful hospitalizations even control group. 

Extrapolating reported symptomatic efficacy two doses - BnT/Pfizer reported 95%, Oxford/AZ reported 62% (rising 82% 12-week gap doses); assume BnT/Pfizer would better hospitalisation efficacy one dose. know people coupled up. met then, instead reasonable dating process (yes, that's awkward wording idc), people maybe acquaintances immediately decide move together hint crush, everything gets accelerated. Lockdowns never work. don‚Äôt care military shooting people streets, people disobey. Young people won‚Äôt care. Older people won‚Äôt care. Travelers come in, legally illegally. virus remain.

Any strategy requires 100 percent compliance, like lockdowns, pointless comparable strategy all. It‚Äôs worse, actually, attempting hopeless lockdown lead secondary tertiary effects like economic damage mental health issues. still people getting infected summer. He's President France. Regardless (lack) medical knowledge, words weight people listen him. world leader dismiss vaccine ""quasi-ineffective"" global pandemic, without actual evidence back up, incredibly reckless. Doubly entire continent struggling vaccine supplies. section, first give insight number vaccines Netherlands already purchased various contracts. know, Netherlands buys vaccines jointly, basis contracts concluded EU level (Advanced Purchase Agreements: APA). basic principle purchased volumes principle distributed among member states basis pro-rata distribution population. pro-rata share Netherlands 3.89%. sometimes countries part European Space Agency (ESA) also participate contracts, share sometimes also slightly smaller. However, Member States always want take pro-rata share. cases, surplus allocated countries opt ‚Äã‚Äãfor this. Member States obliged decrease share distribution allocated them, positive marketing authorization decision vaccine far, EU Member States concluded agreements six manufacturers (BioNTech / Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, CureVac, Janssen Sanofi). agreements (except Sanofi) already subject binding allocations among Member States. Negotiations agreements Novavax, Valneva, three vaccine developers still addition basic part, contracts also optional part, invoked later. regard BioNTech / Pfizer Moderna, optional parts contract already invoked (see column ""options"" table 1). contracts, optional parts yet available. addition, may also top-up contracts, case demand vaccine exceeds available quantities basic contract / options. top-up contract almost complete BioNTech / Pfizer negotiation Moderna (see Netherlands always opts pro-rata share almost cases also share surplus. surplus BioNTech / Pfizer option contract, Netherlands opted surplus. However, offset taking share top-up contract BioNTech / Pfizer (both pro rata surplus). see table below, Netherlands purchased almost 6.5 million extra vaccines (surplus), Member States want valid logical reason can't blame them?

Did even read said? sentence contradicts ffs. SVT wrote interesting bit comparisons:

*""During recent major outbreaks disease - Asian (1957), Hong Kong flu (1968) severe flu 1976 - Sweden, together Denmark, mostly hit harder Norway, Iceland Finland. Nobody able fully explain due to.""* (Google Translate)  Strange. It‚Äôd interesting know is, wasn‚Äôt deficit months example Norway. Neither. End measures now. Easy. Israel use info health care providers notice lately new morbid cases ppl didn‚Äôt take vaccine. It‚Äôs like two ir three months now.

Word system reason pharma companies decided give Israel full supply early That's gamble get drunk time, lol. Fuck work-shit, life's over, might well. Interesting, know detailed analysis before. I'm depth layman there, read lines bit, told influence stabilization strain efficacy speculation. isn‚Äôt surplus. gross inequity distribution. literally evidence today shows AZ Efficacy greater Pfizer. Pfizer figures questioned excluded Asymptomatic several 1000 suspected cases figures. AZ breached contract, contracts released people near 100% agreement AZ breach contract.

I give delayed deliveries, happened. still expect brand new vaccine brand new production processes. Call local go. I'm sure they'll register phone anxious going in. Thats one apartment building. Yeah live Alabama. think huge difference South places like California NY. go pickup food restaurants see 30 50 people inside masks eating. Despite cases like 80 percent last two months. personally eat inside many people quite yet, I'm weeks away vaccine ill right along side soon. Gives great hope back normal 2 months. pfizer administered 80+ population percentage. Maybe that's issue.

But anyways shows good vaccines. Herd immunity much easier achieve One partial factor calculated SCB statistics is: massive mortality deficit January mid-March (1800 fewer deaths compared 2015-19, number back head, furthermore deficit summer months). CA shortage too. visit r/politics celebrating vaccines Canada. Canada üá®üá¶ lost 30k citizens 500k Exactly. people sub help sensationalize words use brains read actually said beyond headline‚Äôs framing.  green line 7 day average. Biden‚Äôs claim 100 million shots, full vaccinations. 

From NYT article Mr. Biden repeatedly promised get 100 million shots Americans' arms 100th day office. Spare thought us who've holding bag Doom Paul memes since 2008, still mooned... üò∞ I'm 51 brutal reaction AZ vaccine last week (only lasted days though). immune system generally pretty weak doubt that. Covid last April though hit hard maybe related that. true. like said, stringent measures lasted month two. comparison basically everywhere else, life essentially normal besides masks limited restaurants capacity. data new hospitalizations Israel? think lockdown would necessary UK fuck like don‚Äôt care putting us endless loop lockdowns. put us one big lockdown end lockdowns 6 months year really couldn‚Äôt care less whole fucking drives wall. put us lockdown stupidly open everything virus spreads like crazy back lock rinse repeat.  Idk, doubt thousands people die covid Norway pandemic ends. Same. mental health really bad this. I'm well aware finding partner going happen point. am, people marry young AF. 25 pretty much oldest really meet someone unless going wait everyone divorces 30s want someone older divorced. 

This overly religious area either. Mostly cultural Christians. family pretty Jesus, due age time (23) considered fine date Jewish guy would old date anyone circles. I'm going 26 November. I've aged out, painfully clear. UK stats low weekends. work around use 7-day averages. compare month ago 

A month ago 7 day average decreasing faster now. vaccine reducing hospitalisations, rate would increasing, !   executing today? love foreigners living Japan. Seriously one best places go live 20s years.

They want foreigners living Japan forever.

So true want you, dont want forever. happen suddenly. People started realize suddenly. building months. Wait 4 weeks. Cases plummeting rate 18-28% per week average. bit conservative settling 20% per week, take 4 weeks US cases crash second wave floor first wave peak. 5-6 weeks we‚Äôre looking lowest case numbers since first wave peak, unless theres‚Äôs kind dramatic shift way things playing out.

You remember testing capacity dogshit summer. didn‚Äôt really reach full capacity mid fall. Back first wave, true case load likely 10-13 times confirmed positive cases. new cases probably 3-7 times confirmed positive cases testing anyone cough pulse shows drs office, mention event- sports- travel-related testing.

Breaking measured levels first wave‚Äôs April peak/May floor would mean true case load 2-4 times less actually measured numbers. knew someone going repeat exactly trying sarcastic about. OK.

Yes, fair compare Sweden poorer country continent. I'd say developed EU economies (and industrialized western countries) pretty similar here. 

The people die disease heavily skewed particular groups (e.g. people assisted living facilities) probably useless start grouping countries e.g. weather healthcare budgets, rather looking specifically circumstances 80+ group (how many there? elderly care organized e.g. huge facilities, smaller facilities, what's ratio facility home care oldest group etc). suspect found data anything else. read full, actual statement think less saying that, future, people may choose wear masks help combat COVID respiratory illnesses, completely voluntary. Please read beyond headline. Errrrr.... true. 

AZ fighting EU regarding contract deliveries. efficacy AZ lower BioNTech way side effects AZ BioNTech. true statements. 

So yeah, issue isn‚Äôt whether true instead serious problems actually general public. shouldn‚Äôt ever restrictions. People aren‚Äôt stupid government thinks people perfectly capable assessing risk acting accordingly. young adults. Everyone. know said that, never official position French health authorities. He's idiot. Fortunately literally billions people world benefit AZ million refuse it. Sad likely people literally die PR nothingburger. Essentially number people dying long term, Sweden front loaded. countries simply started catch up.

Remember original plan lockdowns ""flatten curve"", ""prevent deaths"". spreading number illnesses fatalities longer period time. Sweden chose higher spike cases first went lower cases. Reversion mean. great news! correct means protect vulnerable reach herd immunity time all. He‚Äôs Gollum headed granny shagger Astrazeneca shot foot multiple issues trials lackluster results. followed political shitshow. Can't blame media. hurdles, fear misinformation threatening leave city‚Äôs immigrant communities behind vaccine rollout ramps up. article Sep 2020, long second wave thrashing, among others, Germany - despite lockdowns/store closures/school closure ...

This superbowl, world cup - zero sum game. need vaccines. lot vaccines. many damned vaccines need soon possible.  


People seizing tidbits 80 vs 90 vs 95% efficacy efficacy sera words numbers meant nothing last 30-60-90 days... take long time people die Covid, people dying today infected weeks months ago. also reporting lags. what's hypothesis current downturn cases starting plummet quickly. isn‚Äôt vaccines (yet). may starting see combination seasonality side likely seeing herd effects kick in. Correct. ""The company's plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate Phase 2 clinical trials. things go according plan, 80 million doses end year, produced facilities Canada U.S."" 

You're referring Medicago. vaccine indeed developed Canada, manufactured states. Well truth know, still know. various theories spread really conclusive evidence. masks best thing easy way people comply go with. Compulsory licensing already allowed WTO rules. India South Africa always hated IP system using COVID opportunity undermine it. 

They don‚Äôt need waive TRIPS agreement respond crisis, want political reasons. said awhile ago, hurricane keeps talking supposed three weeks now. wrote could check back later. It‚Äôs supposed happen March 14-end April predictions correct (I don‚Äôt see logically be). actually read letter Hugo de Jonge wrote parliament Netherlands took surplus could. Wait second, looking letter. Yes, look obvious responding question gives option take centre stage nail coffin. interested data? Ok. entire world system needs examined pretty hard follow line Palestine distinct country. Thats like apartheid South Africa Bantustans ""distinct countries"". Meant South African apartheid government could claim responsible. 

From health perspective would bizarre treat Israel Palestine one entity. It‚Äôs religion, it‚Äôs radicalization fringe groups. It‚Äôs patriotism, it‚Äôs nationalism. It‚Äôs lack scientific knowledge, it‚Äôs denial facts suppression experts. Isn‚Äôt them? Really?  Something something covering eyes glasses infringement freedom. Maybe helicopter parents.

Border workers first here. assuming everyone young careless? careless would complaining we‚Äôd partying friends wouldn‚Äôt we. Funny government health authority everything Sweden always saying get herd immunity, international media keeps whining ""do-nothing approach"" herd immunity strategy... Ridiculous Nope. Nobody gave fuck beyond suggesting stupid bullshit like therapy vapid platitudes, real point even bringing up.

All ""wahhh I'm depressed life's perfect right now"" people 20s beyond pathetic.

Do civic duty shut up. Palestinians aren‚Äôt Israeli citizens. Israeli Arabs getting vaccinated like Israeli citizen. This... true, least EU.

EU insisted paying less UK refused commit buying stocks approved. meant pharma companies unwilling manufacture enormous stocks chance got turned down.

The UK committed buying even approved it. paid per unit. also approved way earlier. 

It's wonder UK got stocks EU. UK (where AZ manufactured) put export controls vaccine (EU threatened side, end - AZ initially made solely Belgium iirc).

UK's rollout much better, too, that's separate issue. Hard vaccinate one give vaccines Someone already gave formula, I‚Äôll put words (for see equations brain shut panic):

If you‚Äôd normally infect 4 people, 3 immune, you‚Äôll infect one person.  3/4 vaccinated/immune (over 75%) means person infects average less one person, cases start decrease.

If you‚Äôd normally infect 3 people, 2/3rds protected 

So, question many people case normally infect.  equality races genders. Way much ask. I‚Äôve given shaking hands good.

Your assertion life ends 30 sounds like shit well. 40 min drive long?

They're likely making money vaccine sold. Why? matter one zip code vaccines another long distributed equitably? Death cancelled, y'all! Well fucking said. weary news stations cherry picking says using headlines cause controversy.

I knew media mostly either blatantly lying twisting facts viewership *before* COVID, damn last year even wake-up call. idiotic take. RECORD cold spell 2/3 USA. worry, incarnated alternate world long peer reviewed studies. good enough believe vaccines stop spread, good enough people charge like Dr. Fauci start talking this. No, reason high death rate extraordinarily high incidence care homes 80+ age reported various districts throughout Germany, currently **particularly nursing long-term care homes**, occupational settings, households. Additionally, many districts, increasingly diffuse spread SARS-CoV-2 without traceable transmission chains.  **patients older age groups often suffer severe illness** due COVID-19, number serious cases deaths remains high level. avoided persons prevent spread SARS-CoV-2 virus help infection control measures. 

Mid-January example incidence 80+ age group 299, total population last Tuesday, 65'403 deaths, 2'174 (3.3%) occured 0-59 age group.

[RKI report page complicated part places waited situation get bad locked down. places lock ones (though luck good planning) overwhelming number cases. hard make comparison without accounting bad situation start.

It's also interesting countries proactive lockdown requiring high numbers cases (i.e. China, NZ) seem faired pretty well. america surpasses canada yet again, take canada /s LatinX? Seriously? scientific study actually using language? drop infections due people finally taking precautions? Exactly healthcare system would want. people follow guidelines, maybe problem guidelines, people. Public policy takes place real world, fantasy world 100% compliance. Scotland vaccines rolled 80+ age range first. local surgery awaiting new delivery vaccines. hospital admission old people becuase otherwise stat makes sense? UK's medicine regulatory body considered amongst best best world, would approved vaccine doubt safety whether effective. helps put band-aid small piece medical tape (paper cloth) along top edge mask nose. People refuse AZ vaccine shouldn‚Äôt get BioNTech one either move right end queue. global health crisis absolutely time picky. weird question: 
If someone fully vaccinated donates blood. immunities go along blood donation? reasonable causal mechanisms (less touching face due used something it, mask seal) even actual results convincing ones paper really stretch. Biden said wear masks ~~for 100 days~~ 2022.

That's took beat COVID! scares many people developing heart problems getting Covid. exactly. makes crazy when, using phrases like ""LISTEN SCIENCE"", hand experts virology (a technical topic indeed best handled experts) also policy goals (a topic requires input citizens democracy).

Interesting. provide source this? want tell do. think would fine take many precautions possible. hospital single confirmed case anyone fully vaccinated. still wear masks pretty much every where. already wearing masks break room eat, crazy sitting corner facing walls. actually sit facing adequate social distancing chat lunch. Hold up, it‚Äôs like everyone Germany/France refusing AZ vaccine. People 80 years didn‚Äôt even get chance yet. second financial disaster us millenials.A lot us dug last one. Literally first Google Janssen Vaccine Candidate Access Distribution
The Company committed bringing affordable COVID-19 vaccine not-for-profit basis emergency pandemic use, pending regulatory authorizations. Congrats!! Canada lockdown mid 2022?

That's me, Dawg. keep goal posts moving...we must permanent lockdowns course, keep us ""safe"" Every time see picture think dope guy correct changes behavior happening NPIs put place? Early measures likely happened time lot people making significant changes behavior necessarily govt mandates. want better data is: UK today data shows AZ vaccine effective preventing hospitalizations Pfizer one. Ah, see Nah, you‚Äôre misreading it. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs problem either system (US Japan). think it‚Äôs hypocritical US gets labeled super racist supposedly allowing people country. know far less mRNA companies, unlike Oxford, nearly forthcoming data. Even so, they‚Äôve said it‚Äôs likely less effective lack real world data like Oxford though. got COVID second time new UK strain antibodies mean fuck far concerned. big deal obviously, got bit fever time, get infected. people going continue fear virus like plague tho. freezing upper midwest since November, please try again. one vaccine entire life? worry, even us French know what's going anymore... 1. Flu death estimates, real test confirmed number far lower. ""In last six flu seasons, CDC‚Äôs reported number actual confirmed flu deaths‚Äîthat is, counting flu deaths way currently counting deaths coronavirus‚Äîhas ranged 3,448 15,620, far lower numbers commonly repeated public officials even public health experts.""

2. deaths occur within days positive death reported Covid death, cause death later determined Covid one direct causes, death reversed, ie removed total. Also curious people started staying home voluntary basis order in-place. 100% headline makes 0% sense Lockdowns substitute vaccines. Good. Let's squash disease regain sense normalcy like Israel has. I'm sorry actively ***go out*** freezing temps? According international law, PA responsible vaccinations. even affirmed Israel asked wanted Israel purchase declined said buying Russia. Russian vaccines delivered month Palestine. Lmfao, wut?! Bruh, average yearly income area 20k. 400k, I‚Äôd living comfortably fuck 15 years. Exactly. Things quite obviously improving, good reason continued optimism. leaders setting standards restrictions go away, get points ‚Äúfollow science‚Äù one would mean could small indoor social gatherings people vaccinated. I‚Äôm vaccinated hung inside vaccinated friend yesterday. First time almost year; great. ""Where may significant difference markets drug company prioritizing. Soriot confirmed La Repubblica company¬†had agreed supply UK markets,¬†saying ""fair enough"" UK reached agreement AstraZeneca earlier EU. UK's official contract actually dated August 28, one day EU's Wait... monkey boris going give us one two doses he? Calling now. We've 0 cases hospital fully vaccinated staff. already mask free break room gotta eat. feel like sit corners room anymore eat lunch.

Yes, still chance spread. little risk getting severe case even symptomatic case, much less concerned. Still things supposed to, less OCD things like conversations nursing station eating lunch withing 10 feet other. US (300 Million population) Canada (30 Miliion pop) FUCKING SHIT fact best examples cherry-pick actually supports point strong correlation, FYI. know what? Someone like nothing ever good enough for, even worth time lmfao. ‚úåÔ∏è Sounds like win-win Thats wonderful, one less thing weigh down. live military town, can't even go nearest big city. They're required stay county. honestly think happened 80s, lockdown. Large events might cancelled, sure. travel bans stay home orders? Working home possible internet. Grocery delivery online shopping exist. People _had_ go out. Seethe Ya suicidal people deal with, babies.

This sound like btw. Nah sub went ""NZ celebrates 420 days without covid"" (lockdown way) ""America #1 vaccines"" (lockdown longer way) really fast. isn‚Äôt hardest thing deal doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else experience. Incredibly ignorant tell people get grip mental health *global pandemic* ready abstracts nicotine molecule binds ACE2 receptors, blocking coronavirus. think studies needed it‚Äôs determined theory correct yet. also population less cali way lower testing rates.... entire TWiV team assembles discuss resurgence COVID-19 Manaus, Brazil, discovery SARS-CoV-2 related viruses bats Southeast Asia, increased Ct values administration mRNA vaccine. look comparably dense cities Florida Texas lower rates cities Jersey, California, etc. 

Those places show effective early border closures, extensive contact tracing, testing, mandatory quarantines are. none things, restricting public things like curfews, business closures, gathering guidelines etc, shown little efficacy. contacts fell can't find glasses try find contacts fell replacement boxes. fucked still get covid. can't see either way find out. Yes everyone suffering, young adults far impacted this, starting careers, going college, age groups careers already made themselves. think highly overestimate number people actually isolated whole year. even overestimation, bet people really locked going change getting vaccine. Fauci corrected reporter days ago asked question ‚Äúmasks years‚Äù mantra. corrected reporter saying ‚Äúmonths.‚Äù Trump made possible lmao Very. I‚Äôm sorry, repeat that? PTSD offers promise improvement resolution. People died COVID unwillingness mask/socially distance don‚Äôt option It‚Äôs absolutely normal. humans adjust, quickly. faith go back normal point, though better hygiene normalising wearing masks flu season would awesome changes keep. 

I 2.5 year old almost nowhere since last March. going swimming, daycare, gymnastics, museums, grandparents house. hasn‚Äôt seen anyone immediate family members person without mask entire living memory. adapted. adapt back. 

It‚Äôs rough. end. Appears valid finding me. population, case Coronavirus victims, analyzed determine average remaining lifespan. 
USA 25% worse per capita. thought comment pretty funny. doubt serious vaccinated people risk age health (not including first responders, others got it). 

Maybe change ‚Äúregular‚Äù, careful people get vaccinated. 

But hear you. It‚Äôs really frustrating. don‚Äôt think pandemic one day won‚Äôt get vaccine good while. choices quietly die try live now. Probably lot USA yes. Maybe push little masks try encourage people vaccinated. 

Canada shut cruise ships waters next year. (completely ridiculous go far even right risk) know rest world. Dude. guys population less cali, highest testing rates world. Imagine actually friends first year college, imagine actually high school graduation, cause millions students missed those, people like probably went person college 4 years great time. country fucked Canada withholding vaccine samples clinical trials Canada helped develop political row? magnanimous! countries even one dose. world needs many good vacinnes asap. benefit wealthy nations help others unless want crud circulating globe coming back meaner ever. death toll keeps growing higher deluded rightoids keep screaming move on. 

Meanwhile civilized countries re-opening close zero deaths. honestly boring. 

They right, death tragedy, million statistic. mean New York California home largest/densest cities states. 

I don‚Äôt know kind gotcha. need look places like South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Australia show effective restrictions be. Compliance restrictions important reducing restrictions. many people believe god given right spread infected respiratory droplets others. deaths per 100K

EU 118

USA 148

The USA 25% worse EU. yet people ones getting vaccines first get stay home day younger generation work. someone's lifetime PTSD, many people day? get many orbits around sun number too. Thank you! Australia needs talk scientists make policy decisions based evidence. you‚Äôve reached herd immunity, restrictions reduced. adventurous generous way putting haha Got second Pfyzer shot today, I‚Äôll keep wearing mask public health officials say it‚Äôs ok stop. science, politics individual opinion. Instead wrangling percentages sketchy data, remember there‚Äôs conclusive proof wearing masks reduces transmission. Reducing transmission defeats disease, however it‚Äôs done. would ""eye storm""? THC/CBD users less affected due specific binidings up/down regulation ace2 receptors fully tested yet. Also asthmatic people less/more susceptible seeing used coughing phelmb expelling things lungs well used restrictive air flow. 

A ton shit fully understood new variant common cold. life long asthmatic worried outset last march doc basicaly told me, 1'I young asthma controlled get note excusing work"". Meaning got go back frontline grocery employee serves 500 customers day, SLOW DAY. see people doc exposed 6 months, single day. Let's forget company doesn't, never enforce mask policy customers. SOO know, WHATEVS right! 300 million people Ah, Dr Doom Gloom Tons I'll bet, many documented cases oppressive masks? gonna say, Atlanta feel like 500k city  ‚ÄúEquity important‚Äù 

Needles arms important. enemy good perfect. Individuals don‚Äôt need pay anything. government pays Pfizer $20 per dose. would glad see us pay $40 $100 $500 would increase production decent amount. Would money much better spent trillions spending stimulus. 

I also sure unemployed waitress would rather get vaccine able start working rather get $1400 check. 

Many lives could saved could resume normal life sooner gave unlimited resources towards vaccine production. bad optics let people die. UK far ahead US immunizing age group. know many people lives destroyed lockdowns, neither anyone know even knows anyone mild case. I've working person whole time, supposedly one hardest hit states. Far ""just everyone know personally critically affected,"" unless mean affected lockdowns. death rate / million remain similar US

Wrong.

30% lower.

It's significant. meanwhile grocery store worker waiting Huh? COVID raging pretty much every single state. Seems appropriate close investigation. Yeah going enforce lol. Also even going work vaccine even approved yet currently available emergency use approval? relevant also relevant person managing COVID data resigned protest DeSantis‚Äôs unethical practices perhaps, required? really much risk under-30 crowd encephalitis vaccine required?

Huh, know mRNA vaccines used bird flu before. Quite articles I've seen seemed act like mRNA vaccines new thing never done before. I've even heard changes DNA somehow considering likely affects RNA going name different DNA, doubt sure there's basis it. get people judge vaccinations way successfully combating covid 19. prevention cure. country still huge number dumbass still believe covid 19 hoax, dont follow social distancing protocol dont wear mask public, means country still failed curbing covid 19. thing want keep stable surrounding medium, active part vaccine, made water. Minimally more, technically costs added COVID fees. refunds yet room board even, luckily commuting. Yeah, could definitely contributing factor. surprise Florida reporting cases. suppose question would much they're it, question whether they're really it, real number would expected difference. suppose I'd see number. Got hard adolescents teenagers many losing parents, aunts uncles, grandparents‚Äî Coronavirus. haven‚Äôt heard that. vaccinations don‚Äôt see sense though. 

But wouldn‚Äôt worry much that. Governments give timelines want resumption normal life, others said, people decide social distancing, etc ends normality resumes. know nobody gives pigeons taint social distancing anymore.  masks WA anymore, really noticed capacity limits either Australia immunity. Given choice high immunity zero cases I'd take high immunity - outbreak would still controlled kill many people, zero cases relies everybody everything perfectly. right, probably word they'd use. Covidshield They‚Äôre stonks kinda suck lately tbh. Shits sideways forever. Moderna though. Made like 10k 

Wish got BioNTech early vaccine process. Pfizer accident went nowhere lol native manufacturing capabilities Canada

Yeah, that's failure part, let's least change going forward. many policies assumed US would take account Canadian interests, since economies integrated. area going forward clearly need self-sufficiency. can‚Äôt begin imagine, thank you‚Äîand doctors, nurses, medical personnel. isn‚Äôt really signed for, we‚Äôre grateful you. Please hang there. Let us know give strength. fuck military personal first priority us care home residents front line medical staff??? truly blows mind See find frustrating. Lockdown obsessed countries, Canada , Australia, want completely flatten society seem real hurry lift country .. that‚Äôs huge red flag . 

I know that‚Äôs preferred narrative Reddit I‚Äôm skeptical politicians motives. demand everyone stay house months end sure hell better make sure relief second it‚Äôs available Bro whole world can‚Äôt stop start every time case pops up. virus never go away, especially since still don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs true origins. think leave restrictions place lion's share population vaccinated? Huh? Death normal. It‚Äôs tragic. Dying bombs exploding however quoted abnormal defunding Canada's vaccine industry goes back 30 years, power house polio era. sold bit bit, almost entirely con governments. recent history Canada pledged front runner corona type viruses vaccines SARS quickly backpeddled Harper elected.  agree you, many Americans don‚Äôt care virus, except wear mask. They‚Äôre mad that. That‚Äôs concern probably most. economy fine, we‚Äôre number 1 lol. market record highs. People working, restrictions dropped money‚Äôs rolling. could better, time heal that. point Americans don‚Äôt give fuck Canada. ones even thinking it. suck. that‚Äôs is. tens thousands people dying every week mention people look like you‚Äôre crazy. 

We plenty people care too, there‚Äôs many don‚Äôt, defeats point taking precautions, they‚Äôll ruin anyway. Greed selfishness seems theme year here. New York population density 420 people per square mile, Florida's 400. New York's higher world difference. None died, lot likely suffered psychological damage. Yes. thought March Florida going bloodbath yet ended roughly half death rate New York. Yeah, fully support public option US. states already offer it, less. health insurance via state government lived Minnesota, low-income anything. Super easy qualify, affordable. end day, Oregon, Michigan, New Mexico tremendous success used cautious measures. Comparing Florida cherry picked epicenter pandemic early days per capita basis absurd really thanks!  would government mandate. people still dying significant numbers, lockdowns still need place. lockdowns need apply vaccinated people ***Florida checking - wait, things closed? Hm, yeah was. 'flatten curve 3 weeks', 'masks anything', etc. really. It‚Äôs likely overwhelmingly safe. it‚Äôs still possibility. vaccine 100% effective helps they‚Äôre isolated island Go Biden! florida lot older too? would stock 200 million doses June. second shipment arrived yesterday less 1 million doses total far. even planning start vaccinating general population July. Scott Gottlieb continues optimistic end public experts, saying return normalcy spring/summer US. Yet, still says come next fall/winter, we'll probably need pull back extent. seems banking hard seasonality effects variants causing enough problems back end, also find difficult foresee many issues (at least initial) vaccination process complete, seems vaccines actually reasonably effective variants, pharma companies already getting ahead variant vaccines needed.

I know - guess I'm trying justify we'll fine retreat restrictions stuff return reasonable degree normal vaccinated sounds demoralizing, wish got reasoning behind predictions. answer probably simply remains much uncertainty. someone living alone, would 100% rather wear mask social distance wear masks still social distance. EU based principles solidarity cooperation. would meaningless collaborate countries critical time comes. immediate I'm sure change lot day-to-day, 3 4 months ton people vaccinated huge. likely means mostly maskless distance-free summer, least USA. people blind. Even though Florida's government restrictions, society Florida moved yet. what's definition success then? deaths ""fail"" entire world?

Why must Sweden always compared neighbors? New Zealand Taiwan? top 33% Europe shows definitely best strategy hardly failed one. keep reading click bait articles tells bad Sweden. mainly brought it‚Äôs likely gonna next major event experts gonna freak about.

Tbh, think people Super bowl parties Fauci spoke would‚Äôve hadn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs human tradition opposite told. I‚Äôm flying Air Marshal anything? live one enforces mask rules even wanted to, police stretched thin judicial system joke means nothing anyway. yes nothing it. Type 1 Type 2, diabetes relentless. I‚Äôm sure dad appreciated care concern. diagnosis one ‚Äúbefore after‚Äù moments lives. probably wear vogmask wear kn95 cloth mask top I'm indoor location 5 min. 

The nose clip vogmask works great rarely fogging issues.

The nose clip kn95s stiff get glasses pretty far mask prevent fogging. That's actually one reasons I've started doubling - cloth masks better fit help prevent fog.

Basically, even clip, masks better face shapes.

Incidentally, problem surgical masks. New sub, gut-feeling comparison sweden norway, finland denmark fair comparison. Yet people argue point view thread heavily downvoted.

What missing here? Could someone ELI5? (: feel like never read news pandemic. news forever. Pay per click advertising made even worse. us know take news headlines face value. can‚Äôt go drinking anyway mask need go away point. [here - real world data Scotland suggests Pfizer reduces hospitalisation 85% AZ reduces 94%. 

So theory day two feeling like flu significantly lower chance ending hospital. Current data looks great vaccines prevent spread covid. turns do, literally point vaccinated person wear mask. sooner people get jab, lives saved sooner reopen everything. reason skip highly effective vaccine. None.  Almost every entertainment venue. covid ICU admission rates local large hospital dropping last summer. vaccination program continues momentum could huge relief summer year. might throwing masks away yet least death serious illness rates related covid very, low. Trump right! Like miracle gone Easter.... Oh wait. mean, positing vaccine manufacturers left Harper attacked scientists.

Conservative government censorship government employed scientists adjacent concept doesn‚Äôt show causation.

That link doesn‚Äôt particularly show Harper ran country. wear goggles public prevent contact eyes. care look ridiculous. you‚Äôre able file independently year, eligible money tax return lifetime odds dying car accident actually [1 102 guess get another motor vehicle again, yeah? mean resident tourist? Probably fine tourist (if black), make sure travel insurance. love see subreddit turned end world almost good news year. Thankful things finally turning around! Come on. I'm sick ""OMG event people get together coming up, there's gonna SURGE"" headlines. like month half away. Relax. 6th doesn‚Äôt seem bad grand scheme things. Especially consider nations sit us percentage GDP spent nations sit right us. Americans get idea didn‚Äôt anything, did. US fairly large population major business industry takes lot stimulate. Big money makes vaccines go brrrrrr!

Thank attending TED talk.  go trying normalize vaccine passports daily life. Ayyy that‚Äôs me. Even though I‚Äôve living since mid 2019 still dependent jobless 6 months due Covid, nope stimulus coming me. disagreeing anything said, coming scientific community, I've read lot terrible journal papers questionable data - presumably ""publish die"" prominent academia. trend exasperated fact publications rarely verified reproduced research groups unless claims especially egregious. Best get AZ one then. Better Pfizer ;). [200k think Gottlieb camp even divided two subgroups: really optimistic folks think go back 2019 April May, realistic people think path normalcy slow slog fall. college professor start classes 9am every morning, she'd wait 15-20mins leave. recall 1 time, actually gave us lecture... go course syllabus first day.

Words people say right air marshall drags fight.  Couple likely work low paying job anti masking idiots running around pay catch Covid.. Early serology reliable. Talk doctor getting lab test. really think spike much all. Easter older people holiday almost elderly older people vaccinated. Im canada say sept people get shot. Im surprised since country sold domestic pharmaceutical production essentially outsourced countries. course, leaders keep going many contracts have. basically screaming much rely countries vaccines. Big joke anyone link actual paper? original press release mentions published pre-print SSRN cannot find Cases may low levels vaccination high enough matter point. Plus weather might nice enough places outdoor gatherings. enough politicians bureaucrats! point long ago. Somewhere around May-June. water wet?  Sorry remember like years long debate high school reason. even *is* exit criteria mask mandates US? understand might necessary since enough people gotten vaccines, I'm paranoid governors mayors continue keep effect even people receive vaccines, often using variants (misguided) justification. Dr. Fauci others wanting masks remain place rest 2021 I'm holding breath. cheapest effective Pfizer preventing hospitalizations hence 'arguably' better. main thing effective AZ much better Vaccine EU, Macron, German media, Fauci etc given credit future spring breaks missing first three sucks ass someone knowledgeable me, 90 120 days line, shows vaccine efficacy 32%. mean imperative get 2nd dose 90-day mark?

Yeah look error bars measurement. efficacy 90s -142% 82% (yes efficacy negative - means vaccine would actually increase likelihood infected rather reducing). commenter said, sample size group small draw conclusions. Sorry wrong place ask Bird Flu thing, sub seems people know.

So like, putting aside ""Russia could possibly lying"" talk time being, exactly situation?

I see folks say ""It's okay guys, transmit people clamped it"" others saying ""this buys us time"" sort.

Is like something *could* problem (and probably teaches closed-in livestock good thing) something currently motion?

Look I‚Äôm saying though, way counted vastly different. I‚Äôm curious flu would treated way they‚Äôve treated covid.

I never seen study links population density increase close contacts. Please share established.

I think density matters way less people think, reason large international cities got hit hard people bringing virus in. Superficial contact people public transit store probably driving spread rather close contacts work social groups believe scale population density. think realistic likelihood Easter cause spike?

Person dies right COVID? Heartbreaking.

Unvaccinated person dies 6 months COVID? Oh no...anyways. lies. go ahead continue fear monger online contribute mental health pandemic. Yes, trying say - less cases symptomatic COVID-19 necessarily mean less likely infect others sterilising immunity, data needed get accurate answer. That‚Äôs exactly happened Spanish Flu Pandemic. Millions people died, party time roaring 20s. Got got I'm fuckin blind without glasses amount. fact taxed without representation. Buy silicon cup sleeves , water proof, come variety bright colours.

Yeah, there‚Äôs kids don‚Äôt wear them, I‚Äôve seen hundreds times parent wearing mask teenage child is.  think recently running low slow vaccine rollout. personally know least 5 people received vaccines. 2 work hospitals 3 80+ years old. That's places like Africa, far know‚Äînot England, France, Japan, those. mention vaccines around quite while. vaccines COVID still, mention using brand-new method (mRNA) tested years, let alone one year. means we'll back normal  UK variant line media error, conflating two things probably said stuff get aired. 

The main UK variant, B-117, meaningfully resistant vaccine. There's sub-mutant developed E484K mutation problematic. someone asks mask wearing going continue 2022 answer emphatic no. 

Or could conclude wearing masks crowded situations good precautionary measure general, covid. requirement, personal choice. would take American healthcare Canadian system day, assuming decent insurance US. pretty average job, nothing fancy, insurance covers 80% cost need see doctor whatever. part pay still less extra income taxes would pay Canada, wait times doctor's appointments, etc minimal. Depends state. don‚Äôt think definitive timeline young healthy people get vaccinated (unless you‚Äôre essential worker.) Yes. negotiating contracts back July, wanted avoid US case Trump held back shipments re-election. Ripples nationalism guess. reason afraid much PPE ordered. Mortality rates going higher average long time. almost get Moderna USA trump laws forbidding that, murica first

Pretty sure Germany didn‚Äôt buy much Moderna, don‚Äôt see that‚Äôs anyone else‚Äôs fault. UK applauded early on, anything opposite.

Whilst Pandemic raging across Italy idiot Prime Minister shaking hands covid patients telling everyone nothing worry about.

We locked least two weeks late..

After Government failed every step. blew billions pounds giving mates contracts PPE, giving companies created weeks contracts worth tens millions.

They spent 20+ billion Trace, Track Test system even work well.

Everyone, even likes Daily Mail S*n, two newspapers effectively Tory mouth pieces blasted Government due piss poor handling.

I can't believe I'm even type this. Never said wasn‚Äôt? I‚Äôm still going feel way feel though lol.

I'm not. one least fear-mongering things he's done. don‚Äôt think near point. Maybe relaxed? don‚Äôt know masks won‚Äôt needed. thought lucky retirement set retire around 50, that‚Äôs awesome smart part. Suck Canada. USA!

You dealt doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs thing. Thanks information Yeah, wear mask go out, I‚Äôm point (especially since got first shot) I‚Äôm like, fuck restrictions.

People saying exact thing. keep replying ‚Äúwell hate comparison.‚Äù whatever. Sorry math hurts brain you. Same. Though would say federal government actually authority healthcare, provincial level.

I hope see major government trade barriers foreign made vaccines, drugs essentials. way get made again. Make impossible import them. (after building facilities though). 

Heck, even making masks, gowns, etc done here. wasn‚Äôt shifting goal posts back Well we've beat covid then. Masks off, lockdowns cancelled. can't confirm personally, seems Florida pretty much open. honest, things open masks social distancing. Restaurants 25-33% capacity, movie theaters same. Many schools continuing remotely though, mainly semesters already started hard rope people back in. honestly think many schools go back person learning summer break though. didn‚Äôt happen New Zealand? Could menstruation changes happen woman administration COVID-19 vaccine? find almost documentation this. 

Extra: could one study effects? feel way N95 manufacturing US. surprised hasn‚Äôt bigger push bring manufacturing back learned hard way quickly lose access necessary goods don‚Äôt produce ourselves. 

If it‚Äôs possible conjure vaccine year, isn‚Äôt also possible build factories? Belgian vaccinating 2 months now, done 3% population .......3 FUCKING PROCENT make things worse producing them.....ffs man

I wanna see friends Ya lockdowns worked well California. definition death worse getting go prom. Get yourself. Thanks! Ultimately expect new variant mutations significant enough completely nullify effect antibodies produced vaccination. course, could wrong this, far evidence seems optimistic vaccines vatiant. It‚Äôs teachers want stay home. know schools likely really shitty job masks social distancing. Teachers know won‚Äôt safe one listens them.  Including Palestine? whole county high concentration, 2 zip codes. That's starts get fucked up. VIP list makes truly fucked up. People called priority access county commissioner VIP list.

Ten bucks says investigate, may find evidence bribes, would legal elected official accept. here. Caught 2 weeks ago. Lol, sure thing bud. two separate subreddits? Talk like get upvoted. Heck, even he/she got upvoted that. 

Anybody looks see pro vaccine/anti lockdown sub. misunderstanding people anti lockdown also anti vaccine, clearly isn‚Äôt case. needs stop wasting time investigating China.

Better use time looking forward Countries/Continents do:

* Diversify PPE equipment manufacturing away China
* Local/State/Provincial/Federal/Regional Stockpiles rotated regularly keep supplies fresh
* Regional Vaccination Manufacturing vaccines manufactured based location
* Encourage mask wearing flu season
* Whatever else Taiwan/South Korea covered Science backed health measures worse 500,000 unnecessary deaths? Maybe whiner sorry assume that. wrong me. Sorry, ""one year"" ""two years"". know realize average 4-5 years college one significant other. freshman year learn live away home, form new friends, explore hobbies like. sophomore year start notice direction want take career begin working towards help mentors (who anyone meet another student faculty). Junior year apply internships field interest, conduct research, work professors, form connections propel future career. Senior year may job hunting looking graduate school internships year belt. 

These examples average student may look college always adhere order. Many things however taken away students. example, friends STEM cannot work labs closed hence lab internships fields.

This ""Casual thing"" student miss on, detrimental futures hopes finding work post-education. equipped fully employers want us be, resulting harder time solidify career. highly competitive environments mixed laid trying find work. people (laid off) may much experience us thus prefered new graduates. 

COVID terrible results society also terrible. Deaths casual treated such. someone simply claim ""your problems mine"" correct attitude look things. lucky loved ones ok, kids loved ones anymore struggling category stated above. simply ignorant try undermine anyone's losses time. started today!

Setting easy goal beating success, politics. Yeah downvote want stuck hell least another year people refuse wear masks stay home. Stop going vacations flying places. Jesus. people remotely qualified judge risk. unquestioningly take told media authorities. move they. Oh no!!! people say LOL covid affects old obese people clutch pearls said people dying covid 9/11 day months 500,000 people dying consider hoax compared d-day offensive things privatized, takes immense political change things. source salty air bit? many days exposure tested? many days since tested?

Unless magically said ""sorry can't go college anymore tough shit"", didn't.

Shit happens deal it. That's life works. Cannot open I‚Äôm EU. Please tell says.  U.K., it‚Äôs NHS. government made sure Oxford Uni would work Astra instead US company potential Trump export controls.

I know they‚Äôve fucked lot things, vaccines point favour. NHS able anything vaccines all, vaccines need bought manufactured. That‚Äôs easy based EU experience.

The government took series bold risks joining EU scheme stretching gap vaccines, far government made good bets there.


[Yet contract reached Matt Hancock's desk, former adviser said, health secretary refused approve it, include provisions specifically committing supply UK first. fear export controls - EU, US. Mr Hancock worried president Trump would stop vaccines Merck leaving country. university Merck ""as close signing dotted line could be"", stopped going ahead, want risk intellectual property rights Oxford vaccine ending hands single American Except Palestinians. mean fuck right. exactly same, marketed covishield India.

Maybe live conservative state otherwise, majority people still dealing even w vaccines another 10 months more. Sorry bearer bad news sometimes sub feels like wish fulfillment thread speaking sober truths. anyone blame them? Aside lack social interaction, lifetimes they‚Äôve lot shit go down. Terrorist attacks, ensuing wars, housing crash, pandemic, ‚Äúpolitical volatility‚Äù we‚Äôll call it, another round economic housing crisis. I‚Äôm probably even missing lot major historical events!

Things aren‚Äôt looking great. Yeah, that's vaccines cost money countries like Canada paying companies manufacturing them... anything works. buy iPhone paying Apple cover costs, including manufacturing R&amp;D, profit.

I mentioned vaccine developed Germany cause made seem like huge endeavor US alone everyone riding coat tails poor US robbed blind. really international effort. really dumb made laugh loud. Grandma ‚Äúchoked‚Äù ramen vaccine... Lol nope. sub went stupid hated lockdowns end last month.

Fingers crossed good guys coming woodwork Covid! haven‚Äôt dating right hope vaccines out. sent delivery down. driver's name Ted. get them? Maybe *you* need glasses (because couldn‚Äôt see them).

‚ÄúMurica dumb, haha.‚Äù look who‚Äôs bitches now. Hahaha They're right though. Gen z younger millenials full shit here.

I'm looking prospect dealing depression anger management issues rest life. teens 20s sucked fat one.

So forgive I'm sympathetic people who're suicidally depressed high school grad 1st year college like movie pandemic. That's insulting. really LA County I've seen, OC? Different story.

Okay, we're still total dicks whole thing. anybody link drop virus mutations dummies really good? comic care, like XKCD one explained mRNA vaccines.

I've following Germany's lockdown personal reasons, see government citing virus mutations reason extend lockdown. Also, read they've slow vaccine rollout.

So reasoning extended lockdown due mutations good bad? viruses mutate?  Right eat get infected email list back 2009 government bailed auto industry bunch people changed name ComradeWhatever joke. much miracle capitalism. people changed names back. kept using it. Number per capita statistics scientists, researchers, whoever resposible manage pandemic healthcare system. average people, 500000 death worse lower number casualty. I‚Äôm currently 18. shit fucking sucks. Life sl boring long going school. old people thag support closing schools complete dumbasses ruined year, opportunities friends, grades future. Yes. couple factors helped speed trials along huge gobs money thrown problem (drugmakers beg funding) seems little easier usual recruit trial participants (the public knows big deal lot people wanted help out). data trials rolled in, FDA regulatory bodies dropped everything else look results. hate incorrect use ellipses seems like wanting pause moment reflect unfairness it. *cries new york* Well said I'm glad I'm Japan; got COVID vaccine family would poison me, blame vaccine try collect money unusual disease.

Any disease puts ICU, including flu, potentially cause long term damage organs- sick need ICU bed, likely put several organs severe stress point permanent damage one kind another possibility.

But weighing exercise, reduced risks vaccinating categories people significant risk serious illness Covid, justification restrictions personal liberty much lower.

Bear mind heap restrictions could theoretically imposed people's lives would dramatically reduce chance long term illnesses, extend life expectancy improve public health- if, eg, government mandated hour exercise day every adult, made illegal drink excess smoke full stop, simply required anyone maintained unhealthy BMI report stint government run nutrition camp, would prevent huge numbers unnecessary deaths long term- things impact personal liberty seem outweigh public health benefits. especially cases falling across globe

\* cries Estonian \*  feeling sick, go public.  destroyed depressed months pandemic meant picture perfect high school graduation?

Gee, rough. real victim here.

I depressed angry high school ""fun 20s"". logic blow head high school w0s ""gone forever"".

M4A really thing USA lot worse Canada in. common misconception vaccine makes immune virus right away. Peak immunity around 95%, occurs two weeks 2nd dose.

Remember cruise ship docked let Americans disembark would hurt numbers? Every person boat quarantine land infected taken care of.


How using defense production powers 4 months pandemic? Masks social distancing work. Put shampoos one corner, conditioner another, body wash another Holy crap wasn‚Äôt prepared last year open. loud obnoxious ruined 10 courts playing... decorum. don‚Äôt give fuck. don‚Äôt pay vaccine company‚Äôs salaries. probably right. smart interim measure small part population vaccinated, virus near flu severity/spread, able drop requirement. to, we‚Äôre mercy everyone around us. I‚Äôve lost much, can‚Äôt afford lose more. black white. dont go severe restrictions restrictions single day.

Life return normal virus starts disappearing, enough people vaccinated.

The purpose vaccinations drive rate infections, 'to protect people virus'. Luckily usefull side effect, allow reducing restrictions faster. Damn maybe BC got figured better Ontario. could also wrist viewed emergency surgery? ticking time bomb eyelid somehow viewed emergency apparently lmao.

I agree abt bankrupt part. Wish middle ground two systems, US Canada. Masks don‚Äôt give 100% immunity Covid transmission. can't companies make Pfizer Moderna vaccine? government allow this? Peoples lives stake companies worried profit. mean even US' response kept deaths per capita level Germany, that's still 250k deaths arguably best response comparably big/connected Western nation. Killing parents? Totally fine. 

Incorrect statistics? wait minute buddy stand that! 

But H1N1 Covid. Except social media, that‚Äôs big difference there. 

So. 

WW2 deaths killed .3% population? That‚Äôs number cited Covid death rate. care American us lost according you?  Drastic reduction lung capacity, scaring lungs, permanent kidney damage. say that?

But article say Suga aiming secure enough whole population end June, guess referring to? heard that, I've gotta say comment like government like exactly fill optimism. doesn‚Äôt make sense living restrictions nearly year, figure clearly don‚Äôt work, look Florida drastic change cases deaths compared New York California agree I‚Äôm surprised likely keeping secret along lot stuff. Like? California could counted top 15 countries regards total deaths. Sooner gonna take year get everyone vaccinated current vaccines. 

It good make new vaccine barely make any. need make enough everyone world need get shots everyones arms within 2 3 months. happening.

They need open new factories NOW..it seems preparation last year. lockdown solved anything. would made things worse. really think people would listened? guys still wear masks? guy ever shut up. like thought day, daily new headline topic different take. Dude take chill pill days. Survivorship bias. Yeah like family would way better post-war Iran United States. understand delusional sound?? Well US many vaccines got cases. Plus ratio might wrong Canada much people California Glad see people toxic reddit. Starting become twitter I‚Äôm sorry. makes feel better, things pretty lame me. fun college twenties. Hell, thirties favorite far. understand though. heavy burden bear. message fucked Trump there.

Contradictory messaging specifically listed something avoid pandemic rulebook. There's way Fauci know that.

But Trump want masks, Fauci bent backwards avoid situation he'd say one thing ('wear masks') Trump contradict next minute ('no masks'). Fauci tried go nuanced message ('medical people wear masks, social distance everyone else') science finally reached consensus masks vital, Trump still refused budge ended contradictory position Fauci trying avoid.

I guarantee Trump there, Fauci would erred side caution requested everyone mask start. stop trying use New Zealand example, one isolated countries world literally Island. Lockdowns work. ask Spain Italy. California/NYC. let guess, think Cuomo great handling it, yet think Trump ""murderer?"" Lol go away. new vaccine probably ready late summer 2021 look things. Novavax already testing boost like April May Moderna around time checking bad history/math. No... 500,000 deaths American life expectancy dropping entire year, definitely winning. gonna take year get everyone current vaccines. probably new vaccine protect current variants till 2022 take another year vaccinate.

They slow making distributing vaccines. need vaccinate everyone like 2 3 months. time last person gets vaccine vaccine likely useless. scan check lungs? first half... aren‚Äôt. Oh yeah, they're annual occurance harmful flu, right?

""I love poorly educated"" - Trump
You cultits love loved! Oh universal health care works! That‚Äôs keep coming US shit gets real talented doctors.  one vaccine 25% effective vaccine likely end used much. vaccine updated quickly enough distributed enough people stopped one update potentially. think we're going dealing least relatively low level years pandemic aspect largely months Well well well look suddenly decided care large numbers deaths. 

 ‚ÄúSeriously though, care 500k died Covid? lives matter? start caring individual number gets 300k, 3 million. I'm curious, magic number sudden declared king empathy?‚Äù Weve seen evidence covid could serious long term effects though AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, licensed produced India.  black person, looking opportunities leave country y‚Äôall start killing us open. It‚Äôs real close now. Im Cali. know several people died.  confirm fact. There's survivorship bias quote. Assuming American, hear immigrants want green card much. non-American, let assure given plethora social issues plaguing country, many many people criticise America *and* care green card. wear eye protection patients hospital now, per CDC guidance. Granted eyeglasses enough need side barriers too, it‚Äôs better nothing. bet study referring to. Except south African variant vaccine 25 percent effective. variants vaccine may work all. Yet still slow making distributing vaccines. sarcasm need apologize. joke based meme making fun Americans meant highlight chaotic Covid response country. UK producing vaccine. Back early 90s Elementary school walked Walmart anti-fog coatings could buy store. Even gave free samples. lady squirted glasses like week glasses fog once. temporary coating though keep applying. long-term coating lasts 1 - 3 years pay like $100 it. fucking idiot replied dumbass. I've already read articles nothing original comment - people think Florida deliberately suppressing data covid - best article rural medical examiners potentially diagnose covid additional correlation Trump voting counties - point article Florida trying extrapolate - Florida's population 91.2% urban (the 6th highest country) barely even voted Trump 2020 would make significant impact Florida's official covid count?


Then post article probably read discusses Florida's excess deaths October potential explanations excess deaths higher official covid count - including delays reporting, non-covid death upticks like overdoses suicides, mentions Democratic lawmakers asserted state's reporting ""lacking rigor"" - spite excess deaths way lower states evidence conspiracy suppress/manipulate covid death data - whole point original comment chose reply like anything ad discussion never said world coordinated manner together. added that. New Zealand managed eliminate covid-19 country without rest world it. country could turn decide, could chose keep virus active country, like USA decided (not government, anti maskers covid deniers, along ""but freedoms"" people). 
 
The question personal sacrifice could done instead US managed it. answer actually lockdown properly, proof works New Zealand. ‚Äúsources‚Äù misrepresenting situation lying. sources say lockdown Germany going end March 7th. Sure paper, vaccines things pick up, realistically expect anyone believe point? math shows almost everyone either vaccinated previously infection early Fall. 

People 18 years old wont get vaccines 2022 though.  Thats atleast 100 150 million people... Dude live major southern CALIFORNIA county that‚Äôs LA. pandemic even parts county. design trial non-inferiority endpoint, comparison would existing vaccine, instead placebo. 
Some countries could also choose accelerate trials allowing active challenge, volunteers deliberately exposed virus (instead waiting natural infection occur circumstance). It‚Äôs also two countries pretty nationalistic governments, prevented vaccines getting exported. never called hoax, said people blaming hoax. Like now. proving point. It‚Äôs good thing real world data starting show covid vaccines even safe effective expected. received AZ worried since B1531 study unequivocally wonderful news. all, globally, benefit hugely AZ‚Äôs success, including people individually never receive themselves. Whatever else happens, metric fuckton lives saved right now. Lets blame driver crashed train he's longer driving train. much logic. boomers yell ""old generation affected REEEEEEEE""  Read Australians fuming PM got vaccine got good one. 

It's dangerous narrative certain countries media decided use AZ virus. Yeah see that. that's asking.

Unless RCT designed compare two vaccines, compare two vaccines.

They good us deal variants circulating UK/EU right now.  plenty people Australia talking same. Hopefully we‚Äôll reality check them. Thanks read it. CA never really first wave spring summer surge much smaller many parts country. cast majority cases, hospitalizations deaths happened last 3 months. MIL massive brain bleed next day first shot. miss sadly money bring back. üò¢

Of course proof caused death. 84. hope one finds dropped glasses toilet comes COVID there‚Äôs lots crazy there. virus likely lightning strike kill young, otherwise healthy person. Likewise, serious long-term effects mostly seem occur people gravely ill COVID, rare under-50s.

I hope regain sense perspective future, upon seeing farce been. total, 8,000 people ended 58 vaccinated four weeks previously.

Sometimes feels good put numbers perspective. Wonderful news. Thanks It‚Äôs necessary due extremely high population density. places like Tokyo ride subway cars like hundreds packed single car. Many public places packed brim people could easily super spread locations respiratory virus. Thank bravely saying needs said. They'll catch up. 400k would change life. Think speak. Wait another year different vaccine? That's crazy, like actually necessary can. even US. What's funny UK's approach vaccinating people likely die need hospitalisation. teacher/support staff falls one categories (age, vulnerable) get vaccine. got first dose days ago. Side effects brutal, worst flu ever went through, plus tongue swelled bordering dangerous levels. coworker described run train, long train. Another said SmartWatch kept ringing stress alerts tachycardia, used words ""I've seen death""

We're 30's shared experience, workmates 50's suffered pain injection site... Yes secondary moving class class. different kids different years, 30 kids. end 100. Plus, im trainee teacher I'm even paid, I'm literally risking life teach sentence ever thought would say.

Honestly vent I'll still go kids lol hard deal with. Also New York Times awful low grade rag, jumping every crumb AZ negatively, pretty much convinced pension scheme quite lot Pfizer stocks. 

But let's see all, French, Germans alike, tail legs, hopefully making grovelling apologies cause lives lost Anytime take train, bus airplane crosses state borders. Federal parks, buildings, etc. 

That's lot times. full-on federal mandate meaningless either. Well agree over, cases anti vaxxers still think hoax, sadly many people died covid got convinced take vaccine. 4.3 mil got first shot already close reach 70% achieve herd immunity. Also goverment strict people dont want get vaccine meaning cant enter many places like malls,college campus etc, also covid test every 2 days want go school. Pretty sure achieve end month  folks jobs? üòî

By morning [Mar arrivals subject 14 day policed quarantine. yes, policed it.

Two weeks [after state closed borders rest Australia, ""an island within island"".

By Western standards, *very* fast, strict measures too, particularly leveraging island advantage - hinders actually act take advantage it. could easily fumbled lost, acted community cases dozens, hundreds thousands. Made exponentially easier. US similar type compensation fund. stop talking state like we‚Äôre helpless people? voted democratic governor (who switched) democrat senator. Fuck really answer question. starters whole world waiting know vaccine stops spread. time sensitive issue yet treated like isn't. 

Yes peer review important question needed now. Covid cases per day, hospitalizations, deaths plummeting. least one study claiming vaccine stops spread.

I thinks reasonable given circumstances, preliminary data, yes past vaccine successes, formulate plan going back normal. Waiting final piece puzzle point seems redundant.

Also keep mind longer restrictions stay place vaccinated people, that's reason people get vaccinated. there's benefit immune what's point? US might approaching 100 million point many vaccines administered small study sa variant thinking young people it, one died control group. can't claim certain prevents 100%of deaths, even probably does. live Scotland seen talked about, AZ vaccine higher immunity first dose Pfizer one, they're roughly equal Pfizer edges ahead? considering Westminster put rules saying wait 12 weeks doses means AZ seems desirable one right higher immediate protection. Japan done thing exempted manufacturers liability damages. essentially system. discourages compliance restrictions. tell people even vaccines *may* restricted 2022, people going give go back lives.

It's already happening. 1. Society still needs operate...yes, essential level. Protests cause essential objectively speaking (and many developed countries banned protests pandemic).

Atlanta services mix county city services, Georgia, counties typically stronger service delineation point cities. example, Atlanta's water sewer service done (mostly) county level. Despite many incorporated cities, schools metro Atlanta region done county level. another example, Atlanta jurisdiction Atlanta airport despite fact 95% airport Atlanta. 

My point - terms defining metropolitan area - city boundaries completely arbitrary. yes, know ""find"" city's borders. point average Atlantan, effects boundaries trivial. meaningful terms geography, population centers, commerce centers. makes sense.

The point masks make risk spreading COVID much lower would otherwise society still needs operate. heavy usage masks BLM protests made things far less risky would otherwise. Furthermore, protests outdoors already proven COVID spreads much less outdoors. ""beaches spread COVID!!!!"" argument again, also disproven.

Furthermore, BLM protests proven repeatedly contributed heavy spread. want argue something that's proven researched, guest. clearly sort ax grind I'm gonna help you, nice day.

CARES Act passed quickly also really helped lot us shut industries. clear going last lot longer things kind broke patchwork different states different lockdowns clear lot less help caring containment government whole mess. week lockdowns started went worst shit life put worst depression ever in. leave house aside work sit room dwell happened made everything much worse me. Last year turned 21 something looked forward really since little kid big plans got completely ruined.

I know others gone worse I'm extremely lucky know anyone died COVID, probably going take long time move effects mental health Wait what? undeniable spikes around thanksgiving Christmas. either haven‚Äôt looked you‚Äôre purposefully ignorant. mean, literally destroy entire idea simply using Google.

It‚Äôs people like you, foresight whatsoever, distrust people actually foresight, reasons pandemic got control did. hope you‚Äôre ashamed. Australasia restricted travel China early too. Sweden's statistics likely reliable many countries. That's whole condom dilemma Fauci said double masking common sense that's sufficient evidence some. love armchair psychiatrist, economist, sociologist etc. downvote don‚Äôt care. Fauci political hack point. companies aren‚Äôt making profits vaccine vaccine effort success no? Vaccine nationalists everywhere, I‚Äôve noticed they‚Äôre pretty rampant UK sure must countries. I‚Äôm convinced state disinformation though gonna now? virus endemic option get vaccine ASAP unless wanna piss people ineffective lockdowns.  Vaccines H1N1 where?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep. honestly US really way. States able set restrictions convincing US south parts lockdown mask up. shitty situation would hard stop lot governors US. UK presented roadmap exiting lockdown, im UK really gives hope, would great normal summer. least come out, I‚Äôm sure politicians, public health experts, media enablers going lining apologize public wrong Clearly teachers trying get priority.  Let guess, teacher? Pathetic development new type mRNA vaccine 2 world: BioNTech (Germany), Moderna, manufacturing capacity make millions doses months - AZ deliver aaayy LOL

Not that, even said: yo J&amp;J, make juice well!

AZ even approved Switzerland, probably even approved USA. Yikes.

All while, EU exports millions vaccines, European American countries established cradle global vaccine development, EU. many vaccines UK exported anyone? **ZERO** ROFLOL sub lol well course aspects effects vaccines important too. scientist suppose vaccine lower viral load levels cause hospitalization, level still transmissable. still great news reduces hospitalization rate though, need discredit that. lot countries risk ICUs overrun one main drivers behind lockdown measures. vaccines get hospitalization down, hopefully open sooner vaccines H1N1. pretty successful mass vaccination campaign. 

Other you‚Äôre right, nothing else changed Pubs open indoors three months final first doses taken effect. Around 30% hospital 50. mid-April onwards, excluding vulnerable healthcare workers, abandoned fate, individually unlikely hospitalised, plenty overwhelm NHS every adult vaccinated. Meanwhile transmission won‚Äôt fully suppressed children vaccinated. carnage next even traumatic lockdown inevitable businesses even recovered costs reopening. disagree. Vaccines typically hard bring market viruses evolve fast. US made rational decision socialize risk potential long term rare side effects would difficult get data real virus causing damage health general population. one reasons US ahead curve comes Covid-19 vaccine procurement distribution. looks this, apparently believe real pandemic isn‚Äôt issue concerned regularly scheduled exercises drills prepare one. world view literally backwards real life functions.

You need seriously go therapy. distrust stems really strange place need find way tether back reality. Germany talking it, UK taking lead actually researching Italy actually first European country restrict travel Asia. Turns pointless, virus Europe since least November. end decided affected countries mainly luck. Almost like certain someone correct said news fake cases, positivity, hospitalizations, deaths dropping. think it... little I'm saying though. I'm talking AZ's poor communication production capacity. zero business talking stimulus. Wow. Nice way say kids going back say regardless parents/tax payers want.  Oh wow! I'm sorry hear diagnosis, good news begin treatment &amp; hopefully start better days soon ü§ûüôè

It definitely easier get diagnosis bloodwork shows positive.

I remember telling Rheumatologist first appointment thought pain getting old looked said, ""you're way young that.""

So validating confirmation pain normal, cause everyone else around saying, ""oh that's part getting older!"" 

I'm sure GF feels similar relief answers &amp; validation.

Definitely check RA autoimmune subreddits. super helpful navigating new territory. One many?... speaking necessity lockdowns social distancing guidelines keep ""even one person"" dying, get here. one likes you. Every country higher death per capita developed nation Europe. realize he's politician. He's couching words pulling punches win votes. expert opinion leading epidemiologist infectious disease specialist. Mind he's talking scientific viewpoint, social &amp; business factors exert huge influences decision making. Florida currently living Summer 2022 according article. Americans need develop appetite nuanced information instead yeehaw nonsense. would happened said masks important needed reserved hospitals months? 

My guess afford cheat system would bought mask supplies (which kind happened anyway), would angry toppled government response started (which again, might made huge difference based going). Sadly balance went window. literally never seen country criticized going far long restrictions needlessly. seriously hope another pandemic scare within lifetime nothing learned anything reaction harsher. üëäüèª Many people ascribe declining population justifying immigration, regardless think place talk politics. Illinois lowest cases tests positivity since July, seems like state finally getting shit together vaccines. depends quickly developed world gets disease contained. know right people? Nobody know who‚Äôs symptoms.

I think may depend age personal contacts anything. 

Of 8 people know who've it, two died, two complications lingered 6 months (cardiac scarring, neurological issues) one flu like symptoms fine two weeks later, one lung issues 2-3 months seems recovering, one hospitalized home weeks, recently.

The age spread mid 40s late 50s, part, two people 70s (both lived, required hospitalization.) He's trying copy Trump, probably hoping seen Trump 2.0 running president 4-8 years. beat it. *lot* countries haven‚Äôt even started vaccinations, barely started. Israel really set bar high. feed wrong food.  Sweden Scandinavian country periphery Europe. obviously compared neighbours.

Europe general done terribly. New Zealand obviously done well extremely isolated. reason all, apart extreme incompetence, Europe handling pandemic well Asia however. Vietnam South Korea models Europe following. Vietnam particular shares land border China hasnt suffered death toll efficient systems place.

Lord knows would happen Vietnamese relying Johnson, Macron Tegnell keep safe. self employed boss worry about.

I also American. problem world over. asking fir systemic change now. Especially regards climate change. old prepared change. want drive ICE cars, eat way meat anyone needs go cruise ships. care us. Even beg day day out. care.

So sorry sad selfish pricks make it. Maybe housing prices drop. That‚Äôs another subject that‚Äôs fault. Voting parties want keep housing prices high loose investments. Daughter NYC union carpenter here. Lay offs happen. injuries. watched father destroy body. year away retirement blew rotator cuff told finished. 

Trades needed, pay well. lets stop pretending way roses. Paid actors? Dude insane.

The people ‚Äúact‚Äù members response organization reading situations piece paper. Sometimes front camera. Sometimes don‚Äôt.

In every situation, it‚Äôs someone standing front group people saying ‚ÄúThere report (insert situation here) currently ongoing. on-scene weather conditions, things need concerned (evacuation, hazardous materials area, organizations becoming involved). goals.‚Äù 

Obviously, drills, things ACTUALLY happening. drill. practice real thing.

The person works company says things group people well aware they‚Äôre running drill, believe count ‚Äúpaid actor‚Äù?  thing compared one group get vaccine another group time frame. Therefore groups experienced effects lockdown difference (more-or-less) attributed vaccine. know anyone personally died Covid? do, woman fifties mother two. sad shit died Im fine distancing make sure tradgedies like dont happen. youre not, fine. someone suicidal distancing, course probably step outside. taking unnecessary risks stupid. whats really self defeating attitude Americans towards covid. didnt bad. Half million people didnt need die. restrictions

let know give someone heart attack breathing near them. HERES SITUATION Send help... Sure let's compare USA Lichtenstein, USA looks horrible comparison (okay, there's good way look US numbers, comparison probably one makes least sense). That's said ""per capita"" European country comparable population. US far better say UK long run.

Ooof! Comparing developed nation UK right punching down. think many nations emerge pandemic quickly regain footing, US. Must nice... Mexico 2020 around 40% came moderate case asthma college couple decades ago weirdly enough single attack since shortly start quarantine. even quit using steroid inhaler, something never would able previously.

I assume related staying healthy time, sick since last March. strangest thing. happen, friend group freshman year basically split half breakup, I‚Äôm still good friends half. feel like Fauci like one stereotypical geniuses elite craft, lacking terms social awareness message delivery perceived (think Sheldon Big Bang Theory). matter says true not, someone position public spotlight perception interpretation unfortunately critical message since directly impacts people respond. Fauci (and whole nation) could benefit ""marketing"" communications/pr team... exactly like you, trying best never catch it. long term side affects kinda scary. Wait, use supplies given ? *They* fail anticipate that. *You* failed anticipate that.

I'm losing patience Canadians bothered listen government announcements. Stop getting news reddit maybe would seen one many many articles government expects delays due lack house production.

They ability pull pfizer production facility ass moment's notice. think point pandemic, Fauci realizes speak scientific vantage point, try couch words appease one political faction another. may like message (whether Democrat GOP) silencing messenger one good. Young people lowest priority group (intact, UK even included priority group), least months young people get offered vaccine. Bannon? This. Whatever think toll is, higher, ones we've roughly managed confirm. even know figured WTF meant. know what's annoying people believe masks? People wear masks outside stores *show* ""I'm taking seriously"", take masks private gatherings, Covid cases linked winter/fall surges. what's point berating ""anti-maskers"", people wear masks they're needed most? wearing mask consistently (when really needed) bad wearing still people complaining masks acting like mass oppression look others 1. Limits large gatherings - 50 since March, dropped 8 since November.
2. Social distancing - free time, work time, distance work available, different work regulation distance work isn't. includes also recommendations ""social bubbles"" measures allow people public distance. Includes distance learning secondary higher education students usually socially distance person.
3. Government support limit spread - means social safety net allows report sick suspect might sick subject others potential transmission. allows stay home take care sick kids worry losing job, house means put food table. ""Stay home experience symptoms"" said, done people able report ill 21 days without needing doctor's certificate received 80% work salary entire duration. Support businesses cut workers hours, government instead pays difference 80% salary worker would normally receive, order keep businesses working workers contracts.
4. Wash hands, keep good hygiene, cough hands, avoid touching face hands clean, etc. aware body exhibiting symptoms. Self-isolate suspect anything.
5. Recommendations/limitations travel - includes international, national, local even. Avoid unnecessary travel, avoid unnecessary travel within country 2 hours distance, avoid using public transport unless to, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Sweden plenty recommendations traveling, movement still one harshest restrictions public gatherings. tend think terms local cities (Long Beach, CA, 2nd largest city L.A. county), NYC Boroughs (Staten Island) Nordic countries (Iceland). think wrong way look it. They're excellent. going vary widely state. you‚Äôre stuck California Illinois, maybe. you‚Äôre Florida, you‚Äôre probably ahead already.

It‚Äôs going depend long guys like Pritzker Newsom want drag states, long they‚Äôll put events, businesses, taxpayers moving states. Sanofi manufacturing Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine vaccine failed work. Pathetic really, salty granny fucking president called Oxford vaccine 'pseudo ineffective' even though turned effective Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine real world. much behavior changing policies formally put place? stopped going bars/restaurants ban events happened... hell, already trying work home days could happened.

Ok, case order would little explaining power assuming people countries behaved roughly way (stopped going bars/restaurants regardless order closing not). 

I'm exactly sure after. people would restricting activities regardless restrictions governments putting place roughly time governments setting restrictions, naturally restrictions effect. 

But like saying governments ban smoking restaurants happens time restaurants ban smoking inside properties, ban effect people's smoking. overall effect people stopped smoking smoke anymore restaurants really matter government ban restaurant's ban lead reduction smoking. show credit card use restaurants fell massive amount prior imposing restrictions restaurants, may mean restaurant restrictions might bigger impact shown here, imposed earlier. 

Well, guess depends want measure. guess could say results sort minimal effect certain measures had. case schools, that's probably close total effect kids stopped going schools closed. case gatherings use non-essential businesses may indeed drop before. 

So, anything makes case lockdowns (meaning closing schools businesses, prohibiting people walking outside homes) *stronger* study says. think question anti-lockdown crowd saying, namely lockdowns ""pointless"" (see one comment comment section). Lockdown 7s vaccinated 5% vulnerable unvaccinated 

That's going sorted first restrictions eased March rest would people turned vaccine who's fault plus full hospitalisation 50s spring. NHS overwhelmed. 

Every adult UK going offered vaccine July 31st time restrictions unwound ,to point large amount social mixing, vast majority population protected vaccine also cuts transmission. unvaccinated point people amount less 1% hospitalisations. 

I'm 20 want go longer roadmap sets vulnerable vaccinated can't stay locked negatives lockdown far outweigh benefits I'd rather spend next 50 years life paying off

I'm anti vaxxer, covid denier anti lockdown stretch vaccines it'd foolish maintain level lockdown till 7s vaccinated. We're already facing massive wave mental health problems untreated illnesses also concerned bad economic devastation evictions/ mortgage/ small business protections withdrawn. Poverty impacts public health too.... post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* dont know man, told flu appreciate article trying optimistic. positive tone clearly indicates *it* thinks optimistic, clear improvement absolute doom we've getting year. hard read gate feel It‚Äôs unlikely enough people get vaccinated spring restore normalcy. fact, experts fear pandemic could get much worse near term, variants virus contagious vaccine-resistant original version begun circulating United States. damage variants still unknown; ‚ÄúMarch May mystery,‚Äù colleague Robinson Meyer wrote earlier Another outcome [for fall] seems less probable troubling: Whether variant ends evading existing vaccines infections surge among unvaccinated people, cases might climb again. Even wonderful summer, rise cases could necessitate reversion many precautions earlier pandemic, even doesn‚Äôt require full-on lockdowns.

An incredibly effective vaccine booming rollout, cases freefall despite variants world, carrot. patient, though incredibly upset, year restrictions. I'm sure I'm one would strongly oppose initiative go back vaccination widespread certainly case probably Fall 2021. well - apart optrician said, go many academics shortsighted versus average ""normal"" person... Basically engineering / science jobs find way glasses-wearers bet dollar 90% shortsighted. Outdoor swimming pools open March England? feel like that's bad idea reasons nothing covid.

Also weddings funerals different limits anyway? infections started creep back slightly. surprising given much busier streets become lately. know getting downvoted that. say, great news, headline somewhat misleading. wondering many vaccines Scotland rolled entire hospitalization rate dropped 94%. moment, thought could open way quicker total number hospitals dropped dramatically. include phrase ""among single shot vaccine recipients"" it'd add much information.   would insert comment gym, too, room talk. cancelled mine April still rejoined. feel like type people would superbowl party pandemic type people already engaged risky behavior exposed virus long time ago Maybe read article Yeah get it. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs limited teachers hopefully states start allowing teachers get realize anyone building needs get it. Don‚Äôt give hope yet year since Covid, still can't rest back, still get hateful headaches still run breath quite quickly.

Deaths one measure effects. One big reason successful though UK use production capacities EU factories exporting nations like Israel even UK. boat, friend. sick, symptomatic, 8 weeks ago. get tested cannot drive bear idea putting someone else risk. family, Uber drivers, anyone all.

So fell ill, bad. annoying anything. Feverish, cold chills, weird metallic taste bitter, damn tired. went away overnight. came back week later 10 times worse.

Doc told phone assume wait months vaccination, even became available group.

But still changes nothing. proceed safe way behave right now.

I hopeful nearing end, maybe help heal rest world soon. learned pattern yet, you? 

Without vaccines:

Cases increase people panic less social interactions cases drop people stop panicking social interactions increase cases increase people panic...

With vaccines:

Cases drop people stop panicking social interactions increase cases increase thanks vaccinations pandemic CT, I‚Äôm substitute teacher though, I‚Äôm temping operations department. Archived link: first tip lets know media fear-mongering they're calling ""pandemic."" really need clicks things looking world.

I'm saddened ""long-haulers"" trying insensitive, media despicable trying use new fear clicks. biggest thing hear binging Covid deaths huge number, deaths many things, namely flu, way down. 

Does anyone good analysis sheds light true is. IE thing many bringing many flu deaths called Covid, truly Covid would flu years. 

Just looking detail could share people. Depends quickly vaccines distributed thought serious kek think Dr. Fauci would put UK Italy list richly-resourced economically advanced nations wayward political stewardship leading poor outcomes, especially compared Canada &amp; Germany. think oddman would Japan, equally inept &amp; denial, yet suffered less 1/20 deaths US. Ah yes, America culture culture racist. happen Harvard professor chance? idea why? seem make sense. Pfizer clearly better choice elderly based current data (we simply know AZ). guess understand criteria ""back normal"".

Like, one mRNA vaccines see little reason ought keep COVID practices given news morning they're also effective preventing spread. Giving freedom movement away terrible mistake. think lockdowns reduced mortally comparing places many restrictions vs really difference live lost. One mask stop either called for. biosecurity theater along people could feel safe feel something done. agree said. However, people want normalized situations, strongly disagree that. Yeah, Vietnam, that's 50,000 people never chance live full life. average age soldier Vietnam 22. comparable.  Why? variants every country? Don‚Äôt let make believe money isn‚Äôt really economy stop. isn‚Äôt true, goals would lead collapse society. 

I, people, take covid that, thank you. Stop trying pretend don‚Äôt exist. Well, first thanks reply using downvote diasgree moving on. 

Regarding risk factors- Interesting, point taken relative risk obesity v. age. data clearly shows point there. 

I would say another factor put US disadvantage though compared developed countries terms fighting pandemic, inequality US terms access health care, lack worker protections, lack social safety net. US alone among developed world universal healthcare, many afraid going ER due crippling medical bills. Workers less powerful US harder time demanding safety precautions, may less able take time work exposed COVID-19.

There big problems American society think made us uniquely vulnerable pandemic. problems still next pandemic fix it. make problems US response lockdowns test trace, think miss opportunity highlight deep systemic problems exacerbated pandemic.

Regarding US vs. countries- Australia New Zealand, Western country success Asian countries combatting pandemic. know USA could achieved AUS/NZ given anti-authority tendencies, decentralized political control (Can Fed. govt even order quarantine) international connections- Fauci said among worst. We're Australia New Zealand, certainly prefer compared say France 6 PM curfew countries rules outdoor socializing. specify part comment ""cringe."" Jump conclusions, much?  also hope coming close US regarding vaccination. government indeed fuck whole lot, countries worse shape coming months. EU looks fucked next whole year Whatever say borger Osterholm say spring wave? (I believe him.) think American businesses deserve credit leader USA gave fighting virus order prioritize things narratives found important... mention hitting period increased vaccine delivery case numbers already dropping like rock. 80% areas. fewer people spreading virus, increasingly fewer potential hosts virus spread to. mean, getting better folks. live Chicago. police always take credit decrease crime month February.
 
They applaud efforts foot patrols, community outreach citizens right thing. May, we‚Äôre back record gun violence.
 
It‚Äôs weather. It‚Äôs constantly 0-20 degrees, snowing miserable. People stay inside it‚Äôs like this. brought Russia China? arguing false point policy makers want continue restrictions summer. feel same. Every single person know got completely fine   believe so, still three weeks, longer process Pfizer Moderna course vaccines kill you, vaccines appear less effective others, actual information shot real choice important. Please name country 500,000 dead citizens coronavirus. won‚Äôt happen. officials likely roll back decisions saying metrics haven‚Äôt met. Ah mistake, could've sworn filed EUA around time J&amp;J must mistaken read vaccine acceptance among younger people lower. hope changed protected much possible variants. Also new variants might worse way hosts develop in. host, chance mutate. even vax perfect allowing illness speed fast body clear give virus less time mutate. vaccine, rolled national immunization program began Dec. 20, 89.4% effective preventing laboratory-confirmed infections  live actually passed bylaws allowed outdoor drinking parks last spring Thank you! hahaha actually think people like restrictions. US worst outbreak Earth, complete lack basic critical thinking.

You whatever want, rest us learn cooperate without you.

Don't blame Russia China nobody listens wisdom anymore. also never said year Spanish speakers get offended centuries-old grammar rules. ""Latinos"" encompasses males females alike offensive. people using terms like LatinX projecting sensibilities population need want ""help"". irrational angry thread made me. much hysteria doubt part politicians handled it.  might slightly vague 8n FDA approval status, fairly irrelevant outside US. EU, vaccine hoods "" conditional approval"" EMA, basically real approval, commits manufacturer 9erform studies, clarifying specific issues, covered phase 3 trials. ""You receive vaccine prevent dying. want Y/N?"" looking terms whether individuals might die sooner... again.. That's point..

The point whether prior average life expectancy die COVID determined based solely age death vs national aggregate lifespans.. Nobody claiming anyone would died sooner... saying certainty died would lived average age average population hardly supported simple age comparison.

You trying desperately make something personal, responses article scientific study personally disparaging article study themselves... say, all.  issue question quite simply one statistical validity matter much want make personal health problems.  op used wrong flair. fixed it. always modmail us incorrect flairs fix. Zero covid worldwide plausible goal fast-mutating respiratory virus endemic nearly every country world animal reservoirs. obvious since early last year something circulates population seasonally like flu like cold-causing coronaviruses. immune systems exposed super bad thing initially. We'll vaccinate it, vaccines adjust keep mutations, yes people die every year like flu. half million dying year, ""lock stay home"" response. yet, experiencing decline daily cases deaths like countries. facilities built summer later. Manitoba bypassed trudeaus garbage vaccine plan ordering providence therapeutics vaccine. use new facilities multiple make it.


Anyways pointless Canada virus defeated April/May. Half population vaccinated numbers active cases tiny we're gonna pockets virus completely surrounded vaccinated people. Canada never needed vaccinate entire population win vaccine race. counter measures vaccine. People tend develop strong emotional response crises tragedy personal connection (such family member friend dying). Large-scale death tolls rationalized human mind really mechanism grieving kinds numbers we're talking about. lived small hunter-gatherer societies existence, mourning collective loss millions something we've evolved register. said lot people don‚Äôt want shot people already COVID

Do data back up? less? what?

Restrictions, lockdowns, mask mandates, asking believe fewer restrictions Lombardy, would fared better? think anyone believes that.

I get understand Sweden then. Lombardy failed much worse Lombardy Sweden. treat patients overall treatment options hospitals still poor. Sure, Italy many countries could done much better care homes, doubt.

But maybe realize many people travel daily get work, many fill public transports otherwise way go work. difficult isolate region like Lombardy outbreak rip apart working economy, don't, regions get affected by. High population density, active, besides possible higher international movement. 

Sweden much worse neighbors that's fact. Italy worse worse compared EU neighbour anyway near countries. 

What's lesson EU learn Sweden? none is, yeah, Sweden can't really compared every country world people like every country. 1.) that‚Äôs works, all.

2.) consider spreading absurd conspiracy theories contributed deaths ‚Äúmaking world better‚Äù? happy handful Red Bulls fans here! Normal, come! even close true. guarantee you, fifty years number cut half even more. Assistant *to* regional professor speak scientific vantage point, try couch words appease one political faction another

That's start. Yes, matter think kind wave spring largely inevitable given Covid‚Äôs surge patterns. said, vaccinations largely going well, could avoid death associated dare use logic statistics! allow emotions subreddit! I‚Äôm convinced fair way distribute vaccines. punishes nations may done lot keep infection rates down, rewarding little. US handling pandemic many flaws, point country would rather US.

Here, cases / hospitalizations / deaths declining rapidly, vaccine rollout going well, significant public get back normal. 

Compare Canada, Germany, Netherlands, etc. significant problems vaccinations hard lockdowns expected continue months. Probably not, restrictions still place outbreaks again. 

They place outbreak US least again. want restrictions stay though, one forcing leave house. whatever want! Uuuuuuh Malaysia failed fucking state reason trust reporting... know picked 25 countries people could cherrypick results like did. There's enough sample size random outliers due bad data. Sweden 3 - 4 % higher EU-27 average, regarding many lives alone. think 3 - 4% exceptional high. probably made little difference. That's simply true. Quite first world nations quite bit worse us. again, accuracy matters. claiming ""the US worst world"" blatantly false, fauci supposed well informed matters. I'm getting impression that's he's just....dumb? Feels weird say americas top doctor. shit, he's always completely wrong. (And there's always bunch people making excuses it) Shit man, need vacation. give pills stop feeling make world better. I'm none things,but mean I'm going happily wear mask forever. 

My biggest problem expressing opinion particularly like wearing mask gets thrown rabbid anti-masters group way many people. Really doesn‚Äôt matter unless virus mutates 10% mortality people 70 something crazy like that. one going care soon vaccination without herd immunity. Barring crazy mutation like that, people going back normal year western countries even means death. 

Also messaging like furthers apathy anti-vax sentiment. Many ask can‚Äôt go back normal what‚Äôs point vaccine? father since around April around caught virus. minor dizziness times headaches symptom remains. Yea perhaps. 

I‚Äôm hoping don‚Äôt events companies lose money 'blip' less 'snap' please! LOLOL. guys free leave NATO, let China protect Europe. Quite frankly, could divert trillions dollars spent protecting Europe, something else.

China claimed new, better superpower Africa....until governments realised China using strip dry little investing home grown infrastructure/people. know possibility is? Emergency use authorization.

Just wanted make clear none vaccines actually approved since seems common misunderstanding. disagree, feels like talk variants taken coverage COVID. 

On Thursday last week heard Michael Osterholm radio. said variants category 5 hurricane waiting shore. made prediction end March worst pandemic. Right. Nice front. Intuitive, good table early. people Russia wear masks? friend lives goes school normally like 2018. According him, covid ""bullshit"" also wear wanna put makeup on, allergy season, certain work environments (like nursery schools).  Tfw that's illegal bc corona restrictions produce vaccine, wait. think really misunderstood second point quoted on. didn‚Äôt say people who‚Äôve COVID don‚Äôt want shot - said lot people don‚Äôt want shot people already COVID. There‚Äôs difference 2 statements. reason say lot people don‚Äôt want shot already COVID because, generally, people wary shot also tended people wary masks, etc. often people continued life normal, therefore probably make larger portion unreported/untested cases people natural immunity already. Novavax taking little need wait US trial results out. US typically doesn‚Äôt accept trial results countries, even though it‚Äôs UK case. Again: seek therapy. detachment reality clearly negatively affecting mental health. get you‚Äôre saying grand scheme things far world population goes eventually wash periphery right midst pandemic people seem intent downplaying actions really actually make life death difference. husband 36 years, James McIntyre, retired county bus driver Pensacola, Fla., died COVID last July age 70. ""A brutal form gaslighting"" Like Sabila Khan, Jennifer Spitzer Ithaca, N.Y., checks COVID numbers daily, angered every time new threshold reached. ""We're close finish line, seems like,"" says Lori Baron, lost brother Danny Volce COVID earlier month. Homie, talking sense. get downvoted. That's possible.. machinery pipeline required making mRNA vaccines equivalent neededfor GSKs AAV based platform. common step likely last filling step. goal get COVID. let talk anything less, fact folks want good contributor economy completely inconsequential. They‚Äôre saying now, time comes they‚Äôll say haven‚Äôt met numbers something. Plus 90,000 sounds unrealistic. I‚Äôm sure fans allowed less LOLOL. Reminds Canadians going messed US is....and government beg us get vaccines. 

Trudeau Blackface, go pound sand.  wish one them.  say alone also say anecdotally year managers know changing tune regular workers really loved begin with. suspect folks adopt hybrid model work home coupled person work well. know taking toll regular staff well management wonder mad Peter Navarro economist spreading Trump admin lies COVID herd immunity *Incoherent Arnold Schwarzenegger screeching intensifies* Sceptism ok. Dont let downvotes make feel bad. important question I've seen rough summaries methodology another article, seems sound, far bullet-proof.
A peer reviewed article, methodology results thoroughly scrutinized actual experts field, would preferable, yet come across paper, I'll consider valuable, definitive. man! humane! people acutely complying this? cannot imagine living like that...  Don‚Äôt listen director NIAD thirty seven years!! Listen Fox News talk radio!!!!! Estimated Primary Completion Date :
March 31, least two months safety data needed FDA. However, novavax knowledge safety incidents trial expected fewer side effects, US vaccine much longer 2 months already.

After need least 100ish symptomatic cases. placebo arm 15,000 people think (couldn't verify that, whole trial 30,000) implies 0.7% attack rate needed. take masks private gatherings, Covid cases linked winter/fall surges

Because prudent times heavy outbreaks. COVID infections already low community, wearing masks small (no, Americans, 15 people small gathering) private settings necessary. Again, times low community spread. saying, taking COVID seriously mask-wearing zero-sum games. 

That said, feel many people failed take COVID something seasonal disease heavy outbreaks much likely late fall/winter late/spring-summer, certainly messaging given US elsewhere West matter. people instructed prepare alter behavior late fall-winter, situation could different. Sleeping around? They‚Äôve hard work tweak formula realised efficacy would match what‚Äôs currently market (they announced today would restart trials), already help BioNTech J&amp;J that‚Äôs ¬´¬†sleeping around¬†¬ª ? Jesus tap dancing Christ... see officially ending pandemic vaccine distribution set countries. Global travel restrictions would also need remain place.

In terms domestic activity within US, things get back normal much sooner that. think lot states going make laws future public health restrictions ever enforced within next years. know Texas' Republican party already made part platform. We're locking stop COVID-19. COVID runs freely amongst young population increases likelihood new variant, perhaps even vaccine resistant one.  doesn‚Äôt really matter he‚Äôs decorated public servant credentialed specialist infectious disease. get point speak however want Personally think end April beginning May United Kingdom United States, better nothing date suppose. least normal Summer, that's looking right now, anyway. Spring 6 weeks away. time get everybody line...twice. Summer, much better.

His comments fall hedging. Nobody get caught optimistic wrong. Throughout whole time people shamed one said ""we'll vaccine spring..."" turns winter. people said ""hey, Easter sweet! pack churches!"" are. quoted passage also leaves part says mean full remote work masks everybody.  Maybe means restaurants 50% weeks remote work advised huge lecture hall classes moved online courses.

Vaccines stop getting really sick dying. That's bottom line. Saying virus spontaneously convert something dangerous cases plummeting bs. Notice variant talk quieted lot past couple weeks? Sure MSM still going bonkers actual doctors going ""yeaaah...not doomsday thought was."" vitiligo 

Interesting covid Feb 2020 belly chest. honestly thought got sunblock body tan well rest. vaccine protect 2009 H1N1 first became available, supplies limited. reason, CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended people highest risk complications virus, caring high risk individuals cannot receive vaccination, receive vaccine first. target groups included pregnant women, people live care children younger 6 months age, health care emergency medical services personnel, anyone 6 months 24 years age, people ages 25 64 years age higher risk 2009 H1N1 influenza certain chronic health conditions compromised immune systems. Maybe weren‚Äôt paying attention last year. hurdles, fear misinformation threatening leave city‚Äôs immigrant communities behind vaccine rollout ramps up. Mock news clips extremely easy make. anyone company owned apple product time last 10 years owns desk TV, make one basically zero extra cost. Heck, I‚Äôve written professional quality soundtrack music presentation videos work tools education so, like it.

Frankly, mean. You‚Äôre continuing spread Covid conspiracies, mindset led far deaths permanently altered lives necessary.

You don‚Äôt get spread crap around without called it. I‚Äôm kicking dead man‚Äîyou‚Äôre much alive, better said 2.5 million people thanks virus.

For countless others experiencing permanently damaged hearts lungs thanks virus, version ‚Äútaken everything worth living for‚Äù away.

Yes, lockdowns suck. hate too. also know they‚Äôre necessary. ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù even come close millions people experienced merit sort sympathy. Holy shit dude, would love live fairy tale world living in. maybe seem think Covid 100% death rate someone cancer, just.... close true, spreading misinformation like probably aided influenced people go cancer treatments, *absolutely going*. 

I hope anyone reading this, getting cancer treated much dangerous health possibility catch Covid getting cancer treated. 

Also, despite dire warnings, hospital capacity large remained well maximum occupancy. According HHS, maximum overall hospital usage Rhode Island 91% maximum ICU usage Alabama 96%. absolutely caused logistical issues led specific hospitals full, according data, overwhelming hospital systems greatly exaggerated cancellations ended needed hospitals remained full capacity. also, hospitals *laying workers* (which would expect exact opposite thing overwhelmed). leaders *thought* would run room due terrible projections government, caused cancel procedures, people die result. speaks nothing large number people hesitations even procedures done (think back large number ""missing"" heart attack patients - heart attack patients would *never* turned away hospital yet we've seen large reduction past year). Days 17-21 acceptable according sites I've looked at. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I live Vietnam China, I‚Äôm Asian American whatever. You‚Äôre definitely misrepresenting American western people. Also giving way much credit eastern culture. Idk Asian countries abundance problems, I‚Äôd pick western country day China Vietnam. hope cite proper sentences. Thats weird! almost like vaccines work! Thanks! Exactly needed. predict happen 18-25 year age groups clubs reopen? donate blood red cross typically show blood donation contained covid19 antibodies. Blood donations covid antibodies especially helpful. I‚Äôve long thought increases cases linked people‚Äôs interactions private environments: i.e. homes.  something difficult measure increase cases areas business shuttered, thing left people‚Äôs homes. experience living area Florida masks required, people generally, know exceptions, likely social distance, wear mask, etc. business home. Go restaurant friends everyone enters restaurant mask sits table. you‚Äôre home mask wearing, social distancing, people give hugs. possibility shuttering businesses may actually increase covid cases people still gonna people move party someone‚Äôs house instead. received doses per capita, also used greater percentage doses received every state except New Mexico, worthy praise. 


You said cut West Virginia's supply half see compare - well they'd probably still applauded distribution. There's reason Alaska celebrated much North Dakota West Virginia distribution vaccines actually quite poor doses per capita high disproportionate supply. 68 y/o man works small local grocery store rural NH cannot get vaccine til mid-May due appointments booked. Can‚Äôt something done this? Seems like real failure protect high risk exposure severe illness. I‚Äôm sad him. brings groceries car don‚Äôt go inside. want protected! stand corrected. That‚Äôs great idea combat antivaxxing ideas. depends many vaccine doses AstraZeneca actually deliver March second quarter. CureVac also mRNA vaccine. good reasons (including European Medicines Agency (EMA) starting rolling review CureVac vaccine) believe effective maybe even AstraZeneca Johnson Johnson vaccines. Wow it‚Äôs almost like science evolves understanding grows time. states virus like ""I'm going go diving too!"" B-but anglos keep saying ""take care first""!! means ***wrong***?

1. Cases continue plummet coming months especially summer vaccinations get rolled seasonality causes virus circulate less

2. Everything normal summer except restrictions large indoor events (concerts, conferences, indoor weddings, full capacity indoor sport crowds)

3. Fall / winter covid circulates cases increase Bc seasonal, people aren‚Äôt vaccinated risk, anyone gets sick gets sniffles / cold. Maybe vaccine booster shots variants, may necessary. mask wearing restrictions certain areas w outbreaks 

4.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think writes off. logical though come fall/winter going uneasiness. think that's avoidable. Basically we'll vaccinated lot questions durability come up. like car repair. REALLY know going work replace part think let rip. ""hold butts..."" moment.

Spring: Probably okay. think people fully expect hanging backyards, garages, probably even indoors. Restaurants probably 50% then.

Summer: jail break. full attendance baseball games recreational sports back, beaches, lot smaller downtowns probably hopping, traveling frowned upon...There plenty that's fun need strap mask.

Fall/Winter: anxiety rises ""its covid season"" Nonetheless schools back going guess much normal. Unless things totally goes haywire, holidays normal. People canceling ANOTHER holiday season told ""next Christmas better..."" going 2019 type normal except maybe wear mask flight home something. Big deal. Huge NYE parties probably happening mostly choice. Again, big deal. Get wasted home 10 closest.

Spring 2022: full-on back normal. Sold baseball stadiums. Sold NBA NHL playoffs. honest guess events jump ahead timeline late winter. fully expect College Football Playoffs sold out, full capacity, sans masks.

Obviously layman's view, think puts real world spin specifics article. literally said masks don‚Äôt work, said masks work, 10 months later said two masks commonplace Yeah read article no, ‚Äúanything‚Äù severe requiring hospitalization. Death heart tissue long term. It‚Äôs permanent. can‚Äôt handle reality must conspiracy Fauci? Yeah that's I've heard found good sources showcase. anything could look read on? Man, vaccine number pretty low according CDC... brutal winter still affecting vaccinations number complete today? FWIW, like either. live alone miss seeing people everyday.   can't fault Tories that, look like we're worst roadmap set actually seems well thought out. 

I'll never forgive actions leading however hope one else does. President one invoked DPA. President time refused so. Blame rather make good doctor punching bag. wonderful news! Hopefully happens elsewhere world, hopefully achieve herd immunity vaccinations sooner enough. Biden told plan defeat covid (he didn‚Äôt) seeing dwindling case numbers vaccine created help Trump admin. k, thanks replying anyways. sure? joking aside, isn‚Äôt far 2019. live Florida (south Florida specifically) know you‚Äôre ultra sarcastic original post, reality really isn‚Äôt far off. want something normally (with exceptions) it. Florida taken stance choice do/not stuff. Depending upon view point (of expressing view point one way other) people may feel right approach/wrong approach.

You certainly go restaurant watch band one many outdoor concerts. Naturally, going Arena seeing Beyonc√© isn‚Äôt going happen, favorite band local band normally local gigs limiting factor would band wanting play. 

You watch live sports want. PGA Tour, Daytona 500, MLB, NHL, NBA, college sports, etc. experience pretty damn close full crowds considering teams like Marlins 25% occupancy trended 23% occupancy 2019.

You full attendance class. You‚Äôd likely wear mask, dependent upon you‚Äôre one counties still mask ordinances.

The idea going somewhere criticized wearing/not wearing mask never return. 2084 advent mask wearers criticize sneezed due seasonal allergies aren‚Äôt wearing mask. 

Most people aren‚Äôt hesitant hang out. number times I‚Äôd see older folks hanging drinking coffee friends (before vaccine available) daily occurrence. mRNA vaccines stop spread. Multiple studies confirm.

The vaccines probably do, we're waiting data sure. it? published. saying data able see. What's methodology? Same, wild think about. wondering like dine restaurant long take little nervous it/back feeling normalcy again. getting food delivered I'm high risk never thought I'd excited go grocery store again. misrepresentation. Fauci said preserve masks medical workers. Let guess, support use HCQ? think user name really fits comments I've seen far. So, good job that. Fauci gaffs shit says really stings considering everything we‚Äôve thru last year, cold reality-based statements refreshing grounding, false hope isn‚Äôt game appreciate that.

While I‚Äôm sure countries underreporting numbers (Putin example), lack capacity throughly test keep consistently accurate records, numbers show US 20+ percent cases deaths entire pandemic, despite even 3% world‚Äôs population. incredible wealth country disposal, fact watched China Europe develop outbreaks nothing way late.  got covid 3 weeks ago still cough. it‚Äôs bad mornings nighttime it‚Äôs gone  No. said grandchild grand parent vaccinated, still shouldn‚Äôt see other. 

He‚Äôs hack. that‚Äôs insane.

Herd immunity happen well 2022. Masks another 1+ years, crazy.

We don‚Äôt need every single person vaccinated achieve herd immunity. never hit 0% transmission virus. formulate plan going back normal. 

What world makes think nobody thought go back normal people vaccinated/the virus circulating? That's great them, great people sit within 2 feet 4 hours time wait couple months get vaccinated. might older, still kidney disease. even lung damage previous pneumonia could high risk old people. Trump lied virus faces privately calling terrifying worse strenuous flus. 9/11 casualty daily normal time office, particularly toward latter end term. far, yes. YMMV course. No, unfortunately not, I've seen mainstream media references preprint studies, actual preprints. referring mock news clips, higher production value usual emergency scenarios? mean lockdowns taken everything worth living anyway kicking dead man. can‚Äôt wait fade background along rest nightmare. never? remember everyone stockpiling price gouging hand sanitizers, gloves cleaning supplies? Perhaps intelligent move circumstance preserve limited supplies first responders treating people suffering disease Perhaps. feeling Osterholm alarmist unnecessarily amplifying risk. claims new variants concern going significantly explode. Based purely scientific merit, reason doubt fact case. 

it could limelight, could people like gottlieb close ties industry think tanks wanting wish economy back strength. know Gottlieb constantly interviewed palace Connecticut. like he's kind beltway outsider. like swamp creature whose head way Margaret Brennan's know Cool, hope helps. consistency like vaseline lotion, really helps seal everything give hot minute heal. Hey, least winter's almost over. coming massive spike everyone traveling thanksgiving yet hit.

This comment aged like milk HAHAHAHAHA rules generally go everyone stated government. proud Britain good things, also hate things harm it. cause reduction infections lockdown reason. curve Sweden better uk continental Europe. person educated molecular biology still mentally sound would endorse antivax conspiracies good conscience. allegation orignal commentator antivax baseless.

stalled approval AZ scientifically justifiable reason. decision making bodies responsible exact opposite general public laypeople. shouldn‚Äôt swayed media headlines remarks made people vested interests little education, yet (and many others, qualified me) believe were. What's wrong normalizing masks we're sick? effective tool. Normalizing masks we're sick obviously silly. Refer angry users mentioned comment replying order gain insight happen links studies?

Thanks advance. Ya ur right :( still see city councils talking reopening things based entirely tier system. pressure newsom likely scrap it. False. 
The homeless vaccinated every state since January. forget ProfessorX. Wish right. USA could fine Pfizer rest world desperate need vaccine many vaccines come. I‚Äôm 19. Lost year college, second half senior year plus prom/graduation summer 2020 this. parents 50+ plus really don‚Äôt want covid hunkered house pretty much since March online college, fucking sucks. Add adhd top it‚Äôs hell earth plus lot mediocre grades. like others saying, we‚Äôve sacrificed *so much* get damn near nothing return. thought staying house abiding rules would maybe, maybe..help terms cases deaths. nope. People still died, cases still rises, lost crucial time social development virus honestly doesn‚Äôt even affect age group significantly. I‚Äôm thankful parents loved ones still alive entire ordeal, it‚Äôs long frustrating journey wonder many Palestinians get one passes... obviously live stats books opposed real life seeing eyes. Get basement go see yourself. ever NYC? Anyone half brain walked streets last 6 months knows I‚Äôm talking about. mean look US covid numbers compared Canada numbers (or rest world), trying save countries US would foolish arrogance. Yes trump vaccine full effect. sub useful first months, overrun bros angry masks, angry restrictions, angry journalists covering pandemic Fauci. become like Trump group Facebook. Yes, least 4 days ago. ones least affected last get vaccine. Sucks Yeah, read article.  username anything terrible tho. Lol Cheers ü§ó state remotely strict mask mandate serious enforcement kind. Plenty jackasses saying ""nah"" whole time. That's we're fucking mess. Enjoy. bet face choice going fired they'll get used pretty soon Look point possibility potential variants good reason divert vaccinations one country another. US obtained organized vaccinations citizens, countries done same. Maybe population fully vaccinated start helping others, lost hundreds thousands. time government help people. Canadian heard prime minister saying great government signing contracts vaccines. reality settling contracts great. USA went government denying virus fill vaccine roll out. Clearly disconnect statements prime minister reality. Unvaccinated individuals continue contract spread virus easily eliminated. Given transmission rates possible people refuse vaccines continue unnecessary drain healthcare system, putting risk others require medical aid can't receive hospitalizations due covid putting healthcare workers continued risk. know long vaccination effectiveness last. 

If person concerned individual rights pandemic response says alot selfishness continue future global emergencies. Ah that‚Äôs excellent news, light end tunnel getting brighter. Floor nurse yet vaccinated. Agreed completely. Staffing *already* issue. continuously short staffed staff self isolating replacements. Rapidly burning out. Mission accomplished!  getting downvotes?? didn‚Äôt say agree bar thing. 

I think stupid. 

I never said kids aren‚Äôt allowed sad. asked depressing. aren‚Äôt teaching kids anything terrible asking wear masks. You‚Äôre actually helping instill values selflessness wearing mask aren‚Äôt truly themselves, it‚Äôs help others around them.

But hey, you‚Äôve made mind what‚Äôs mind whatever. care virus doesn‚Äôt continue spread, help stop it. Wearing mask easiest thing done. That's insane, work hospital US, would probably given many shots get skipped delivery 2 weeks ago make lot assumptions reason. worth hope correct lockdowns ending Exactly. can‚Äôt believe anyone sees news anything terrible. Yeah honestly...I‚Äôve seen people talk missing highschool times part one extremely fond memories highschool lol mine pretty terrible...it‚Äôs really maintain discipline education required line. I‚Äôm also finishing masters right 8 years uni none great either...like said school that‚Äôs life gets good! none really work SA variant.

With regard J&amp;J (Janssen) vaccine:

""And South Africa, worrisome variant predominant strain, effectiveness fell 57 percent."" effective South African variant horrible. Everyone Reddit shits America. seem overly obsessed Canada yourself. Thank you! Obviously want reiterate many people experiencing worse pain due pandemic, it‚Äôs much sacrifice grand scheme thing help everyone stay safer. yeah easy look negatively things, comment helps makes excited comes after! hard compare since getting tested almost impossible unless either someone family requires hospitalization. understanding correct. People understand herd immunity means pandemic over. mean covid disappears. Hahaha FOUR EYES

former glasses wearer rate might family go back to. ban vaccine exports sure helps. Europe would ban export vaccines would lot available too. Biontech/Pfizer vaccine doses Israel, Japan, arab countries etc using produced EU. Alright might dumb shouldn‚Äôt comparison per capita raw numbers? feel like it‚Äôs fair comparison. 

I felt way New Zealand. Like amazing job US could‚Äôve done much better, time NZ amount people 1 small US states. 

Just don‚Äôt like unfair comparisons. majority country autistic? /s really needed learn welding technical knowledge. touching eyes? Highly unlikely. virus live things well.

From respiratory droplets hitting eyes? Possibly, ophthalmic community seen much.

Also, FTP Sorry man, I'll never forgive people taking away year mid 20s, imagine able experience things. type job have? think get position phase 3 vaccination (when everyone get one) need start lifting restrictions go back normal. hold breath move goal posts Goals great ever seen successful execution? That's good stuff. Someone better tell Osterholm That‚Äôs awful lot doom gloom you‚Äôre posting  intending entire world thing time. reason italy didnt shit bc tht opened summer invited people in. shut actually working. Whst didnt work places thing. think father-in-law‚Äôs case, can‚Äôt deal potentially painful feelings people suffering, puts happy place saying ‚Äúpeople resilient‚Äù blah blah blah. doesn‚Äôt see invalidating people. He‚Äôs still good person, really bad providing emotional support challenging times. parents sound like might similar. 

I also think there‚Äôs huge mind-fuck comes public health messaging long period time. talking fully vaccinated boomers last weekend (who otherwise high risk) asked they‚Äôd travel visit kids summer (who also fully vaccinated, high risk). live within driving distance even camper they‚Äôd use lodging. said no, think it‚Äôs risky. wonder they‚Äôll change minds see people going live lives weather gets warmer cases presumably go down. Hopefully you‚Äôll either find way early vaccine, parents chill little let live life least summer. Maybe American Academy Pediatrics start ‚ÄúLet Teenagers Leave House‚Äù campaign something. stupid. Kids ‚Äúlearning robots‚Äù potted plants simply water grow. equivalent watering plants Brawndo. hardly make difference. mistake. said among experts. find people internet saying anything course.  people like Muffles get Trump done couple (lazy) things pandemic 2020? Golfing, ""shouldn't"" afraid virus, cheerleader reopening America, etc.? Comparing Atlanta disingenuous given gulf Atlanta‚Äôs population (&lt;500k) metro Atlanta population million). read much these. Ocular spread seem significant mode transportation. would expect see great amount conjunctivitis (pink eye) case.

With mind, I'm ophthalmologist seen literally two cases pink eye last calendar year (out 7000-8000 office visits), FAR normal amount. fucked sold manufacturing countries. short sided govt allowed purchases Friendship ended Fauci. Gottlieb best friend. Ebola 50% Fatality Rate

H5N1 (Avian Flu) 60% fatality rate

Hantavirus 36% Fatality Rate

SARS 9.6% Fatality Rate

There literally thousands viruses, undiscovered. Pretending none could become pandemic beyond stupid. Well similar problem Janssen, actually quoted efficacy ""moderate severe"" covid, others measured mild covid too. 

The Janssen (J&amp;J) also stunningly good phase III trial result USA ZERO deaths participants study it. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Got first dose today. second-rate? Yes. matter rethorical efforts articles like politicians make hide it, fact Pfizer/BioNTech reduces risk ~95%, i.e. 20 times, one ~66%, i.e. 3 times. difference individual risk huge (close order magnitude). that's ""second-rate"" definition, know is.

I guess pushes Sputnik Sinovac ""third rate"" definition. Canada secured many doses early schedule reasonable time seems increases supply gone elsewhere.

Correct I'm wrong, Canada ordered 6 million doses mRNA vaccines (4 mil Pfizer 2 mil Moderna) delivered March 31st? Canada received 1.85 million vaccines production ramps up. unreasonable?   Won‚Äôt share yet. We‚Äôve got pretty serious problem here. I‚Äôm sure numbers control start shipping bananas though. Almost anything considered essential right circumstances - simply cannot expect country totally prepared possible outcome world times. It‚Äôs exercise paranoia.

I laugh disgusting, make clear. Stay locked house, room restaurant me! Ironic though article results Scotland pretty much hate Uk government lol. comparison, US death toll Spanish Flu around 675,000.

Age far biggest factor determining mortality rates; give vaccine elderly far less people die. Great work Connecticut, let's hope backlash stop right thing. lot insight shown prevent severe covid also reduce transmission

You claim read published research think **shown**? Data **indicated** **may** substantial impact.

From important question whether vaccines provide impact transmission, therefore combined physical distancing measures contribute reductions human human transmission virus. **transmission studies per se included analysis,** swabs obtained volunteers every week UK study, regardless symptoms, allow assessment overall impact vaccine risk infection thus surrogate potential onward transmission. impact vaccine asymptomatic infection, would expected efficacious vaccine would simply convert severe cases mild cases mild cases asymptomatic, overall PCR positivity unchanged. **A measure overall PCR positivity appropriate assess whether reduction burden infection**. Analyses presented show single standard dose vaccine reduced PCR positivity 67%, that, second dose, SD/SD schedule reduced PCR positivity 49.5% overall. data **indicate** ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, used authorised schedules, **may substantial impact transmission reducing number infected individuals population.**  Due Super Bowl parties? new sub. God sub loves shit AZ vaccine. Like bullishit German newspaper claiming 8% efficient everyone jumped bandwagon must true lie. Numerous times people sub saying take it. Hell there's even people Germany refusing damn vaccine favour pfizer. Vaccine snobbery kicked country talking about? Depends. UK variant really transmissible scientists think might another bump infections race vaccinate U.S. foregone conclusion, possible. another bump likely much much smaller winter one. 

Countries slow get vaccines arms likely experience surges. ""I fucking told you!"" - ""OH GOD, WHY!?"". Add pile climate change everything else, guess. guttural level, wanna say we're done. tipping point back there, somewhere twent-teens. intellectual level, whatever, we'll probably fine. We're resilient, like cockroaches. positive note, I‚Äôve seeing reports - anecdotally - people autoimmune diseases feel better overall receiving vaccine. long-haul covid symptoms certainly overlap autoimmune diseases. can‚Äôt postulate reasons watch info, true. India shipping decent (considering time), diverse amount SE Asia, Africa, UN initiatives etc. look around threads here.

Given India fairly large population, increase domestic demand unexpected. WASHINGTON-- Drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson says able provide 20 million U.S. doses single-shot COVID-19 vaccine end March, assuming gets greenlight federal people going see vindication Brexit unfortunately Member ol'Biden went invoked Defense Production Act sure government using tools hand ramp dose production?

I do. think one treatment would unlikely. seems like multitude symptoms long haulers can‚Äôt really treat like identical prescribe one treatment. Yeah. That's good. Never said wasn't. 500k still lot deaths many could prevented Thank you! mean, theoretically get better vaccine next year anyway? 

Of course, tested like everything else, stacking vaccine typically issue. read news? Deaths dropping every week. thanks. effective Pf. bad ‚Äúcrap‚Äù vaccine. also think tracking age simplest method knowing move onto next group. States know many people certain age groups know move onto next. Would much harder figure based occupations conditions worst never happened.

Which true. groups modeling consistently coming scenarios many times worse what's actually happened. Even best/most likely/worst spread likely significantly worse happens.  get maybe slightly overstating things early get people take seriously unknowns much time really looking like crying get uncontrolled spread

And there's difference ""masks stupid I'm wearing one"" "" I'm getting really sick wear one hear people talk might become permanent everyday norm"" . first anti mask second normal human. likely August, later enough people get vaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* quite case, far spread goes targeting whatsoever, risk death. one 70 seeing second shots (outside doctors ,front line medical workers, severely risk) June.

Completely false inconsistent palnned vaccinations vaccine trajectory 6,835,866 seniors aged 65 older Canada July 1 2020.

Doctors number around 91,000. Nurses number around 431,000

Combining doctors, nurses, elderly. looking 7,357,866.

Canadian government claims 26 million vaccinated june. puts vaccination numbers Canada late April late may somewhere roughly around 18 20 million. enough tiny little pockets infection surrounded neutralized.

Numbers dont lie. Aprial/May Canada beaten thing without achieving full vaccination. milestones important people. Others much. seem chip shoulder perception others, rather recognizing people hold different things different valuations. people value education whole package (social experiences well education itself). like don't. diminish experiences others, hold different worldview, little myopic. mean... you. Obviously anyway. think yourself, anyone else, favors shaming others feel. right feelings perspectives. others. hope find peace. hate people say pfizer/moderna effected South African variant all. Like we've lab studies done show likely still works. actual trials ti show exactly efficiency offers. honestly can't blame pfizer/moderna wanting publish data. We've seen people overreact like suggesting ""dump vaccine immediately"" saw South African trial results even though variant widespread UK South Africa. see people overreacting refusing pfizer/moderna came reduced efficiency. 

Interesting point J&amp;J realised measured moderate severe symptoms whereas AZ measured mild moderate symptoms. make wonder J&amp;J results count mild cases well like worse then.

I still think mRNA vaccines vastly superior that's easy adjust compared vaccines like Moderna made 2 days quite frankly amazing grest fir future vaccine developments Yeah one first things thought pandemic started. imagined germaphobes would rapidly alternating horror vindication. honestly get people thought wouldn't.

(Ok, get can't say without proof, always likely scenario. Tend agree article.is bit ""thin"".

Given COVID relatively new disease, understand hard provide proof long term effects.

I would appreciated bit data even solid quotes respected infectious disease specialists neuroscientists though. that's case enough put swab little bit it? virues basically everywhere enough beginning nostril area. avoid contamination sample.
And mean tend multiple.  pandemics do? burn out? kind pseudo medical concept that? Pandemics get control lock down, wear masks, vaccinate. isn‚Äôt sudden decline virus got bored decided move on. Fauci advocating real shutdown. right politicians ones power many listened Fauci would said needed total lockdown think many would listened. talked people world United States' response terrible. Shutting initially would even better economy dragging like this. COVID likely become endemic failed control it. Even get entire USA vaccinated year still trouble 7 billion people world take decade get vaccinated covid continue spread evolve time period. making nationalist argument trying hide moral argument. sub, gut-feeling comparison sweden norway, finland denmark fair comparison.

Yes, coronavirus may cause long term issues, like virtually illness virus. coronavirus unique way. Yeah strange situation I'm quite surprised far behind rest Europe is. Israeli military occupied West Bank last half-century, effectively serves authority there, region population nearly 3 million Palestinians. Israel promotes defends 100s illegal internationally sanctioned Israeli settlements within borders West Bank. Gaza Strip slightly autonomy terms governance foreign policy still set Israeli state gunpoint. Sorry original bad answer, think linked article gives incorrect picture situation Sweden. Sweden much less unique parts international media tries tell. Sweden rather unsuccessful, approach different countries. much covid deaths Nordic neighbours, less European countries. Sweden seems conservative things stuck longer countries agreed-upon practices pandemic, using masks general public. agreed-upon practices proven bad, Sweden slower many countries changing course. bad. big, planned push towards herd immunity here. true theoreticians early Sweden, elsewhere, thought almost countries would end herd immunity summer. obviously wrong. Congratulations! You‚Äôre element trying tie mobility cases. The, assume, IHME data you‚Äôre showing actually showing decreased mobility last 5 months.

Also, one jab Pfizer supposed give 93% protection much higher rate sterilising immunity (meaning can't transmit) previously thought.

I'm sure would considered one.

I experience ton anxiety wearing masks. I'm sure what's wrong me, I've broken crying masks many times. cannot enjoy activity I'm wearing mask. cause much stress discomfort.

I've worn mask far every business requires one. I'm shy nonconfrontational hate causing scene making trouble workers. 

But live they're required literally everywhere. Even walking alone outside covid risk 0. refuse wear go daily exercise walk outside. I've gotten tons judgemental looks gotten snapped times, won't. I'm endangering anyone walking outside mental health shit is. 

I also refuse wear house people come hang out. warn ahead time, I've gotten several arguments friends it. far I'm concerned, worried wearing one come over. (If someone come asks wear one, it.)

My first thought people wear glasses able afford them, means may likely health benefits, therefore likely cushy jobs, therefore likely work home yadda yadda. Yeah, data came Lancet confirmed Russians saying Sputnik.

It's great vaccine. Beats Coronavirus! Russia done great job there. Feels silly world buying (unless local production something).

India manufactures huge amount pharmaceuticals, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre getting something random country experience area.

Distance learning really sucks No. said vaccines mean people get them. example used Indianapolis vaccines thrown away person scheduled receive showing appointment. pertains front-line medical workers everybody else. 

I posted link said ""here information vaccine shelf-life"" indicate article vaccine shelf-life. 

They can't hold onto thawed vaccines. people use refuse them, limited amount time still usable.

The article intended prove anything 'the vaccine used shelf life x days"". 

Hope helps understanding. weather warmer. fact, colder. island also. Every success story almost always island. SA variant still limited prevelance UK countries. exists take become one main variants (if even become one main variants, would likely need advantage UK variant become dominant strain England). 

Uk might data eventually right think there's way cases make statistically significant claims. best bet studies carried SA start show data reach statistically significant results relation severe disease death Again, they're perfect. imply activities banned give us pleasure disingenuous. I'm agreeing them. said vaccines altered based new mutations necessary need produce ground up.

Examples idiocy:

Germany time certainly late(more one month) lockdown.

In Germany churches still working. overcrowded offices facilities. Nobody cares.

This time nobody cares nursing home - tests, control, nothing. constant COVID-19 outbreaks here, skyrocketing death curve lockdown extension. risk death tiny 50. hospitalization risk significant. restrictions put place little effect numbers long-term.

I, young person who's fucking sick pandemic, fully support vaccinating strictly based age supply low end pandemic restrictions quicker. Depends upon point view.. opposite Trump's philosophy. Over-promise find way screw end, blame someone else. vaccine developed specifically US Mexico.

They 1.3 billion doses pre-ordered probably many come.

The whole point article insufficient trials show AZ vaccine effectively prevent spread people getting seriously ill population level, author recommending Australia prioritizes proven vaccine anti-COVID strategy. wrong you?

Could ask you. Places open whole time similar drop places locked much legally possible. 

Vaccine roll happening, cases dropping level nobody thought possible, people suffering.

Open up. it. Well 4 years Americans getting disappointed US related news. numbers great, expect Pzifer's jab less effective two. fair, way back July stated worst virus would January. one transparent, open honest statement made someone trying hid obvious respiratory virus going spread matter what.

I would imagine lessons learned pandemic. Hopefully every country figures better plan future. pandemic substantially worse, would see even larger disparities nots. yet today's, real world data UK shows effective Pfizer cheaper. UK lockdown reduced infections 1/6th hospital admissions 1/4.

How much would need consider effective? make half million plus excess deaths? see anything like countries virtually zero COVID deaths.

Demographics fragile group (e.g. ""people likely die next infection"") requires knowing many died last year. know Sweden mild flu season, suppose also unlikely much different neighboring countries.

As elderly care, Sweden Norway (for example) like different planets.

Sanofi plans deliver 120m vaccines Europe summer. know what's going happen I'm media telling going happen.

Fauci understand says affects people policy. apparently obvious negative consequences continued lockdowns. Maybe learn English then? official language thus country all. anyone really expect call center employee going speak Chinese? trying say ‚Äúit‚Äôs like 4000 people really look it‚Äù say it‚Äôs 500,000 see parameters used naive. assumed/hoped along. mean though? can't see much changing vaccinated vs. not. Even supply ramps anyone wants get inoculated gets it. 

We remember - people stupid. vaccinated allowed go maskless hell break loose. Where's science? Lock downs literally invented 14 year old girl, China first country implement them...and never worked slow COVID spread. soon open, still there. COVID go away people stayed home. I'm talking AZ losing money. Obviously cover costs, make money post pandemic.

But pharmaceutical industry whole, one successful widely distributed vaccines sold cost leaves awful lot money table. 

You see would drive within industry push people take vaccine healthy profit margin. preferred scenario? area previously hit hard higher immunity pct. dose given greater chance redundant going waste. course, 100% posturing without substance. get wrong, think need send lot vaccines countries might able pay them, French saying ""charit√© bien ordonn√©e commence par soi-m√™me"" (well ordered charity starts oneself) - can't take good care people getting affairs order. 1. course was. See didn‚Äôt lie. said masks reserved medical personnel due stockpiling (see above) masks, hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies ethical decision. obviously know recovering addicts. rely fellowship routine meetings maintain healthy lifestyle. 

Source : Alcoholic addict sober 5 years. Sponsor many others. See lot people relapse end awful situations due lack connection. According projections things go well half adults vaccinated end June/early July.

Assuming goes well ofc. Shut up. lot us one would listen. Public health used ethics, benefits, harms. one looking harms. COVID COVID shup stay home nothing else matters Oh okay I‚Äôm happy America they‚Äôre people, also people US get shots, trickle countries.

Especially moderna, since, afaik, haven‚Äôt made contracts vaccine US, right?  are. actually read it? one NATURE, considered foremost scientific Id like share optimism really dont want uk strain spread. read one doubling usa even lockdown, overall numbers good may false hope. hope keep restricted state longer normal one really aggressive.

2. Fauci learn ethical politics felt need lie constituents order relay message. wrong, backpedaled. Yea live Astoria neighborhood pretty great actually. Don‚Äôt talk this! 

I commented Canadian sub backlash typical ‚Äú good Trump bad!‚Äù 
It‚Äôs us vs left vs right. Trudeau bungled vaccine roll Americans got right. Trudeau that, won‚Äôt. No. amplified conditions. Surely many addicts alcoholics able break away bad peer groups influences? Would imply helped? can't find article it, rolling average daily deaths forty percent since Valentine's day. dropped forty percent one week. That's obviously mirroring dramatic case drop we've seeing six weeks now, continue mirroring decline, we'd outstanding position. definitely got dumbass

Dude definitely did. fucking busted. actual statistics article. criticism op eds.

Listen man, going argue you. hope continue pretend people suffered government response virus. bigger virus. tone deaf response. token, say 9/11 didn‚Äôt matter people die everyday? We‚Äôll see suppose. J&amp;J‚Äôs supply chain little weak counter, alongside AZ, Novavax running SII India they‚Äôve nothing short phenomenal far. 

Ontario expects 160,000 inoculations day Q2, they‚Äôve also claimed could higher pharmacy/GP participation. rate averaged nationally, comes 420,000 doses/day, would take 4 months inoculate 24.5M people doses. We‚Äôll see much higher take (at 490K/day would take 3 months so) signals wide availability Canadians happen Q2. That‚Äôs reassuring sign me. Lmaoooo comments praising previous admin get removed, comments praising current admin get removed?

I guess one ""purely political.""

Fuck sub entire site. multiple countries people weeks mostly normal year thereafter. not. Fauci wanted first responders people dealing sick patients access masks. stockpiled price gouged. 7700 Americans die every day 10800 Americans born every day. Death inevitable people die born every day. wanna hide away cower risks inherent day day life guest dont force coward California 33rd deaths per million amongst states, good, really struggled winter. simple Covid fatigue lower participation social distancing? Tough early location variants would assume. Leggoo ü§òüèª There‚Äôs big difference saying masks could possibly remain place then, thinking means should. Hopefully covaxin effective.   Fauci promoted anti mask mentality told people ineffective initially. told 2 days 2 days fine, got mine 23 days didnt sooner appointments reason ""The popular Southern supermarket chain said offering employees $125 gift cards sign show proof vaccination."" hell Justin Trudeau doing??   Now, US sounds like country advanced medical technology world. blew mind US got shitstorm COVID-19 first US really best medical technology country much money. Profit. reason job. bet could productive work pay doubled. Ah yes, old 99% argument.

Covid lethal 1% cases. western population it‚Äôs closer 0.3%. Half long term care. means rest us 0.15%. age ranges thus represents slight increase expected mortality.

Germany buy doses tied EU supplies? sub hasn‚Äôt pro lockdown since Pfizer applied emergency use.

You think addicts, alcoholics, domestic abuse victims, homeless manic depressives suffering lockdowns amplified conditions? really willing deny damage done? idea. It‚Äôs valid. vaccine prevent spreading covid. It‚Äôs literally CDC website continue wearing masks distancing even doses. Right? current admin charge 4 1/2 weeks.

Despite anyone feels it, previous administration big reason success. Covid may much thing, SARS-nCoV-2 almost certainly stay. offense seems like problem Canada brought something blamed America. see much testing we're doing... Biomedical Engineering. zero biomedical engineering jobs Ontario.

I friend works biotech McMaster, PhD, so, yeah, took hell long time get there. 

The government criminally invested research commercialization said research Canada.  Jinkies! No, Trump said ‚Äúthe coronavirus far worse strenuous flus‚Äù 

The collateral damage non existent.

What worried mRNA vaccines particular? We‚Äôve given tens millions people already, we‚Äôve trialing half decade. Moderna dosed people bird flu vaccine 2014. mRNA-1440 H10N8. main headline every Covid newsfeed Fauci, again, saying thing going last 2022, even things improve summer.

It's major story Fauci *keeps saying* we're going need masks 2022 fucking rate we're going (and vaccines hold, and, and, and, huge bummer WH Fauci going way say it, frankly). 

It's infuriating. Fauci says something nice sounding, goes. fairly crucial bit new information (they started line last week, gotta wonder projections saying internally, what's different, yeah? Can't even know question). 

Oh well, read airline booking numbers highest level since holidays. 

But know, let's keep talking shit past tense, yeah?  right, life back normal Palestinians. zero backing claim. think people losing people close enough reason decline mental health?

But ‚Äújust another year‚Äù. incredibly disruptive, mentally emotionally taxing everybody. countries Africa? Please specific (ie Ethiopia small wave month - it‚Äôs still winter season).

Nobody gave shit college experience worthless except job training. contrary Reddit thinks, no, I‚Äôm taking added isolation well. can‚Äôt even really try make friends meaningful way. Meanwhile, see Instagram people cliques years still partying mask chin.

Anyway, wasn‚Äôt sure going this, guess it‚Äôs mildly infuriating seeing people good social lives pandemic good socials lives pandemic complain lost year know full well it‚Äôs uphill battle even pandemic yet still want meantime help public safety. irrevocably shown decreased spread virus growing exponentially. government would say ""you can't x unvaccinated people establishment.""  Well gov Cuomo aid said fluffed numbers ny. know what's frustrating. one 85 able get vaccine states elderly check local grocery drug store websites see appointments. LAST 4 WEEKS!


and asshole canuck got vaccinated (paid US tax dollars).

Why fuck health 20 year old aliens visa holders getting vaccinated risk elderly.

Fuck scheduling vaccine waiting. care cop nurse, already got exposed risk death get infected. insane fast tracking 20 year old canadians. Amazing others could. Maybe magic? No, doesn‚Äôt. New York much densely populated. Viruses spread faster high density populations. It‚Äôs much easier Florida avoid people New York. Therefore it‚Äôs much important measures place New York vs Florida. Here's hoping Wasn‚Äôt issue Florida reporting deaths cases? effect someone resigned result? mean science uniformly supports use measures unless better means verify things arises that‚Äôs say think likely would anti-vaccers. people would Novaxx Djokovic fans, previously made public statements vaccines kind. someone wants sure. people sub want mask mandates like November March oh i'm glad see people's faces right now, see mine. love privacy human right go movie theater. damn snow. article could published month ago headline Trump still president would true too. US vaccinated people Trump's last day office Canada total day. also still many thing outside us north aren‚Äôt able move outdoors February. sweat here. people going college experience, 90% isolation. pandemic excuse then, depression/anxiety/WoW addiction crippling inability socially interact. 

That's gone now, brutal times. vaccinated fast possible. going never-ending storm epidemics. virus mutates enough completely evade vaccine stop able infect human cells. So, current vaccines essentially always offer least level protection, especially severe disease. 

The worst case scenario virus sticks around circulates population causing much deaths / hospitalizations year flu, need annual booster shots (like flu). Even really bad outcome. live flu fine. Canada basically sabotaged vaccine production facilities decades ago, making entirely dependent foreign vaccine imports. delayed purchasing vaccines busy patting back superior handling pandemic ended superior all. Tarrant county (where Fort Worth in) vaccinated roughly amount people b.c has. Even though b.c twice amount people. I‚Äôll gladly wait turn Ahhh, see. Thanks! I‚Äôll honest. legit can‚Äôt tell difference cold normal allergies impact days week. swear people sub think masking rest life think *might* sick Probably letting vaccinated people around community spread way down. domestic regulators approved one vaccine far, nation remains dependent imported supplies held production snags export controls. Since Kono, minister administrative reform, tapped last month lead Japan‚Äôs vaccination push, resisted giving firm timelines doses arrive distributed. Japan negotiated receive 144 million doses Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine year, second shipment 450,000 shots arrived Sunday. Hanging zoom pretty garbage Florida basically back normal since August whereas CA still heavily restricted. Florida ~1350 deaths per million compared CA's ~1250. They're also towards top vaccinations CA bottom. Let's even get stared New York...

I know look say DeSantis piss poor job. prove it? ~~Maybe not.~~

Pretty sure leaning fact neither trusted. really crazy everything fault Probably gets flu levels deaths would say. another couple months automod want leaving comments overtly political assure entire portions US feel way actively judge masking.  much higher population though? hypothesis? COVID highly contagious?

Just cases dropping mean open game open things without caution. That's thing spreads gets hand. relax restrictions, people start mingle before, got cases rising rapidly people careful along. That's needs investment preventing pandemics like this, people continue live normal quickly possible potential pandemics identified. Well, completely unexpected. single confirmed case

&amp;#x200B;

Not hard falsify No. vaccine contain actual virus, it‚Äôs impossible vaccinated person spread unless caught disease spite vaccinated. gotta weather related, winter storms fucking everything. Masks taken almost religious status some. guess one thing people thought could protect invisible enemy latched onto it. It‚Äôs gonna hard habit break some.  absolutely explains higher death number overall. similar average numbers daily deaths now, February. similar new cases well, positive test rates similar. biggest difference two states New York, February 2021, much serious restrictions Florida February 2021. similar numbers new cases deaths. I'm saying makes restrictions useless, obviously help slow transmission, least make question objectively useful are? sure hope so. surprised see sort bounce late March April. also thing bounce would mostly meaningless could happen worry people. 

After hoping things ready winter, think people worried again. Hey wanted say fucking sucks would‚Äôve devastated time too. don‚Äôt go thinking best time life. I‚Äôve WAY fun post college actually money things want don‚Äôt worry fucking tests shit Texas also huge state. wonder numbers metropolitan areas compared rest. wrong.. could published story, headline, month ago Trump still president would true too. US vaccinated people Trump's last day office (just one day) Canada vaccinated far total. literally eliminate strains flu time. Example, Hong Kong flu H2N2 haven‚Äôt seen strain H2N2 since H3N2 supplanted it. We‚Äôre talking wiping Coronaviruses really (which would closest could get you‚Äôre talking eliminating ‚ÄúThe Flu‚Äù). We‚Äôve eliminated SARS1 MERS likely eliminated shortly, don‚Äôt really see COVID special considering it‚Äôs burn rate population. doesn‚Äôt super long latent period, quick mutations, rapid recombination common farm animals like difficult eliminate diseases have. easier eliminate Polio. get kn-95 mask. nose clip solves problem. Similar logic applied earth starts dying climate change. since it‚Äôs India curious. India really interesting place places full-on 21st century state art places others don‚Äôt even indoor plumbing

i wonder glasses wearers india likely access care that‚Äôs difference average person shouldn‚Äôt feel awkward wearing mask. now, less used it, kinda like holding things keys pocket. Without keys, you‚Äôd feel awkward. SSRIgang It‚Äôs pretty reasonable say Newsom DeSantis done piss poor job. Accurate too. selfish prick cure. right emergency situation. Germans still freaking residual radiation Chernobyl. don‚Äôt forget $2000 3 day hotel costs return home loved ones IDK, lost glasses time almost year lasik :P.

If know adjust imaginary glasses search months needing them. gosh friend maybe opine sick people making light lives lost? trust Florida's numbers  far know, state gets determine method vaccinating residents, even though federal government providing guidelines. 

There's really reason I'd expect Texas different otherwise, they're substantially farther along vaccination progress California (they're actually behind, percentage wise) amount vaccinations going out, surprised summer normal. Even there's news yet, seems pretty obvious. I‚Äôm old I‚Äôm also young guys. sucks matter what. people saying year isn‚Äôt long people absolutely nothing life. Japan enough vaccines June vaccinate whole population. It'll huge struggle get country anti-vaccine Japan herd immunized see lot people complaining lack vaccinations countries well procurement fully vaccinated 2021, way better third world. Oh fuck 500 inches snow ground, would. know that's impossible IL right :) Please explain. Yea parents fully vaxed lot stress mind Nothing would change matter President. Fauci needs retire. Glad finally hear great new zelanders bragging. wait little city sized island bragging soon. states decide roll vaccine I'm sure exactly DOJ going here?

Also, Florida great job getting vaccines people fuck cares?

Maybe adopt CA strategy there's tons vaccines sitting freezers much bureaucracy distribution. Maybe would make Charlie Crist happy. can‚Äôt tell, good us, bad Canada, both? anyone know booing?

Are mad rest world also get back normal, Australia longer special? view added insult vaccines many Australians eagerly await foreign vaccine, efforts fallen short? would exactly see another chance act smug mock us. You‚Äôre going wait turn, Canada. I'm hoping that's contact tracing real thing.  asked sister, nurse, going tell boys (2 5) wearing masks normal thing something specific reason certain time lives. said absolutely. hope memory life awful time comes back pretty quickly students return normal. normal. guys almost completely vaccinated October, yall smart enough build factory. way better countries tbh. got energy cry louder everyone suffering. New York absolute epicenter virus United States. uncontrollable spread, treatment options, early research ventilators mistaken far more. Comparing Florida dishonest. 

Saving potentially millions lives deadly disease grew exponentially doubt proves benefits stay home orders, masks, social distancing. read preponderance research effect. majored biology undergrad flair, read seen contract, private side government procurement suspect Canadian contract poorly negotiated. doses come end quarter, stretched timeline. Ok much think individual people paying vaccine addition government paying them? ... that's horrifying. 

I'm originally US now, I've heard family envy. Canada really well social measures, vaccination program let down. Back States, mom works VA hospital, administration. limited contact patients, mostly works office. got second dose 6 weeks ago. Trumpandemic killed half million Americans, maybe want stop pushing pro trump false talking points ranger? Get self respect man think many people mind wearing mask indoors places know people vaccinated think reading sub.

I want wear one outside. Definitely. friends decided time exist show whenever. Everybody knew 

Fuck off. nine month old. pediatrician said long caretakers vaccinated community spread low enough, treat like treat diseases childhood (measles, chicken pox, etc). So, we‚Äôll going back normal. said, I‚Äôm stay home mom, baby won‚Äôt going daycare. America bad. Canada good. 

Lol love seeing smugness shoved face. ‚ÄúIf large segments population say, ‚ÄòOh I‚Äôm gonna get vaccinated now,‚Äô well could see ongoing transmission would make challenging get back new normal,‚Äù Osterholm said.

I disagree one.

If everyone wants get vaccinated turn, matter many others want get vaccinated. nobody left want get back normal. may still transmission deaths, still go back normal, simply virtually everyone want that. Aiming 1 billion USA alone!! depends employment state. example, Oregon vaccinating teachers addition medical workers people 70. Right.
But describe works non-scientific person sounds like treatment vaccine. know vaccines still transmit virus most. Messaging counts feel like Theraflu. Helpful vaccine traditional sense. non-scientific traditional sense. Damn that‚Äôs lockdown like USA. Lol. Lmao remember told us trash health care joke. Well still got jab boi OMFG come people. even hardest thing deal especially technology today. Imagine going 80s try get grip. lol turned 24 last year. instead moving favourite city attend amazing grad school, i‚Äôm trapped back homophobic, abusive family means escape. friends lost person knew area painful manner last summer.

i ‚Äúattend‚Äù useless, awful zoom grad school motivation, thing keeping going prospect moving summer in-person school fall. another year i‚Äôll either drop kill myself. i‚Äôm end tether there‚Äôs nothing wait. feel like pandemic taught bit - still growing, ways. always mild asthma since kid. Never bothered got something respiratory compounded. Usually little albuterol sick helped, sometimes needed long term control med (advair) - sick.

I got sick mid-March last year New York. First week fever 0.2F short abroad recently, second week tests used hospital admissions determine care. sick two weeks took work week half that. Serology test available 6 weeks onset course negative. 

Ever since I've long term medications control asthma daily (and went lowest dose albuterol highest illness) . require albuterol whenever sick, times healthy now.

I'm thankful require hospitalization worse afflictions, wonder I'm suffering long COVID. lack testing got sick, can't sure. youre comepletely missing point. people refer young adults mean age category 18-27. Missing life time experiences. youre 36 youre adult, young adult. giving sort sob story badass youre childhood wasnt optimal makes seem like r/iamverybadass material West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River know plenty people age younger effects. fact don‚Äôt stats yet let us know sure. know possibility exists studies underway. antidotal evidence supports nothing biases. 

Do know long connection chicken pox shingles understood? Interesting. remember Gottlieb saying immunity infected people months ago. Oh boy go grocery store. guess 99% things I'd want public closed nbd then. Protection claims 50-82% protection first Pfizer dose. Even low end good. Wear n95/kn95 follow precautions risk even lower. 

Hotel rooms appear major vector spread (as covid settles air 2-3 hours). Limit time lobby ok. *The study looked health records 5.4m people Scotland, equivalent 99 per cent population country. 1.14m people vaccinated December 8 February 15. majority age 75 received Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, larger proportion younger cohorts received BioNTech/Pfizer jab.*¬† 

Source: surprising. thought would given Pfizer jab risk groups. 

My brother-in-law doctor received Pfizer jab. I'm vulnerable disease, received AstraZenica jab. Jake Tapper Fax bro dude probably likes lockdown  WV first several things... finally good one. Bigger sample size always better, sometimes somewhat redundant problem term ""lockdown"" alone badly defined. 

Exactly! Americans think they're ""lockdown"" right absolutely ludicrous. term ""shutdown"" fits much better many businesses institutions shut result mitigation measures; places like South Korea Singapore something similar quite effective, especially Singapore shutdown measures continued lockdown ended. point, stop listening.

That's I'm summer, I'm 30, I'll vaccinated, masks stores I'm fucking done. Imagine Jake Tapper asking Fauci CNN fun college

*cries online college* weather related last week half. 

I would expect rebound starting week new supply increases 2.0-2.5 million day possible coming weeks. following recommendations means everyone else stay quarantine longer whole shit show keeps going. 

If locked world 6 weeks February 2020 would back pretty much normal now. would starved virus new people infect would done. 

But instead people selfish. UK bad, EU good! Hur dur! though? looking malaria cancer deaths per year, shifting reference frame either, right? Instead see excess mortality beginning 2021, compared 2015-2019, better: 2016-2020. European countries put much effort actually dealing virus instead spin, imagine well would handled it. said conduct EU disgraceful.

That's true. EU responded way rules based organisation can.

The issue individual member states acted. went joint response known way EU works would make suboptical. failed implement national security directives would guaranteed supply. They've critcised particular vaccines of, apparently, spite.

These individual member state issues. EU. US official language. important vaccinate many people possible stop spread virus limit future mutations. mass gathering prohibition crucial. People wrongly portrayed Sweden virus denying state (""what do? public orgies! YOLO!""). reality, preventing mass gatherings people complying probably important piece abatement widespread vaccination. Ruth Davidson nothing complain about. shit! AZ failing deliver EU? next? Wet water? Canada ordered like 10 doses per person, ordered doses per capita country third deaths per capita though. expectations AZ incredibly low, somehow still manage disappoint. Even variants? source would love read it. (Not sarcastic btw, genuinely interested.) goal comparables hold much still possible see differences more.

When differing outcomes nations similar background factors, policy matters more.

Sweden took strongly divergent policy neighbors. saying great compared Albania meaningful comparison saying poorly compared Norway. get angry people say we'll still wearing masks social distancing 2022.

Maybe, maybe not. jeez, let people hope optimism! That's great Exactly. get vaccinated go back normal. I'll still wear mask bit, idk others vaccinated. Nationwide, yes, steepest part wave came holidays daily cases increasing much Christmas New Years. Plus areas country earlier waves saw low levels around holidays, indication individual behavior different.

The holidays can't explain existence wave. could argue peak higher would otherwise also possible that's natural, self-sustaining curve large increase October-November. see, thanks correcting. stay fuck inside stop commenting. I'm listening. Let‚Äôs keep tin-foil, anti-vax conspiracy shit subreddit. 

1) Everyone going vaccine effort, pharma government buyers public health experts, clear need multiple vaccines play order get everyone. Moderna others simply can‚Äôt keep demand. 

2) would media companies across globe, including public media, care whether one two pharma companies make little little less profit? That‚Äôs vast international conspiracy you‚Äôre alleging main actors little motive engage one. 

3) data AZ objectively complex results mRNA vaccines. Everyone initially excited AZ, since mRNA vaccines produced unexpectedly amazing results AZ ok great results SA, shouldn‚Äôt surprise average consumer thinks ‚Äúhey, else equal guess want one slightly higher protections‚Äù. 

Let‚Äôs start inventing vast international conspiracies zero proof. That‚Äôs Q shit it‚Äôs public health hazard breeds distrust vaccines. Social distancing broad term. social distancing happens, people voluntarily coming close contact people. example, people friends indoors, people choosing buying things online instead going store.

Almost legally enforced even NJ. Agreed, hand I'm sure useful point fingers party existed 40 years ago. anything testament dangers excessive privatization Conservatives keep pushing thr stupidity treating government entity that's meant turn profit. Yes. massive spike holidays. much Holiday super spreaders versus seasonality something curious though.

Cases started rising fast long holidays. Yes! bad news gets thrusted us constantly, could see coming? Looks like 2021 reparative year. like stated term ""offer"" drugs. Little confused though, prevents hospitalisation 85%-95% great news actual spread immunities getting it? covid positive chick pooper last night infected takeaway: Government funding free undergraduate education leads significant scientific advancements. yet meet single individual believes COVID-19 hoax. I've met plenty people younger healthier believe risk contracting virus feeling effects symptoms low.
 
And act accordance risk/reward ratio unique everyone. Right. So, people say ""lockdowns work"" mean (closing schools businesses, banning gatherings) work? yes, that's wrong. mean done, forcing people stay homes add effect? yes, right. 

So, problem term ""lockdown"" alone badly defined. feels like way Covid deniers months ago.

That getting downvoted oblivion? Saying going back semblance normalcy fully vaccinated make ""Covid denier"". Population density? Stockholm metropolitan area population half population Finland Norway. Lost job, draining retirement income, can't save kids' college. Hoping job next year become homeless two kids. Yeah, could worse. Comparables meant perfect. meant better others. 

Do think residents Stockholm common residents Madrid Oslo?

Even though apparently ""dont' clue it"" seem able identify Oslo Stockholm roughly latitude, tell Sweden, Finland, Norway, Iceland bottom four nations population density Europe, Norway part Sweden 1905, Nordic Passport Union allows complete free movement due similar cultures. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Joking course, that's great news. people 50 much lower 1% chance dying. people 65+ inflate IFR. Encouraging news. Saving lives health already. two questions have, assume receive ire many, are: 
 
* many deaths caused solely COVID-19.
* deaths complicated precipitated COVID-19 many likely died year regardless?
 
There doubt pandemic increased speed number deaths. nuanced story top line number absent context. 3 people dying elderly pre existing health conditions have, yea might take risk. Another part problem hidden 1

But also kind by. unable work couple days following first AZ dose, mean fearing life anything, fever joints really really hurt, extent much beyond sleeping eventually playing little bits Mario Odyssey bed 48 hours so. 

That logistical problem *for workplace,* lots people experience it, means might need particularly organised spread rollout staff take Mario days time, individuals see would dealbreaker. I‚Äôm guessing Arctic blast keeping country home decrease asymptomatic testing used write lack SuperBowl spike promote idea cases go back March/April. healthcare works. 

It advanced countries. I'm awaiting mine (AZ). new information waiting 3 months rather 4 weeks shots provides better protection? Even everyone wearing masks might still risks, masks magical shields put level catching COVID zero. much likely survive car crash wearing seatbelt, give 100% protection. Regardless, still wear seatbelt.  Yep, wearing masks somehow went ""flatten curve"" ""how many people die put second mask?"". Either way, succeeded making country look pathetic. you. technically english official language USA. Yeah least country same, 3rd wave high (though fast time) holidays im still right Yeah least country same, 3rd wave high (though fast time) holidays drive? You‚Äôre always high chance fatal car wreck  Automod said original comment high quality, let's try again.

Yes, agree needing workspace away distractions. PhD student, decade experience knowing need away home focus. change overnight (or ever possibly), I've expected change overnight.

My ability focus all-time low. Comparing rate transmission within one workplace entire community going tell effective is. FYI everyone getting vaccine recorded file one batch. person also given vaccine card info too. can't simply say ""get vaccinated reopen""? reasonably right choose treatment. Now, reasonable lot work sentence welcome dispute offering choice vaccines reasonable pandemic circumstances. However, I'd argue reasonable. Personally, I'd rather take AZ vaccine. Yeah one work! small pockets community across US may close reaching natural herd immunity, true majority United States. estimate natural herd immunity 2-3 million dead. Almost every major city country potential overwhelm hospitals remove restrictions. Many employed 2019 still work, vast majority public gatherings happening. curve still actively flattened.

The light end tunnel there, lot continuing restrictions enough people vaccinated. considered who, please post source. Flu deaths usually around 45k per year US. Covid clearly serious thought Cyberpunk update. Ship places weather problem send next batch affected areas. difficult. flexible logistics. also given marketing approval EMA. know what‚Äôs annoying masks? Waiting line get places limited capacity. able casually grab drink friend work bullshit couple hours. way bigger inconvenience wearing mask. I‚Äôll never understand big deal wearing one. Yeah, get annoying way worse inconveniences piece fabric face. Exactly! men‚Äôs sperm quality goes well. There‚Äôs reason older men can‚Äôt sperm donors.

I three cousins babies late 30s one downs baby. Couple fact every parent know says wishes they‚Äôd kids younger bodies stronger, doesn‚Äôt really inspire push odds pregnancy 40. OOPS Covid vaccine caused husband stabbed 37 times chest, where's money? 1.5m doses used 150,000. Paywalled fact right top paywall kicks in. keep complying blind obedience questions get freedom back real soon sunny Yes are. Totally topic, West Virginia potential premier destination People done summer holidays EU last summer, combination vaccines summer almost surely reduce official cases extremely low levels... paper shows longer wait effective. US. favourite thing lately watch countries variant dominant strain. UK South Africa. Hmmm bet cases deaths looking bad right? Wrong. match Canada‚Äôs America‚Äôs trends closely. 

I‚Äôm Covid denier means. I‚Äôll get vaccine September Canadian government ready ( ü§û ). I‚Äôll follow guidelines ignore family wanting visit months. variants looking like media creation. Again, denying variants actually exist, denying hysteria caused impact rather media. Super Bowl NFL football games attendees months! Yes, events full capacity, still. fucked IMO ban mass gatherings, least important mundane things like social distancing shops similar places. early markers floor, constant reminders PA systems keep safe distance, plexiglass front checkout counters checkout lanes, bagging areas etc. true, parents live right near Lakewood Ranch (the community question). normal planned community (not gated). large mix housing including lot elderly people. say? I‚Äôll wear mask grocery store years want long start traveling going concerts going inside friends‚Äô houses end 2021 conspiracies man got yet - I'm weeks away (hopefully) getting Canadian PR (permanent residency). I'll able get citizenship 2.5 years later. Neat.

It ends get vaccine. Amazing went corona-chan vaccine-chan less year every society morons. different small scale study positive cases. 4 positive cases there's massive confidence interval.

Hospitalization better, also consider risk, would slightly increased risk short amount time. I'm PhD student also works full time, losing school space away work office home incredibly detrimental effect school performance mental health. actually need third space focus. I've gone decade higher ed knowing cannot focus homework home need remove distractions. something change overnight (or maybe even ever), yet that's expected me. say otherwise, surprising given respective trial data (and extrapolating two-dose symptomatic efficacy one-dose hospitalisation efficacy). Maybe time pubs, haircuts, gyms stop waiting government come senses? Maybe time pubs, haircuts, gyms stop waiting government come senses? Why? Really, pandemic step regional epidemics, step national epidemics, step subnational epidemics, step local epidemics, step local outbreaks. Where, ladder, colloquial understanding whether pandemic ""over"" likely depend live. 

If United States steps national epidemic state-wide epidemics, local epidemics, Americans pandemic (this mixing ""epidemic"" ""pandemic""). people living anywhere epidemic ongoing, ""pandemic"" still continues (same error; pandemic series epidemics span world...it possible pandemic exist absence local epidemic, local epidemic rage absence pandemic). Canada give leftover doses away developing countries. totally political based, trust anything said quasi-effective leadership. Macron successfully armed brexiteers actual ammo brexit might good idea. possible: get stuck twice, masks get tossed. Australians... Bloody mad boys are. much sun.  I'm trying imagine living perspective. Like back early 2000's SARS concern. living Midwest, office East Coast. wearing blue surgical masks around office anytime handled packages overseas, remember thinking crazy/overreacting.  fair though, know facts -- 20's knew everything seem directly effect me. true, overly optimistic people think going back normal like flipping switch. take time people adjust feel safer vaccinations lower cases. thanks this. many people subreddit feel entitled normalcy. like, none us want this, 500,000 Americans dead let go unfettered going get worse. choose sacrifice ways make things better. OP calling making kids wear masks ""depressing"" must virus, lost family members, lost job, tell lot depressing, situation child. Unrelated, know, comment nice moment sanity. Australians... Bloody mad boys are. much sun.  talked holidays increased travel cause. Shouldn‚Äôt cases Christmas decreasing now?

February hollidays, ski resort closed people go coast find sun Best case scenario would meeting someone later year getting married 2023, child 2025. would 37, pushing it.

So basically need decide important parent me. Really wish ex hadn‚Äôt strung along I‚Äôd dumped sooner. decide become single mother choice baby, likely would place date I‚Äôm 40s.

It‚Äôs mind-boggling. depends state you‚Äôre in. Florida already allowing things happen right now. California? know it‚Äôll go (especially Bay Area). don‚Äôt without going Google, read effectiveness reports vaccines one died covid following two weeks waiting period first shot. Anyone already infected got close shot still 0 immunity. Anyone who‚Äôs catching mild case. Influenza several different bits RNA genome, meaning susceptible animal gets infected two time, potential reshuffling variants new combinations quickly.

Coronavirus method-of-entry known science (ACE2 receptor). virus keys entry points. Coincidentally, ""key"" spike protein immune system detects, kinda fucked reach herd immunity (potentially).


And finally, yes, one core reasons hearing variants possibly escaping immunity zero selective pressure evade already recovered human virus widespread, recovered mixed back population. Look confidence interval. 95% confidence, say efficacy somewhere -142% (i.e. much likely get COVID) 81% effective. There's enough data time-frame accurately pin-point efficacy. even exports EU US, know that's Pfizer Moderna. guess Moderna would go Switzerland though, EU.

It's fair enough, long Pfizer/Biontech continue deliver promise EU contracts. acting like baby? Indeed. Australia 50M doses order (pending approval doubt). might like take 2 seconds day facetious, first study AZ Pfeizer vaccines measured efficacy outside clinical trial - i.e. amongst population entire country. meant using multiple vaccines. yeah, Germany talking topping AZ different vaccine later hasn‚Äôt decided yet. Better Finland.
280k reveived first dose target 4 million probably going take year, fml. said Covid settles air 2-3 hours, recall reading (can‚Äôt remember now), stay air much longer, even days. not. referring attempt handwave away Swedens excess mortality compared neighbours.

Basically Sweden objectively failed strategy. rest Europe varying degress. rest Europe also puts effort spin working solutions. Trump also public relations menace. knows sees one. it‚Äôs backfiring. BURN THING ! another boarderline ridiculous study far small sample size taken seriously without follow-ups. Much like one. Good you. thank you. someone works people indoors, many six feet away, lol. strict mask policy covid rates significantly lower rest community. makes 0% sense? probably fine, health approvals work way.

Actually kind *can* work way. Part UK's decision approve 12 week gap doses based medical regulator using existing expertise knowledge make judgement-based decision approval. Subsequent evidence since appeared vindicate decision, image posters sub give us taking huge gamble results misinformed. Nah it‚Äôs linked here, deletes varied lot region. North South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico peaked November. Washington, Utah California mid-December. areas peak January. spread virus clearly schedule tied Except people wearing masks deserved shamed they‚Äôre contributing spread virus big reason we‚Äôve continue taking precautions almost entire year. Meanwhile, choosing wear mask literally hurts one you‚Äôre asshole harass someone wearing one. order preference would be:
 
* Pfizer
* Moderna

* J&amp;J
 
But I'll end line probably get choice. 
multiplying risk covid infection dozen times ~~own brits~~ fall American pharmaceutical propaganda  varied lot region. North South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico peaked November.

But, fact check more: day made speech, Dec. 28, two weeks distribution, U.S. administered total 3.5 million doses vaccine. measuring Day One, daily average 250,000 ‚Äî would take four times rate get Biden‚Äôs goal 1 million even then, Biden misleadingly ignoring upward trend.

Okay that's fair argument literally 20 years ago US try properly thank/repay (Gander place outside US steel WTC also raised millions scholarship money Gander).

Like I'm cool Canada, they're great allies, help can. jusy disagree US currently indebted them. Question: ""70-75% needed herd immunity"" come from? possible real herd immunity % PARTICULAR coronavirus actually 50% 40%? herd immunity % universal regardless virus type? can't imagine vaccines made much difference quickly.....a 77% drop six weeks nuts. *gasp* could speak poorly highly enlightened le Europeans? good you. try stop young healthy people want vaccine getting it. 

Not everyone healthy fortunate you. secure agreements. That's part leader. get downvotes pointing obvious Percent one word fyi  cure worse disease... Detroit nurse here. got offered quite awhile ago. Although fair amount refused get smh. one change that, policy decisions reverse course this. I'm even line I'm young healthy. sick long remember, everyone know who's gotten covid gotten week. I'll gladly help someone guarantee safety death expense mild discomfort, would hate put others. Israel small country inked deal Pfizer basically run phase four trial there. US current pace could vaccinate everyone Israel less week (just comparisons sake). Store snow! oopsie poopsie there's also us whose industries operate profit towards end ""normality"" timeline. industries can't plan returns, timelines moved months months. finally vaccine, finally see light end tunnel, yet ""return normalcy"" keeps getting pushed back, affecting livelihoods, businesses we've dedicated lives to, mental health. lot. Lol what? Facebook news back up? tell straight face conservatives complained ""wasted tax dollars"" liberal government tried fix it.

Keep mind, pandemic planned, known problem would solved forcing barely profitable vaccine production (unprofitable design) back Canada. see current need it, decision would criticized (other happening late). feel pain mate, SE Asia, family. would love head back Canada work see relatives, fear leave guarantee might able get back see them.

I really hope I'm wrong dude. I'd give LOT wrong. Laughs veteran received experimental vaccines before. scare all. tried convince others scared despite mRNA vaccines employed good long easy adapt. starting scratch. Trumps administration billions dollars vaccine development quickly moved secure supply. It‚Äôs USA well today comes vaccine distribution. Great waiting years vaccine.

You, hand, get back line believe rich foreigners able come U.S. get do. elephant meat dishes Maybe that's thinking of. Thank you. rare person wants wear mask protect others, course reasonable. Asian countries, hell lot support, obsessive mask wearing one. say masks never regular thing - think many believe mandatory masks months time become norm. saying we‚Äôll never get there. Well let's say standards seem different EU, Switzerland EUA, let's leave that.

Surely pressure, know UK govt need paddle whole Brexit best deal century, right?

It's different standards misunderstandings. Biden slowly getting trump vaccine there. Even though first biden forgot vaccine.

This also ‚ÄúWe gonna lots vaccine summer it‚Äôs matter convincing family, friends, colleagues anyone else need get vaccine,‚Äù Osterholm said. ‚ÄúIf happens, could really good place summer, particularly late summer.‚Äù

This also Osterholm said pandemic happen again. said it‚Äôs if, when, hopefully next time prepared.

Again, Osterholm predicts surge next two months UK variant. variant resistant vaccine.

Fact US vaccinating Canadian population daily! thank new president takes serious previous one means got it, thanks *puts dusty old glasses back on* People received vaccines still supposed follow health regulations: masking, within 6 feet anyone outside household, hugging, etc. IMO cases sub 500 per day USA population hit least 40% vaccination rate. Purely IMO, think hit stats, really low rate covid transmission start thinking going back normal. Keep mind 500 per day US 10 people per state per day, also keeping mind case transmission rate continuing go down. Canada laws limiting drug prices. companies charge local US governments hospitals whatever want. profit. Also many friends graduated prestigious colleges. They're trouble finding work. Many actually full-time positions lined offers dropped due COVID. lot companies looking save money careful due dropped productivity. Plus can't go stress relief everyone quarantining.

Stress rates hitting time highs right now. Per Asked CNN's Dana Bash ""State Union"" whether thinks Americans still need wear masks next year, Fauci replied: ""You know, think possible that's case and, again, really depends mean normality.""

Mild cough huh? Tell families young puerile died Covid. 

Just goes show oblivious this. Respectfully, ‚Äòperformance‚Äô comparisons pandemic total wash. 

How hard country hit COVID largely population densities, social psychology. coincidence US UK also perhaps liberally minded countries world. like told do, like authority. stay home asked, still visit family, still mingle pub. 

The UK applauded start pandemic moving faster anyone introducing measures. numbers started go sideways, people started assume must mean government bad job. didn‚Äôt. We‚Äôve best scientific minds working start, government listened every step.

The simple truth much stop spread COVID without becoming unpleasantly authoritarian. That‚Äôs good point. many saying wear mask another year actually wearing one consistently far? US vaccinating people per day Canada total, good number countries even see mass vaccinations 2023. Consider fortunate stop whining like fucking children. matter, literally 1.6 million people live Manhattan. need services goods.

Of course there's risk involved, people take risk position reap rewards. promise many will. successful? way. many will. wonderful book called ""bullshit jobs"".
The answer UBI. thought India well? kind sick roller coaster ride this? Really bad comparison What‚Äôs harm? Everyone wants successful. partisanship people wishing otherwise maybe need take step back. true. next, use football field reference? Horrifying. started following last week.

I would say, people listen still ear inner circle information. 

These kinds people listen to. time, solely. ones access information regular slugs don't. Babies vaccinated mothers antibodies cord blood mother vaccinated three weeks prior. they're breathing, bigger problems social/psychological development think. many children suffocated due masks? many people think. It‚Äôs probably coping mechanism. Bad stuff happens people; care about. think pretty common mindset people goes beyond COVID. particularly true young much less likely experienced something traumatic lives. example extreme, wonder would vaccine could charge more.

I idea limits production speed would bet improved money. covid feb 2020 orthopedic surgeon neck surgery that's going come popped up.bilateral apical pleural thickening... I've never around asbestos never pneumonia... fuck Take anything Osterholm says massive grain salt. Vaccines prioritized greatest risk. explicitly mentioned comorbidities, record. think elderly people die young healthy people avoid mild cough. Slow, yes. Question extent. extent yet known. I'm surprised people realizing massive mental health impact. mainstream media, two narratives: death toll politics. Everything else fallen wayside. Last summer, heard news infection rates going young people fault. 'If get corona, get corona' hear depression loneliness increasing.

Part reason think stories got much attention subreddit people made massive moral judgment. wanted outside, 'being risky'. wanted friends, 'being selfish'. idea 'being human' enter conversation. People said big deal home time. day? Sure. week? Maybe, get bored pretty quickly introvert. month? way. time kept stretching, judgment never stopped. want go home Thanksgiving Christmas? 'You're killing grandma!' think people gotten tired fearmongering.

Just basic stuff like washing hands, keeping distance mask can't enough without lockdowns. reality people sit house alone. may seem like lot do, think that‚Äôs they‚Äôre subreddit since just, know, sit home alone. 

So Sunday Super Bowl Party isn‚Äôt different Friday Poker game week kids‚Äô sleepover week that. I'm happy U.S., they've rough. We'll get vaccines Canada soon enough. I'm guessing U.S. fully vaccinated early we'll probably able import instead Europe. North America's best interest. Except that's less US did. drops US 6% fully vaccinated. either form herd immunity restrictions worked, despite lots people shrugging off. relax restrictions vaccinations make enough arms, spike again. intense feeling sympathy many young folks like lost much integral time life. Empty words, hope things turn towards brighter soon mom get tell are, know give shit argument morons regarding giving vaccines countries. absolutely nothing comment, dumbass. want advocate point, without stating outright falsehoods idiot. UK vaccinating people longer pretty much anyone else Europe kid school entire time (private school) wearing mask. big deal. Theres less 10 confirmed cases school (K-8) zero cases transferred among students staff. Every confirmed case outside school. Brother. tired burnt-out physician US, country giving kinda hope desperately need. flu shit shut world every year much news, considering people nice responsible lockdown help community quarantine, irresponsible import cases flew casue new round tracing quarantine, frustrated MSG one sports stadiums city opening 10% capacity too, right? God damn, millions made making irony sarcasm font. come America, shit seems pretty dire land timber syrup Meh. ask 100 people ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù means get 100 different answers. some, type restriction lockdown. others, strict measures lockdowns. 

Lockdowns work followed enforced. keep people away driving infection significantly. beginning many experts calling hard short lockdown robust contact tracing programs implemented. U.S. never tried. states tried hold tight others gave weeks loose ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù. never know strategy would‚Äôve worked. 

I agree lockdowns taken place around world long unenforceable pointless nothing alienate everybody hurt try adhere it. agree, want to. Nobody stopping anyone completing isolating world scared virus Yeah you‚Äôre strawmanning

How exactly? real discussion

Ok expressing opinion desire real. suppose nothing personally 100% agree likewise fake. easy manipulate

Zero attempt manipulate part,just expressing opinion. characterized way suggests one that's got interest actual discussion. Years.  explain states like Florida, South Dakota Texas, significantly less restrictions states like New York, New Jersey, MA, California, comparably less/ roughly deaths hospitalization rates Hopefully leads less less deaths, though deaths today last sunday  successful, married, early 30's millennial, amazing time college say best years life. Instead would say college LED lead best years life. 

I met bonded best friends I've ever had, met wife, unforgettable experience occur living bunch unrelated / unconnected people globe different socio economic background. 

Because formed bonds experienced life people met college, experience rest adult life them. other's weddings, go trips, help someone needs it.

I think narrow minded thinking college partying making dumb decisions. people years live away family going back hometowns/helping parents/starting career/ etc. Missing first second year could huge consequences bonds could've formed someone special. idea. used work industry, deliberate investment multinationals downright criminal (IMO). factoring 2 doses starting? whole fucking thread something else. Commenters can't tolerate thought wear masks another year, half rest world even see mass vaccination 2023. entitlement display absolutely mind-blowing. Every single person lost sacrificed things result covid. US surpassed 500,000 deaths it. lost job opportunities, new beginning life, etc. well. health family friend‚Äôs health. 

Pretty tough feel bad someone‚Äôs kid getting prom wedding getting delayed real problems devastations covid caused still causing Usa always number 1, highest cases/deaths, best vaccination numbers. America. Yeah true say. think underestimating bad people supposed protecting. Old people isolated care homes, seeing family last years. People really need suport getting it. recognize applies young people variants? mean? suggesting past year hasn‚Äôt ‚Äúflatten curve don‚Äôt overwhelm hospitals?‚Äù /s Exactly. sub become pathetic. thought overuse result permanent damage... Why? Ontario barely herd immunity, 7/100k. possible Sorry experience offends you. That‚Äôs need leave. Tired feeling way. Tired offending people blacks don‚Äôt get treated right it‚Äôs getting worse. Yeah mental health gotten progressively worse last year never ending pandemic . trapped inside home, able visit family seen years able travel taken toll . many things wanted last year . realized never take things granted think stuff always won't. 2020 proved . hope things get better eventually I'm still trying remain cautiously optimistic even though know future hold . genuinely feel bad college students right now. situation sucks.

However, everyone opportunity type experience pre-COVID. 4 years working first undergrad trying, emotionally draining, fruitless years life. work upwards 30 hours week times studying pay expenses, made meaningful connections friendships (didn't time/energy), earn degree ultimately proved useless career-wise.

Yes, plenty good experiences, nothing like unburdened young-adult utopia describe.

Admittedly, know like college student right now\*. However, understand visceral resentment comes feeling robbed ""college experience"" due factors control. absolutely sucks, OK upset it. But, certain point, choose move make hand dealt.

\*I actually working online B.S. right now, recognize distance learning intentionally 27 different 18-22 expense in-person experience expecting have. huge difference coming saying thinks we're going masking 2022 asked reporter possible saying ""sure, possible."" This. Canadians basically irrationally shouting clouds. don‚Äôt didn‚Äôt ability build next generation bioreactors time needed deploy mRNA vaccines they‚Äôre currently clamouring for. didn‚Äôt gut vaccine production we‚Äôd able build AZ vaccine... already access thousands doses weren‚Äôt going use immediately anyways! Man waiting long. fiance french American literally week away getting visa come get married together forever. covid happened embassies shut down.

We already waited two years another year covid. want world return normalcy finally marry her. Long distance hard even harder covid.  realize Covid worse right? benefits Canada well? They‚Äôre literally neighbor pretty explainable:

LA way crowded. OC lot space things, whether eating outdoors going beach/hiking.

LA also much front line workers, exposure. OC/SD WFH That's one reason Healthcare affordable. invest research. situation definitely biting butt. expectation California's cases fall people continue wear masks, limit interactions, government acts business limit interactions. opposite happens opposite occurs.

You must live California. Besides masks, free anywhere else besides San Francisco proper (which rather small area). think exposure rate nearing 50 percent giving good amount herd resistance, something off. Also, obviously California 3.5 million cases, confirmed. gave Youyang Gu's current California estimate, he's decently spot past. accusing users arguing bad faith üõ° least don‚Äôt go debt surgery ridiculous offensive comment. perfectly fine sentiment imo. objection excluding long term undocu immigrants (farm workers, hotel maids, etc.), sound like we're that. dig name, how'd come Yes, huge number people already infected level immunity. younger kids school yet fewer paths infection transmission. healthcare joke... needed vaccines Canada worse don‚Äôt really get much time USA college honestly lot tv shows movies portray here. fucking phenomenal time life changed entirely person someone scared shelled someone learned communicate others scared everyone. feel bad people missing this. Trump dealt shitty hand Obama. another canadian living former maritime bubble family Ontario it‚Äôs blowing mind part, wore masks trusted PM end situation. Hopefully ramp up.  realize benefits well right? Hey, science sub. scared talk menstruation, hide behind silly sarcasm. normal process really reason alive right make rude comment. islands. say doesn‚Äôt matter, specifically said 2019 Pandemic NPI document way strategy would work islands. still ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù every weeks/months. false. Palestinian areas (A B) full PA civil control. article restrictions Israel proper, distinction citizens (so that's apartheid).

I suggest read article easy produce vaccines. want quality medication takes time max one facility takes time set (or essentially rent out) another. big corporation thing, actual people busting ass since started showing work throughout pandemic. 

Not mention supply shortages feed vaccine manufacturers due covid. simple ""pony up"". can't argue doctor elderly person one country deserving another. 39. Although genetic disorder one studied regards covid, heart/lung involvement much case case basis, count. 

People age 50-64 scheduled start vaccinated till end March, behind schedule, unless something changes pushed back April best. finally start people comorbidities. 

35k people
200-300 vaccines arriving week, idea when/if increase. 
That math put 'likely less 3' unfortunately. smaller population switching healthcare system one like US wouldn‚Äôt solve issue special. 500,000 covid deaths relatively easy prevent. Instead aiming save many citizens possible, Trump, administration, Republican Party purposefully lied severity disease, control it, speed spreads. can't sneeze spread heart disease another person, covid. 500,000 people die. 15 30, every year something new special, whole world own.

I'm scientist seems like would interesting thing learn about. guess would long term studies people track going periods. 

Anecdotally, I'm PMSing like hell right now, received second Moderna vaccine 2 weeks ago. think mine fine! Ha! Anthony Fauci, nation‚Äôs top infectious disease expert, estimated 70% 85% reach herd immunity.

We cutting close 21 percent cant get vaccinated plus anti vaxxers. It‚Äôs also possible we‚Äôll wearing masks 2035 it‚Äôs 100% won‚Äôt. There‚Äôs point giving unlikely timelines cover yourself. population much smaller... Ellipses usually used imply reader see thought headed next

I idea trying imply statement. Perhaps could elaborate Damn that‚Äôs insane amount people Summer going normal, summer's going hook. Probably. cases slowly rise again... frustrating  It‚Äôs hilarious smug Canadians onset, even cheering border closed (which Canadian initiated), we‚Äôre supposed somehow guilt-tripped short changing taxpayers citizens shouldered significant chunk developing/financing *multiple* vaccines entire world benefit from. 

I like Canadians hope situation improves, ridiculous. Man, can't tell much empathize you. lucky found love life January 2020. I‚Äôm 27 I've already college. 

I wanted say, hey, chin man, we‚Äôre almost there. know roaring 20s coming back? 1918, Influenza pandemic pretty much went thing did. That's 20s roaring. everyone took everyday life granted stay isolated other. over, bet ass partied decade haha we! real I'm kind drunk thinking much many deaths could avoided makes cry. logic seriously flawed yeah... crazy much worse things LA compared OC SD  mean still wear one lol Yup, especially nose pieces like mine do. pull em right nose piece they'll snug fog all.

Breaking new masks, however, sooooo annoying know. assume would something local gov failing fight priority kind, places state going much faster. mother 64, 50-64 schedule late March, behind schedule without change get pushed back. 

Part may also Cali simply ignores existence. Hard call upper bay area ""norther"" acknowledge parts state 7 hours drive north. rural people know us know drove us get Oregon. grew Bay Area, moved recently, different world. lot companies looking save money careful due dropped productivity. Plus can't go stress relief everyone quarantining.

This, plus recent college grad, really made go damn, struggled for? world want build career family in? going live sake eating paying rent? Made really think kids, environmental reason anything, seemed immoral create life exist like this. Yeah, shit, US far cases Canada greater needs. also invested resources infrastructure make vaccines. didn‚Äôt Canada? people didnt, restaurants closed LA year.

OC SD, different story. Ya shit Thankfully rarely rub eyes, especially without washing hands touch face good look Probably USA needs them, Trudeau make contracts napkins. Meanwhile won‚Äôt enough vaccines vaccinate entire adult population July, everything goes plan... Stay home, save lives, sure use Amazon need anything. irony together... People east normalized wearing masks see why. plan wear mask everywhere might wear mask go anywhere crowded, especially around flu season, foreseeable future. 

I sick since whole thing started that's kinda nice. Thank you. used people dying heart attacks decades doesn‚Äôt make less news worthy special 500,000k COVID deaths? see South Africa dropped vaccines. miss smiling laughing, facial expressions hearing people clearly. want go gym without mask.

The things love - concerts, bars, team sports, bar trivia, restaurants dates, house parties movies. hindered eliminated unless there‚Äôs social distancing, hindered masks. 

If pick poison would masks. masks really made effective distancing. It‚Äôs hard imagine situation one other.

I dream going neighborhood bar 5 friends sitting around table playing cards drinking jazz night. going dive bar see local group perform. simply going coffee shop sitting sipping coffee without fumbling mask down.

You‚Äôre probably sensing frustration first comment, it‚Äôs frustrated. I‚Äôm going crazy. I‚Äôve right thing almost year. live alone went breakup covid. don‚Äôt enough energy caution left listen health experts push goalposts it‚Äôs likely people vaccinated summer fall. 

They need give us fucking light end this. efforts fail don‚Äôt acknowledge needs end, it‚Äôs worth risk vulnerable people protected. Yep. Talk often, media people it/prep principals. open don‚Äôt know, numbers trying get, guesses you‚Äôre making info have.

We hints months ago single dose regime offered good protection. country could taken gamble, doubled supply. Sometime take risks.

It‚Äôs crazy production numbers aren‚Äôt public. Knowing many vaccine coming week, fast that‚Äôs increasing would huge. People wait know roughly long it‚Äôll be. still way higher % people vaxxed. (20% 36m easier 20% 320m) something punctuation? pull glasses closer nose tip. Especially sucks claimed dependents parents 2019 didn‚Äôt get stimulus checks (at least US). We‚Äôre dying financially brainwashing proletariat part plan action, would worried. integral part game. end give damn ""young"" see vaccines start getting allowed go normal things time months away access. 

Vaccine exceptions ends narrative small effort isolated (the argument older people less time made, resonate). Vaccine exemptions open pandora's box debating priority list awful obvious way. Mostly, mark immediate change sense collective responsibility back individual choice.

Unfortunately seems likely that's exactly happen. We've already seen hinted Fauci terrify us. [2010 65 million (21%) 16. use 21% extrapolate population 328 million, that‚Äôs 69 million. Notable case rate dropping cliff right now. think bunch things contributing including natural herd immunity select population groups. People likely get spread got already. 20% vaccinated. Yes, possible bad preventable. young adults risk homelessness too. every student lucky enough family able/willing support retail/food/hospitality job shuts survive restrictions. fair though, look population difference. So? Getting vaccine ""deserving"" it. know rhetoric adopted HCWs first line, truly highest risk getting damaging public health. Yep, viruses that. COVID outlier. Yes are. yet 12 million unused doses sitting shelves US. number approaches zero, I'll believe shortage. 21 grad school labs full people couldn‚Äôt graduate normal amount time there‚Äôs many slots left attend. went FEMA Incident Command Structure training last year, one things emphasized open clear communications public, holding press conferences instead releasing statement. example cited doe it, training exercise command staff told 'media' asking questions incident, asked wanted do, said going press conference.

Things like break trust public officials think things held them. topical! ID Tennessee proudly announced couple weeks ago literally started vaccinating late January. Good them. Also eff Canada lagging far behind developed country boggles mind. non peer reviewed article, didn‚Äôt publish enough data say, perhaps right Pretty sure internet run ""the said 2022 fun 2021 fucked!"" narrative. Ugh.

But *is* great news. anglosphere, it'll certain end socially *way* literal title 'pandemic' ends globally. I‚Äôm major SoCal county that‚Äôs La tell saw weekend, pandemic parts metropolitan SoCal. take long. Probably early summer. Cmon know America third world country /s friend lost percentage good. Made slower. virus fade away people immune, reducing risk immensely said trying say clear simple way. education taken huge hits past year, funding actually awesome - least work. already gotten additional grant funding state planning increased funding next 3 years compensatory services. say, getting $ schools, teachers, students exactly work administrator. I‚Äôve nearly doubled budget past year cover additional supplies (can‚Äôt share materials easily now), virtual/digital resources, COVID-specific PPE, summer learning opportunities. Frankly, I‚Äôve impressed state local response thus far. Again, securing allocating $ something teachers time training do. love work get great satisfaction know makes difference teachers students. work agency state (special tax district full state agency), back work many months‚Ä¶ However true state agencies still working home, DeSantis parades around‚Ä¶

The state open true FL state agency back office, however everyone else must open. Amen that! lockdowns curfews largest populations Canada 1.5 months. cases went lockdowns. going stop, best course action I've found put piece medical tape right gaps might occur create enough barrier prevent fogging occurring. viscerally uncomfortable without seeing people masks washing hands.

Good. People adapt, change. Get used future even weird. Interesting analysis. put vegetables eyes. I've learned many people really adapt well. people can't learnt wear mask study virtually supportive family, hell live I‚Äôm sure read article here‚Äôs another  every year, perhaps.

GENERALLY speaking, would argue mental health toll lighter older people. mind could see case almost linear decline across age - damage greatest young children certain age (not sure age, whatever age kids need school getting foundationally socialized missing that, probably like 7 8 years old something), decreasing there. bit less, still heavy damage done young adults stated here. I'm sure similar people 20s 30s too. less less get older. example, imagine mid-40s dad packed work computer last March took home 2600 sqft house suburbs. He's running company's network ever since, still making good money, getting spend time wife two kids, using spare commute time finally get around working projects he's got shed collecting dust. What's mental health impact guy. Really lot. take parents 60s. Retired, Medicare, paid house, married nearly 50 years. barely leave house normal times. Sure they've bit scared past year, lives barely changed all. Like, get curbside pickup instead shopping store. That's it.

Basically, argument going hit hardest anyone life ""figured out"" yet. words - anyone single; anyone job want; anyone living situation want; on. end day, care technology age we're today - cannot build life laptop living room. want need going out, meeting people, experiencing things, building relationships, figuring stuff out. there's global pandemic shutting major avenues human interaction... that's probably going hurt you. lot. Oh Government agency 40% positivity rate estimated 2.51 excess mortality factor missing casualty count? Sounds solid. could glasses wearers simply smarter. many anti-maskers rallies seen wearing glasses? remember seeing one. Please actual research. vaccines rushed perfectly safe.

You literally slow think otherwise.

Australia 28,930 cases / 14,089,305 tests, test positivity rate 0.2%.

So every single case false, false positive rate 0.2%.

But cases proven real methods (genetic sequencing, traceable spread etc).

So false positive rate much, much lower 0.2%. don‚Äôt blame Pessimism. well may get vaccine yet. Although resentful jealous dad seems overblown. importance job aside, meeting courier around pretty much mission impossible, since never actually appear deliver anything ""sorry missed you"" cards that's without ever even ringing doorbell.

I think people overestimating vaccinating Americans look like 2021. still tens millions either refuse vaccinated able get vaccinated correctly (get first shot, second), somehow keeping us wear masks &amp; social distance refuses contract &amp; either die become immune. us didn‚Äôt option. law school told us would (partially) in-person last fall, soon paid tuition, moved 100% online.

So it‚Äôs Vaccine-Chan + Death-Chan = cash money. $400k wear mask. Every time. Every where. Correctly. Yes... even nose. Sounds like Canada EU wrote bad contracts. Japan mostly pollen allergies flu/cold. air fine even major cities. don‚Äôt like feeling sick getting others sick ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Well one S.

suck that, china ...because nationalising pharma companies might feel good actually undermine long term goal producing large supply safe effective vaccine?

Just thought. last sentence complete bs. 

The younger generation loud entitled whiny right wing boomers, really. crying moaning losing prom group social activities pandemic shows much. theory postulated seems plausible. Someone, somewhere dubbed turd immunity theory. Ironic coronavirus finally made switch contacts deal fogged glasses wearing masks. Christ. mess.

Do think uptake high?

Wishing luck England. That‚Äôs good advice. Thank friend . Canada depending countries supply vaccine countries well producing themselves. avoid Asia. think America racist black people shocked Asia another level. AZ one partners now. actual research conducted Oxford, team working since SARS. get wrong seemed insinuating vaccine somehow inferior, go trial numbers case. mRNA sure newer lot promise difference approach vaccine primarily due fact Oxford working since sometime. 

The vaccine also part Covax program received funds Gates foundation enable vaccine access everyone. Cool. 

What fuck health officers know global health pandemics spread respiratory droplets anyway?

I need party get laid. 

If people need die get drunk, it. things endanger public health common societal good. Basic civics. Lol would yes tl;dr America saves world again. you‚Äôre saying people world started Jan 9 comply?

I thought news everywhere people tired stopped complying?

It sounds like you‚Äôre making anything convince interventions working reality whole pandemic hands entire time. list complete. instance Australia started vaccinating people last week Pfizer vaccine astrazeneca one way. Japan 65+ too.(none Vaccinated yet though) think individual states, always been. It‚Äôs federal right authority, isn‚Äôt defined Constitution. state liable own, they, voters chose. big government isn‚Äôt answer. countries excel welfare expect us give away technology shed actual blood invent. Somebody's opinion disprove results multiple clinical field trials. Body aches low grade fever days. GI symptoms. fatigue like 5-6 weeks. Along loss smell taste. HR also kinda high like said I‚Äôm sure anxiety coupled sedentary something else

It weird. keep telling people anxiety worse part scared getting worse. retrospect never got bad flu mono. constant nagging fatigue wouldn‚Äôt go away weeks sad nothing deaths everything school shutdown. think I'm alone. Hopefully vaccine manufacturers ramp production there's enough everyone while. think Canada would mandatory vacation days least 14 per year. relishing Katrina made landfall took New Orleans. sent WSJ link ""Amid dire Covid warnings, one crucial fact largely ignored: Cases 77% past six ""Why number cases plummeting much faster experts ""In large part natural immunity prior infection far common measured reason think country racing toward extremely low level ""But consistent rapid decline daily cases since Jan. 8 explained natural immunity. Behavior didn‚Äôt suddenly improve holidays; Americans traveled Christmas since March. Vaccines also don‚Äôt explain steep decline January. Vaccination rates low take weeks kick in."" entire comments section literally young people whining able go parties going bars get shitfaced. That's biggest complaint comes age group they've consistent superspreaders besides people even believe covid exists. vaccine doesn‚Äôt reduce transmission still wearing mask indoors socially distanced. 

I‚Äôd interested data otherwise shows reduction transmission vaccination. AZ one. Yeah people never eaten wild boars never pretend like it‚Äôs daily danger. way right now. mother lives there, elderly haven‚Äôt first dose either. Waiting connected flight Canada moment. I‚Äôll landing Montreal spend 3 days hotel. price $888, cheapest hotel. expecting $1000 I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôd fly province live quarantine 14 days AirBnb That's really relevant. USA still double deaths adjust population (per capita). Look Zuckerberg Gates, enough hard work billionaire! Florida, we‚Äôve back normal since last April know. don‚Äôt see MB types softening working Israel. Best news ever would ""newly reported SARS-like virus reports new cases outside Wuhan March 1st"". family Massachusetts that‚Äôs basically they‚Äôve explained. lol think even looked headline discussed here.  agree schools open honestly 50 year old teacher scared go work there's got plenty young teachers would love pick job. 3 months lockdown still meet 2 households outdoors (much many parts country)? Can't help feel go well public. country pays healthcare outperforming country gives away? retrospect see comes across like that, that's meant. actually think leave things locked longer they're going to, feels like enjoyment gone world wondering countries too. think already covered that. Seasonal changes, people awareness, people infected lived, local procedures. Maybe shouldn‚Äôt hosting super spreader events don‚Äôt want get COVID. Reminds huge block parties Jewish-Orthodox communities throw things like weddings. still can. lost three relatives covid 19 though things may begin resemble ""normal"", I'll never forget people allowed virus spiral control, price loved ones paid continue pay. ""Higher risk"" relative though, 50 year old without health conditions extremely unlikely die (less life activities).

In humble opinion, tiny risk individuals worth harming education millions children. Thanks! hope things calm travel,as live,(part Tokyo 23 wards)Government say vaccinate people wish vaccinated September.

(Sorry weird English,I weakness tell ""Time"".) Why? live? live North Port. Life great, back normal months. Trump couldn‚Äôt either, media loved blast every single day idea Australian politics, Australian family levels vaccine scepticism insane me.

They keep telling UK rushed untested vaccine bad UK, opinion seemingly backed least one Australian MP. new variant infections beginning fall UK thankfully. vaccine data looks good well. America vaccinating natives reservations? Could case small proportion society responsible transmissions infections proportion society largely immune? 

E.g. population 1000 individuals 500 take many precautions get infected, 400 take precautions, 100 really take precautions. happens 100 infected died developed immunity? Trudeau good does.  make habit ignorantly calling people color racist? 90% lethal cases virus case death Germany (says source). I‚Äôm okay masking yet. K-12 education it‚Äôs early call year, first year 12 years schools haven‚Äôt gotten sick something. never going begrudge someone extra cautious, comment triggering protocol laws place forced live March July. people hated seeing UK well took criticising AZ. care may actually fuel vaccine hesitancy countries could lead deaths. least South Africa, know government isnt perfectly competent.
And actively working it.
We going around trying prove competent saying ""Hey better them"" etc.. behaving like that, point becomes News! .. ... U.K. vaccinations done age groups (with vulnerable younger people vaccinated time older people), specific :) Yes read somewhere Israel paid 40% extra get vaccine first. sure true wonderful news. especially heartening (for whatever reason) felt AZ vaccine ‚Äúworse‚Äù vaccine BioNtech/Pfizer one. Australia vast majority people due administered AZ vaccine little bit media griping - going far suggest abandon entirely wait another year sufficient BNt/Pz vaccines become available. 

As Dr Norman Swan (a doctor runs popular [ABC says) ‚Äú*The AZ vaccines changes COVID virus common cold*‚Äù. simplification, yes, one goes long way explaining vaccine critical tool fight SARS-CoV-2. I've heard true, French German citizens actually refusing AZ vaccine hopes getting ""better"" Pfizer/BioNTech one Macron lot answer for. 81% also includes recently got first dose.

After 4 weeks goes 85% 91% pfizer AZ respectively. Basically get one dose manage hold seeing people 4 weeks almost fully protected Nope, it‚Äôs news social media Australia. Zuckerberg Treasurer fight. Maybe watch you‚Äôre wooshing eh mate?! Good luck guys‚ù§Ô∏è already little bit evidence regarding AZ transmission looks hopeful ‚Äî [seems cut positive PCR tests, symptomatic asymptomatic, two feel mate, best lucks you‚ù§Ô∏è mean that's completely false, pretty established humans bad judging risk. Hey I'm teacher. Guess ok catch covid. come home spread relatives wrong. Indonesia vaccinated close 1 million people. recall Oxford ones testing non symptomatic cases trials. surprise working better. question is, well protect South African variant similar? None spikes materialized could traced back certain event. I‚Äôm still waiting Mother‚Äôs Day spike last year!   Thats right, things going like speed light, I‚Äôm amazed students got back campuses next month I‚Äôm gonna break quarantine, already long term effects. mental health shitter ever. It‚Äôs already indirectly ripped age group would made much sense spent time vaccinating teachers no. Apparently catch covid meeting one friend, class 30 kids ok. Fucking ridiculous, work school. Murica!!!! framed like this?
I mean.. Country x better Country B..

Especially considering important x is...

Is thought America.. where.. trying prove incompetent led world believe last years?

Why prove anything?
Are insecure?
Why insecure?
What's caused insecurity.

Why put energy thought solving problem, instead trying prove incompetent? Thanks. I'll wait fence. Nope. politics here. instead Charlie Crist something help, decided go person is. Politics death us all, let people. Go it! mean sincerely I‚Äôm 64. Yeah really know yet work SA variant think caution effectiveness valid. 

Hopefully studies clear and, effective, ramp production MRNA vaccines/novavax well new boosters variants. still think focus right vaccinating many people possible vaccine decent efficiency and, deaths/hospitilisations near zero, focusing suppressing new variants etc says want hear. saint sub rooting virus beginning. I‚Äôm Israeli arab it‚Äôs accessible everyone yet many anti-vaxxers, non Israeli arabs dont think available yet Virgin: ""People glasses less likely catch corona touch face often""

Chad: ""People glasses less likely catch corona one wants around nerds"" Pretty good quasi-ineffective vaccine were/are raised psycho parents treated us like pets.

Don‚Äôt go outside it‚Äôs dangerous! playing Nintendo day? generation lazy! It‚Äôs ingrained us since toddlers useless dependent meat bags couldn‚Äôt last two seconds real world.

Unless I‚Äôm projecting (I think know means). prom ""college experience"" year life over? going problem now. Germany's populations skeptical AZ now, good portion survey said want AZ vaccine.

That's going problematic know 94% effective reducing hospitalization 1 dose. get shipments eventually going convince people effective, people like Macron involves admitting wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope pandemic teaches people difference ""no evidence effectiveness"" ""not effective"". true AZ phase 3 data showed efficacy year olds (too trial statistical significance) evidence ineffective. #

It right EU people like Macron cautious, wrong extrapolate saying likely ineffective. government please? EU government + huge favour 10% population vaccinated, course least 10% people thrilled get vaccinated number likely going stop around 40% a) Pfizer, BioNTech(afaik, Sahin, guy created vaccine, reported one month ago, BNT162b2 effective enough new strains). Later independent in-office investigations confirmed message.

b) AZ bad vaccine compared Moderna BioNTech. point view. 

c) Nobody forgotten, AZ f$cked EU Germany.

BUT. Now, 6% Germany population got one jab, AZ good. AZ must promoted. But... state propaganda, way. 

AZ could made mandatory teachers policemen - easy effective step, Merkel lost mind fully prefer nothing. ‚ÄúBut WANTED to!‚Äù Well US doesn‚Äôt give Israel $4b tell buy vaccine spent anywhere, grant given Israel buy army equipments US only, meaning Israel buying covid vaccines US taxpayer. Secondly counts less 1% Israel GDP mention Israel gives back technology intelligence legacy media dying. They‚Äôre thrashing trying grasp onto anything keep going, year pause decline trump gone pandemic wrapping up, they‚Äôre panic mode. Oh, that's bit weird - would send teachers back point without vaccinating them? I'd hate teacher right never wanted expected young people put lives hold me. me, expectation lot selfish young people want hang beach. Pandemic pandemic, willing take responsibility health.  lie. Canada making vaccines company's plant-based COVID-19 vaccine candidate Phase 2 clinical trials. things go according plan, 80 million doses end year, produced facilities Canada U.S.""

In addition, Canadas active cases Covid extremely low. half population vaccinated April/May Canada gonna tiny pockets virus left completely surrounded vaccinated people. Essentially, Canada defeat Covid U.S. amazing early efforts mitigating numbers. counter measures last year work knock virus out. Vaccines finishing it. 

The media pushing narrative gives illusion vaccines factor plays killing virus. wrong. country excellent job suppressing virus early vaccines come finish virus way earlier. Canada fully vaccinated September. even need be. virus curtailed April/May. guess economy going quasi ineffective everyone else lockdown... History shown adult humans pretty good judging risks, adapt behaviors depending perception risk.

The major difficulty current risk environment government lied us, strenuously repeatedly, point government lost credibility. Honest question corona crazies, would need see fully support going back normal? 100% vaccination? Absolutely zero cases? reducing hospitalisations 80s 4 weeks single dose yes.

Both good whole ""better"" thing situations bit pointless.

AZ clearly strong reducing deaths original UK variant. interesting much AZ reduces transmission/infection (even trials monkey evidence AZ's vaccine fully prevent infection/transmission). thing something worry later, countries look open travel remove restrictions. 

For single important thing protecting vulnerable reducing death count near zero out, AZ clearly perfect Here's another paper's coverage story. mean, second successful country vaccination Europe right now? types virus less stable others prone mutations replicate. Influenza notorious mutating often. population old. Young ones depressed. Cut slack. article refers Israel proper. Nothing Israel's reopening anything Palestinians living WB Gaza. Whether businesses schools PA remain open closed decision Palestinian government, Israel. whether Israeli businesses schools remain open closed effect Palestinians living outside Israel proper, participate institutions regardless COVID. Palestinians WB work Israel vaccinated Israel, \~2m Palestinians Israeli citizens permanent residents access vaccines every Israeli.

I agree poster ‚Äî read article, clearly misunderstood means. Fantastic news , feel great deal shame anti AZ politicians comments, may cost lives, sad people. could also say ""america gotten people covid one day canada total""


well, literally, get it.  help lot European leaders openly disparaging it.

Like Macron example claiming ['quasi elderly. Probably best thing say country antivax developed world. Ireland here... what's vaccine? Bingoooo! variants! variants! Whatever shall do! get point goal rules extend pandemic, flatten curve. Life short. choose prioritize family people actually want see me, nothing wrong that. OP choose wait around maybe person change tune point wait maybe? OP clearly important friend ultimately bother? England data released next hours 10x sample size. we‚Äôll get see soon cure giving people back lives. Everything else bandaid. It\`s big nerds stay inside time. Since virus going go away time soon, going market vaccines better current mRNA vaccines. open sweden 10x death rate closed Norway Finland. back normal right now? fat lady yet sung. over. vaccine-escaping mutant virus, may getting close, over. ""we"" mean Trump adminstration. agree, Israeli Arab wish non Israelis brothers get soon read earlier. talked holidays increased travel cause. Shouldn‚Äôt cases Christmas decreasing now? One dose weeks, yes. England releasing data hours 10x (already large) sample size, we‚Äôll know lot Formative experiences called formative reason. like 10 bucks? Covid survive stomach, bacterial food bourn illness. wash hands may touch face. Source health podcast listen to, worried this. insane see people rooting vaccine, literally cheering virus killed millions. Especially vaccine sold profit likely end vaccine much developing world.

&amp;#x200B;

Also surreal see reddit (who generally quite big-pharma corporate greed) cheer Pfizer vaccine, company looking profit pandemic poor record conduct, non-profit AZ alternative seems America hogged vaccines left everyone else scrambling get some. two things often interchangeable. I've got collection cube one thing have! lol

Honestly little plastic fidget cube. gives variety things play with! many policies assumed US would take account Canadian interests

Not case. Worldwide cases February 21th 2021 lowest since July 15th 2020, way less PCRs done. Like atalein says, mild flu season. also strong trend fewer mortalities last couple years. offense, I'm looking forward unsubscribing sub. I'm scheduled get vax next week! Yep, may run time. vaccination warmer weather even UK variant 30-60% infections end March Rt may still 1. 

Based 10% UK 90% various original variants overall Rt 0.8 would expect Rt UK variant 1.15 (assuming 50% infectious). 

It's question think could vaccinate 10% per month. plus benefit seasonality would never expect Rt rise significantly 1 even UK variant becomes dominate. True - Denmark Norway beat first wave without masks. Ok, example, flu season basically nonexistent many places. That‚Äôs huge cause death missing numbers. Irrelevant board, full bunch virgins ;) 8% higher expected, thought like 5%. 8% high. strange 10%: Slightly less 100 000 people die year Sweden. 12000 Covid mortalities large portion old frail people. Somewhere (very roughly) around half people would, statistically, died anyway. Data analysed Public Health England (PHE) shows Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine provides high levels protection infection symptomatic disease first dose.

Early data PHE‚Äôs SIREN study shows promising impact infection healthcare workers aged 65. Healthcare workers study tested coronavirus (COVID-19) every 2 weeks ‚Äì whether symptoms.

Data shows one dose reduces risk catching infection 70%, rising 85% second dose. suggests vaccine may also help interrupt virus transmission, cannot spread virus infection.

PHE‚Äôs analysis routine testing data also shows one dose 57% effective symptomatic COVID-19 disease aged 80. effect occurs 3 4 weeks first dose.

Early data suggests second dose 80s improves protection symptomatic disease 30%, 85%.

Hospitalisation deaths rates falling age groups ‚Äì oldest age groups seeing fastest decline since peak mid-January.

Early data suggests vaccinated people go become infected far less likely die hospitalised. Overall, hospitalisation death COVID-19 reduced 75% received dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The risk dying aged 80 less half (56%) vaccinated cases compared unvaccinated cases, least 14 days receiving first dose.

Those 80 develop COVID-19 infection vaccination around 40% less likely hospitalised someone infection vaccinated.

These high levels protection also seen variant concern (B.1.1.7) first identified South East England December 2020.

While data infection, hospitalisation death promising, PHE continue observe trends closely coming months ensure firmer conclusions made.

PHE also monitoring real-world impact AstraZeneca vaccine publish findings due course ‚Äì early signals data suggest it‚Äôs providing good levels protection first dose.

Dr Mary Ramsay, Head Immunisation PHE, said:

This strong evidence Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine stopping people getting infected, also protecting cases hospitalisation death. see much data coming weeks months encouraged initial findings.

But protection complete, don‚Äôt yet know much vaccines reduce risk passing COVID-19 onto others. even vaccinated, really important continue act like virus, practice good hand hygiene stay home.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said:

This crucial report shows vaccines working ‚Äì extremely encouraging see evidence Pfizer vaccine offers high degree protection coronavirus.

Vaccines save lives, vital roll vaccine programme fast possible, many people possible take jab. new evidence shows jab protects you, protects around you.

It important see much evidence possible vaccine‚Äôs impact protection transmission, continue publish evidence gather it. roll jab, vital people continue play role protecting NHS sticking rules.

This data shows clear protection first dose, particularly severe disease, supporting decision maximise number people vaccinated single dose, advised Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI).

The current dosing strategy save lives ensuring people receive protection severe disease following first dose.

There also good evidence suggesting giving second dose AstraZeneca later lead much higher levels protection. Offering booster 12 weeks therefore help ensure longer lasting protection beyond current restrictions. That's nearly every state plan. Makes wonder they'll deal that. ""Readily available"" means driving home say ""crap! forgot get vaccine yesterday. i'll stop now..."" also dropped dramatically states time period too. think midwest states celebrate thanksgiving christmas? culture large personal space little physical contact.

I would bet things normal except travel large scale music festivals Yes, already looks like they're starting downward trend. thought gyms already open? could Italy better less?

I guess weekend October 10th even bigger holiday Thanksgiving. Temporarily, yes.  think Fauci put talk overdrive yesterday intentionally downer. interviews multiple times per day. knows people parse every word. knows going asked getting back normal.

There days media reports saying ""cases declining!"" ""another expert says may approaching herd immunity!"" Fauci, wanting public get excited, pissed everybody's Cheerios. Everybody read comment ""its possible we'll wearing masks"" 2022 air let balloon. Tough crowd Good observation, bet image eye catching generates views It‚Äôs kinda focusing wrong thing, I‚Äôm saying keep eye talk variants avoiding protection vaccine, reality cases dropping everywhere around world. Last month fear U.K. variant going become dominant strain U.S. lead 4th wave haven‚Äôt seen.

Again I‚Äôm saying stuff isn‚Äôt stuff watch see new waves Covid hitting countries S. African strain resistant natural immunity vaccines, I‚Äôm personally gonna lose sleep Why? Take EU commission sabotaging deal chances early production. variants responsible sudden outbreak Newfoundland? I'm sure lived Japan spoke German, trouble speaking government officials well.

If going live country, learn language. worldview literally indefensible.

""Yes need lose family-owned-for-5-generations business fight pandemic EMERGENCY. No, CAN'T ask nurses work 1 extra day per month vaccinate people pandemic - relaxation IMPORTANT.""

Your decision-making process emotional irrational. Simply last time started lifting restrictions massive new peak. statistical evidence reinfection major threat, particularly UK strain. Sorry hear experience, everyone‚Äôs body reacts differently. 

COVID seen hide people‚Äôs fat deposits dormant later. people also got reinfected poor antibody response, seems exceedingly rare, I‚Äôd caution avoid drawing conclusions extrapolating personal experience.

This virus worth fear over. plague, you‚Äôre right, implying deaths negligible wrong. Precautions need taken everyone.  Unless I‚Äôm really trouble morning, 85% 94%? Second-grade vaccine

It's proved better preventing hospitalisations Pfizer jab I'm curious grade give one? really becoming dominant really seeing impact R value. 


It's R(t) low right adding 10% variant spreads 30-50% faster push \*that\* high, 0.8. entire population never vaccinated. perfect world ever happen. private company making important legislative decision affect every aspect life. required show order get food employment completely controlled private entity public input. evidence become international ID yet another regulatory body government oversight public input. Without oversight nothing stopping company changing status reason sees fit it'll also sold lowest bidder terms protection hackers likely compromised can't use evidence logic talk someone position used neither evidence logic reach. Yes trials concluded around thanksgiving spike 1 1000 people dead one year significant. said one reason. reason. vaccinating people would end hospital catch COVID. I've never gotten one flu vaccine year. assume taking multiple vaccines produce antibodies actually taking multiple vaccines completely different antibodies? think purposeful misinformation public health folks keep people already post-covid/immune social distancing wearing mask.

Sorta like ‚Äúmask don‚Äôt work‚Äù put keep masks available hospitals. miss opportunity get vaccinated. Yup, pandemic measures end eventually - risk group gets vaccinated, risk hospitals collapsing disappears, life moves on. 

Good see much needed optimism üëç Yeah, I'm desperate get official estimate we're stopping mask wearing year. agreeing guy- definitely seeing significant drops, variants definitely means keep covid news cycle going. 

Take look Newfoundland seen crazy spike cases last week two, largely due increased contagiousness newly introduced variant. (They getting like 0-4 new cases day weeks suddenly got 30 50 100 cases consecutive days) 

Yes Canada improving means fear lingering variant it‚Äôs significance downplayed. pick worst photos. man mask incorrectly vaccine isn‚Äôt painful.

But yes, May things could well much much better. Thank response (:

So understand correctly: nordic countries might slightly better comparison, people want discredit sweden's strategy tendency making bad-faith arguments sweden compared nordics. seeing repeated enough times people get sick it? imho ignoring gap policy behavior, varies according many factors culture, context politics. Consider something simple mask mandate, could compare asian countries european ones US?

The point credit card cell phone data measure behavior changes led changes transmission starting point. Policy derivative. Two separate points need considered: (1) change behavior led change desired outcome (2) change policy led change desired behavior. 

Not expert means, open convinced study addressed issue.

I trying suggest credit card studies perfectly measure anything, course also mention means. Merely examples think would meaningful comparing rule changes. must b guy make real one now. understand compare Sweden Scandinavian countries NZ/Taiwan. 

You cannot, however, compare Sweden European nation North America/South America. narrative ""Sweden bad"" shatters lockdown bros need re-affirmation time willingly spend basements. Cuz AOC gonna forgive anyway becomes president. downside!

Together said general attitude towards society others, able fight pandemic better. place time Covid cases single digits everyone wore masks followed proper etiquette guidelines lockdowns. one complained, natural wear mask going outside, simple that, even question.

I agree though mask alone solve problem, ridiculous assume successful it. act wearing mask general attitude towards collectivism thinking others comes wearing mask really helped stopping spread virus. 10%-70% general efficacy means AZ suitable achieve herd immunity. Period. admission situation would involve providing real evidence thing exists. example sample genome virus could verified direct ancestor sars-cov-2 by

Good lord go outside stop worrying politics. Biden president. Trump not. Stop letting conspiracy nuts drive insane. life worrying former president. it‚Äôs interesting. haven‚Äôt determined effect heart damage due Covid life expectancy yet I‚Äôm sure actuaries working ignoring look total excess death. treating like year flu season. give special status count excess death. 

There's many ways countries twist data start trying adjust stuff. That's travel restrictions for. No, think that. everyone snippy? stricter gathering rules Sweden Europe late spring summer way autumn. Sweden 50-people gathering limit put place first wave considering removing October, delayed raise infections, made 10-people gathering limit winter. 

Most European countries stricter cases measures spring, dropped May started instituting back wave already started again.  social habits study India necessarily applicable rest world either. call partner ""it"" told required partner? kidding.

Once June came realized going stretch fall, holidays, spring, Summer, it. know annoying wearing mask? Putting people believe them. Personally knowing people damn family love trump think situation fake. Staying home year explaining kids friends can't play though kids play together. depressing frustrating put people would rather want rather think ""views"" right. No, there's science denial. shit ia gotten bad lots people made choices made worse. looking impact transmission, it‚Äôs useful tool compare secondary effects taking action. example, article shows closing schools large impact transmission, worth secondary effects flushing year+ education toilet isolating millions children socially developmental years? started rise . Well Cuomo among said last September/October would trust FDA approved vaccine simply might politically positive white house. contributed anti-vax crap see now. none govs would ""gold"" standard. Agreed.  However, really appropriate use comparison event world war event modern pandemic.

Doing result practice used shape public opinion 1985 present. anti-war fervor Vietnam war died down, voting public consisted lot baby boomers whose parents fought World War II therefore positive response comparison.

US politicians long known wars associated rhetoric used hide problems divert attention, disgusting needs stop.

Media needs get habit well. Testing specific new variant harder obviously done new. point easier start giving see real world results. cited source later comment. know full. However, one-day outdoor festivals planned summer. know indoor concerts happening anytime soon, LA outdoor venues thankfully near perfect weather year-round. bigger issue national tours take time plan might take risk. still see one-off outdoor events going forward summer. Hollywood Bowl particular perfect socially distanced concerts way set concerts listed website spring/summer. should‚Äôve opened 10 months ago? No, all, crux matter. boils question wether trust China accurately report data. you? Yes. That‚Äôs works. world entirely based reactions, huge amounts people work emergency response sorts situations like know situations possibility, likelihood.

I work disaster response. run drills exercises like time. multiple companies state, alone, regularly practices disasters one happen, they‚Äôre prepared.

This bad conspiracy theory. wish media smear campaign Oxford AZ BTW non-profit duration pandemic. Love reading real world data like this. link results published Uni. Edinburgh.

490,000 people real world trial, single injection, 94%. Oxford referring countries vaccination policy. also Jewish appreciate baseless liable hate speech me. How's French vaccine coming along? medical student wondering getting replies have.  lot people bad quantifying risk well weighing downsides virus vs personal economic impact people's live. took hard line March ""never risk getting Covid circumstances"" worst take time. But, things changed. effective vaccine combined fact Covid likely remain form another. People acting like 95% efficacy vaccine somehow good enough STILL CHANCE. Yes, large scale risk really look like everyone wants vaccine taken it. looks like blip compared past winter starts come line every days risks (or lower). 10% SA 70% general efficacy II phase trial = second grade.

Unsuitable herd immunity. AZ doomed live lockdown

86% mess, manipulation incompetence AZ. 

BioNTech vaccine better, pure AZ every aspect. EVERY ASPECT.

Free long term effects. Allow re-vaccination time. adopted strain 6 weeks. Nah ass hole pans  making stuff goalposts place, unfortunately. Trying decide restaurants I‚Äôm going eat Friday celebrate one week second shot, peace mind go normal stuff again.

Also really looking forward going back gym. mean, good parts covid, obviously. Everyone knows without side effects make sure make clear paperwork even nurse administering vaccine made clear me. also luck draw seems gets side effects doesn't.

I 2 days, feel 100% 5th day. 25 years old, took Pfizer. Mom got me, felt nothing. Everyone else know got also side effects. either get lucky someone high risk, vaccine less fatal covid i'd rather take chance virus itself. feel much better tomorrow. shot made feel 2 days after. super bad, noticeable cares? Even BoJo said cases rise hospitalisations still declining matter. Wdym I've never heard this. It‚Äôs especially sad many leading killers prevented reversed government spends 1 cent every dollar prevention compared treatment. sad frustrating don‚Äôt focus preventing chronic diseases instead focus solely treatment it‚Äôs often far late. numbers released today due afternoon. exactly get point one wearing masks? agree, merely refuting one active goal spreading this, demonstrably false. Like Pfizer make profit charging EU countries [extra get bottle though. gathering limit public events like concerts, sports audience's. apply private work settings. (Even though also tried limiting contact ofc.) 
I believe European measures far encompassing Sweden's. Might productive enter manufacturing arrangement already approved vaccine. article UK Nice! Soon power level increase Thomas Jefferson owned 600 slaves slavery protected first article constitution, first order business priority. I'm going acknowledge rest feel I've adequately shown laughable nonsense is. Yes... I‚Äôm ok gets people vacation. Maybe wishful thinking since favorite people world South Africa England I'm stuck US, see staying completely cut rest world people vaccinated. England vaccinating quickly cases SA low, despite variant. (Don't know anything Brazil.)

I think might see lot countries requiring proof vaccination non-quarantined entry, however. could deal that. This, kids, need strong state regulation even ownership strategical sectors. something serious, like say, pandemic, happens, one big pharma companies can't hold government balls, treat contracts mere suggestions keep blackmailing public. Recommendations one thing mandate would definitely still count restriction lockdowns last one day absolutely necessary. Hopefully, way things going vaccine rollout, finally end restrictions April. good enough. Ireland delay gyms even longer suppose. Exactly people Texas going drinking constantly whole entire time. 

Somethings happening it‚Äôs obvious Science win. save planet.

Less infections, less mutations hopefully ready next time. 

Maybe we'll struggling remember nightmare 2020 decade except died. 9/11 twenty year anniversary year, we've already forgotten despite nightmare crime committed afterwards. Nobody going put indefinite mask wearing becomes endemic. uk dont get told. Get given turn up. dont think anyone gives damn though. want done with. Thank you.

It‚Äôs infuriating. want get vaccinate get it. I'm watching room getting first dose Pfizers vaccine (: I'm excited. Thank you. mean only, 20k vaccines mean nothing. vaccinate local authorities fat cats business insurance medical insurance seems. go fantastic snd selective school 3.9 GPA. actually wonderful science programs boyfriend STEM major here! everyone wants STEM dude. would without teachers? 

I‚Äôm good numbers, would go banking? It‚Äôs fuckup double major things like career I‚Äôll like? It‚Äôs fuckup go prestigious private school offered scholarships desperately need?

Something tells mommy daddy paid college don‚Äôt see value anything STEM. fucking privileged can‚Äôt even see it. confusing. Everyone claims something different. proper studies? 2-3 million estimates we're probably crazy far target. Thought closed way that...at least tier were. PIT referring copy pasted definitions, essentially saying trust China's scientists completely impartial, objective, free political influence? (Since one's provided ""scientific observations"" international component investigation) dependent filing 2020 get stimulus check tax return People US shoot favorite football team loses lmao great news glory hole users.  Mate, psst, shit argument stick anymore - contract leaked narrative UK govt got busted. Yeah, full export ban, nothing else.

No better deal, early contract, nothing, allowing private company export. would guessed, right? I'm starting really hate ""zero covid"" people. becoming cult. made term woke/progressives trying change spanish force hispanics. Despite fact 76% hispanics never heard it, 3% use it, 20% heard still use it.
    split vaccine type? miss something? people *around world* would posion family member $200k

FTFY AZ ""Quasi-ineffective"" vaccine I'm still trying catch covid. Like let people house, take shower change clothes work (teacher) levels trying get it. cannot believe number healthy, level headed people I've talked like, ""::shrug::, get it, get it"". read potential long term impacts all? terrifies covid vascular nature, appears able impact major organs. even know extent damage? feel like scratching surface. That‚Äôs one followed lock orders. doesn‚Äôt work one cares Same. used keep inhaler emergencies only. use least day. ever look AZ data? small studies, different regions, different dosage, different time regimes. Total mess compared others. accurate honest, things never quite go back way before.

And not.  complacent many businesses put profit health safety.  That's going change. I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôll still wear masks. It‚Äôs going magically disappear it‚Äôll turn regular flu occurrence much danger hide till vaccinated believe Gomes didn‚Äôt include seasonality paper. providing update soon.    SHIT Never mind then. You‚Äôve already made enough fuckups extra lap won‚Äôt save you. went good school scam private school least try save hail marry go investment banking management consulting. I‚Äôm starting think school doesn‚Äôt lot that... store yesterday saw sign along lines ‚Äúhelp slow spread‚Äù. think smart messaging use ‚Äúslow‚Äù instead ‚Äústop‚Äù. 

If think masks ‚Äústop‚Äù spread, you‚Äôre likely pass judgement someone think isn‚Äôt using correctly. guess. 

Please don‚Äôt start debate whether work not. I‚Äôm looking messaging people interpret respond it. already six Quote EMA report

""There yet enough results older participants (over 55 years old) provide figure well vaccine work group. However, protection expected, given immune response seen age group based experience vaccines; reliable information safety population, EMA‚Äôs scientific experts considered vaccine used older adults.""

This Italy choose give 55 older, Germany Spain e.g. decided set limit 65. group 65 older 2 infections total, one vaccination group one control group. African American Hispanic children likely live multi generational homes grandparents, may one reason families choose stay remote. Cuomo disaster beginning. knew nursing home stuff quite ago. I‚Äôm spreading misinformation. didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄòCovid HI 20%‚Äô said scientists argue. 
An extract Gomes‚Äô page university Warwick professor. 
‚Äúin last 20 years research activity primarily involved mathematical modelling infectious disease dynamics epidemiology. last 10 years, became increasingly appreciative need build promote new infectious disease epidemiology theory account individual variation characteristics selection pressure‚Äù 
Sounds pretty relevant discussion around cases plunged *checks notes* around 30% natural infection. reasonable public health argument behind decision would acceptable. Florida situation public health reason given. sounded like governor arranged special vaccination site political donor/supporter. public health argument governor county administrators involved offered essentially happy least someone getting vaccine. 

Then came one county government administrators involved setup ""VIP"" list vaccines included despite fact qualified current vaccine rules apply everyone else state. might look crazy ayyyy don‚Äôt covid! Lol way, furloughed without pay living charity stimulus/unemployment came stressful part 2020. obviously watched enough true crime shows. People kill family members staggeringly small amounts insurance money. sister knocked days second dose well. Again, acknowledge sound like dick, wasn‚Äôt pre-prepared rant. person peddling conspiracy theory, plain simply. describing ‚Äúmedia misinformation campaign‚Äù purpose profit zero evidence. 

You‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm sick it. particular post somewhat breaking point. We‚Äôve become society immediately jumps conspiracy theory reasonable explanations. may dick, stand dickishness. Whether intentional not, claiming mass media disinformation campaign anti-vax BS core. I‚Äôve seen 1-3 days. teachers keep saying kids need get priority vaccination start again.  Ooops. respect him, one anti-Fauci people here, seems like always pushes overly cautious, can't let guard take. assume rather take chances people misinterpreting optimistic predictions green light act like over. Eventually, he'll drift background (he position coronavirus hit vast majority country idea since never news) cases low enough things closer functioning like pandemic. lol guess we'll find couple weeks think ended opposite care homes used AZ arguably risk group. lot frontline staff got vaccine early got lot Pfizer vaccine. thought graph interesting one citation insults Viruses don‚Äôt burn themselves. needs external force like widespread immunity quarantine protocols place slow down. AZ rescue, glad got mine early on, second dose 3 weeks x bird flu spread birds humans Russia. post almost got 100k upvotes people panic covid 2.0 drop dead! trying find laymans explanation differences efficacy calculation trials able to.  know description measured infection included figures? hard evaluate purely country country basis, interconnected everything is. People traveling Christmas one country impact rates several countries over. 

A slower spread NYC, could mean someone airport Lagos less likely get it. nice, payment form tax dollars. pharma companies completely protected payouts taxpayer funded. Biden done great job, Trump pretty much 1 million vaccinations per day, increasing greatly biden took office. Aus NZ? know place entire world get Zero cases next decade. Bird flu? comment first time hear Totally feel you. Never idea kids year plus limiting social interaction (and ruining relationship thought would man) makes feel like I‚Äôm starting run time.

Thank god women modern world freezing eggs viable choice. giant PR gift kid Austria everyone remembered US fondly GIs handed candy kids Soviet troops know aggression.

Decades friends relatives 300 million doses remember China champion poor.

Whether believe accurate interpretation facts, that's story that's going stick.  Its‚Äôs new covid!!!1!!üò≤üò≤üò≤ also check everyone make sure N95 masks properly fitted, touch bare hands?

So ridiculous. Seems like German government can't shake totalitarian tendencies. so? know right people? Nobody know who‚Äôs symptoms. 2 dead Fauci use wording well apologized for. concerned 3 month delay tactic proven likely say wrong back strategy.

It way media creating drama sake drama. July first question 
October last question. 
Those milestones Fauci looking fwd always US fault. West Virginia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska given doses per capita states. product small state population. That's all. 

Texas given fraction vaccine per capita. Let's cut WV supplies half see effective compared states. Maybe people weren‚Äôt flying consistently traveling internationally easily needed speak trump administration (I know couldn't), kinda wish would stop talking much lol Can't wait CNN write articles ""Peruvian Variant may hitting US shores winter.""  still going strong? curious. know two people early thirties decided move men dating start pandemic-- relationships crashed burned pretty hard. figure risk works either very, well. badly lol.  link science based epidemiology says exit faster pace?

The exit strategy based politics/optics goals are. overall goal lessen burden healthcare system, reduce deaths, goals way met. government says easing depend vaccines proving effective lowering hospitalization deaths, **infection rates remaining low new virus variants emerging throw plans disarray.**

-looks like moving goalpoasts me, items bold. Lower deaths hospitalizations top priority Interesting

It's whenever I've seen reports images coming Florida looks covid never happened Neoprene suit holes J&amp;J weeks away, i'm going say mid June. whether they'll take i'm sure. many teens get HPV shot? age bracket likely complications mono flu covid. Put Oxygen mask first, help around you. felt gross (fever, headache, cramps, sore arm) day shot. got mine Saturday too, felt fine Monday morning. thing lasted longer sore arm, took another two days. Well obviously, dad vaccine get admitted hospital Scotland. lives Wales. Let make abundantly clear: Yes. good reason skip vaccine, selfish one. ""I'm one 1 500k people serious allergic reaction vaccines."" want get it, businesses refuse service. I've lost many people plague many young coworkers struggling recover COVID sympathy ""My ability know-it-all important literally everyone else's health.""

Don't dumbass. think restrictions vs restrictions people's willingness follow guidelines. California seems strict rules corona, yet videos posted last year show one cares. still see thousands gathered car shows I'm willing pay pfizer's vaccine. sinovac others, mRNA exciting. Yeah. Ensuring terrorists easy access vaccine high priority me. Get rid Hamas stop teaching kids kill Jews children's television shows maybe I'll start caring. country obligation people....what else US gonna do? money going vaccinate. Sure made fun gonna give vaccines. 

Blaming US good vaccinating money buy like getting mad someone addicted drugs instead person selling drugs, source problem dealer lack sufficient help addicts, problem fast manufacture distribute vaccines. 

We need boost production, production shortages distribution shortages. issue. US finally something get vaccines people.

If nation's leader purposely choosing get vaccines nations it, nations citizens die...they would lose next election. read it, I'm assuming lots potential flaws study carried out. course linked jab they've gone down, however, 85% reduction coronavirus hospitalization admissions first lockdown.  
It's jabs alone caused it, studies giving statistics might slightly biased efficiency. Jesus panic around bird flu annoying understand frustrated going generational warfare angle wrong take imo. economy screwed actually taken responsibility suppressed pandemic early, instead running around yelling can't possibly afford shut economy., anyway realized things completely control ended way economic damage shutdowns year would we'd bit bullet done needed control one shot. Plus, letting run wild keep things open going hurt jobs young whether makes sick, severe effects lot people 45 (around 20% deaths ages 45-64 CDC data). There's high chance boss boss's boss age category, place work probably going keep running hunky dory management gets hospitalized dies. young person can't say ""it's problem""; society connected complex ways consequences dealing going touch sure. 

Also, I'll add politicians elite set policy ignores things important ones getting hurt mostly. ways keep safe help recover (see White House outbreaks). people dying mostly innocent bystanders, often poor minorities, thinking let old people suffer kind revenge bad boomer policies, attacking entirely wrong people. Earliest - May 1

For sure- June Here's one October: means death rate COVID 4-8x lower ""death % = deaths / confirmed cases"" metric. literally &lt;1%, lol. we're still shut down... That's reporting works. people test positive every day infected ones tested positive ~5 days earlier. slight decline reproductive rate holidays, tremendous decline reporting day Jan 12. believe every state restrictions point, certain degree. restrictions work much people follow them, well. test hypothesis:

1. Vaccination driver, countries low vaccination rates dramatic decline. correct, even low vaccination rate countries like Mexico Canada seeing case decreases dramatically. think we'll see vaccine effects deaths/100k sooner cases/100k, vacines much immediate effect (Risk population vaccinated sooner times \~100% death reduction).
2. preventive measures working, regions higher adherence also seeing sharpest decline. TN vs. CA seem show that's also main driver, although CA sharper drop.
3. temperature/Sun exposure (Vitamin D) culprit, southern vs. norther hemisphere rates different. Argentina India seeing sharp drops, that's either. 
4. reason.

I think 4, support 1 2. Uncoupling variables interesting problem one expertise data unravel. could think reasons rates changing:

* Westernized countries LOT Holidays+Traveling November December. contagions occur types gatherings, gatherings mainly stopped uncoupling main driver return system steady state while.
* % population dgaf restrictions another % strict them. there's significant interaction populations (nonadherent living adherent), kind effectively means two populations. Say 30% nonadherent population 1M, means 300K people infection rampant 70% exposed infection. example, nearby town 1M people, 3k people died. 30% 1M 300K, 1% death rate particular town, that's 3k. could seeing virus starving ""infectable"" population nonadherent survivors reach natural immunity.
* Lack interest + better care. young, mild symptoms there's cost positive covid test (cost tests, isolation, reduced earnings, social shaming), might care get tested would self-isolate even dgaf. increase test positivity, sick people get test. Better care due techniques/technology + ICU availability drive death rate down. looked positivity rates/death rate, might another reason reduced cases.

Someone data time make analysis probably already. human beings adaptable. like society ravaged war &amp; starvation like Europe WW2. one thing covid 10x fatal everyone knew someone died it. would shell-shocked hesitancy ingrained public psyche. I'm interested economic effects social distancing recovery/rebound, especially urban centers like SF. entire Bay Area like ghost town right now. completely deserted compared LA Seattle. feel bad students next 10-50 years read case studies lockdowns hahaha Unfortunately yes, EU decided pick fight lackluster efforts. Add anti UK spin, anti vax, state propaganda likes Russia China healthy dose shit journalism get misinformed Reddit loves get rage deaths easy count that's metric planning lower make look better. see many measures ""long covid"" heart issues strokes news, you? numbers much harder quantify place definitive blame virus. lower number makes headlines, suppress evidence outcomes disease. Fair enough. makes sense - experienced largely disruptive tragic/traumatic cultural moment. hope said done folks feel comfortable sliding back normalcy, whatever looks like them.

Luckily 18 months won‚Äôt hopefully come fall. Maybe, would helped didnt tell US population shouldnt wear masks. Hard lockdown. Illigal wear masks. possible 50% population based blood tests health insurance stats. Maybe surprising also know would actually work well. still important news. probably could clinical trials places won‚Äôt access vaccines anytime soon. article talk moderna excited happen. Yes, wear it, almost year still hate it. Oh man yeah it‚Äôs unfair high schoolers college kids getting yet another year taken away Polis Colorado done pretty damn good job. also think DeSantis FL made right call lift statewide restrictions back October, although ton people agree due polarization controversial move was. media definitely agree. me, results speak themselves, Florida today better IMO. sounds like awesome program. hope works. Even it‚Äôs ‚Äúmost normal people‚Äù think many come away pandemic lasting hypochondria agoraphobia. Among ready willing get back normal could still lingering anxiety depression 18 months reduced social interactions. Bu bu FuCk tORiES! Woahhh Jeremy Corbyn! science economics would surely say abandon lockdown immediately.

Can link science based epidemiology says exit faster pace? family chain giving workers one-time payment equivalent four hours pay receiving completed vaccination. Trader Joe's providing workers ""an additional 2 hours regular pay per dose taking time get vaccinated,"" according spokesperson company. really feel entitled tell everyone health vaccines 100% effective? course I'm selfish one, right? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think education system really put dent peoples' critical thinking skills. Awesome. one US EU look time time. like shows estimate locations vaccinated 70%. Maybe could add that: Seriously would wise get behind scenes point. outsider states US ever restrictions first place? blatantly false. hear this? No. trend downward underway long severe weather. Second Wave.... they've predicting since initial pandemic last March. would larger widespread initial surge. Spanish Flu century ago similar cycle. Keep mind pandemic 3rd Wave, hopefully widespread vaccinations minimized case covid, localized flare ups. Nearly everyone does. still die. see point Last day season's gonna great get watch thousands Fulham fans cheer relegate us (Newcastle) :( Funny England able make work, US can‚Äôt... Yep, US also major decline COVID metrics weeks winter weather. storms also hit around week ago, isn‚Äôt enough time start showing case counts. **The U.S. Making Harder Rest World Get COVID Vaccines** 

I need read article know Project Warp speed spent billions US tax dollars investing different researchers/manufacturers. wonder US researched funded get first dibs vaccine say Mozambique?

Man GTFOH woke BS. wish could suck huge dong. Sorry loss. AstraZeneca relies four partners Europe production. Belgium Netherlands, Italy Spain Ya, it‚Äôs /r/cfb statement pretty accurate epidemiology perspective. mean he's politician, he's taking opposite approach DT, ""pretend bad it'll get better."" Biden making less rosy predictions realistic (i.e 1M/vaccinations per day, we're gonna averaging 2-3M/day soon), claim victory moving forward. may like it, smart political Good job America minimal accepting large number deaths..... disturbing.

I agree trend good. Enforcing social distancing schools, restaurants, offices, planes, gyms literally means permanent capacity restrictions (that's *why* capacity restrictions first place - keep people distanced). That's pipe dream never going happen, it. I‚Äôm Alabama ICU we‚Äôve massive drop. holding admits days ER coding two three day, ICU 10 inpatients. don‚Äôt care why, I‚Äôm fucking ecstatic it‚Äôs like was. Thank much! never replied first wrote this, appreciate it! Finally got diagnosis yesterday. ‚Äúlucky‚Äù RF anti-CCP sky high, easy call. can‚Äôt believe long took go telling PCP small joint pain asking could something like RA now. go, haha CA nearly fatality rate cases per 100k Florida everything wide open they‚Äôre much older average population. benefit severe restrictions questionable. Nobody ever subbed here. toxic wasteland paranoia misinterpretation scientific studies data. best thing anyone could mental health stay here. countries lost half million people?

No also United States 3rd highest country population... used per capita... Wait isn‚Äôt r/collegebasketball politicians making us miserable lockdowns masks. can't even fun anymore. here. 90% redditors sub keep saying soon reduce hospitalizations deaths we'll get back normal, even everyone gets mild asymptomatic Covid. Reducing hospitalizations deaths important help prevent post Covid. need use vaccine actually stop spread, reduce severity infection. Yeah agree, think every country suffering learned lesson. think cool, since seems like vaccine tech improved quite bit, I‚Äôm optimistic future pandemic scenario might waayyy prepared (might wishful thinking it‚Äôs hope regardless) Yeah, he‚Äôs tough position. long making decisions based date numbers data, that‚Äôs really ask him. another side issue, wealthy countries also paying vaccine research &amp; developments well expansion production capacity. Without investments, countries complaining US hogging resources, wouldn‚Äôt vaccine (or certainly within 12 months epidemic).

It always going selfish game. country, especially one impacted covid US, blamed looking citizens....and that‚Äôs consider US also donating billions purchase vaccines countries pledging give away unused stock. Yes, followed Iran, Italy, South Korea early points each.

When US became largest source imported cases, pulled Israel closed world rather embarrassing Trump world stage like that. right thing do, though. Yes. faster get shots arms better be. need drag pandemic wait perfect rather good. surprised text received father yesterday letting know got second jab day. conversation around Christmas hesitant it/giving bogus conspiracy theories.

Told proud him. Yup. idiotic thing say people magically start caring orders happen again? Thats good. hope prematurely die. It‚Äôs true... met husband several best friends, along diverse friend group, extracurricular university activities aren‚Äôt available now. 

It honestly breaks heart students missing living res, moving house mates, part clubs sports campus jobs, so, much more. 

I hope things get better soon experiences aren‚Äôt forever gone potential growth college/uni. cusp? passed 500k last week. couple would pay let poison them. Confusing data blown typical exaggerated media headlines actual leaders spreading exaggeration/ misinformation. lay person sees something confusing data they‚Äôre likely freak spread ‚Äúrumor‚Äù vaccine bad. also think pfizer moderna first really set bar high people forgot original goals vaccine effectiveness. Washing hands around people sick easy? dude, want solution. want complain. terms epidemiology? maybe. terms economic social impact (which matter, despite sub thinks) US far better say UK long run. ""It'll Easter."" fair, think doctors general wary making absolute predictions anything *will* happen. wouldn‚Äôt kill Fauci bit reassuring, dude needs work bedside manner  It‚Äôs something admit address Way late, maybe full 100% normal reopening, think places 50-75% occupancy April. I‚Äôve seen every country full vaccine nationalists. UK I‚Äôve hearing non-stop propaganda AZ vaccine vaccines falls apart look bit more. What's French vaccine? haha nice really. PCR numbers dropped, would see significant step upon change numbers one two day drop. we've seen slope similar slope - essentially Farr's Law. ""zero covid"" people see mecha-Karens bots Twitter.

If anyone wants cryogenically freeze year 2300 maybe we'll close eradicating COVID welcome so. Chinese scientists releasing huge amounts data virus collected Jan-March 2020 CCP suddenly ordered halt publishing scientific research virus. I‚Äôm willing bet China already traced identified origin virus. never make data public makes government look bad. I‚Äôm sure right. It‚Äôs dramatic someone sitting calmly getting vaccinated. Well guess guys drinking kool aid. 

No - spread ‚Äúlike wildfire‚Äù among young people significant % already it. vaccines continue go even things opened. 

The point shouldn‚Äôt throw open doors get together, pace reopening insanely slow. think chew gum clap time. drive make trip one day, quarantine hand stay parents. wouldn‚Äôt exactly call misinformation. right data over-65s I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd happy proved wrong AZ release data. professional regulators jokes People said lives lost staying indoors stock market crash would greater virus itself. proves otherwise - way would half million deaths. 

This even consider people damaged life live effects - thousands them. understand pride local university‚Äôs accomplishments. frankly people insane. can‚Äôt put way ""He anxiety"" half sub probably

Sorry loss You‚Äôre correct. doesn‚Äôt mean stop transmission, infection. means reduction hospitalization. Scientists don‚Äôt know would yet. That‚Äôs still need wear mask even vaccination. sure I'm following line though. read NYT often enough know, saying criticize BJ trump out? trump feel free criticize BJ wouldnt? 

Like not, lot similarities johnson trump movements put power, NYT American Media thinks so. continue getting blackout drunk every night. welcome, everyone!!! Thanks. couple senior nursing homes zip code too. might put number higher. locking spread hospitals collapsing? Young people don‚Äôt need intensive care like old - old vaccines it‚Äôs good! guess two types anti maskers. happy they‚Äôre getting vaxed infuriating. scientific advice basis epidemiology. economics. psychology. seems like terrible idea. Summer. first question 


Fall second question. Every vaccine stops serious cases prevents hospitalisation there‚Äôs doubt that. issue lot sub worried effectiveness SA variant effectiveness overall What's incivil it? Jesus   think many countries saw China done crudely imitated late ineffectively without enough commitment population. think pandemic mid April reasons are:

1. vaccines
2. turd immunity
3. seasonality 
4. holiday travel vaccine designed make immune system attack proteins specific SARS-CoV-2, mean still manage get infected clear virus faster, destroys many cells process. First Mountain Mamas weird way think wearing glasses helps masks fit better since end using nose piece glasses seal top mask. glasses makeup never really touch face either. research showed that, non-medical people wear masks, wear properly follow proper mask protocol. know link reddit, Google able find research. Thank you! really wasn‚Äôt trying shit article itself, trying point title post silly mean true it‚Äôs effective overall given studies, it‚Äôs still great vaccine Social distancing masking lasted weeks 1918, I'd think reaction towards end Great War pandemic. overall point still stands I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs easy pie Japan though...

All said US something similar. ill. feels ill. someone copy article here? paywall everyone getting Pfizer/Moderna vaccines effective. We're probably another year two away everyone getting 95% effective vaccines, need coverage keep people safe. want part society, part we‚Äôre tired virus winning evolutionary Powerball drawings, damn well stop selling many tickets. stuff everyone‚Äôs tired hearing about, masks indoor gatherings rest it, also rolling effective vaccines quickly others aren‚Äôt sold profit either. They‚Äôre using money make vaccines became definition ""scientific observation"" science always consider accurate observations are. asked would believe data provided China's scientists politically sensitive matter would reliable data. goalposts. 

Enjoy day asking believe fewer restrictions Lombardy, would fared better? think anyone believes that.

lol guess read subreddit often. 1/3rd USA believes that. Lets honest here. got rid lump wood WH vaccine rollout fire. first house first kid delayed different point life. College, started, much harder delay. FDA approved so, vaccinate service workers? meant living alone homes? rates Sweden exceptionally high. runaway outbreaks among elder care facilities. fatalities per capita 11x neighbors, Norway Finland. would hope Sounds great paper. reality stuff rarely ever works out. Hell, I'm still waiting six months unemployment due COVID seen light day. wife died number years back part due fuck drug company, hard prove specifics actually quite arbitrary case, get goddamn dime. easy say ""we'll pay you"" practice nobody's gonna cut check much money without lot litigation. ignoring science science yet, significant amount preliminary data perfectly comfortable moving forward that. like wore mask peer reviewed data effective.

This virus terrible many people. economy collapsed lower class finally end site, still saying ""Nope, stay inside untill unconfirmed date able confirm every ounce data suggesting"".

Doing nothing consequences too.

Also point matters time. still 50k new cases yesterday instance. plan reopening vaccine stops spread. turns case plan B. That's unreasonable ask give people.

I swear people WANT pandemic never end. Sure, could say UK garden variety early COVID variant case loads would smaller drops maybe quicker, end result we're seeing reversals terms progress UK variant.

This eloquent way phrasing it, yeah.

I generally think worth worrying increasing total numbers near me. Yes. oil spill responses do, actually. They‚Äôll fly people around world coordinate deal multinational oil spill, even though oil spills far less likely international pandemic is.

There similar organizations‚Äîboth private governmental‚Äîthat practice regularly deal disasters. think conspiratorial, you‚Äôre literally last person planet realizes bad things happen future.

It‚Äôs like distrusting tow truck company wonder possibly could known car would break down.

This conspiracy stupid bad. I‚Äôm reading correctly, effect seen one dose Pfizer vaccine?

If so, that‚Äôs great news. may misinterpreting though. looking comments rank superspreader coughs HVAC infects air entire building, like case Asia? Wish could highlight this, I‚Äôm coins. way expressed things successfully showed (me) different perspective absolutely relevant. Thank you. think adults understand life moves much slower them. graduate college, longer fixed life milestones years tend blend together; assume lot people forget like young quickly things change exciting be. Missing year 19 much, much bigger deal missing year 32.
 
Source: I've recently promoted adult I'm already noticing sense time change Sounds perfectly safe go live life. Surely makes worse... everyone trusts anymore. Remember said masks didn‚Äôt work Dr. Fauci's opinion hard science I've never relied approval make decisions COVID mitigation. Scientists make judgements based know, still biased making judgements based poor research.

That said, far article concerned, places contact tracing utilized properly, churches indoor religious gatherings shown typical transmission sites COVID. Again, RISK CREATED EQUAL.

Dr. Fauci final judge COVID matters he's holy saint lot people make be. many people either make 2nd coming Jesus Satan incarnate he's another infectious disease expert. wrong things right others, people believe disbelieve others blindly.

Again, got ax grind care understand risk management works think, judging comment history, clearly do. arguing good faith clearly think I'm wet-behind-the-ears liberal worships ground Dr. Fauci walks on. spent months defending places like Sweden, God's sake, damn right I'm going defend things like open outdoor protests people actually taking safety precautions scientifically proven much safer anything done indoors.

That said, I'm done conversation. good day good life, brother. mean, it'll likely vaguely follow path, since US adults offered vaccine 31 July, UK. 

If anything, states begin easing restrictions like even sooner UK. wrap mind around half million people lost year pandemic breaks heart.

What cant wrap head around millions people rationalized away think really big deal. shattered heart. even year sh!t hit fan moment pushed coping talking points absolve us culpability. doctors HC professionals tend live?

who literally first people get shots?

what segment population likely high uptake? predict ages 21-25 able get vaccinated U.S.? 

And predict everyone wants vaccine double vaccinated by? Covaxin (Bharat Biotech partnered Ocugen Inc) soon enter markets help cause vaccinate everyone paid $3k get lasik surgery 2019.
I started wearing glasses COVID... there? Graph looks like cases continue trend. Im teacher, guarantee wearing masks September, since kids wont vaccinated. love it, havent sick year now, best thing happen public ed result something bad. based million vaccinations. 15% million really cases influenced 1 2 random variables. Id like get New Brunswick perspective. know Cortland Cronk didnt isolate (travelled around province symptoms waiting test results). doubt widespread mandates. Maybe hospitals. like probably good thing lol safe travel ? 

Gf wanted us drive Ohio Missouri see parents. hasn‚Äôt able see almost year half. 

Her Covid summer recovered. parents aren‚Äôt vaccinated never it. 

We unsure we‚Äôll Airbnb stay them. 

Would safe thing do? really think overlooked fact lockdown?.. received vaccination card Universities decades: ""We knowing studying dorm room optimal productivity, we're investing heavily libraries study spaces help achieve full potential"" 
 
Universities 2020/2021: ""Please take full courseload entirely dorm room. leave disciplinary action."" Hopefully right. think may overrepresented travel forums I've noticed quite them. Yeah UK situation really canary coalmine speak comes actually looks like broad population. Sure, could say UK garden variety early COVID variant case loads would smaller drops maybe quicker, end result we're seeing *reversals* terms progress UK variant.

If situation despite good vaccination rates, societal protective measures, etc. one variants still outpacing causing huge spike cases/deaths I'd say ""ok, problem"". is, see route leads Osterholm style ""hurricane"", matter possibilities entertain. sure it‚Äôs barrier move country try learn it‚Äôs language avoid 

I would expect struggle anywhere didn‚Äôt English it‚Äôs main dialect think purpose verify independently companies stand make money vaccine good. exactly point, could shitty even though companies claim aims verify claim UK mostly. Travel forums well. quite ""zero covids"" there. US practical. average settlement Throw hands?

I‚Äôm US that‚Äôs works state. sure are, always good start talking doctor see do. bizarre trials conducted differing standards efficacy rates directly compared. Teachers really priority vaccinations. Schools important everyone. wouldn‚Äôt worry quarantining. reports far indicate vaccinated people don‚Äôt transmit virus. Finally living positive positive test result. Getting mine soon possible I‚Äôve done part everything power gone extra mile year long. Neat see history presented.

PCR technically possible discovery Taq, required adding polymerase every thermal cycle thermal cycle destroyed polymerases used.

Kary Mullis' clever innovation less there's bacteria lives reproduces entire lifecycle 72 deg celsius even high 95 deg celsius, must polymerase stable working temperatures.

And, indeed, polymerase molecule Thermus aquaticus stable higher temps, allowing survive thermal cycling PCR.

This made far easier automate thermal cycling thus far cheaper scalable. slander aimed towards credible vaccine (especially EU leaders) creates distrust among populations. People already rejecting AZ vaccine backs certain leaders media EU said. Data showing vaccine effective slander towards potentially costing people lives. Yay! Got mine Saturday! weeks excess caution start living life Vaccinating teachers staff disease may help prevent interruptions in-person learning, prevent virus‚Äô spread schools protect at-risk employees, study said.

This seems like common sense. glad whole study demonstrate That's hoping, said morning CNBC. said virus seasonal likely restrictions masks winter. 

I hoping wrong. Try De Santis man [publicly threatened withhold vaccines communities criticized know he's proud, psychopath. seems like antisocial behavior antisocial personality. Reality Government could little combat virus. Even Lockdown Lite‚Ñ¢ people we're complaining like hell. can't imagine could apply much stricter measures without serious backlash.

I'm bias go work go home play video games, everyone comes lockdown.

Even good procurement distribution vaccine been, people still criticizing part response laughable. part point go ""They good"". ‚Äúthey‚Äù sentence refer ‚Äúthe kids‚Äù ‚Äúthe teachers‚Äù? Perhaps go sit in-person class social distancing subpar ventilation review vague pronouns seventh grader traded masks friend. vaccine covid19 well Another issue studies they‚Äôre self-reported. I‚Äôm willing bet lot people feeling fatigue right now. know haven‚Äôt covid Changing plan better plan. Belgium message moment basically ""meh, we'll wait weeks see happens"". frustrating. would it? Saying require lockdowns masks end year wrong. lie say everyone access vaccine, restrictions longer needed. sunshine flowing ass recognize current pace vaccination far exceeds pace virus spread. rainbows flowing ass recognize US forefront vaccine development production, today - envy much world. ""done worse country"" indeed. Corbyn's relevant John Major bud. Fuck yeah, brother. month now; got first dose. hope enjoy every minute return normalcy. found **all nine clusters involved ‚Äúless ideal‚Äù adherence social distancing recommendations.** Students sat **less 3 feet apart** and, many cases, virus‚Äô spread among students could spread small-group sessions, according study.‚Äù

Once again, everyone seeking put onus safety burden education entirely anyone else factors absolutely entirely within community control. would guarantee ventilation systems schools sub-par well (surprise: almost are). 

Don‚Äôt see ‚Äúlunches potlucks‚Äù study anywhere... bottom 10 among 200 countries bad. Really bad. countries worse third world countries. lot better that. BOB Lockdown 2027 Vietnam island quite success Yeah 40k lot, percentage pretty typical. That's 18% increase holidays. length time around early-mid November 100% increase (80k 170k). seems like spike me. Another side: wealthy countries also paying poorer country's doses foreign aid funding. I've telling people year mildly vindicating. Like, suddenly everyone's worried shit worry time. course, also made leaving house nightmare. One edges considerably sharper. Got sick yesterday line COVID test. haven‚Äôt lost taste smell, perpetual ‚Äúnap mouth‚Äù taste tongue. mild loss taste? potential side effects valid reason concerned. know all, would say. Acting like know what's best every individual feeling entitled (as actually admitted) view overrule view actual individual something can't comprehend. People's situations priorities different, think need start observing that. Oxford effective single dose Pfizer real world.its also cheaper stored fridge. make see good news all. essentially writing 2021 even though we're *checks notes* two months in.

I mean, holy shit. That's awful. made work yet, mind you. Yeah PTSD this. Mate touch reality eating much shit propaganda embarrassing I'll give hand...

Sanofi (a French company) working mRNA vaccine, worry not, actually starting manufacture BioNTech vaccine (made Germany) expect deliver 120million doses summer.

By way, Sanofi much capacity going manufacture vaccines J&amp;J, yeah that's massive - oh, J&amp;J manufacturing also Europe, ends Janssen.

Btw, even BioNTech making vaccines expect 750 million vaccines end 2021.

The amount stupidity allow realize massive EU vaccine production actually - France, Belgium, Itally, Germany, Spain, Netherlands vaccine game many decades - difference companies export global scale. **Europe exporting vaccines 30+ countries, including UK LOL** (the country export ban vaccines - yeah, ""success"" based export ban allow company move stock UK xD, accomplishment!).

EU dependent AZ, upfronted money, gave priority AZ, got defrauded fucked UK government export ban private company. That's Sanofi, apparently others, starting make BioNTech vaccines.

EU going full mRNA, made Europe. Nah judge Florida lmao. I've America times every state I've different way that's wondered applied way handled covid  stadiums used time. There‚Äôs seasons; many ballparks completely empty Oct-March; many NFL stadiums empty Feb-September. border shut long time anyway. Even effective vaccine, border shut heard immunity levels reached take long long time people trust AZ vaccine. Thank you! guess I‚Äôve head vaccine one thing like prevent positive news! 1,246 Illinois today! numbers extremely low can't remember last time happened. Maybe back October? amazing stuff, keep going Chicago! :D Why? like anyone. depends vaccine. order actually end pandemic need achieve herd immunity. [some available vaccines get us agree, team Oxford developed amazing vaccine. would've nice AZ overpromise production capacity, could least commit clear schedule. EU still know actually going deliver 40m doses pledged Q1. 

I understand need people white knight pharma company screwed everyone deliveries, UK included. 10 different none. Accuracy important. Also, UK pretty rich. worse too. M√©xico: hold tequila

I mean, seriously, least US vaccinated decent amount population.

M√©xico even vaccinated 5% we're begging vaccines countries. Depends demographic ask, kids 0-18 flu actually deadly. many. Like 10. Among rich countries probably #1. Sorry, read it? acting like read it... even though link study media link? 


Edit: Nothing I've said false far, I'd love someone prove wrong instead acting like they're well-literatured scientists based reading newspaper article. So, pretty much wear masks forever?

There‚Äôs way every single person eligible vaccinated. able know quickly people public vaccinated, unless think people wear sort identification? examples ones paid actors playing scenarios? Even though I'm feeling kinda hopeless, seeing people celebrate getting first second vaccines makes really happy. One step closer finally non-fear mongering article. makes hopeful!!! dishonest entire pandemic. understand it, makes impossible believe them. America ""culture identity"" save melting pot. immigrants here, brought us cultures one big stew. Thats people say second one America apply. even getting aside really want get strict culture identity horribly classist racist.... White landowning men original citizens mattered, etc... mom. appointment 2/17, got rescheduled 2/19, cancelled. They‚Äôre supposed call week reschedule (CVS). Everyone seems fine, desperate get vaccine. still make sense me. Infection spread touching surfaces contaminated virus, touch eat food that's contaminated, virus know case stop throats climb nasal passages take detour lungs....instead, touch eat food that's contaminated, virus forced travel straight stomachs stops detours allowed along way. Sorry, makes sense me. think actual panic order. BUT, think reason smaller virus outbreaks big deal taken seriously time, properly mitigated, thus stayed small ""no big deal"". main concern right resources (tracking mitigation) used coronavirus. I'm panicked even really concerned point, worry well we'll able effectively deal new stuff routinely pops up. numbers really tell anything themselves, need know number/proportion people vaccinated also. example 59 people Scotland vaccinated four weeks prior, numbers good. Yeah know guy responded about. got first dose vaccine world difference me. almost year barely stepped foot another building. second dose able get together vaccinated friends family again, finally. able eat restaurant. Go store instead curbside pickup *everything*. I'm excited.  says next December part pulling back holiday gatherings, also shutdowns.

I highly doubt people give another Christmas? I'm almost convinced AZ skepticism stems developed partly UK. soon came EU fucked order disinformation came eu nations. reason based facts certainly must reason. First dose reduces hospitalisation 90% 5% vulnerable unvaccinated still. 15% uncontrolled spread, plus full hospitalisation 50s spring. NHS overwhelmed. 

Lockdown 7s vaccinated, 70s. ultimately turned narrative . got tired fearmongering, especially guilt shaming. see point judging people harshly. Life hard enough is. 

 would put lockdown camp last July. office opened back kids went school. Today, happy living lockdown state.....because fine. 

Pandemic not, told would going work coming home everything fun got cancelled discouraged seeing friends family, thought died went hell. way acceptable anywhere. Yet questions asked want pack office building full people. anyone brain wonders mental health down. Biden proof anyone lying. believe impossible tell truth fiction case really proof anything. mean, suppose second really lab accident, believe could rely China admit this? Thanks info. interesting. Germany prohibited vaccination people 65 AZ. know many complaints vaccine? British public fine it? say stadiums would converted mass testing sites? idea trash think bolsters ideas broadly vaccinate based first dose basis at-risk communities nations foreseeable supply constraints. That, weed legal there. live Key West light restrictions books little enforcement (which difficult, different topic). Duval Street bars restaurants full people shoulder shoulder. Masks required walk places. Locals mostly staying home pretty hardcore, lots work massive numbers tourists here. IDK numbers worse among hospitality workers. 

We'll never know though, many tourists go home covid souvenir. know 3 covid deaths people came KW passed covid visiting. cluster tied senior citizens came anyway canceled event. I'm sure more. recently read doctor lost job health consequences COVID caused. another worry. makes sick enough ability work affected, might looking dire future. employer asked show pandemic might employer fires virus messes up. Exactly. We've restrictions California months now, barely consequences following them. They've taken away previously available options, still honor system bullshit like back April 2020.

People already taking seriously continued so, continued without consequences. complete dog pony show. Goes show utterly useless restrictions are.

There studies this, results look good. beginning look like current vaccines stop people rightfully diss AZ, Pfizer Moderna also delayed deliveries, unlike AZ, charge fortune per dose, mention did, pathetic evil mafia guy move.

Once again: yet heard recipients Russian Chinese vaccines complain contracts torn apart, overcharged even explicitly extorted 

I care much 5% difference called efficiency whatever. one biggest rivers public money flowing corporations history. deserve able hold account. may noticed something vaccine rollout going actually going incredibly well!

This summer like last summer vaccine

This needs last lockdown Except people downvoting suggestion Norway may better comparable Sweden Albania. That's disgusting analogy 86% efficacy. 94% effective preventing hospitalisation. 650k given Pfizer, 490k given AZ.

AZ primarily given older people care home residents, Pfizer primarily used younger people. literally went super bowl. president couldn‚Äôt speak sensibly many years. Anything major upgrade perhaps OMG. I'm sorry going that. know neurons problems. hope get better soon. According Bill Gates ought enough anyone. feel dude. bunch bullshit. Damaging entire generation children save sick old people obese dying anyway. I‚Äôve lost hope society. üò¢ ""a capital building policy"" cover ""risk death"" only? fact China travel ""ban"" weak ban easily circumvented strengthens point. undercut it. don‚Äôt think speculate like don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre agreement. top epidemiologists would make similar recommendations. See Angie Rasmussen Michael Osterholm. Gyms shops reopen, fuck want meet friends wait rate falls instituted restrictions? always snowing. never stops. want spring bad. 9th, that's include 2 densely populated microstates, really fully urban therefore always prone higher average death rate.

So 7th really. worst. pretty bad road map shows restrictions lifted June. Can't fucking wait, I'm thankful scientists created vaccines! know classes Saturdays Sundays? wouldn‚Äôt classes M-F? Send one dollar Happy Dude mean would say definitely start then. I‚Äôm agreeing general idea though Sorry plight. mean honestly. I'm saying ""This group worse you. Stop complaining."" I'm saying burden young. burden across board.

I worked way low income too, college, told would never again. Scrimped saved, making considerable progress, couple significant setbacks along way, making progress starting feel like could actually retire I'm dead. COVID hit. kids suffer this.

This entire society problem. young. gyms retail opened, surely packing way many people. time cannot meet friends home. Make sense I‚Äôm RN cardiac ICU. much is. studies long term damage talk cardiac enzymes like troponins. enzymes elevated virtually serious illness serious illness stresses heart. doesn‚Äôt mean permanent damage.

In order know permanent damage covid, you‚Äôd need echocardiogram before, during, well diagnosis check ejection fraction.

I‚Äôm covid denier. take care people everyday. virus sensationalized. thought last night revising opinion it.... agree woman age 40-ish, year terms dating one worst side effects Covid.  Every life-stage cohort ""worst problem"" course Covid itself, crappy one.

I mostly trying let 32yo woman know still strong chance she'll meet someone baby late.  think still plenty hope. Maybe he‚Äôs one accomplished doctors researchers field. I‚Äôm sure politics bureaucracy speak served presidents parties close four decades Stop clutching pearls he's negative, indirect avoids speaking absolutes

Simpletons like uncomfortable facts people refuse boil world incredibly simple terms good vs bad. Really nothing anyone (apart improving education system), cause dealing facts, regardless popular are, scientists fundamentally do. vaccine pushed back week due winter storm supply issues. I'm nowhere near Texas. still clusterfuck storm impacts unfortunately Except die climate change that's propaganda extremists designed scare vilifying people using oil necessary survival. incorrect. *apparent* spikes following *apparent* dips equally nonexistent. holiday weekends way less reporting, less testing, etc. looks like numbers go down. catch up, looks like numbers spike upward. upward spike large downward dip. [If look hospitalization lags catch effect (look every long weekend, holiday, artifacts deaths cases hospital census), see spike following holidays.

This accurately predicted would super bowl spike. incorrectly predicted spikes Thanksgiving Christmas, data show true. simply look stuff per capita, otherwise make sense. people, die. yield resources, resources service people.

Looking per capita, America still worst 10 far deaths go, like adjusting population paints deceptively rosy picture something. happen due countries different attitudes vaccines, cold storage issue effective vaccines (moderna Pfizer), rich countries currently supply Maybe 2025 over. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è idea. might risk-pooling everyone gets better rate. Insurance would collapse people needed ones pay it. state Illinois, plan. Nope. believe me. friends allies. Brexit? Shit happens. permanent. Nothing ever same. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è fact, one could easily claim western pandemic.

To extent, still small outbreaks time time nothing compared West seen that's harsher longer lockdowns. Unfortunately, seems ""strict"" always effective. get long he's without able play (politics) game. He's career bureaucrat scientist point. whole roadmap nonsense. Events &amp; gyms opened time meeting friends house allowed. roadmap basically means ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù next 4 months, move goalpost ridiculous target cannot still get Polio vaccines dark corners World, guy think get covid vaccine there? talk Taliban Afghanistan? goes anything epidemiological. Pandemics end, regardless vaccines. Vaccines prevent massive loss lives letting pandemics run course equally massive economic consequences trying prevent them.

I warn guys, ""war covid"" may become version war terror, drugs, whatever. Driven ambition ideology science. think we're mostly agreement--just public verbalizations informed science overly cautious public health attitudes. Technically today could still say, ""if concerned spreading HIV, kiss"" wrong. need understand that's he's recommending 2 3 masks too. Read bloody story, mate. cares!? Let‚Äôs stay lockdown forever! future world doesn‚Äôt matter it? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'm curious, live started vaccinating people AstraZeneca, news stories appeared lot people get side effects (flu like symptoms like high fever) getting it. actually common AZ vaccine compared Pfizer, media sensationalist like always? #8 today, move quickly like 15 5 mean easiest straight forward solution save lives. quite clearly solution. however, remains best path toward getting point masks longer needed. don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm public speaker. need people supposed clever speak properly.

You make one entirely, like inferred.  too. I've shots already, significant hope, makes extremely unlikely get sick spread COVID, much definite information available, keep precautions, prevent catching especially spreading virus. thought returned freedom yet? Omg saw post history. Literally posts negative pieces news.

Sad sack good description UK one countries done worse US basically every way need 70 weeks get everyone one dose! 
My 65yr old Mother first dose Moderna today learning called ""Vaccination Administration Error"" vaccine squirted back syringe administered. Important note Mother *not* see much vaccine actually injected looking away process, told person injecting ""some squirted needed go talk nurse next."" 

The first dose Moderna Vaccine supposed .5mL read CDC website- leaks syringe: ""most vaccine"" administered, left is. ""most"" vaccine administered, full vaccine re-administered. 

Kinda hard discern ""most"" syringe fails. definitely hard know watching process patient. 

Not sure issue faulty syringe maybe lack training staff first week particular pop-up clinic County. (And county official website, worries illegitimate- maybe worth noting new.) 

When worker came back told Mom get answers head doctor making decisions (and quote) ""probably fine"" ""they would call days let know come back re-dose."" 

She like answer all. mother struggles mobility getting big ordeal, plus would uncertainty when, (let's real things hectic) would even hear back. Doctors decision would ultimately opinion worker admitted ""had known"" much squirted out. 

So Mom pulled seriously admirable move (I proud least) said would rather wait clinic (which parking lot) whatever safe space chose doctor could provide answer. seemed speed things up, 15 minutes later told could give another dose- time .3mL instead original .5mL Mother's request, would given head nurse. happily accepted. 

My question: point, think safe say received anywhere .3mL-.7mL first dose. see good data anywhere describing potential ramifications situation, any. would love input anyone expertise. 

She feeling great today went like many us looking forward relieving year-long anxiety. pre-existing conditions including high blood pressure weak heart rheumatic fever child, well surviving uterine cancer 3 years ago. allergic penicillin MSG. unhealthy BMI roughly 5'7 240lbs. I'm sure weight would make difference dosage(?) relevant figured could worth mentioning. 

Thanks much reading help offer!



TL;DR Moms first dose .5mL leaked syringe unknown amount injected (worker described squirting back syringe know much gone in.) Nurse decided administer .3mL more. concerned received anywhere .3-.7mL first dose side effects efficacy issues. that‚Äòs thing matters? I‚Äòm final year school Germany. gone back now, many grade wouldn‚Äòt able graduate. allow now. Hardly risk. Jesus that's leap spainish mexican german flu ect.  curious, what's SoCal people hating Newsom? I'm Cali I'd imagine liberal areas like SoCal would like him... general society shortcomings too, proper leadership, could averted many deaths.

Absolutely, almost every single country--yes, inlucing sub's beloved Australia New Zealand--has share genuine COVID deniers ""Covidiots."" know fixes people? constantly putting media spotlight, one thing, actually enforcing health measures. lot people talked Americans individualistic selfish, indivualistic thinking leads people thinking individuals unquiely responsible leaders government doing. mean, look what's going Texas right now; amount personal responsibility going fix issue Americans need understand actually demand leaders. Whats reasoning this?

No one pontificate outside pay grade. includes Fauci Navarro. CNN reliable source. It‚Äôs entertainment news, better TMZ. Life never return normal, midst power play realise pecking order could change worse. people need go fuck already.. time spotlight dwindling theyre panicking. rightfully preventable death one many. I'd say least half deaths attributed incompetence government DC way local.

We're point we're celebrating cases dropping rapidly. good news. problem like celebrating massive forest fire put entire forest burned down. Yup, really highlights strengths weaknesses. Mass producing complicated product, shipping nationwide stringent storage requirements, implementing massive rollout entire country? problem. Getting individuals modify behavior protect others? Impossible. called liar sure you‚Äôd expect dude. great day. think China welding people inside apartments?

Because hospitals full... k, well come. I'm going refrain treating stuff like certain then, think we'll wait much longer. Useless incorrect statement. restrictions didn‚Äôt exist magical force making go higher. fact Florida restrictions UK deaths would much lower. 

Restrictions work zero examples lockdowns imposed virus growing exponentially afterwards. One needs look European country clearly see time lockdown introduced see happens gets lifted early.  


Then one needs look Australian states clearly see lockdown started lockdown ended see flat line go months Uh, ‚ÄúMexican flu‚Äù? I‚Äôm sure made one entirely taking opportunity refer Mexican people among list animals, fuck talking about? need therapy education, badly. can‚Äôt defend position merits resort name calling.

My issue didn‚Äôt enough it‚Äôs guidance confusing even contradictory times. lack clarity lot measures rules major part apathy lockdown measures reached boiling points Christmas. 

I agree would criticised regardless clearer leadership needed throughout No, Navarro contradicting scientific consensus spread disease. virus tracking control. always another bird, swine, mexican flu ect going overlap keep us locked forever. ever recall regaining freedom country? Providence Therapeutics making really massive claims. even manufacturing facility setup claiming make 50 million doses Fall. lot us starting suspects them, claims large little show. 

The Novovax deal great. That's going made NRC facility we're still building. believe might get vaccines late 2021, early 2022. Canada hopefully fully vaccinated. 

The globe mail article linked backs I'm [researchers around globe develop COVID-19 vaccine record time, Canada‚Äôs greatly diminished manufacturing capacity left mercy international sources secure supplies. 

As no, vaccine production 

I never said vaccine production. said enough industry support it. 

Which outlined quote supplied. That's new 1 shot regimens coming on-line next months important. J&amp;J Novavax approved soon. Please back claims data, sources confirmable raw facts otherwise potentially adding misinformation. I'm legitimately curious see sources.  didn‚Äôt say op did. specifically said media misinformation around AZ it‚Äôs one non-profit vaccine. That‚Äôs big claim. 

And yes, media gets things wrong. I‚Äôm obviously suggesting perfect infallible. OP make specific claim media misinformation campaign purpose generating profit non-AZ companies. don‚Äôt explain also bad reporting around vaccines too. I‚Äôm thinking lot [this thread saw which, part, wonders media still claims evidence vaccines‚Äô efficacy terms stopping spread infections. 

Is shoddy reporting around Pfizer Moderna‚Äôs vaccine sloppiness shoddy reporting around AZ definitely it‚Äôs non-profit?? reporting around J&amp;J Novavax similarly described ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù despite overall good results like AZ? for-profit companies isn‚Äôt media propping like OP suggests? 

As regulators dragging feet, knows. guess good mine, I‚Äôm willing buy bad media reporting puts negative pressure regulators. ZERO EVIDENCE profit motives involved point deliberate misinformation. Suggesting otherwise plays right hands anti-vax crowd. 

I‚Äôm asking stop making claims evidence, that‚Äôs all. simple thing, guess not. Man, article reinforces every fear future dealing virus. author seems believe even vaccines, we'll dealing lockdowns foreseeable future.  That's good. Sorry ill. I'm also currently mentally ill entirely caused months living alone studio apartment. goes ways. 

Personally seems reasonable vaccinate people like never look back. seem confused. goal shutting businesses stop hospitals overrun. 

Reopening businesses mean can‚Äôt shut hospitals overrun. 

Businesses never closed stop spread covid. one told were. idea myth persists. FYI: England actually distributed Pfizer vaccines AZ. Last time checked c.60/40. AZ growing proportion however.  think Lonza produces Moderna vaccine different sites Switzerland, Belgium, Spain ... oh wow, read arguments, anyone see read see know 15 :D good thing though ? Lol. can‚Äôt open masks ? Uh, actually Canada? am, describing doesn‚Äôt remotely match reality can't speak UK (where article published). guess US mask mandates gone summer. Maybe back place temporarily cases rise fall, also see widespread pushback we're place everybody wants vaccine chance get one. issue masking stupidly contentious US people longer dying thousands, can't see much US sustaining mask mandates. Honestly guess: masks oversold. measure make public feel like something helpless. reality unless going truly lock down, much going change. Every study says masks reason decline discounting people stopped going much mandates put place. also isn‚Äôt true control population. It‚Äôs modeling best guesses.

Totally useless, no. Oversold bit, absolutely. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I‚Äôm sorry job. Millions people died didn‚Äôt sympathy that, get none return.

And you‚Äôre complaining extremely simple effective ways prevent millions deaths? crybaby. evidences AZ favoured UK EU?

AZ deliveries UK massively behind schedule despite factory upgrade investments starting last May UK. good Social distancing lift fully 21st June, quite 18 months pretty close point though? compare UK lockdown better picture, It‚Äôs binary. US UK jump start nations, middle income lower income nations receiving vaccine deliveries. It‚Äôs nothing approach. ‚ÄúWhile prospect 90,000 capacity crowd inside Wembley Euro 2020 final 12 July remains unlikely‚Äù - didn‚Äôt even read article initially it‚Äôs saying They're gonna look like right tits UK fully vaccinated lockdown ended way EUs. Sounds like everything going open June 21st UK, going happen EU then. 15-20 degrees average CA! rainy highs 50s 70s sun. Feels like mid/late April already. There's difference current chance infection wishful thinking. Sorry illness, actually got choice I'm enjoying lockdown. edit - June much, open? Presuming super variants, think see one significant uptick cases late March early May people go outside false sense security. think past seeing another significant uptick deaths though risk vaccinated then. forget war cancer. lifetime least declare war something lose.  Also nothing rude comment. expect better. (or worse?)

Give good insult involve geese. big-brain, geek funny right here! Love it. Depends live. us states already removed masks mandates. 1. cost vaccines aren‚Äôt anywhere near $10,000. topping around $40-60 per dose. make hypothetical using number large changes decision points, also makes less relevant discussion hand.

2. US government much stronger obligation duty care citizens residents, people nations. would entirely appropriate government allow rich citizens within country monopolize vaccines (to ensure fairness optimize health outcomes), time ensuring it‚Äôs front queue nations trying secure vaccines. fairness, alot production facilities location, fact fucked hard everything else need vaccinate much can. masks, social distancing, vaccine proof required nice normal fun time out. Marijuana reform positive, likely legalized make tax money humane reasons. world around ever gotten worse. Everything always cost wages barely move. year job, social life, reasons living taken away, basically house arrest year done number millions people. seems silly think anything ever get better again. wonder factors J&amp;J Pfizer/Moderna ramp up? Still dates bad means seniors option vaccinated 3/1 really remaining vulnerable people March. regained sense smell. grandma didn‚Äôt. Great news! Especially certain safe. might crazy head even covid gave cancer, would rather isolated life got covid December mild me. symptoms went away 2 days. sucks people lingering symptoms sure hope there's going treatments that. data effective vaccines preventing transmission virus? Thanks Germany dealing vaccine rollout well don‚Äôt really need another vaccine feel like long ago 250,000. Amazing numbers increased. Wooooo!

Fewer new cases people currently hospitalized. difference declining spiking. article specifically us lol. maybe confusion lies. Yeah I'm camp we're trending right direction able ""normal-ish"" things minimal risk summer/fall still caution exercised. I'm expecting wear mask crowded places (the subway, large public venues) while. feel like article trying communicate things look positive risks unknowns.

I commenting people think anything short masks, distancing, thought towards virus summer terrible news. presume must breaking rules act like dick presume misplaced belief superior others .

 simply stated lockdown going far long time June much. get right again. 

It boring listening people like nose ass deal lockdown forever. Well done, mental health others toilet. lockdown needs end. Idk. know someone 20s mild case near beginning pandemic day still vertigo, markedly decreased endurance, infrequent episodes palpitations.

Just look NBA players who've caught it. Westbrook clearly player since caught it. Jimmy Butler lost like 20 pounds. fittest humans Earth prime lives still experiencing ongoing effects disease. seems random effects people. ER Nurse could never see clear distinct pattern besides age. Pfizer Moderna gave clear reasons delays happened (to increase production capacity) still target deliver doses set respective contracts Q1.

AZ cut deliveries 60% Q1 one week approval still clear delivery schedule March Q2. No. work researchers. opinion we've (in US) followed worst possible course keeping restrictions high enough make everyone miserable strong enough completely control virus. think we'd better going much stricter initial lockdowns, easing letting people get back normal, reintroducing short, strict lockdowns necessary. might ended one month two months lockdowns year, would far better year continuously partially locked down. also timing restrictions. tends simple difference countries badly restrictions well; ones badly almost always put restrictions virus already control, people wonder numbers going months. point already late; country already badly numbers come yet. UK behind restrictions waves, surprise ended bad numbers.

And yeah thing California restrictions actually severe standards US, probably actually reduce community traffic meaningful enough way make impact. still go shopping malls, hair salons, lot things absolutely open countries went ""lockdown"". go, Girl :-) talk brainwashed literally post safe space conspiracy theories regarding COVID-19 try spread here. hate boner Fauci bearing fact. 'Normal' means something different article. desperately wanted create headline, they?

They're basically referring kind barrier inconvenience restriction. 

A bit hyperbolic, would similar publishing article saying 9/11 never truly ended TSA still enhanced screenings US.

Inconvenience free international travel take lot longer happen local, regional, national ""normalcy."" unless places keep ironclad border controls place long term, going able go almost wherever want almost whatever want within 8 months. Much less 2 years. probably wearing masks huh? Honest question ? think worst case realistic scenario small bump March/April due variants.

I think realistic scenario last true wave, least seasonality effect takes hold fall/winter (you probably see small ‚Äúwaves‚Äù like every fall/winter COVID becomes endemic, like flu). How?
All restrictions lifted end June mid tournament. really brainwashed clearly think everything Fauci sunshine rainbows. He‚Äôs hack. Uh, read road map top epidemiologists would make similar recommendations

They're operating job-preserving mentality though, they?

By token politicians enact measures (of kind). elect politicians sit office nothing. yet many cases problems (not covid) restraint action best response. started working researcher 1968. loved spotlight would become head NIH rather decline stay focused infectious disease NIAD. doesn‚Äôt put foot mouth either. J&amp;J recommendation FDA Friday, no? TIL learned bunch fuckwits jetting Mallorca lockdown. fact countries shitshow. Wrong.

Canada track defeat virus April/May. dont even need fully vaccinated September beat it.

Think war. U.S. forced fight enemy (covid) country. Canada kicked ass early late war low enough numbers easily surrounded vaccinated people. Creating vaccine siege around virus. know hotspots are. know virus is. We're tracking movement trajectories. half Canadas population vaccinated April/May Canada race! Emergency use approval, based completed phase 3 clinical trials, requires trials continue. Ironically, Denver even talking West Virginia, *Western* Virginia talking city only?

The rest state indoor dinging since late May/early June. sorry hear that. still get bad inflammation fatigue. march, sick hell 2.5 months False equivalence.

There's big difference country excess deaths 20% higher official covid deaths country excess deaths 200% higher. true. old people poor neighborhoods get vaccines. Every single vaccine producer underdelivered though. focusing ones that‚Äôs produced cost? Thank you, good see! need differentiate actual approval EUA. vaccines **not** approved yet. think still Stage 3 clinical trials. CT outlined ages gonna able receive vaccine

3/1 - ages 55-64
3/22 - ages 45-54
4/12 - ages 35 - 44
5/3 - ages 16 - 34 Look way. get FBI director world's greatest field agent. get CEO hospital network accomplished heart surgeon. get commissioner NFL wizard Xs Os flex defense. chiefs staff military necessarily nation's best field tacticians.

At certain level bureaucrat administrator ""scientist"" anymore. estimation particular bureaucrat good messaging public relations. puts foot mouth regularly seems LOVE spotlight. 2020 best year dude's life. doubt wants let go. declines started blast super cold weather ice snow. Every state declining mid January, several states already declining November December. Basically, states started fall wave earliest started falling earliest states started fall wave latest falling latest. States upper midwest pretty much back fall wave. countries administered single vaccine.

Most countries tested populations level even close US. pretty obvious. large venues go holiday travel over. would likely fall 30% Even doubling ever 2 weeks, would still take 2 half months catch vaccinations, point majority country vaccinated. infection rate never high immunity now.  Thanks data. 2:1 ratio give lowest credible interval, sadly make take ~50% longer reach 72 144 cases. [And US anywhere 60,000 150,000 excess deaths associated *Everyone* inaccurate numbers country immune corruption. Good news. Let's see get 1M week soon keep climbing. No. It‚Äôs largest donor. Yes. might even idea. see people treating Fauci messiah found post Making flu vaccine relatively trivial, tbh. national stockpile H5N1 vaccine (which shown extraordinarily deadly humans). say, least would months ahead COVID breaks out. arriving tomorrow, we'll see goes. problem causing overwhelmed hospitals deaths? sure sarcastic one eminent researchers infectious disease Considering uptake, whatever people saying taking AZ Pfizer seem materialising though, unlike actual news reports significant amounts rejections AZ Germany  guess what? likely survive Covid since fully vaccinsted. coronavirus infectious, put measuring stick far nose üëÉüêΩ ?

Genuinely curious often think everyone germaphobic am, pandemic would significantly less severe it‚Äôs actually everyone taking masking/exposure/ventilation/etc. seriously. Oh well. No, EU insists antagonising UK left.

From shorter distance UK end country. could friends... :( possible people infected SARS back 2003 least little bit immunity COVID-19? don‚Äôt think really matters, amount people SARS low. it‚Äôs interesting thought. 10% efficacy. means **the world need AZ**.

No. Every company uses criteria. BioNTech among strict. Moderna requires TWO MILD + PCT test confirm covid case. AZ. 

Likely. likely. cares J&amp;J AZ? BioNTech Moderna. Second front - NovaVax CureVac. 

*Modified variant trialed* *modified variant available* = big difference.

BioNTech, example, need second variant. First excellent wonderful

What people already vaccinated AZ? immunity vector? Yes! Buy BioNTech!

""*In UK two nurses went anaphylactic shock*"" inevitable, eat Daily Mail bullshit breakfast. surprising. Parents make sure kids safe following protocols. Can't Mr. Smith wants go ""Margarita Monday"" teachers. US:

\- producing vaccines

\- Funded R&amp;D vaccines

\- Rejoined throwing money countries get vaccines cheaper.

\- MANUFACTURING VACCINES. people stubborn can‚Äôt saved, even evidence coming UK 3-4 weeks, think enough change many minds. people see eyes AZ death machine, actually highly effective vaccine, people want arms. It‚Äôs objectionable use guise privacy push COVID denial simultaneously ignoring many ways government done Well I'd say find answer asking one stay limelight saying say. Also like Peter Tosh (I think??) version west Jamaica subbed in. Queue UK shut rest developed world woods there‚Äôs gaping hole vaccine. Aside consistent ramping vaccine production distribution (which could happened 2nd Trump admin, don‚Äôt get know) willingness spend big relief bills, actual federal covid policy hasn‚Äôt changed much, correct. International travel still fine etc. far messaging difference night day, translated much actual policy action? really unfortunately well climate change shows US control anything take care issues. Others going lead US deals end stage capitalism. hate everyone offered vaccine too. What's even point requiring stage? dangerous flu point. irrational anger filled idiot comes surface... Took gamble booked trip Hawaii August. Here's hoping things mostly normal then! important note way AZ distributed, ""family doctors"" GPs. volunteer health agency gve vaccien patients, call patients target population (50-65 yo commorbidities) make lists 10 people per bottle vaccine plan shots day. order bottle pharmacy, go get it, go back practice inject patients, addition usual workload.

The french government expected 70 000 volunteer doctors least, they've got 30 000 far.

So, target population, still need doctor willing follow process. 

This effect means many patients held hostage doctors.

I'm lucky, doctor volunteered, I'll amongst 10 first patients gives shot to. Belgium #1. Definitely poor country.  Well there‚Äôs Vietnam then.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* He's said measures need stay place we've achieved herd immunity. based science. Short approach like risk losing progress made since vaccines first rolled out.

Good know science common sense apply family. know, know happened Fauci fibbed. he's admitted regard herd immunity threshold try influence vaccine uptake rates. Yep lot correlation causation going around. US really bad compare countries like South Korea Vietnam. Obama left Trump pandemic playbook response team. Trump ignored first, fired second made wearing masks political. left 500,000 deaths, country like Vietnam (with population 100 million) 35 deaths. failure epic proportions. still cases shot - shot reduce likelihood case passing on.

From tell, chances severe Covid reduce liquid state, I‚Äôd say is. water molecule weakly bonded water molecules, hence it‚Äôs wet. lesson expect GOP successfully handle pandemic, quickly people forgotten Reagan handled AIDS pandemic deplorable. Also 2nd largest state country experiencing ongoing blackout.   Yup fine people care get long get vaccine. hear things happening EU take vaccine incredible here. Saying improve one thing. Saying worst quite another. good news. thought might be. bc they‚Äôre islands. they‚Äôre sparsely populated remote islands that‚Äôs much less integrated nearby countries, relatively. Also main strain original Chinese strain less contagious first European/Italian strain came US UK well. UK 2 hour car ride France, it‚Äôs silly compare them. Correction: Florida, California, Texas, rojo states done worse country agree it. 

The suspicion we're parsing words we're saying ""all Americans"" offered vaccine ""70% population vaccinated"" include kids 16? does, could mean talk bullshit we're headed bait switch later on. can't get rid masks ""everyone"" offered vaccine that's June next year probably. 

They need start clearing expectations. Maybe that's coming vaccine supply higher demand, happen. Otherwise may able go baseball game people going largely want. worry it. first read title thought vaccine caused total hospitalization rate Scotland go 94%, vaccines already caused amazing herd immunity effects. Sometimes read something twice get full picture cannot believe number healthy, level headed people I've talked like, ""::shrug::, get it, get it"". read potential long term impacts all?

I have...but hell worrying going help? wear mask, social distance, wash hands, avoid gatherings. Anything else control. Every single expert field expected this, first actual empirical evidence, vaccines reduce symptomatic dissease, also spread actual virus. saying weeks. Meanwhile Scott Gottlieb Face Nation talking everything's going normal next two three months. 

Can somebody explain two seemingly smart men reaching completely divergent conclusions regarding short-term trajectory pandemic a) old news

b) delay temporary

c) production increased

AZ flying shelf NOW. help snowing parts Northeast. board certified doctors journalists put jail? names, certifications jail sentences please? would probably say mixing vaccine would probably better training body two slightly different strain. research needed, heard old studies (not covid vaccine) increase immunity response long run better cell response crucial. things back normal fall I‚Äôm definitely going back states watching football game. That‚Äôs one thing can‚Äôt get living Asia. adjuvant makes probable good antigen response could eliminate need second dose extend functional immune response vaccine. would game changer. We‚Äôre pretty great vaccinations. true, infact, opposite true spreading misinformation. vaccines save lives. like supporting sports team blindly make anything justify team best. must‚Äôve understood title wrong. thought would cut corners bit Yeah two people know passed 70s serious health problems (I‚Äôm talking hypertension...cancer one uncontrolled diabetes point blindness other) answer could yes depending Florida... understand rationale posting OP comment.

Did think ""reddit hates banks, therefore must disagree banker""? ""we might be"" ""it quite conceivable"" ""still degree"" ""we certainly likely, likely"" ""it conceivable"" ""we may to"" ""under certain circumstances""

I get know sure careful, talks like this, feel like idea hell he's talking about.  Yeah areas England also started 16-65 underlying conditions group well. Really excellent progress. Paywall article, anybody mind posting full text? Yes, we're excited here. /s

Y'all want spare us? way would virus outpace vaccinations. We're vaccinating hundreds thousands every day, peak cases 60k depth winter. significant, it‚Äôs surprising all. duration disease shortened symptoms lessened inevitably decreases spread. stories favorite. Every single person changes mind vaccine hesitancy makes % people refuse get vaccine little smaller, gets us tiny bit closer protecting people medically fragile able recieve vaccine. hopefully people models help social circles get closer accepting vaccine.  Illinois reasonable restrictions too. Definitely severe blue states, Chicago sub vehemently pro-lockdown either. Pritzker somehow found nice middle-ground.  Yes, EU makes enemies exporting vaccines UK, Israel, Canada, China, Japan, totally 30+ countries.

UK something different, makes enemy, bans vaccine export. Even Canada. cosplay friends told Florida currently packed conventions, unbelievable me. friend who's visiting mother week, told specifically text compare Massachusetts. I've heard, quarter people restaurants wearing masks, bars malls totally open, really know there's pandemic going watch news. except medical studies.

It seems like Canada much Europe stuck harsh lockdowns focus fighting virus matter cost people's wellbeing mental health. Many restrictions little base science- example limits outdoor socialization. kept sane going walks friend group, eating patio restaurants, occasionaly get together everyone tests quarantines first... much world that's illegal. hard enough is, can't imagine badly would fallen apart live one endless lockdown countries.

Yes, we've relatively high number deaths per 100k people, still lower countries UK Italy. suspect given obesity rate country, destined harder time anyway.

It seems like US rare country acknowledge lockdowns severe costs, higher rates depression substance abuse, need weighed whatever marginal lower caseload achieve.

Canada Europe keep lockdowns values push put safety else, one really glad living United States this. It‚Äôs not. We‚Äôve proven base safe effective. Making adjustment isn‚Äôt whole new vaccine. Flu shots adjusted every year. don‚Äôt run full trials (or any??) year. think US going surplus vaccines relatively short time, like month two. hopeful charge happily share border friends north :). He's got wrong many times even funny. AZ vaccine infact disproportionately used oldest vulnerable. Opposite said. 6 months late! It‚Äôs bs.

We fully sacrificed last vestiges economy. locked people beach completely banned alcohol. Destroying restaurants, craft bear wine industries. really hard. thought wore felt sick something, time like this. That's seemed see photos Japan's streets prior pandemic New Zealand isn‚Äôt example. Take look damn near East Asia. I‚Äôm Germany I‚Äòd take it. Pfizer, AZ, Sinovac, couldn‚Äòt give shit. get COVID live, give dosis. cements point! went Florida January.

Nobody become friends hesitant hang fear catching virus? 

Someone Florida please respond answers questions. Reddit says guys completely normal true would love move there.  new facility Montreal completed may pump AstraZeneca. 


So no, vaccine production. even time over. ability make millions vaccines Canadas. population we'll one fastest vaccinated countries world. Funnily enough, looks like UK going come much sooner expected, long keep tight lid possible routes entry new strains.

Our government plenty fuck ups vaccination program definitely among them. genome sequencing ability find new strains also second none. That‚Äôs point. compare country don‚Äôt want ‚Äúthey‚Äôre islands‚Äù... remember UK also island. complete nonsense. Trump disagreed numerous times said much publicly. like use analogy kid arguing parents use kind arguments regards say cleaning room aka telling half truths technically lies really actual truth parents would tell stop lying start cleaning room I‚Äôm American I‚Äôm much looking forward graduating shit job economy risking losing health insurance turn 26.

I also don‚Äôt want children due possibly inheritable health problems aspect life doesn‚Äôt much bearing me. 

I wish way socialize college friends.  dream Lol made germany even funded Money somehow america gets quick call? mean, link info? can‚Äôt figure whats going can‚Äôt find articles apart idea floated loads, EU Ireland basically saying UK donating poorer countries fair, US much larger population What‚Äôs ‚Äúgoal percentage‚Äù take kids equation? 100% eligible population? also much likely find non-glasses wearers. country prioritize people? American company, aiming get Americans back work society. realize sucks Canada production own, lets jump Pfizer USA's throat every country does: self-preservation. 

It's though they're taking literally every dose Americans either. refuse vaccinate countries comes control. emotional reaction easier follow research people. I'm never surprised see comments like thought put pressing ""Post"". Yes! finally winning category uplifting! Canadian vaccination campaign sucks, much government it. Canadian federal government purchased vaccination dosages per capita country world. 

The sticky detail foriegn companies lower Canada's status list priorities much do. like Trudeau pull gun heads. 

It's frustrating seeing government say ""everyone vaccinated September"" we've moving speed grass growing. Like yeah right we'll then. I'm expecting mine late 2021 earliest--probably early 2022 realistic. imagine country funded developed barely sees it. Went usa Israel. world live in.. still wear mask break rooms


I‚Äôm concerned passing parents still even I‚Äôm safe severe symptoms myself


I don‚Äôt know overly cautious worked hard community college three years end transferring dream school Fall, 2019. I'm graduating Spring. Almost every single upper division class I've taken major zoom I've learned absolutely nothing. I'm really heartbroken S√≥ queria uma agulha bra√ßo :( Source? variants display mutations known aid transmission. 
You think don‚Äôt?
And nothing ever proven science. never use term. asked would take comfortable ""normal""?

I understand waiting 2 weeks past last shot, even understand bit hesitant *now* since there's still decent amount spread vaccinations made masses yet. I'm talking people may get vaccinated June, adults want (hopefully) able get it. friends vaccinated. parents already vaccinated **now**. still comfortable outdoor bar? getting plane? waiting exactly??

I want help, maybe there's nothing do. miss friends :( You‚Äôre forgetting deaths go linearly though. Without restrictions, hospitals would‚Äôve overrun fairly quickly. overrun hospitals leads many deaths covid things. 

What would alternative? let people die? easy choice make. restrictions something, math acts like nothing. fair say (hopefully) worst Right it‚Äôs conclusively proven transmissible. It‚Äôs rough estimates data panning out. sure, rubbing eyes big. I'd say glasses wearers also tend really make sure masks right.

If mask perfect, glasses fog something fierce. remove glasses, find I'm basically blowing directly eyes. quite,

during Trump's last month presidency, new vaccinations ranged 100k-1 million (Dec 20- Jan 20) **one** day (Jan 14) surpassing 1 million new vaccinations 1.1 million.

Regardless, super picky anyway.

(My source guys wondering:  USA NUMBA WAN! What? numbers cases variant growing happens 50/50 new/old variants? 
Growth rate = x + 
X shrinking faster growing.
Growth rate negative. 
X reaches zero. 
What growth rate? love subreddit hate subreddit. I'm saying, everyone actually isolate two weeks pandemic would stop. one asked long would need isolate everyone end pandemic. I'm advocating global lockdown, answering question. glad live right now. It‚Äôs waiting game, buddy still can‚Äôt taste he‚Äôs COVID-free month Since also learning this...does work steamed glasses like shower? tired using shampoo body wash. Cry College fun understand frustration. saying post college years maybe fun dont worry much. Im speaking hindsight dumb naive college best years adult life still ahead.

I would say college consumed alcohol partied hardest post college friends hometown, friends college, friends work friends town worked in. probably socially fulfilling time life.

Also cost living increased much working much money college (university free come could factor) post college years, ie early twenties early thirties travelled coolest holidays.

I would say thirties probably best years life. newly married, stable job young kids. Im forties still happy. kids getting older things fun us first time.

Getting older sucks ignoring distance death would rank decades (actually put groups 9 able separate school college) follows: 

1) 0-9 : fucking awesome, kid amazing. 10/10 would recommend.

2) 28 - 36 : actual best years mans life.

3) 19 - 27 : time partied also time socially immature.

4) 37 - 45 : dad many ways better drinking till puke shoes hoped would one night stand hand came lower back pain.

5) 10 - 18 : school sucks, one teachers sucked (RIP, Tee-Aitch) exam stress cherry cake. acne. Fuck acne. think need agree everyone twenties gets obligatory extra year twenties due quarantine. ‚ÄúHello, yes I‚Äôve turned 29.1‚Äù see comments like look else user comments. It‚Äôs eye opening. count ~50th place vaccine rate working sure working! recommend confirmed immunity SARS Cov 2, anywhere 10% 20% seem prone reinfection 3 months based numbers seen, especially new variants making hard naturally acquired antibodies detect virus. plasma treatments effective South African strain. declare covid ""public health emergency international concern"" late january? count advice?

Obviously that's 1 month first reported people argue want whether that's fast slow, seems like like countries really anything well could have. sound nice guess fat, uneducated criminal procured vaccines better Canada's responsible leader think vaccine works substantially better difference lot vaccine uptake. difficult compare well immunity long run comparing two viruses. One issue specific influenza memory B cells really prevent transmission... Although probably reduce severity quite bit. let's say get severe influenza case relatively young person probably going pretty good protection least, likely rest life. still able transmit others Herd immunity impossible vaccine prevent transmission different, require vaccines restaurants shops, they? they've tested years. makes think entitled interfere someone else's personal health decision based something *you're even risk vaccinated*? okay you? really nice watch someone different view suffer? Hahahah thread amazing. critical America Trudeau literally go knees beg biden vaccines. Covid tests false positive rate far 1%... got vaccinated last week asked ID verify appointment didn‚Äôt ask proof qualification. Doesn‚Äôt seem strict all. I‚Äôve dozens friends get vaccine single one provide proof. book appointment online. poster posed question masks would remain mandatory herd immunity reached cited seasonal surges, like flu. Implying Covid-19, aggressively vaccinated against, probably dooming eradication gradually diluting strength seasonal cold virus, big enough deal locking every winter virus killing anyone, obviously make sense. Oh, governments countries could set aside differences work together achieve common goal. bad probably never happen. said, region polarized, people. I'm little late respond muscular pain fatigue first dose. Second dose within 4 hours got chills 101F fever. terrible muscular pain move legs ear ached like other. sleep throughout night morning 104F continuing chills muscle pain. kept jumping 104 101F two days received vaccine.

I received Moderna I'm 27F. Literally thread replying someone said ‚Äúmasks new norm‚Äù Life really going hard you. so? flu still thing covid contagious period. countries stricter mandates eliminated flu, yes, likely come back masks thing past borders open up. Covid around without masks pure reliance vaccines. I've got friend like that... he's pathologically worried ""long haul"" COVID vaccinated people still spread virus (and possible get infected even vaccinated)

I'll thing hanging friends want to. I'm going push antagonistic, assume eventually FOMO drive bunker seeing pictures people fun getting sick. Doesn‚Äôt seem happening based numbers Yea. Congress probably restrict pharma patents happens. better change opinion stick immutable view. Antimaskers summer zero covid equally intransigent. What‚Äôs 2nd country? UK israel? I'm 25 year old fully vaccinated individual little hard just, flip light switch start social again. much much less fear, amazing i'm grateful, there's lot last year need slowly ""unlearn"" ""relearn"" things again. I'm getting there, i've done last week i've done last year felt awesome. seriously asking hep, think suggesting low risk things, even though they're vaccinated, might help slowly transition reality again. Usually, i'm ""throw pool let learn swim"" person this, easy. Maybe eating outdoors, maybe going walk going outdoor shopping plaza etc. That's started really helped feel comfortable covid, functionally killed friendships reason die.

From perspective risk person, lives risk person, lost many people understanding concerns. would hung absolutely anybody stipulation remain outside. fucking pool early pandemic tried invite people pool day chill, again, going indoors, acted asking wear hazmat suit keep 100 foot distance see me. offered even bring TV outside watch movie night something, takers. offered come house hang driveway catch up.

[The CDC reports 1 4.6 infections thought 30% population infected end saying seems include vaccinations. 29 million cases 9% population suggests 3-4x.

I read maybe half dozen analyses vary 1-3x 4-6x 20x higher. think guesswork think makes lot sense infections many times cases. We're endgame now.  hot hell fucky ass hot ass room I'm That‚Äôs true. Liechtenstein, Belgium, Spain moving worse better US general category. they‚Äôre rich.  found reason: governor Gavin Newsom. Unless mean 2022, maybe right we'll indoor dining then. Ma'am know export ban private enterprises got confused China state owned enterprises control. That's Astrazaneca intelectual property it, right? state owned xD

Yeah need keep eating sweet propaganda effectiveness crap, good diet rot brain xD

26% export ban vaccines, impressive. EU start accelerate sooner later, exporting globally. Easy.

France free market country, ban exports vaccines controls private companies. free business ever want, China xD leadership part failure, Doc. Same, knock-on effects _just great_, procrastinate avoid anything requires hand washing since hands bad shape. 10% always 10%. means useless sh4t covid-19 pandemic.

BioNTech efficient conditions. Confirmed everywhere.

86% what? **For BioNTech 95% means free even ONE MILD symptom negative PCR test**. 

For AZ? Poor Oxford clue. stupid idea double-vacinate vector? Even Russians understood problem vaccine two different vectors. Even J&amp;J understood, enough one jab... Oxford guessing happens hate AZ.

Oxford moment nothing. re-vaccinate adenovirus wait one year. may two. know. immunity vector. 

And vector self dangerous. Read FAQ. Pfizer vaccine first available UK given oldest vulnerable generally weaker immune response, could help explain discrepancy much dangerous process? COVID general vaccines  Haha meanwhile Tampa super bowl 25,000 plus festivities, bars, restaurants, schools open cases continue crater! follow science data right... Jokes aside, good news people support bubbles performing essential jobs people recovered COVID. self hating Americans special breed, spouting nonsense like supposed surprised? said case 6 months ago. another roaring 20s, another post-9/11 world?

Damn, one sentence destroyed much optimism. Carte blanche lay pipe. Beautiful. Deaths causes small that's going big factor. compare covid death excess death, excess death still greater. large part, safe assume factors would increase decrease certain causes faced covid crisis. amount covid deaths still went beyond average expected deaths. expected, weekends always slow particularly issues still many parts country. 

I would expect Thursday Friday numbers track. people read statement take ‚ÄúEven country vaccinated, widespread restrictions still necessary everyone everywhere is‚Äù We've got good chance passing majority American adults initiating vaccination April. CDC estimates 100,000,000 Americans already infected, gives similar immunity vaccines. Cases plummeting. Hospitalizations plummeting. Deaths plummeting.

The pandemic ending. state governments feel like ending ""Pandemic life,"" summer 2020 riots going look like rowdy block party comparison. cannot tell people need sacrifice years years lives disease that's virtually eradicated across country, that's discussion public health measures within months. state governments burning credibility left right now, know think road leads I'm concerned plan finding out. chance post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Another factor could Pfizer vaccine body takes longer produce full immune response Among rich countries? No, several rich countries more. crazy regardless talking COVID publicly exposes it.  2pm east coast 11am west. Well else would end pandemic? Prayer? Essential oils?

Not sure statement controversial. seem upset lmao. I‚Äôm pointing many American hockey teams victories comes ability hire Canadians pay money Canadian teams were. isn‚Äôt all-American triumph Canada, teams immensely benefiting Canadian hockey culture youth development. could done better many areas failed.

Parroting random bullshit hear people say pretty shitty, actively hampers effective public discourse. ""the vaccine"" talking about? different types vaccines different levels effectiveness different strains. even come close sure effectiveness different vaccines different variants, dummy. feel confident saying vaccines effective UK variant; that's true. know variants sufficiently tested yet, right? E484K mutation, found B.1.351 (South Africa), P.1 (Manaus), lineages currently low prevalence worry vaccines.  [recent wave deaths strongly implies severely decreased efficacy natural infection preventing infection it, though expect good vaccines blog gives good overview extra links. Absolutely, entire northeast done Europe did, instead went full-throttle virtue-signaling nose self-amputation. least Cuomo signaling things start reopen soon, zero information government things reopen. Literally zero. Canadian, also am, aware distorted situation globalized supplier/government simply supplying evenly across world correct? 

Not every country world capabilities case raising awareness leader free world (USA) sharing freely. CONTROL COMPANIES CANADIAN FEDS.

If Canadians capability would share. one would encourage proudly. Okay? And? They‚Äôre mourning loss something important wanted experience. don‚Äôt stop condescending attitude let people mourn. something personally defining me. understand OP feeling void. thing said comment you‚Äôre lame. wildly concerned somehow mass restrictions going continue far longer they're needed United States. government get rocks destroying taxable activity.

This sums general thoughts pretty well. Capitalism may ugly monster also virtually unstoppable. think US open soon safely possible, maybe even earlier that. title misleading? Canada's population 30 - 35 million. US really vaccinating 30 million people one day? 

At rate, vaccinate entire US 10 days, give take day!  You‚Äôre addressing something totally different. kids go school wear masks. support it. now. They‚Äôre fine wearing them. Probably am. job. Thanks advice though need say 1st grader preschooler.  

the context happens September adult situation likely different kids already 18 months. Reviving second year whole different discussion. you‚Äôre parent you‚Äôre worried think it‚Äôs easy street sling line patronizingly suggested September nothing you. 

And yes, serious. I‚Äôm sure decided it‚Äôs okay people (adults kids alike) bit sad may need send 1st graders school masks basically bear brunt social distancing adults able get hammered bar. Again, that‚Äôs potentially we‚Äôre headed towards September. dismissive obviously works though. world different place now. Companies left Manhattan coming back. People hesitant start public facing business place shown shut indefinitely warning. weird Canadian see America handling covid past year thinking 'wow, least we're them!' get sense government well take care citizens. 


I've yet hear anything vaccinations, know anybody gotten one offered I‚Äôm referencing traditional college experience, 18 year old living campus (which unilaterally defined ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù) OP referencing. understand everyone luxury I‚Äôm referencing experience OP meant. sure downvoted. really OK people ask perspective outside lower level provided nationally. thought interesting US citizen read least two different local views. Good lord, I'm almost positive Covid restrictions pretty much end year, live Chicago, fairly stringent date. objective statement. get hate it? Dry Ice (frozen CO2) needs -72 C (-109 F) stay frozen, significantly lower waters freezing point. Mercury‚Äôs freezing point -39 C (-38 F).

Finally starting see downside social medicine country. receive worse quality care compared countries profit incentivized. Yes, accident illegal alien badly injured car totaled.. can't blame actions few. Shit happens. adult know that. always affected people color severely even though damaging itself.

Okay and? 

How suffering poor white-kid inner city different anyone else? They're still dealt shitty hand life stuck place high crime rates, incompetent/corrupt governance, poor school systems. 

In midwest/rust belt many factories closed down, people who've working jobs decade work. Many people become victims growing opioid crisis sweeps communities. children born communities stuck broken homes without real means escape. 

Much like kids inner cities, real way education. poverty, education becomes expensive, less accessible. mean, parents relatively older (50 57), they‚Äôve vaccinated still iffy even going store

They say can‚Äôt go get vaccine, may another year. I‚Äôm trying get clinical trial, god‚Äôs sake sister even worse am.

They‚Äôre bad parents anything long shot, holy crap... That's us Americans idiots. medical professionals flat refusing take clue we're lined around city blocks get it. Ok sounds like TED talk, it‚Äôs meant sound profound deep actually bunch nonsense. 

Other affluent countries heart disease. didn‚Äôt get rid massive national weight loss campaigns. used drugs too. 

Pollution led ton regulations 70s. Carbon capture even viable now. problem addressed policy changes.

There's lot missing data. mention lot state level.  sense rushing it, came far fuck variant causes new outbreak.


This honestly time double down. Unless we've learned nothing half assed lockdowns. almost Fauci want end. easy may think, want around people away people long weary people cause could get sick takes deprogram People moving city quickly rents dropped nearly 2018 levels! 2018! property values remained flat!

So surmise either NYC defies laws supply demand, one hell exaggeration.  anybody wants start process getting mind used normal things, watch highlights Australian Open final.

No, eyes deceiving nothing bad probably going happen full stadium.

Do that, ready see Wimbledon US Open well. molecules different freezing points water 0C. mRNA unstable normal temperatures. 

It known science mRNA stable -80C. confirming vaccine works known conditions, tested normal freezer temperatures result (this thread) vaccine still works.

mRNA macromolecule hundreds weak atomic bonds degrade vaccine work genetic code breaks down. RNA much less stable DNA general double stranded DNA allows surviving harsher conditions. asking earnest:

Get grip. people also realize quickly nailed vaccine.

all delays literally human testing / qualifications part. doin math phizers doubling production announcement hit 2.2 million that. Pfizer moderna (so far) variant proof.

That's straight false. know put minor disclaimer it, spreading misinformation. know impaired measurably B.1.351 P.1 strains.  amount probably similar Novavax vaccine, dropped 96% efficacy COVID classic 50-60% B.1.351. father-in-law former teacher, big ‚Äúthe kids fine‚Äù person. live Minnesota, social pressure ‚Äúfine‚Äù really high, young people he‚Äôs talked neighbor‚Äôs teenager nieces nephews zoom holidays.

I‚Äôm sorry mom invalidating. You‚Äôve sacrificed much virus posed small threat you. hope start engaging things make life meaningful soon. Every country capitalist don‚Äôt see point is. young, healthy person, odds avoiding severe disease hospitalization already pretty good. major value vaccine avoid getting infected providing confidence relax precautions I've living year.

If vaccine I'll keep living I'm unvaccinated taking pushes date get effective vaccine, makes sense wait keep I've doing. yeah that's definitely whats happening lmaooooo No.  Yet almost flu deaths? Keep believing numbers. Lol I‚Äôm moron? Nice man. Nice. People want reasons angry. here? part NYC turned 'scary dump'?

What tax hikes referring to? property taxes went less 2%, line increase appraisal was. 

Where violent homeless people wandering streets? went exponential increase significant decline cases January 12, corresponding least 20% decrease reproductive rate essentially overnight happened right around New Years. could due vaccination natural immunity, cause gradual changes. lot people actually changed behavior (though perhaps small amount).

What's happened since even better, hard see coming even though knew going administration change: 13% level vaccination pushed reproductive rates 10% lower still, rate vaccination rising rapidly.

As today, reproductive rates US seem still falling. Yeah, current ‚Äúhealthcare‚Äù system USA working great us...

This vaccine push due socialized healthcare. I'm 30 offered employer started weeks ago problem they're flawed arguments.

Without knowing exact medical conditions COVID victims, blanket statement many years life left average cannot made either way. Yep, Pfizer-Biontech vaccine made inmigrant scientist Germany.

The article clearly states research people wear glasses rub eyes less.

Which makes sense. takes huge leap supporting data says means lower risk om contractimg COVID19. Purely based eyes potential way catch it.

It even attempt bad science dumb. Source? Banned? rip peoples faces throw away stamp fine them? one ban mask? city state's job distribute vaccine? Perhaps good job research flattened hill. that? participation registered voters ?  Az developed educational institution sold cost, literally zero incentive lie.

Its proven giving first dose large number population far effective. Living single homes cuts massive amount cases. Basically Vietnam bringing people designated hotels quarantine, except people homes.

If Sweden whole herd immunity strategy, could level Taiwan, Vietnam response pandemic. well shit, thats vaccine fuckign worry, weary warrior, persevere able tell grandchildren fought valiantly roving gangs Battle Vernon Boulevard.

At point time, essential stop worst gangs heading bridge Roosevelt Island. Sure, all, correct? That‚Äôs dumb honestly. think adjusting demographics fairly simple do, really support idea nordic countries vastly different rest Europe.

Yep couple supporting also known nurses pysier vacine face throat swell up, telling people anecdotal evidence dangerous, know dangers kind information people getting anti vax, report correct channels cource covid still far dangerous. none EU countries could produce vaccines

BioNTech German Janssen Belgian subsidiary J&amp;J, although obviously joint efforts US companies.

CureVac/Bayer would first ""100% EU"" vaccine trial (due March) succeeds executing today?

The COVID virus data safety vaccinated twice different vaccines.

It's probably fine, health approvals work way. Vaccinate world first? That‚Äôs soonfucking dumb, know sounds terrible, take care ppl help others! nation help countries can‚Äôt afford mRNA ones country can‚Äôt even vaccinate citizens adequately! think point stay-at-home *on top of* measures achieves little. So, make people stay home instead going schools, universities, bars, restaurants mingling people would achieve little terms curbing virus spread, already closed non-essential functions society banned gatherings, making people stay home achieve anything more. sort makes sense situation thing people go walking outdoor activities without people, unlikely cause spread. None describing relevant situation point time.

For starters, we're nowhere near close vaccinating whole population. shortages limited us vaccinating 14% population, places senior citizens first responders qualify, others addition essential workers people comorbidities. Take vaccine supply away point time, specifically denying at-risk populations getting vaccinated, remaining 20% population younger demographics. bunch data back up. Basically every case know may 4-5 cases. That's 112-140 million people may exposed 34-42% population. numerous studies around throughout pandemic including numbers put CDC.
Plus evidence people simply naturally immune. theory India, think people certain genes gives immunity. identified US also possible. know people seem unaffected virus whatever reason.
Or consider graphs would look like virus suddenly unable spread widespread immunity. think would look exactly like look now. That's is, stop playing denier.

I read pre-print paper year ago found coronavirus easily penetrated heart caused heart muscle lose elasticity conductivity. 

Looks like guys way ahead curve.

Every covid denier comes excuses, embarassing see parrotted absolutely connection justifty ignoring covid go back normal, guess what, covid care play pretend, keep does. Good points. Vaccines fully available May, latest looks like. means I‚Äôm burning mask That's AstraZeneca coming close meeting FDA criteria vaccine trial (they even bother apply), fumbling around serious adverse advent report FDA (and consequently restart USA trial), reporting multiple major trial errors. 

Then course AstraZeneca turned entirely ineffective South African variant, much country got rid supply. Meanwhile Pfizer Moderna produced data showing likely still work.

This messaging issue. Heartbreaking! hope vaccinations common sense precautions general public prevent deaths. Yep.

Sure see people double masking people certainly strict social distancing.

For example, know anecdotal, yesterday 1st relatively nice day area month country running first outdoor youth half-court basketball games (this replacing indoor games would normally winter). could almost literally see light bulbs going people's heads hibernating fear virus realize awful normalcy coming. Yeah second phase trial shows 50.65% effectiveness. That‚Äôs enough creating heard immunity even 100% population gets vaccinated. UK variant showed could become dominant 2-3 months. country probably got first cases weeks UK, 30% infections. South African variant around 5%. hope SA variant start spreading exponentially vaccines start making serious dent spread variants (hopefully month two). AZ vaccine effective against, could problematic quite quickly. Masks without social distancing basically pointless. Like get together 20 people hang inside four hours surgical masks going much anything. It'd probably safer go grocery shopping maskless non-distanced social gathering masks. definitely people *around world* would poison family member $400k.

FTFY year means something different young adult. pandemic happened age 30, would different age 25 35 (well I'm guessing I'm 35 yet) year same. miss stuff, yeah, stuff theory again.

High school college like that. four years lot look totally different. get one senior prom. get one two years varsity sports (my school mainly Juniors seniors them). school theater, usually start way chorus freshman get lead last year. moment miss due lockdown, can't get back way adults can. arguing premise article statistics European Union, gather statistical information country members compare.

I‚Äôm genuinely curious high death count would flu every death happened within 30 days positive case counted flu death asymptomatic people tested. It‚Äôs pretty mind blowing people don‚Äôt think combination two things leads inflated numbers cases deaths.

Gloss want, long trend remains, people remain optimistic, rightfully so. Yes, although said pursue FDA approval pending results trial makes interesting... may try all.. I'm really sure exactly they're thinking. know they're earnings call moved March 2nd believe suspect they're going sort UK results finalized then. previous ones released end January interim results final. ... actually makes wonder ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs it‚Äù them... mean, addition financial compensation.

OR

2) remains vague, people shit he‚Äôs giving specific dates things occur. 

I think Fauci isn‚Äôt perfect, whatever criticized. become public facing official pandemic, symbolic US efforts drive infection/endorse proper protection. option says nothing all, people critique saying ANYTHING. 

The dude ain‚Äôt perfect, idk folks want doing, whatever does, 2 months later you‚Äôll back saying ‚Äúwell wasn‚Äôt right either.‚Äù father age group vaccine since phase 1. problem system fir getting enough appointment, isn‚Äôt entitled it. Thank Even though I'm 26, cousin still high school class getting FUCKED right now. Class 2020 got graduation parades, A-List celebrity commencement speakers, outdoor graduation, even outdoor prom summer vacation.

Wait... die covid vaccine? happened explosion cases supposed get result Super Bowl parties? spent weeks predicting would happen also responsible acknowledging didn't. That‚Äôs true all. I‚Äôm sure would make assumption. Upper East neighborhood full young families.  guess need FDA approval 110 million doses US ordered. hard get FDA approval without trial US, vaccine got yet.

Plus, FDA approval good selling point South/Central America, Asia, Africa etc. adopted would immediate impact. profit dies mean somone losing money. covering costs little extra case. profits still hold money. 70 year old neighbors grandparents AZ, nothing sore arms UK bad said could drop PCR, adopted many organizations least US. Yeah, that‚Äôs really glaring issue me. religious treatment Fauci gets something encouraged. Science meant questioned constantly evaluated; *not* religion. Sure.. Sample concentration needed detection vs what's needed spread. like asking single sperm fertilize egg vs detecting crime scene. compare.  saying fuck everyone preexisting condition frontline workers. it‚Äôs goal


Many people won‚Äôt take vaccine


Vaccinating vulnerable main goal thinking there‚Äôll annual Covid/flu vaccine cocktail still need separate? I‚Äôm perplexed people think things become normal summer get worse fall... like wtf things get better continually vaccines progress production costs vaccine irrelevant. made point country funded vaccine get first dibs. look breakdown tax money comes logic dictates rich people get first dibs.

You also made point selfish game. logic could blame rich bidding price vaccine?

Your final point US purchases vaccine ultimately helps poor countries providing free vaccines them. Selling vaccines rich many multiples production cost could likewise ultimately used subsidize cost vaccine poor. tricky part lots countries seen type curves, although different restrictions.  Latest headline: *Macron found quasi-ineffective*  Honestly, minority people actually abiding rules guidelines lockdown. People argue want efficacy restrictions, there‚Äòs little compliance basically enforcement, doesn‚Äôt matter. 

Germans generally (understandably, historical reasons) weary authorities meddling private lives, want uphold ‚ÄûGrundgesetz‚Äú (constitution) everything else, they‚Äôre also open state trying enforce lockdown. know popular opinion downvote away don‚Äôt give crap - don‚Äôt want take Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. I‚Äôm sorry, know it‚Äôs selfish, several reasons I‚Äôm really going change view it. Pfizer Moderna increasing production, able get one May? looks like despite working school won‚Äôt able get one rest age group I‚Äôm temp won‚Äôt give eligibility letter. Yes, I‚Äôm furious. Top Gun 2 theatres is! Agreed. think we'll see another winter 2020-21 style wave year  government spent entire pandemic cautious enough hundred thousand dead that. I'd rather overcautiousness really want summer restrictions all. Astrazeneca: joke you? get entire planet vaccinated, take longer due lack leadership self-proclaimed ""world leaders"".

It goal unless want every years less. give link source stats? im curious countries well Yep, taking bath toaster tonight. Fuck entire world. I'm done. UK still better Belgium even that, really speaks terribly gone Belgium. UK even included priority group

I Young (vulnerable) people included group 6

So what's question got that? Still really understand it. Pfizer stored refridgerated temperatures 5 days AZ little data regarding efficacy elderly. Don‚Äôt take word it. ask [Dr. you‚Äôre one cult here. Theres lot mabyes article, lot hardcore solid undeniable proof. Oxford currently researching effect immune systems mixing vaccines, hopefully soon know. SA U.K. hype crapping editors need paychecks! say article regulators spread fake news? see EMA approved vaccine ages German Health Ministry refuted 8% claim newspaper. actually sounds like regulators job. 

You said weren‚Äôt guessing literally say ‚Äúpeople allowed speculate‚Äù. Like, what? saying regulators haven‚Äôt approved AZ fast enough isn‚Äôt guess. start hinting motive despite privy internal communication, well guess unless you‚Äôre mind reader top scientist. 

Since you‚Äôre scientist, defer nuts bolts vaccine suggest political hypothesis needs evidence. someone spent career intersection research policy (literally half research capacity half working econ regulatory policy federal government), claims sound incredibly far fetched me. know. good sign Lol ok. Whatever cult wants think. mean arguing cheating worse, weird argument have, US certainly among top group. blows mind people make claims like US saintly child among sinning nations already confirmed Florida, Georgia, Texas straight cooking books lying public reality states. overall discussion, though, United States one worst responses pandemic crisis attached world objectively true. Anyone thinks otherwise delusional needs expect country. Plus, maybe backed claims sources instead pulling numbers ass people would take little seriously. According data Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC), number deaths attributable Alzheimer‚Äôs dementia pandemic jumped 12% Minnesota alone. Leaders Alzheimer‚Äôs Association, Minnesota-North Dakota note reasons increase among 99,000 Minnesotans living Alzheimer‚Äôs may vary could include: reduced access physicians health care pandemic, disruption daily routines care provided family members caregivers, simple toll social isolation. image pretty descriptive. Lousy spring 2020, high number deaths, strict lockdown, numbers well summer.  

Then, people head holidays, become infected, SAGE calls lockdown September ""Circuit breaker"" - ignored - rates climb - semi lockdown November followed - ""must open save economy festive shopping"" - Labour want cancel Christmas, six weeks carnage.  


Only now, 7 weeks partial lockdown, vaccine rollout seeing possibility relief..

UK seems struck nearly ideal balance killing people failling help economy. legitimately asking question? Well answer yes. Trump plan, literally executed administration. fact, minor changes, Biden‚Äôs vaccine rollout plan Trump‚Äôs. ‚ÄúdAtA‚Äù trump card every conversation you‚Äôre winning in, dude. never purported reporting kind study results. called making observations, forming hypothesis. boner ‚ÄútHe ScIEnCe,‚Äù know can‚Äôt GET data anything things first. alone end pandemic. can‚Äôt get entire planet vaccinated


That goal go back normal chiming here: employers really care school. use degree towards angle - ""I set requirements (GE major/minor) needed meet order graduate college within time frame(5 years). order complete degree, learn time management skills, independent study strategies, cooperation teammates group projects, maintaining healthy school/work/life balance."" 

For least, important stuff school teaches harder train. always train someone something, everyone learn/work well others.

Christmas, EVERY state saw uptick two weeks later. 

This consistent across midwestern states, regardless whether virus already peaked not, regardless mask policy. consistency factors upticks states happened two weeks major holidays. weird thing is, according lot sources polls, UK one pro vaccine countries Europe.

So I've got pretty intense personal experience this.. also spent lot Rehab time reading new developments research insights. 

The downvotes (and trolls) Reddit pretty small potatoes compared I've real life. Except does. mundane virus damaged father-in-law's heart. Needed valve replacement messed quality life last twenty years. Canad√° actually develop multiple vaccines, one started Phase 3 trials November. Medicago/GSK vaccine quite promising, it‚Äôs 3-4 months leaders like Pfizer/Moderna, like Germany‚Äôs CureVac. glad India helping countries dire situation. [this recent Putin meeting indoors one Russia‚Äôs important public health officials, maskless, bit culture shock Nowhere article posted say German health ministry repeated factually unsubstantiated claims. opposite fact, said claims true speculated newspaper got wrong. review:

 1. German newspaper reported unsubstantiated claims 65+ efficacy
2. Despite claim, European Medical Agency recommended AZ adults. 
3. German health authority says there‚Äôs enough data 65+ (a true statement) speculate newspaper got facts wrong. 

The German Health Ministry never seems repeated incorrect claim vaccine 8% effective. German Health Ministry never seems claimed AZ doesn‚Äôt work older adults. said wasn‚Äôt enough data, confidence intervals cited article, appears true statement. 

Again, Occam‚Äôs razor. likely story German newspaper engaged sloppy science journalism based misunderstanding confidence intervals. Even so, didn‚Äôt stop vaccine getting appropriately approved EMA timely fashion. health agency far article says ever repeated 8% efficacy coins. 

Never assume malfeasance incompetence likely story. Overly cautious. odd. Reddit sockpuppeting AZ vaccine. Anti vax groups, companies opposed cost price vaccine, state disinformation, vaccine nationalists. proper state. One thing know sure amazing age.

Yeah. always gonna work out.

Honestly idea China reacted way. /S late. Going EMA advice catastrophic decision based prejudice ,bias political spite. Shocking. Errrr no, highly doubt it. Data could come saying makes live 10 years longer people would still refuse it. Thats disinformation looks smear campaign do. sub guilty.

Oxford vaccine developed university, onus 'publish die'. every little thing vaccine published immediately. ni regard commercial ramifications.

Compare company lioe Pfizer, take good headline figure, release stop data there.

They vastly different know far Oxford vaccine this. Well healthcare officials Germany already confirmed AZ good vaccine, think much case media creating click-bates political move. Governments Europe one goal: vaccinating population quickly possible efficient safe vaccine. mean fair expensive least -- speaking purely vaccine technology terms-- MRNA sexy *new* platform. 

I expecting article another thinly dressed AZ bashing piece feel overall pretty balanced reasonable IMO. 

I agree media horrific throughout pandemic though; there's politicization vaccine front sure, bolstered national pride areas, doubt vested financial interests also stirring pot. results ultimately deterimental-- vaccine preferentialism see ongoing now. 

We're currently stage vaccine understanding like compare smartphone megapixel race; poll average person street might want one highest number, thinking it'll surely mean better pictures. 

To degree think blame people thoughts ; way articles presented things, think difference 80% efficacy 90% efficacy, like significantly higher chance death rather 17 people 20,000 getting blocked nose light fever day

It's first time general public watched competitive vaccine trials, mRNA vaccines announced high efficacy first point anything else deemed 'inferior'. Nevermind differences trial protocols, study demographics etc. Hopefully time, data comes shows vaccines, vaccines, help preferentialism really issue. obviously understood vaccines work, first actual evidence conclusion important?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, said connection vaccine, citing underlying conditions. hilariously stupid consider count Covid part, unvaccinated people also made choice. understand minority people can't take it, going them? Lock well since they're apparently dangerous? make exception? I'm saying really willing enforce segregation this? people getting vaccinations favour. They're getting vaccine protecting themselves, individual thing.

And know we'll never 'crush' virus right? virus, war. Mutations happen immunity occur shots risk also simple infection many others. Herd immunity reached, go back forth year year infections still happen. Since vast majority deaths risk population, focus booster shots protecting them, revaccinating everyone every year that's logistical nightmare even possible.

And want talk who's prolonged pandemic? every single rule implemented slow spread. Focused protection would've allowed protection risk people virus made way rest population developing natural herd immunity without horrible consequences lockdown, reliance vaccines herd immunity would protect risk people (who hospitalizations hospitals would likely alright). nope, insisted slowing vaccines. Also, clarify people immediately want covid vaccine anti vax. taken vaccines, one inject essential oil nutters. trust injecting something rushed, feel that's wrong dangerous. really want discriminate people trusting you, even know say. 2,500 per day glossed Reddit couch heroes. think vaccines delivered 'promised' (this wrong, - contracts say best efforts, *entirely* different)? Canada probably secured 9:1 ratio offered low price. UK Israel bought less paid - got early. Shocking, really...

If want cheap, get slower. That's simple fair truth. UK pumped much money Covax: poorer countries get vaccines sooner. Canada, course, dipping back Covax supply supposed go poorer countries.

Maybe, maybe, guys (partly) hard time because... oh, countries blocked exports vaccinations. think would better worse Germany nationalised Pfizer? UK done AstraZeneca?

Really odd advocate nationalising pharmaceutical companies pandemic. Given Canada pharmaceutical company creating Covid vaccines, seems like would literally injure Canada. true health policy seems quarantine healthy let sick weak free roaming around. Tree fiddy always value judgment behind political decisions. Sapiens author Yuval Harari noted, science merely gives us information. doesn‚Äôt tell us it. Agree disagree. 

Anti Vaxxers get fucked care think natural normal people would reluctant faced disinformation supposedly reliable sources. get news Reddit , would assumed number wayy higher. 2 vaccines made Canada. still stage 3 clinical trials. mRNA viruses fun Germany (Pfizer) US (Moderna) entirely novel. great work well made fast.. risk paid off. Where's representation ? üòÇ take consideration 3 million causes death, 500 thousand one cause hell lot people. Covid also lockdowns, masks, various implementations hinder virus still wrecked havoc.

It's fallacy try undermine severity something looking something worse. like going back 1918-1920 saying ""Oh Spanish Flu killed 50 million people...ppffft there's like billion deaths+ since start existence, 50 million nothing, stop fearing"".

Please try considerate type. wins messaging? pernicious.

Then maybe give people special access vaccines based wealth? That's actual issue, messaging. mean, *you* get nothing die regardless, so... wonder what's worse...the virus damage quarantine done psyche many. That's mainly relatively people vaccinated four weeks ago. half been, we'd expect around 400 people hospitalised headline figures. Genuinely happy read good news COVID-19 USA. Why?   One thing want see ton effort convincing people get vaccines right now. perks want wait, give medicine waiting year. certainly would elderly grandma. Suddenly‚Ä¶imagine many people could survived trump removed first impeachment population Taiwan, officially known Republic China, approximately¬†23.57 million, spread across total land area 36,000 km2; seventeenth densely populated country world, population density 651 inhabitants per square kilometer.

Taiwan literally best pandemic response, much better New Zealand similar city population sizes US higher density. made difference compared US? competent government, closing border early, quarantining arrivals, universal masking (until even today, contact trace isolate, compliant citizens. US biggest surveillance apparatus whole world literally failed job know virus arrived could contact trace anyone. rely Google Apple add phones. What... tech existed since Snwdn leaks ""co-traveller"". still 100% effective severe infection (ie hospitalisation). 

So no, that‚Äôs incorrect. Well people really refusing vaccine think personally go back line.. strange countries differ, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden Norway seems much less issue example Germany. COVID lockdowns hardly global phenomenon, either. Crap, they're even national phenomenon. I'm Oklahoma furthest went lockdowns closing bars dine-in restaurants 11pm, restriction last long halted court. even mask mandate. Shocking india going on

Everyone deserves access poor BS unnecessary. sucks enough supply everyone wants one vaccinated today. However, grateful offered persons professions required closest physical contact people. 

And yes, appreciate grocery store workers, negative Nancy. one jab though. remember seeing something Israel Pfizer reducing hospitlisations 98% give take. guess second shot pfizer boosts reduction hospitlisations. one longest lockdowns planet.  


 
How lockdown longer places? went full lockdown March 19th. Yes comparing cases tricky, given different strategies around testing. Looking deaths might comparable, although way different countries count differ well. saying lockdowns effect though. saying work instituted thing going shit lifted things looking better way prove it. Thank you. Obviously people risk death see people die may develop PTSD. However, explain long Covid example brother, mild complaints never even came close hospitalisation. almost died, would make sense. life never danger, hardly trauma develop PTSD. exactly things pretty close. regards want do.

Again, claims sound incredibly far fetched me. know.

You're commenting post reports AZ vaccine effective elderly, point lot unfounded claims not, repeated media health bodies alike. No, wrong here. never said anything citizens within country, treated unfairly differently purely based income. 

As citizens residents US, government duty care moral obligations us, citizens nations. ignore point want, it‚Äôs pretty central attempt distort statement something wasn‚Äôt.

B117 real thing. United States poised outrace it. countries may be. Im sorry, that‚Äôs article quote says. 

One single (seemingly political) newspaper reported incorrect claim. media sources (like Politico) regulators refuted explained claim. 

Let‚Äôs look full paragraph partially quoted Friday 29 January EMA given vaccine conditional authorisation use ages 10 February World Health Organization recommended vaccine adults. Although EMA warned data 55s limited,3 clear single digit effectiveness Handelsblatt‚Äôs story baseless.

Within four days newspaper sorry published EMA approved vaccine ‚Äúin ages‚Äù. exactly timely? Would three days better? Although EMA warned data 55s limited,3 clear single digit effectiveness Handelsblatt‚Äôs story baseless.

So EMA correctly points (based presented confidence intervals article) limited data age group, actions make clear efficacy higher newspaper reported. 

So exactly EMA wrong here? seems like party fault article. regulators wrong here, seriously? regulator repeat 8% claim say basing decision claim? so, that‚Äôs present article shared.  nose right there. enough cough sneeze tissue. I'm saying extract somewhere.
I'm saying sitting front somebody testing.

Canada small population 39 million people (7 million children vaccinated) contend tiny number infections compared population size. 8 million children Canada. article states low vaccination list low transmission little symptoms. exclude total population purpose analysis. brings 31 Million Canadians country vaccinated end September.

Vaccinations begun ramp big time Canada. recieved largest shipment recorded. number expected increase further. look interview Happens host Carol Friday, Anita Anand echoed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's earlier reassurances Moderna Pfizer hold end bargain send **six**million vaccine doses Canada end **March**, 70 million end September.

An interesting tid bit numbers factor Moderna Pfizer. AstraZeneca Johnson johnson LOOKING like approved Canada soon.

By end march 6 million vaccines. Now, reported 1 shot nearly effective second shot. 6 million shots means 6 million Canadians vaccinated end march early April, we're currently receiving vaccines using supply got cut Pfizer upgrade plant. go ahead slap couple million onto 6 million end march early April. Roughly 8 9 million.


Then, April, receive course vaccines. 

""By end [the first quarter fiscal period March 31], see six million vaccines country. end [the second quarter June 30], see 26 million aggregate. end [the third quarter Sept. 30], 70 million vaccines aggregate, every Canadian wishes vaccinated access vaccine.""

Using rough numbers make rough estimate much total Canadian population vaccinated April/May. June Vaccinations Canada 26 million we've already won. let's focus that.

26 million june. means April may roughly anywhere around 14 18 million vaccinated Canada. That's half population Canada essentially. little half include children. excluded logical reasons stated earlier.

So, falls line said. April/May. successfully encircled virus enough people vaccinated trap virus zones theres enough hosts available infection transmission virus survive.

This true advantage suppressing infection numbers early late on. require much less win it. Covid would killed many, many millions short amount time (which would completely destroy health services kill many working front line too) zero lockdowns precautions taken. considered vast majority people caught virus yet death toll 500k? There's 328m people America, approximately 28m covid confirmed, paper 92% virus (appreciate asymptomatic people noone knows numbers those). Imagine would happen health care system percentage closer 20% population lockdown/precautions? 50%? 

The requirement urgency introduce lockdown reduce spread virus thousand times important needing ban fast food people cant regulate amount eat (not mention unclear extent unhealthy food would need regulated government order see health benefit, whether even possible without totalitarian state). They're equivalent way.  smell defamation lawsuit? makes complete sense considering American culture.  know crossover reaction, know helps. Seasonal coronavirus antibodies also cross react Covid, far tell protective (recent common cold infections found protect Covid infections. jury still whether might reduce symptom severity.) U.S.A passed 500k deaths virus. Jesus...lets slow get 600k Yeah, that's it. too.

It's people brag never taken precautions, they're getting lots reinforcement. Seeing elderly family, sniffles, affect hardly anyone, living normally brainwashed. media. Lots upvotes.   Yes! Wooo hooo! Let's get shots arms!!

My sleeve ready! one covid real. Many people make ICU point, severely debilitated covid. people ecmo weeks, even months, floor full patients hiflows weeks getting better. 
Coming RT NYC, numbers coming down, patients leaving crawls pace make all. totally pro-vaccine also totally anti-lockdown. They've literally mapped you, lockdown ends June. years lol, studies vaccine children going now. Many European countries higher deaths per capita. Italy, Spain, Belgium, UK, etc. significantly higher. US 1,542 per million, Belgium - 1,885

Idk narrative started US somehow worst. It‚Äôs simply true. even talking about? 

If lost sense smell serious case Covid, experience change mind masking? restrictions? basically Israel. Masks, social distancing. Masks negatively impact economy, social distancing does. think SD go away first, masks come soon after. I've taping since day 1. Anyone else use glasses fogging strategy detect leaks improve fit?  Age far bigger risk factor pre-existing conditions. Yes, selfish, prolonging pandemic, yet furious someone else delaying. Impressive. country didnt lockdown best Europe? fuck bullshit really isnt helping? cannot believe number healthy, level headed people I've talked like, ""::shrug::, get it, get it"". 

There's concerted push along move public opinion toward idea young people basically immune virus. started saying ""most deaths old people"", became ""young people get mild symptoms, basically flu them"", stretched ""actually even bad flu, like mild cold sniffles."" doubt young people barely experience anything, gets emphasized much many people think norm, suspect average case young person probably light.  

I also find funny young people keep talking vaccine side effects kicking ass, yet think getting covid would nothing. immune response one gave kind symptoms would probably bad. What‚Äôs TMZ? really. UK far highest increase case rates lockdown due new variant factors, mind UK tests 3x much US. Exactly point also let strains example spread like wildfire allows mutations mutations escape vaccine immunity. Hi you. apologise initial comment caused significant debate. 

I wanted clarify. anti-vax. fact, exact opposite, initial comment exasperation inaccurate claims AZ vaccine lead anti-vax sentiment.

I appreciate speculating media campaign AZ vaccine could considered conspiratorial (in fact, that's mentioned tin foil hat). certainly feel though underlying rationale behind overwhelmingly negative reporting vaccine. previously stated could simply vaccine nationalism. 

If doubts pro-vax attitude, please feel free scroll post history. need scroll past volumes r/Liverpoolfc posts though. I'm owed nothing. going tag people specialists, owe something sub they're tagged in. domestic vaccine manufacturing ability got pushed back line delivery suppliers. favor reopening things, encouraging folks go they've vaccinated.

I suppose country we'd never able force people adhere common sense guidelines, least make clear risk causing/participating superspreader event them.  Covid November. Couldn‚Äôt smell *anything* , including bleach vinegar, 2+ months. sense smell 30% used be. light scented candles, can‚Äôt smell them, put (unlit) right close nose, smell little bit. miss smelling things!! Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Scotland's policy follows grander UK strategy. Vaccinations started two risk groups, 80's health workers. Recently we've (UK) moved vaccinating 70s. 50s, rest. Really ??? I've heard perhaps half dozen cases significant side effects BioNTech. zero AZ. 

Possibly AZ total count ""***more""*** side effects minor, that's moot. person comments nasty asshole. even try arguing him. miserable childhood mad people actually enjoying childhood this. No, hospitalizations deaths peaked mid late Jan here. comments officials seem justification going buying enough Oxford/AZ vaccine. yes, going end costing lives Ireland expects 600k J&amp;J Q2 around 55 million doses, seeing one dose good 110 million doses vaccines roughly equivalent amount vaccines EU receive entirety Q1 mean Australians British good relationship similar culture wouldnt suprised like uk open oxford AstraZeneca flu season exceptionally soft Sweden 2019/2020 2018/2019 Norway normal, believe. compared statistics Denmark month back could definitely see different hit seasonal flu epidemic two countries. statistics simple. I'm sure average age wealthy district far higher poor one instance. Mission accomplished. Huh pretty damn effective ""quasi ineffective"" vaccine Macron idiot, reasons shitting vaccine. Nah I'm good. even actually news Facebook ridiculous trust biased bullshit. Facebook fucks sake. could copy paste answer change, making effectively meaningless. Kind like fortune teller. Yes definitely I've seen alot people disgraced eu weirdly united leave remainers worry, still free stay house forever! Yep, posted similar comment another thread - definition symptomatic infection different across trials, comparison common definitions real-world data much higher sample sizes like important.

It's going trials, assume BnT/Pfizer vaccine going effective! Sanofi sleeping around make shortcomings ""don't believe international data"". common countries conduct separate trials medicine, [they could different degrees efficacy side depending genetic make-up population.

That said, Japanese government could done much better job preparing distribution vaccine. Frenchman can't anything agree statement. entire government belongs trash. take governments making mistakes - everybody officials far perfect - doubling bullshit moving goalposts (""we vaccinating slowly purpose!"", ""we want vaccinate world, EU!"", ""it's meant along"", etc.) makes us look like complete idiots. fact article published 4 days ago mean includes data 4 days ago. article explicitly says looks first wave pandemic. it‚Äôs anti-vaxxers, it‚Äôs pro-American groups don‚Äôt want see anything non American win? Where‚Äôs phone you‚Äôre using made kind sir? I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs whole list go awful straw man attempt data pretty raw think looking Yes, fallen dramatically among elderly rose among young, see graph researchers speculated young started dropping precautions soon elderly vaccinated, leading surge infections. 60 year olds outnumber 60+ year olds new hospitalizations. agree with. would call anything since mid-summer lockdown. one, people, least Reddit, like act like wild west since day one. 

Honestly, wish like people say was. Maybe could avoided serious depression anxiety issues last spring... exactly know what‚Äôs going happen next 9 months?

How you? statement actual statement regarding masks sound like he‚Äôs giving vague statement conservative estimate like entire duration pandemic? Yes, cases dropping rapidly. fire people don‚Äôt wash hands, too. Ahh ok. wonder difference would made short term though. NL get close 8 million doses Pfizer Q2 alone rumors say even doses due production upgrades. *crossing fingers Norwegian NL* reached peak US 3300 death day (7 day average) 1900. going right way shit still sucks much better place month ago.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think things might moved smidge since  Another reason could us glasses luxury wearing mask loose bridge nose. crimp thing HARD try keep fogging down. 80% efficacy 90% efficacy

That actually significant trying stop pandemic requires somewhere 70-90% herd immunity. know two women total children past age 30, 35 oddly enough. One tried 10 years child, issues I'm aware of.

Every single case besides two ended infertile. 

Just theoretically possible babies 40s mean probable. Statistics anyone's side 35. think going see 2-3 million per day within week two. think pent supply storms Pfizer said would doubling capacity next couple weeks.

I think going open vaccinations groups people end February provide enough demand. front page Sub. Real world data 1.1million people Scotland. Englands data due soon expected show same, 10's millions data points.

There concerted PR effort moment rubbish non profit vaccine push profit vaccine. saw details twitter account someone knowledgeable me, 90 120 days line, shows vaccine efficacy 32%. mean imperative get 2nd dose 90-day mark? (61 90-days= 78%). Otherwise, efficacy drop dramatically?

Overall, great news. Hopefully, assure countries may issue AZ vaccine indeed work. Well, minimum participation wouldn‚Äôt problem. However, whilst agree simple majority big decision shouldn‚Äôt enough - clear reason DC didn‚Äôt add sure remain gonna prevail introduced condition question wouldn‚Äôt settled side could claim rules written them. mean I'm England there's indication reluctance take AZ jab. 90% people age 70 taken vaccine. one gets choice vaccine, accept we're given one problem that. article chime reality. make question leadership even Presidents like Macron fall this. 

If briefed wrongly imagine else got wrong? vaccine teams now? Like pick favorite vaccine? Please tell isn‚Äôt you‚Äôre suggesting? forgot death lag sorry necessarily. Remember, first dose 3 weeks you‚Äôre supposed get booster Pfizer shot. 

Also I‚Äôm sure Scotland‚Äôs policy specifically, weren‚Äôt necessarily giving vaccines evenly across age groups. giving AZ younger people (like they‚Äôve elsewhere Europe) started vaccinating elderly first Pfizer available, could get different rates hospitalization two vaccines identical efficacy. Actually, take surplus. surplus take surplus Pfizer ""optional additional doses"". Anti-vaxx propaganda Getting second dose trial Tuesday. Glad see fully enrolled. Actually cases Mexico dropping fast well. seems case places world moment, luckily. sure expecting look bad prevalent among young healthy getting vaccinated now. Deaths lagging indicator take 6-8 weeks.

They done studies specifically vaccinated population numbers Pardon? Yes reliable hospital efficacy numbers since sample sizes much bigger

 Also remember BnT tested symptomatic cases Oxford tested everyone sure efficacy directly comparable wait learn World War 2! real. Send Chile, I'll happily get tomorrow. telling many US states ineffective slowing covid extremely effective destroying society economy. Florida, South Dakota, Texas better comparably dense places much much stricter lockdowns. Without contact tracing, border closures, quarantining, shit currently complete waste time 

What? woods variants eventually escape vaccine. It‚Äôs learning live risk. know it‚Äôs overall better lower classes, find funny Canadians would normally shit America healthcare. Nowhere post say life you‚Äôre 30. said My. life experiences. love life now, loved then, I‚Äôm certainly 18-22. make life. Number 1. reasons agree complicated.

1. Norway approximately two times smaller population Sweden (5.3 vs 10.2 milion). look absolute number reports always need keep mind twice higher numbers Sweden still relative level Norway. 
2. 12 000 reported official deaths (or of, depending statistic actually cite) COVID-19, excess mortality year 7000 baseline 2015-2019.
3. Excess mortality count COVID-19 deaths, counts deaths.
4. COVID-19 deaths disproportionally skewed towards frail elderly people, overall short life expectancy.
5. Baseline mortality Norway bit lower Sweden even normal years (source : ) - less 15 per 100.000 vs 17 per 100.000. means 1% excess mortality Norway 1% excess mortality Sweden, even correct population differences. 

And bottom Norway excess mortality 2020, Sweden 7.9% majority countries Europe 10, high 20% excess mortality. That's makes relatively low, big picture context. slope line different, though. Also, Pfizer finish enrollment September, analysis window opening October. Still took month get enough cases, even though cases swiftly rose (and wait another month... Thanks FDA). Pfizer also providencial site selection (they ran trial near Huntsville). I'm sure Novavax sites. racism, nationalism. comes immigration Japan really owe anyone anything. Racism Japan entirely different problem. weird stance considering government's efforts fix declining population working. Cases dissimilar late summer-early fall, Pfizer-Moderna took \~2 months get interim analysis. keep falling become hard yes. hit Biden‚Äôs springtime targets need 2M/day March 11, 3.1M/day April 30.  Wearing masks, socially distancing staying home there‚Äôs exponential uncontrolled spread worth saving lives? 500,000 people died needlessly due attitudes United States Oxford already developing that, say ready Autumn. booster shot. 

Covid likely keep mutating. Yearly boosters likelihood regardless vaccine have. I'm OK gaigin... ( *gaijin* refers outsiders rife undesirable characteristics) mean one, might well it. thus become American paradigm. pick, I'd rather masks social distancing, would make larger events possibility. said definitely want wear mask concert football game, hope mandates linger well past they're absolutely necessary. day rolling 900K day inauguration
777K 2 days inauguration Canada lots research. Canadian labs created Ebola vaccine. Pfizer vaccine developed Germany. American pharma companies troll academic labs looking research commercialize. Q3 4 months potentially EU benefit bit this, however realistically EU vaccinated existing capacity enough cover rest - perhaps serve rest world new variant vaccines come. I'm saying personal experience larger indoors social gatherings lately. think stems largely fatigue people caring even less months ago. point is, think extent herd immunity established I'm thinking proan higher levels social contact already exposed multiple times likely already disease running people infect 85 year old grandparents received first dose AZ vaccine 4 weeks ago. side effects feeling little sleepy 24 hours following jab. Poland hasn't, Guardians speculations sources.

The expected announcements tonight. far know, common human coronaviruses already circulating HKU1 OC43 (which probably one common colds past years) also inserted human population serious disease, possibly pancemic taking tons lives (Altough pandemic age commercial air travel obvoilsy different). 

So basically: know yet present 50 100 years now. Despite called SARS, may well bucket OC43. made claim december 8th. Cant really fault seeing future

and january 18th 2 days inaugiration rolling 7 day 777K. again, cant see future.  Knowing awful Trump handled everything else smart low ball knowing details, especially learning reserve.

conservatives get butt hurt someone team good job Gooooood good economy crash, I'm already seeing signs less work. government Canada deficit 400 billion dollars. Yeah everything fine Good good good Macron absolute disgrace Nope, Canadians want U.S. citizens, tourists unless critical job category... Can't say blame them...

As rest world...they discriminating U.S. valid logical reason... But, also can't blame them. gone beyond loud shorts loud mouths... ehat every country city state doing. Indefinite lockdowns end sight ridiculous. fourth person respond statement that's I'm snarky. already made statement bad (Cold) weather. going many people infected vs year ago etc changes transmission works. 

I'm also doubtful larger. may true November December now. I'm not. [The AZ trial conducted extensively throughout second half Macron's comments absolutely unacceptable Lol Suicides dont get reported suicides year two later. see it. already happening japan, country light lockdown. Also economic recession comes mental health issues suicides Found says starts Q3 basically worthless Sanofi lets us suspect it‚Äôs coincidence AZ one making money (a requirement Oxford‚Äôs AZ partner them, must done cost pandemic, make money it‚Äôs over). Well tbh reasoning behind got already data 65 wait data 65+ recommending them. Thats pretty ok move imo Media made vaccine bad... even sort address question lol Israel large ultra-orthodox community doesn‚Äôt give shit, don‚Äôt think people lining vaccinated. Didn‚Äôt also announce going help Pfizer/Biontech? Put prison next blonde lady gall tell truth data... think likes much. wear masks done years Japan SK. claim masks unjustified. agree dont know sure stops hospitalisations variants, equally boldly ridiculously claimed 'doesnt work variants' 'completely utterly pointless', despite study referring suggesting indeed T-Cell response.

A massive wave infection SA variant theres 10 live cases borders closed? Also ridiculously pessimistic.

There lot uncertainties, clearly made mind hyperbolic exaggerations embarrassed yourself. get bragging others misfortune. tell someone tells ""fuck you"" ""fuck too"" though. I'm happy Canada's inept vaccine rollout. point y'all went gloating begging really quickly. I'm sure snarky me? seems one cannot read. cold people tend gather indoors. People community actually frequent indoors gatherings late much larger scales. certainly household either live Tampa, work hospital middle Tampa. never lockdown.

That's necessary true. know people die covid comorbidities safe say some/if caused poor lifestyle. Look japan habr excellent metabolic health, covid barely made impact. think wearing mask year scar young child way thinking hard enough mean capitalism T, no? Big Pharma makes lot profits backs American people, pay fortune drug costs. gets funneled back R&amp;D lines pockets execs. Note Americans pay much drugs basically subsidize world regard.  

In net, means American pharmaceutical industry really successful. Like Moderna &amp; Pfizer, J&amp;J top that. know Western Europe AZ Russia Sputnik vaccine, China Sinovac. missing vaccines? South Africa strain shown, albeit small study, almost COMPLETELY evade AZ vaccine. Either team conducted study come forth admit screwed methodology study, UK inevitably massive wave infection soon lockdown released, South Africa strain. Infections Africa strain small numbers now, competition Kent strain removed AZ vaccines, Africa strain free playing field.

From one Moderna scientists worked bothered? half-baked self-proclaimed (excuse rudeness) experts stating vaccine 10% effective instilling panic. I‚Äôm tell FALSE. So, yes, loved ones received vaccine? You‚Äôre still protected!  last comment towards one specific. heard numerous media outlets claiming ‚Äú10%.‚Äù wasn‚Äôt even sure presented initially. told leaked screen FT presented fact. explanation still stands.  reiterate more, comments towards one specific, including original presenter. said ‚Äúexperts‚Äù plural. broad statement several media outlets &amp; ‚Äúexperts‚Äù reporting ‚Äú10%‚Äù efficacy misinformation. science still stands. that‚Äôs reflected real world case data it‚Äôs something keep eye worry much think. Even S. Africa seems fine days No, understanding. things happen commercial research time too. time pressure get something published justify yearly reviews maintain positions. 

Oxford published everything, warts all, academic research works. care commercial implications, care informing fellow scientists. Often things published people see went wrong.

Now, completely reasonable argument approach effective. 

Compare handling variant questions, Oxford immediately published small trial tell scientific world concerns effectiveness mild illness variants, allows policy makers make decisions notice data like study article. got mRNA vaccines lab study used claim effectiveness. anyone who's done science knows that, frankly, nowhere near useful real-world trial.

However, media reported ""AZ ineffective, Pfizer still works"" without engaging critical look different motivations two data presentations.¬† got way many anti-vaxxers germany Media pushes even sadly. everyone creates dumb ""facts"" without source people start believing.
Here seriously people believe politicians drink blood children stay young reptiles yeah...
I would take astrazeneca without thinking twice get offer. people read? likely cold: Stay inside stay warm. with? People live house anyone.

What do? Go out. One big change stay home jobs help lower Covid transmission well. bigger group socialize longer less likely Covid transmitted. here. Pandemic almost hit since I've working remotely even covid-19, 2020. financially great me, happy family understand people generation say rules big deal them.

What cannot life understand little empathy young, especially single people. United States prolonged period time think it‚Äôs going gradual. went grocery store last night packed. Six months ago insane lines get in, store empty inside. one gives shit anymore, major city east coast taking covid seriously. 

I think social distancing go masks. Try Lebanon then. would spark international incident. would poison myself. Unless live Tampa Miami area yet rate decrease covid19 hospital admissions -20.9% 7-day average. Since that's percentage absolute number, caused reduced total numbers. know, comparing country anyone immediate neighbors means arrogant Swede? /s NZ actually saw growth, 3.3% drop. final quarter last year bananas good. Dare jinx it? Hmmmm, maybe JHU guy right... talking weather issues? Pennsylvania iit cold lately cases still plummeted going country :/ 4000 people day dying where? canada 15000 deaths covid recorded last year. Flu typically kills 4000 - 8000 virtually flu last year (sourced flu watch, gov't site) . yes covid bad virus save people, underlying health issues, meanwhile damaging rest thd population pretty significantly makes sense. 

I'm bored government telling story I'm guessing Italy? not, somewhere else Europe? 80 year old white person US average live another 8 years. 44 million yen = $417,000 bucks... ""quite"" enough... Yeah better fuck covid YESSSS Yesterday lowest cases registered day PA since 10/26 :) Would rather social distancing masks, masks social distancing?

It looks like governments eventually lift one other, lifting both, they're already so. disagree think go time? ignorance scientific prices. Oxford released initial data inconsistent planned analysis, data distorted increase apparent efficacy context insufficient data time, moreover, there's whole, ""oops, accidentally gave wrong dose bunch people"", maybe data shows lower first dose effective?

They completely bumbled whole thing, known going get torn new one scientific community governments.

I'll trust vaccine FDA approved, thank you. fair, authors caution comparing two. read preprint yet, could multiple explanations disparity. E.g vulnerable given pfizer authorized first.

I think key takeway, rather translated one 'better' seem offer decent protection severe cases measured appropriate time point. someone working UK + US company, seen UK sales collapsed last year, least -20-30% business lost compared month year ago. Things started get slightly better around november-december.

However, sales US soared! never ever much business growth US gone last April-May! incredible. think that's US decided really lock much. Canada‚Äôs first (main) order vaccine China never came. kept money vaccine. retaliation Canada arresting Meng Wanzhou. Officially, it‚Äôs waiting customs. 

We N-95 mask shipments stolen international airports, Trump told 3M ship masks Canada. 

Trudeau wants us covered case anything happens one (or more) supply chains, again. got carried away. We‚Äôll donating ton vaccine... eventually. Well 200 million deliveries scheduled EU year, non-RNA vaccine EU residents get. stopped bothering Well ScoMo got one. gives warm glow inside. Crime we've got long way fall get even close 70s/80s. think people conceptualize bad things back then. West Bank occupied? open rest world? neighborhood Colorado even biggest surge people going out... fast food places utilizing grocery pickup options people also wore masks businesses followed local procedures hit nearly bad governor opened schools due public pressure closed county less two months.

Where people go, long, precautions taken change many get infected we've seen: New York hit first major consequences things like Sturgis rally. 

Given time amount infected alongside vaccinated tolls pandemic dropped side affect lockdown fatigue. Im germany. Half Country doesnt want Astrazeneca bc huge Problems Media trying sell stuff using really weird titles stuff create Opinions hope stuff like Move people Getting Vaccination.
Especially politics said get boost vaccine everyone got offers vaccination. Excellent news. Hope whole thing soon enough. Link saying per month, say specifically EU destined supply chain. There's huge difference 'we're waiting enough data' and, example, Macron declaring ""quasi-ineffective"" 65's. Remember: pretty much every previous pandemic, social end arrived long pandemic officially declared over. required life insurance? need secure loan? Why? nothing controversial here? estimate line people would guess today several months ago? doubt it. news come U.K. they‚Äôll see U.K. trying fake news effectiveness vaccine sell jabs (even though sold NFP) Long Island City pretty much war zone. Militants roam streets, cops surrendered, everything chaos. horrifying. /s 15 people contracted COVID US. Soon number go 0. virus disappear, like miracle.

/s felt sentiment. Lots prominent people trashed AZ vaccine world over, seemingly based little else country origin. Even countries like France, president proclaimed quasi-ineffective. get sentiment driving car probably probably dangerous coronavirus people 25 40. Life risks need look overall impact lockdowns vs benefit Yeah isn‚Äôt thing UK. Perhaps European countries politicians said stupid things. annoying siblings... got See Poe's Law. thing that, opinion, makes AZ vaccine completely utterly pointless, fact work variants. whole population vaccinated AZ, like UK be, soon UK releases lockdown, variants resistant vaccine take hold.

The South Africa strain shown, albeit small study, almost COMPLETELY evade AZ vaccine. Either team conducted study come forth admit screwed methodology study, UK inevitably massive wave infection soon lockdown released, South Africa strain.

AZ is, best, temporary solution. keep people safe months adept strain inevitably flourishes survival fittest. 

And **know** AZ vaccine reduces severe illness, hospitalizations death people get SA strain. hope. think. They're dangerously guessing assuming does, press dangerously reporting fact. Apples oranges several reasons (off top head).

Flu's R0 much lower SARS-CoV-2. [This 2014 talks changes R0 seasonal vs pandemic flu strains. take enormous increase R0 pandemic get hand- SARS-COV-2's R0 (was) higher flu numbers paper linked above.

[Here's Lancet talking pandemic coronaviruses vs 1918 2009 H1N1 flu. SARS-CoV-2 still ""wins"" far R0.

Besides that, SARS-CoV-2 causes mild/asymptomatic infection many people, contributed spread. longer incubation period flu well. we'd working 5% chance might still catch less 1% chance might die? vaccine would also lessen severity symptoms happen get it. risks way small start segregating people based whether want vaccine. That's morally bankrupt selfish.

500k registered deaths USA. people like ran Canada we'd something similar relation population.

People like selfish sociopathic trash there's it. miss gym much Chinese probably working this. They'll release infected animals lab farm investigators arrive. Case closed. Yeah sorry hear that. allergies? remember first day vaccine available UK two medical workers allergic reactions. sounds like maybe mild allergic reaction? Exponential growth never stays exponential. stabilizes. open states US brought home point. yeah go class bed it‚Äôs hard turn school mode. always feel like working homework. Disappointed cash-chan Room another one? gonna tasty one AZ haters come on.

I never thought I'd see day people treating vaccines like sports teams.

Glad see vaccines real world data looking promising. Yeah good way put ""if considered better getting covid must fucker feel like"" know 5 different people AZ vaccine barely noticeable side effects. Nothing like describing that's sure. Aussie here, cannot travel NZ. quarantine free travel one way: New Zealanders travel Australia quarantine free, way round. also hotel quarantine upon returning NZ. something special working work. Schooling school. we're expected home, safe space. hell fringe view concerned safety vaccine developed less year usually way 10? Things take time get right, given time expecting fine? whole ""your views danger everyone else"" downfall society. flourished diverse outlooks see things different ways, people interesting think things. Trying silence, lock away people think way want gonna lead somewhere pretty bland, well downright discrimination. Explain unvaccinated person puts vaccinated person risk disease immune that's whole point vaccine? Germany here, vaccinations everyone talks about? get some? Lol, no. 

The extra doses Pfizer scattered year, starting Q2. EU gonna get 300m doses different producers (mostly Pfizer, Janssen AZ) Q2 alone. no, Moderna ""not interested""; there's contracts, ""being interested"" not. Italy's updated plan, mirrors EU's plan distribution happens population basis. see, country enough doses vaccinate everyone late summer latest. real evidence disprove plan, making unsubstantiated claims personal opinions? Aren‚Äôt already seeing lots variants covid though? least there‚Äôs 3 major ones (S Africa, Brazil, UK) way would consider going US since 2010s. country becoming batshit crazy year year. Yeah, pharmacist.

My experience kinda unique. Scary part tongue swelling, could feel something weird going throat. began 1h30m jab. spent rest day monitoring situation case I'd go ER. 9pm began night shift alone pharmacy. Tongue swelling went bit assumed worst already past. Boy wrong. midnight swelling came back, heart pumping like crazy, chills fever never worried me, annoying. spent night awake, sweating like sauna feeling every heart beat skull. top priority make sure breathing compromised. daylight swelling went brain recovered ability think. point realized sweet irony night pharmacist consider maybe could use drugs ease experience. I'm dumb fuck...

I must mention flu like symptoms side effects, listed vaccine warnings. Tongue swelling listed side effect therefore adverse reaction, reported authorities make statistics recalculate risks such. likely able get second dose... UK ahead EU setting SAGE, building models combined epidemiology social psychology. lock late - locked precisely science told us would impact. 

Why UK perform well elsewhere? Population density, intensely busy airports public transport networks, particularly healthy population, population like told do... factors significantly important government measures. 

The thing I'll criticise UK government unnecessary complexity guidelines public. know, right? wins messaging? pernicious. last thing Dems need right class warfare plank platform. handing obvious social benefits rest civilized world easily affords cement position. plenty wealth go around--or really poorer every country G20? think export thing main issue people massive import vaccines. US basically telling EU supply USA, EU countries time. slowness Vaccine outroll prompted China Russia perform lot soft power Balkan region EU members, might (or not) lot implications willingness countries support sanctions either countries requested US. don‚Äôt know help any, may offer perspective. Dont get caught time life - 36 could pay enough relive younger years. glad experiences made mistakes learned all, absolutely feel right am
In best times life look forward older wiser. think ever camp in: type-specific vaccine fanboy it‚Äôs literal pandemic work well give vaccine ‚Äî agree one thing.

The media completely ridiculous stages throughout pandemic.

Palestinians occupied territories? Almost none. distinction important yet excuse Israel's responsability territory annexed. people go 88% time risk population. They're getting vaccines, massively go happens. shitshow I‚Äôve also pandemic response day 1 I‚Äôm 64. myopic focus Covid ‚Äúsaving lives‚Äù expense everything makes life worth living seemed soulless dystopian me. wanted tin foil hat, might consider AZ vaccine one sold profit.

Every dose AZ vaccine delivered loses someone money, media driven misinformation campaign might boost someone's profits. ‚ÄúHey we‚Äôre working! LETS CHANGE THAT!‚Äù 

What wrong you? will. level death society come tolerate. Vaccines updated every year mutations, needed. deaths massively reduced, get back normal I‚Äôm 36 sure young enough, I‚Äôve actually fine. thing raised narcissists experienced chaos fend left alone learning entertain young age. alone much effected all. complaint restricted gym hours weekends.

That said, absolutely feel bad everyone easy normal til first time faced real challenge see sometimes world isn‚Äôt great. keeping eye mental health friends childhood. I‚Äôm also concerned huge increase alcoholism people seem normalized drinking daily drinking lot. can‚Äôt ignore Israel occupying power actively preventing vaccines reaching Palestinians. comment anything? European Anglophobic disinformation campaign. Remember Pfizer isn‚Äôt given two doses 3 week separation intended thanks slump. everyone gets vaccinated effectively shielded severe COVID-19, really concerned first place. everyone wants vaccine opportunity get one, fail see would able largely return normal. obviously need assess potential waning immunity efficacy variants concern, don‚Äôt see need go extraordinary lengths try protect people basically choose get infected (and infect others). aside, come Toronto want see insane house prices. Hundred-year-old 1,000-square-foot semi-detached places selling well $1 million. Yep, like best Final Fantasy game. first one played. we've wearing masks UK since July-ish bunch stuff still allowed open ... look happened .. UK death rate per capita still higher US states joke lockdowns ...

The US death rate per capita even top 5 

If anything correlation schools opening cases spiking that's barely mentioned, like blame people wearing masks instead ...

Plus US welfare UK, really going blame people wanting eat get evicted homes? looks like 1 person downvoted this, found Macron. standards vaccine everyone sacrifice wellbeing completely isolate virus longer exists? terrible time response clear case capitalism us policy paved way vaccine come quick has. 

Innovation solution every problem, don‚Äôt fool simply want reason hate US. 

The standard living become high around world exclusively due capitalism, huge part facilitated US.

Personal sacrifice choice, don‚Äôt get force people make it.


The climate problems viruses always going saved innovation. many people used die sickness insanely minor injuries medicine cured 80% problem it‚Äôs worth it?

It‚Äôs amazing able wrong every point lockdown lol mum colleagues. Second Pfizer dose quite blow! taking need next day off! It‚Äôs estimated third Americans already currently immunity

And many know immunity part group get vaccinated. end, count vaccinations part determination ""get back normal."" happen many people already COVID probably people won‚Äôt want get shots

Every person know COVID wants shot... including me, SO, brother, friends. People gotten twice. us certainly think enough. Philippines here. Vaccines here, someone returned sender. money Surely Pfizer supposed given 3 week separation dosing? 

Do know AZ efficacy sa variant? Surely could make big difference. American news coverage AZ vaccine lot answer see deleted comment still get it.

If wanted sympathy I'd go someplace else cry it. seem understand point I'm making-- life fair going perfect.

People who're depressed can't live ""fun 20s"" college like movie need grow little perspective. bring personal experience illustrate point, try look sympathy. What's funny Pfizer even worse results terms antibodies AZ SA variant. AZ measured severe infection SA variant yet could well effective. 400k would change life live west coast Reading comments, knowing situation well others like me, think much young adults much people chaotic, unstable (not bad way, life fluid ie married/stable relationship stable, long-term employment actively trying move up) environment hit hard this. 35, single, changed careers graduating masters degree foreign country, feel much lot young adults experiencing. I'm sorry bad you, must least relief vaccinated now.

If mind asking, getting vaccinated even though 30s? work healthcare? something odd sub AZ vaccine discussion. Really odd. Good see confirmation it‚Äôs excellent vaccine. Eh, May. didn‚Äôt even start lockdown April 1. know dozen people got Pfizer vaccine said second dose gave strong reaction, first jab easy. I‚Äôm 64 never angry young people breaking rules. life force asserting itself. never agreed lockdowns appropriate response liberal democracy. Oxford build calculator show overall risk, like feel slightly better it: point exactly. 

If average citizen hears political leaders shit talking vaccine good can't blame getting worried thinking want sure they're getting ""best"" one.

It's one thing german medical regulator recommending AZ one 65's (which fair enough: cautious data age group limited first) Macron making statement vaccine ""quasi-ineffective"" age group horrendously irresponsible. He's qualified make call data back claim. Lack data positive automatically equate proof negative. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

But mental health side, think elementary kids OK. It‚Äôs ideal, peers listen = wear masks, still much wanting hugs probably point cognitively digest macro this. 

Now feel MS/ HS/ college kid would much difficult. short term, long term USA Europe, vaccinated international travel opens fully. that's case many states putting smokers front line get vaccinated? feel you, young adults. 35 here, moved another country master's degree, never walked bachelors degree, pumped master's degree front parents. ended watch generic ceremony away parents watched generic ceremony, isolated living alone realization trying find work another country. Fucking miserable. pharmacist working together, getting tested regularly. can't explain managed get infected zone got hit quite hard. Hope things calm bit, we're exhausted... though. 

1.25x Masks without social distancing psychological effects social distancing masks. go! really depends fast vaccinate. Lots countries still waiting significant deliveries weeks months ahead. would bit silly allow lots people get infected now, right mass vaccinations start. Bye. Scientists can‚Äôt 100% certain almost anything. Realistically, don‚Äôt think happen, think Fauci boat. 
But possible? Even it‚Äôs slightest bit, yes. news headlines claim ‚Äúmasks 2022‚Äù, even he‚Äôs trying say. go feel like personally needed see impact real world feel truly confident it. can't look go 'but hold real world?', hundreds thousands actual IRL human lives real gets. 

COVID really horribly tangible impact way live everyday lives. Maybe that's sometimes hard square data that's often based stuff like measuring neutralising antibodies lab, even logically know trust it. 

'We think stopped shitload people getting sick might die' kind of...feels meaningful emotional lizard part brain thinks mortality lot, least. 

Macron agenda, think necessarily change it, whatever. think there's possibility regular-person-healthcare-workers cautious signing slots already available -- people REALLY affected tangible effects COVID -- might reassured it. Fingers crossed eh. ignore them, take are: best guess bracketed confidence interval. stereotype, I'm Serbian live Serbia, situation grim comes spread misinformation.

But looking concrete data, here's research published American nationalism seems like likely culprit glasses protecting eyes. need least third covid infections happen yes see correlation magnitude, know case all. I‚Äôm 100% Going shame people wearing masks thing normalizes. amount shame thrown towards people didn‚Äôt wear masks grotesque, think it‚Äôs time balancing act bite. Shows us correlations.

It probably ""blablabla New Zealand blablabla countries actually lock down"" guy interesting thread matter. still speculative sounds plausible.  Japan super protective hard get crazy. grandfather Japanese (his parents immigrate country child). problems go back (because born fully Japanese family anyways) still hard go live want to. can't ask Japanese citizenship unless give citizenship home country (which never do), able get Visa allows stay long term, work property living family members physically Japan get documents fill forms done there, also need assure government place stay soon get country think hotels/airbnb valid (for long-term residency/work visa), means need family there. everything keep even ascendance Japanese. gave moving realized mother would never allowed live Japan (divorced father, Japanese side family) want take care gets older. I‚Äôm kind surprised. knew cases going drop, didn‚Äôt expect quickly. think it‚Äôs combination multiple factors. fair procurement vaccines still government itself. Germany, Spain, Italy, Canada, Netherlands equally well functioning healthcare systems NHS far behind sufficient number vaccines. getting quote numbers from? can't find linked article, looking wrong place? perhaps coming mentioned research ? info morning highly relevant you‚Äôd like good news: AstraZeneca confirmed 100% protection severe disease, hospitalization death primary analysis Phase III trials 22 days first dose. trials done UK, Brazil South Africa.  clarify, data cut study 12/7.

Mods, something done future? many duplicative posts subreddit major statement like made. I‚Äôd like think so. quick look twitter would imply otherwise.  Possible, probable. seriously misreported. Also, Fauci known realistically pessimistic predictions. Please reserve term 'liquid gold' breastmilk. call vaccine is, vaccine; produced lab. Thanks True. sufficient numbers refusing cause significant number stockpile. expected liberal mask paradise like california. really hoping end 2021 things go back like before. AstraZeneca, Anglo-Swedish pharma? 

Yeah British people like EU must hate company reasons.  mf political. inconsistent. Maybe Trump right along.  Shit, I've moved 7 times since last doctors (20ish years ago!). 

Do need get registered (which can't done online look it) healthy 40+ers able book directly? vaccine top trumps game media politicians seems playing maddening. two trials conducted different ways different end points. 

Both vaccines demonstrably highly effective preventing illness death. see real world data coming weeks. schools open, though, it‚Äôs rich white lids choose go back. many open districts, including NYC, Chicago, suburban district south, majority low income kids kids color choose stay remote learning. opening families reassurance it‚Äôs safe won‚Äôt really fix that. Yes right, knew I'd overlooked something. better way sum would say government prioritised clinical risk, either age health condition. Though debate number conditions included, varying degrees asthma instance. Great article downvoted mass conspiracy posters ‚ÄúCushty. time next year, Ryu, we‚Äôll miwwionaires.‚Äù ‚ÄúNice one, Daiju. Nice one.‚Äù ‚ÄúUncle Akira!

Society; cool, anyway... standard announcements fed press ""sources"" course day evening press conference. also discussing Commons afternoon.

I would surprised actual plan different article BBC already. Science, Nature, STAT, Atlantic, WSJ I‚Äôm sure equal number don‚Äôt want lose grandparents Except New Zealand Taiwan compared country world consequences political decisions virus. need hold politicians accountable collateral damages income decimated shutdowns point lost apartment living car ""big inconvenience"". ones? sane person would acknowledge harms isolation limiting facial expressions children. even quantitate something like this? exactly benefits? know lot old people dont want restrictions either also want see grandchildrens lives affect. exactly for? scientists? No, seriously, evidence going throw country stereotypes around? top mind several things could say australians. I‚Äôm scientist anyone else surprised quickly pandemic seems receding? sister boat, put degree work hold due autoimmune disease. gave old Xbox One she‚Äôs passing time playing games. She‚Äôs usually busy care much video games it‚Äôs sort nice share hobbies even it‚Äôs get pandemic. She‚Äôs track get second vaccine start school fall I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôve tried make best pretty shitty year least. Definitely possibility cases rise again. said think likely significant would catastrophe even rise lot.

We following going us. 

1. roughly 25-30% population already level natural immunity infection. 

2. vaccinated decent rate expectations rate increase significantly next 2-5 weeks. 

3. vaccinated many elderly people even cases rise, deaths/hospitalizations rise less. 

4. weather getting better 6-8 weeks now, nice country. flu coronaviruses circulation highly seasonal thus end March may able spread much all. wonder effectiveness AZ would gotten used Phizers methods. counting symptomatic cases. countries active campaigns high level government discredit vaccine. 

I cannot believe Germany France this, shaken understanding world quite lot frank. See ya Niiiiiiice nonsense. Firstly, I'm much remainer get, yet conduct EU disgraceful. Secondly, sort person wants vaccine fail saving lives? (or thinks UK remainers think that). Key word ‚Äúmay.‚Äù 

Also, word law set stone whatever. isn‚Äôt god anything sort; real capability predicting future like people think does. So, there‚Äôs need get worked it. know Israel unfortunately human rights violations, they're putting place countries might too. It‚Äôs ok we‚Äôll get back horse soon enough  They‚Äôre less effective vs South African variant. Oxford Pfizer working development. Oxford said Autumn effective v SA variant too, seen comment Pfizer assume similar timeline. 500,000 people needlessly die take cautious approach back normal Pfizer Oxford-AstraZeneca ... 85% 94% respectively

The AZ vaccine showing higher efficacy vs hospitalisation (at least one dose)? That's hard believe given respective trial results - maybe BnT/Pfizer vaccine gets boost second dose AZ does?  got hit anti vax pseudoscience decade two people reticent trust one.

Add normal JP bureaucracy mix slow rollout. seriously wonder would even now, pressure ready Olimpics. want know ‚Äî live makes authority Israeli/Palestinian affairs?? comment person‚Äôs comment? solving? Two words: 

*Not happening.* read credible publications listen people know they‚Äôre talking (i.e. scientists public health experts)  need suspend normal civilized existence 98 year olds squeeze couple extra months nursing home lives.

agreed, older people nursing homes know time earth limited coming end want spend last years locked separated family loved ones. work assisted-living facility year activities shut visitors allowed unless someone literally deathbed, residents depressed af. day goes work someone feel like they're prison, going crazy confined room year, lonely depressed miss real contact families social activities, and/or saying worth live like this. Combined data vaccines, lower expected result. get per vaccine data? Governments Europe many goals imagined. every politician every country.

The much maligned Brexit Britain 3-4 months ahead vaccinations already far supply secured absolute nightmare Europhile politicians lashing out. There‚Äôs little hard data it. benefits far outweigh drawbacks sane person would acknowledge this. think social distancing go masks. 

I agree, really even many hard social distancing rules country is. 

Most social distancing voluntary rather formal policy. 

Masks formally required many states, counties cities. 

There also idea politicians use masks say still something opening economy. 1/7 population vaccines first dose 21 days ago.

Also compare 7 days ago, compare month ago pretty much one protected number covid hospital admissions average 4000 average 1,500.

There factors play including stricter lockdown measures comment flawed. couldn‚Äôt find it? It‚Äôs pretty obvious proven endlessly can‚Äôt find that‚Äôs worrying Remember Germans French refuse AZ. I‚Äôd like get shot I‚Äôm asked yet age. plenty people ready get shot whether AZ Biontech/Pfizer.
I‚Äôd suggest everyone refuses AZ go right end line wait second chance. depends politicially popular time. 

This whole thing turned political issue, rather public health one. results great Pfizer AstraZeneca there's absolutely reason country wait least 10 weeks second shot vaccine Well junk science fed idea giving doses first recipients, letting search second. Thankfully dumped. Compare United States Brazil see high carnage well What‚Äôs consensus Osterholm‚Äôs claim 6-14 weeks catastrophe? Where's source? acknowledge thrse harms? point mostly agreeing I'm sure getting defensive agree, jackbox remote better nothing. fair, say first many pandemics don‚Äôt quit factory farming, little expected outcome say, aliens... Yeah, I...don't get enjoy it. effectively said yes, thanks that. Oxford already working SA variant. Said Autumn shots manufactured effective too. guess boosters everyone else. takes time vaccine actually gives protection. virus relatively long incubation time. get virus, takes time actually die. could also lag death reporting, know fast Israel comes reporting deaths.

Add together lot lag vaccine's effect visible statistics. mean vaccine work.

There may also risk compensation, i.e. less social distancing people get vaccinated. Fauci says masks may around üòû read fox news. look world around me.. suggest same. pandemic, absolutely do. additionally dealt earlier pandemics airborne therefore compliance higher. Maybe EU countries stop misinformation campaign AZ, doubt though damage probably already done cant reversed. makes think that? think 99% U.K. rooting AZ &amp; Oxford. End March what? rely scholarships require complete 4 years. It‚Äôs unlikely could even take gap Imagine caring one sport winning cup since 1993. Fucking Tampa Bay, Flordia üòÇ good communicator. get Trump admin stopped letting TV think doesn‚Äôt really matter. I‚Äôm happy lives saved even couldn‚Äôt go bar last year. Get big tacit difference ""this vaccine added common vaccines int'l travel, schools, HR packets jobs, etc., ""dude stops restaurant asks vaccine passport"". 2nd idea endgame concerning reinforced beyond pandemic. I've medical procedures done Canada think wait time thing overblown. insurance pretty good still pay would Canada. Regardless, healthcare guaranteed employment terrible system labor business owners. healthcare, necessity, universal citizenship, gives lot people agency get new job start business without fear losing healthcare.  debate covid facts non-science people, always stress articles respected science journals peer reviewed, data analyzed, there's degree validation confirm bias, intentional not. least story forthright peer reviewed, lots times casually omitted. Yeah seriously, people worried ""Unknown consequences"" COVID letting baby get exposed usual bugs us pretty untested well.

AZ probably least effective approved vaccines, still good. used acutely ""you need go restaurant"", analogous argument. Im fully aware decision made entailed, also started work long covid-19 even known about. said im allowed frustrated current situation. minimum though? COVID denier. evidence far outweighed harms? basing on?

You incredibly close-minded insensitive traumatized economically, mentally physically COVID response. six weeks fine according Pfizer, CDC says maximum interval. course would, Florida. 

Rational people power rare seems. seem many legal reasons allow common vaccination sit outs, e.g. ""religious and/or philosophical"" reasons. 

Do think 5 years people paid stop others outside movie theater ask vaccine passes? seems usage sub gone people conspiracy subs migrated know, I'm crying Alabamian right now. wrong. confirm virus.

With Covid-19 air sacks lungs fill mucus, clumps white blood cells chunks dead lung, causing patients slowly drown can't pump oxygen organs start shut down.

So inset tube lung attempt provide oxygen hope cause much damage - worry practice makes perfect. 

The good news stage likely conscious feel lungs inflate deflate, slowly time, lungs become fiberous stiff even artifical oxygen enough. One one organs shut pain kidney dying, lung, stomach.

Interesting sentiment. spread US lot concern Canadians. still lot cross-border travel people goods least province cases primarily imported. sooner get countries point border open sooner economy recover, many Canadians friends family south border care about. Getting back normal Canada requires US get back normal too. Reddit shits US mean Canadians care happens US justify attitude Americans caring neighbours allies either. Osterholm shows optimism. biggest pessimist showing optimism there's reason optimistic scheduled 18 days haha, I've thinking rescheduling I'm sure makes difference hopefully okay. Many Places Remain Closed, 'Whoever Get Vaccinated Left Behind' Well said. hope too. Florida never really shut gyms malls still less deaths California, shut since March 2020. Hell, live Colorado we‚Äôve open anywhere 25-50% capacity gyms, malls, restaurants cases weren‚Äôt bad lockdown states. Lockdowns don‚Äôt really work, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre  Well that‚Äôs lack federal support pressured people continue working, spread virus more. 


This isn‚Äôt victory us. catastrophic failure consider could‚Äôve saved 200,000 plus people done similar measures Canada. 


We means save hundreds thousands people decided to. fuck Israel zionisim. Yes. It‚Äôs exactly dismissing thousands deaths day completely unnecessary. I‚Äôm sure implied obese people comment. 70% Americans meet risk factors overweight obese policy addressed potential harm intelligent. 

Draconian lockdowns another non starter. sure don‚Äôt live Guangdong? stay home orders enforced penalty?  really denying collateral damage lockdowns? Honestly, last administration better. ""2 weeks flatten curve"" got people listen act. ""2 years flatten curve"" would gotten people throw arms riot immediately.

This even remotely questionable point. Yes, 1% risk dying actually pretty high, though risk dying COVID much lower people. think lot people 99% short hand ""very low odds"" even that's literally true 1 100. explanation pandemic‚Äôs early days, Dr. Fauci tended cite [60 70 percent [most did. month ago, began saying ‚Äú70, 75 percent‚Äù television interviews. last week, [interview CNBC said ‚Äú75, 80, 85 percent‚Äù ‚Äú75 80-plus percent.‚Äù  telephone interview next day, Dr. Fauci acknowledged slowly deliberately moving goal posts. so, said, partly based new science, partly gut feeling country finally ready hear really thinks.  may hear, said, believes may take close 90 percent immunity bring virus halt

90% threshold herd immunity would mean R0 10. There's way. seasonal huge wave last March misunderstanding EU works.

The EU democratic accountable. Whereas United Kingdom United States extremely undemocratic little accountability elected officials.

This makes taking punt future vaccine extremely difficult organisation like EU fundamentally rules based organisation.

On hand, autocratic nature UK US government lack accountability makes spending tens billions speculatively on, time, unproved untested vaccines relatively easy. sort botched Phase 2 trial messing timing doses patients, forced report efficacy rate 70s, compared Moderna / Pfizer 90s

The issues Phase 2 think reasonably gave people cause pause, awesome see vaccine effective states federal leaders yet come adequate plans address inequalities vaccine rollout, even saw similar disparities play COVID testing began nearly year ago white Americans disproportionately greater access tests, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director American Public Health Association, trade group based Washington, D.C. local site told last week fully enrolled pending approval crossover design. second visit last week another one next week. agree part comment all. sort proper segregation vulnerable would better wanted people still able live normally alongside virus. people dumb understand percentages didn't. said Times articles, article. seen accessible link. Slightly ironic, considering complaining inciting opinions clicks.

Yeah thats garbage statistic. 8 months ago 0 people vaccinated hospitalized. state, NJ, social distancing mandatory nonessential indoor businesses enforce governor revoke licenses/shut industry.

Outdoor social distancing pretty much voluntary point, fact large gatherings course aren‚Äôt allowed right now. Exactly Scotland needs independence. They‚Äôre rolling vaccine rest U.K. nothing.

In fact whole article deleted website. Take will. hit time peak january? holidays? real question could worn masks appropriately. Imagine half at-risk population vaccinated still cope worse restrictions less-vaccinated countries Europe. least they‚Äôll get vaccine injuries first Oh shut dude. Same, although can‚Äôt remember said know, peer reviewed studies available, given several draft studies reached conclusion, aligns perfectly expert expectations, I'd expect arrive soon. That's correct. mean imply United States' fault, pure domestic issue inside Canada. group people ideology mention Conservative Party Canada. government time domestic manufacturing capacity vaccines privatized eventually removed altogether. Sorry unclear! Three weeks ago said US could blow past 300k/day within what's 3-11 weeks, yeah either estimates seems bit...much. bartenders vaccinated people know work indoor dinining vaccinated. 

 Cuomo consistently increasing indoor dining availability thinks we're good long run. 

NY actually less cases per week back March spike. think within couple months (by early May), NYC could normality back long there's issues vaccine rollout. That's I'm predicting anyhow. really hate somehow become game ‚Äúmorals‚Äù. express restrictions hurting way point Fauci‚Äôs contradictions, anti-mask terrible person don‚Äôt believe science automatically certain political affiliation. It‚Äôs frustrating.

No, Linda, I‚Äôm anti-science, I‚Äôm also healthy 20-something sacrificed lot past year. Cut slack. people go freezing weather? No, don't. Places open takeout options, delivery options, limited occupancy more. Like gee whizz wonder roads frozen ***is actively making people less likely leave home.*** doubt anything SII included EU's supply chain. Lots positive news NYT state bars closed, clubs closed, businesses still capacity capped, street festivals allowed, concerts, too.

We still soft lockdown.  led Public Health Scotland found four weeks first dose, hospital admissions reduced 85% 94% Pfizer AstraZeneca jabs respectively. 

[Covid vaccines - 'spectacular' impact serious Exactly. It‚Äôs hard explain Christmas New Year gathering cases started drop. way going Labor Day too. new coronavirus strains impact too. Don‚Äôt that... don‚Äôt give hope tend optimistic side daily threads seems like you‚Äôre either one end spectrum other. truly feel end road (in US) see April/ May MUCH better, won‚Äôt perfect. take time, think life largely normal. Maybe won‚Äôt packed concert stadium, see gatherings trips commonplace then. Fingers crossed combo feels like post holiday surge drop, herd immunity seasonality working together keep cases good. J&amp;J vaccine I'd even think taking. hate needles, one dose best. trust MRNA vaccines yet. that's even get vaccinated. I'm risk. fairly clear full vaccination cycle complete, people safely return living normal-ish. genuinely believe mask messaging vaccinated individuals broadly keep masks social norm vaccine distributed critical mass people (likely summer).

I'm vaccinated. Happy wear mask couple months helps prevent virus surge among vaccinated. We're end stage pandemic U.S. There's reason anything derails that. No, shut deal risk, that's point.

Not year ago, recognize that, point Lockdowns need end immediately.

You assess risk, want stay home, it. care, job longer protect you. Silver eviscerating NBC NY, lol. question seeing terminal son dies, even you‚Äôll one shot then, would it. protected would shots? No. I‚Äôd tell without shot too. careful trip. risk lowered, it‚Äôs gone. immunity build definitely gradual. Sponsored ads.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Microbiologist here, also read data looked like parents going get it. already gotten mRNA vaccine would absolutely get AZ one. anti-AZ talk EU acting petulantly. Assuming vaccinating creates antibodies blood, cost good news see sub lately. seem forget cost. No, depend general population density countries vast proportion territory uninhabited forests artificially drop average population density. instead look places actually people live, find quite urbanized population density cities 80% population located pretty similar european countries.

I don‚Äôt time find source (can later), recent study indicating R0 twice high Sweden compared Norway back March 2020, restrictions implemented. would imply socialization habits aren‚Äôt similar two countries people make out. that‚Äôs *addition* Swedish healthcare far less centralized well-prepared. sure located, assume OP America since he's talking Costco.

The thing can't everywhere except California hold concert outdoors. using AZ Pfizer, mixing doses. get AZ first dose, second dose also AZ, example. extreme circumstances, like notes first dose vaccine mixing allowed. vaccine developer microbiologist.
Basic gist: vaccines create strong cell response, initial antibodies produced may work well variants, cells still sort (covid variants out), producing mild illness worst case.

No hospitalisations deaths. Well, glory holes safe apparently. Dude one locking they're vaccinated. Calm. Down. Oit, listen mate! taste thing! nat-rully took advantage situation. context discussion, one would reasonably assume comment receiving different COVID-19 vaccines. 

Because indeed data makes sense use data measles vaccines make conclusion COVID vaccines. preliminary research support this. counter this, people underpaying conditions know something like makes worse.

If simply immunize old send everyone else lockdown another wave overloading hospitals next younger risk population segment. Yes likely survive, even risk people pretty good chances survive hospital overloaded, overloaded doesn‚Äôt matter chances are, can‚Äôt get help need, likely die. 

These chances statistics, young person still die, old person survive. 

But real people don‚Äôt die reason people selfish want life go back was. 

It can‚Äôt go back was, never, world changed things live rest lives. That‚Äôs scare mongering, that‚Äôs realistic. nothing wrong world changing. Hopefully make changes better. 

I‚Äôd can‚Äôt accept world changes something different life people coexist literal definition selfishness. find worst thing happened pandemic finding many people selfish. Oit, listen mate! taste thing! nat-rully took advantage situation. know bottom four nations population density? :) Right would advised get two different covid vaccines. think would harmend, rather can't rule would adverse affects.

It‚Äôs clear day powers every intention making mask mandates lockdowns permanent.

Traveling EU country another EU country I'm guessing U.S. can't say I'm surprised...  you‚Äôre implying jobs won‚Äôt? Dude I‚Äôm saying trades bad, I‚Äôm saying everyone wants them. City limits arbitrary. annoys people use rather metro populations. point vaccinated enough people community transmission rates drop well R0 contact tracing plus quarantine becomes effective containment strategy. virus become endemic way longer possible, reduced rate infections resulting deaths matches levels existing socially acceptable loss flu. know SA variant, prevent variants UK, proving using AZ Scotland? mixing vaccines? cases dropping U.S. since mid January despite fact general population vaccinated yet. cases, hospital admissions. Health Canada approving AZ recommend single dosage mRNA? numbers fantastic. ridiculously slow roll vaccines due limited availability Pfizer Moderna. AZ can't handle new strain road, updated boosters available. one dose mRNA work, much doses available road. best get many vaccinated possible reduce deaths hospitalizations. That's goal. 

Yet health authorities recommend lockdowns ignore socioeconomic consequences prescribed actions, reason despite flood verifiable data vaccines, amendments made reduce deaths hospitalizations. Definitely 58 lol News general poor favour comes vaccines. expert says ""we wait evidence"" media report ""scientifics trust"" ""effectiveness question"". really hope Northerners seeing south go back normal gives state governments kick pants open everything up.

Furthermore, also demonstrates limited form household mixing going rampantly spread COVID mitigation measures place. I've never big fan UK's lockdown policy; keeping businesses schools open banning private social contact inefficient way manage COVID long-term period. obviously going EuroVision number advantages would nice have. probably 100% nessacary though. 

I think particularly terms vaccine hesitancy. 

1. people think traditionally vaccine thus likely get J&amp;J vaccine. 

2. one shot people truly hate needles might able convinced take one.

3. know many people distrustful J&amp;J also many people like compared drug companies may trust vaccine more. I'll take one offer first. Specially seems evidence great effectivity among UK elders, another Phase III trial conclude USA. maddening messaging handled. sum we're told right Fauci couple others seem leaders pack: Vaccination = masks another 18 months.  

Now, tend think that's even close true get words ""possible"" could wearing masks 2022, that's bad media saying variants ""could"" ""may"" ""might"" escape vaccines. really mean whole lot can't held it. 

We need start showing people way this. say that's day day restrictions gone. longer mandatory wear mask school grocery store restaurants 75%+ capacity.  rules little longer going ballgame airplane, fine. That's deal breaker (for me). year needs getting day day lives back next year getting back partying. Right messaging horrific makes sound like need strap lifestyle another 18+ months.  What's worse check vaccination numbers always notice Sundays way lower days. happened 24/7, hands deck, nothing urgent since WWII? almost nobody believed talk summer vaccines coming winter. got December ""oh, shit! meant *this* winter?""  window clean mess message continues life return actions show really urgent anyway, going fail. Life get back normal one way another. much guaranteed. Exact opposite. Europeans/self-hating Americans trying paint crap vaccine surveys say 40% certain European countries (*cough* Germany *cough*) get make sound like idiots. recommend delaying second shot mRNA vaccines. Projecting future. Looking expected full vaccination dates negative views based comments actions European Commission, please try tell I'm talking nothing EU everything member states. Like Germany second wave? People sympathy catch and/or die COVID days. people didn‚Äôt care anyone died car crashes flu 2019 years that. think 99% may exaggeration Covid virus: Goddamn, fucked lungs already...I'm outta here...

Go Asian country - that's simply true all. Again, sick leaving house, what's wrong protecing others 30 minutes? I'm US, asking learn. almost everything already open long time states (like Florida)? countries done testing per capita US Israel UK. vaccine make immunity robust. get news google Facebook. Lately seems everything fine peaceful that's actually case, close 70% vaccinated immune first week April. society adopt attitude phsycally ill public wear mask covid common cold

I've discussion - people seethe mere possibility it. Never seen many people proud selfish. cold go shops, wear mask. negatively hurt life, prevents spread germs. Good see mental toll finally getting acknowledgment would US keep restrictions, come high cost society, longer necessary? U.S. adult receive vaccine, keep wearing mask? Portugal isn‚Äôt fully vaccinated? FOH. wasn‚Äôt toxic all, it‚Äôs literally problem happens get infected Dengue: second infection alternate strain significantly worse. don‚Äôt want problem COVID, quit selling lottery tickets hoping won‚Äôt hit Powerball recombination event allows completely evade current antibodies. less chances infect people, less likely find key mutation. leaders churches tend mojo religious communities (think imams rabbis)... Black thing. reports EU AZ vaccine heavily politicized ultimately kill people delay taking vaccine wait ""right"" vaccine. 

My friend's parents skipped vaccine even though somewhat privileged priority group. awful. seen ""record number deaths"" articles since Biden took office Florida open, including schools. point know it‚Äôs done. accept thousands space don‚Äôt berate masks, it‚Äôs over. Fuck off. see couple idiots news assume anti science. fucking forget Nobel Prizes? Even excluding immigrants, number native born Americans beats everyone else. Separate politics people.

Thats question, meaningful chance people continue masks, etc, vax made available anyone wants it. misinformation herd immunity statement. factual. think adventurous states reopening mid-end March, think Florida/Texas/Alabama, etc. California least planning reopening around End March-End April. Guys obvious satire hey like USA forced shut vaccine making plant

That plant never used make mRNA vaccines there's zero reason believe Pfizer would walked set shop still open today. Pfizer &amp; co set plants wherever want, can't force build factory here. Yeah, given healthcare provider (who specializes children) parent, I‚Äôm inclined believe done (and continue do) far research you. 

I didn‚Äôt comment initially start fights disrespect anyone‚Äôs personal perspective. brought others different perspective. reason attack parenting, imply kids traumatized, assume I‚Äôm idiot. 

My personal experience virus traumatizing, though. son symptoms MIS-C, name recognized. two kids got days diarrhea weeks exhaustion. 

My otherwise healthy 56 year old BIL died Covid August less 2 weeks getting it. It‚Äôs touched personally professionally, I‚Äôm pretty sure hasn‚Äôt touched meaningful way, maybe perspective deserves much weight yours? Except didn‚Äôt that. did. 

Thanks trying dunk us tho. guys really shown true colours lately. bet grandma would rather risk getting virus locked room final years/months. Right? collectively going trauma. We‚Äôve living way life nearly year, understand difficult return pre pandemic socialization. People need time adjust. CDCs data might good start 
     
The CDC produce independently developed COVID-19 projections.  
       
Each week, CDC posts forecast new deaths total deaths US. ensemble forecast combines independently developed projections IHME [64 independent research institutions, universities, individual researchers presently located least 4 countries, including United States, United Kingdom, India, Switzerland. 
       
The ensemble forecast appearing CDC site week combines projections IHME 36 modeling groups. 
              
The ensemble forecasts appearing CDC web site week limited period covering next 4 weeks, unlike IHME projections, typically cover next 100 days. quarantine home actually politicians asshats. Locking make covid go away, makes everyone miserable depressed. little things never thought miss hurt most. Like, miss asking teachers questions person. girlfriend thing given hahaha, even seeing peoples' faces hurts.

The depressing reality distinct possibility we'll restrictions place mid-way sophomore year. That's almost HALF time college. addition ending portion senior year hs. Unbelievable.

And think youngest kids now! Starting kindergarten 1st grade Zoom, missing full year crucial social skills develop. would hate someone age right now; can't even understand what's going them. lockdown pushed away us. wealth gap grown three-fold. are, though‚Ä¶ üê∑ Educators operate abundance optimism. principal told students thing, even rebooked April prom last June. teachers knew wouldn‚Äôt happen either refused admit things wouldn‚Äôt improve clueless. New businesses, including restaurants, opening neighborhood weekly. ‚Äúapocalyptic NYC‚Äù shit hysterical. Sounds like higher number would've went waste number secured even used. Except there's science behind lockdowns working slow spread. think people caught permanent case agoraphobia Seeing lot young people AA NA circle relapsing, checking mental hospitals, dying.

I government response start ridiculed it. bunch cover-your-ass politics destroying future 2 entire generations. Edgy Yup, interest discussing you. I‚Äôm sure think really hard figure reopening Israel different reopening Australia went exponential increase significant decline cases January 12, corresponding least 20% decrease reproductive rate essentially overnight happened right around New Years. could due vaccination natural immunity, cause gradual changes. 

This right answer. Right now, places like Dakotas perhaps 50% cumulative case rate Pacific Northwest 10-15% case rate. 

The real herd immunity cases continue dwindle zero even restrictions gone people go lives wish. Maybe what's going seasonal taper like coronaviruses do, return areas high vaccination rates. US yet.

I'm hopeful future, early view exhibit herd immunity. One heavily locked masked countries planet. Put pipe smoke it. non pandemic times, ride train daily major city. Almost every day (well covid) would see Asian person wearing mask, likely feeling well. think would fine kind mask wearing became normalized US. 

As far covid masking though, think 2022 we'll see masks daily life. absolutely loathe videos anti-maskers laying essential workers grocery stores like they're inevitably 20-something screamed spit 40 year old middle pandemic. cannot begin imagine damage that's done mental health must put mask helping others. help hockey loving brothers sisters north help many get done. hey like USA forced shut vaccine making plant He's completely control dangerous society. I'm glad see waking fact. vaccinating healthcare workers teachers, lot us reasonably young people ready start spending money minute weather allows! What, get news? :P reminded moron took video licking deodorant Walmart start bullshit reason. Facts. ran track high school would last track meet got email district saying getting week since someone one elementary schools district COVID. cancelled meet early it, everyone team *so* happy spring break couple weeks away excited time school.

Who would‚Äôve known would never go back. last day seen highschool friends. Prom canceled shortly that. Senior award night lame pre-recorded video. Disneyland trip. Drive graduation okay far ideal. Everything fell apart fast thinking makes sad again. He's egomaniac needs center attention. shop owner street work wife killed impact business last summer. Saving lives simple anything everything stop virus. us saying wrong way handle entire time? everyone waking up? think anyone taking issue location, exclusive. limited residents two zip codes rather elderly residents county, since whole county lot elderly residents, area? sites open everyone eligible county, specific neighborhoods. gotta crimp right. Which, mean, proud of. wish socialized healthcare here. 

But you‚Äôre right, two us lot similar, better worse, many would make think. US better somethings, Canada others.  I've already given up. whole thing stupid. I'll wear businesses force nowhere else. Oh getting vaccinated! doubt current restrictions lifted even majority population get vaccine. Well probably Hawaii, would make sense cares?


And idea everyone Asia constantly masked hell BS. might wearing heavy smog areas someone really sick that‚Äôs it. demanding healthy people mask public time Spot on. I'll add one list. 

Pandemic. Wear masks social distance? Nah, Doordash Instacart implying small businesses completely wiped face planet. Say hello Amazonian, Walmartian dystopia asked for. Well baby I‚Äôm mostly asking already here, doesn‚Äôt cord anymore lol Maybe soffocated death, risk breathing CO2 restricting proper oxygen, could cause things pnemonia. Even warmer climates breathing restricted due moisture building up. similar position early 30s different high-risk condition, immunocompromised high risk complications. also really well, also ‚Äònormal‚Äô, never thought sick, also don‚Äôt leave flat. 

I‚Äôm think people USA call adjunct professor still working online, feel really fortunate even opportunity do, it‚Äôs so, bizarre looking students thinking: none know might die teach face face. It‚Äôs like living another person‚Äôs life. 

I also incredibly grateful people taking seriously less lose us. also, god, really, really sucks feeling drained stuck inside, also feeling afraid happen go out, think much mortality _whatever_ do. 

Wishing health hoping it‚Äôll safe us world soon. Starting (still 75-85% efficacy rate depending vaccination) Osterholm Frigg Off? weigh - WACCO Agreed. 

Seems pretty stylish hate Florida everything days though. 

I expect (likely baseless) investigations, threats, scrutiny next weeks/months. guy needs shut boca. year ago still saying wear masks. getting ridiculous. We'll masks forever, reason. Every time mask mandate issued, numbers already going down, actually went up. guys need vaccinate. matter time new variants burn population like West Australian wild fire. Lean government. You‚Äôve warned! Duane Reed closed me. walk one block CVS. Chaos! I‚Äôm malicious all, point? college costing online? actually said fuck loud reading that. That's obscene agree there's mental health issue stake. saying agree plan, wonder plan consistent see coming new admin terms things. 

Also, greetings WVU Alum Virginia Tech alum (from way back day)... attended great parties school football weekends! don‚Äôt see lockdowns Europe tbh. Restrictions maybe, vaccinations especially coming summer, don‚Äôt think people take kindly big lockdowns. Even governments try, remember Europeans didn‚Äôt really give crap last summer either. Extreme true. really think making vaccine altruism vs profit? frightened let restrictions soon, vaccinations everyone's arms, we'll one last wave. it'll doozy too, mask social distancing mandates dropped, schools facilities opened. \#thankstrump please ""reddit contrarian"" thing?

It's intellectually lazy. Fingers crossed there's never anything report simple one gets seriously sick post-vaccine.

Why would case? observe vaccinated people **any** vaccine **not** getting sick and/or going hospital and/or dying, win. would something report: Different statistical distributions non-vaccinated people vaccinated people. trend changes strongly big proportion population fully vaccinated End March IMO. Covid growth rate deep negative right now. We'll long tail COVID cases year, main risk gone end March, cases sub 1000 per day, maybe even sub 500 range. Ok about, 9-11 Canada took orphaned aircraft airports across US high alert. Canadians housed fed Americans days needed. town humanitarian crisis pay back goodwill? however totally unreasonable expect another country hit far worse provide vaccines cannot/chose produce own. even unreasonable get upset country choose hamper economic medical recovery many Canadians tread doing. offense think expected. Ecuador exactly leader quality life.

Canada trailing US quite embarrassment. Germany, Poland, Italy, rose week, too. 

Africa seeing many nations getting first big wave now, summers (with way healthier populations getting way vitamin D, etc, etc, etc). 

But know, keep downvoting, braintrust. Keep conversations Fauci knows he's talking like says, it. cringe posts I've seen reddit. Yeesh. Libertarian? think mean entitled. Heart issues don‚Äôt die either. foolish believe anything else would happen. country fails care citizens first really country. many citizens 16 though?  close 100 million. Dead meat don‚Äôt beat... also population 40 million people. can't go raw numbers we're bigger lot countries. Canada's whole population less 10% America, understand that, right? Fact call coronavirus hoax. referred Democrats‚Äô criticism administration ""hoax,"" coronavirus."" South africa here, politicians essential medical workers June. 500,000 people die. mean, wear eye goggles got Amazon needed ones went glasses...so you‚Äôre far 500,000 people die. brother 19 fully vaccinated works Kroger. Right, touch (surface) transmission really minimal threat compared aerosolized virus, glasses, much like goggles, would help protect against. Almost everything is, been, open Texas quite time. Thank you. Fuck Zionism. Finally orange dumb fuck gone. understand family's circumstances represent everyone else world?

My condolences family's hardship, everyone America first alternate choice. would personally rather live country neo-nazis political system remained embarrassingly stagnant putrid last 50 years. spent roughly 8% GDP year bill. That‚Äôs pretty massive percentage. Way way better 20‚Äôs didn‚Äôt miss social aspect college. education also lower value, job market wrecked, along whole summer internships opportunities improve resume. ‚ÄúThis new hoax‚Äù President Donald Trump February yeah, called hoax. Really? We‚Äôd save perhaps month two - vaccine production cure pandemic. wah missed things boohoo. Theres people going homeless every second. People can't pay bills. grateful happening still pampered real world. look back shit could go back I'd probably skip smoke dewbie. think mental health 55 year old lost job living tent without knowing they'll ever live normal life is? strawman, plan vaccinate citizens first, distribute accordingly. US part manufacturing component. Idk u guys/gals ever worked manufacturing, hardly something ignore write off. vaccine would happened without one part other. 16, mean (16+ currently Pfizer vaccine age requirement). bet we‚Äôll herd immunity time they‚Äôre able get vaccinated. agree binary made be,that normal needing masks less mutually exclusive. I'm also afraid masks restrictions going required long strictly necessary. One hardest parts last year trying reconcile liberal people respect generally learn become myopic view protecting society.

Sure, first weeks easy align on, especially hindsight... Lockdown well, support people (not monetary support either, given horrific systems -- consider mental health, activity, critical preventative care, etc) happen feels like lost context.

The way approached last year feels like political role revisal. We're strange world mention concern quality life longterm implications restrictions (not even avoid simply address do) fiercely rejected fellow liberals ""at least they're dead"". notion balance gone impossible protect people COVID address impacts so. 

Social media littered social shaming anyone almost anything isolation, even follows science rules progressive state in. rhetoric absolute utterly privileged people attack someone wanting work moments flood uber eats amazon orders. 

Most alarming cold shoulder communities usually focus most. I've watched homeless camps grow grow around California, small, local businesses far likely employee poorer workers shut doors. Even COVID approaches favor work home, decently well off, english speakers. Thi

There's much could help protect people covid there's much wrapped done last year take us decades unravel, likely more. There's nothing progressive that. great US... vulnerable folks there. I'm concerned US breaking vacccine records every country deals shortages. Canada Mexico barely able vaccinate 1.5 million people EACH.

There enough go around, hope gets better soon. still go see people, what‚Äôs hard everything like normal except wear mask? Honest question here. It‚Äôs lot harder stay home social distance wear one people freaking masks may necessary another year? heard radio today. 498,000 2 pm. quick..... graduated high school 2009 depression studied dropped PhD pandemic.

My parents wonder kids house less month's rent savings working software dev wife PhD scholarship... got mine wasn‚Äôt even eligible category. didn‚Äôt lie cheat buy way in‚Äî someone didn‚Äôt show appointment dose wasted. administered 6 hours vial opened. 10 doses vial 10th person didn‚Äôt show up. friend runs clinic happened called said could could half hour. hauled ass there. Got second dose last week. 

There horrible weather like 3/4 country last week know vaccination clinics closed week parts southeast iced over, may big lull numbers next updates come out. Australia here. old lady prime minister got today. all.  get nothing died U.S. vaccine... Also exact thing decided stay community college bit longer glad made choice sorry happened fellow human call med student graduates last theire class? Doctor. 

It's worst vaccine likely approved, that's it. likely approved good enough. help. see it. want give could done better. Since it‚Äôs going 100%perfect want throw parts working. would person you‚Äôre telling OP cut it‚Äôs heartbreaking read tbh. Friends suppose understanding seems like OP isn‚Äôt even trying understand friends preemptively upset won‚Äôt change 3+ months now, setting failure event change. sound it, OP also making whole lot assumptions hasn‚Äôt even talked friends this. OPs friends mean anything them, try understand point view. friends didn‚Äôt patience am, alone, sad, trying hard make work keep friendship going without things put risk. tell CA exact long term damage referring to. 3 masks... save post link says ""**save**"" right post. also encourage use remindmebot revisit converation future.

California 40 million people 3.5 million confirmed cases.  believe cases fall absence official unofficial limits? think Covid-19 seasonal, take lid cases blow up.

My expectation California's cases fall people continue wear masks, limit interactions, government acts business limit interactions. opposite happens opposite occurs.

I'm sure certain areas far, far 50%.  That's awesome even awesome midsummer, question drives current downturn cases, hypotheticals future. pessimist, agree. Really sorry death young BIL COVID. cousins Canada consistently complain dirty hospitals extremely long wait lists routine care surgery. never good things say it. reason always become confused hear people talk great Canadian healthcare system is. fly in, spend first 3 days designated Hotel. I'm starting Quarantine Australia, facing return Canada.  I've lived SF, LA OC, friends areas name one even go hospital.  last 3-4 months, COVID probably spent indoor gatherings, people follow masking rules. minute started getting *chilly* night (like 50-55 degrees) people moved small gatherings indoors. lockdown fatigue, seemed natural people wanted socialize would private settings, many gatherings held indoors.

This particularly problematic communities many essential workers might've picked work, go intergenerational homes meet friends/family. Latinos hit hardest California, afaik essential worker proportion + intergenerational housing two explanations cases much higher Latino community. Nobody answer question find hundreds people elsewhere exact opinion.

The press they'll talk rich countries see inferior people per capita vaccinated that's embarrassing done... more.

People remotely interested reasons things. maddening, simply care. respect other's choices.

Yes would probably cut off. see mistake point point subjecting stress hoping change may come. Fuck man I'm gonna wear mask till 2072 brb, gonna buy DeWalt stonks That‚Äôs super sad. even vaccinated she‚Äôs going cut everyone prevent anyone coming over? wonder countries' stimulus looks like relative GDP though. U.S. wealthy, also large country. Nope. I‚Äôm ditching mask soon vaccines widely available. Fauci suck egg. Seeing US sell Covid-19 vaccines Canada. Canada 2.5% vaccinated, run vaccine, seeing dramatic drop. announced deal build manufacturing facility? entire last year knew would needed. understand trying failing facility running time, far tell, even started. bad, many people die need #1 cases internationally Hahahahahaha talking above, time exposure person test 10 days, two, practically three days since tested. That‚Äôs $400,000 USD. What's favorite fidget? really like [this got really satisfying weight motion it. think correct school isn‚Äôt even planning person classes fall assume still lockdown :( Conveniently plan one disaster time. great opportunity prepare several likely things. economic cost one pandemic easily eclipses reasonable preparation could (and should) done. like saying let‚Äôs never public health campaigns lessen spread diseases inform targets often adults lol Major caveat: number doesn‚Äôt include Palestinians Israeli Arabs. count those, make almost half population Israel, closer 30% trisomy 21 cancels baldness thing lives Drury lane Religious leaders always lot power flock. someone else explained religion became highly influential black communities due slavery (slave masters using Christianity control mechanism), religion often generational, religion often used cope trials tribulations. that‚Äôs Christianity present lot black communities. Must nice privileged. con governments saw privatization renowned vaccine company ultimately sold sanofi. Death absolutely normal, sure you‚Äôre getting Human beings never going stop ‚Äúgathering groups‚Äù. virus anyway. work education. state live prioritizes teachers educational sector. dad w me, hed qualify chronic condition occupation he‚Äôs vaccinated too. Ah, you‚Äôre really close ‚ÄúFrench Canadian‚Äù aspect ‚ÄúFrench Canadian Dude,‚Äù instead man, it‚Äôs iconic C√©line Dion. Yes easter 2020 Canada ordered 6 million doses mRNA vaccines (4 mil Pfizer 2 mil Moderna) delivered March 31st. Canada received 1.85 million vaccines production ramps up. fair? Look - keep missing point. reason send Canada vaccines US death rate higher Canadian death rate (deaths per 100,000). get Canadian rate, might make sense think - think Canada would sourced vaccine supply. Canada purchased vaccines per citizen almost country planet, timing bit delayed. 

The US rate needs drop 5x match Canadian deaths per 100000 - certainly lives would saved sent extra vaccines neighbors south (Mexico) horrific uncontrolled outbreak. right now. RIGHT NOW, GO CARES Act largest stimulus package US history, cost almost $2 trillion. That's... quite bit different spending $2 billion vaccines. It‚Äôs $700-$1400 now, bad better Biden can't force people wear masks get vaccines, make political? Fauci saying Biden elected. I‚Äôm sure. don‚Äôt make rules. I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôve shots almost 6 months issues trend putting covid response war terrorism contexts cringey. part ""highly contagious"" people understand? started couple dozen cases, look got us. tempt fate vaccines rapidly tow. probably use different population estimate? check get vaccinated where? I‚Äôm 21 healthy I‚Äôm sure ima waiting abit time. Would find clinic them? grand parents great grandparents Mexico. told would Easter? Masks really big deal. US people think people babies expect come summertime? Assuming almost adults vaccinated then, babies (obviously) aren‚Äôt, parents still exercise caution? bring baby around vaccinated people? ""We never never call IT, downsize."" Mark words, pattern repeats itself. Didn‚Äôt ask top. Answer question without deflecting insane 25 40 year olds care old people risk, apparently for. costs lockdown greater covid include Palestinians? Protection vulnerable #1 priority outset. 

It's obvious, imo, money protecting subset population, one did. 

If took billions allocated toward virus mitigation methods used specifically towards protection vulnerable, believe talking virus way today.

But hindsight twenty twenty. Don‚Äôt worry everyone, start bouncing back soon get affordable access healthcare housing. same. frustrating older people say ""it's year two life!"" ""It's hard stay home!"" 

A year might make much difference adult working job decades, high school / college students, missing year significant. People literally telling math all, you‚Äôre still replying dumb comments... clearly idea hole Trump dug taking ‚Äúlet‚Äôer rip‚Äù strategy almost full year. virus eradicated UK then? expect deaths hospitalizations it?  saying Healthcare workers? Id love see it! can't imagine personality far ""act"" though. (not negative comment political hate either side). masks cure-all dude Lamo better go job store pick new work home job greatest economic crisis century. we're people work factories trades surely work home, right? üëè use flu model authorization. Trials next months production switched summer it‚Äôs needed fall booster. Damn dude, happy something.... Yeah sure! I've trying tell others know trust missing much comes schooling. might feel like super important right one biggest parts life line vastly insignificant eventually doing. Take time develop interests/hobbies extra time given think important focus on.   Yeah, people like talk much shit US lot actually thought one best places get vaccine. I'm actually worried Fauci saying mask-wearing remain place 2022. He's health official, single-handedly dictate policy. (Gelatin encasement, anyone?) 

Should listen say? Probably. agree everything say? No.

People *right now* already beginning ditch masks; *governments* right already ditching mask mandates. Fauci says wants pipe dream.

However, I'm concerned uptight state governments release mask mandates. mean feel like we've 500k ages. oo interesting comment. explain cell escape immunity antibody escape immunity is? Also coronavirus able mutate antibody escape immunity cell? thanks government paying shots individuals insurance companies instead? Big pharma would charging 20k per injection could give priority based need. would rich getting shots. you‚Äôre comfortable taking psychedelics like LSD/psilocybin , there‚Äôs anecdotal evidence smell taste returns whilst tripping / comes goes afterwards. Idk, something look into! That's reddit you.

Anything portriat negative conspiracy China seemed ""legit"" even without proper backing evidences

Anything remotely suggesting China something useful helpful facing spammed ""Chinabot""/""CCP lies"" even providing concrete evidences Yeah you‚Äôre strawmanning

It‚Äôs real discussion

Everyone thing sub it‚Äôs clear changed abruptly. We‚Äôre easy manipulate Selfish tired unoriginal criticism motivator right now. 

*You* *want* wear face covering Giant supermarket *you might* get hypothetically ill going store around time me? 

It seems also somewhat selfish. premise wrong. choosing get vaccinated endangering unvaccinated people ability achieve [herd particularly thinking people can't get vaccinations (vs people choose get vaccine).

It'll also likely delay ability crush virus return life normal outbreaks continue happen, it'll continue find hosts mutate [more people good clip life returning normal [until herd Antivaxxers, antimaskers, covid deniers fuck they're everything extend pandemic. deniers, part, 50.

In case, severe. numbers there. look like. Honestly rank Trump treated worst, Canada top. That's say Trump great Canada, we're donating vaccines countries based Trump treated sending Mexico? Agenda? people don‚Äôt like something it‚Äôs agenda. living seeing eyes. Wake fuck people. Deblasio crippled NYC, people see shell become. LA same. Unfortunately years mess ahead us thanks pussies don‚Äôt balls move on. 500000 dead pretty bad though. want protect vulnerable first foremost. Hospital workers stretched thin. deserve break fuck say get Covid fine age? know health condition. 

I sick tired people like think people like invincible.

It's also people like pushing people like away left-wing politics wants coddle countries ahead own. shit 500 alex Yeah good trend highlighted lot currently is. 

I think point substantial portion COVID cases Florida travelers tested positive elsewhere vacation ended valid point addressed enough, 100% case Super Bowl celebrations given Tampa local team Tampa really national-fanbase people would travel Tampa game watch either stadium city.  point media cheer set easy goal beat it. like cheering #1 seed defeats #16 seed NCAA tournament. US hit all-time high daily cases exactly 2 weeks Christmas. Yeah. *wish* things could better, actually expecting full-on 2019 normalcy return spring summer year going set us failure. midwest/rust belt many factories closed down, people who've working jobs decade work. Many people become victims growing opioid crisis sweeps communities. children born communities stuck broken homes without real means escape.

Similar cases, yes, except one drug crisis labeled 'war' politicians leveraged advantage, resulting bunch money wasted large demographic people getting fucked disproportionately (Which contributes added skepticism towards government's decisions). 

Both communities getting fucked government suits exploiting panic, consider historic racial implications result specific groups people getting hurt moreso severely.  


My main takeaway little change topic consider pattern media gaslighting, politicians ""toughening up"", decisions would otherwise leave specific groups people screwed others long run. everything ""one one"" seems. Missing college time sucks, people young children ones feel worst for. Life college fun too, hopefully school stuff back normal soon Completely agree Kinda hilarious term ""Karen"" used characterize opponents sides lockdown argument. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

That's it. fighting policy isn't. country crumble. ever (?) need field hospitals.

No one right mind would call situation controlled even well managed.

But snow storm Texas seems like may worse, again, outside looking in. biggest sign restriction changes fact Cuomo allowed indoor dining city again.

As another surge, I‚Äôm doubtful, I‚Äôm 14 take advice grain salt. WTF blathering about? express desire required wear masks anymore came talking like can't understand someone want wear them. Yeah I'll admit response asking happy wear one te may bit sarcastic,but breathing produce same? 

And bullying broke millennials bit disconnected reality know start. explanation think current healthy amount THC alcohol consumption part. 

I'm trying sell anyone anything,I'm expressing desire required wear mask forever concern ways seems like officials headed way. Yeah I'm totally fine people need vaccine getting first. think people travel get vaccine give less fuck prioritizing people one country another. fuck even worried getting vaccinated young comorbidities. live minimally healthy lifestyle fine. One reasons Australia well already pandemic plan supported nation medical stockpile. improvisation panic initial response following plan. recommendation federal Chief Medical Officer Prime Minister border closed made golf course. Australia one western countries maintained ability make vaccines done 100 years.

If happens 20 years countries response wont better time. They're going forget like last time. This. True. many learned lot. good outweigh bad. I‚Äôm much aware easy get sick poor habits regards health. Silver lining friends. Lmfaoooo fr would nice problem get perspective we‚Äôve experienced high school, college, stuff. Someone never got experiences never get perspective, may left wondering ‚Äúwhat if.‚Äù

I agree you‚Äîespecially regarding high school. also remember important everything high school time. it‚Äôs laughable, important. it‚Äôs laughable got experience continued experiencing new things after. People miss that? may affect final perspective that. Unfortunately, probably right US.

Additional lockdowns probably going happen sure Europe Africa. JFC war human made disaster groups people battle land, resources, ideology, etc. pandemic consequence pathogen spilling new host outside treatment vaccines humans little control I‚Äôm Maryland too. I‚Äôm till 1C either. I‚Äôm Johnson Johnson trial may gotten vaccine placebo won‚Äôt know actually schedule appointment facility unblind me. need Maryland get 1C. spending 200 BILLION new buildings tripling number educators every child small classroom like private fancy schools. explains body hair Dude, weird. Russian's capitol, Moscow, literally set camps like 12 major malls vaccinate everyone. Dad's friend Lithuania working Moscow - went got vaccinated together. foreigner, OMS, universal healthcare insurance, still free. yet countries get like couple thousand vaccines. 

At least, far know, Russia already testing Sputnik Saudi Arabia, South Korea bought license vaccinate SK NK citizens share rest Asia. 

I know lot people Reddit wary Sputnik, actually work, ever since everyone care got vaccinated, I've become less anxious, even notice stressed fucking much year. sure hope so. Thing mother fairly reasonable stance everything else, it‚Äôs weird. acting like exact place year ago Oh 1000% bring media Nothing difference profit motives. anything US government spending lots imposing export restrictions private companies provide free vaccines millions Americans. Sounds like pinch like socialized medicine. Wonder anything fact masks fog glasses. world vaccinating years Nope lot others based study I've read seems like put vaccination center lot old people. Florida retirement state, makes sense there'd wealth old people. obviously think vaccinations many places possible accessible everyone, really think there's malice here. Call pharmacies 4pm super nice see extra doses ask okay call another time. Nah mean, growing got shots. vaccines slightest. went Vietnam two years ago urged get travel vaccines. COVID one got weird be9she can't discern truth fiction Facebook wondering plan phase threes, since lot approved vaccines That‚Äôs ridiculous. Anyone emerg vaccinated. I‚Äôm floor gen surg (mostly bowel surgeries) kinda (?) understand coworkers deemed priority, freaking EMERG vaccinated? Shameful. 

Canada failing HCWs. Good luck finding anyone replace staff burned process burning out. Oh see now. There‚Äôs hope. Go live mess created. Bye They're listed paper believe 23AndMe sequence them. Yep. group included study.

We still done large scale research US covid side effects. one hardest parts financial burden 18-24 year olds. feels bad treated frontline fodder, catch covid make minimum wage. meanwhile established folks comfortably work home preach importance stopping spread. sucks--i supposed graduating college starting life. set back financially mentally. that's J&amp;J, expect know that. Ok...well got two cents in. Sure showed Wait, Fauci this?! Yes trump vaccine really helping. Sure, look food delivery industry grocery store workers. don‚Äôt know destruction mean. countries like AUS Canada helped citizens. you‚Äôre mad Trump admin denied virus saved shareholders stocks instead citizens take deaths preventable. Stop dummy. 65, likelihood counties California age 55 16-55 preexisting condition open March 15th.

Median FPR 2.3%, 4.0% cases. trump vaccine taking effect...so well soon. US. locked nothing cause people misery many ways pathetically weak virus Show indisputable science unanimous amongst science community. get upset bombs exploding, death normal! think may one missing point. seem arguing straw man. continually argued point advocating sending vaccine now. repeatedly refuted point. I‚Äôm sure makes clear. infection rate continues drop US 5x drop take much longer (as time vaccinating 1c). Additionally infection rate become less significant corresponding death rate drops spread limited younger, healthier segment population.  Raw infection rate within US stop leading indicator future death tolls. Also, argument Canada sourcing vaccine ‚Äúthen‚Äù reveals lack knowledge. US interfering deals made Pfizer Moderna Canada disrupting ‚Äúsourcing‚Äù ability. drug companies suppose already provide vaccine Canada, US prevented it. Canadians sourcing much possible Belgium rest EU, inadequate remain indefinite future.  Mexico, agree assist them. Sending Pfizer vaccines Mexico would problematic given logistics hurtle Mexico would face, J&amp;J vaccine would work. Since Pfizer announced doubling output next weeks, perhaps US divert significant portion J&amp;J Mexico government ready distribute it. There's way much immunity population another large last wave. would rather avoid small one, though. decline mental health may also caused deadly pandemic four thousand people day die without end sight. deluded thinking death inevitable. deaths preventable, transmissible disease known vaccine would prime example. follow estimated transmission rates United States, actually pretty smooth.  could see coming December, rate change transmission rate turned negative pushed toward one eventually it. 


It feel way people associate ""lots cases"" ""really big transmission rate"" really small transmission rate allowed stay 1 long, long time. 


This page good chart showing ebb flow R(t) US:  Wow true liberal nice. Doesn‚Äôt change science best method people complying measures prolonged increased suffering. credible source showing essential worker pay increased? balance economic destruction rest middle lower class?  policies damage go away he's president. He's directly responsible masks becoming politicized issue, spreading misinformation, actively discounting Dr. Fauci multiple occasions, sewing public distrust scientific findings. number deaths would vastly lower proper policies leadership place. hard get much lower given false positive rate PCR tests insistence mass testing healthy people. Adopting sensible diagnostic guidelines clinical examinations would decrease further. mean, I'm optimistic lot people subreddit, stretching pretty far, IMO.

It's *completely* outside realm possibility, personally bet it. fact scenario tiny realm possibility all, evidence far we've come short amount time. told December would've thought trolling hardcore. I‚Äôm miserable. I‚Äôm responding post miserable. Part adult realizing consider people‚Äôs lives too. ... ""glasses means smart, smart means learned COVID avoid early, therefore smart glasses-wearers avoided better"" similar, ey?

(that first-blush assumption. wear glasses &amp; avoided COVID, ya got me, bias acknowledged) proposing entire world locked acting optimal manner two weeks.

That's impossible. refusing produce it? easy money them? know. What's point? Add skyrocketing houses rent mix. I‚Äôm tired told people WFH jobs full college experience live stay home they‚Äôre incredibly privileged that‚Äôs job support system. Many essential workers saw increases pay you‚Äôre wrong. Also, would make sense prioritize risk vaccine. Nope, aware biden blunder. many get hard keep all. Ah yes island global hub commerce completely eradicated covid. wonder that. It‚Äôs another year them, albeit little difference.

Tell fellow countrymen same. üëç like talk rather much effective Canada handling things USA didn‚Äôt. dumb. Anyone refused take vaccine develops Covid-19 treated home. declined treatment would keep ICU, get desperately ill seek admission.  
I know stricture never put place could followed anyway. Physicians going refuse hospital care someone desperately ill. 
Perhaps better method would specify subsequent hospital care vaccine refusal must paid pockets. freebies refusniks. bigger man/woman here's saying... someone infected sneezes surface come along lick surface get covid.... Food, metal, carboard... That's infects. room sneeze wearing masks get infected breathing droplets. Japan approved vaccine February 17th... seems pretty slow.  anti vaxx republican.

I true liberal, pro lockdown neo libs. think forgot /s end there. I‚Äôve afforded luxury mostly working home last 2+ months due chronic kidney disease. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôm going ask released go back work regular schedule week. feel safe now. I‚Äôll keep wearing mask socially distance though, staying mostly house still longer makes sense. It‚Äôs almost year, time get back it. thing find vague references six figures US:  economy wasn‚Äôt shut down. lack actual ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù still significant number cases deaths.

That said.. non smoker, non obese, relatively healthy Canadian age 40 feel like im basically last line..which okay, long mean year waiting. Till Palestinians able get vaccine, Israel opening back need vaccinate Palestinians work Israel 100k people. currently Palestinian government pressuring Israeli's provide vaccination Palestinians  vaccinated way 85 years old, ran bad management part government Flu deaths disappeared social distancing measures taken place. goes show much deadly/transmissable COVID Fair point Provide credible source (not antivaxx website) stating wealth gap tripled. result could easily come fact Trump admin refused provide relief Americans instead spent money buybacks? maybe discouraging masks, downplaying virus prolonged pandemic first place? add refuse get vaccinated ineligible public benefits well. COVID got Tampa, saw Buccaneer D-line making mincemeat Mahomes decided, ""Nah."" /s I'm saying system fair, go life taking *everything* personally, thinking everyone everything you, thought process poisonous healthy. wheel shit hits everyone life. Nope human delaying gratification... pssshhh impossible. ./s

People don‚Äôt care others DIRECTLY happens them. Trump exacerbated even contradicting masking ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù voter base ‚Äúfight back‚Äù mandated lock-downs account ‚Äúmuh freedoms.‚Äù 


SARS-COV-2 tale travesty need result many dead (500k+) consequence inept leadership early pandemic.  shame work SA variant moment. Meaning people need booster shots. Yes includes Palestinians/Arabs citizens Israel, 20% Israeli population Yeah whatever bud.  It‚Äôs return normalcy spike here: crowded local trains started year, people flouting mask restrictions (twice I‚Äôve annoyed people keeping mine company), restaurants public spaces packed. 
The fear virus keeping people following restrictions, year fear gone. general perception is: won‚Äôt kill you, poverty will. 
And since visible effect people country loss income business, people really want get back normal. 17 days pushing bit. It‚Äôs shorter minimum tested pushing get low possible first place.  (There‚Äôs fair bit data saying vaccines work better longer gap.) I‚Äôd reschedule me. contest? true statement usually read Bloomberg News really interesting piece Abbott went develop Covid tests. someone background biotech, thought gave lot good insight one biggest players industry. Link article: possible could wearing masks 2032. could possibly mutant strain defies immunity prior infection vaccination that's extremely communicable extremely deadly; time get handle strain, new one emerges that's worse that.

Possible, extremely unlikely. We're close 1/3 way immunizing vulnerable populations many countries, likely covered near 100% groups June. hospitalizations becoming rare point groups capable weathering infection own, likelihood see normalcy, without masks, Memorial Day. Canada ability produce vaccine, vaccine comes outside (you thank previous mps). fortunate even getting any, MANY countries even started yet. Australia started vaccine rollout. This. Pfizer bought fully operational modern plant Marburg, Germany September Novartis retool COVID vaccine production... won‚Äôt produce vaccine April. Yet people think Canada could magically open new plant months? It‚Äôs absurd. legit know wanted alive 22 20s college basically sucked cock too.

So thank making people social martyrs perfect year. call bitter like sympathy whiny millenial/gen z bullshit really pathetic.

The pandemic caused stop alcoholic cokehead lot money. also travel go campus derived zero pleasure attending all, much going great college is.

It's shame pandemic.  doctor told infected Arabs lived Israel vaccinated everyone else. Palestinians Gaza West Bank isn‚Äôt them? buy vaccines get vaccinated, different Syria, Egypt, Jordan Lebanon? Palestinians workers work Israel probably get vaccinated next month Moderna vaccine. know extra Pfizer deliveries coming US factories outside USA?  Drops day (Jan 9) US. Congrats! Variants way keep media life support story. Ignore It‚Äôs good they‚Äôre exceeding beyond expectations, still believe change government one reasons feel like people glasses would touch eyes though. least aren‚Äôt directly putting finger eyes like us contact wearers though Half population montana. forgetting second dose really need work education system country. tenfold population. silly comparison  fair freshman year pretty ass you‚Äôll get another spring break, everything else though immunity last forever Well, still case reports.

There many covid cases someone somewhere clearly gotten virus via surface, doctor scientist would gotten interested rare situation documented it.

I think heard slightest word. start by, it‚Äôs possible, electing people care young people old main voting base. Gonna play little violin ya poor little martyrs who've suffered much. nta New Zealand got large number people coming tourists, relative population. quarantine incoming tourists stopped, definitely see vaccination requirement arriving. Unvaccinated tourists could difference herd immunity herd immunity. Also government shown aiming minimal deaths. Unvaccinated tourists would definitely unpopular locals brought covid-19 caused outbreaks. Oh didn‚Äôt know Myanmar center civilization. Maybe copy govt. Quick question, one copying? democratically elected one military coup? Perhaps stop projecting seething. Try think people within Tanzania want get vaccinated believe pandemic able get resources government believes otherwise. 

Being tasteless wave anymore. Hey, plus economy screwed young adults ones pay price. people trying protect pensions, retirement, paid homes financial security. Plus won‚Äôt around deal political consequences.

We selfish wanting little joy life, asking exact people care things important us, like know, climate change environmental distraction much ask. Yeah, decided since like three thousand cases total real rush live Florida seem like part another country; anywhere US. SMH. mother 80 y/ got gher first dose yet. EFFIN OUTRAGEOUS!  basically fun life time hit 30? That's saying? ‚Äúthe corona cult world view‚Äù would invested new idea wearing glasses might reduce chances getting covid?  Younger millenials gen z sacrificed virtually nothing, bitching moaning every step way.

I really sympathy people who're traumatized covid meant campus person. Boo hoo, deal it.
 
Your overhyping college experience really shmaltzy too.  finally step say I'm proud country. banned r/coronavirus three days incivility claiming 'labelling Black Lives Matter incivility'. made mention BLM movement specifically. say:

""Canadians displaying incredibly entitled attitude, especially cruel behavior 2020. addition sense entitlement, many white Canadians flaunting white privilege""

Incivility acceptable circumstances. can't play race card one direction make sweeping statements entire nation another. next time ban permanent.  fuck? positive post US front page!? Palestinians live Israel. site tracks vaccine doses per producer? Doses shipped, expected shipped 2021. UK, we've vaccinated 25% (adult) population

Covid cases going there's mood optimism future going do? Forcibly vaccinate them? re-elected government middle pandemic thing Covid platform.

People allowed mistakes. close boarders see sense turn giant lab experiment.

I form lockdown 11 month, going sympathy people deny basic truths. makes think vaccines covered countermeasures Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) really simple. also watched SNL last night. one thousand Americans dead, understand many people still give zero shit situation completely failed citizens. know Western Europe America center civilization right? another million people need die wake cognitive dissonance?  It‚Äôs 15, soon zero. last time posted leading theory glasses wearers use masks better seal prevent fogging up. There‚Äôs obvious mechanism effect. 

And thing, people would‚Äôve mentioned asked side effects. (That‚Äôs got Viagra erectile dysfunction med ... actually testing hypertension/chest pain.  erections reported side effect.)

If wasn‚Äôt idle curiosity (or gf‚Äôs) period late, go get pregnancy test.  kid seen inside school year now. Forgive think boo-hooing kids *maybe* wear masks fall childish bullshit. Give break. idea ECSTATIC kid going go back school see friends? think depend spirits wear mask? God, get perspective. I'd bet next paycheck even changed lifestyle much. did, see happening progress movement right direction, continual suffering family. Stacks stacks stacks  alone! thing going mind. FWIW, women healthy babies far 30's, even 40's albeit help. definitely sucks got time! Apparently could avoid 99 per cent COVID deaths get everyone 50 plus vaccinated. everyone wants that, want requires least masters degree. saying trades aren‚Äôt great anyone wants pursue that. edited post. don‚Äôt totally disagree opinion, it‚Äôs bit wanting cake eating too. US happy import massive quantities crude oil process, don‚Äôt cut supply every time there‚Äôs natural disaster impacting fossil fuel industry. ‚Äúthose people‚Äù ‚Äúyour country‚Äù ? True, well maybe Social Security benefit like roughly $278.00 USD, family lucky. overwhelming sadness everyone needlessly got sick died due covid spread careless young people wanted put living best life actually caring public health. people may become infected touching contaminated surfaces, touching eyes, noses mouths without cleaned hands first.

So get infected touching contaminated surfaces touching mouths contaminated hands. saying can't get infected licking contaminated surfaces directly? Well, first all, think majority people go around licking faucets, doorknobs, tables, packaging, etc. can't see makes sense begin with. mouth care whether virus enters touching contaminated faucet hand using hand touch mouth, versus licking faucet directly? fact, seems licking would direct means transmission.

I understand saying supposed make sense. Israel fucking owned they. Nice Yeah, it‚Äôs stupid. see Geiger counters sold.

Unfortunately Germans incredibly risk averse. It‚Äôs insured people world. insurance freaking everything. Hmm...seems...like....we...have...a...grammer...nazi...on...our...hands...here... I'm boat you. I'm 24 last year moved away home. three months normal COVID hit. 

Nothing's felt normal since, fuck ton anxiety whole lot thinking. plan set plan destroyed. 

I went home week first time four months amazing. broke rules I'm also feeling like ashamed. time get see people outside work. 

Fingers crossed shit ends soon. wanna grieve, I‚Äôm gonna grieve. Judging comment history, you‚Äôre obviously bitter sad childhood/late 20s. Get therapy help get &lt;3  They're prob going fact healthcare workers require face shields/visors management stickler policy followed. wouldnt say though wearing glasses make significantly better protection help. IMO aside masks, hand hygiene prob number 1.

I'm willing bet transmissions (if significant # cases exist) eye mostly bad hand hygiene touching eyes. name's ""Canute"" ? Sounds lot like ordering tide come in. easy keeping numbers fire person keeping track terrorize cops break home point guns children. 

Hell success story. absolutely. completely, purposefully fucked over. lucky even get consolatory $600 CARES act school--just slap face really, considering rent, food, general cost living. Doesn‚Äôt matter, he‚Äôs going get upvoted misinformation lmao. others speak of? majority vaccines going existing facilities, seen upgrades added loads.  feel ya. seen single member family year, mom lives country open borders 70 percent world vaccinated. Thing though always make expressions real people usually tell feel You‚Äôre dude another post claiming long covid ‚Äúabout 45 symptoms‚Äù declined specify told people Google it. 

Pardon don‚Äôt trust you. OH GAWD. 2 weeks, Florida handling exponential growth cases horrible super-spreader event? lot people actually changed behavior (though perhaps small amount).

I attest that. summer careful perfect. outdoor bonfire like 4 friends maskless fall went restaurant dad couple time. keep mind public perception back then; real clue would end. good amount months seemed like life going be. vaccines news every hour day. 

Once vaccines got attention, specifically Pfizer Moderna, November believe, really hunkered down. point, ending pandemic became matter time, effort. would go *now*, worst possible time life so, could see world return normal tangible tool? 

I gotta say, became patient monk terms pandemic behavior knew matter time. It‚Äôs still process spanning several months vaccine announcement herd immunity, it‚Äôs much easier waiting pandemic going keep going knows when. OH GAWD. 2 weeks, Florida handling exponential growth cases horrible super-spreader event? assuming cases going different parts country reason. California Dakotas could hit minimal/beginning threshold herd immunity 40-50 percent exposure well may reason cases declined (as Dakotas started decline big holidays). suspect Fauci follows science doesn‚Äôt easily feed echo chamber? internships available become incredibly competitive, especially they're online. longer competing local students. That's hilarious. karen's antimaskers make sure never ending Say shit america maple people Soo good us bad Canada? say, people figuring life navigate pandemic top that.

nothing done it, mental health awareness, especially America, joke Two problems suspected reinfections. First PCR test purposely designed allow False negative, gave false positives. FDA testing first PCR, 100 confirmed blood tests 1000 test showed 162 positive. started adjusting down.

We accept rate reinfections cause death spread thing matters right 2 deaths confirmed reinfection. way lower lightning strike. know get stuff twice, second time immune system prepared rarely results virus bad things. Matter fact studies human subject israeli article showed came back Turkey SA version spread two weeks family friends contact traced everyone. good news natural immunity.

People need accept never deaths virus. people get reinfected low enough rate matter.  course unless becomes first virus jump natural immunity wipe humans case vaccine matter.  It‚Äôs 10:45 et US. Anybody want take bet calls press conference within next 24 hours disavowing anything guy said, says, say? College highly regarded America workers rights working conditions wages shitty lot places college lot people never time money travel even take sick days off. 

I wanted 4 years American work hell. think people assuming worst virus variances vaccines may less effective for. They're also worried 16 crowd vaccine tested on. 

I think 2022 probably unreasonable, probably sort restrictions remain end year, light end tunnel 2021. Seeing bad getting understand why. ""Lockdowns"" effective effective leadership is. United States never truly hard locked one political party actually sabotaging efforts even attempt it. 

I really want get politics it, truth United States completely fragmented response, 50 different states 50 different answers one page beginning, get compliance buy in. cannot get everyone buy early on, always serious issues anyone taking seriously later on. hope ex-girlfriend killed father. authoritarians denial. can't look mirror see they've become.

There's herd immunity virus. strain counts growing time. need yearly shots waning efficacy time goes on. Covid going *anywhere*. learn accept increase risk partial immunity vaccines move on. suppose choice, would much rather live situation people overcautious someplace still insists ""it's flu."" I... guess?? sure remember reading paper similar conclusion 6 months ago Fair point. 
My comment mostly commenting US relation rest world/Canada, broad discussion world powers approaching issue.

I think time global selfishness Problem gap years friends go graduate without you. Yeah except 500k look like Atlanta. glad many young adults alive complain social constructs missed. Mindset priorities need aligning would seem. forget Connecticut, done relative good crisis control vaccine distribution #ctgang Aaand everyone stopped sharing got vaccinated. headstart previous administration. Thank doing. oh-ohhhhhhhhhhh, day oh-ohhhhhhh lost respect Fauci? Look selfish glasses wearing jerks killing grandma. can‚Äôt sacrifice vision weeks flatten curve?? /s Nope. lot either African American staff trust government vaccines, type nurses put lot faith crystals shit think need it. Haven‚Äôt following, new variants hitting places pretty hard now? Florida fudging numbers.
Also live southern CA, regularly see people know following guidelines all. One coworkers went party yesterday ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I'm pretty germ-adverse person. anxiety sufferer, know extreme fear unlikely situation keep truly living life. type fear huge problem, albeit personal problem that. 

My personal struggles anxiety unlikely situations given practice per day comes reintegrating others. Every time feel become anxious crowds again, next thought reminder nothing life risk free. attempting live risk free life really living. There's herd immunity virus.

Do honestly think achieve herd immunity virus mostly disappear? *seriously* believe this?

This entire discussion blown away. People actually believe vaccine going make covid go away. Expect yearly shots rest lives. strain counts increase time way create highly effective vaccines, cover certain strains.

This green pass system fool's errand. hurts civil liberties absolutely long term gain. get eye exam. Daily new cases low since I'll setting roadmap bring us lockdown cautiously, priority always getting children back school know crucial education well mental physical well-being, also prioritizing ways people reunite loved ones safely.  dispute Florida official count minority. Honestly surprised current administration hasn‚Äôt gotten spokesperson. Even take pressure general. Seven places regularly went gone good. 

Don‚Äôt try sugarcoat happened city. It‚Äôs disaster. people getting vaccine many people already there's antibodies population media nonstop coverage old people famous people, blame us feeling little abandoned? It‚Äôs way design. That‚Äôs constitution works. Health initiatives state power, federal power. Except post college prospects also damaged. Many people didn‚Äôt finish grad school arnt many slots open more.

Agreed J&amp;J one, miss type many people die. yeah pretty sizable serbian population here. great people. Risk benefit individual? another one?

OK. afraid happen result approved vaccines long term studies? 

Specifically, cause almost scientist shares concern.  

And 40% people afraid implies lot things - certainly correct fear. wave needs peaks troughs. US 3 waves, one worse last. point explain seemingly small number disaster large population. 

Less .3 percent worlds population died WW2. According logic, nothing worry about. 

Saying .15% applied 5 people, sure pretty good. thousand people, still pretty good. Applied 360 million people century disaster. 

Your reasoning isn‚Äôt sound can‚Äôt compared disasters. Using logic, wars aren‚Äôt bad kill .08% population. 

World War 2 wasn‚Äôt bad killed 400,000 Americans people.

I guess Spanish Flu bad either death os normal. reason behave differently save others lives.

You‚Äôre intentionally glib cover laziness. 

But none matters parents vaccinated get shot it‚Äôs turn. Know know watch Fauci video?   Florida/Alabama/Texas ever truly close? Actual Canadian here. Everything poster said misleading information. I'm feeling optimistic too, I'm sure agree doses + 60m current doses = 205m doses total. Assuming 66% group 1st 2nd dose, 205m *.66 = 135m people.

If 66% vaccinated people 2 doses, means 81.5m people 2 doses 42m one dose:

81.5m/(81.5m+42m) = 66%
1*42m + 2*81.5m = + 135m(vaccinated) = 263m infected/vaccinated ~76% population.

There's likely great deal overlap people infected people vaccinated. Many people already covid also get vaccine. Let's assume people covid get vaccine rate people covid (this might well bad assumption number reasons, anything better go of).

81.5m/330m = 25% total population received 2 vaccine doses

0.25*116m = ~29 million people infected covid received 2 doses vaccine. leaves 87 million people covid gotten vaccine doses.

So adding together infected vaccinated groups looks like this:

87m(infected) + 81.5m(vaccinated) = 168.5 million infected/vaccinated ~51% population.

This calculation also take account lag vaccines delivered vaccines getting arms. 145 million additional doses *delivered* early April mean 145 million additional doses *administered* early April.

That said, half country fully vaccinated by, say, late April/early May, still huge accomplishment. herd immunity, enough set us good summer. two months expect see many universities returning normal, although might wait summer break. always said I‚Äôm special

Glasses wearers tend minimum 10% special non-glasses wearers according NASA. everyone 16 vaccinated would truly insane maintain restrictions all.

Honestly, everyone middle aged older, sick immunocompromised vaccinated, that's acceptable end game. would nice totally wipe noone credibly argue restrictions stay place likelihood death serious illness measured fractions percent- point genuinely worse flu. LOL - 'lives shadows' - translation, he's seen videos BLM protest summer scared shitless remote possibility ever actually stepping foot NYC. Either that, he's Batman.

He's Batman, Batman chickenshit. It‚Äôs like America bypassed negative impacts though. whatever reason, many people self conscious social distancing wearing face covering. slow virus, seen countries. got vaccine twice now. tested positive covid. sure hope so. Case totals less concern trajectory downward rapid pace. Haha, yeah - I'll keep living NYC. enjoy whatever FauxNews telling life here.  I'm actually here, idea WTF talking about.

Bloody mind boggling. thinking thing. gonna safe go maskless right away. even enough people vaccinated don‚Äôt hate virus. hate society‚Äôs response it. Good point!

""That means Pfizer's vaccine must kept minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 158 Fahrenheit), requires special kind commercial freezer. vaccine stored five days regular refrigeration temperatures.

Pfizer said vaccine distributed thermal shippers, maintain ultra-cold temperatures using dry ice. vaccine last 30 days refilling shippers dry ice every five days."" AZ VaCciNe seConD RATE Gazza haven‚Äôt yet, sure Palestinian cities, Israeli Arab wish get sooner well everyone world It‚Äôs sad victim blame. seems willful ignorance ASPD lives rent free head. article refers Israel proper. Nothing Israel's reopening anything Palestinians living WB Gaza. Whether business schools PA remain open closed decision Palestinian government, ISrael. impressive.

Hopefully shut-up AZ nay-sayers subreddit. Oxford vaccine works job designed do: Stop serious cases COVID require hospitalisation. people love compare compete moment pfizer modern reporting 90%+ efficacy, combined AZ messing trials bit giving weird numbers 60% 80%+, means people attached one vaccine other.

SA variant may actually pretty bad AZ short term clearly good vaccine. initial trials run poorly data clearly now, AZ really good vaccine CICP lot problems paying claims according vaccine attorneys. fourth week receiving initial dose, Pfizer Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines shown reduce risk hospitalisation coronavirus Scotland 85% 94%, respectively.

So Biontech-Pfizer worse Oxford-Astrazeneca? gives good reason rush become vaccinated.  What‚Äôs point masks (and likely social distancing, separation family loved ones, lockdowns...I realize weren‚Äôt mentioned) continue next year beyond? even short term only. SA study looked young people highly effective hospitalisation protection we‚Äôre seeing wasn‚Äôt even tested. can‚Äôt tell either way says used even variants present. Also needs period ellipse unless middle sentence.... ""Gotta catch 'em all!""

I'd like first stamp vaccine passport, please! Billions people interest immigrating U.S.


Mean while, Canadas immigration increased hundreds thousands last 6 years Yeah, I've saying this, people West way much politicized listen. HCQ part standard treatment many countries, including LA, Africa, S. Asia. unnameable president. 

Now, work? serious doubts. got interested Surgisphere scandal, thinking might truly conspiracy, think seeing clear signal now. So, probably something enough truly make difference. Finn here. wonder rates low are, constitution allow government mandates force us use masks even public transport. would take kind exception (yes? Surely one?!?!!) apparently absolute last thing government wants go for.

I'm well versed political shenanigans, I've stayed home much possible, met 5 family members 3 friends face-to-face since started (not once, either), always wear mask (double masks nowadays), I'm royally pissed imbeciles care. I'm equally pissed since people stupid assholes, government stepped make masks mandatory *at least* public transport stores, least cities.

We started strong, summer looked like might leaning towards winning, guess people got tired careful, maybe stupidity, think vaccines countries magically affect us well? Now, death toll remains low, number infected keep rising. get proper supply vaccines, see changing.

I'm disappointed learning stupid many us Finns are. Free healthcare Woohoo two citizenships? Combined 81% hospitalisation 80's per article one dose

The 80's almost vaccinated. 

They constitute majority deaths. 

We're already 65+, adults summer

There's lot misinformation around vaccines generally. gambit like kind cuts that, whether believe misinformation, getting vaccinated still right thing family. kind news title make US americans feel better? know like, ""look one shallow hard compare way number higher theirs!"" shows exactly people got worked efficacy figures, especially different end points.

The best vaccine first one offered! Germany people refuse get vaccinated astrazeneca vaccine, disinformation... solid numbers, especially AZ (94% reduction hospitalisation) first dose. encouraging. I‚Äôd shocked confidence intervals don‚Äôt overlap. Absolutely fantastic news either way! Poland true, ur gonna get downvoted cuz sub shit Florida stage clear, combining two controversial decisions made - extending dosage interval, could result mutations, prematurely approving lower-efficacy AZ vaccine, could result inability deploy ‚Äúfixed‚Äù version effective South African strain near future UK. 

Thanks clarification. sounds like suggesting let people die now, give survivors better vaccine might exist six nine months time. I'm surprised view I'd come across before.

Anyway, like (kind old-young person got royally fucked), know alone. haven't, UK government's vaccination prioritisation strategy age. healthcare care home workers exception. Working logic age key factor determines survival chances, teachers 60+ (or even 50+ depending quickly local area vaccinating populations) first vaccination time schools open again, purely based age rather profession.

This happened russian vaccine middle phase III trial (check news Dezcember) . 

No one Russia cared control groups vaccinated, decided use earlier data: auto translator works good site

not necessarily true, even wear mask said thing abt vaccine besides patting back it. death grip 40% country use power, valid criticism. agree broader point abt double standard two. Biden bear full responsibility wherever pandemic goes enter March.  fuck wrong you? Everyone realizes that, people still suffer AZ developed mind. created UK‚Äôs help manufacturing plan reused countries. Many countries developed AZ manufacturing capabilities without AZ taking profit. 

It takes time sooner start faster get vaccines. Eg EU started bit later UK delays it‚Äôs still producing lot AZ vacccines cost. 

Canada could done preparations too. AZ designed allow poor countries produce vaccine. I‚Äôm sure Canada could managed. happened, think even blame biden. federal government absolutely nothing leaves states we'll get back full normal end 2021, maybe like november. would absolutely devastating variant completely eludes vaccines, basically setting us back square one. we're back basically full normal september, think confidently say Biden admin failed response could've done. Surprisingly things take priority going bars clubs parties there's pandemic level infectious disease going around. may Impostor. big ass numbers vaccines.

Sampling bats Hubei province wildlife across China revealed SARS-CoV-2 date. You‚Äôre completely twisting narrative looking clues support pre-ordained conspiracy theory. 

The media equally bungling narrative around mRNA vaccines failing acknowledge mounting evidence prevent infection well symptoms. would media prop sales vaccines one moment give misleading information supports anti-vax positions next (i.e., vaccines don‚Äôt actually anything)? Could public health information hard communicate? someone always intentionally lying? 

Also, it‚Äôs AZ getting type skepticism. AZ, J&amp;J, Novavax reported efficacy two mRNA options met misplaced disappointment. What‚Äôs likely, vast international media misinformation campaign prop profits 2 4 for-profit vaccines, public media got little spoiled unexpectedly good results first two vaccines?

You‚Äôre alleging malicious intent real evidence. It‚Äôs dangerous anti-public health. Hydroxychloroquine example referenced, you‚Äôre Trump alleging vast conspiracy instead obvious answer: treatments appear work better. 

I fucking sick conspiracy theory infecting every aspect lives. I‚Äôm sorry sound like dick, think you‚Äôre alleging misguided, dangerous, shows penchant drama evidence. premise ... little askew.

Notice, original statement, clear state 90% population still susceptible. So, vaccinated people analysis would contracted disease infected person.

At point say vaccinated people contracted disease vaccination. literally impossible, especially mRNA vaccines. 

It impossible vaccinated person spread disease. Read polio shot, vaccination oral polio vaccination. Study first topic commenting it, please, irresponsible comments way moving faster correct ones. cases dropping areas world completely different seasons. Enlighten me. could Italy better less? Lombardy alone (a NY-like region) 0.27% mortality rate (that is, deaths population) COVID, population size Swden. letting people gather together would fought better virus? Fauci says can't compare different countries. know better science data backing up? likely already know mask vaccinated they're going tell people general public vaccinated probably May June US. special tests, think anyone ever gets results tests given them, least I've heard happening. 

In terms personally, matter get one variants, ""clinical presentation"", far.

The variation disease severity cases single variant still waaaaaaaay astronomically higher variants. So, like, pretty much proportion people asymptomatic D614g B117 B1351. known symptom differences variants, were, we'd start calling strains. (lots people using ""strain"" incorrectly lately) 

So variants really matter population scale right now.

You'd think B117 *that* much contagious, we'd, know, see big spike UK, like anywhere.

Instead, variants seem thing right now.  think public really needs start pushing back happens, there‚Äôs 200+ million adults country, think majority wouldn‚Äôt want shutdowns next winter. people want vaccine get it, people don‚Äôt don‚Äôt, children mostly lower fatality risk comparable respiratory illnesses. 

Doesn‚Äôt even need confrontational, don‚Äôt shut keep everything open. eagerly awaiting data impact vaccination infections, hospitalizations deaths.

Seems like dragging feet here. Vaccines working UK. understand continuing lockdowns Pretty much zero chance causes meaningful spike, least US. 

We're far vaccination process infection rates dropping rapidly. early April, expect even dramatic. COVID certainly eradicated think we'll back normalcy yet either, far off, things considered. 

Not mention, Easter major traveling/family holiday way Thanksgiving Christmas are. People might get together Easter dinner, part live near anyway. parts country, Easter weather usually warm enough celebrations could held outside (or someone's garage raining). 

Will people get COVID result Easter celebration? Sure, would extremely shocked happens rate anywhere CLOSE considered spike. says reduction hospitalization. severity symptoms ? reduction transmission? Honestly it‚Äôs light now.

Also, California 49,344 covid deaths far - still twice Canada's total, even though roughly population. no, US still way people dying. Yeah I‚Äôm pandemic. Feel like I‚Äôve hit wall. waiting get vaccine Correct. We've bought combination AstraZeneca, Pfizer-BionNTech Sinovac. know that. Nice article way. 

As others pointed covid risks quite varied - far less 1% far higher elderly. 

I still drive car. two stats really comparable? 1% covid death rate per infection occurred within last 12 months. start driving 15 drive 65 years till I'm 80 1% rate 65 years 65X lower covid. Generally speaking. 

Re falls, wear shoe grips snow hold handrail balance exercises. know older folks broke bones falling good. want mitigate covid masks, distancing washing. variant hits live might become hermit three months get vaccine. don‚Äôt think reasonable person would assume .2-.3 reduction worth cratering economy. it‚Äôs said done, it‚Äôs likely places didn‚Äôt close surging economy areas struggle decade-long recession.

Which countries referring now? Sweden often used example country close schools restaurants/bars. economy ""cratered"" much neighbours' (Finland, Norway Denmark) close down. difference compared neighbours', Sweden's covid deaths 5-10 times higher. 

One successful countries covid China much harsher lockdown Wuhan done anywhere else. current numbers low able open economy. 

1.25 compared 1 R0 means number cases double 3 infection cycles (\~5 days), 2 weeks. That's pretty much rate infections increasing UK December early January (before current lockdown started effect). So, drop 0.25 R0 latest peak would completely avoided. 

Could tell me, moving ""closing schools"" level drop (0.3-0.45) ""good"" drop 0.2-0.3 associated closing non-essential businesses ""pointless""? magical point R0 reduction value 0.3 method changes ""good"" ""pointless""? 

And anyway, limit gatherings smaller 10 people, *most* effective method according study lower R0 (more effective closing schools), alone would mean still close many types businesses. completely delusional. hyperbole say ""many Germans French"" (not 'everyone' comment suggests said). article read, 3000 appointments German locale AZ shots, 200 showed appointment. Nurses Belgium threatening strike they're given AZ vaccines. 

It's sadly going common issue, due false info put EU; eg offer protection 65s, rushed without proper testing. happens misinfo released political purposes, really sad see body believe stoop it. get double get sliced ninjas say that? say whatever wants. US purposes, local labs direction/recommendation/orders state's public health agency ones spinning PCRs determine infections. knowledge, states changed deem highest level PCR spits acceptable determine positive case. 

WHO made recommendation much like they've made recommendations lockdowns masks - see much followed. Would energy said opposite? employer anything check vaccinated anything. Sending what? Second-grade vaccine? Check.

Sending much? Almost nothing? Check. Problem including cause easy make numbers look better blaming something else death.

Was loads countries early Corona example 5k dead 8k excess mortality. Remember tech companies got together build digital contract tracing make difference hardly uptake? That's like. get mean this. early mortality difference pretty easy understand. It‚Äôs post summer holiday find interesting.

There‚Äôs reason defend Sweden‚Äôs denial mask usage. would made big difference. West Virginia, Florida Texas arguably beautiful best-climated areas live US. I‚Äôll leave ‚Äúbut‚Äù... everybody else know rest story. Barrington future robotic vaccine program reaches every single wild animal carry covid, never go way smallpox. AZ 100% efficacy severe cases (no hospitalization required). So, 95% efficacy exactly line findings.

(According third phase interim results paper, 0 hospitalizations vaccination arm, 8 hospitalizations, 1 severe 1 death placebo arm). still crazy me.

I know one personally gotten COVID died it. couple long lost connections Facebook, that‚Äôs random celebrity it, don‚Äôt know them. know them, social circle intact. Producing [highly vaccine cost, disappointing. language country

Nooooooope try again. Actually don't. It‚Äôs AP article direct site, hell going about? strike antivaccine. strikes sceptical pharmaceutical companies data. OK ""possible"" people going ignore it.. actually know vaccinated. Better everyone continue wear mask allow people go ""I'm definitely vaccinated trust me"" real horrifying. Even think awful nation handles chronic disease (think: gulf war syndrome). seems suggest AZ vaccine works better Pfizer vaccine one dose. took surprise.

If like here, Pfizer vaccine reserved risk, frailest firemen police getting vaccinated AZ, (exception medical staff got pfizer soon possible). Might effect control groups important science. Well, noted stay home orders top everything else.  offer smaller marginal benefit everything else, likely time get stay home orders, there‚Äôs already ton restrictions.  Definitely suggests absolute last resort though. TheQuint propaganda website disguised news website. hope gets blacklisted subreddit least. Sounds like good rationale enforce glasses mandate finished rest world. It‚Äôs basically big holiday Catholics Northeast, one else celebrates level do. even then, family parties. don‚Äôt really understand many peoples positions taken last year. Although it‚Äôs goalposts moved many times prime Janikowski couldn‚Äôt split uprights. ever evolving position seems anything personal enjoyment without wearing hazmat suit you‚Äôre piece trash. Reddit tells hold position I‚Äôll always get upvotes must something right! mainly use Pfizer clear though. 

The results likely similar may diverge subset efficacy. data Pfizer, less effective vaccines like J&amp;J AZ? vaccines already required school many places. employers require depending field you‚Äôre in, though admittedly rare simply gotten critical ones kid. already exists much smaller degree. I've one careful people sub hesitate drive across country situation. Stay motels rather hotels minimize time around people. fine. teacher, ditto Denmark Norway use masks spring large differences countries started happen. reason large mortality difference mask usage. Yes used people aged 60-65 years healthcare workers, means groups able make appointments get vaccinated stock situation resolved again. Astra Zeneca also released information intend deliver beyond March making difficult EU countries plan ahead. can't answer firstquestion certainty, I've never encountered vaccine high efficacy. yes, common sense, would tell us, stop spread virus, ""common sense"" neither common sensible, scientists rely empirical observations instead. Regular flu shots different type vaccine (traditional vs RNA vaccine). time may saved approvals, time would absolutely saved development (like things, second time goes smoothly). Additonaly, funds would allocated vaccine development way sooner. However, would still need go trials make sure effective.

All said, reserve materials hand, timeline new Corona virus disease vaccine rollout would probably much faster. uneducated guess says around 6 month mark. expecting AZ make difference first place. Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson Johnson, CureVac job. Shhh get facts people pandering people real measurable evidence.

Everything virus since May mostly predictable, worked well using math science see trends would play out. exact numbers there‚Äôs always sense cases would go would go down. understand, then, lockdown seemed like bigger pain virus perspective. However, please consider, moment, sheer statistics alone measured. 

It‚Äôs almost like aware participating war doesn‚Äôt impact personally, one loved ones gets shipped unless entire town abuzz recruiters. Nevertheless, might tasked rationing purchases certain goods, producing certain materials taking difficult different work, support military effort. draining, incredibly hard work, pull together greater good. better it, collectively (collectively operative word), sooner nightmare ends. 

When think Australia things, vs Sweden, brainer. h c k e r üòÇ surplus excess death top known Covid deaths nations. US 20%-30% deaths usual even Covid deaths subtracted. think likely under-reported Covid deaths lockdown deaths two reasons: 1. Nations counts probable Covid deaths (the dying person Covid symptoms never tested positive) Covid deaths excess mortality, example Belgium. 2. Nations hard lockdowns suffer major Covid death waves excess mortality (New Zealand fact negative excess mortality). Take together think US global death toll due Covid under-counted, over-counted. It‚Äôs even driving, passenger ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù Phrasing! though, stopping hospitalisations? Well that.

[AZ 10% efficacy South African instead J&amp;J (Janssen) 57%. Indian numbers days old. today India administered 11Milion+ doses, roughly 1% population.

India giving 2 Million doses day next month already stock hundred million doses. Right priority Healthcare workers. Agreed - even seeing reputable journals. read Nature article day there's way results would reproducible lab, haha.

There's enough scrutiny experimental data, sometimes.. Latest Israel shows higher protection weeks. Ah yes, must horrible company selling vaccine cost. Technology temporary fix. know: think comparing two numbers oversimplification, study (unsurprisingly) well ahead challenge. a) Israel care, Israel gets vaccine exclusive EU.

b) 2000 22000 matter all. least two millions make difference. Better three millions.

This delivery pure publicity Kremlin. Floridian here, believe say Orlando shut March May. Even Disney World Universal closed months. Honestly, interesting opportunity too. friend called birthday enter Zoom many friends really awesome. would mad decreasing / eliminating spread. parts miss. fave TV shows like Community table reads. one gave fuck work. Every country spot wasn‚Äôt envy looking countries. didn‚Äôt shame pandemic weight yet. memes great.

Season 2 terrible far. Oh yeah lemme take $30,000 loan instead finishing four years $5,000 per year rate get scholarships. 

Not sure recommend going debt lmfao

Edit: already loans cover last $5,000. I‚Äôm first gen college student. family doesn‚Äôt lot money. restrictions next winter, everyone wants vaccine gotten it, mean restrictions every winter? sense next winter look much different terms covid winter that. God. ever leave house this? Life risks. Generations prior us faced far risks didn‚Äôt cower homes. faced deadlier debilitating diseases. drafted wars. worked dangerous jobs. told could bombed minute. fewer safety measures things like transportation. hardly medical treatments. 

What bunch soft ass whimpy people we‚Äôve raised. We're ready entirely lift lockdown yet, nowhere near enough people vaccinated - 27% simply enough.

If lifted would spread like wildfire amongst young people yet vaccinated. there's possibility variants, could put entire thing risk. 70m people protection vaccination estimates 1/3 population natural immunity, way we‚Äôre almost entirely done covid May? know would ahead timelines, seems like fewer fewer people susceptible covid matter couple months. unable set boundaries so, exam period, literally studying 12+ hours day. went week without leaving one room student apartment want lose time studying. Outside Tampa Kansas City, don‚Äôt think many people gave shit super bowl year. 

Asking people skip Christmas dealbreaker lot people, event that‚Äôs eating junk food front TV? It‚Äôs big ask get people super bowl party. went exponential increase significant decline cases January 12, corresponding least 20% decrease reproductive rate essentially overnight happened right around New Years. could due vaccination natural immunity, cause gradual changes. lot people actually changed behavior (though perhaps small amount).

Yea, holidays people stopped gathering. Combine worst parts winter keep people home big drop transmission. Magic 5x likely walk blindly traffic fogged glasses...amiright?

Has anyone found solution works fogged glasses?  One people follow Twitter (local journalist, rando) talking someone said ‚Äúif could follow data shut two weeks stop spread virus, apparently that‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much‚Äù‚Äù

Yes. Yes indeed ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù

Gotta love people trying go back square 1. Come grandma. Let give nice big hug. people live April May, even spike, think anybody rollback.

When cat gets bag regards normalcy, putting cat back least hope.

Theoretically, even spike younger people hospital capacity concern. May/June every risk person would option vaccine. Legacy media died 10 years ago Biden basically said thing? What?? Where? must see this! would like live asthma like conditions rest life? I'm turning 30 2 months. live Florida mitigations measures I've taken apart public masking self-imposed.

I want go Applebee's, want go bar, want party, want goddamn hug. parts enjoyed sure. actually pretty good time learned sew. Yes that's point. Efficacy 10-70%. Compare BioNTech Modern 95%+

Adeno-virus based. re-vaccination, difficult modify, may quite dangerous due injecting virus DNA cell DNA(this possible).

The contract signed factory, shady AstraZeneca. Mean bosses Astrazeneca forgotten inform EU, can't fulfill contract. crime. Fauci basically walk back ‚Äúmasks 2022‚Äù comment. Sounds like even team Biden didn‚Äôt like one. honest, looking Table 2 (near end paper) find headline hard understand.

To simple brain, column 3 (# events) divided column 2 (person years) shows ""incidence"".With vaccine, looks around 0.5%. Without vaccine, looks 1%.

That seem like 94% reduction. maybe misunderstanding something here... people predicting Super Bowl spike nowhere seen looking total excess deaths compared previous years, ignoring that. Government funded someone work. Capitalism reason deployed quickly is. think pfizer administrators give shots free? 

There‚Äôs reason United States front end vaccine it‚Äôs money. Plain simple. Several reasons:
1. cases actually rising Arab Israeli community. least vaccinated group. Massive efforts done leaders health teams get people vaccinated, helping, still many people vulnerable. 
2. 60+ vaccinated. 82% 60-70 group (most resistant), 98% 70-80 group, 90% 80-90 group 94% 90+ group. Quite lot, everyone. 
3. Many many young people even kids teens got covid positive. Yesterday 32y/o pregnant woman died (and baby) üò¢. brother law anti vax facebook group. 

Still clear vaccines working. might Israel stops blocking vaccines reaching Palestinians Places affected winter storm testing all, people gone hospital didn't, mess numbers generally. since Christmas Actually far know keep safety stock AZ vaccine all, give longer interval doses, since started using it, might stock. AZ given GPs GGDs depending mobile enough go mass vaccination center. doomed second started. pandemic election year one anything sit home, read news build resentment things? Time bomb. anyone actually enjoy first lockdown? people tiktok looking back wishing could go back it. feel like crazy hated first lockdown. taking french German news gospel ignoring basically everything else propaganda.

Source that? 
Who would read German French news across continent? dont one neighboring state. People history allergies specifically waiting J&amp;J well. AstraZeneca thus far delivered 736,800 doses vaccine Germany, Robert Koch Institute (RKI), country‚Äôs center disease control, says 106,586 doses vaccine administered. states building stockpiles medicine. Hesse received 58,000 doses, Monday, 851 math looks like you‚Äôre right. % people 20 65 11368 9% percentage 10075 16%. really surprised low UES! always seem ton old people around there, maybe really E. 80s. one cares. matters results - results Morocco vaccinated EU. know say. Fool once... Good post. agree. People think know happen dishonest. Wait see getting mad hypothetical one way other. Pretty much. chose keep lockdowns/restrictions place even deaths/hospitalizations dropped early summer curve ""flattened"", made decision contain covid costs, even costs ultimately outweigh harm virus itself. decision seemed justified time given uncertainty, massive mistake IMO. We're going living silent fallout rest lives. Yeah, Sweden compares well Europe, horribly Nordic countries. Everyone knows this. would likely regulated FDA. specific aspect FDA's policy pandemic nuanced go back FDA multiple times clarify policy many companies unique situations. Please note previous statement way meant condescending antagonistic (tone hard via text).

Per ""Enforcement Policy Face Masks Respirators Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Public Health Emergency (Revised)""

""Face masks, face shields, respirators devices intended medical purpose, prevention infectious disease transmission (including uses related COVID-19).""

You correct would medical device FDA makes determination device intended medical purpose.

FDA goes state guidance: 

When evaluating whether products intended medical purpose, among considerations, FDA consider whether:

1) labeled otherwise intended use HCP;
2) labeled otherwise use health care facility environment; and
3) include drugs, biologics, anti-microbial/anti-viral agents. 

It item 3 source interactions FDA face masks used general public. interpretation Item 3 includes devices technological features imbue device anti-viral anti-microbial properties. 

If different experience would love hear it.


Reg future 510(k): 21 CFR 878.4040 ineffective general

Right, thanks letting know worth paying attention to. Let know know talking about. Yes, also posting ample sources multiple comments. 

It certainly causation look bigger picture. I‚Äôm probably gona get banned using letters anyway. Get loan last year to. happen. Well, water **makes** things wet sure, **is** wet? variant strike! End 2022 likely health care system (Sweden's, is) tad complicated small country. fact. Social isolation stuck inside really put dent peoples' critical thinking skills. You‚Äôre fool incapable rationalizing situation lol last time people weren‚Äôt vaccinated - point  pretty shit vaccine otherwise it? Well, would useful read study, blaming something claim doing. 

They use Bayesian modelling, which, far understand observation find methods main effect explaining observation. So, basically compare many different countries many different methods place country X method country difference infections, little effect. big difference favor X, large effect. many people already self-imposed lockdowns formal order, course see big impact. 

Yes, question ""governmental NPI mandates"" work, really matter. answer would still government mandated stay home order much. study would still useful government. would know closed non-essential part economy schools, need order people stay home top that. Either people anyway stay home self-imposing lockdown staying home matter. Regardless one is, government order stay-at-home order. think would get best sense works looking things like location credit card data, see type behaviors actually led different outcomes. 

But we're interested credit card purchases, infections. We're interested methods lower infections. People going schools universities anything credit card purchases, according study big effect infections. thing people gather private homes. also produce card payments, spread virus. must Huntington Beach. Lol world dude, weird. üòÇ put words mouth, never said things. Get high horse Well flu season nonexistant corona right now. strategy using deal corona virus works ordinary flue well. that's also indirect caused corona virus. ignore that? vaccine proven ineffective SA strain ineffective general. 

Also vector-based vaccine, bad definition.

AZ typical second-grade vaccine. Nobody wants AZ. NOBODY. care. mean salaried workers happens far frequently.

Imagine EU would admit UK made better vaccine, sells cheaper, larger quantities, Boris Johnson made better deal outside EU's vaccination campaign allows UK leave lockdown 6 months earlier.

If still EEC, UK left, everyone could benefit. EU hateful organisation knows make enemies, friends. studies coming conclusion vaccines effectively decrease spread. still going cry freedom getting vaccinated proven actually decrease spread? looked data say anything certain, neighborhood 4 restaurants closed that's one area. expensive neighborhood though, might way, still. Well said that's I'll greatful boris allows us go back person uni classes March cause man miss taking classmates even talk much former administration made people believe faulty response would save lives, anything differently work, option nothing. course, know turned out.

People often misuse substances factors lives make life unbearable. Abuse, unemployment, untreated/undertreated mental illness chronic pain, etc... created culture many us don‚Äôt access resources need healthy. Instead looking address deficits, blame substances.

Those merely buying pain meds street included ‚Äòopioid crisis‚Äô count, difficult/impossible made get doctors... isn‚Äôt like got cut abusing meds needing them. Legit chronic pain patients abandoned left right doctors simply stop prescribing pain meds altogether.

The nation cusp milestone: 500,000 lives lost, one year.

That unbelievable number losses. one year. sad! made whole lot assumptions It‚Äôs you. They‚Äôre using disgusting ideology, including ‚ÄúI qualms many people die‚Äù ‚Äúif parents die Covid oh well‚Äù. It‚Äôs insane. direct interactions I‚Äôve today. 

Be well stay strong! helping make sure fewer people get infected that‚Äôs something take pride in! Yeah, well guys also massive amount cases Asked CNN‚Äôs Dana Bash whether Americans need continue masking next year, Dr. Anthony Fauci responded: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs possible that‚Äôs went predict U.S. see degree think we‚Äôll significant degree normality‚Ä¶as get fall winter end year,‚Äù said.  think it‚Äôs fair criticize US‚Äô initial handling pandemic, doesn‚Äôt mean also praise job that‚Äôs done since certain date month ago.

Perhaps changes winter proceeds spring summer. yet. Wear around people. Let‚Äôs hope numbers decrease worldwide. indoor public settings either vulnerable groups fully vaccinated vaccine supply exceeds vaccine demand.

In case, bad vaccine was, imagine getting bad case virus. Yeah often worry generation ostracized job market significant part degrees done online disagree interpretations last events list, recall fine.

I'm merely pointing sad cold truth nations produce drug domestically spending less GDP per capita running deficits also vaccinating population faster Canada is.

Whether believe impact past conservative government action discouraged domestic vaccine production today, relative failure vs similar nations (i.e. produce domestically) independent events, focus argument.

We need capable leader get job done, spending borrowing achieve middling results.

We need public obsess I'm partisan finger pointing focuses solutions today, tomorrow.

It's ""normal"" keep business one sector healthcare workers (hospital staff) worked brink last year

Oh they've 'worked brink' (unlikely) ignore Covid? mean businesses pushed brink ignore regulation covid go back operating usual?

Why one set circumstances, making life-altering sacrifices. comes nurses, can't even ask work one weekend per month? hold vaccine rollout. contacting elderly persons, setting sites getting enough doses shipped administer persons 

False. Putting shots arms holdup. elderly waiting line doses rotting freezers. data's available; tell worldview scientifically incorrect. totally get that, agree rough years lose, know people ton shit also dealing with. main point grass always greener, diminish going thru feeling, focusing people may better tends make feel worse situation totally self inflicted.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Tell half million dead Americans. perhaps. hope not, but..... yeah Palistinians? 

Shit ain't think read USA average life expectancy rates dropped full year since pandemic began. It‚Äôs probably Fauci lied multiple times lost public trust. Seems like 1000cases last sunday glasses glasses tend associated people perfectly comfortable wearing something face helps avoid dying? answer. one year old spending time outside it‚Äôs 40*, starting play dirt, rocks pinecones. small farm, moved chickens, dogs, cats far.

FWIW, baby Covid 3 mos. immune system challenge don‚Äôt recommend, pull okay. wonderful spent time year sick. I‚Äôve never use Nose Frida, worry high fevers, deal roseola, croup, colds, flu, whooping cough...

Again - realize prove true, right? Like, states put dashboards thing called internet, see lying. believe masking social distancing, point amount people *statistically* something fear virus far outnumbered people anything fear. old immunocompromised ones lockdown, rest nation could've continued lives masks better sanitation vaccine made. Idk we're restricting elementary, middle school, high school students living they've got little fear covid. Omg thank you! need stop reading comments posts. People seriously angry people don‚Äôt mind wearing mask?? What?? lot people said he's aiming underpromising overdelivering since things tense us fast enough lose another summer would definitely that. conspiracy theories please Probably lot Serbian fans. Also don‚Äôt think Australians eagerly awaiting vaccines much enjoying life again. article? explain Morocco, Turkey Mexico ahead us? never said ""work without break."" But, no, think nurses get every weekend holiday off. rest us asked make life-altering sacrifices, surely give relaxation time. That's much ask. People lost businesses, homes, etc. fair expect nurse work one weekend day holiday per month return. x üíØ happens someone w/ Covid given vaccine? You‚Äôre welcome :) sorry loss! Literally would require path last six weeks continue. current R(t), would 8000 cases per day nationally mid-April. 


Of course, things could also drop faster that, given vaccination program. lol thought trump left plan place ?!?!?!?!?!?! certainly hope too. I‚Äôm sending child back get vaccinated. autistic sensory issues wearing mask day question. Even home school couple months, I‚Äôll wait. taking chances. 

And coming someone already vaccinated work education well. know kids large fine I‚Äôm taking chances. Morocco Turkey Mexico better us despite significantly less clout, would put blame? Again, yes, know places like California (LA sure) 1/3 least, exposure. Compound vaccinations getting there. beginning glimpses erd immunity certain places, time pandemic, cannot discounted. may everywhere, California might close. LA Times, probably first large media outlet even admit this, yesterday. places may mobility/holidays over, may like California. think may mistake people assuming. USA closer most, however. looking forward going prom dress shopping her. 

me right, remembered hearing gonna allow travel get shut small outbreak might see commercials vaccines point. rate currently vaccinating, within couple months going run situation demand, supply, limiting factor vaccinations. 

I think hardcore anti-vaxxers outnumbered people either ""vaccine hesitant"" care enough put effort get vaccine. groups could persuaded get vaccinated right messaging. People fucking babies üôÑ That's said. watched interview CNN morning. right. Thanks Trump actually pandemic combat people vaccinate.

Thank god Trump. Without need vaccine. Boy really telling truth going create jobs! guess missed asterisk jobs would come thanks people died due lack management.

Lmao!! True. hate freaking virus. Yes are. Oxford university began clinical trials 6+ year olds. would argue half million americans died little bit worse. Sucks life's hold technology hard continue better really lost anything perhaps socially close earned notches headboard. That‚Äôs even close true scientifically proven people think way. I've heard great quote: Americans always right thing they've tried everything else.

I think captures perfectly. perfectly fine communicator don‚Äôt actively try listen him

You overestimate intelligence attention span average American graduated college &amp; home since last March (lost senior year). Totally sympathize you. Fucking sucks situation, promise you‚Äôll live come sophomore year. Everyone‚Äôs gonna happy back. 

Be sure ready time comes. Keep touch friends you‚Äôve made virtually year dive straight campus life get back next year joining clubs/Greek life meeting people dorm. Hopefully subreddit isn‚Äôt representative real life, people actually go get vaccine. 

It feels like way Covid deniers months ago.  lot pharmaceutical companies work research trial studies partnership provincial healthcare services universities/teaching schools. [Going war work teach means fight jobs, proving efficacy, safety managing low production costs constantly struggling funding. 

‚ÄúDavid said shift personalized medicine based genetics require governments target investments university medical labs small startup biotech firms 10 20 workers.

""The problem happen short-term,"" academic said.‚Äù

Instead Conservatives cutting things. efficiently killed vulnerable economic period much like dismantling education healthcare Alberta Ontario provincial level. prove it‚Äôs ‚Äúbroken‚Äù go ahead replace privatized version buddies. Like health minister [Tyler

Unfortunately people actually step help sacrifice typically ones suffer suffering benefits whole. 40th summer peak here. stayed home nothing one biggest birthdays people's lives. people missed important life events, try make it. Hopefully almost over. I'm boomer, generational comments rub wrong way. I'm sure older people disregarding mask requirements. I'm also sure younger people same, going parties, etc. 

Personally, really feel college aged nephews. They've robbed great senior year HS freshman year college. also know they've acting recklessly older people family.

Well gee know, let's go read actual Look New Zealand.

Alright, let's look New Zealand. several weeks complete lock down.

Ah, answer question. New Zealand several weeks complete lock down. Let's whole world done that

Done what? Well, let's read back find exactly think whole world several weeks complete lock down.

Ah! old friend. Good know. So, now? ""If whole world done several weeks complete lock down"". Alright. Let's talking fast vaccine distributed virus would eliminated.

So, two-part sentence, ""if/then"" statement. know ""if"" part was. Let's put together! entire proposal, outlined here, ""If whole world done several weeks complete lock talking fast vaccine distributed virus would eliminated."" shorten ""If whole world done several weeks complete lock down, virus would eliminated"".

Let's persists finding new hosts.

""It"" referring Stop spreading goes away completely.

""It"" referring require full aggressive lock everyone cooperating.

""It"" refers situation getting rid virus. oh look! good friend ""aggressive lock **everyone** cooperating"". Interesting said exact words yet accuse trying make situation less clear.

We'll skip little bit closing everyone actually obey strict lock weeks would gone.

Well would ya look that. thing before.

I would like try explain exactly think preposterous came conclusion ""You proposed entire world locks acts optimal manner two weeks"" based words said. assuming? replying guy assuming mobility/holiday season surge said ""this right answer"" Damn. I've never thought two categories really seem right. always felt odd massive successful endeavors: Silicon Valley (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Tesla, Microsoft, etc), Wall Street, Hollywood, etc. massive global economic cultural implications. tragic failures: mass incarceration, failing infrastructure, rampant homelessness.

It makes sense successes mostly something produced profited from. even root cause horrible humanitarian problems: private prisons influencing criminal laws, extreme pricing tuitions healthcare, etc. one market cornered missed experiences; life stage loss. article backlog reporting deaths fudging data. Yes states delays reporting, what's conspiracy government slowing release deaths make count look better moment? February, massive Thanksgiving Christmas death surges accounted we'd already seen effects now. 


What argument? Florida secretly way worse reported numbers far 2 months they'll skyrocket top backlogged deaths finally reported. spite congruency daily cases, death, hospitalization, excess death trends. giant disparity deaths attributed covid delay reporting covid deaths - expect uncharacteristically high excess deaths Florida, oh wait particularly high excess deaths, sky high hospitalization rate focus article whole situation affected young people, deaths. Yet still brought make ""stop complaining"" point. Japanese people almost neurotic taking Japanese pharmaceuticals? least Japanese friends were. Even prevent spread, seem like cause mass hospitalization deaths enough people vaccinated. sure they're about. get comparison made delays. vaccine used US first round end story. Probably used boosters later need economy didn‚Äôt crash. Small businesses received PPP could received Trump didn‚Äôt bail big corporations instead. Millennials zoomers screwed happy around love alive. kind twisted thoughts protect corona cult world view right? Since original question removed mod incivility, ask. include happy news Israel vaccinations, include exclude Palestine? It‚Äôs good federal grounds. often one federal grounds? mask mandates cancelled worth crashing economy destroying small businesses? much human wreckage cause, screwing millennials zoomers?  listen to? expert researchers /u/who-what

Hmmmmm  OK. reason distrusting new things. therapeutic treatments turn bad side effects want help end life altering pandemic.

Now, censorship talking about. that? think conspiracy stifle scientific dissent? Say clearly. code. Yeah all. increases temporary quietly vanished September 2020. 
Go ask local essential manufacturer much thanks got, ""hero pay"" no, almost certainly didnt get that, screwed coworkers started getting sick, orders started showing workers could hired theres enough space shop (or nobody wants work suckhole) coworkers get sick, shop must continue produce oh-so-essential whatever. Well takes fun federal mask mandate US others thinking like compassionate like think be. often not, share similar thinking ones social distancing, masking correctly all, still behaving like it‚Äôs hoax. Big picture still ALIVE. I‚Äôm sure many consider social constructs awesome. I‚Äôm glad survived that‚Äôs without pandemic contend with. 

What happening. continue hang can‚Äôt have? persevere finish started school going right support closest community? Yes mindset ‚Äúfixed‚Äù aligned priorities. sake, hope don‚Äôt stay way. Hahaha, here. Wearing glasses, got covid back July. see young folks hanging think ""good you""

I feel well now. Back last spring would hear unit young people complex people would *livid*. Flash forward week ago: neighbors seemed karaoke night signing loudly badly hours, keep grin face. 

I want people, old young, fun again. especially young people. need joy lives. thought Palestine country? vaccine shown reduce transmission significantly shown sources posted another commenter. Wear it‚Äôs trouble wear it, don‚Äôt need wear it. Yes. Mentioning 500,000 Americans died ‚Äúdownplaying‚Äù covid. You‚Äôre right Yeah, vaccinations stop virus. going die Covid. Yep. feel like I‚Äôve completely lost social skills. confirm, college admissions right kind shitshow. really hope get lucky. 

Source: currently waiting apps come back  parents elderly. isolation aged tremendously. cut activities love, community longer offers transportation services. barely see anyone besides family ‚Äî together, worried getting sick maintain 6 feet distance hugs physical contact. brutal. maybe dude talks much? someone became new mom two months pandemic, this.

I've always suffered anxiety, anxiety like I've never experienced. Canadian here. shitting bed vaccination. Think I‚Äôll start going without mask speed up...üò± listen Fauci, hes flip flopped stance COVID much last year, likes hearing voice. Listen doctors actually still see patients. really. face face person wholesome psychologically. again, we're talking hospitals longer overwhelmed Yes also curious vaccine effected fingernail growth speed skins ability tan without burning. Drugs years research recalled time. censorship wonder don‚Äôt see scientist saying otherwise. vaccine never mandatory States. Especially president Joe Biden calls genocide cultural difference. CP24 Toronto based... Oh no! great thing, sorry, tone may gone annoyed there. not. debatably best messaging anyone Covid. Inauguration trick I'm sorry, assuming every region declining reason. want picky...isn't ""fewer"" usually associated things would count, ""less"" associated amounts counted? case, we're counting percentage points, we're referring block people identified using percentage... currently know people vaccine virus. Strange considering come large ( lucky ) family. know what, that's fair point, I'm sure deal school closures year+ kids around house day can't easy too.

I guess getting tough everyone, addition toughness situation younger people also missing important milestones career opportunities simply never come back, whose effect ripple long pandemic. Sure, sucks everyone now, there's generation people still carry disadvantage shitty two years disrupted pandemic lockdowns also denied important social/professional milestones. 

For example: 4 awesome years college, years back. went parties, made best friends still know today, built professional social relationships, made memories, killer graduation party... someone who's going college missed half experience. That's half memories, half parties, half networking opportunities, half friends made, half relationships... that's never coming back them. We'll get eventually, get moments back. can't really 21 college ever again. goes people missed prom -- that's someone who's NEVER going memory prom rest lives. They're going able tell kids prom day experience like --because experience.

In way I'm lucky got kind screwed career-wise (as almost everyone) longer term, catch eventually suppose -- least really miss lifetime milestones. imagine I'd bitter had, though. nice!  Seriously, screw people. 
My fianc√© help older parents stuff, they‚Äôre best health. super careful, since contact them. people age (30s) seem understand. stick hanging now. college admissions process radically altered. 

SATs ACTs required. Kids whose schools grade deflation disadvantage.

Apparently record increases applications, making colleges even competitive.

The financial strain families, affecting ability afford tuition. 

Not getting visit colleges person.

Missing final season sports, peak. Missing Senior Night.

Not many college coaches scouting athletes. 

No Homecoming, prom, awards banquets. 

High school seniors pretty tough. said back normal, course Palestinians get nothing Thank president Biden Vice President Harris J&amp;J world really needs. Outside countries, including many EU countries Pfizer Moderna logistical nightmare deliver. really hope, increased production Pfizer Moderna, ship J&amp;J Novavax shots countries.  I'm mentally drained college student. I'm expected continue taking full course load keep productivity attending Zoom University. 

Sitting front computer 12 hours day exhausting. Lectures, homework, projects, reading material, instructional videos online. makes want throw laptop wall sometimes. Digital burnout real. point ""risk hospitals overwhelmed gone"" means we've reached herd immunity mindset priorities aligned. We‚Äôre giving special moments lives safe lives others honestly don‚Äôt even to. vent we‚Äôd like it‚Äôs social constructs we‚Äôve taken away us opportunity take advantage of. Maybe try align ability compassionate situations others. FYI January 2021, household spent lot money get double tests different type well different labs positive, negative well antibody. Two separate doctors well county city observation testing well log system. cheap worth it. Los Angeles never socially distanced first place  Amazing! Life back normal even bothering mention fact Palestinians denied access Hans Kluge told Danish state broadcaster DR COVID-19 still prevalent 2021, manageable 2020.


Seems reasonable PSA dude another post abt long covid claiming long covid ‚Äúabout 45 symptoms‚Äù declined specify told people Google it.

I‚Äôm gonna go limb say he‚Äôs little suspect possibly hypochondriac. Federal mask mandate probably helping, assuming folks adhering nationally way community. Downplay more, please. think cured Gen Z's mental health problems Go right ahead, one going listen care say. parent myself, sooner mandates end, better. continue virus, think restrictions needed.

The headline sounds ridiculous, think stand chance eradicating like smallpox, think take quote, take global level, could kinda see it. think United Kingdom United States dropping restrictions Summer, think Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, others shortly follow get Summer maybe early Autumn, rest world, billions vaccines manufactured shipped? beginning next year sound right me. tested kids OH GAWD. 2 weeks, Florida handling exponential growth cases horrible super-spreader event? lot subconscious. could record see touch face infrequently think do; I've never tested myself.

Terrible. hope Canadian. Fair Mods deleted question second time.

I'm glad Israel well vaccinations. question include Palestinian area inside Israel, include Israel without Palestine?

Apparently hot button question mods I'm probably gonna banned.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well... that's whose dying.

If abandoned, death rate higher? never entire world throwing money resources cold flu. Nevermind fact ‚Äúthe cold‚Äù one dozens viruses flu mutates evades vaccines way easier covid does.

Covid history years. incivility politics üõ° Yeah still need plan ahead. US spent money Canada whole makes entire year single stimulus bill. assume nothing venting much are. However, instead focusing personal life-threatening position thanks many (not certain age either), choosing attempt possible given situation. bothers coming complaints ever here. allowed complain much next where? place air grievances sides your‚Äôs mine. I'm judging so, long judge others so. People cope recover trauma different ways respect other's choices. Yeah, refuted someone said ‚Äúcountry didn‚Äôt hard lockdown first normal year‚Äù isn‚Äôt true... didn‚Äôt eventually bit them.

At end day, I‚Äôm zerocovid anything, guy point. 

IF done huge true lockdown almost resistance, could normal year barring international travel. 

But didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs stuck it. Lockdowns won‚Äôt get rid point, gotta vaccinate many people possible. paying decisions March/April 2020 right awful lost year. Can‚Äôt wait mid 2021 better. Shit super immunity

I bet could beat SARS Nobody saying India providing Oxford vaccine many countries.. Yeah, lot places extra restrictions holidays let right new year's. think everyone suddenly started wearing masks avoiding people month 11 thing. Certainly enough people would correct assume restrictions suddenly working better ever better ever could hoped. true? US vaccinating [37,742,154 per day now? It‚Äôs absolutely true. It‚Äôs NYC. Yes lot may bounce back city offering none usually makes great. also supposed 2020.

No dropping bridesmaids (yet), besides maybe one stuck foreign country (obviously beyond control).

Some days feel positive trajectory everything, days I'm wreck. idea people life still uncomfortable past vaccinations summer leads believe life used gone. Trying host wedding enhances stress.

I would say ""I hope shit turns around quick!"" already is. still seem like enough :/ Nobody saying India probii Oxford vaccine many countries.. seen that, sure legally different. Morally definitely feels less bad prioritize underserved areas compared wealthiest areas, though know enough everything working know agree it. think done it? trick tuck top mask tightly glasses bridge nose. I'm beginning think rather able read articles can't read period. never made case zero undercounted covid deaths Florida - undercounted covid deaths everywhere. whatever reason seem think excess death disparity Florida noteworthy despite fact every state issue US 100K excess deaths unattributed covid. 


Now would alarming Florida particularly high per capita excess deaths despite low official covid deaths per capita count (28th). I'm sure relieved hear despite US total deaths 20% normal March 15 - January 30, Florida's deaths 17% normal. places Florida's excess death increase solid 37th place even lower official covid deaths per capita placement worldometer right now. go undercount conspiracy theories please stop replying irrelevant articles medical examiners rural areas. brother-in-law‚Äôs funeral service Tuesday. 38. wonder stance weeks cases supposedly reaching 300k/day. much flack Fauci gets, Osterholm pushes fear another level. hope people dismissive toward pointless concerns lives people around remember - guys looking locked too! Nobody (well, almost nobody) getting snatched past year. Whoever going end probably feeling way.

You truly plenty time. let friends' timelines make think happen you. think! Palestine Israeli military occupation settler colonialism decades, effect turning remains Palestinian territory apartheid state. stimulus package worth entire GDP single country planet named USA, China, Japan, Germany, UK, India, France. Think that. US spent one stimulus package entire country Canada makes year (1.6T). absolutely astronomical amount really US China could even afford. It‚Äôs surprising weren‚Äôt willing keep that. Especially considering money didn‚Äôt even actually go normal everyday people.  1500 cops requested. reported news ny. NYPD supplied hundred extra cops they‚Äôre still asking 1500. Um, no. Capitalism much develop vaccine. [Government intervention funded development That's United States high priority vaccine queue.

I'm free markets capitalism, half-truths falsehoods make look like nationalist idiot. me, may outlier. read online British audit checking Serum Institute confirm ship ‚Äúaz‚Äù vaccines UK EU AZ needed, doesn‚Äôt AZ already permission EU?

The production transport also need documented cleared, even though process approving vaccine itself. 

""Here come million vaccines!"" enough, need say ""here million vaccines produced facility x licensing vaccines (attached) transported company cold chain ensured technology z"". much simpler process vaccine approval, they'll still it. almost believe you.

It feels good true. hard believe shit end all. last year felt like 5. envy I'm excited future :) Yeah, optional things like concerts/movies/sports likely open sooner numbers down.

But expect retail groceries mandate masks vaccines fully available don‚Äôt want lose customers won‚Äôt trust un-vaxxed people wear mask. Sure calculus changes certain point, point 70%. become Hulk. I'm sorry downvoted. correct. number dead sufficient claim herd immunity reached. Fauci knows people listen point. presence waned outside sensationalist headlines (like this) TV appearances playing background people‚Äôs lives. Anything says capture goldfish attention span average middle American brief moment. changes says people aren‚Äôt paying attention literally say convenient average walking-talking-pile-of-bricks average American hear moment. Fauci annoying point. can‚Äôt stand dramatically changing predictions pessimism every damn day. Don‚Äôt bother making predictions dude. respect work, needs chill out. norm billions east. honestly need learn adapt west. need mandatory everyone, anyone feeling unwell wear mask public common courtesy. think highly overestimate number people actually isolated whole year. 

You're overthinking it. know death rate COVID. 500K dead there's pretty hard limit number cases. Getting actual herd immunity would require 2 3 million dead. Lol seriously. Osterholm negative nelly. dude positive we‚Äôre gonna taking body shots English breakfast tea strippers June Well got pretty good sushi delivered, nice today.

But even Biden said masks til Christmas, Fauci said masks still tho, came today said 2022, absorbed American public bodes real bad taking things *in* 22, so, that's nice.

Of course, since line communication WH clearly ""this whole year thing year"", people keep supressing calling fake news, means eventually Carnival-Prize-Waldorf-Muppet-Brought-To-Life Joesph Biden Jr eventually going say something like, ""Folks, American can, will, preserve year, *will* win Covid, together. year......."" 

And know exactly information, trigger, can't blocked subreddit's collective will, fun see people calling Biden fake news way they're Fauci week.

Unagi great, tho. Asking company make vaccine here, getting right manufacture thing.  God knows US needs most. can't rely competent leaders selfless compassionate citizens stop nightmare like Canada. Nerds. Sure. key point intending deliver much humans realistically change trajectory pandemic exception better medical care/research. virus part world. run course. vaccine accelerate herd immunity substantially though. Yes yes - right you. entire country vacation yet still pretty hunkered down. feel lot young adults. I'm 42 I've job -- definitely miss lot things, feel sad sometimes, lonely sometimes, even occasional despair. changes life still much less, even benefits, e.g. lot time wife kids, less commuting time, work flexibility. feel like weird passing episode life over.

For kids, esp nine year old, think devastating. age friends become especially important much socialization happens, suddenly becomes 10x harder friends socialize. Stuck screens time. see much frustration, sadness anxiety kids now, many blank stares, lack enthusiasm life. make playdate happen totally changes them, hard, especially winter. There's hybrid school many abundance caution closures quarantines, every time slightest sign sickness stay home waits til get test result, wind keeping kid home ""play safe"" etc. (largely want feel like ones put anyone risk, even though know risk kids school even teachers pretty low). 1-2 years life child really big deal. 

It really frustrating, someone else mentioned thanklessness it, especially since, said, we're largely protecting people really high risk based somewhat abstracted idea eventually spreading could spread someone vulnerable. get it, tough. places closing aren‚Äôt laundromats pizza places. It‚Äôs tourist bringers like big brand stores, along higher end restaurants places struggling since pandemic.  please stop pretending average age Covid deaths isn‚Äôt near life expectancy. course compare quality life years, absolutely would take prom, living life expectancy dying Covid ripe old age, suffering economic devastation rest life. 

Young people didn‚Äôt lose precious events, lost entire careers futures paying rest lives 50/50 chance dying older people destroyed lives protect.

I agree there‚Äôs lot complaining prom here, worst yet come. think that‚Äôs pretty reasonable expectation. want Americans able go lives hang people without constantly worrying virus, likely happen summer. believe significant degree normality June July Eyeglasses also splash guards. Eye doctor  Well, vaccines never 100% guaranteed prevent illness, think good chunk it. mRNA vaccines pretty stupendous rate prevention serious illness, great, everyone okay odds. Right also guaranteed prevent transmission others, fear infecting people care could part. 

I don‚Äôt know I‚Äôll behave vaccine. baby two young kids may get due long time, though, it‚Äôs different scenario someone look for. can‚Äôt wait things like see sister, eat restaurants, go hot springs, travel freely again. None things forbidden am, don‚Äôt think place feels safe yet. bombshell optimism coming here. pandemic eyes start 2022 it‚Äôll nothing memory US then. It‚Äôs early say that. Many places closed good. Many people left good. Many businesses moved good. real. may ugly monster also virtually unstoppable.

Not capitalism, human nature human spirit human survive, *live*. Well course, doesn‚Äôt- need build them. We‚Äôre getting vaccine months later US - world really melting down. end ‚Äòfuture-proofing‚Äô future disasters. could spend millions vaccine production lines met nuclear war next big crisis - people complain didn‚Äôt build enough nuclear shelters. Meanwhile, Philippines ravaged country Indonesia still received vaccine. Fucking incompetent politicians. 

Cases already started rising again. What's worse country moving ease lockdown protocols. Read op's comment... 10x deaths adjacent countries per 1M people. lockdown 2nd wave adhered better average American, though didn‚Äôt seem matter much. Different cultural norms though, different groups listen adhere different things. eye infection, cellulitis eye, kept filling pus. eyelid getting big pushing glasses face. could get doctors look it, trying find cornea damaged.

Could get fucking referral appointment get eye surgery. Nobody would fucking pick phone. eye exploded one night scar across eyelid eyelashes eye.

Best part? happened before, two years earlier, different eye: Also tried weeks get surgery Ontario, gave up, flew Florida done within hour arrival. 

I spend rest life telling people Canadian healthcare wait times **are** real problem. agree w u/Primary-Put-1702 Lockdown problem caused themselves. ‚ÄúE.g. country progressed much already vaccinating healthy 18-50yr olds, give still need vaccinate frontline healthcare workers.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt case US. state vaccination schedule. state barely handled front line health care workers 70+ folks. states may handling different way. country nowhere near vaccinating healthy 18-50 yr olds. complicated. wear public. Good lord. Well people seek therapy Like.... even basing on? anymore much. Even dems legislature trying take away emergency powers moral goal system seem match preferences general public. worried that...? call BS amount times touch face adjust mask crazy. Completely negates whatever benefit gained. Well flatten curve, one. I'm eager get pandemic wearing mask longer need to, we're cases exploded summer. lifted restrictions early initial shutdown never got virus level resurgence unlikely There‚Äôs nothing surprising though. lot people personally choose wear masks even pandemic over, especially winter seasons avoid catching flu people refuse vaccine danger two ways may extend whole cluster:

1) They, along countries world vaccinated immediately, provide breeding mutating ground virus. mutation bypasses vaccine fundamentally matter when, if, virus allowed reproduce indiscriminately.

2) endanger can't get vaccine, notably children, also others altered immune systems.

I'm hoping say true, seen models refer, easily believe we'll years. yeah, anyone coming idea anti maskers running get vaccinated. Pretty sure opposite. What‚Äôs difference Cuomo vaccine appointments eligible residents certain zip codes. speaking morally, legally. ball already rolling. Purely new admin mitigation measures day one.
Just like '08 crash. Obama dealt shitty hand ball already rolling. Mitigation day one.
It's notion change agent coming turn around company. ""I"" I'm responsible yesterday therebefore, future. hard considering many people US.... say like deserve award it. Bold assume that's 0 Something remains optimistic mask mandates go away summer, even Bay Area. sneeze cough sleeve carry handkerchief use necessary absent Pandemic status illness. good enough you, sir, want continue wish everyone even hall monitor already nowadays?  Sorry you‚Äôre going that. I‚Äôm postponed 2020, 2021 bride it‚Äôs shit hand. I‚Äôm bridal shower weeks don‚Äôt want worry people severely uncomfortable food drinks (aka dropping masks), it‚Äôs sad worrying basic things. Also worried one BMs drop vented people Weddit got downvoted oblivion fun Huh, Boomers photos florida bars?

Looked little younger me. someone also UK, care explain? sense anti-lockdown rhetoric. saying rules perfect they're reason think exaggerating. day already always No. Weather helps. Warmer weather's means people actually open windows eat outside. cases, weather bad makes appealing stay home family.

Granted without insurance I'd paying around $1500. Yes. True 50 year old teacher ""high risk"" yet still higher risk children, maybe good idea vaccinated opening well. Even would likely fine got covid. I'm absolutely sympathetic who've gotten sick died/lost loved ones. Also people work, food, money, home this, exception anti maskers conspiracy theorists.

I stand said. sympathy claim severely depressed traumatized missed prom like online school can't go bars. again, save someone actually needs it. Thanks sincere question.

It bit contentious. Early planned strategy clearly protect elderly, since assumed possibe stop spread. proven case almost Western World (US larger per capita spread Sweden). Notably neighbours Norway Finland much smaller spread, showing possible. 

It also said true original strategy protecting elderly failed, wide consensus Sweden. rest strategy Sweden blurry unclear. Herd immunity among younger people without vaccination discussed possible outcome early on, much known. Personally think agency charge national health (the called FHM) bit dishonest spring 2020 antibody testing media comments (not actual reports) always interpreted noisy data immunity-bullish way possible instead neutral. think closest thing behavior along lines say. chief medical officer always denied herd immunity strategy. early clear anyone general herd immunity would reached vaccines arrived not, eye kept direction.
 
The end result one year Sweden less strict (but still similar) measures Europe, slightly less casualties. much Nordic neighbours. Italy Belgium situation here. Schools younger children kept open, think quite clearly right decision. Masks used much, clearly wrong decision. 

A small, rich country like Sweden able better this. sure. like someone high decided illness spread fast possible everyone. tried screwed lot. That‚Äôs healthcare works. need symptoms reason run scans X-rays. don‚Äôt go scanning people looking problems. Insurance won‚Äôt cover chest X-ray someone who‚Äôs worried ‚Äúlung damage‚Äù. asymptomatic government paid extra vaccines Heath system digitized modern effective. weren‚Äôt wasting thousands doses every day could quickly reach potential people vaccinate via text, call, email  thats naive overly simplicated calculation, assumes homogenuous population everyone infects EXACTLY 4 people variation BioNtech/Pfizer protect SA variant? literally stopped wearing covid. eyesight barely impaired. fog masks worse without glasses.

We've seen repeatedly now, seems like there's tipping point covid cases fall cliff. dad's doctor he's seen 3 times close already - goes declaring covid death every day nothing weeks, hardly intermediate point. 

I really know explain it, unless people learning protect better things get really crazy. Whatever percentage agree due weather increased compliance. due compliance wouldnt dropping places like Florida weather improvement dropping NE. thing explains Nationwide drop level heard immunity taking effect preventing virus finding many viable hosts stops symptoms. don‚Äôt know stops infecting still non acute symptoms like strokes etc Oh wow. know that. Nice. B117 US two weeks though still seen huge case spike. Either people got quarantining properly, causing asymptomatic/mild cases getting noticed. guarantee large scale music festivals normal US south too. People forget open states months. PR driven, media driven. There's difference.

PR driven means media talks people get information context Covid vaccines, talk helpful folks paid agenda, portion agenda gets actual news stories. folks Pfizer's PR division drop useful context reporters.

It's media decided agenda vaccines nebulous nefarious reasons. news significantly cheaper easier generate republish garbage PR firms departments, Pfizer definitely spends money PR. anyone scared anything point want stay home, stays home, people get anything it. anti-lockdown folks calling for, changed. calling enforced demands ""allow"" people live lives, changed either. There's reversal here. comfortable ignoring science drink bleach, someone claims, would destroy virus, welcome, I'll stick scientific method, includes peer review scientific claims. adverse consequences charge.

You do.

You're completely misrepresenting person responding take anger them. looks awful lot like pre-prepared rant broad phenomenon looking excuse use it. comment complete hyperbole. 

Pointing EU‚Äôs massive failure important. else better don‚Äôt call out?

Showing results propaganda isn‚Äôt hyperbole, claiming hyperbole actually hyperbole. vaccine hesitant friend getting first shot moderna soon. know it‚Äôs significant still makes happy see anyone change heart earth get numbers? Depending numbers go by, e.g. WorldoMeters (23%), nowhere close 40%. You‚Äôre stupid think things missed partying Weird UK's gambles keep paying off. Anyone got idea might be? AZ vaccine looking effective Scotland, could game changer think it‚Äôs closer 55% rising fast tbh. literally 7 billion people needs vaccinated, many different variants disease. Sanofi give 1st doses vaccines western world probably, boy many ways relevant coming years. world random land mass Alaska Florida. people still vaccinated. We've done 70+ government keep saying, safe possibility overwhelming hospitals we've done 40+ AZ vaccine working well real world. Great see I'm saying police mask wearing, I'm saying fuel stigma helpful. cultural factors matter much. two Asian countries (Singapore Malaysia) study. others Western (Ok, South Africa, know category go). masks considered, agree, would probably happen quite bit even without mandates. 

Things like school closures pretty culture insensitive. school ordered closed, closed pretty much everywhere. bans gatherings (especially smallest category 10-100 people) may questionable. closing businesses also pretty straightforward countries working legal systems. (If corrupt 3rd world countries study, would probably work). 

Which category (of ones used study) think would show anything useful credit card data? non-essential businesses closed, even see anything credit card data people following stay-at-home order (or staying home even without order) using credit cards everything closed things outside home hiking something like that. rooting vaccine (I gladly take offered!), AZ's behaviour bit odd - priotitizing UK supply EU supply with, far know, good reason. like anything criticize AstraZeneca - efficacy distribution practices. Oxford vaccine going open source, help facilitate cheap equitable mass production. Gates Foundation ""convinced"" Oxford sell patent private company (AstraZeneca, close ties Gates Foundation) much less equitably distributed, [with non-European nations pay twice much added touch countries pay countries [trials took - good enough guinea pigs, good enough access vaccine.

This continuation Gates' destruction open access technology, used ravage tech, agriculture, medicine industries aggressive patent practices benefit private corporations. gets looking like ""good guy"" due ""philanthropy"" branding. remote schooling piece I'm still dealing with, absolutely draining point.

That‚Äôs vast international conspiracy you‚Äôre alleging main actors little motive engage one.

It *take* conspiracy this. media incredibly lazy (or overworked want think better them). PR firm work hands gift-wrapped story, they'll often publish without looking closely it. hit rate 100%, need launder story want via ""independent"" press.

I say A) knowing vaccines almost certainly safe, B) planning take either vaccine becomes available me, C) agreeing conspiracy. I'm providing context easy moneyed actors get point view across ostensibly independent news media.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Teachers states need it. Exactly. made comment I. Another thread people really think Serbia done twice well US preventing deaths? Malaysia really beaten 50x? report cases deaths properly. going keep falling. Deaths always lag cases, whenever cases go weeks later deaths go up, whenever cases go weeks later deaths go down. cases 70% peak. Americans lament 9/11 3000 lives lost, rightfully so. many somehow justify behavior live ""normal"" life amid half million dead throughout pandemic. see many people willing throw caution wind death sickness despite vaccines slowly rolling put end soon enough. year. long year that, grand scheme things, one year changing habits lifestyle bit save lives. Well, #8. keep mind high obesity rate, major comorbidity COVID. know believe anymore

South Africa rejecting Oxford AZ happened 2-3 weeks ago originally connected general efficacy variant efficacy. media talk back Oxford AZ good 65's. summary original trial data age groups well links published peer reviewed data Oxford AZ phase 3 trials effective even 75 age group. Dr John Campbell Feb 3 would upset Navarro speaking epidemiologist, upset someone involved economy taking economy.

But yes overall answer. Fauci seems like someone loves sound voice thjs poinr. US manufactures vaccines Canada ZERO vaccine manufacturing capacity wait EU give handout. great news Yea, hard. Get doses, deliver doses. Yes, *absolutely.* Poor people live better today wealthy past. normal mean? Yeah, students families going anywhere gatherings homes. Get grip. Depends part SoCal. beach cities would barely know anything different outside decent amount masking. travel ban speak didn‚Äôt happen way described tens thousands people coming regardless. Also increasingly examined foreign vector may fact Jesus Christ you‚Äôre hopeless. Look history. Look Spanish flu. shit happens ALWAYS. EVERY TIME. ended. Why? course did. always does. Every time. wrong everything? Nobody mistaken Canada's position pandemic. Canada has, rightfully, praised control spread (with notable exception Thanksgiving surge). Canada's government also being, rightfully, criticized haphazard poor vaccine rollout. absolutely still ""fix"" it, (to date) dropped ball pretty hard. 

Those two things exist simultaneously.  Sure, I‚Äôm pretty sure high income countries going walking around like normal end year. 

Probably not, restrictions still place outbreaks take trip place vaccines lagging may need required mask up

Lol no, unless also intend completely restrict travel commerce place vaccines lagging ~checkes notes~ everywhere everyone US even know pandemic end year.

Oh, they'll know.  prediction? massive wave cases entire pandemic said would? I'm confused honestly. deaths Iowa spike December 17th bit 2 weeks Thanksgiving right people generally start dying contracting covid. data linked litterially shows I'm right. high fuck something. 

As fake numbers yeah real states happened ""find"" covid deaths reported. Oops. Go check Oklahoma Florida numbers crazy amounts unaccounted Pneumonia deaths. probably fake eh? summary shit brains be. REGENERON (TM) grow new pair glasses, they'll twice hard lose before! think far simpler explanation raging pandemic \*just\* coming unimaginable highs last month-plus would like see restrictions lifted soon, we're yet. 


He gets absolutely blasted ways California. lifted ICU-based order weeks ago, left California (which 3x big right) pissed him. lockdown countries like South Korea Taiwan never banned household mixing instead relied ways reducing social contact methods far efficient.

I'm curious. S. Asia gotten completely control, unlike western countries. fact, one could easily claim western pandemic. Lol seriously accusing supporting one vaccine another, don‚Äôt - think great. Hardly misinformation mistake. reasons drugs hard bring market. reason protects people unforseen consequences untested drugs Simply using tax money payout negatively impacted vaccine scapegoats institutions whose job prevent thing puts burden taxpayers. settlements wouldnt make dent pharmas budgets anyways considering many actually found valid end settlements anyways. lobbied Reagan administration sold kind protection pharma companies would make vaccine deployments faster. could take one botched vaccination youve got near entire populations infected whatever negative outcome entails. Nevermind see 1.1 million. Yeah pretty normal Monday. would assume combination less data reporting weekend well places still limited supply need point make people work Sunday give ones get week. Unless right beginning like New Zealand. walled island even lower, take account many countries recorded fraction deaths.

Russia, example, half million excess deaths recorded fewer 100k covid deaths (the government admitted vast majority excess deaths covid). South Africa almost 150k, recorded 50k. Iran caught underestimating deaths two-thirds last year. Much Latin America twice many excess deaths compared official covid deaths.

I think end result US pretty average job, highly unfavourable demographics unique social political challenges taken account. living nightmare rest lives. Thanks insults. OP like Debbie Downer crack. Check post history - news good news takes entirely new meaning sad sack. February 18th, 2021, ""vaccines per 100 citizens"" measure, US sits 18 Canada 3.5. (Israel 85.)

Canada smaller population, sure, way behind getting citizens vaccinated.

Source: Science can't tell us rules put place. Science way learning natural world works- religion can't tell us ""Thou Shalt Not""

Science give us information relative impact risk rule. tell us that, example, seeing family give additional risk getting virus. tell us can't rule risk transmission even one people vaccinated, although earlier studies shown pushes chance transmission way down. 

What science cannot weigh relative costs/benefits slightly reduced virus transmission telling vaccinated people avoid seeing family friends, vs mental health benefits allowing it. That's value judgment. Unfortunately, public health authorities gone beyond science (saying know know relative risks) imposing value judgments (weighing benefits social contact risks)

You could take position life precious tolerate avoidable risk additional virus, zero risk death live lives facet. still drive, example, even though nonzero chance may accident hit someone car. think might seasonal boys hope so. I'm starting lose mind waiting state move later phases vaccinations. really draining. country I‚Äòm still fucking dying? Yo thanks. literally got done saying common sense something rely lieu scientific evidence. saying long expert provides common sense fine. 

If infectious disease doctors said small likely hood vaccinated people infectious given vaccine results would still wait ""peer review""? preventable death regardless. needs clear discussing they're talking ""normal"" terms border controls international travel. terms ability move act freely domestically. What? Whoever qualifies make appointment. There‚Äôs picking. everyone qualifies get right think he'll people relocating. 


But it, like changed systems. don‚Äôt known enough establish whether known don‚Äôt seem either. 2008, President George W. Bush awarded Fauci Presidential Medal Freedom, highest civilian award United States, work AIDS relief program Fauci contributed understanding HIV destroys body's defenses leading progression AIDS. outlined mechanisms induction HIV expression endogenous cytokines. Fauci worked develop strategies therapy immune reconstitution patients disease, well vaccine prevent HIV infection. current research concentrated identifying nature immunopathogenic mechanisms HIV infection scope body's immune responses HIV. Sure, I‚Äôm pretty sure high income countries going walking around like normal end year. take trip place vaccines lagging may need required mask up, variant circulation evaded vaccine, everyone US even know pandemic end year. studies this, results look good.

and completely ignored left collect byte dust online library. Politicians claim defeated pandemic, thanks people, write memory ugly times plant tree. crossover. least one current vaccines provides immunity old SARS. link huge comment. Well that‚Äôs easy say opportunity moments. didn‚Äôt. yes, outlook events different outlook never even getting chance experience things matter boring you. don‚Äôt really think you‚Äôre looking perspective own. top that, first family opportunities parents high school dropouts things like graduating big deal me.

Besides school related things, lost job. Twice. family low income went two month period receiving absolutely income. almost drop college first generation starved days money. Credit score declined ton tons debt. Finally received unemployment day thank god know it‚Äôs like non-educational hardships times. Things get back normal eventually milestones people missing on, never rescheduled, never come back. Ever. it‚Äôs okay upset things. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs okay make situation ‚ÄúThis group worse you. Stop complaining.‚Äù situation. People venting okay express sadness without someone replying comment trying undermine losses boost own. say ""get everyone vaccinated"" solution stop wearing masks. never get everyone vaccinated bunch reasons.

Let guess, read attached article. Let guess, lacking reading comprehension?

&amp;#x200B;

(spoiler alert: already know answer) Ok way assume. I‚Äôm glad someone like doesn‚Äôt like me. agree, said beginning. Nobody held accountable shit happened along way. Complete total incompetence way federal government state local governments. Yes, general society shortcomings too, proper leadership, could averted many deaths. seems reasonable USA firmly lock ""silver"" Nurgle Achievement Award, though, supposed best preparation pandemic world dismal results.

I think there's sort collective amnesia/revisionist history goes forums response been.

Like, seriously, imagine Trump closing borders January?  requiring American coming back abroad quaratine 2 weeks.

People would lost damn minds. People flipped shut inbound flights China. Fauci advocating that? Trump ignore advice that? doubt it, far even able conceive January.

And yeah, that, chances containing virus basically zero. vast majority deaths either March/April (before instituted preventative measures) November/December/January (long adopted masks/closed businesses/etc/etc.). what? young people missing milestones opportunities? vast majority people won‚Äòt die Covid? I‚Äôve seen less less caution since beginning. people taking seriously haven‚Äôt changed minds, people taking seriously burned staying home. Devils games still look same? I‚Äôm Alaska. both. Online boomer call number must saved boomer block cus know one got one immediately calling even tho online sparse. you‚Äôre public speaker need able speak properly. disagree.

If said, ‚Äúhey, queenemmathe1st makes comments don‚Äôt like Reddit. wonder it‚Äôs spent much time sniffing dad‚Äôs socks growing up‚Äù would think cool threw ‚ÄúI wonder‚Äù front?

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking questions‚Äù go defense someone called harboring conspiracy theories. 

Conspiracies conspiracies conspiracies. zero evidence, need call accept them. I‚Äôm saying OP bad malicious person. it‚Äôs conspiracy theory. fall victim times, call see them. spokeswoman Margaret Harris said wanted appeal people UK, telling ""you wait"", ensuring equitable global distribution ""clearly morally right thing do"". ... ""We're asking countries, got (high risk health care worker) groups, please ensure supply got access provided others,"" added. ... Sir Jeremy Farrar, member Government's Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies (Sage), also warned vaccinating ""a lot people countries, leaving virus unchecked large parts world, lead variants emerging"".

I British; kind sentiment common UK vaccine rollout really going? UK government people bite? Really odd see framing change real time ""there enough people vaccinated"" ""there many people vaccinated, area"". Victim one's success. also helps (wrt variants) we've found good real world evidence vaccines still effective variants, countries variants majority cases still falling cases, CDC modeling showing spike cases US result variants. spring probably case numbers similar late last summer, fewer deaths since vulnerable largely vaccinated.  :( new strain? That‚Äôs EVERY SINGLE VIRUS WORKS. them, history. We‚Äôll never away completely god actually prevent people dying permanent heart lung damage, move back normalcy enough people inoculated it. understand this?

Two weeks one year? Yeah people didn‚Äôt properly lock USA. actually locked two weeks‚Äîproperly‚Äîhundreds thousands people could saved. Shit, New Zealand right way they‚Äôre almost completely back normal.

Like, guess see people understanding emergency response organizations work, you‚Äôre lacking basic understanding really simple concepts.

I know ex president said it‚Äôd gone Easter last year he‚Äôs clearly even less informed are. Ah yes it‚Äôs conspiracy He's right. sugar coat it? We've atrocious response way. Let's lull mindset fine repeat disaster future. It‚Äôd great extrovert since normal times, lack commute would allow time freedom ability hang friends. Plus don‚Äôt like socializing coworkers anyway. time ability spend time people actually like socialize - hate that?

Work home ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù thing i‚Äôd like stay. I‚Äôm looking cases right they‚Äôre rising. worst case scenario   plateau.

the 7 day-average going least 4 days now....  Florida somehow escaped certain doom many predicted. hope learn exactly why. Maybe lockdowns strict mask enforcement make much difference, maybe Florida mitigating factor works well strict precautions, combined could even better? Something went ""right"" despite Florida governor everything ""wrong"", lets figure happened. it? Mondays usually low reporting Sunday's vaccinations. Last Monday 820K Monday 1.1 Million. Much much easier roll back restrictions put back on. promise, deliver. exactly feel. moved new city know anyone months pandemic started. pandemic destroyed ability meet people build life here. Trying date pointless. I've almost completely isolated year benefit, I've received essentially thanks anyone. (virtual) co-workers married kids actually enjoyed remote work spending time families get like all. I've pretty much lost last year 20s. think cultural political impact 9/11 would less fewer people died? Ok, really wasn‚Äôt long ago. aim lowest since pandemic started, period? Wishful thinking. end every single place virus spread achieves vaccination. yeah, but... statistics... bah, there's like 330 million Americans, cares hundred thousand old farts fat people, right?

Which option think best? ""working home greatest thing since sliced bread"" 

It's not. I've found really hard get situated new job never seen anyone there. people burned Zoom small talk socialization work gone. tend pretty negative things see happening guy. Umm paying attention news lately. CDC White House jumping back forth April, June, Fall. milestone targets, ""&lt;X number cases per day &lt;Y hospitalization capacity"". 

We're still dark ""plan"" one that's made along side public pressure.

That's bare minimum, ideal situation would several step plan. instance X cases per day means restaurant seating means mask mandate. Literally right next China...exactly. got original Wuhan strain. study shows a) teachers transmit virus teachers students b) transmission absolutely happens classroom everyone proper mask protocols physical distancing happen. guarantee conditions exist, schools open makes sense. fact, based CDCs recommendation open schools, 90% would qualify hybrid learning model. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating a) b) completely solvable ease. it‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs video saying masks don‚Äôt work. won‚Äôt found though it‚Äôs conveniently scrubbed internet. still making profit drug. sold right produce multiple companies provided companies produce vaccine cost. Maybe work.  basically real world data coming shows first vaccine dose much higher 50% efficacy Pfizer initially speculated? ever find good resource this? wish guy would shut already. he's wrong again, btw. Many nations many deaths per capita, nation top 2 far vaccine distribution. think it‚Äôs Muslim women feel Saudi. likely exit holiday season saw massive spike due mass gatherings let enough people get COVID virus finally running new hosts infect. Exactly!! 

My running theory people endless lockdown mentality usually miserable covid like lot people miserable want continue 

Anyway, you‚Äôre absolutely right . emergency , run cover stage long past . Mitigate risk, set boundaries, respect people resume life . There‚Äôs certain places choose go doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt allowed to.. it‚Äôs simple really rather lied told sunshine rainbows flow anus? Fauci acting like scientist cause that's is.

We done much better. trend looking good, yeah numbers definitely good yet. got used 300k cases 4k deaths day, nightmarish. cautious to. government media made general public shit past couple months. zero covid nutjobs left right centre. 

What hope happen come mid april deaths double digits, people start become annoyed push programme. Jesus, name feels five years old me. less year ago?! did? Why? Noted got it. Yeah, Brooklyn much better alive Manhattan summer. still is. Meanwhile US:

Infects covid vaccine take effect. I'm sorry- virtual hug. least there's outpour good news lately, think we're beginning end eventually redemption. never know opportunities await end tunnel. times I've even seen it, used aspirational slogan vaccines widespread, even realistic policy goal anyway. think people pushing LatinX ones offended everything literally trying change words essentially destroy Spanish language whole. least pushed back week :) I‚Äôm fuckin stoked football season fall. ready get nasty drunk pats game novel times. heard saucy rumour trying get Euros played England. fucking imagine, full stadiums us watching footy. Worth it!
*dies Japanese* COVID gain time last year season dependent? Also wave south last summer? Far stringent number deaths. Basically, Florida past year able live decent life risk dying bloke Leicester allowed meet someone indoors since April 2020. better ban Macron then!  No, awful. watched every event worked hard get canceled. course, problem forever, meantime, reach herd immunity vaccination, better everyone wear masks people vaccinated yet feel they've gotten short end stick seeing vaccinated people walking around without masks. submission linking huffpost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I could see Newsom Whitmer new media darling. Good you. financially stable could WFH, pretty horrible.  Let covid spread rampant reached mild level herd immunity lol Exactly. think you‚Äôre right voluntary aspect. Hopefully leads folks take extra care wash hands, mask up, etc. they‚Äôre sick flu something.  I'm hoping due vaccines us finally getting hellhole pandemic, gotta ask, much cold weather people going out? 

In PA example we've ton snow past weeks, follows there'd marked drop infections cuz everyone staying in? wish could suck huge dong winter pandemic let me. wrong explicit implicit arguments. lmao, rare get Covid, died. One think critically understand simple notion. Even point holds truth it, deaths reported judging excess deaths. still severe matter approach use undermine it.

Yes get that. That's point I'm trying say. point comparison show comparing two different points relevance other, fallacy. baseless argument stems denial. Different correlated...
Where r u getting ur information virus cannot replicate body vaccinated person? plenty cases people testing positive vaccine. Given takes days infection regular covid positive test, r people come contact large amount covid virus without body replicating it? US, die hospital Covid, family gets $417,000 medical bills! Ooof, problem lies get found out.

The EU went full locco UK open business summer whilst EU still trying convince citizens take jab propaganda backfired.... either US 10th per capita deaths worldwide. great, worst think means forced social distance, rather apply Nordic style personal space. i‚Äôm HS. fucking hate online school Yikes. testing everyone one arm based self-swab link instruction video, wonder false-negative rates would those. mistake Oxford made using single viral vector. vaccines need two doses reach high efficacy one vector first dose partially cancels second dose. used two separate vectors Sputnik V vaccine. Oxford vaccine combined J&amp;J vaccine second first dose that's unlikely happen.

Halving first dose greater spacing appears improve efficacy Oxford vaccine minimising cancelling effect. Vitamin definitely cold sucks much changed terms response virus. still national federal plan besides mask mandate federal spots. God forbid there‚Äôs another surge we‚Äôd looking response tactic we‚Äôve whole time aaah ok looking sub. smells like BS tbh  PA: 1521 new cases, keep dropping. don‚Äôt really see danger saying ‚Äúthe media seem hate vaccine, could cooperations profiting‚Äù though? 

It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs going make anyone less likely take vaccine. 

Yes it‚Äôs reach need look response climate change see rich corporations huge influence institutions like politics mass media. 

Are group hooded billionaires sitting room plotting bring AZ? No. it‚Äôs unreasonable think pharmaceutical companies might pay media positive portrayal (legitimately good) vaccine. Sun/vitamin lots study done it. bad USA masks etc really think possible USA would 15x deaths per capita India something science upward trajectory started September. holiday season going there? 99% fine.

Are sure this? dying equal fine. know ton people still regained full sense smell many months later, fortunately one know persistent breathing issues anything actually dangerous. Wow way measure percentage supply used - [oh West Virginia 3rd country 96.3% North Dakota 2nd 97.9% (and 103% days ago) British outcome. I'm sorry loss dude girl :( wonder we‚Äôll think strict lockdowns good idea hindsight. History often written victors may never get objective look, I‚Äôd interest see. really necessary disrupt lives young people ***very*** unlikely even end hospitalized this? seems like wasn‚Äôt well thought out. Oh wow. Shitty Unfortunate seems wild fluke incident. Yep. family member died Covid degenerative brain disease listed cause death. Alzheimer‚Äôs, otherwise young healthy expected live another 20 years. went healthy dead less 2 weeks. possible significant higher % people would appear ""burn out""? I've hearing/reading roughly 20-30% people infected. number factor 2X 3X? asymptomatic spread seems possible. tested positive lark August (PCR due job requirement) felt fine before, during, after. job NEVER would gotten tested.....that kinda opened eyes asymptomatic spread. never judge America goes Florida. notoriously craziest state country. ‚ÄúFlorida man‚Äù meme exists reason That‚Äôs 40K jump average...? What? divide everything two categories, ""Proof I'm right"" ""Proof people lying,"" fuck anybody even waste time listening you? Yeah don‚Äôt understand either Car drive must one safest way travel! think stay place problem!

A couple common sense thoughts:

1. virus, high chance natural immunity.
2. GF vaccinated, super unlikely spreader.
3. quarantine week traveling.
4. Limit stay less 5 days (mean incubation period), case get bug traveling.
5. **ONCE STOP WORRYING FUCKING ENJOY.** Canada could done preparations too. AZ designed allow poor countries produce vaccine. I‚Äôm sure Canada could managed.

Canada capability produce Pfizer Moderna vaccines current facilities. produce University labs feasible. labour laws Canada strict, cannot build factory within months, takes long time. construction vaccine lab funded last year March construction (mostly union rules) takes time expected start running Summer.  cyberpunk delayed again? end near conservative overly cautious timeline still good finally see government clear exit map. Problem is, good odds see Hancock's ugly face announcing goalpost movement due mutations whatever happens that. like first month okay maybe hope wow unprecedented times -- even sucks. abuse word privilege quite privileged able say miss time many people lost relatives jobs/life opportunities quite honestly stolen control all. fact people say miss lockdown proof no, impact everyone equally fact together news subreddit. H5n8 name Everyone rest world deserves good vaccine quickly possible. Sanofi vaccine isn‚Äôt going quick, needs better came before. it‚Äôs neither, better give development accelerate supply existing vaccine. think obvious. can't think could possibly lose glasses. Yes, air stopped glasses absolutely way getting around it. certainly agree that! talking friend Canada (I'm British) said like idea AZ vaccine. seems lot misinformation going around even propaganda, trust Moderna Pfizer AZ, apparent reason. wait something like 2009 swine flu outbreak happens again. panic smaller epidemics waaay worse 7 day average week Christmas 220k couple weeks 260k. call much spike, seems like pretty standard growth. Early November highest rate growth. Yes, small proportion AZ jabs given least 4 weeks ago, due jab got approval.

The actual sample 25k. Yeah definitely took one worst, quickest, paths figurative ""end"" pandemic. Countries like South Korea, Germany, etc dealing longer, considerably less deaths cases. similar boat UK, Italy, France, etc. Lol random name generator, regret now. link searched bird flu sub find One upsides living bf pandemic worry read it, I'm assuming conspiracy theories start happening front easier believe them. told would happen December 2019 people would say barking mad. OP claiming ridiculous restrictions place countries behind us vaccinations.

If someone link scientist saying exiting lockdown faster pace I'll happily stand corrected.

The motive irrelevant, approach either supported science isn't. Release quickly vaccine time take effect, virus outpaces vaccinations back lockdown kills even people businesses longer effective permanent It‚Äôs surviving heart attack, comes long term issues. Username checks Idk I'm sure there's alot people would let right think panic silly, kinda get it. COVID was/is super disruptive, see people anxious potential new disease.

I hope people read see isn‚Äôt next Covid. accepting vaccine 62% efficacy *guarantee not* stopping COVID? St. Petersburg quite famous place. refer ""russian city""? vaccine reaction compare Covid? lock down. enough people vaccinated, Covid never bad now. There's evidence vaccines partially reduce transmission know current vaccines greatly reduce risk severe Covid, causes high hospitalization rates. enough people get severe Covid symptoms, become like seasonal flu common cold. also wear masks like now. might optional recommended, required. Yes. knew back January Pfizer data first 2 weeks omitted. die. Might well live life fullest enjoy it, rather cowering corner like self righteous baby. I'd curious know late January better September-December terms seasonal spread. 

Yes, covid stays contagious less time warmer harder catch outdoors windows open, that's what's going last month. THANK YOU. mind like crazy since lockdown honestly haven‚Äôt seen anyone say I‚Äôm feeling thinking. kids aren‚Äôt even huge part plan, want know feel find right person want safely. Appreciate time thought that's gone comment.

I'm asking question New Zealand, living lives pandemic background, good get insight outside little bubble. mean imperative get 2nd dose 90-day mark?

No. There's 200% swing CI. Yeah sucks ancestors lived much harsher shit.

Probably accurate say died it. 

You're making weird, self-defeating argument. 

""My great-great grandpa lived era 2% died given year reason! stay home pause life all-cause mortality climb 0.8% 0.85% year!"" recall Oxford ones testing non symptomatic cases trials

Yeah, too. wonder they're testing non-symptomatic cases ongoing US trial, FDA requirement Covid trial programs AFAIK. It'll fun see results (soon). say that, instead making excuses. still 64,000 positive tests coming every day finished even vaccinating old risk people. We'll get soon. We're lot better spot month ago, we're still bad last summer's peak. patient bit longer, appear nearly end this. hell going Johnson Johnson Novavax Vaccine approvals? EUA submissions went start month news since then. What's taking FDA long, especially wait submission approval Pfizer Moderna long American population also relatively old obese, compared countries. factors causing people die aswell. Something take account looking death rates. difference one year make üòÜ Malaysia many asian countries done much, much better.

But tell think haven‚Äôt. enlightening. Check Zoe numbers, decline stopped started rise last week. know done better. least vaccinations going well. frustrating go two doctors intelligent reasonable give different opinions. sadly realistic. worse thane 90% others then. Got it. We're Covax project - that's UK! USA contributing lot EU chipping too! Well, let‚Äôs stop hiding homes, get back normal. Stop shaming public interaction... never get zero percent. It‚Äôs time move on. ""highly contagious"". sure ring bell. One person infect dozens matter minutes restrictions dropped. bad I'm going anyways possible end pandemic wave wise? see one wave infections vaccinated up? Problem opinion schools open Monday numbers rising

I‚Äòm last year school many social circle would literally able graduate don‚Äòt go back. One friends failed grade 12 left school. better another failure? Evaluating situation operating best practices protect population? returned freedom? Yeah dude, they‚Äôre opening movie theaters New York possibly next week. look literally place see signs things slowly returning normal people inoculated. I‚Äôve seen voting rights restored countless people. Criminal records expunged thanks decriminalization marijuana substances.

You completely fail see world around it‚Äôs disheartening. said needed therapy, wasn‚Äôt insult. honest. really warped concept reality. well, ocd anxiety issues never hand washing/germaphobe compulsive dude. hand hypochondriac, yeah I'm sure date accurate -- check version history, since initial filing Phase 3 need least 100ish symptomatic cases

Interim analysis done 72 cases primary endpoint 144 placebo arm 15,000 people think (couldn't verify that, whole trial 30,000)

The placebo arm 10,000 vaccine arm 20,000. feel exact way. virtual hug. 20-30% kind outdated, CDC estimated 25% end 2020. extrapolate known increase deaths since then, get 36% infected point.

We also lot people working home, hanging family friends, masking keeping distance go out. combination third country already it, people likely spread (those work person choose socialize) also likely already it, changes worked push R 1 cases fall. doesn't. That's entire point.

There's world Trump ordering blanket prohibition travel US Europe (and Canada Mexico, extent Canada Mexico enact similar prohibitions) January.

It's naive think otherwise.

To extent pre-existing pandemic playbook says strategy, would love see it. soon massive trade shows start moving Indianapolis Milwaukee, restrictions fall. current trends continue, think largely reopened July 4. also think Chicago survive another summer without tourist season Wrigleyville survive another season without Cubs. bad guess stay home want Major injuries Get antibody test. understand every state county different majority doctor offices readily available. scheduled one less 10 minutes, went day get blood drawn tested, found next day present antibodies system. Im meaning come rude proactive. real? said still wear masks, socially distance, see family even getting vaccinated. 

What difficult message people understand? proven beyond doubt country filled brim complete morons immediately start whatever message hear first, damned consequences. honestly, county distributing vaccine perfect time; holiday season surge beginning winter we're naturally socially distanced anyways cuz cold, wet, there's nothing do. think lot people recognize **one chance** really nail shit mass vaccination effort weather starts turning nice everyone country says ""fuck this"" literally everything pandemic masks distancing. 

If tells people soon get jabbed yeet masks sun get back partying perhaps data incorrect protection, country would fucked increasing prevalence disease Dr. Fauci would raked coals yet people like you. see absolutely nothing wrong continuing mask wearing relative distancing couple months even vaccinated, helps promote everyone else get shot end shit. actually slight chance effectively end pandemic summer time continue current path vaccinating many people possible.

We're home stretch thing understands need finish *through* finish line limp end cuz thought already won. Otherwise, life can‚Äôt go back normal mass vaccination, what‚Äôs point?

We're mass vaccination yet though, available certain select groups. think vaccinations open general public see high vaccination rates effect ~50% population vaccinated states feds begin discussing easing restrictions mandates cuz numbers pretty low across board minimal risk everyone. Thanks, must glossed part said ‚Äúlife return normal two three years‚Äù. Nice point out, mate. Take care this? basis. affects public health, input valued. 

He contradict every day. simply true. 

As believe top infectious disease expert country foreign nation different population infrastructure, don‚Äôt know tell can‚Äôt figure Oh yeah forgot that. suppose bar isn‚Äôt high. 

It‚Äôs also possible Fauci throws colloquialisms sound like one people, don‚Äôt know, prefer people speak properly you‚Äôre going quote headline try make sound dumb. could say Fauci, not. goes receive second one, talk person administering vaccine ask would possible hang around site afterward. 

At least county, people asked wait 15 minutes administration dose watch adverse side effects. Trained first responders epipens wait tent nearby. Could something worth looking into. What's saddest this.. ongoing ""yo-yo effect"".. (which see clearly Infection Death stats).. things loosen little, people behave care-free ways, long enough cause new activity-spikes.. leads us lock things again. 

The Atlantic podcast ""Social Distance"" great episode recently talked numerous aspects,. one 92 poorest countries vaccinated 2% populations.. directly creates ""hot zones"" mutations new strains easily develop (which get spread nations). 

We probably ever reach ""herd immunity"".. simply enough people going cooperate right things. likely eventual outcome various mutations strains Sars-COV2.. simply burn way population killing many people can. 

I think initially started back FEB 2020.. horseshoe'd random guess ""250,000 2.5million dead"".. we're currently 500,000. sure get 2.5million (in USA).. certainly possible depending mutations people's behavior. BoJo looks rough. straight lying? Schools closed, you‚Äòre allowed meet one person, kinds restaurants, entertainment, retail, etc. closed since November. hometown certain R-Value, can‚Äòt travel 15km it, etc., etc. exactly idea strict lockdown haha. Everywhere bro everywhere ... basis talk stimulus. stand that.

He also Contradicts every day. He‚Äôs disaster. 

Meghan McCain right about
One thing: Israel saying fully vaccinated, DONE covid mitigation. Israel fine health system. believe Fauci them? Huh? comments Pfizer? That's exactly why. people look headlines more, twist agenda. one seems point 2.8 million people die US every year average. agree 500k one virus alot death 2.8 million year tragedy family involved. But, grand scheme things, really many. 

What dont understand people honestly believe ""one death covid much"". Okay... obesity related deaths, cardiac related, literally preventable death? people asking continued lockdowns point also asking unhealthy food banned. logical. 

The people chock 500k deaths big deal looking statistical perspective. Like not, covid prove barely blip radar far world population goes time moves forward.  work covid unit. 95 percent cases seen, I‚Äôve seen nearly thousand, little symptoms. reason hospitalized live adult care facilities quarantine.

I‚Äôm delusional, brainwashed news. great news. hope ocugen shares fly soon. part traced back Italy does, however. Good point media. Unfortunately fell re-election year even thunderstorm would cause divisiveness political parties.

I'm freedom speech, damn, somehow need get leash US news least non-partisan shit.

I hope Texas get bind pronto. happen amid already stressful year unfortunate. One day signify trend. wear 5 masks bro - fauci five kids know age never paid attention pandemic. (They fine way) Yeah, makes sense compare immediate neighbors. see success surrounding countries wanted fewer people die could have. 

I really see point measuring success mainly comparison countries away poorly. here. Probably 100 second third hand stories now, couple elderly people long COVID I've heard of. probably rare. SoCal county restaurants open en masse since last shut never shut december. ignoring orders. number severity factors indicated study deaths vs baseline age extreme false equivalence assume groups compared life expectancy.

This part that's problem, it? many arguing people would've died sooner anyways pre-existing conditions totally forgotten people pre-existing conditions put us greater risk severe COVID actually human beings. reason can't give solid estimate even though doctors may give prognosis much time one might (I've never doc even though info available), always surprises had. People sometimes outlive even expected life expectancy. happens presumptions one may long people would've COVID that--presumptions may panned reality.  


But remember people fact people bet many family members wished could spend time vice versa. really sounds awful. consider ridiculously lucky essential worker safest possible way, pre-pandemic newborn (wasn't planning much either way). Besides gambling addiction 18 months lives

Wow, guys knew way rest world then... Slovakia (EU) - oficially worst country world deaths per milion people

At 1204 deaths per million, many countries worse Slovakia. necessarily, gradual reopening March, restrictions June. Beats places go hard get vaccines started. restrictions summer good thing, especially means Euros might played here. economy would boosted massively. Basically, someone department health apparently understand point estimate is, confidence interval is. told Handelsblatt journalist number without understanding number means. don‚Äôt mean say lied. Perhaps repeated mindlessly COVID denier talking point. Oh definitely. article attached dedicated struggles young people struggles young people shared comments. Doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else isn‚Äôt struggling well it‚Äôs okay highlight certain demographic, especially one overlooked lot times. Bay Area liberal SoCal region. Newsom typical San Francisco Democrat. resentment among people SoCal state leadership US senators typically Bay Area. He‚Äôs coastal Marin/SF Bay Area Elite. little interest/experience SoCal, California split least two separate regions animosity them. center population SoCal 5-7 hours driving distance SF/Sac. Fauci speaks public health issues purview. extent effects public health, opinion valuable. three months lockdown two months extreme lockdown aren‚Äòt enough, it. wave? rate going vaccines, winter ending weeks, likely won‚Äôt another huge wave. We're awkward moment objective urgency going down, still need sense urgency continue progress. officials got TV said ""At rate, we'll back normal April!"" half country would say screw go back normal now, put getting vaccinated, then... would take lot longer. welding people inside homes fool rest world lockdowns. 

China last country care citizens well-being economic standing country. golf one covid safe sports lmao understand referring to. user referring program terrible thing utilize Israel implemented it. Good Jewish. father's side family Jewish. make comment less wrong. former president and, according senior republican elected official, ""all republican party has"" ""the single important politician united states"" Everything unique... first house, first job first kid. Alot things come life. New York correctly. States releasing roadmaps, mean. aka ""Latin"". He's wrong.  Anyone else discover vitiligo pandemic? 

I‚Äôve seen anecdotal accounts people saying ‚Äúgot‚Äù vitiligo shortly recovering COVID. first noticed vitiligo around April/May.

To knowledge haven‚Äôt covid wouldn‚Äôt surprised asymptomatic case early on. Since vitiligo caused overactive immune system think there‚Äôs chance could triggered either fighting covid general stress early pandemic. course timing could coincidental know that. Im dont find surprising covid's risk gone down. work acquaintance mine died morning, likely due long term covid complications. hospitalized 30 days beginning mid-February last year. time doctors idea wrong him. never tested covid since new country time testing yet begin. Maybe something else, months later convinced early case since symptoms consistent covid. 

Dude shy turning 41 totally healthy catching whatever was. remember talking last summer told thought going die hospitalized felt like taken 10 years life. mostly time B.1.117 found [less 10% growing exponentially eventually take make containment harder Elite Athlete...here good heart prior 50 states different regulations. That's impossible. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs less deadly flu it‚Äôs big deal! Immediate death number counts‚Äù  **Clarifications Rantings**



There confusion posts, thinking I'm anti-restrictions whatever. Actually, I've getting sides.

The virus serious business. kills people. makes people sick long time. people lose sense smell/taste. people get sick all, *no idea* why. Yes, I'm ignoring age distribution stuff here, know people every age *can* get really sick. really want loss smell taste happen me. That's keeps motivated mask distance. think ignore danger virus, *at all*. 

Just decided distance follow rules, mean get make decision people too. Respect choices, even they're *terrible* choices. *so ignorant, purpose, spite me* there's nothing it. people chosen stop distancing they're vaccinated, that's fine, long respect people's choices.

The virus made lab. That's conspiracy theory garbage, know it. Even made lab, what? cares? you? humanity, ability fight virus, people who've lost loved one? Nothing spread hate. Give up. 

If think ""defending"" China, beyond help.

About - I'm ""anti-lockdown"" ""pro-lockdown"". US, think we've ""lockdown"", we've restrictions, minimal ones that. lockdown like NZ China, think we'd better place (fewer deaths). hand I'm *totally* convinced effective people think. encourage people ""follow rules"" guidelines whatever. Masking easy, yeah, suck, anymore. I'm ""pro-mask"" point. seem work, myriad reasons. Double masking dumb, idea comes good intentions. Experts [trying hardest, heck, trying EVERYTHING protect people deadly virus. really difficult you, I'm sorry. 

Please assume troll argue conservative subs I'm conservative. I'll get banned eventually. expect young people rebel sake rebelling. would expect question idea prolonged lockdowns healthiest solution society whole (beyond flattening curve). TL;DR: suspect started animals. suspect bats particular found samples we've taken. checked wet market there's evidence outbreak there, evidence started there. first known person gone there. 

It also could started frozen food? Somehow? find either.

We checked Wuhan Instituite Virology lab looks nice. take regular samples blood one it. said working it. thing they're working that's closest ready cultured yet. 

There 17 us working question that's came with. Same. Hadn‚Äôt used inhaler since childhood. Respiratory illness last Jan/Feb. Using albuterol weekly since then. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

In order answer question scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" vaccinated unvaccinated people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns deliberate exposure prevent us performing studies humans. reason vaccine trials took long, can't deliberately infect people see need hospitalization die. 

(EDIT: Well, looks like [spoke studies hamsters, results looked pretty bad. able spread it. hamsters greet touching noses like time. Humans really (do you?). similar studies monkeys results look really good.

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, would end worse hedge while. least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

That said, seem [saying I've Said saying. Saying Said?

**Additional Thoughts/Cool likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need mutation analogy:**

The spike protein coded 3,831 base pairs. mean?

Well, like lego sculpture 3,831 words instructions build it, writer super-detailed explaining motion piece.  

In analogy, immune system makes lego pieces (antibodies) attach pair exposed bumps lego sculpture. We'll say 40 pairs exposed example.

A variant instructions change one words. Sometimes photocopier instructions page gets tiny smudge. could really bad sometimes, especially critical word phrase, like ""left"" ""repeat six times"" description particularly detailed lego piece. Color might always matter, size would.

Out 3,831 words, many change much every one 40 spots longer there? probably lot.

But wait, many words change make whole sculpture really different, work sculpture anymore? Really many they're right spots, right? variants suck viruses; rare mistake would make instructions *better*.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? Could maybe [this US?]( vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel. 

Tips clarifying terms/language/understanding appreciated. miss something could help people? Please let know!

I see complaining strawman people actually advocating it. definitely happening- state announce reopening plan 2 5 regions advanced Phase 2 (25% capacity indoor activity, outdoor sports events) region set progress next stage week next (50% capacity blahblah).

This weekend, in-person errands, thrift shopping, saw friend, got slightly drunk ate trash food (outside) bar, first time since summer. definitely, *definitely* happening. Testing positive actually passing others completely different. virus get body test detects it. doesn‚Äôt replicate body spread it. late. absolutely useless. start BioNTech production study says addressed 'order' issue, eyeballing chart breakdowns sequence NPIs, seem follow relatively consistent pattern policies cite effective, policies put place earlier on.

How much behavior changing policies formally put place? stopped going bars/restaurants ban events happened... hell, already trying work home days could happened. 

I'm saying *bad* study (or ones like it), I'm saying likely huge limitations think cited basis argue merits policy changes point. Again, think need separate questions behavior spread, look policy behavior. much noise category (of ones used study) think would show anything useful credit card data? 

If wanted assess policy around indoor dining, first look role indoor dining spread looking policy change impact indoor dining. Things like location transaction data used look overall levels area going restaurants, versus overall levels cases/hospitalizations.  show credit card use restaurants fell massive amount prior imposing restrictions restaurants, may mean restaurant restrictions might bigger impact shown here, imposed earlier.

It actually unbelievable fucking nerve tut UK. I'm surprised speak head firmly arse. Weird, they're exact symptoms anxiety. Who'd thunk it? people complaining zero covid people zero covid people. true. welcoming, statement ""Japan Japanese"" Japanese.

It takes strong reason allow non-Japanese individual move permanently.

Kinda fair though, mean like real-estate limitless island. need roadmap like US didnt idk shut businesses, like Chicago, California, NYC entire service sector fall combined businesses fleeing areas top.

I think that's much fact US government's response keeping businesses people financially alive abysmal compared countries. instance, UK unemployment rate 4% last year risen 5%, US number skyrocketed 15% April companies fired workers way survive got little help government. 

The UK furlough scheme paid 80% furloughed worker's salaries, allowed companies keep workers payroll call back restrictions lifted (similar systems used countries Europe). US response pay unemployment benefits, meant guarantee companies would get old workers back (since attachment former employer, could leave, could go companies, could change field, etc.) reason cratering, lockdowns themselves. Meanwhile, places didn‚Äôt shut length time, Georgia, Texas, Florida, still service economy intact seeing influx businesses leaving areas shut down. 

Eerrr, currently higher unemployment rate (7.2%) US average (6.7%). unemployment jumped 13.7% May, pretty much elsewhere US. Georgia indeed done better (unemployment jump high lower national average now) that's one data point. really need show proper correlations (you showed absolutely zero data support claim) buy claim. can't pull narrative hat think people believe show data supporting it. 

So, finish. economic consequences NPI policies least much economic policies aimed mitigating policies themselves. something like 6 reasons allowed move Canada.

I'll blunt. Even Canadian pass points test. Cuomo should‚Äôve read room Murphy, Lamont, blue governors didn‚Äôt get behind October realized dumb stance take. occupied West Bank Gaza! people hospitalised severe infection. imagine long term implications hospitalised severe anything yeah exactly point. vaccine widely available cases community drop minimal levels need follow proper mask usage social distancing Well that‚Äôs absurd. broad ‚Äúeducators‚Äù term.

Is even English? 

Is guy really best scientifically literate spokesperson could find? wonder it‚Äôs bad.

Most countries? almost countries? saying. Israel already vaccinating hundreds thousands Palestinian workers.  Considering worrying mutation E484K mutation, happened many places independently shows Corona Virus may many advantageous mutation left effects transmissibility. hoping case maybe require 1 2 booster shots worse. say ' New Zealand, Australia, South Korea Singapore?'? 

a) old news

b) delay temporary 

c) production increased something I've seen US students argue countries they've studying (I've seen arguments cause problems). world degree racism, also true world see nationalism inherently linked racism way US (because history immigration lack native population). am, people generally would always act respectful towards anyone, native, foreign (visitor), immigrant, etc. However, would also absolutely support laws regardling language use school, subsidies films, music cultural projects support national identity, laws making difficult immigrate nationalise without blood, cultural political link country, preferential contracting towards national companies foreign companies speak language (shared culture/history), foreign 'embassies' promote culture language abroad (for emigrants, etc.). 

Ultimately, sort freedom association. Countries want promote sense self: identity, history, culture, language, worldview. put barriers kind prevent excessive outside influence upon these, lessen impact. country people might treat well, respectful, business you, they're obligation let foreigner country give way thinking acting parity own. way polite approachable strangers, choosy comes becoming intimate friends someone. Absolutely! Still amazing. get parents fiance vaccinated...  Masks already required every major airline US government mandates I'd guess trains too. we're vaccinating folks first passing extras. dangerous narrative certain countries media decided use AZ virus.

You certainly favors calling ‚Äúvirus‚Äù instead really is, vaccine. two different conclusions draw Florida/Leicester comparison:

a) restrictions nothing

b) without restrictions, deaths UK would even higher

There's data supporting b) a) Well, ya.  would certainly help. leave pockets keep circulating mutating. need translated please. coming home, lads Go look good news! like this: like month away gloom winter done. Everything better drinking beer park warm spring day. Also I'm sure lot mine also waited 'British one' amazing Satan ""class""y?

I find hilarious linked article provide explanation quote. almost presented like World Bank chief last one come realization. We, readers, need explanation, already know. think politics. Younger people significantly less likely crowd denies science decries anything like ""fake news."" weaponization COVID politics much effective older generations primed receive certain messages. distinct possibilities. r20s took place right devastating pandemic. 6 billion adults world, 2 dose regime would need 10 billion cover large chunk adult population. add production capacity per year vaccine producers making covid vaccines would get close to, even exceed number. think it‚Äôs money question rather time question. another country?!

Which country would be? 13%? Damn really amazing. idea high. UK Italy, Spain, US deaths per 100k cases per 100k British variant took spreads deadly. Right that, rates original strain going Winter. saying UK done well, havent. feel UK shouldn‚Äôt judged past 2 months. far know us government nothing developing Pfizer vaccine. research funded German government. mean ill will. opinion, huge number edge-case, truly worst case scenarios could develop anything. worth entertaining specific intervention a) likely way b) serious chance intervention would correct them. vaccines eliminating hospitalizations, deaths, severe cases every day (and effect increase rollout continues record pace get closer herd immunity), fact escape variant would take time develop, think worst case scenario likely materialize, that's a) me. Even did, think rolling back pseudo-lockdown would fix it. would hole always been: covid-zero possible; cannot wait without serious negative effects aspects life; would waiting on, what, new vaccine save us escape variant? mutated again, on? tenable; b) out.

That's risk calculation; respect others' might different, I'm concerned normalizing probably-ineffectual responses *tons* negative externalities probably-unlikely scenarios far ahead (*especially* actual end pandemic sight). There's good reason everything else. much faith people's ability admit wrong. 

Most people still refuse AZ people already dug in, people would rather win argument actually right.

Most people experience strong bias towards information hear first, takes lot work overcome first opinion took form it. long standing assumption life US 90% normal summer 2021. Maybe go house party can‚Äôt go packed concert. Reading article reinforces notion is, me, ‚Äúgood news‚Äù. Y'all prolly already know, expense sounding like ad... wanna recommend Norwegian formula hand cream Neutrogena. Fisherman use it. helps, somewhat. Can't really go full-body post-outing decontamination showers, though.

Ya know, honestly, worst thing learning suspicions correct. Many people really *don't* care basic public health measures. mean, Trump officials actively [lobbied giving funds facilitate vaccination, widely acknowledged administration [no plan vaccination distribution think qualifies good job.

That said, terrific job throwing money vaccine research getting scientists' way. saying ‚Äúthe developed world‚Äù quite conservative. measure antivax proportion people disagree vaccines safe, France antivax **entire** world, huge margin 7 percentage points second country ranking: least don‚Äôt many antivaxxers Spain, 80% people would take vaccine, despite EU disinformation. speed US going able vaccinate population going benefit countries well. June, latest, supply demand. Biden going slow production, going start shipping world. Leave Moyes Happy see UK roadmap, although find little cautious. I‚Äôm Scotland admit incredibly worried government steering us direction indefinite suppression. people stop panicking

People stop panicking. Emotional responses require validation many respects self-perpetuating. like thinking way cure depressed person simply tell ""cheer up.""

We're seeing play discussion variants, used Canada particular tighten restrictions, despite dropping cases.

The way pandemic ends realize we're mostly meaningless whatever effective measures exhibiting serious diminishing margins return.

And understand ""pandemic end"" mean zero covid. That's never happening anywhere lifetimes. Covid kill hundreds thousands day globally rest lives, even herd immunity vaccines. ends psychologically get fear.

We conquer fear reach serenity realize covid control, even vaccine. ""God grant serenity accept things cannot change, courage change things can, wisdom know difference"" Thanks. pretty bad anxiety, I‚Äôm thinking anxiety taking running (different issue I‚Äôm always fighting). appreciate insight! European commission everything source safe effective vaccines. There. Is. No. Proof. 

Alleging global media misinformation campaign critical public health messaging risky. tells people trust public health professionals motivated (someone else‚Äôs) profit. 

There reasons concerned skepticism around AZ. I‚Äôm doubting commenter‚Äôs motives. jump straight international media misinformation profit huge dangerous leap. 

Just something possible doesn‚Äôt mean presented true. feel like older millenials, people, able understand this. opportunities network grow personally without pandemic *still* can't catch economic breaks, shut major milestones. cannot imagine guys going through. must devastating. dropping say happy makes sub (mostly) filled *good* news days. Back world felt like spiraling control, used alternate doomscrolling desperately looking solace barren ""good news"" threads COVID Anxiety subreddit.

I remember trying calm saying ""one day subreddit full good news vaccine,"" really able bring believe it.

We ways go lot tragedy along way, wonderful couple months finding feeling hope again. though. said before, experts providing consistent metrics look order us begin moving towards normalcy I‚Äôm Welsh, I‚Äôll probably cursing slow unlocking November. overall point folks use information like study. trying actually settle type policies appropriate next outbreak like this, imho need drill desired behavior want assessing menu potential policy options. 

Again, saying study 'bad' people likely overstate findings *potential* efficacy measures. Look top comment here... basically saying closing schools highly effective lockdowns not. IMHO much evidence point way covid. First, think evidence spreads indicates well could kept schools open focused types restrictions. Second, importantly, ignores limited information available time. 'general' lockdowns 'general' (a) system overwhelmed (b) know relative risks certain activities specificity. 

In event, believe someone else could make credible argument dealt pandemic immediate 1 month lockdown, exclude schools outdoor events it. despite study suggests, think makes solid case wrong.

With benefit hindsight, course general lockdowns going appear overbroad... unless course started actually enforced it. otherwise healthy wife early 30s quite sick COVID last March. Almost exactly one year later, still episodes breathlessness extreme fatigue. Despite chest x-rays, ultrasounds, multitudes tests past year, doctors able pinpoint cause.

Our lives changed significantly health. still able work, anything involves extended physical exertion basically impossible. Sometimes stop 10 15 minutes middle something simple grocery shopping catch breath. Seeing person love struggling breathe agony.

This pandemic-restricted lifestyle deeply unpleasant, cannot wait return normal life, people disregard risk they're young sick lockdown. Prolly weather then. far 20 day thing, doesn‚Äôt matter. think cdc officially says done 3 (or maybe it‚Äôs 2) days official 21 day mark. probably wouldn‚Äôt push mush beyond that, crucial get exactly day 21.

As upper body muscle pain, it‚Äôs possible, likely unrelated related opinion. Fwiw moderna first dose almost 4 weeks ago chills later night still sure think vaccine caused them, cold, thinking made happen psychosomatically. Holy shit me?! goddamn situation! lied like year half! assholes want waste precious time fucking much?? Thank putting I've desperately feeling too; existential crisis sorts! Oh, lordy. shipments already minuscule. Greater Stockholm 2.3 million people getting 10k AZ per week right now. Sarcastic Farr's Law - ""What goes up, must come down.""?  comment sarcastic Remind July ü§£ someone literally going fertility clinic month trying conceive, let tell you, done, significantly less fun (for straight people, presumably. straight hence clinic) Yes, meet narrative, OP.

Sweden country bad people liked, therefore, must dislike default.  really stupid, hospitals get PPE Lowes sanding section. affirmatively said masks work. ""We know well cloth masks work"", ""masks work without proper fit"", even ""I really personally think work well, may better nothing all"". vaccine stop transmission enough achieve herd immunity. Vaccines meant stop people dying going hospital. stop pandemic AZ vaccine that. think quite countries reached milestone end July ones led populists. college student, ""fun"" feel like missing on. education, internships, lab work, research projects plus go find job, gone. us forced graduate little sub-par work experience compared someone graduated non-pandemic setting. 

Then classes terrible, professors care don't, unlucky enough get ones really rough time. obviously mention pay full year expensive tuition nothing show it, tuition pay resources (labs, libraries, gyms, job fairs, life seminars) either exist way grade used be.

Its year lost make important connections discover are, many us living back home necessarily bad everyone there's also reason students leave hometown college elsewhere. Yes, also must provide proof vaccination attend colleges summer camps. Proof vaccination also required many, many jobs jobs healthcare, corrections, education, social services, military, etc.  think issue one ""behavioral effect.""

From quote say: ""**We really don‚Äôt know real number is. think real range somewhere 70 90 percent. But, I‚Äôm going say 90 percent.**""

Let's say know 50% want get vaccinated, say 70% herd immunity. data comes learn 60% would take vaccine, let's say kept herd immunity figure 70%.

This would possibly behavioral effect people would look go ""Oh, that's much higher - probably skip vaccine hope people it,"" lot people thinking this, end falling way short 70% figure extending timeline virus.

So people willing take vaccine, need increase number give people incentive stick program, know quote X, practice actually _get_ X.

I think may he's doing, anyway - say exact number it, think permits latitude adjusting account behavioral reactions numbers.

**But, right**: example moving goalposts comes mixed-messaging... one might think ""herd immunity"" mathematical concept hit X percent vaccinated risk levels drop percent, he's changing around arbitrarily obscures message.  Well considering Canada around 30-40 million people US 300 million that‚Äôs surprising feel bad Canada, shit nearly utterly fucked U.S. It''s fucking bad guys.  kee changing it? Nah, week second shot I‚Äôll wear mask stores requiring them. it, comfortable cloth one that. sure. changes message literally every time speaks. admitted says thinks people need hear, necessarily based ‚ÄúWhen polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,‚Äù Dr. Fauci, took first dose Moderna‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, told Times. ‚ÄúThen, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‚ÄòI nudge bit,‚Äô went 80, ‚ÄúWe need humility here,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúWe really don‚Äôt know real number is. think real range somewhere 70 90 percent. But, I‚Äôm going say 90 percent.‚Äù

I get he's trying right thing. there's fine line fudging numbers little bit, propaganda lying. Australia here. started yesterday. Gottlieb expert trusted most, almost since day one. He‚Äôs one least alarmist generally optimistic experts even though connection Pfizer presents potential conflicts interest, also means privy information helps make statements making. 

It‚Äôs three weeks since Osterholm predicted Category 5 hurricane Meet Press. It‚Äôs two weeks since Super Bowl. According NYT, ‚Äúcases fallen 40 percent last two weeks 70 percent since January peak. Fewer people testing positive day point since late October‚Äù. Also according NYT, hospitalizations also 50 percent month. Even get hit ‚Äúhurricane‚Äù, hit large percentage vulnerable populations vaccinated, would presumably result far less deaths hospitalizations. 

I‚Äôve heard advanced adherence masking social distancing frequently credited would believe states like California, NY, Illinois much better results states like Florida, Arizona, Dakotas. That‚Äôs happening. decline universal. kind natural factor happening even though scientist expert, based upon everything seen looks like combination community immunity (I‚Äôve seen factors saying 40% U.S.) vaccinations. 

While experts like Osterholm continue predict Category 5 hurricane, really hope Gottlieb right head much brighter spring.  Required? Nope,fuck that.  I'd fine normalized enough someone chooses wear one made feel weird. I'd draw line though people choosing criticized though. say want trumps initial botched response, operation warp speed helped immensely. Tbf it‚Äôs 75k 330 million it‚Äôs like 75k 200 less million. husband travel nursing COVID ICU‚Äôs whole time. shocked snap chatted lunch break work day surgical mask N95. end sight! It‚Äôs weird, president said hoax would gone Spring 2020. feel valid reason poke fun. top official literally thought worldwide pandemic fake. much though. better worse, person‚Äôs perceived threat matrix different. society is, theory, average those. 

There growing push people across political spectrum for‚Äîif actual plan reopen‚Äîa spelled-out plan reopen, restrictions loosened, mandates dropped. opinion, isn‚Äôt much ask for. personally know it‚Äôs *really* works, though. situation dynamic. 

To say people antsy reopen, though, anti-maskers perceptive take situation. take time read lot people‚Äôs posts here, you‚Äôll find ton people followed every guideline far, get vaccinated ASAP, want live lives. You‚Äôve seen growing number people calling reopening they‚Äôll feel safer ever they‚Äôre vaccinated, rightfully so. be. disagree people calling reopening now? Yup. think they‚Äôre anti-maskers wanting to‚Äîone day (sooner rather later)‚Äînot wear masks? Hell no. That‚Äôs totally disingenuous way interpret wants. It‚Äôs even argument. It‚Äôs lazy thinking. 

The way see this. plenty people who, Covid started hitting, didn‚Äôt want shut down. people thought didn‚Äôt shut soon enough. states south middle country slowly adopted mask use this. states likely lose sooner others. You‚Äôll people will, get vaccinated, stop social distancing (the vaccination general population absolutely point see biggest drop social distancing mask usage, states actually drop mandates). come people wait state gives go ahead socially distance wear masks. And, course, people outraged mandates/measures lifted. Like, going shitton people. 

All occur people simply don‚Äôt feel threatened certain point. 

Here‚Äôs prediction: many people outraged mandates measures recommendations lifted upset anything closed all. mean metric fuck ton. 

In situations like people sit ‚Äúextreme‚Äù/far ends spectrums matrices ones whose feelings get hurt end unhappy one time another. anti-lockdown people turn. zero-Covid people next. 

There zero chance large portion sub mental mess restrictions lifted. Many people haven‚Äôt left homes months. Nothing appease people like perceived pure safety. like one mandate would sit right side. always always be. Lol troll. There‚Äôs way sane person would think this. MN would likely vaccinated ND work getting vaccine seems likely. still negotiated would ND policy role inform country state affairs, including news may like hear. Bad news important hear good news informs public. going doses they‚Äôre using? letting go waste? Covid-19 way serious threat public health. know views everything damn easier listen Fauci. said argument, wasn't. argument normal take time childish, entirely backed science. made strawman leap link government intervention COVID make sense.

But one sector healthcare workers (hospital staff) worked brink last year another layoffs economically insane morally bereft ask exhausted workers put OT furlough work regular hours.

Staffing hold vaccine rollout. contacting elderly persons, setting sites getting enough doses shipped administer persons plenty nurses ended laid reduced hours. stupid ask ones put year OT continue instead hiring ones mentally, physically emotionally exhausted. They're staffing hold up. back end locations. people wait 15-30 minutes after. stick 100 people ten minutes need space 100 wait getting jab. daughter lost junior year high school, senior year well.

Come back soon restaurants open. export ban place, forgot part. curiosity state? People die heart disease cancer every day years. mass casualty events? We‚Äôre sick hearing America. don‚Äôt care number 1 COVID deaths, number 1 vaccine roll outs. Learn sort shit out, elect competent officials actually run country. without yelling rest world trying put others down. It‚Äôs competition. Even decreasing numbers would imagine social distancing indoors remain even masks longer mandatory. Wow could beat virus June 2020 listened you. 

Thanks laugh.  older ones still received Pfizer. Pfizer AZ administered January, believe date we've used Pfizer AZ Exactly. Fauci advisor someone speaks public. speaking public himself. harm good cause. someone 82 -6 years life left? Gotta make averages make sense. source lack vaccine manufacturing well current administration. saying. doesn‚Äôt make sound bad US!!!!

/s Logistics? countries export ban vaccines lol 8-10 weeks max, longer that. tell that's state doing. Can't tell CDC specifically hand. believe fauci recommended something similar though something along lines Good decision explain every country Covid? going blame Trump too? Honestly, take brim push closed eyelid issue anymore. see weird?  

Granted home clean, washed hands go anywhere need too. I'm talking 30 minutes trip get groceries elderly parents. Last thing I'm touching eyeballs. find extremely hard believe someone ‚Äúgloated‚Äù death grandmother. think CDC recommending yet they? issue many using AZ cannot use MRNA vaccines 

What? agree Fauci never ""nudged"" numbers all, certainly said did, Fauci going responsible people get vaccinated. large, people going get vaccine never going would find whatever reason convenient support decision. Yep, lol.

I‚Äôm actually school librarian can‚Äôt really doors locked. Plus multiple entrances library. event school shooting think I‚Äôm screwed. thinking day weird going restrictions come months. restaurant year. parent's sister's house year. office year. pretty much seen person's face public without actively hating wearing mask, year.  

It's year compared many years normalcy, barely even remember like to, like, go work grab dinner coworker something. Go get coffee breakroom conversation someone there. Go friend's house game night. Even writing feels like kind dream woke from. Even vaccines=more immune getting many people possible vaccinated would surely important. vaccinated everyone immunity lasted 6 months would still break rampant infection cycle countries failed mange covid seeing. cdc said get vaccines you‚Äôre going end rich people rich nations hoarding many vaccines leaving masses date Trueee  I'm wearing one year. People come conclusions ditch mask *experts* balls make call. Almost science changes information becomes available. variant proof. Lab tests showed this. still provide good protection. reading comprehension needs work. solution stated. clearly stated New Zealand perpetual lock down. also say develop vaccine. Btw, vaccine cure. preventative. cure fixes ailment it. cure would hospital. vaccine good full symptoms dying hospital bed. 

New Zealand eradicated virus country. pops someone outside country brings in. 

How think virus spreads? Via contact person person. Prevent virus spreading, dies. Like New Zealand who, I'll say you, perpetual lockdown. 

The solution lockdown (and actually it) 3 4 weeks. strong restrictions maybe another month two straggling infections isolated. Get virus close zero. Rapid testing quarantining localized lockdowns case detected, like wack mole. done right, like New Zealand, whole process takes 3 months total. that's full lockdown entire time, start. could beat virus without vaccine June last year. people willing make personal sacrifices help others, ultimately helps themselves. many dots connect some. would help culture perpetuated daily Trump Republicans. case current result inevitable disaster. manmade disaster willful inaction ignorance part country's highest ranking influential political leaders. grant every request speak says something different literally every time talks. gives different dates, different guidance, different precautions. dates gives go future. February 2021 he's talking 2022. crystal ball really tell what's going happen next 10 months? future make obvious including conditions induced COVID count 3 serious conditions.

Because list includes pre-existing chronic conditions tells inaccurate story. make obvious conditions like Sepsis, Influenza Pneumonia, Respiratory Failure included ""3 serious conditions."" Maybe right, still pretty horrible way die. jobs work home. many professions it‚Äôs impossible. U.S. like [8th right death per capita. really ""not high"" you? fear here. seeing another person‚Äôs face important part communication. makes harder hear well everyday life. fogs glasses. virus truly dangerous people . wearing masks NEVER part regular life, be.  Israeli here. Wer'e still great place, start see normality horizon. Same... several churches area said they'll follow CDC/state guidelines gatherings hold regular in-person services they're lifted. Even they're truly enforceable, they're still chilling effect, seems like worthwhile trade-off. also creates open risk framework, seems like could field day litigously minded. inevitable. Name one country zero deaths (not counting tiny nations). Vaccines tested people recovered natural immunity either. regards long immunity lasts, need looking &amp; B cells. 

All virus antibodies decline infection dont get hit corona viruses part seasonal flu season every year.

Here good stuff Cell immunity effectively created antibodies 17 years later SARS-CoV-1 2003 fight SARS-CoV-2

SARS 17 years later protects SARS-COV-2 (AKA Im early 20s immunocompromised, quit work school locked room nearly year - doctor said anything else would big risk. pandemic ""sick"", immunocompromised literally never much affect life. Im hospital, normal weight, look sickly, overall normal dude. guess theres quite young people around boat, stronger restrictions health issues, lacking even kind life past year, living insurmountable fear dying young despite everything safe.

I can't express enough gracious people taking seriously. saving oldies refuse wear masks, saving people whole lives ahead everything like me.

That said; included country's stimulus age, college prices online now, despite much likely die virus country planning vaccinate everyone else - high risk priority group age.

So yeah, young people gotten fucked. Quick! Put glasses on!! Look what‚Äôs going Texas. many people physically financially able prepare didn‚Äôt. least food water. diverting resources away couldn‚Äôt prepare got hard hit preparing wouldn‚Äôt mattered. 

I‚Äôm talking sacrifices thing. People can‚Äôt live discomfort anymore. selfish part far people buying like mentioned. anyone understands must balance covid concerns and, know, concerns life? US role promote public health largely political role. Messaging really important. done poorly adversely effect public health response compliance citizenry battling pandemic. isn‚Äôt avoiding bad news making personally feel better. ad UK encouraging people get vaccine, one comedians said something along lines ‚ÄúThere microchip tracker vaccine that‚Äôs going track you, mobile phone great job already‚Äù UK? learning lockdowns worthless anyway. mom already is. pointing current government already tried everything said ""I want argue this, think could done more.""

what ""more""? 

we got contracts

we asked produce within canada, chose U.S. instead

even tried make one private producers within canada make one, one? would make decision months knew one would first, likely would now, conservatives would complaining wasted tax dollars.

so ""more""? Pfizer goes pretty good detail. numbers last 2 Weeks..... 70% HIT assumes vaccine blocks transmission begin with. said none that. did, made assumption.

So say shutdowns, mask mandates, time normal part good physical mental health. 

What childish argument. Here, let same:

""Operating small business good thing, therefore, there's reason government intervention businesses due Covid.""

Yes, look *only positives*, worldview makes sense.

We've made tens trillions economic sacrifices. insane think nurses can't sacrifice hours time get vaccines done. places masks illegal wear outside Halloween extreme cold. state's mask mandate clause specifically suspending **felony** charge wearing mask public.

When mask mandate ends may allowed continue wearing mask. would love award dont free award way buying one. holy Shit agree 100% this. Supposedly Ecuador ordered enough doses entire population. Given average age death, statistically many many people would died year anyway.  level immunity sufficient render infection completely asymptomatic though, even though vaccinated people technically get infected. truly asymptomatic (people never get symptoms) attack rate 1/10th symptomatic presymptomatic attack rate. cut R0 3.0 0.3 epidemic done.

I'm well aware muscosal immunity issue, I've posted medical references it, read one taken wrong message away totally misunderstood. know knocks transmission severity point. need masks point reduce R0 further.

Restrictions going drop summer everyone vaccinated wants vaccinated. virus going largely disappear US. Even people immunocompromised also generally increased risk since community spread eliminated outside hotspots. We're going fall back monitoring isolated restrictions cases imported (and lots yelling remaining dumbasses vaccinated get vaccinated).

Pandemic going done sometime summer, get emotionally used idea. stop arguing 2% idea ""we knoooooooow"" going literally proven happens. undermines entire credibility vaccine campaign helping obtusely stringent requiring 100% proof. Valneva, EU company, phase 1/2 inactivated whole 

there surely development. Hope highly effective safe! I‚Äôm sorry coworkers assholes. gently trying point you‚Äôre making pretty sweeping generalizations Canadians based negative experiences small group people. say coworkers made assumptions voted Trump must support current US healthcare system you‚Äôre American, previous comment refer entire nation 37 million people cruel, smug entitled. It‚Äôs bit contradictory, no? daughter high school senior year. lost junior year, college tours, entire year sports, missing senior year stuff well. already saying "" prom"" year well. Maybe spring sports. clubs. ""in"" class since middle last March. senior class photos. awards assemblies. Nothing. 

The younger generations paid older generations. fair all. come say this. Stop privatizing eliminating domestic manufacturing kind thing. trump vaccine thing. media doesn‚Äôt want pandemic end. Keeping people scared variants way keep audience engaged. Yet still people wear masks gather groups, cling ""covid hoax"" conspiracy. depressing hell. Thank want know end game is. far Australia immunizing everyone? goes back supply though - want tell people waiting falling one another trying get appointments get vaccinated wait bit longer send vaccine supplies another country?

The minimal effect delaying vaccine Americans, means loss life population. might save lives overall (assuming prioritizing gets Canada donation), trading American casualties Canadian. Uh buddy actually lovely long term boyfriend. happens graduates year, it‚Äôs last semester we‚Äôll campus together, means last semester undergrad together weird shell experience. 

I also enjoy socializing making strong friends. Boiling ‚Äúsleeping around you‚Äôre missing‚Äù pretty shitty dude. know someone like that. makes sense hold socializing immediately vaccinated, guy I‚Äôm talking still double masking shots now, said thing did. People like need psychological help, blunt. socialized medicine work definitely need to. even hit 50 percent vax plus natural immunity we‚Äôre gonna see cases hit wall This. can't make product hard complain able get it. Canada could pharma manufacturing plants assuming something else greater priority. Let them. It‚Äôs free Realestate afterwards. Maybe don‚Äôt like you. logical, opponents illogical. logical take continue vigilant everyone needs vaccine get one. completely open. patient, come sooner expect. Restrictions gradually eased point. Well buckled college excelled, graduated early able retire 40. think shortened college experience hurt all, I'd hazard guess took college like job may fare better later life. college experiences pale comparison rest life. Please explain. IMO that‚Äôs broad statement. South Africa halted vaccination AstraZeneca vaccine failed South African strain. Johnson Johnson one seems work going see people world taking multiple vaccines.

If looking getting people protected would giving recommending vaccines people confirmed natural immunity (like antibody test afterwards) America owe Canada anything? Like love Canada, go least one mini vacation year, really see ""owe"" anything. want second person said. know college supposed best years, real best years couple years you‚Äôre finally making money (fuck student loan debt tho) don‚Äôt study time. feel missing college years still, won‚Äôt lose everything next five years pretty damn awesome you! Keep head up, we‚Äôre gonna get this!

Edit: read comments feel like people trying invalidate you‚Äôre saying. hope don‚Äôt come way. 100% agree you‚Äôre missing out, I‚Äôm hoping add optimism show that‚Äôs it‚Äôs really like next 5-7 years awesome, 3-4 you‚Äôre college. Wow, sure made lot assumptions. First all, personal chance ending hospital covid pretty slim. allowed rejoin society might need hospital bed one day? I'm stopping taking vaccine, yet happy make personal health decisions me? Good plan. I‚Äôm sure, could always argue argument way later comes that. ‚Äú included inflammation heart muscle, scarring death heart tissue, restricted blood supply heart combinations three.‚Äù

Jesus Christ lose ability see universally. especially unhelpful stakeout take Old Man Jenkin's cosplaying haunted scarecrow burning farm insurance payments, nanosecond lose room fire since can't see fire die. 

And glasses always fall two feet infront us left never remember that. break stops reporting data, instead says thinks say order influence people's behavior. unfortunately think may opposite effect.

Like poll says 50% people willing take vaccine says need 60% reach herd immunity. guess thinks somehow speaking directly 10% people bubble going sway taking vaccine.

But not. fact says people still need remain locked down, socially distant, wear masks, can't travel, can't see family, can't reopen schools, etc. even vaccinations, people going ask get vaccinated first place.

The simplest way get people take vaccine tell get back normal. tell friends family it. Telling people wear masks another year right thing say. Ok now. opinion conditions must met order say beat covid? cases plummeting cares Yes, certainly hoping get position contact tracing possible, effectiveness vaccines may eliminate need completely deployed. India one largest manufactures vaccines, 0.63% India's population vaccinated.  Canada‚Äôs covid problems also self inflicted. Canadians denial. Masking Public normal natural. soon pandemic mask mandates lifted It‚Äôs two weeks Super Bowl Tampa. many people partying close proximity without masks, spike new cases FL numbers still trending downward. comment linking coronawiki.org automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Depends sick someone is. really encourage anyone sniffle stay home? Same! used fidget toy lost keep forgetting buy another one :/ means conspiracies

Proceeds spread conspiracy. Tanking states economy ""see easy gain control population"" big brain take. Fauci wrong here, that's shit messenger, nothing else. question brits here. worried South African varient? 

In German everyone freaking it. I‚Äôm there. Luckily parents getting second shots week. can‚Äôt wait see April go visit them. losing 18 months. truly unique part experience sleep around everyone mostly cool (that suck anyway, paying fortune awful housing also pretty unique). interest that, missing anything anyone else. do, sorry, still least 2.5 years that, that's plenty. Sepsis induced Covid. sepsis also one leading causes death nursing homes long Covid. Covid bring cases sepsis nursing homes? Probably not. percentage? say?

Covid induce pneumonia. pneumonia causes well occur someone already chronic lower respiratory disease. cause effect?

Meanwhile many conditions cannot induced covid diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc.

Why people certain medical conditions front line vaccine? greater risk. yet. Cases still higher summer. Yeah second this. life upward trajectory since graduating college.

I free time college, work. I'm reaping benefits. know, I'm Serbia haha say 10 million would one country haha Stop lying able fly. know you‚Äôre serious argument? lie.

It gives away getting dehumanizing anyone succumbed this, young old. 65 deaths 100,000. guess anyone older doesn‚Äôt count human being. Deaths hospitalizations plumetting along cases. seems local transmission suffocating. I‚Äôm sure mean. We‚Äôve 500k people die far. comment meant convey herd immunity would hopefully somewhat achieved via vaccine versus millions die, guess makes sense....thankfully. believe lot research university based government funded. Also might public funding organizations. believe sold private sector moved Europe. 

For example. lipid nano particle Pfizer vaccine developed Canada. think actually manufacture it. okay take away people's rights based personal health decision. We've never treated vaccinations much serious diseases like this, earth start now? I'm anti vax, want immediately take chances one. saying discrimination, okay. people vaccinated they're protected refarof whether covid not! Step One: facilities capable manufacturing millions millions vaccines. experience true, require type ID show residency (NOT citizenship!). anything - library card, utility bill, etc. it, give vaccine.

I sure varies widely location. higher risk demographic

This 100% me. I'm pretty fucking reckless comes life. still see large chunk last year thought killing one accident really fucked up. sub trolls post negative information. block them. know two people NYer here. Yet seems people knew careful going vacations Mexico, parties. I‚Äôm like close vaccines wait couple months. Please. close. Summer better. miss family haven‚Äôt seen year bit probably won‚Äôt another year reopen borders afford travel pay quarantine. 

500k heartbreaking. good article happened don‚Äôt produce poster correct, design building medical facilities time consuming expensive. aren‚Äôt four walls fan That's true. Pfizer, Moderna Novavax (+ variant booster Novavax) seem Vaccines meant stop people dying going hospital.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Bah dum chhhh! Uh huh there's sure lot reports people suffering pretty nasty side effects vaccine world, even people family's circle took it. Spending less year testing exactly through, yeah ignore couple reports side effects there's way couple. information, mean definitely fine. website paywall, allowed reddit without archived link.  Yeah definitely rough, get it. think things could lot normal think fall, things okay fall, definitely would second semester. I'm sure get normalcy college experience though!!! still time! ü§ç

Sure got college experience, feel pain different way well. I'm almost 27 losing time 20's/youth running fun, lemme tell lol. Especially single able meet anyone everyone around getting engaged, married, kids. I'm like lol okay fine. all. It‚Äôs 300 million people need vaccine first vulnerable. don‚Äôt even know children young teens vaccinated. 

The systems states rolled highly flawed reaching vulnerable discussed articles repeatedly. started August almost month case rates started upward trajectories didn‚Äôt really take mid October. somewhere Mid-January took complete nosedive, completely opposite saw last year March month massive case-growth. I‚Äôd expect different trajectories ‚Äúwhen holidays are‚Äù would agree. misread reply bit honest you. flat $10 bud light, late September, literally game sounds like heaven me. saw UK section part likely due increased testing variants (somewhere region 590k tests todays stats opposed 420k last week) , positive rate gone compared last week Oh personally like messaging style. wants buying constantly complain he's negative, indirect avoids speaking absolutes. whole time he's tough spot sure mean to, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù tier, least restrictive falls within false positive PCR range. 


I know many areas isn‚Äôt compliance anymore. Chico/Redding, areas near Sacramento, Orange County, San Diego outskirts, opened regardless. many elementary schools going back class youth playing sports people want normal weather warm Calendar moves Spring. certainly open interpretation given context times, ""social distancing"" US means stay away others much possible. US economy going function telling establishments limit capacity 50% was. That's stupid.

I'm advocate everything else said. saying thing year ago different context Well, really worse Biontech, going do, wait another six months? Better get AZ another Biontech shot nine months.

Nothing expire, they'll open AZ people. There's another 70 million waiting. would happened said masks important needed reserved hospitals months? 

What would happened suggested Defense Protection Act used make masks, thus solving problem? finally gotten germaphobia prior covid.

Needless say progress reversed. hands cracked bleeding washing constantly. No, that's myth all. impacted life way, everything done lower spread initiative. downvoted true, adherence definitely much worse last year, based roads around live never know lockdown last year post apocalyptically quiet. Vaccine question - got first dose Pfizer last Friday. 2 questions related. 1st there, scheduled 2nd appointment March 11, im math correctly 20 days first dose. issue? call try reschedule following day?

Also, initial reaction side effects except sore arm. last night though, muscular discomfort upper body (I lift something earlier day strained muscles). coincidence? slightly sore today too, I'd consider body aches. fever anything, wondering side effects days first dose UK invented manufactured vaccine (which effective 80s Pfizer despite lying granny fucker claimed) vaccinated 26% population. France failed come working vaccine far vaccinated 5%. Utterly pathetic. Trump specialist like Fauci, would long ago! saved 6 seconds knowledge ever put use to. good day CDC update 1m crashed car failed bar exam. Fucking long covid strikes again! also want overwhelm NHS (remember almost infections transmissible variant), said last week 60% hospitalisations 70s. finished vaccinating 70s. He‚Äôs moron. said still wear masks, socially distance, see family even getting vaccinated. Umm, what?

That‚Äôs idiotic, stupid, isn‚Äôt based facts/data. 

As soon vaccinated along family, resume normal life. 

Otherwise, life can‚Äôt go back normal mass vaccination, what‚Äôs point? prepared pandemic, prepared administration utilize preparation. Took astonishing 6 seconds Google it:

LatinX = person Latin American origin descent (used gender-neutral nonbinary alternative Latino Latina). Repost, given common virus inaccurate PCR tests are, surprised another instance thing. Honestly overpriced stadium beer sounds great right now.  Exactly!! many rumours SA variant AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine. apparently study saying 10% effective SA, shipped back doses India. know believe anymore.
I'm looking forward get AstraZeneca vaccine (which one country bought way)
Hope news fake effective SA variant. would take awfully long... Hey, instead mouthing like this, go check response guy left me. clearly explained point better, found argument convincing. to. 

Yellow tier: 1 case per 100k. That‚Äôs basically impossible large cities tier isn‚Äôt even fully open. It‚Äôs 25% stadiums Long term care facilities lowest daily infection rate since least May 2020, daily deaths following close behind. suggests vaccines already making difference elderly population. one best pieces news I've heard. Remember, ages 65+ account 80% deaths. vaccine trends continue, hitting low numbers soon.

That's fair point, thanks reply. many times changed mind masks? much facts, experience, data sure go, reach academic/financial advisor already. many schools pause scholarships return extenuating circumstances.... pretty extenuating circumstances! lol think western Virginia wouldn‚Äôt terribly upset get re-classified West Virginia. fair world good chunk vaccines would apportioned based fatalities per 100k population. places like Mexico Peru would prioritized Finland Japan. capitalism drives world economy raised standards living across globe since WW2. free market big pharma part of, means create &amp; buy cutting edge drug tech heart's content. Well would nice people remembered he‚Äôs scientist, experts often disagree. fauci says it‚Äôs gonna long time experts say it‚Äôs gonna sooner, there‚Äôs reason disagreeing fauci shouid considered ‚Äúanti science‚Äù situations, yes. expert using common sense say high certainty, cannot 9ossibly harm, probably, although certainly could good. makes sense recommend it. Note distinction common sense expert field, versus common sense ordinary lay-people. Guess Scotland game mainly single player Clearly government scientists disagree, hence they've developed plan. 

You're welcome stay inside wait till children vaccinated look forward getting absolutely slaughtered local beer garden getting economy moving üëç plan use covid tool bash Trump actually anything help country I'm sorry downvoted, totally right. China using build soft power erode US. thing makes US powerful soft power. many American citizens already think US isolationist nation things own, understand destroying system made US successful. XD Can't wait till Osterholm people become irrelevant next 2 months. let hate trump cloud facts. make difference. know many people beat into. There's store credit deaths.

This tool useful gov. obscuring numbers. believe FDA approved extracting doses Pfizer Moderna vials. vial supposed contain 5 doses they've found really extract say 6 7 vial. could delay reporting recent shipments ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Trump would people vaccinated one day Canada total? doesn‚Äôt seem right... didn‚Äôt even plan class '21 HS soon grad, empathize greatly. Waiting authoritarians give control power School started... Universities started much time expected complete enrollment submitting approval? Better under-promise over-deliver, previous form over-promising under-delivering. He‚Äôs wrong. state reimplement lockdowns mask mandates they‚Äôve revoked. People protected severe disease, whole reason we‚Äôve restrictions.

Now, CDC state governments might say ‚ÄúIt recommended people wear masks socially distance,‚Äù unenforceable. People going want restrictions we‚Äôve vaccinated. new Children‚Äôs Hospital Colorado clinic ask children teens smell four essential oils twice per day three months. 5-year-old identify eucalyptus?

You‚Äôre okay ratfuckery like that? consequences US losing soft power nations crying. concerns little control US going going forward things gone last decade. evenings May usually still great evening patio weather used highly critical Sweden able ramp testing first wave. still am. seeing Denmark tests much wasn‚Äôt able stop second wave don‚Äôt know much increased testing would‚Äôve helped played big part initially. users lose drugs anyone California think Newsom ditch tier based system numbers get better? People pissed leaving state. know 10 people relocated last year California, I'm originally here. damn well better address going happen again. necessarily far future. problems national response need fixed ASAP. Yet Larry won‚Äôt open schools back up. Horrible governance. I‚Äôm sure. heard one candidate ‚Äúhad plan‚Äù don‚Äôt see difference Good know weekly war room include deputy mayors, key agencies, key figures city hall, constantly determining going take move recovery forward. going jobs, good jobs gonna ensure southeast Queens communities around Queens bounce back pandemic leaves us, big way.

Finally, leader opposite side aisle talking pandemic leaving. feel like lot Democrats very, shy treat return normal life happening near future. think I've ever said this, there's first time everything suppose: Good job De Blasio.  happened way regardless president? Depends state relatives. nursing homes? unknown.

What describing called selfishness. everyone done early on, would minimal impact. Additionally, plenty people been, ""robbed golden years"" far longer period time trying mitigate spread keep overwhelming hospitals. 1 spring break series summer parties skipped long term effect ""man, wonder could done"". you, people, think 1 spring break summer would ""wasted golden years"" individual, must one people dwells single moment greatness past instead enjoying life.

Had people selfish shits ( young old alike) followed protocols, would come far sooner much lower impact everyone. Trying rationalize selfish individuals shows entitled people are, like : "" dare someone impact LIFE something impact ME!"". Guess what, there's thing called laws, rules, regulations, impact time exist reason, regardless whether agree impact personally. year long.

And year been. Initially, thought could last year, maybe two, fine. Wow, wrong. taken huge toll mentally. I've seen wife couple times period. severely risk, age 59, lost 40% lung capacity due childhood illness.

The times saw her, shouted outside 20-30 feet. isolated hours away friend son, lives attached in-law apartment, grocery manager exposed hundreds people every day refuse wear masks. Florida.

And got sick couple months back. Presumed COVID tested. cannot drive want put someone else risk drive test. Doc says likely COVID, changes nothing. live like past year, assuming wrong there's real choice that.

I cannot wait done. EU leaders must seething well UK gone getting many vaccinated crapping AZ vaccine. though really hit political levels. vaccine help people prevent deaths. politicise EU done bitter selfish Honestly, someone going post-college job search, universal acceptance American media (and even lockdown-skeptic subs) ""working home greatest thing since sliced bread"" really concerns me. Probably difficult part pandemic zero boundaries home life classes, definitely negative impact academic performance. I'm also really worried companies abuse wfh blur lines work employee's lives. Fuck yes. Vaccine tomorrow, time kick gyms reopen. Can't wait get gains back. another side issue, wealthy countries also paying vaccine research &amp; developments well expansion production capacity. 

I agree you, comes US soft power around world, remember wealthy countries gone lot trouble meddling governments keep countries poorer.   USA seems determined vaccinate citizens allowing single dose go elsewhere. understand reasoning, hope much Pfizer's recent statement comes true access shot April.

That's true. Since rejoining WHO, we're single largest donor developing world's vaccination efforts doses averaging $15/ea subsidize $7/ea they're charging developing countries. West Virginia less poor Man's Virginia get it. There's really nothing West Virginia cannot also find western Virginia.

Shows it‚Äôs working guess!  I'm curious far willing take argument.

What first set doses vaccine $10,000 each? could make argument. rich pay taxes funded vaccine research efforts payments would allow pharmaceutical companies invest production get doses faster. Germany talking now. I‚Äòm extremely angry government moment. (And no, completely fine restrictions. apparently capable re-opening, vaccinating, Informing anything structurally sound way, so....)  difficult lot people really contextualize numbers. making comparisons let's people sort meaning grasp. Right. question happens then? seriously living like 18 months?  That‚Äôs question need answer.  two kids.

Unique life experiences unique college life. so, sad. vaccines minimal use virus late hopefully research used create help stuff Bloomberg bit (0.2%) comes % Americans vaccinated one dose. says 13.1%, lower is.

Can't uplifting news involving America without shade, unfortunately. possible using convenient excuse either able afford simply wanting go? agree except don‚Äôt necessarily think it‚Äôs pro-science focus one subfield science (respiratory virus) exclusion economics, sociology, diseases, study education child development, social determinants health. accounts ‚Äòpro science‚Äô governors like Newsom failed keep perspective opinion. entirely valid point make.

Think Tuskegee experiment. think get mean. Basically people getting message vaccine may effective way would end restrictions people facing, feel essentially worth getting, may end avoiding it. amount people almost certainly this.

What feels like suggesting, though, attempt manipulate people. say because, speaking strictly based scientific studies, lot evidence indicate vaccine would reduce/stop spread enough safe go without mask. Now, personal level strongly suspect is, Fauci may well feel way, without studies seems prudent tell truth, know yet. agree going lead best result, feel anything else attempt manipulate public (and may well net good decision, would still manipulative). Governments probably already specific plans reopen, made public. specific timeframe date given, can't taken back. third lockdown; all. Thus, governments must absolutely sure pull trigger right time. There's point announcing 6 weeks out. backfire public officials something go wrong target date achieved. think likely notified one two weeks ahead tentative date officials decide safe reopen. wager guess, think planning end March easing restrictions. US vaccine producing country share.  Dr. Osterholm entered chat... think would unlikely 3 weeks shortage significant able convert second doses. legitimate strategy delay second doses anyway, even shortage, many consider still okay. like Canada masks last year. Looks like you‚Äôre finally getting deserts. mean? nurses incapable comprehending mRNA is?

Yikes. wasnt kidding. member everyone making fun us saying they'd hate third world america....peppridge farm members. we're 5% population fully vaccinated (if we're talking US). completely understand concerns close ""most people vaccinated"" yet. We're getting there, gonna happen faster thought would, we're yet currently. stress future. think i'd get vaccinated sometime March, got shot January. think i'd things i'm vaccine actually started realized *can* things feel okay.

I say give friends chance. know bummer easy year go ""oh, okay, never mind, let go party cause i'm bored this"". takes time change mindset. want ask know zero covid goal unless ask, also could change. said another comment try ask low risk things they're comfortable. Even fun going bar going vacation, times like hope get back eventually. went Trump's claim COVID real masks work, two things Fauci know lies. people really remember entire strategy ignore Covid's existence even getting people killed? less year ago! issues everyone except Johnson Johnson proving effective South African strain. funny Pfizer booster fall South African oddly quiet right strain. Things definitely need improve Maryland. I‚Äôm trying get neighbor, 76, diabetes, taking care husband dying cancer vaccine can‚Äôt get appointment. I‚Äôm 1c, parents 70, we‚Äôve luck check constantly. county giving 200 vaccines per day. frustrating.  Thank you, makes incredibly relieved. honestly find information anywhere. Pretty unethical people least likely negatively affected getting covid forced lockdowns/social distancing/... negatively affects people benefit it.

The people likely harmed getting covid ones taking biggest hit measures taken stop covid. 99.99% vaccine survival rate isn‚Äôt rate dying covid? Also, absolutely intention getting vaccine...don‚Äôt confuse anti-vax though...I‚Äôd go get MMR booster tomorrow needed...   vaccine better none all? 

False. 25% effective, people receive act like 100% effective, gonna bad time. don‚Äôt really understand goal making types comparisons Yay!

We 20 million Pfizer vaccines ordered. We'll manufacture 50M AZ vaccines, option purchase 50M Novavax. efficacy trial data Novavax, Australian approval process, slow long-term fall-back plan.

So AZ me. Dr Norman Swan (host popular podcast COVID Australia) puts it, ""The AZ vaccine turns COVID common cold.""

I'm pretty happy getting common cold feeling bit days, compared possibly intubated dying. always get BioNtech/Pfizer vaccine later privately. possible way India anywhere close herd immunity unless they've hidden couple hundred million cases.

And ton bodies. making predictions clickbait cable news station (which picked every clickbait station Fox) spokesperson Presidential administration. wasn‚Äôt soberly making prediction scientific journal. initial point was, fear getting topic you‚Äôd rather attack personally, Fauci‚Äôs interview public health response (particularly vaccine compliance) rather detriment. initially gave benefit doubt post. fully understand making ‚Äúpromises‚Äù ‚Äúabsolute statements‚Äù trained scientist PR guy. Covid Response Team need careful work PR IMO. That‚Äôs best explain case.

You grossly overestimated Canada's ability vaccinate worldwide pandemic Canada compete nations much stronger is. sure UK both, less.

Perhaps lupus much herd immunity India amount wrong take. quite sure start with. year center pandemic performing bad categories I‚Äôm happy America looking good again. seem forgetting Conservative government muzzling attacking scientists current healthcare systems use Canada (see Alberta Ontario suffering provincially currently). really great way encourage development investment sector IMHO. 

Oh also like attack public education. helpful developing scientifically based industries providing educated people operate grow them.

Our current leader best shit show inherited. Sure, like Canadians quite openly expressed schadenfreude USA's problems COVID-19 reddit past year, weird begin given Canada's struggles COVID compared many countries, including Korea. obviously ill contagious sickness, yes. Trump lost get it. think paid vaccines?

If free market prices wouldn‚Äôt anywhere near number enough vaccine give. That's shade. That's delusional misinformation. They're trying elicit emotional response, even got upvotes it, means people think way. That's large part issue. many people want confirm biases they'll believe literally anything potentially reinforce them. 

It's sad watch humans devolve real time. study concluding something 50% ~5% people test positive need hospitalization, unfortunately telling us nothing 95%. pissed Feds 30 years ago, yea surprise surprise, Conservatives selling shit blaming party power... know kinda like exact fucking thing seniors homes... almost like pattern Good luck stupid campaign, one falling fake caricature I‚Äôm joking bud. Sorry upset you. internet might place jokes hurt feelings. steadfast refusal political class define clear, immovable goalposts return-to-normal easily one biggest mistakes nearly every government world made pandemic. 

If want normal life back told nearly constantly leaders might never get that, eventually rebel take matters hands. Well said, exception OP really blame misleading title. verbatim quote linked news article's title, anyone blame, editor Bloomberg.  
 
Do perchance link draft study article? Bloomberg piece said posted Twitter, give link, found yet. ‚ÄúIf anything illegal immigrants first get it‚Äù Wow remember criticism Fauci would get eviscerated comment would eventually deleted mod. Yeah 6 years pretty decent amount time fix problems. Yeah someone else started it. what? No, Trump bought. bought even more. People criticized buying many doses. You‚Äôre upset planned ahead better Canada. believe 10 years, desirable people consistently ""socially shamed"" wearing face covering public place building 24/7? 


Big hospitalization drop today. -3.5% yesterday, compared -3.3% previous Sunday. small blip last week couple days hospitalizations dropped lower rate previous week, appears snowstorm related (Texas hospitals reporting unable discharge patients nowhere go). 


At current weekly rate hospitalization change, US would reach lowest hospital census pandemic exactly 4 weeks, March 21. 


The declines case totals consistent R(t) United States 0.8. apply recent estimate true daily infections US, country would reach lowest COVID prevalence entire pandemic approximately 14 days. 


As popular commenter Craig notes comments Covid Tracking post, death rate hospitals also appears dropping. Hospitals longer overwhelmed, think likely we're seeing effect monoclonal antibody treatments. hospitalizations drop, higher-percentage patients receive highly effective treatments. even make sense. He'd get shit hard. 


Hell people shitting hitting 100 million. Depressing? Seriously? say, ‚Äú know might annoying, it‚Äôs help keep you, family, friends‚Äô families, staff families safe.‚Äù

It‚Äôs death warrant, staff vaccinated, masks won‚Äôt needed Fair point. put plainly I‚Äôd prefer say thinks. Instead conversations like changes approach based believes public ‚Äúneeds‚Äù hear almost daily basis. Nuke Canada! can't speak every vaccination site - I'm teacher California went get vaccinated super-site county opened appointments teachers. brought W-2, timecards, school ID etc show fit category, asked see driver's license confirm person who's name appointment. could person street job; seemed like relying honor system, knows... ‚ÄúBut USA sucks hate American fuck America‚Äù - every ungrateful 20 something Reddit more, merrier.

There's people want excuse bury heads get back normal. could end less severe mentalities gotten bad drag long time (Fauci sais possibly wearing masks 2022).

I'm sorry losing years , completely understand feels. I'm Canadian , can't really relate college experience since Canada much subdued since universities commuter schools therefore students live campus. said, pandemic robbed us massive part youth never get back.

Good luck campaign. think wasting time trying bully broke millennials spending money whatever you‚Äôre invested in. Canadian, see everything getting track shortly. bad weeks, everything looking great now. We're gonna catch goals Q1, Q2 numbers look excellent. tested positive covid December 7th. Got vaccinated Jan 13th. 2nd dose Feb 3rd. like paying tax turned lowest taxation Americans would ever have. Habeas Corpus signalling eventual end slavery help either. Sane people also get excited make fun people something innocuous like wearing mask. recent comment called American people rise sort violent revolution, I'm one clue.. ever accident illegal alien car insurance even driver's license fault? sucks. even arrest dude California. Guess ended paying higher insurance premiums? opening link browser window that‚Äôs set private mode works 99% time iOS devices real issue.

I hope Germany takes long hard look deaths economic damage resulting EU procurement, votes accordingly (ie. AfD, exit referendum). sure. guess cases low don‚Äôt worry next surge overwhelm hospitals. getting Chile safer? I've read Chile great job vaccinating population. rich countries ordered vaccines 2-3 times actually need. example US orders 1.2 Billion doses (while needing \~660 million) UK ordered 417 million (while needing \~130 million).

So excess either sold donated poorer countries. talking couple billion doses total. Vaccines cars planes though. US boarding vaccines either. producing adequate supply current demand. 

It perfectly natural vaccine producing country provide citizens sending surplus overseas. hoarding either. same! downward trend? see upward turns infecting autoimmune deficient people best way (i dont link, find it). suspect thats many mutations occur. certainly don‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôd surprised 60%+ students actually vaccinated. Every suburban progressive millennial mom anti-vaxxer. send kids public school unvaccinated. telling fucking actual truth lying all? one trusts CDC. told us masks work buy them. told us absolutely need them.  tell fucking truth. Ok... else thought, ""there must way less people Canada ever thought possible USA vaccinating equivalent thier entire population daily!""

Just me?

Ok. lot people saying don‚Äôt feel comfortable social all, using Covid excuse Yes, common someone sick cold (not really sick) even public transportation. I'm saying everyone wearing masks time, stigma around masks. fact, sniffle someone HAND MASK. make fun like guy eager do. so. combination size exclusion, electrostatic attraction, surface adsorption, readily available kn95/kf94 masks reduce load size inhaled virus particles carriers. know lot 9 months ago. tests done NIOSH labs give us real reason wearing mask protection. agenda. grew lived many years. Imagine started soon could have... country hadn‚Äôt run fucking maniac. keep seeing articles thinking I‚Äôm behind getting vaccine realize I‚Äôm eligible. entire family healthcare I‚Äôm one currently unvaccinated now. think fines like would extremely effective getting Covid positive people suddenly ‚Äúforget‚Äù people contact with. Contact tracing would become much harder. chance. lied to. maybe read second sentence wrote responding first? specifically said US gets cranking vaccines. Even serious students dont usually get retire 40, buddy. well got lucky too. norm though.

I definately second main point every moment life unique however. really college unique time. happen once. say 37,000,000 people smug cruel, Canadians posted reddit expressing schadenfreude regarding USA's struggles coronavirus, well Canadian coworkers. Though number large, definitely 37,000,000 people, ever said was. 

If someone says, ""Million Americans voted Trump,"" that's indisputable fact. mean voted Trump. Nonetheless, millions Americans fact vote Donald Trump. Likewise, lot Canadians expressed schadenfreude regarding USA's struggles coronavirus. fact. mean Wayne Gretzky did. doubt Mr. Gretzky feels way he's among many Canadians posted sentiments reddit. fact remains lot Canadians reddit real life gloated Americans suffering COVID-19. fact whether like (which apparently, don't) like (which don't). I'm 32 nearly ten years since graduation, would unequivocally say four years college four best years life far, significant margin. time adult life constantly surrounded friends same-age peers, us similarly unburdened responsibilities adults college like full-time work raising kids. bunch friends living within walking distance, sharing unique fun experiences together regularly. adventures, parties, intramural sports, interesting classes, impromptu late night urban exploration, special knew time savored it. would devastated lose it, really feel students college years interrupted pandemic. See, that‚Äôs thing, you‚Äôre talking new virus deadly, tend prioritize life death aspect mitigating spread. that, want who? experienced expert epidemiologist. (ooh three eee‚Äôs!) 

So, no, ‚Äúanyone‚Äù way described. Although decisions suggestions made person would take account, position save lives first. 

Unfortunately, crisis horrid, sacrifices necessary. sacrifices worse death life itself. importantly, permanent- though surely feels like times. agenda showing  not. FTA: everything goes according plan, much California could come close herd immunity levels vaccination late summer.
....
The vaccines hand powerfully good preventing severe illness, even variants appear somewhat resistant, retooled match virus mutates. Vaccines almost certainly reduce hospitalizations deaths COVID-19, could make pandemic much tolerable coming months, long it‚Äôs technically over. left EU like Great Britain, done July. point originally can‚Äôt blame Trudeau blaming government also nothing. conservatives originally sold start problem.

Blaming Trudeau without acknowledging conservatives role playing red vs blue. think talking That's article talking about. article talking new data. study article talking yet blatantly misrepresenting study actually said**

Is silly since OP literally used article's headline. want blame anyone article misleading (which also silly since talking different study), blame Bloomberg, OP. still year go. restrictions already lasted much longer needed, evidenced fact open Florida much worse heavily locked California (why California‚Äôs restrictions basically lasted nearly year?), it‚Äôs hard see situation continuing indefinitely. really think even though know better treat it, vaccines available population, cases declining faster rose, worst yet come?   agree. Summer likely goal. they‚Äôre ‚Äúunder promise deliver‚Äù train much possible. Further, end May that‚Äôs 400 million doses / 200 million people vaccinated. Almost adult vectors transmission could eliminated. Memorial Day barbecues? Hell yes. 

Setting numerical goals one thing. Promising pandemic gone certain date last administration did. global distribution prioritised them. countried touched got firsts. That's medical staff told me. Bullshit. vaccines incoming. new Pfizer order arrive Q4-Q1, EU failed secure early Novavax Curevac doses, Moderna interested delivering EU underpaid. made claim December 8th vaccines even approved. So, look suspected reinfections. Part reason low little genetic sequencing done much pandemic. considered true reinfection, need prove virus 1st infection genetically extremely similar virus second infection. Without genetic sequencing done cases, becomes impossible hit criteria, confirmed reinfections remain low, especially US little genetic sequencing save samples.

Many sources disagree rates, acknowledge higher confirmed reinfections.

Here's one puts 83% protected reinfection past infections junior year high school 3 way tie valedictorian.

My school punitive finals, meaning finals affected grade meet 3 certain requirements: 1. B higher grade class leading final, 2. discipline reports less 2 detentions semester, 3. 3 excused absences 1 unexcused absence semester.

I type 1 diabetic got strep teammate basketball team showed sick prevent hitting 3 days absences. must gotten water bottle mixed sick week half.

I straight discipline reposts/detentions, 5 AP courses.

I asked exemption based medical background told kids made sick fine would unfair them.

I took 7 finals 1.5 days. trig exam scored second highest school history, 65%, highest 68% guy teaches nuke engineering ivy league school. GPA dropped full point mathematically eliminated valedictorian honors 5k scholarship came it.

Fuck anyone perpetuates ignorant ass policy, sick people focus getting well getting back work. again, maybe public health expert‚Äôs opinions valued cranks Reddit took handful biology classes mediocre state school point user called argument bananas proceeding agree it. said, factories aren‚Äôt easy build year. work around treating biotech sector critical national security, Canada already aerospace shipbuilding, investing existing industry generally‚Äînot pandemic. think disagree less think age group way disproportionately seen ""front lines"" well, yet totally f----- vaccine priority system

Its totally fucked doubly whammy. ""Hey know people crushed livelihood protect? get vaccine first"" Poverty always affected people color severely even though damaging itself. negative effect. Keep telling people need wear mask another year we're already year people gonna give up. said december 8th.  amazes incredulous people science...while posting computers powered electricity using radio stable civilization partially enabled widespread vaccination...

Seriously. Scientific method works works well. Humans REALLY good innovating solving problems (unfortunately, tend wait to) - damnit, MAKES US HUMAN. 

&amp;#x200B;

Our ability harness fire, domesticate animals, build tools, farm, form societies makes us unique special creature know that. PROUD. also learn experience and, know, keep investing solutions. capable. ton workers refused vaccine? I‚Äôm you, think disappointed. Even hit numbers, seems certain we‚Äôre still going cautioned wear masks &amp; keep reasonable social distance (meaning maybe sitting shoulder shoulder indoor rock concert. I‚Äôm referring hanging w friends/family). 

If life get *mostly* back normal, wearing mask, I‚Äôll take thrilled. I'm fine giving Canada supply longer issue US, case. vaccines spare right Americans still struggling get vacciated.

I really think peaceful boarder Canada means owe anything, that's like told owe $20 punching face. That's standard expectation, something owe someone for.

I disgree tariffs general think Trump tariffs repealed think want appologize tariffs, repeal tariffs. nothing vaccines. need stop sucking dude's dick. He's shitty person face corona fight. He's soundbyte disaster. Canadian pissed Americas used privilege take vaccines less fortunate countries. distributed equally potentially stop mutations. Kind like net stop lot holes doesn‚Äôt work well. lots poor countries getting anything people might die long run giving virus opportunity mutate. strongly recommended distribute equally. insurance, needs check box give proper documentation  Well, I'm trying say sounds like earlier expressed frustration manipulating public, appear expressing same, suggested course action (basically playing positive possibilities) also manipulation. Fauci engage manipulation, would seem prudent go conservative, well backed position moment, know whether mask use needed (in unspecified capacity, inherently mean everywhere day), vaccine adequately shown prevent spread. basically CERB. Rebranded get public‚Äôs eye. Honesty anyone giving shit kids partying year corona go hell. 

Young people missed best/most important parts lives old people charge literally nothing. friends developing severe depression lockdown. It‚Äôs long past point needs end. I‚Äôm left come getting ridiculous. I‚Äôm going live life point it‚Äôs mental health die of? one ever seizes power intention relinquishing seriously create better illustration problem ignorance America comment tried. published many fucking articles, radio stories, TV news features, even fucking cartoons explaining continue take precautions like wearing mask public even get vaccine. reason can't public officials give us nuanced information. BRB, moving Japan fake death I'm rush actually start living life again, also get economy back track. seriously see waiting longer hurting people unnecessarily?

Also commented earlier post virtually every expert field expected results. declining cases hospitalization deaths. Every expert expected study back it. peer reviewed exist.

Pretty much entire pandemic was, been, directed common sense experts. common sense saying 95% effective vaccines spread virus. Claiming people still need wear masks becoming immune prolonging pandemic reason. Cheers see many consider advanced civilization Earth. thing may matter... One whole theories heterogeneous nature spread may actually make conventional herd immunity thresholds meaningless. instance something different physiologically genetically super spreaders fewer super spreading opportunities get virus early effective herd immunity threshold significantly lower 75 85%. Could low 40 55%. might what's going US difficult explain. note: think that's what's going want throw another theoretical possibility Providence Theraputics believe started phase 1/2. think goign approved vaccine 2022. probably vaccinated then. Again, they've making pretty spectacular claims. I'm sure much trusted. 

If Manitoba buying vaccines order donate countries. say good Manitoba. I'm sure though much good going Canada. say someone that's cheering Providence Theraputics. fair, OP right - Trump, US boycott COVAX. recently Biden reversed US overtook UK biggest donor. don‚Äôt fear germs. live life fear never enjoy life Canada 58th place vaccine distribution world... poorly? quite case, far spread goes targeting whatsoever, risk death. one 70 seeing second shots (outside doctors ,front line medical workers, severely risk) June.

Wouldn't call game April, especially variants moving around.

640k week though fantastic news. chance get long haul treatment year? Anybody following research there? Cant see drug trials or
Research, can‚Äôt imagine drug companies would want to
Invest
After pandemic over. new customers. He‚Äôs moron. said still wear masks, socially distance, see family even getting vaccinated. Umm, That‚Äôs idiotic, stupid, isn‚Äôt based facts/data.

Was actually hear saying 'very likely' safe vaccinated family members hug others? Oh, know exist. reason we're begin with. Thanks speaking up. agency plans imposing global carbon tax Interesting. think seasonality? Seems like that, plus vaccine distribution, would flatten potential spike. I've heard attributed storage requirements meaning lot easier transport AZ vaccine care homes (and possibly home jabs vulnerable too?), whereas Pfizer one distributed hospitals specific vaccination centres. say borger Thank president Biden Who? Cries single man Thanks, one? say borger I'm pretty sure they're joking.

Or least hope so. 2021 set 2020 v2 despite enormous success understanding virus treatment, vaccinations, plummeting numbers. mindboggling. Who? likely already know mask vaccinated they're going tell people that

That's part problem. Health officials disservice public tell half-truths like this‚Äîor worse, *actually lie* (see: masks beginning pandemic, herd immunity numbers). short-term win long-term loss completely undermines credibility. Despite pessimistic crowd would believe, no, waves. remember scientists talking Category 5 hurricanes horizon ones *cannot* explain cases dropping precipitously right now, take opinions grain salt. Fewer spreaders fewer potential hosts means thing done. rarely travel internationally life basically already normal. mentality apply covid then? would also protect elderly, indirectly. thought get choice? None friends family who've got choice. Although also know anyone calls ""British one"" (not even pro Brexit, racist grandad) maybe I'm lucky.   Deaths lagging indicator many weeks, we're getting there. Fingers crossed! misguided post. 

Those idiots arena booing fans idiot match. science denying moron egging on.

The vast majority Australians excited get vaccinated. Meanwhile Netherlands going strong 4%üò© expect, we're better Americans anymore people love hysteria, exaggeration bullshit. Old people likely wear glasses too. They're risk group likely stay home. Well fact base information shared AZ much worse Pfizer all, bet lot people change mind. mean people set certain vaccine matter what, think vast majority people want vaccine proven efficient safe, case AZ vaccine. lockdowns Spanish Flu MUCH shorter global phenomenon. Hospitalisation risk also low 50s without health conditions. use safety goggles together reusable p100 respirator bright pink 60926 cartridges about. ""*It's* called *fashion*, *look up*"" case, understand get airtight seal without something ""sticking"" (effectively) nose... Glasses well

This also clearly means people work wearing wrong. you, regular ass person, think somehow good faith acceptable call nation sick generally demoralize exactly? got feeling egotistical altruism might help thought process along bit maybe make question stirring animosity. apologise ad hominem towards comment history I'm another person sea us I'm fed everyones bullshit attitudes (myself included). love better day ‚ù§Ô∏è Per Oslo Accords, Israel obligation Palestinian Authority (and definitely Hamas Gaza) handle responsibilities Palestinian health matters. Going excess deaths year, likely hit half million around mid-november. There's big increase aneurysms, heart attacks, strokes, etc. accurate estimate many months, perhaps year two.  vaccines 2 doses. Idk dude, see people infected licking public surfaces? 

People covid parties explicit purpose getting/ spreading covid, means ste flat whiing that, "" nobody goal spread thing"".

Safety procedures help reduce spread, 100% effective, even close. could follow safety procedures perfectly still get covid. didn‚Äôt discover badly recently. Per Oslo Accords, Israel obligation Palestinian Authority (and definitely Hamas Gaza) handle responsibilities Palestinian health matters. Population Israel, 8 million, UK, getting 70 million.

Not mention Israel getting fast track pass pretty much due work Pfizer studies Depends u see it. getting vaccine dying ninjas count? case would probably stil none without 2 week hotel quarantine. governments permission - isn‚Äôt easily granted. Yep, rhetoric Germany Macron fucking criminal going kill people.  damage done though. Despite EMA approving it, Germany places Europe, people literally refusing AZ vaccine offered it. media politicians done great job brainwashing people thinking inferior even useless vaccine. Entire shelves full it.

That's misinformation politicising healthcare do. people dying vaccine rollout slow Europe, remember politicians spread crap first place, blood hands. Except small minority people dying Covid, every young person experiencing profound losses. straw man. Nobody talking proms, bars college parties 
It‚Äôs deep rooted disruption, necessary unavoidable, . 

Younger kids still school 11 months later , athletes missing scholarships, kids feeling isolated point mental breakdowns suicides. It‚Äôs going long lasting impact . I‚Äôve pointed out, primarily hits lower middle class kids, rich kids private schools umbrella. 

Lockdowns necessary. Restrictions mitigation still . complete societal lockdown destructive. California vs Florida case point. Lockdown obsessed vs reckless selfishness, numbers similar. yeah fuck capitalism would considered design AZ; especially since suggestion used potential explanation better results seen 0.5/1 dose results (and Russian team using 2 different vectors shots). Preventing death bare minimum. Atlanta 500k people?. Damn that's small city. Either I'm spoiled North Eastern cities America hit 16% unemployment one point March didn‚Äôt pass 8% october. put things perspective. Again, demonstrably correct- look Florida. least open expect results we're getting now... Yes, variants around now. presence variants function widespread virus rather virus highly likely mutate. Also numbers speak selves people covid

  28 mil.  usa  

Canada... 900,000

  right understanding.  

Also usa makes it...canada gives away lol Lockdowns end extreme countries middle 2022. UK, Australia, Germany, Canada, US states many generally lighter, New Zealand, Ireland, etc. Within countries differences, course. Ugh thank you! hope people hold majority view, seem get point vaccines actually happy segregate people based whether want injection, well even considering could health risk vaccine developed unusually quickly. feel like I'm going insane. Maybe yous guys need more? taking cues idiot champ. Tokyo 10x larger chicago. 4x larger best. Never allergies life, yeah, think right this. likely body like component vaccine... Pfizer also include 3000 suspected cases data released back announced efficacy last year. means mask fitting properly. properly fitted, proper n95 draw air go respirator, irrespective glasses. Herd. Remember swine flu Even optimistic epidemiologists think we'll still wearing masks past opening schools fall. don‚Äôt see need go extraordinary lengths try protect people basically choose get infected

And dangerous thinking especially becomes popularized. longer spread goes, people get infected, virus mutate. could make current vaccines less effective... effective all. concern people might get immune adenovirus vector, would mean vaccinated later using vector. think saying ""pretty big city completely gone"" would work best. people handle magnitudes well.

Cleveland pretty big. Ten times larger Chicago. Ten times larger Tokyo. That's even number people without power Texas last week. Certain EU countries advising giving AZ people age 65 due lack data. I‚Äôm sure data presented, AZ suggested larger group. I'm concerned future workers rights most. stay home often, companies going abuse that.

Oh Bob home, quickly eve though scheduled work know home I'm boss can't say no?

I've already seen happen people. believe strong link amount reading screen usage eventual need glasses. could glass wearers overrepresented among highly educated (thus less likely go covid rallies follow simple precautions) also tech (more likely work home). super duper smarticles. /s name Macron? shutdown even needed? Cases already decreasing. ain't broke, fix it. stalking profiles waiting someone reply you? Nobody owes anything, weirdo. Exactly!!!  long-COVID deniers sub Reddit. Bear mind: rapper Scarface permanent kidney dialysis COVID. Alyssa Milano hair loss brain fog 5 months after. People needed double lung transplants COVID. people who've come heart issues. absolutely real. Totally get it. we‚Äôre black-and-white worldview back April didn‚Äôt know anything, person find shade gray works best. Seasonality go way. Look happened summer. I'm amazed people bending backwards remain pessimistic this. Immunity takes 3 weeks month people symptomatic 3 days spread within 2 infected. would easy outpace regard. would agree easy may quick release wouldn‚Äôt able outpace vaccinated that‚Äôs pretty much plan anyway. cases keep dropping rate are, might effectively cases April. can't see places staying closed happens. Almost certainly going happen even spread forever unmitigated. Virus mutations time tend become less less deadly, deadly. Certainly likely jump mortality 10%. guy point probably read disease dynamics. second wave seeding period third wave. second wave, mass increase mobility, led third wave, like predicted people yammering away already reached herd immunity. third wave brought halt changes mobility mean stop immediately. I've used analogy virus like freight train, compact car. stop dime. takes time. Even first wave took around month collapse implementation strict lockdowns sent mobility nearly -50%. 

Triple holiday peaks indicate mobility, immunity, responsible case increase/decrease. immunity, changes mobility would lead changes case numbers. already seeded third wave time mobility started downward. means going take longer time wave collapse changes mobility. wave extended holidays would peaked November 25th, corresponding around downward trending 1 month ~14% reduction mobility. always use second one later. Better nothing now. Never heard someone say anything Covid gun violence. 

Anyway im support legislation ban Cars. mean, *one death many*, right? Correlation =/= Causation Mentioning mask wearing necessary control spread enough get downvotes now. denier narrative whole thing overblown worst never happened. 500k+ dead, common response ""so what?"". 

I sympathy sharing anti mask sentiment. quite literally least get uncontrolled spread. likely August, later enough people get vaccinated. fast. actually dropped 40% four weeks ago. peak Jan. 26th 3400; 2k. Also might see slight increase week since Texas's winter problems artificially reduced numbers previous week given everything else going Im pretty sure reaching end bit increase holidays nothing like media predicting Sure, they're speaking publicly. Sure, fake news, EU, whatever, efficacy clinical trial also lower Pfizer's. see 3m/day (sustained) week next. supply yet. quite possible we'll see 3 weeks now, depending CDC announces they're shipping next week. week shipping 15.5M doses (a bit 2M/day), next week seeing somewhere around 2M/day. masks required? mention article Based what? 

Most epidemiologists, infectious disease experts, medical examiners said number undercount, largely testing unavailable rationed early months pandemic. looking excess mortality, claims valid. It‚Äôs not, also applies fed shipping 15.5M doses week. arrive later week/early next week. supply sustained 2m/day might quite yet. Like this

Scientists want know vaccinated people still become COVID-19 may prevent transmission Covid-19 vaccinated unvaccinated, Moderna chief doctor  Yes, goal. 

It optional long. 

Vaccinating vulnerable first first goal, preventing mutations might make previous rounds vaccination useless main goal, achieved vaccinating everyone. 

It within human capabilities, impossible. Even 2 million entire month March that‚Äôs nearly 67,000 people FULLY VACCINATED day month! I‚Äôm talking AstraZeneca (AZ). Sorry confusion.  Although EMA warned data 55s limited,3 clear single digit effectiveness Handelsblatt‚Äôs story baseless.

The claim newspaper false, commented speculation offering limited clarity, hardly approving timely manner. 

Absence evidence evidence absence yet prevailing reporting media evidence absence efficacy adults (despite reality). talking point repeated German French health regulatory bodies, latter choosing delay administering vaccine elderly.  researchers discovered correlation surge searches relating activities outside home ‚Äî activities could put people risk SARS-CoV-2 infection ‚Äî rise COVID-19 cases 10‚Äì14 days afterward. Infections fell increase searches relating stay-at-home activities.  China already tell didnt't start China ? thought CCP bought enough say yes sarcasm Yeah actually fair point. Although feel like US least kept humble stance saying FDA wouldn‚Äôt approve way, rather saying it‚Äôs bad strategy. 

The EU hand went completely red eyes started almost seemed like conspiracy campaign AZ vaccine absurd claims vaccine 8% efficacy rate. know media mostly claimed things politicians played it. 

Pisses avail since family lives Netherlands won‚Äôt get vaccinated anytime soon whilst relatively vulnerable, whilst I‚Äôm U.K. getting vaccine next weekend. Yes foundational milestones life discovering really person effect future absolutely value whatsoever. would anyone want little suggesting a) school driver infection b) teachers higher risk comparable groups (I.e. adults meet people). 

This whole argument schools somehow pools infections teachers risking lives keeps getting repeated sub. amount reporting contrary seems effect. driving around live, appears everyone out. ton traffic everywhere go. roads parking lots, appears prepandemic levels. infection expected. primary route deep throat 

That's risk I'm willing take. Might add clorox wiping beforehand safe safe though. 

In seriousness, far understood, (haven't checked months) primary route infection (where ACE2/TMPRSS2 plentiful) hypothesized nasal passage, could aspirate lungs (e.g sleep apnea) causing ground glass opacities seen CT scan

 however primary transmission route *outwards* hypothesized mouth nose (and elderly obese pegged inclined supermitters)

There's already plenty data, they're refusing pay attention it. picture worth thousand words never mentioned ... agree every proposal you‚Äôve made apart House Lords. time country overtaken populists (e.g. Brexit) provide counter balance long term interests mind. couldn‚Äôt stop Brexit something. suppose really depends define ‚Äúfun‚Äù want get life. think time fun life begun.

People tried bring last summer, got shushed believe AZ ramped production EU little spat many Germans French actively refusing accept AZ vaccines stockpiling EU can‚Äôt used, yet EU refusing let go elsewhere expire. absolutely bumblef**k EU made this.

The EU need accept they‚Äôve screwed offer send surplus vaccines countries become useless. they're pumping 12 million week April definitely huge Europe one. thought obvious two comments ago. ""Worse"" relative term here, given difference spectacular result spectacular result. Also believe Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation expected say earliest part vaccination program used Pfizer vaccine vulnerable need analysis wanted compare other, something right (both great going benefit anyone spend time deciding better) He's CNBC right saying probably going lock back winter virus seasonal, guess understand vaccinated would need lock again. - scientist. disinformation campaign. result thorough review national authorities. AstraZeneca free submit additional numbers renewed review. seem understand statistical significance works AstraZeneca simply meet initial submitted data cases among elderly differentiate groups. know much uk situation. point still stands. Disease spreads easily crowds. means makes sense would correlation schools reopening spike cases. heard mentioned uk subredddit people think dumb uk government announced want grades school kids back person March. 

You mention we've wearing masks since July. Yes that's long time. compared plagues history. plague Justinian lasted EIGHT YEARS. famous black death lasted 5 killed 1/3 Europe. Typhoid, coloera, measles, many claimed millions hundreds years. remarkably well compared horrors old. mean can't still better. 

And yes blame, disease spreads people get near other. course knowone wants starve homeless thats totally expected response. greater blame resides government providing citizens food shelter pandemic treating people disposable cog machine economy. totally disgusting people charge nation, ones suppose look welfare citizens, go ""oh well, people die, do."" jobs simply cannot put hold. Doctors, nurses, police, fire, farmers, energy producers, grocers, cashiers etc etc. second part isolation. Isolating limiting contact essential workers reduces chance people get sick, also reduces strain workload therefore society whole. 

This hard understand. sick person come contact sick person, sick person spread sickness. People governments simply refuse acknowledge fact make excuses can't done. let perfection get way progress. Yes wearing mask 100% effective. Yes people can't 100% isolate other. Yes people need eat place sleep. Covid going away. forever treated like small pox, another viral disease spreads droplets air like covid. deny slow spread save lives disgusting. narrative AZ vaccine dangerous Covid, thanks Macron know big trial but

Given deaths already two events bitched about. Ring ring! fogot yo bring bring! people get boners Asian cultures fucking weird, I‚Äôm death money, fake death dress widow collect, shhhhh don‚Äôt tell japan plan would, much EU course though.

Having US media attacking AZ almost day 1 Fauci criticising AZ, rollout, approval AZ UK strategy definitely helped. Really? I‚Äôd bit suspicious considering first I‚Äôve heard (with much family working NHS) American newspaper. covered. Cold weather makes want stay home go out.

America brought enough help southern neighbor puts us risk. might help done. really know J&amp;J going deliver lot anywhere. get feeling Novavax getting non-MRNA sales. We'll see can't really blame people one hear news leaders saying 8% effective. 

Fact currently great vaccine two excellent vaccines. thrilled instead trying undermine them. Yeah apart death like covid leaves completely fine got it. healthy young people get feel effects long after. want risk long term health. Sounds selfish can't pretend that's feel. I'm 25, scary thought ok, may die, long term health could compromised seriously catching covid. Obviously yes, small risk generally, still worrying thought. Ah ha! tell hospital component? start, health care HUGE vector. heard ""Suchandsuch Hospital safe! delay care!""

Bottom line: ignore efficacy numbers get everyone vaccinated fast possible. think right, virus concerns, fact live events industry workers decimated past year. gonna take revive infrastructure (and people) put shows what's criticism going today? optimistic? optimistic enough?

Justin Trudeau long promises, short action. problem requires something throwing taxpayer money it, isn‚Äôt going get done. Gottlieb said new variants virus first identified United Kingdom, South Africa Brazil create new risk could become prevalent U.S., enough reverse declines point.

""I think little, late parts country,"" said. ""With rising vaccination rates also fact we've infected third public, that's enough protective immunity we're likely see trends continue."" mean protected current variants. current vaccines protect severe Covid-19 even variants. That's important means people vaccinate, fewer people need go hospital. remember, that's whole reason we've needed lock wear masks. render Covid dangerous as, say, common cold, that's still huge victory. Get vaccinated soon possibly can. Serbian fans get Australia watch Open? must already living Australia.

Definitely, original read message talking containing infection vaccines. article good job summarizing case anyone wants understand. talking J&amp;J proved effective, AZ not.

When take glasses I'm breathing _through_ mask like I'm sucking air around mask openings. normal people breathe masks on? Surely that's ineffective? 

For context, usually wear KN95. look extra wearing supplied work, agree comment - better seal help fog glasses.  better time reopen go back normal now? Usa 330 billion people

Ahhhh turned 46 killing me. spent number years depressed, anti-depressants sort made gain weight. I'm meds, cleared depression, lost weight Covid hit. I'm also single living alone. last year super depressing I'm holding (not gaining weight back discipline still manage). 


I cleared life wham, Covid isolation. sure serious Jake Steiner... world shouldn‚Äôt second class citizens US, even they‚Äôre number one country fucked around taking serious Theres lot immigrants there

Illegals included? four months mandatory mask everywhere policy country work great, govt preparing ban non-surgical masks. Yeah, that's going work. great news. shipments Russian vaccines Palestine blocked last time researched matter. masks social distancing required indoor capacity limits still place, fair call reopening? Seems everyone left behind. don‚Äôt like Trump wouldn‚Äôt call adult honestly, buy you‚Äôre right, great job securing vaccines. Second Israel, I‚Äôd say. Maybe ask young people missing say miss going out. needs met going parties youn person fulfilled locked away`? Libertarian attitude prevailing attitude, people would elected Jo Joe. Libertarians personal freedoms first, core expectation care neighbors instead government taxing us death using funds cheap sock puppet show caring neighbors. 

Be mindful broad brush strokes. a, mask wearing, proudly vaccinated, Libertarian. Yeah didn't. doctors nurses wearing them. hell could masks increase infections? Time reopen. Actually pretty major sacrifice. know things happen lifetime right? culture cut unified response long term personal responsibility.

Australia New Zealand? Atlantic Canada bubble?

Western culture doesnt suck personal responsibility. Rather, Western politicians ill-equipped take economic costs willing placate far right extremists America *HAS* #1 everything! citizens stupid need hyper aggressive rollout Yep. need become less dependent nations. would probably take generation, I‚Äôd
love if:

- would able produce medical supplies. PPE, masks, vaccines, antibiotics, etc.

- would producing warships, submarines, tanks airplanes. 

Between Arctic (that Russia always encroaching upon), Great Lakes, numerous lakes country...we probably easily accessible fresh water world. need able defend Russia, China, etc take want. We‚Äôve learned USA volatile can‚Äôt trusted get political system fixed.

My 2 cents expressly specified ""temporarily"". would necessary first place actually delivered amount vaccines promised. Yeah, country bigger population that. encouraging see death numbers declining around world Israelis smart great job. Quite success story. shows another way.  Also Americans unprepared winter. less surprises Russia winter comes. It‚Äôs estimated third Americans already currently immunity (check recent ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll herd immunity April‚Äù article Johns Hopkins prof that‚Äôs circulating recently). many people already COVID probably people won‚Äôt want get shots, actual percentage population immunity least somewhat higher (and possibly significantly higher) whatever percentage vaccinated is.  Anybody thought overpromising probably following actual numbers. can't think way might overpromising India here, donating vaccines. Peru here. politicians getting vaccines doctors, nurse lying it. news. Yep original statement crazy arguably two countries performed worst entire Pandemic somehow managed absolutely nail vaccination rollout.

Does anything fact vaccine producing entities situated inside borders?

It would seems like COVID huge lesson globalization. Letting PPE vaccine production outsourced lead unexpected shortages emergencies supplier countries get preferential treatment shipped much easily, definitely help supply issues faced almost entire world. possible U.S. actually need J&amp;J vaccine current supply enough herd immunity months, rest world benefit greatly this. Something factored crowd probably Serbia. antivax movement unbelievably strong among Serbs. Israel amazing job, can't compare country 9 million country 331 million. Israel 3% population US. 3 people vaccinate 100, course reach milestones faster, even resources. better comparison countries similar population sizes. think long disease spreading, among children otherwise, potential mutate strain vaccines cannot protect against. Palestinians gotten it, fuck usual? anyone actually died Covid vaccine? pretty obvious result be: 
employees leverage treated better employees less leverage sounds like avoiding question annoying dismissive. wtf kinda response Since gave normal Vitamin takes 2-3 weeks process Calcifediol, study waste time conducted not-so-bright researchers. need even comment junk. Belgium here, mom got vaccinated 2 weeks ago. However, vaccination centers 100 vaccines day moment, meaning 15 minutes, center close ran vaccines. 

So Ironic vaccines get made Belgium neighboring countries. Unfortunately hanging cord whist wearing mask fog wearing both. least people getting vaccine.

I remember hearing report wealthy, private neighborhood four hundred shots per capita low-income neighborhood. course that's info reported, nothing average age either community. New Zealand echoing Australia per norm Looks like we're there, Japan, Canada, Australia spent larger portion GDP Covid stimulus (Japan quite lot, apparently), several countries spent nearly much us relatively mask going anything scenario constantly taking drink? safe meet bar casual conversation safe without mask. Masks reduce spread. Masks reduce severity. Especially population isn‚Äôt sufficiently social distancing. Masks would made huge difference Sweden. Sweden comparable Denmark Norway, rest Europe. question exactly caused bad comparison. preprint. Excess deaths 2020 40% higher official Covid deaths. Also, flu deaths much estimate Covid deaths. Yes, that's right--""only small *additional* effect."" paragraph full information. whole article really impressive. would admission 

So don‚Äôt question ‚Äúadmit‚Äù ... long admission fits expectations? statement doesn‚Äôt make much sense, imho. I'm one calm people it. figure widely adopted? Damn, real estate prices go even crazier :O Nobody dies people still giving birth suppose. Like lot people thread, I'm optimistic side. travel vacations planned late summer fall. also think COVID final throws, truly heading everything getting back normal soon. I'm cautious, course, things take time.

I feel like March largely like February been. Cases continuing go down, well hospitalizations deaths. vaccinating quickly we'd like, still shortages, continue roll consistently. general think learned mistakes good system going. could better, we're can.

In April, think going see changes. cases going throughout March well, LOT vaccines delivered, things start relaxing bit. local governments figure looks like area, cases, completely open, others still see things closed. Masks still generally required worn.

It's hard predict much further. think May lot like April is, think much changed. vaccinated lot people May, restrictions continue ease. think real test Memorial Day. end May, think people general going enjoy - restrictions dammed. BBQ's, Pool Parties, gatherings, that. goes June determine rest year. see meaningful spike? so, think reminder country done yet, still need careful. humbling experience, continue avoid gatherings like did, remember put masks like been, little least. cases bump, think indication start moving marking return normal, once, added confidence.

Memorial Day COVID groundhogs day. cheers beers mountaineers Ah yes, withholding opportunity informed consent last moment, truly hallmark ethical medical care. It‚Äôs funny account got permanently banned cause said old b guy calling g word got canned hateful comments, said nothing hateful ever anything describing hate towards me, I‚Äôm g still ridiculous that? China part EU? NZ? Japan? UAE? Israel? Canada? UK?

Why countries collaborate EU critical times? 

Or collaboration means ""Deliver us vaccine asap f$ck off""? Ok cases Germany rising... They‚Äôre falling. absolutely reason reopened back normal April. ??? never said anything pure altruistic spirit. Weird response. Same. see gatherings/groups young people stuff together warms heart little knowing spirit spontaneous *live* still alive. I'm going guess [this predicted exercise. one saying masks everything. idea top 5 list is, I‚Äôm betting masks there, especially Sweden restricting movement gathering much others. That‚Äôs exactly situations masks important. December January brutal Europe whereas USA thing always bad roughly constant... smaht knew something like coming. No, Australian. Last death beginning ask? influence long term, unfortunately I'm long since college noticed thing - used trainer gym day long I'd chit-chat colleagues clients I'd see classes I'd teach...all people knew casually interacted regularly. work home individually clients same. I'd spend much time alone without acquaintances kept occupied. People saying can't compare countries. can't compare rest well? reason people seem think Nordic countries clones exact circumstance rest Europe completely different comparison thrown out.

As Swede I'm tiered click bait strategy got turned political battle handle corona virus countries. proving ""wrong"" became politic necessity. said buy it. know transmission occur without symptoms. 

Can someone who‚Äôs asymptomatic able transmit virus without testing positive? pretty regular thing. Emergency responders practice constantly. yeah holy shit, turns exercises run time. 1.5

Disappointing done well fairly well sounds like I'm sure totally expected consider long been, fractured response is, what's left ahead know.

While vaccines certainly showing early winter much now, timeline widespread adoption also became quite clear introduction. Perhaps November, people willing think ""just little ways go"" december, even clear many months waiting most, that's become clear 2021.

They‚Äôre also potentially least likely transmit illness they‚Äôre exhibiting symptoms / low viral load. 

Therefore, metrics vaccinate 75% population (everyone else) would attainable June. Given 1/5 people don‚Äôt want vaccine (ish) that‚Äôs end May anyone wants one get one. much optimism.

Forgive life college American student loans doesn‚Äôt sound appealing college environment. ""D-Day"" appropriate analogy this.

D-Day important turning point World War II. known number deaths happened, beginning liberation France.

We might described release first vaccine covid-19 like D-Day. People voted harper different reasons trudeau. Harper/flaherty stability austerity. Trudeau wealth redistribution. judge different criteria.

Harper left alot desired terms society well economically. trudeau opposite. Neither perfect ideologys required different times. little complicated red vs blue According numbers CDC, vaccine distribution US dropped consistently last week. averaging 1.7M per day averaging 1.3M. figure due weather/power problems south, knows.

The real questions journalists exploring switching hifi masks late good idea, go 1 shot instead 2. would real journalism. life life. saying 83y.o median death age tragic another age stupid insanely inhumane say. lives taken granted. truly clue. Quit believing Trump's bullshit. April United States, biggest ongoing issue going convincing people still get vaccinated even COVID seems disappeared. tend social northerners sometimes content stay home 24/7. Warmer climate could help. \^\^This too.

Without getting much politics (so strictly subject Coronavirus, vaccines, etc.), really appreciate things Biden admin done. would incorrect. agree. That's Canadian government's hands unfortunately. mostly hear people blame government news without knowing what's actually going on. media can‚Äôt wait 500k milestone. None friends partners lost jobs even gotten hours cut (freaking miracle right there, seriously). friend groups type travel around celebrations. I've flown 4 different states bachelorette birthday parties pre-2020. One went another continent birthday 2019. weird cheap house rental drive to, seriously norm. 

I think need focus friends comfortable, trust people's minds change eventually.

What's really happening this... Everyone going conventions already virus immunity better they're saying US absorbing 100% R&amp;D... making back cost vaccine.

Further, Pfizer's vaccine developed Germany. Unfortunately people don‚Äôt realize this. isn‚Äôt problem. wasn‚Äôt Trudeau Harper. It‚Äôs decades since produced vaccines domestically. haven‚Äôt actually recommitted even though Quebec facility fell through... well... Anyone else little skeptical nearly good news studies vaccine coming Israel - country authoritarian vaccine? Seems fishy me... many people  


how many? seen reports major Indian cities 60% seroprevalence rates. u smoking crack? 

Socialized medicine government pays 2k month 6 months. Hows 1400 dollars going guys. 

Mom getting chest pains. Went hospital within 3 hours got ekgs, mris, blood tests. whole thing cost 30 dollars parking. Id wager 70% americans would went bed hoped went away. 

Sure vaccines would cool 1 year covid 21k deaths. 


Our standard much higher thats thing left critique lackluster vaccine rollout. isnt even anyones fault. Canada mediocre soft power influence.

Moderna already  It‚Äôs disgusting Trump failed terribly. yes, know deaths continued Biden took office actions Trump caused many unnecessary deaths. states bidding PPE, ordered vaccine offered. Biden took office. Try fog block cloth. [Here Twitter January predicting February 14 ""new variant"" would take ""change game... vaccinate enough people.""

Not sure people still hanging every word Pfizer board member. course he‚Äôs manipulating public. take: Johns Hopkins doctor said herd immunity April. Alabama epidemiologist said she‚Äôs seeing thing. doctors saying news looking good.  Fauci took Sunday morning interview rotation poured cold water excitement.  knows every interview version ‚Äúwhen get back normal?  know, says something shocking like masks 2022 spread like wildfire. instead excited public going go right back pits well, life doesn‚Äôt get come back 15 months yet. Maybe intention. Ya huh Get second one tomorrow!!! Harper power 9 years didn‚Äôt rebuild anything. assume mad well?

If guess we‚Äôll go 10 years it‚Äôs fault since Harper gets blame 9 years. see. technologically underdeveloped countries unable cool things -80¬∫C -60¬∫C, non-problem anyway: meticulous study leading MIT scientist backed seroprevalence data consistent CDC official numbers. concerning think misinformation. could handed them, need get violent. ER America. Yeah absolutely. people want absolutely zero reminder Covid restrictions moving forward, ain't happening. wait like vacc US till summer/end summer, I'll wearing mask grocery stores shit afterwards. damn easy. catch Covid simply touching eyes droplets hitting eyes? respiratory virus. don‚Äôt. fancy new lenses allow wear glasses without fogging shower would nice able see bottles I‚Äôm grabbing. Young population, strong immune systems, low comorbities (obesity) means Covid isnt nearly deadly West. Depends live. Lots cheap rent opportunities small businesses. NY stay quiet long. many people here. Fog block cloth cheaper. Get ""fog block"". never problem again. Get ""fog block"". never problem again. would argue efficacy significantly lower we'll see marketplace says Get ""fog block"". never problem again. Exactly even vaccines given US compared Canada still safer go grocery store Canada. dont know Canadian citizens complaining much, statistically yall done 3 4 times better.  Might need wake 3am rent car drive 6 hours miss classes, idk honestly I‚Äôve never driven anywhere near long. Sucks appointment might reach :( wearing glasses shower? saw message thought ""it's like CLEAR vaccinations"" sort it, there's lot it.  


There's heck board Trustees Commons Project backs it. Interesting idea. would argue something different... never seriously tried eradicate flu used sub-par vaccines okay that. different situation opportunity use much better types vaccines. vaccines flu vastly inferior natural infection. use mRNA vaccines influenza guess would eradicate pretty quickly. issue flu difficult multi-valent vaccines MRNA right one strain possibly two. Flu vaccines either three four strains. What‚Äôs pastors much power black communities? Probably, University Hospital London Ontario. news sometime ago. Get ""fog block"". never problem again. Oooohhh!!! know one! name them. Jussie Trudeau, French Canadian dude (don't remember name right now), fat mayor named Rob Ford, Rick Moranis, guy named Vancouver keep hearing lot about. 

Okay, remember all, pretty close. experiences environments unique rare others. really getting element shit hit first time. High school somewhat shitty, college going fantastic. 

And it‚Äôs ripped away. I‚Äôll never get time back. Get ""fog block"". never problem again. means George Constanza. tell /r/conservatives. They're wanking Biden ""not fulfilling covid promises."" üôÑ wear safety glasses go grocery stores mask lol Okay mRNA frozen ice would degrade? Super easy strip things away, good fucking luck ever getting back again. money funneled somebody's pocket now, they're gonna want give back greater market vaccines shipped stored temperatures -20¬∞C require one dose. Oh man. bother making comment could easily spend time google one single source. Muppet. Thank posting this! get much hate that.  lot weird things seem somewhat protect corona virus. Apparentlt nicotine users, smokers otherwise, underrepresented Covid hospitalizations complete opposite, suggesting nicotine something often accompanies could help protect comtracting virus. Well, putting specific percentage chances things happening.

My belief Sars-CoV-2 (and variants) around good. We've decades ""cure"" common cold flu, happen. we'll end annual boosters COVID, like flu. means we'll need lots vaccines available around world, permanently.

But knows certain? vaccines *now* good news. Get ""fog block"". never problem again. What‚Äôs wrong sending kid school mask? person ""older 20s"", say good you, glad happy day.

Don't ashamed.

Back many years ago young used revolt rules, somehow changed Today. see many 20s compliant people Earth, follow media trust politicians way never imagined. Measels R0 15 managed effectively eliminate it.. least anti-vax movement off. called nerd

Who‚Äôs laughing now? Thank you. Imagine would economically medically cons sold Connaught Labs 30 years ago. There's many advancements vaccines since then, would amazing opportunity help world. Thank reply. sure German government seams think it‚Äôs going dominant strain soon. also freaking UK strain even though guys much better now.

I trying ignore now. socially distance wait out. never offered vaccine anyway. time get group either control current vaccines useless.  op wonder why? Canada's collective bargaining drug process? like drug companies make lot money Canada, choose them? reason? 90 days protocol vaccine site booked tickets show Chicago October. know show could cancelled rescheduled, social distancing built seating chart. positive sign live entertainment may gearing return. caused privatization conservatives pushed 8 years ago.

It's like someone hits car hammer asks ""do think perhaps market lacked incentived protect cars?""

The conservatives think producing vaccines internally worth it, sold capacity I‚Äôm bald wear glasses. wonder means me? CDC estimates 35% Americans infected already much different all. say different scared slight changes doomsayers past decade. STILL seem struggling fact said 99% population survives this...

Yes, elderly infirm die Covid...know else kills elderly infirm...literally everything... *Some experts believe parts country are¬†now nearing¬†those two magical words could bring relief, great cost:¬†Herd immunity.* Also, likely touch face see someone else touch face. mean, true. America we're talking about. Expecting us dicks pretty ""charitable"". ironic bc comfort mask wearing switched contacts.  make sure use clean part f hand arm. variants around entire time? seems many sudden.

AZ prevents hospitalization getting it. still get long covid main concern healthy younger person. prevent need mRNA one... found zero articles AZ prevent this. whole idea measures protect others. okay risk, they'll take vaccine protected, nothing that. China, virus came mean, yeah, fuck people too. Call Plague Rats well, they're drop Florida, 3.6 million Canadians visited last year, making quarter foreign tourists, according state tourism office. Visit Florida estimates 15,000 Canadians arrived April September, last month available statistics. That's 99% decrease period last year.

They far likely endangering country US return home, nothing systemic policy problems make US Covid-hub. Sure, could argue keep leaving, evidently, neither could US keep Americans home April Sept either. rate, US 88.5k cases per million Canada 22.2k cases per million, country overall think fault? Agreed 31m. least two graduating classes going royally screwed job market. 

The aftershocks half-assed lockdowns felt decades. Ruined finances, industries posing years growth, derailed careers...on top abysmally unfriendly culture towards need help &amp; woefully under-resourced social safety net. Could linked testosterone. Men likely severely ill form Covid testosterone makes men go bald. Maybe baldness though. anyone actually sued successfully?

Biden: ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna follow sCieNcE. Everyone wear glasses around neck say so. Even don‚Äôt wear glasses‚Äù Surely mean good jab. I‚Äôll get coat. Whenever anyone says ‚Äúcorrelation equal causation‚Äù know dealing Id 10 error. Well next week feds delivering (I think) 15.5 million doses normal state deliveries (13.5M) direct pharmacy deliveries (2M) see least 2M per day average soon. top that, Pfizer said they‚Äôre doubling deliveries next weeks ... 2.5M? 3M maybe? really curious see. Early polls showed 35-50% people ""eager"" take it. However reports UK 95% seniors taking it. might puffed bit convince people, see.

The proof demand US starts drop off. 50 million seniors, 18 million health care workers, we've given 43 million first doses. 60-70% population going take vaccine, demand might start drop soon. actually think people way dismissive ""deflections"". Yes, whataboutism appeal hypocrisy. Yes, face objective measure truth, appeal hypocrisies logical fallacies, argue objective measure lacking, appeals hypocrisy valid arguments.

Our current world really operate inherent principles. western nations employ laws governed precedence. world international relations well, countries set bar whatever doing. think controversial. know it, I'm actually little surprised people put 2 together.

When rules fixed governed precedence, every action acceptable somebody's eyes, every consistent position taken. case hypocrisy greatest sin one commit.

Yes, like pointed ""we horrible things, need change"" good response, however that's situation find in. Instead countries responding amounts ""It's ok it, it. mention fact whataboutism"".

That makes sense. Yes, summer 2021 - kids that. I‚Äôm sure know came one else able ascertain host virus bat virus combined create SARS-CoV-2. 

At least heard. magic 8-ball missing Hazy, Ask Later option. Well, give away AZ vaccines developing countries like mine, then. sure would use readily happily! Predictions future news? Lmfaooo okay tough guy. people working shifts times. going every single employee 100% time. People physically mentally need least day week. day decide celebrate holiday family it. 

You sound immensely ignorant ungrateful people done last year. could ever I'm sure. holding rolling stockpile guarantee number days worth second shots. There's enough supply issues want use every vaccine soon got it. It‚Äôs fucking hard lose entire year half college this. supposed best years life. NEVER get time back.

February 2020 got new full-time non-retail job. Also got license. Month later, car.

Was supposed great year. Australia here. guys getting Vaccines? took pools pools money. thing America great producing. turn tables 

(We really exported vaccines Canada tho) have~300 million people need vaccine. think sound done week? assume graduated ""nothing ever good enough stop complaining"" school explain new rise infections almost European countries except UK? hope Canadian friends get vaccinated soon. Bullshit. suggested someone help - implies need help reason gotten spot get help. single confirmed case

Not hard falsify I'm hard time squaring 2022, unless comes ""rolling back"" restrictions versus ending outright. see point keeping restrictions via slow sunset conditions outlined (in July hypothetical) met.  Awesome news! Variants hot right now. countries using AZ cannot really use MRNA people acting like good thing??? Sneeze get stroke heart disease... small problem. get another virus Stop downvoting this. Yeah it‚Äôs dumb joke, it‚Äôs meant dumb joke.

No. Absolutely not. experts going bite bullet harder ever imagine constant incompetence messaging. mask mandate compliancy come Memorial Day latest. r/kamikazebywords  serbia everyone getting sinopharm, one know bad side effects (the thing sleepy/had pain arm) Btw permanently banned /r/COVID19 asking question.

I confused. Yay. It‚Äôs time optimism. already?

I could sworn hit 500k ages ago. idea thought that. Eyeglasses also limit spread laser vision. people know adherent concerned COVID 25-40 range. think could due number factors ranging parents higher risk demographic media peer pressure social media lockdown lockdown hard. I‚Äôve heard friends used words like ‚Äúshell shocked‚Äù ‚Äúbunker mentality‚Äù frightens me. acquaintances terrified even leave house statistically incredibly low risk severe illness death.

The psychological fallout going last far longer pandemic needs national plan address it. Honestly overreacting. Small businesses closed, that's fact. source 1500 cops? crime increased 2020 homicides (447, 8+ million people). type crimes went down. ability isolate easily though, elderly retired leave house everyday, younger people go work. according source thehindu.com covishield similar exactly AZ one. Still can't find anything effectiveness. polls depressingly low terms people ""eager"" get vaccinated.

The counterpoint though US many countries probably headed towards widespread immunity need 90% even 70% 50% people vaccinated reach herd immunity. think closer 35%, many already exposed.  Yes no. summer case counts much lower now, whole situation months old people happy house again. 

That said, vaccine cases keep falling, going tough people accept much longer. production ramps get hurdles roadblocks, vaccine Pfizer Moderna quantity, come mid/late spring (at least US). Give months. Love this. got literal death threats saying life get lot less comfy choose vaccinated. vaccine? That‚Äôs fine. Guess you‚Äôll saying home, parties, dining out, visits grandma, perhaps losing job getting ostracized social circles. Sorry sweetie! Uh, bootlickers detained Huawei executive. would let return China. precisely bootlickers got screwed. UK? Genuine question. someone please explain logic ""I feel comfortable social even *after* vaccinated?"" 

I'm talking someone lives at-risk person, public facing job they're concerned spread whatever. I'm talking healthy, 30 something people, used decently robust social life. probably offered vaccine decent chunk population vaccinated anyway. **I understand.** even point vaccine then?!?!?!

I couple friends like want rude, wtf?!? would ask directly want make hesitancy worse. someone mindset, please help try see what's going help shell. dont think mindset healthy, personally. friend, anything do??

Fuck covid, functionally killed friendships reason die. Yeah, shit, Biden team.

Everybody knew 100M lowballing I've consistently made case lowballed could come news ""we beat end time frame"" country-wide morale booster. they're lying.

Because they're liar. Meanwhile, prince Harry left chat. Permanently. William amused. Man would guessed population leave house daily basis things like work school interact public might large vector disease spread vaccinating said people interacting public daily basis might slow spread... UK signed contract eu signed theirs. still would like know full story behind this. 

And course nationalism. EU (successfully) tried suppress vaccine nationalism members, price pay low roll-out compared others, steady fair distribution nonetheless. original guidance simple. ""Flatten curve"" overwhelm hospitals.

Well, hospitalizations declining rapidly reports overwhelmed. curve flat headed zero. So... over? Idk id rather less people overall die getting vaccine first I'm saying New Zealand (and many Asian countries too, unique) shown possible eradicate virus within country. make believe imaginings, provably true example. idea. pointing countries actually done this. 
If work, explain countries active spreading pandemic? here. I'm college freshman now, still feel like I'm part school. miss little fun things come in-person. cried week school year started hit big college career would start community, friends, dorming, weekend trips, girlfriend, sports, clubs locked Zoom Discord, orientation set awkward virtual meetings. I've dreaming going college past four years. top all, I'm trapped parents' house, expected fine Zoom learning. still hurts. like calm eye storm way  takes away 16 years life ? Weeks months? Canada military? üòâ Sorry dude, mean hurt you. trying help. Absolutely worse college, one would argue that. But, everyone know, college gets worse time. first second year classes often grade-school level, nearly stressful face later on.

My point expect college fun media portrayals, set depression. I'm speaking personal experience that. 

I feel bad missed time, I. trying temper expectations bit fall trap did. College fun,but also horrible. obviously wish got experience rather stuck home. saying temper expectations bit, help so.  Thank wishes. checked state website say group opens scheduling 15th. sure scheduled Sunday 14th? Cuomo Deblasio seeking eradication policy time feasible. Whoever stays NY paying price decades. 100,000 already died Biden‚Äôs watch. Also math average COVID victim live 98 since average age death 82.... someone asks mask wearing going continue 2022 answer emphatic no

I'm sure unless want tell people want hear. think highly likely need this, 100%. negate life experiences? everyone goes college still pretty full lives. life keeps getting better, couple years full travel back open. life experiences since turned 30 far eclipse anything before. youth pretty banging! people build lives experiences, year 2 college tragedy, sorry. graduated year half early BA, 21. Life gets better better. new president place seems like US getting shit back together Parents got first Moderna shot California weeks ago. 

Unfortunately follow appointment cancelled due insufficient supply. Hope get soon. I‚Äôm worried variants emerging third world wait get vaccinated reinfect us next year. mean numbers always debate, general agree notion time we've vaccinated vulnerable, time healthy vaccination buffer would otherwise spreading person person, would make sense take balanced approach rolling back restrictions.

To me, ""resembling normalcy"" means numbers come low enough starts approach typical rates viruses vaccines. would easier justify rolling back things like masks keeping distant (or even compromise, like fine X people space, wear mask, vice-versa), perhaps still emphasize things like washing hands cognizant breathing faces others, etc. really know would look like agree restrictions need fit numbers acceptable risk levels, always going debatable. in-person church

In state courts already emphatically said may prohibit church gatherings. said none that. did, made assumption.

I merely said regular time fine- they're human get tired tired people make mistakes mistakes get people killed. Taking time normal part good physical mental health. There's reason normal days OT administer vaccines. fact, many nurses doctors offices surgical teams slowed elective surgery slowed in-person visits doctor's offices. competent medical professional administer vaccinations mostly hospital staff working overtime 12 hour shifts six days week. medical clinics laid staff off. entirely absurd ask hospital staff OT order administer vaccinations, though. stop wearing masks? fucking blows. sorta like

Except Asian countries *have* mandated masks covid. vaccine seems able protect mutant forms virus. Governments first take care citizens worry countries. much important US get economy back running. forced give money government, least protect people first. No. vaccines don‚Äôt work restrictions drop anyhow. People aren‚Äôt going accept going forever without socializing, gathering, etc. vaccine tests 95% effective doesn‚Äôt stop virus, risk it. Meanwhile places like Israel already giving adults. Yes can. place shadow was. visited relatives months ago downright depressing. Cuomo Deblasio everything could make sure people leave never come back. thank NAFTA this. living proof hollowing manufacturing capacities. We're spoke, hub. course - goes without saying. people sub irrationally fearful ones, rest world hanging friends families. know they're that. data. Instead, enjoyed standard holidays weekends people died.

You can't lie. internet nowadays. access data. know saying true. Damn lasik bad idea There's difference except riots antisocial activity burning cities hurts prosperity social tranquility big sports events contribute it. less culture ignoring public health standards Canada US. full concerts LA without worry infection? Well Germany actually one hardest lockdowns according Oxford... Problem opinion schools open Monday numbers rising many people dont care restrictions... allowed See one Person, Shops closed, Events every kinds forbidden, part Germany musnt leave house 9pm mustnt move 15km home without explicit reasoning wear ffp2 public places. Additionally Companys must send workers Home Office possible... yeah already really restrictive harshness isnt Problem, people fed restrictions dont care fiance works nursing home Alberta. shot yet given indication going happen residents staying there. covid outbreak last week. 20%ish people tested positive it. go 3 separate covid tests time. Kenny announced supported seniors recieved first vaccines carefully worded statement. Supported living seniors AHS type building. got relatives work hospitals recieved shots data entry ward workers. see one person work day. would worker get vaccine shot none AHS staff actually deal covid positive residents/patients dialy basis. Btw figured got hit baddly quickly. one senior building caught going family visits. gets tested covid positive isolate him. isolated constantly pulling emergency alarm cord. Asking things like help phone, iPad tv set. staff wear full ppe but. go now. scared? live NYC confirm rapidly turning scary dump.

Subway crimes spiked they're calling 1500 cops patrol subway stations... taxes hiked rate people cannot afford... thousands small businesses permanently closed... innumerable amount homeless people longer getting mental help need turning violent .

This things come mind now... yes bad even recent leaks found AZ contract UK actually similar. let's get clear. following perfectly acceptable:

-Shut businesses (to point small businesses go under)
-Stay home literal years
-Government-mandated masks, curfews, significant restrictions

HOWEVER, following totally OK:
-Ask nurses work one weekend holiday day every week vaccinate people.

Your worldview absurd survive even basic scrutiny. Come dude, 100% true, especially outside Manhattan. limit spreading others. Assuming don‚Äôt ‚Äúwalk‚Äù gives away. 

Ah yes, old 99% argument. 

Talk tired rational. 99% flights successful, would 100 plan crashes day. 

When apply numbers large enough population, 99% isn‚Äôt anywhere close safe. Unless consider flying 100 crashes every single day. Something tells you‚Äôd suddenly want higher number 99%.

You deny Covid deaths ‚Äúdeath normal‚Äù want. parents vaccinated get jab it‚Äôs turn, deny severity rest hopefully pleasant life. Well, actually puts PR cap becomes PR person. he's terrible PR stay behind curtain send someone else craft messaging. crazy company patent makes billions, allow production parts world share patents. Capitalism great! *NEW RECORD* Yeah right know reached is. one issues big discrepancy lab studies show far antibodies go we're seeing real world. reconciled going difficult determine. Novavax said think related particular type effector B cell counting neutralizing antibodies going tell degree effector cell likely actually gives immunity. remains lot learned although I'm pretty optimistic Well shit think goal get many people vaccinated possible? understand charge afraid getting away hopefully come senses numbers continue decline.

To becoming increasingly clear countries around world approaching herd immunity exposure vaccine icing cake. virus simply can't spread forever, run deer headlights months, know say see terrible numbers. hopefully spokespeople mental health, education, schools, jobs, businesses, families, etc. remind need reopen society sooner vs. later. technically did. utter tragedy one robust pandemic response plans, built improved upon decades, end morons last administration threw away. get either. Maybe calculation time UK would stock, EU supply would ready, cause issues.

Hope, quick call arrange something though, issues still done. That's USA astronomically mishandled virus policy perspective, let hundreds thousands people die, took weak stance shutdowns cost lives, etc... simultaneously almost nothing support businesses individuals, leading mass economic distress, collapse economy still managed benefit wealthy. 

Then GLOBAL scientific triumph occurred, US approached entirely selfish perspective global stage, raising finger help countries need.

Meanwhile, Russia China, typical bogeymen, stepped aid smaller countries around world.

So yes, think criticism halves story wholly warranted. lovely hear. Hug loved ones. Somehow, Brazil actually given first dose 6 million people. Considering f\* handling pandemic around here, I'd say that's nothing short miracle. Canada also less 5% number cases US has, think they'll fine. seem use word lot. exactly mean it? you. Nice job, wait another 10 years start figuring get gen. Population vaccinated Half enforcement convincing people right thing do. enforcement brute strength alone effective. yes Trump fault state entire country. Yeah need Fauci tell hug parents get vaccinated, soon full courses going worried going see them. mean, shit? Giving honest assessment saying ‚ÄúI know‚Äù don‚Äôt answer. wear glasses around house now. Going store wearing mask? Contacts go Fauci needs learn English say ""Well probably wearing masks 2022, life likely get back normal sometime summer increasing vaccinations, put behind us"" Lmao 2022 ""resembling"". 

'21 man. emphasis mathematical theoretical herd immunity overblown ridiculously idealist- material. 

Low deaths. Low hospital rates. Normal. go. 

Fauci seemingly contradictory admitted biased statements; hard see criticism comes lack examples look thread- people provide it. complaining citations citations. real question negative rules. Lots places said can't wear masks anything covers face beforehand, like security reasons. might happen anymore could come back. I'm also almost 30, college 4 years, i'll tell ya continually discovering well beyond traditional college years. Everyone's got different set circustances lifr different pace. sorry can't normal university stuff pandemic, please let anyone tell ""should be."" argument is:

-Businesses shut down, point people losing livelihoods potentially losing multi-generation businesses.

-People stay home literally years.

-Massive restrictions movement.

-Mandatory mask wearing everywhere.

All sacrifices OK, they're no-brainers eyes.

But asking nurses work hours weekend put vaccines arms elderly several thousand die per day *just much* really quite silly trade-off?

Can see partisan absurd worldview become? makes absolutely sense demand many sacrifices society large yet *not* ask nurses simply occasionally work day weekend. unfortunately vaccines they're probably late much use. enormous advantage first Pfizer reaping advantage that. shot keep carrying spreading virus? I‚Äôm seeing lot people saying happy don‚Äôt wear masks anymore... College unique time life comes once. Please let us know secret getting eyelash eyeball brim hat. Horrifying. Hahaahahahahahahahah. Yeah, right. way ""you basically everything apart buying clothes retail going cinema gym"" lockdown? ""lockdown"" joke. I'm glad worked way did, certainly need stricter measures now. Yes absolutely agree. Seems like government also feels way thankfully. Asian countries *mandate* masks flu season. Every time life comes once. hope life experiences peak college. I‚Äôm terrified things won‚Äôt normal fall. I‚Äôll miss 2 full years. estimate many people become immune virus exposed, either case, unreported infection? kind open question whether look like cold whether eliminated. I'm kind fence... get life I'd guess former surprised totally eliminated either. time really look worse cold people going stop caring getting revaccinated.

The vaccines give something approaching sterilizing immunity least Pfizer raise possibility full elimination Maybe vaccine never developed Spanish Flu? mean way anything totally get it, least glad beginning college experience end. sister graduating May lost last year half college experience, sister lost half last year, cousin lost last year half high school. proms anything. 

Doesn't mean invalidated feeling way are, definitely still sucks. least still couple years left things better hopefully next school year! Vaccines aren‚Äôt tested interaction vaccines protect pathogens. also don‚Äôt know long natural immunity various forms covid last Instead saying ""it's possible"" like 5% chance say ""probably not"" let people peace mind. Jeez fucking people That's effect like minded people interact. Like interact Trump voters see liberal Democrats shows mean anything statistically whole country. Yes, understand that. point comment, though. bad nation‚Äôs morale

He's scientist, football cheerleader. like hearing bad news stop watching news. role make feel better. role inform. lot things... (I guess younger generations tend ü§î) ... they‚Äôre way ahead us I‚Äôm glad gives countries hope could looking forward success story Israel here, life back normal today; gyms, malls everything opened today. think 50% Israelis took first dose, finally pandemic Arguably. Yes probably didn‚Äôt much hands work, administration. thanking governors warp speed? That‚Äôs relevant thanking refrigerator repairman Canada fine! nurse friend already twins vaccinated elderly aunt vaccinated Monday. far province time administration told us turning corner November. administration 10% less wanted January. one right? recap, guy replying originally manufacturing capability first place""

Emphasis first place part.

To replied complaint bananas.

He quite clearly referring Canada‚Äôs failure existing pharmaceutical production facilities, long term issue. 

The argument Canada invested developing vaccine production facilities year ago functioning domestic biotech industry already pumping flu vaccines IPV something could rapidly retooled done world, rather starting scratch. Clarification please! California here- husband several preexisting conditions worst living donor one kidney later giving issues (however I‚Äôm happy report recipient made pandemic) anyway far know state guidelines next line, I‚Äôve making calls doctor clueless get list documentation needed. saying it‚Äôs turn simply show up, get shot it‚Äôs easy that? documents forms filled out? Oh yeah sorry, forgot Israel Pfizer manufacturing facility that. Bullshit. Fsicci knew. lying. said ""don't wear masks work preventing covid. Also, medical professionals need prevent getting covid.""

Instead telling us truth,and least wear something, lied undermined later message wearing masks. Gyih!! herd immunity crap needs stop. suggestion everybody protected nobody gets covid ever. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs going happen We're finally catching up...Canada 583, US 1 understand phobia wearing square inches cloth. USA, USA, USA!!! However Canada one-tenth population USA... can‚Äôt wait go back NYC. crazy. Got it. Thank True, although would take Eurostat statistics grain salt, knowing data reported.

My point was, far humanity turned morons children uneducated age 5 6. Double masking required low quality masks. fine people since people low quality masks well fitting n95 mask better needed. Anyone wearing p100 mask full face respirator double masked much better protection. pandemic response causing this. Fuck lockdowns fuck everyone pretending like give fuck suffering inflicted people. 3 Million people die every year malaria, virtue signalling people? Stay home save lives! lock house forever mosquitos wont bite you! People pathetic Vaccination Rates really go atm near future... happens people Start hating AZ live shadows. It‚Äôs empty. Graffiti. Can‚Äôt go get beer anything. People moving like city never seen before. It‚Äôs going get way worse improvement problem people think *themselves* risks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 20s, risk low‚Äù thinking led pandemic spreading. doesn‚Äôt stop you. don‚Äôt get choose spread to. doesn‚Äôt work like that. decided take risks catch means you‚Äôre taking risk family members, coworkers, people pass store street, medical personnel treat you. You‚Äôre gambling lives health too. obviously deep internal mental issues need help. mean look you. You‚Äôve post hours replying comments insensitive asshole also wants people feel bad time. already told another comment you‚Äôre trying play ‚ÄúI worse deserve angry take insecurities you‚Äù card. ironically you‚Äôre telling people suck you‚Äôre 29 can‚Äôt thing. It‚Äôs sad. pray you. South Africa first one think news, probably countries followed suit. fucking up. Canada alone bought 10x vaccines ever need. US, Europe Canada basically bought everything, nothing poor countries buy. 

The vaccines available ones China, Russia India decide donate. It‚Äôs unprecedented failure western world China Russia exploiting Max.  also account improperly-fitted masks leading fogged glasses (i.e. glasses wearers may likely wear tighter-fitting masks expel breath top masks fog glasses up)? statements contradictory all.

A large percentage people obey lockdowns US, little stop spread. number people obey future lockdowns drop. CA state might want try passport idea, governor already facing recall previous actions. political capital anything anymore.

However, enough people listened destroyed continue destroy businesses. Bars, restaurants, movie theaters, concert venues like we're hit especially hard mandated close government. businesses desperately need customers take every one get. never turn anyone away vaccinated. definitely positive situation country size city. Things get done quickly. Enjoy freedom! Meanwhile europe fucking W cuz guys probably hogging shit. fuck vaccine companies even doing. 1 month Biden President. Trump wasnt even able *test* many people daily. year plan this. mean quite literally territorial dispute well should, completely wrong. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessary move anywhere, support two state solution compromises sides situation Gaza really put idea hold least generation, unfortunately elected people zero interest Jews living part world leadership West Bank don‚Äôt power want waste time money? Sounds pretty stupid. basing calculation on? Death rate? Something tells USA paid way overpriced vaccines since possible short period time. Wahhhh meeeeee PLEASE Spread virus even throughout country though. concentrates heavily parts others. article details that. counties official infection rates 20-30%, estimates real number would push significantly higher. parts country going experiencing herd immunity. good portion people vaccinated good place see new variants effect vaccines current treatments. know caused lockdowns first place?

Stupid selfish people fucked make minor sacrifices ""oh kills old feeble lol"".

The lockdowns necessary. Bars, prom, college parties weren't.

Do civic duty. Shut man up. Yeah experience father 2 year old confirms small children spread germs like one else. 

But Belgium government, virologists doctors constantly pushing idea Children pass covid-19. 

But never test small children would even know? (it painful test understand testing young children feasible).

Also masking Children advised all. also strange children cough, hold back cover mouths...

But constant push media experts minimalize pandemic problems start:

* confirmed cases people infected Italian ski slopes even though villages next overflowing hospitals people cancel skiing trip Italy

First wave 10k dead (experts government surprised, ""no one could seen coming"")

Third wave?

http://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&amp;bid=0015&amp;list_no=712284&amp;act=view Let's clear.

Countries perfectly legitimate reason ensure domestic production capacity essentials - including steel, food, pure water, medicine, IT, etc.

Canada mocked us saying so, they're paying price domestic capacity mission-critical area.

Karma failed government failed policies. Hoarding? Na. everyone‚Äôs vaccinated, can‚Äôt claim people hoarding. It‚Äôs ol ‚Äúput oxygen mask helping person next you‚Äù situation. Casually highest hospital surge capacity quickest vaccination rates though. Japan here. think they've jabbed handful doctors. Im mid 30s couple kids shit demographic really feel terrible late teens/early 20s crowd. couple years high school really start buckling enter adulthood FUN maybe wild chance make memories last lifetime.  short time life I'm sorry taken away. 


I'm Canada locked feels like forever, see young folks hanging think ""good you"". Get enjoy lives. July, vaccination available general public several months, elderly vulnerable groups almost 100% vaccinated, hospitals deaths consistently sub-flu levels, mass uptake vaccine looks remain consistently high, time restrictions end, whether we're 40% 75% vaccinated.

If agree everything, including part, think conditions dropping restrictions right July unrealistic, different definition ""resembling normalcy""? me, distancing masks gone, we've moved way past ""resembling normalcy"". may TBD work left like getting low-risk groups like kids vaccinated international travel may back way, we're certainly way closer today. think herd immunity threshold gonna lower 70% vaccine blocks transmission? understand statistics. Baldness factor despite accounting CDC list risk factors scientific evidence. understand studies work think ONE study proves anything. truly factor would know now. Yeah quoted stuff another post, making distinction well.

The problem seems people actually listening Fauci saying. even past that, people assuming anything says meant hard deadline anything gets pushed back somehow malicious result logistics simply really difficult information time progresses. course unpredictable human factor whether people continue employ good practice.

It help clarify questions original post though, responding people here... people operating bad information strawman arguments - necessarily malicious intent, desire hard deadline _no one_ offer them. dark ages? AstraZeneca terrible trial, lack participants age groups, participants getting different doses, clusterfuck Switzerland dare approve it.

Besides that, rushed promise undeliverable orders, notifying EU they'd less 70 million vaccines 8 weeks deadline, claiming can't move stock UK.

Basically expecting government body, population, trust vaccine face mess?

EU given priority AZ, still time pull funding sue AZ - would best course action. Regarding mRNA, make much difference, there's stock AZ, that's BioNTech longer exclusively Pfizer, Sanofi pharmaceutical company making mRNA, worry, plenty vaccines. Took anyone whole day notice that. Shit. ""The newest timeline pushes stage back around four five months."" argument Faucis timelines always changing. could come every media network pick months hat pay much pay It‚Äôs case high expectations. either meet (roll vaccine effectively) (contain virus effectively).

Also worth noting shift political landscape containment vaccination periods. solution 7 billion people enter perpetual lockdowns that‚Äôll eradicate virus? Instead developing cure (vaccines), solution hunker years hope best? 

What fuck. like Fauci lot. trust says, fucking way world going thing. USA 3.8 times infection rate 2.6 times death rate per capita Canada has. Even people dying disproportionately people voted people mismanaged established milieu people care enough other's wellbeing expend smallest amount effort make tiniest sacrifice, get vulnerable populations, hold US' restrictions them. they're restricting exports vaccinating 18-year-olds we're still working folks 60's lack supply, feel like righteously indignant. increase daily low temperature means warmer, colder. Somewhat true, glasses also slide mask, annoying. It‚Äôs CNN media likes take words dramatize it. He‚Äôll say possible they‚Äôll scream sky falling dude isn‚Äôt lying ya it‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs saying WILL. Anytime Fauci piece always find video interview watch order really get he‚Äôs trying say test, [but Astrazeneca results symptomatic Data Israel shows Pfizer prevents asymptomatic infection well symptomatic infection. \*specific\* quote link believe contradicts poster said? Press X Doubt may better luck writing state's Governor Department Health. MMW lawsuit like gatekeeping one vax dose doubling others. I'd still like hear someone government. Lots experts saying might possible heard anyone actually charge. mean would take whatever probably still months till turn I'd def prefer BioNtech Moderna one possible would comforting know sure that's possible even initially get AZ JJ Lol, how's universal healthcare working ya üá®üá¶? No, don't. stop wearing it. know, nerds wear glasses, jocks don't. And, yes, I'm little high. Canadians, I‚Äôm sorry

As American, however, I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre starting get shit together dont dipshit since resounding information worldwide get vaccine side effects worth worrying Canadian, I'm glad want anything Vaccinne. might want look life currently New Zealand. Lockdowns perpetual people make personal sacrifice adhere them. People New Zealand go concerts, watch sporting event live, need wear mask daily basis. enjoying life like normal whole. 

Mental health suffers live restrictive world restaurants closed heavy restrictions, can't socialize openly freely. wear mask constantly wash sanitize hands constantly.

America perpetual state restricted life, causes mental health issues. New Zealand perpetual lockdowns, rare intermittent ones someone carries virus country. mental health fine mostly living life nornally, lot fewer restrictions life Americans do. 

The one spouting bullshit you. many Americans willing make personal sacrifice, everyone suffers even it. screwing things many selfishness. I'm beginning suspect one them. Fauci lost ‚ÄúWhen polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent,‚Äù Dr. Fauci, took first dose Moderna‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, told Times. ‚ÄúThen, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‚ÄòI nudge bit,‚Äô went 80, ‚ÄúWe need humility here,‚Äù added. ‚ÄúWe really don‚Äôt know real number is. think real range somewhere 70 90 percent. But, I‚Äôm going say 90 percent.‚Äù


He literally making different numbers based thinks people need hear. says April, June, ""fall"", Christmas, 2022, really mean? data based on?

He clearly trying manipulate people sticking lockdowns social distancing long possible version common good. also apparently oblivious enormous consequences lockdowns mental health, education, schools, businesses, jobs, homelessness, etc. keeps throwing dates distant future without reason justification. companies besides Pfizer make vaccines. Moderna took Warp Speed money No. getting closer. envision this? Gov't payouts best gotcha Instagram video someone wearing mask despite sneezing public? Or, keeps Covid-laden sneeze droplets contacting eyeballs absorbed thru optical mucosa. maybe both. Sniffles. 

Good know 500,000 dead tell come back it‚Äôs sniffles. think last update said ages 12-16 approved sometime Sept (aiming start school year) ages 5-11 approved mid next year. everyone get vaccine restrictions go (I‚Äôm talking packed stadiums masks)

but mean time ease restrictions ""boy sure look stupid expecting dick"" Read: America First imperialist attitude continues midst global pandemic

But hey, least country well I've seen far many ""they old/fat/we're gonna die anyway"" comments people. horrible. We're talking vaccines darling, please try keep ‚ÄúA year behind financial support‚Äù lol 

You absolutely idea you‚Äôre talking about, US unemployment payments double Canada people making 1k week unemployment US top people getting 2k cash. 

Canada didn‚Äôt shit compared US financially citizens otherwise Canada similar, Muslim nations political tide starting turn don‚Äôt see restrictions tolerated hospitalizations deaths fall almost nothing. always said ‚Äúsocial ending‚Äù pandemic ‚Äúmedical ending‚Äù. social ending may approaching rapidly us expected. don‚Äôt lot objective data suggest prevents spread. study Israel came today suggesting though, that‚Äôs surprising. Vaccines contain spread, don‚Äôt know certain ones do. then, since people don‚Äôt mask need maintain social distancing, people vaccinated. summer 2021, 2022. don‚Äôt need kids vaccinated drop restrictions. Thanks info. pandemic UK? Hard say. Based aggregation scientists say, enough people vaccinated risks much lower. science alone doesn‚Äôt give us answer‚Äîit‚Äôs question ethics risk, informed science. it‚Äôs easy decision. 

For myself, except required can‚Äôt get away it, I‚Äôm gonna stop everyone eligible vaccine 3 months‚Äîenough time schedule appt, get one, take effect. smaller private gatherings lose mask much sooner that. can‚Äôt tell do.

Fauci thinks 2022. F that. I‚Äôm getting rid mask summer happy keep wearing mask public long over. it‚Äôs showing it‚Äôs impact. New cases 39% 2 weeks. actual progress! recognized single vaccine shot provides almost much protection serious illness death two shots, teachers people general could vaccinated quickly. obsession providing second shot 3 4 weeks first public health disaster. vaccine hoarder ... selfish disrespectful. Canada one first countries Moderna 4th Pfizer--ahead Europe, produced. got much could every promising candidate soon could.  never going get people die. Stopping people getting badly sick stop pandemic. Thank intelligent post, it‚Äôs good defense current public health strategy I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôm still gonna go you‚Äôre saying, though, think serious flaws strategy.

It‚Äôs easy understand intuitively can‚Äôt let people vaccinated go without masks grocery stores. Obviously people would lie say they‚Äôd gotten hadn‚Äôt, idk would possibly design verification system. can‚Äôt Fauci colleagues say that? smoke mirrors ‚Äúit‚Äôs still unsafe you‚Äôve vaccinated,‚Äù conscious downplaying well vaccines transmission? aren‚Äôt rhetorical questions; answer don‚Äôt trust people behave responsibly without fear motivator. ‚ÄúVaccines don‚Äôt much‚Äù 2021 equivalent ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work‚Äù: noble lie told basis people knew truth, would supposedly behave problematic ways. unintended consequence increasing vaccine hesitancy.

So go here? going magical day, 9-15 months now, Fauci go TV proclaim Jake Tapper pandemic everyone feel free burn masks? Probably not. Instead, approach semi-mythical state called ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù we‚Äôve heard much about, Fauci experts continue advocate abundance caution, humility, restraint - they‚Äôll remind us Covid hasn‚Äôt eradicated, new mutations still appearing Congo wherever can‚Äôt let guard down. They‚Äôll point tens thousands year still dying Covid U.S., expect Americans realize normal flu season numbers? 

What fear current masking/distancing/barriers regime stays place we‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter safe sorry.‚Äù always cluster Covid cases somewhere world, spooky outbreak avian flu like happened Russia last week, another Ebola scare. try save many lives possible keeping many preventative measures long-term, it‚Äôll make life worth living. kind defeats whole purpose. Right. brought Asian mask mandates, me. Honestly, current government's fault. decades making, allowing multi national corporations buy biotech manufacturers shut down. happing two decades. ignoring NIH recommendation use double proline substitution hinge keep spike protein closed conformation
 
can explain this? sure Rio they‚Äôve started giving vaccines hospital staff seniors. words Churchill, Americans everything eventually right thing üá∫üá∏ glad got W states finally! silver lining guys lot time build logistics issues Americans bitching about. Every article past two months botched vaccine rollout, accessibility issues, drawbacks sticking closely various phases. 

Hopefully supply ramps local health officials rock rollout. Big numbers hard, giving people comparison helps people wrap heads around it.

What 500,000 people look like? people idea. comparable city death toll, gives people reasonable reference.

That‚Äôs goal. We're literally getting many died. people US currently immune due natural infections, vaccines. Chad United States vs virgin Canada demand sharply reduce suspect becomes endemic virus see. Best case scenario gone two years. bet life I'd say there's 30% chance happens given vaccines actually give better immunity natural immunity. 70% chance end endemic virus exists low levels developed countries higher levels developing countries can‚Äôt Fauci colleagues say that? 

I know - agree concern theirs, say so, may behavioral/blowback ramification unaware / considered. example maybe would turn political quickly basically came said variant ""we can't trust Americans aren‚Äôt rhetorical questions; answer don‚Äôt trust people behave responsibly without fear motivator. 

Probably true, know else appropriate _other_ fear: people careful, get Covid comes risk really nasty symptoms, cases death. else _would_ incentive take virus don‚Äôt much"" 2021 equivalent ""masks don‚Äôt work"": noble lie told basis people knew truth, would supposedly behave problematic ways. unintended consequence increasing vaccine hesitancy.

I can't find evidence Fauci saying either things. say vaccines much, masks work? I've seen say opposite.

I agree overall gist / concern stance would point couple fear current masking/distancing/barriers regime stays place we‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter safe sorry.‚Äù always cluster Covid cases somewhere world, spooky outbreak avian flu like happened Russia last week, another Ebola scare. try save many lives possible keeping many preventative measures long-term, it‚Äôll make life worth living. kind defeats whole purpose.

I see reason assume case, personally. Covid numbers low enough indistinguishable from, say, flu rates whatever (maybe even then), whatever reason still insistent restrictions good reason, think we'd see lot people flaunting rules _and fine_ because, well, rates low enough restrictions make sense anymore. Problem takes care scenario. right people open early, see huge waves lots people getting hurt, we're yet. said I've seen nothing suggest would continue uphold crazy restrictions Covid exists _somewhere_ world.

It's tradeoff life sucking lockdown vs. life sucking many people get hurt virus opening early. hard balancing act - know right cutoff would be. think want get many people vaccinated soon possible arrive much better estimates get people back normal life reasonable expectation risk management good practices without needing go hardcore masks whatnot. dad sent letter book appointment wait GP call. they're both. did. pandemic team plan, we've defense production act 70 years. covid, Trump sent best one frequently profiteers looking gut dismantle respective government agencies transition, killed pandemic team, even repeatedly tried defund emerging zoonotic virus surveillance teams. pandemic alternated nothing actively hindering pandemic response tell followers follow public health guidelines line pockets friends donors. fucking Patriots team plane go China pick n95s Massachusetts New York feds refusing help, cases confiscated shipments states. 

Of course using lesson prepared future would good, main problem lack preparedness. sabotage. That's meant. hesitancy want normal social activities even people vaccinated gathering vaccinated, dont understand. people mindset need feel comfortable again? zero covid?? anything help feel comfortable meantime?

It's hard get fucking bummed current mindset. know may change, they're waiting zero covid, may well accept particular friendships zoom call foreseeable future. Please, explain getting vaccine endangering vaccinated people. Explain I'm putting risk covid they're already immune. assuming covid deaths completely random. aren't.

The 30 year old died probably already pretty sick way unlikely live 55 years he/she get covid. disappointed get coronavirus emoji vaccine came out? ability make mRNA vaccines quickly now. wonder approval different virus would since Covid one approved. Israel special deal Pfizer. sharing lots medical data company. stories effectiveness infection death coming Israeli data. Trump laid groundwork getting vaccine record time. know eager rewrite history pretend otherwise, that's case. Biden office one month, entire vaccine supply big pharma gift wrapped day stepped office. kind money takes subsidize huge portion nation's workforce form monthly direct payments consistent supply drops population?

The US criticised paying ""stimulus"" payments. Rightly wrongly, didn't. chuck huge chunk money vaccine ""gamble"" put it. gamble paying off. hopefully excellent covid19 vaccine options future also improved brand new vax illnesses. Hope research boost vaccine efforts! You‚Äôre contagious 2 days show symptoms (if you‚Äôre symptomatic) 10 days that. According states dept health. Knowing bad things gotten parts U.S, I'm really glad things improving guys! I‚Äôd agree...if people didn‚Äôt remember first thing hear adjust. imagine months ‚Äúoh, herd immunity really meant...‚ÄùWe‚Äôve saying one thing January spontaneously describing idea entirely differently month later. It‚Äôs counterproductive 

We also local doctor parroting exactly whatever said nationally. Unfortunately, privilege privilege. going used implement world wide real time tracking global social credit score. We'll place Chinese less decade. Can't believe can't see going next... Can‚Äôt forget st Patrick‚Äôs day first bruh cares?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* provinces charge vaccine rollout, dude. 3-4x many vaccine doses way total population, let alone population receive vaccine. Pfizer fucked up, yeah, poorly-times upgrades done shipping rate we‚Äôll receiving September doses July. pa ne bi al recimo da je 100 soma je dosta small moderate rise cases India, Czechia, Hungary places. say bad thing. proof mRNA vaccines prevent spread, mask wearing still good thing, no?

Indeed, studies Israel showing noticeable **increase** infection single dose, know anti-bodies take days least appear. such, surely even proven mRNA vaccines prevent spread, prevent spread *immediately*. sub stroking Americans egos hard rn :DDD

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

jk seriously I'm glad vaccines getting distributed quickly noticed change behavior outside work? team vaccinated suddenly boss going trivia nights pub, another colleague went Vegas weekend. surprised they‚Äôre already ‚Äúnormal‚Äù-er things, especially since we‚Äôve really careful point. freshman pandemic hit unfortunately scholarships rely don‚Äôt allow gap year. truly wish could. really felt like getting element finding people hit. I‚Äôm depressed. USA population 328.2million
Canada 37.59million

So exactly big thing it?  sheltered enough never stressed bills rent 

That nowhere near universal. means got it, thanks  Yeah age group way disproportionately seen ""front lines"" well, yet totally f----- vaccine priority system. Many ""essential"" employees never even got much god-d------ thank whole mess, risked lives entire time come home NOTHING worth living for, tiny ray hope vaccine came, they're told ""nah, healthcare, people safely stayed home whole time? They're important vaccinate are. Get back line young wont kill you. (Just leave insurmountable debt sentance possibly ruin health life)"" mean even fauci admitted placing herd immunity low number ppl get discouraged take vaccine.... still gonna circulate, common cold whoever got vaccine. think social end pandemic come epidemiological end. government isn‚Äôt gonna able hold every American‚Äôs hand call shots every step way transition back, public opinion probably play role.

The ‚Äúreturn normal‚Äù likely gonna gradual combination people letting guard numbers show signs we‚Äôre approaching herd immunity, Biden pro-science governors deciding time move certain amount country vaccinated. feel terrible college kids going college virtually right well high school seniors high school virtually. 

I know personally met people consider closest friends due become friends college due people met became friends college. imagine shitty social life life whole would able meet people would become closest friends today due college done virtually.

I'd almost say what's point gap years college experience normalized. need education course also social interaction (of whatever degree suits you) make college fruitful. 

Virtual college seems like absolute shit. Fauci go fuck discarded decays produces like body mRNA produces uses discards every day probably right read this. Yeah Swine-09 nowhere near deadly COVID, effective drug treatment much quicker vaccine. 9/11 deaths weren‚Äôt contagious, although agree war stupid. again, World War One stupid too, isn‚Äôt good comparison pandemic either. didn‚Äôt zoom tech covid we‚Äôd much worse place right now. CP24?? since natural immunity Exactly. good thing US bad thing Canada?!

P.S. compare? We're short together time unite time brinkmanship!

February. pre-emptively getting upset friends want hang even June? know case? every single one friend's thoughts? room change mind all? know i'm next week let alone 3+ months lol turn, get god damn shots nice things too. exact situation here. Sucks much especially since I‚Äôm first family opportunity even accomplishments. parents dropped high school proper senior year proper start college we‚Äôre extremely important me. waited high school graduation years could walk front parents rejoice first graduate.

I destroyed depressed months realized things taken I‚Äôll live whole life knowing I‚Äôll never graduation, prom, actual freshman year college, etc. snatched me. there‚Äôs way reschedule things. They‚Äôre gone forever. Even Americans likely enjoy late twenties - early thirties, dont sweat it. 

I see moment. Im preaching you. Im aiming light hearted reassurance.

In 6 months shit lot better. get trump vaccine yet? hoping mine soon. qualms people dying, great, thank admitting lack humanity. 

You fly. lie.

Just get vaccine it‚Äôs turn go back absolute garbage human being. exactly.

So maybe blazing straight nuance listing pre-exosting conditions. Toss sepsis respiratory failure there. mean common co-morbidities cancer, one include?

Or maybe say things unhealthy people primarily ones dying study considering healthy long remaining lifespans.

When healthy 80 year old fairly rare. 85% 80+ year olds America least 1 pre-existing condition.

Your 80 year old hypertension? Yeah, he's average lifespan. healthy 80 year old? He's got higher lifespan SSA tables say.

Now, disagree totally here, see study sorts pre-existing conditions, ignoring old people US unhealthy shooting hip guesses life expectancy garbage. Fuck me...I didn‚Äôt think much impact feel like hunger insatiable That's also get protected :) lenses fog much (and nothing worked likely due coating them), go much wear mask crowded parks etc. cares Asia?
