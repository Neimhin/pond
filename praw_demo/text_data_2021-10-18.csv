It amazing appetite anything desire eat foods. Like hypnotized. Democrats anti-gun. They're anti-f****** stupidity guns. anti getting illegal guns. Texas open carry permit training, proves point. Stupidity guns. yes infection acts booster. Oh yes. looked photo, look 'dirt skinned' all. I'm also interested allied political party (said vote Obama) encourages kind racism anti-intellectualism.

These scientists telling people something bad coming them. people can't understand become afraid. So, obviously, let's kill people making us feel bad feel dumb happy again. 21 games 2 shots Pfizer first May second July. still got COVID symptoms mild (lost taste/smell). safe assume vaccines sort like seatbelts impact? 

It started fever rarely get 2.5 days ago. followed congested nose. Today, mostly feel fine except tend sleep still don‚Äôt sense smell/taste. told isolate October 25th. 

I‚Äôm already isolating room (basement) want tips stay mentally healthy quite draining me. Thank you. üíâ % yes. would be? pushing mandates, schools, otherwise. Regarding vaccination masking. people dropping like m************ flies texas. think medical professionals need vaccinated.

So yes burning question is, let unvaccinated healthcare practitioners take care wife trial breast cancer. think reasonable question ask.  outdoors safety fact affected breeze, that‚Äôs hurricane virus. try stay downwind people, windfall don‚Äôt smell booze breath. s/. two meter rule general rule.

Wow interesting, take day 2nd dose fatigue headache shoulder painful. 3rd shot like slightly sore arm way. Man, joke landed. didn't. have. anybody land one? potential! Indoors tricky, winter opening widows circulation air competes heating needs. Modern homes also air tight. Airtight save money today close call. Central air filters today deal virus pricy. technology feel upgrade might reach supported subsidized. Back days mother dust pollen allergies, dad built new house, installed central vacuums electric air filters (a glorified bug zapper). May tell new prophet Obiden. safer since always... mean can't get sick all, safer indoors long shot. Heh, I‚Äôm exact situation you.  vaccinated Pfizer ended sick Covid anyway 7 months afterwards. even need booster assume infection acts booster? Lol ask ended PHD? interested perspective, whole COVID thing makes want learn science lot depth. Fuck. already got Pfizer booster. possible get mix match later? immunocompromised want protection could give I‚Äôm afraid screwed me. got Pfizer booster. remarkable side effects. sore arm, little tired next day, minor muscle aches next day, temperature 99¬∞F (normal &lt;98.6).

If end needing boosters every 6-12mo, I‚Äôll go Moderna next time see data mix&amp;match; glad able get booster now. here. Second shot wasn‚Äôt fun, third shot Pfizer definitely worst me, terms side effects. absolutely useless better part day. Brought back memories last time flu, though sixteen hour span. Americans won‚Äôt go easy. I‚Äôd dare say likely immune.   Mic drop right there. fully vaccinated numbers seem rising slower single numbers? Ive seen others say UK tests lot countries, could explain case rate difference.
I think universal healthcare must make big difference death rate well (lots Americans probably scared go hospital due uninsured compare UK) cause test positive. don‚Äôt stake China travel so. won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs CDC myth busters section. Awesome, thanks! I‚Äôm New Zealand (Auckland) schools may start open soon. Realistically, risk putting 5- 12 year olds? 

(Over 12s vaccinated, vaccination mandatory school staff). point is, conditions traditionally lead big upticks normal respiratory viruses may cause covid run even rampant, give help?

&amp;#x200B;

(and many countries Asia wear masks flu season) Much safer indoors sure. Maybe beer effective transmission reducing agent?

Edit: I'm half joking, beer alcoholic &amp; acidic, soda acid, people scream, maybe mechanisms interfere transmission host new host. got J&amp;J back March. fly China Saturday morning. required PCR two IgM tests Thursday. went got mRNA shot tests, would screw test results prevent allowed fly out? Would waiting get shot test Thursday flying Saturday better still get tested upon arrival there?

(Obviously I'll ask doctor advice, turnaround fast news, already easy get appointment short-notice.) kind turn phrase idea selecting mix matching pairing two things Thank kind stranger indulging pointless rant üëç never wore masks flu season Sounds delicious friend highly recommend exercise getting consistent sleep routine even weekends. It‚Äôs done wonders energy levels makes sound fucking weird, we're trying get deadly pandemic without family members dying painfully Scentless, tasteless food appealing, too. that's true. comments. shrieking phantom enemies name one person upset cased explode football games. one person.

stop fucking oily disingenuous question whether Delta made difference, orders-of-magnitude higher viral load. apparently doesn't. third dose phizer brutal. 2 didnt affect nearly much weird bodies react. feel much less anxiety know got third dose worth feeling like shit week! Well first might wrong, implied might worth checking yourself.

But moreover, may moot point [the FDA going authorize mix &amp; match boosters able get one anywhere within next weeks hopefully! That's true suppose time vaccine evading variant emerged would take time develop new version well. long side effects last? So, Spring Break, there's like, beach stuff, there's lot stuff crowded bars hotels would generally indoors. Like, simply spending beach, way Sturges delightful motorcycle ride country. clear whether they'll recommend dose 4, interval be.

But FDA appears warming mix-and-match hopefully able try something Pfizer next time. 94% actual vaccination writing ""religion"" bar napkin, too. thought might die first shot, wondering covid prior didn‚Äôt know it. worst I‚Äôve ever felt life, absolutely horrible fever, could barely reach sip water, could think, sleep, move, skin pretty much green days there. knew pass honestly doubts one point there. wondering impact florida's delayed reporting, scroll section labeled deaths, click 7 day average understanding new variants aren‚Äôt going new version vaccine anytime soon due manufacturing collecting safety data such, rush since current versions fine, I‚Äôd go get now. got mine 6 months day second dose. Unexpectedly, side effects worst booster mine, still mild (headache, tired, feeling dead). absolutely understand going UK compared US.

Per capita daily cases UK 3 times higher US, daily deaths 2 times lower, number serious/critical cases 4 times lower. US, delta wave seems shape previous waves, current wave UK seems persistent.

Immunity seem explain difference. UK's vaccination rate 10 PPT higher US (66% vs, 56%), total reported cases bit lower. UK's total immunity probably bit higher US, drastically. Behavior seem explain either, every careless Brit careless Floridian Texan, i.e. seem huge across-the-board differences.

Can anyone explain like I'm five-year old going here? Cases, deaths, hospitalizations small increase past week, it‚Äôs similar weekly increases past two months overall trend stayed flat. It‚Äôs early tell trend breaking upward. People strata keep long grudges. I‚Äôm honestly interested long term consequence business siding red-meat types here. Yes, exactly. Gun control never taking away right bear arms. isn‚Äôt ‚Äúgun removal‚Äù it‚Äôs gun control. It‚Äôs controlling get guns careful access them.  like year later

i think we're going plenty opportunities tbh helps there‚Äôs numerical limit number fresh host bodies TLDR see studies show JJ + mRNA wonderful, want know mRNA + JJ works well? know McDonalds burger king promo ""mix match $5"", well mix two things, get two things. Ugh really? sucks. I'm San Mateo county.  yeah, i'm hoping nih study finish soon, decide. right i'm thinking getting 3rd dose moderna,(first two moderna) like year later J&amp;J Except current government. point say 'mix match' time? they're mixed, match!  wait, PM got work home decades?? unfair. vaccinated Pfizer seriously considering boosting J&amp;J opposed either mRNA vaccine.

There lots studies show boosting viral vector vaccine mRNA (heterologous boosting) enhanced benefits, I'm looking study showing inverse would similar benefits compared homologous mRNA boosting.  Oh wow genuinely thought gonna get upvoted ooooooof random. people affected repeatedly - friend mine severe flu symptoms (vomiting fever) 4 days first second dose. Meanwhile sore arm dehydration times. can't stop vaccinating rare debilitating cases, need improve vaccines (possibly dosage) become much rarer.  took ivermectin recovered 100% two days. horse paste like guys like say, incredibly safe commonly used anti-parasite humans. I'm pro vaccine, mandates letting us go back life normal remember reading weeks ago dr tam said would looking extensive safety data younger age groups. think we're expecting approved ‚Äî would great, I'm going believe see it. affect kids anyway üò™    COVID-19 booster shots may way -- it‚Äôs turn, you‚Äôll get extra dose original vaccine, one updated better match extra-contagious delta variant.   understand communities unfairly impacted COVID, equitable option necessarily best one? possible wider (and may blunt, whiter) distribution would provide bigger buffer better benefit population whole? purely intuitive needing focus efforts vaccinate people need protect? Thank You. ...because one last year, reason changing season. ""Big"" exaggeration since something like 85% people may immunity now, give vulnerable third doses prevent breakthrough hospitalizations.

In many parts country reproductive rates hovering around 1 lots mask wearing already. winter comes certainly expect cases rise nothing else changes. I.e., we're holding cases flat NPI's waiting vaccinations, things could get tough cities vaccinations (5-11 age group, third doses, etc) come.

In parts country (Florida) delta's pretty definitely over. parts still account nationwide cases bringing averaged numbers down.

Looking state cases high basically flat. Things could definitely go either way, lot people gaining immunity (possibly 0.5-1.5% week vaccinations infections) exactly cases started *really* sharply rising last year. think you‚Äôre part military you‚Äôve already accepted far bigger risks risk vaccine

Most members military risk injury combat So, ‚Äúfree range‚Äù event?  search ""Marele Alb"" youtube try find English captions (if are), see! released recently nr.1 trending Romania.  


Also explains church went 90% trust post 1989 (the revolution) 50% right now, problem 50% ... really loyal (basically obsessed) crestinopaths call them. Agree. Wasn‚Äôt intending dispute logistics primary cause.  Universal healthcare vs. for-profit healthcare.

People go doctor get screened treated illnesses earlier there‚Äôs significant individual cost barrier it. Less untreated/undiagnosed comorbidities=less severe cases. right everything said, still negate still spread vaccinated.  taking vaccine would guess.  Im boat right I'm ok this, Mpls PD fucked right around here, vaccine mandates get rid assholes I'm happy that.

This great silver lining pandemic. Stay basement double masked. Eventually life returning back normal without you.    don‚Äôt know certainty yet.  I'll eligible booster 21st. planning go get one I'm eligible (Pfizer), FDA approves mix match week, I'll probably specifically try find someone offering Moderna.

There nothing else done. order little off. It's:

This request helpful ideas convince someone get vaccinated.

My mother-in-law hell bent getting vaccinated. rather problematic because:

- lives country highest infection rates world right now. Patient triaging fact already. peak still weeks away.

- working kindergarten education, extremely high risk environment.

- close retirement age medical condition increasing risk even further.

- responsible teenager twenty years younger oldest sister.

- zero savings.

- facing dismissal work. Vaccination soon legally required education professionals, sanction dismissal.

Other circumstances really help either:

- much sane adult children abroad 2000 km away.

- speaking terms ex-husband. He's alcoholic ambition whatsoever taking care minor son.

- mother 82, sane, understandably keen meeting anyone unvaccinated.

- social circle limited almost exclusively ""christian"" sect member of.

- reason, even decided get vaccinated sect leader.

- getting completely lost facebook conspiration theories, point one daughters reported facebook account repeatedly deliberately spreading covid misinformation.

- distrustful mRNA vaccines.

I'd welcome ideas suggestions get issue partner's way. feel like inevitable pandemic wanes.

Yes, absolutely. reflection Society caring person believe science efforts curb health endangering pandemic quits job rather vaccinated. 12+ 77%.

Right, exactly said. gotten updated numbers weeks (that find), may actually passed 80% now.  think team mate already hate him, isnt guy threw clothes shower?

Then no-showed game Oh course. problem large number people acting like COVID numbers going big spikes places. "" study, team analyzed samples 110 children COVID-19 presented Massachusetts General Hospital urgent care clinics hospital.""

From article. One thing I've never really seen addressed ""immunocompromised people"" completely static group people. people congenital conditions (I assume word works regarding amputees), majority immunocompromised individuals ""transitory."" going cancer treatment organ transplants something effect.

So 3 years need organ transplant immunocompromised surely I'm going protected got several rounds shots prior happening whereas brother law started chemo weeks vaccine available body never chance develop immune response immune system ""fully operational.""

Or totally left field here?  one earlier delta plus never really got ground? article even says nothing worry probably I'm concerned yet either open new varients bound emerge. Like someone else said would take something substantial outpace original delta variant Yes called hero risk life save people quickly turn around instead act incredibly selfishly endanger patients lives.

Over 99% heroes still heroes. ones who've started trying kill patients, obviously, not. means continue acting like great hypocrisy though, know untroubled reality. mean, database says, pretty unreliable finding first date detection. I'd look current wave started growing 

Two main reasons know earliest date unreliable... 

1. People enter data wrong.  
2. variant classification system actually AI model automatically classify someone's genetic sequence upload it. model strictly obey rules mutations exist, instead uses data trained make guess. leads pervasive [low] error rate, huge impact identifying things first occurred. you‚Äôre making millions dollars know you‚Äôre paid based current coaching record - you‚Äôre never getting another contract even close based record - maybe, MAYBE, shut take vaccine (ph yeah might save life). 

He chose‚Ä¶poorly. Excellent. states require State approval too. corporate approval. sign paychecks? already have. legitimate medical exemptions allowed. Especially case healthcare, vaccine goes religious beliefs wrong line work. They'd nearly religious exemptions, given far loosely.

The *only* medical exemption allergy vaccine ingredients, rare they're common chemicals they'd already lot difficulty life. People chemo receive them. 

I'm sure anyone documented allergic mRNA vaccines J&amp;J. really medical exemptions people 1 mRNA shot reaction it. Squid game ripped Kaiji Liar Game don‚Äôt see anyone trying promote antivax propaganda. fact, vaccine certainly helps reduce severe disease. case, turned could hospital stay mere annoyance. don‚Äôt basic needs taken care health insurance requires employed large company paying ridiculous rates pocket (unless you‚Äôre living poverty). We‚Äôre developed country doesn‚Äôt provide basic need people. 

But glad football coaches get millionaires. Good society. first detected variant April 2020? right? It‚Äôs also worth mentioning he‚Äôs made roughly [$55 million career AY.4.2 believed slightly transmissible version Delta -- identified growth prevalence, rather knowledge mutations impactful. 

Its estimated ~10% advantage Delta. comparison, Delta ~60% advantage Alpha. 

AY.4.2 officially designated incorporated PANGO tools yet. view growth tracking mutations, here:  folks west ocean-- variant really spotted much outside Europe yet, grows slowly. likely continue European (but mostly UK) story.  
At current growth rates even become dominant UK sometime January.  WSU actually decently, school must absolutely begged get damn shot still refused. Word week two back going try submit religious exemption, there‚Äôs way job accommodations. gave shot head coaching job power 5 conference this, it‚Äôs going worth it. Came back bite ass Unfortunately vaccination prevent spread, witnessed countries 90+% vaccination rates still many cases‚ÄîSingapore, Israel. excellent case studies. 

The narrative vaccination eradicate spread false one. 

Vaccination primes body fight infection. Lol, they're probably worried NYT tracker looks *today*. 

Many states report last Monday (Columbus Day), instead added Monday's tests Tuesdays data. least Illinois report weekdays, instead three days worth cases Monday, four days worth Tuesday. made seven day average dip hard last Monday. one week later, last Tuesday today, extra *three days* worth cases seven day average. week, ""14 day change 7 day average"" show dramatic increase too, trough last week. another week later, drastic drop, measured last Tuesday's peak average. UV light ass protect Covid, Trump's recommendation.

That's makes weird facial expressions talking media. medical context, certainly. day day life, important going bathroom handling food, otherwise think overdo it. plenty microbes good us, necessary immune system function properly. although covid got vaccinated, lets look way:

the CDC says vaccinated people 10 times less likely get hospitalized , 1000% less likely. 1000% less likely chance getting hospitalized vaccine extremally rare side effects heck deal. (I agree 100% safe would say 99.9XXX% safe due risk adverse reactions).

according data posted COVID, infected people 13 fold less likelihood break infections vaccinated . would 13.08*10 = 130 fold less likely hospitalized already COVID 13000% less likely unvaxx/uninfected people.

Now lets say got COVID got vaccine vaccine adds 0.53 less likelihood getting infected (13.08*10 + 10*0.53) = 135.3 fold less likely hood getting hospitalized (13530% less likely)
(this per study) 

the difference 13000%(130 fold) 13530%(135.3 fold) 4% difference 530% raw.

is 4% better chance COVID vaccine really worth young healthy (who risk 0.0001% chance adverse reactions vaccine? ) think personal choice.   cares isn‚Äôt? still access public transportation. go places‚Ä¶..if feel risk doesn‚Äôt outweigh traveling, able make decision themselves. England biggest part UK? wonder sometimes headlines get released.   Again?  depends medical advances (which coming nicely) future variants. school, word yet whether next semester online person. that, requiring vaccinations masks tiniest burden possible nobody around seems mind them. school saves money going online environment better it, that's nice bit. went well last time... =( Can‚Äôt fix stupid 

Only hope someone numbs two four think ever felt TRUE medical exemption allowed, also believe truly exempt, would traveling like middle pandemic? meaningful number people?  I‚Äôm curious neighborhood live often leave neighborhood lmao.

I‚Äôve lived several different parts city known people personally killed gang violence. saw guy get shot face front Crocodile 6 corners years back, block got police taped someone getting stabbed death, I‚Äôve run cover saw kids waving guns kids SUV.

Here's lead Airlines scrapped plan put unvaccinated employees applied haven‚Äôt received religious medical exemption unpaid leave

Maybe plans super successful gofundme?   guess thinking delta substantial head start new ‚Äúdelta plus‚Äù variant unlikely gain substantial ground OG delta exhausts supply covid-naive people. Previous variants went dominate much larger contagiousness advantage predecessors.

Bottom line: Covid King Hill, delta plus could eventually knock OG delta peak, it‚Äôll comparatively long struggle throne, game may end gets chance win. Reddit post lots Data Delta death rate fully vaccinated lower common strains. afew months back findng thread little difficult. really seems kind number. 5% exemption, 1% gone. - like Europe Finland. original comment Finland I‚Äôm pro-vax people can‚Äôt get vaccinated due medical reasons? think allowed use bus, train, etc.  tried online another pharmacy state got J&amp;J would let book it

also research i've done said people lying kids' ages get kids vaccinated media calls Delta Plus. PANGO name AY.4.2  Yeah they're expensive legacies now. still advantage direct flights one airports vicinity. Delta puts everything Atlanta, time suck.   bunch spoiled? Pretty sure started spoiled, sometimes we're lucky pick completely rotten one basket. I'll reserve judgement see many employees still review Dec. 8 then.

Yeah pesky dying stretching hospital resources thin leading preventable deaths disorders diseases. 

Also ""heed"" immunity... that's new one. going around medical expert facebook groups started guy thinks aliens trying make gay?

So paid vacations again?

What take actually get rid guys? Would nice called something delta plus avoid confusion Yes surely get rid sanitation theatre still going many places. thought used care wasteful habits humans amount chemicals putting environment. sore arms Chicken pox covid though, diseases infection give lifelong immunity, much, want know case covid 19? studies say natural immunity either better vaccine immunity, long last, consistent mild well severe cases? people make argument taking vaccine infection good thing gives additional protection, surely true, even without vaccine case protected long?    got kids pediatrician, family flu shots. option you? well databases seem state state federal makes sense believed since prolly find anything checked. last time rebooted? mean, India said waves covid, know means, right????

New super variant!! live long enough see someone get shot.

That's uh... that's wild statement. long long enough? neither girlfriend ever seen anyone get shot, none friends ever mentioned it. /r/agedlikemilk something. Except less week later even milk spoiled fast. Great, long keep for? endgame less sick people live, healthy people. citizens protected. Numbers show UK citizens well protected.  It‚Äôs bad people never think is, it‚Äôs great. Like yeah probably won‚Äôt get shot, live long enough you‚Äôll see someone get shot. ""how would like keep job, shithead time?""

""that's gonna dawg."" body isnt anywhere near susceptible vaccine.

So moot point...

Covid isnt going eradicated. severity disease reduced controlled.  guess 5 players league actually vaccinated then.  thing is, government policy massive contributer this.

Things like (in part UK) positive covid case within classroom longer send rest class home require self isolate require tested. children classroom longer classified ""close contacts"". *Even sitting next child covid.* 

There also definitely attitude ""well we're double vaccinated even catch we'll fine"". correct: lower Case Fatality Rate Delta variant compared variants prove Delta variant less dangerous - fact shows success vaccinations UK.‚Äú unlikely happen, however reintroduction mask mandate public transport crowded indoor places like supermarkets would surely help easy sell public.  vaccines effective preventing hospitalisation serious illness. 

As said virus PTSD real thing hopefully people stressed positive test counts get it. I‚Äôm planning getting flu tdap together. side effects it? immune system sees transplanted organ foreign (which is, also happens critical job). immune system try destroy transplanted organ need continue prevent suppressing immune system. vaccine perfect, helps us get herd immunity safer manner.

That's keep responding me.

EDIT: Twice, actually. Nothing says ""I care"" like responding twice comment. Hilarious.   Trying understand sublineage lingo... AY.4 lumped B.617.2? separate way AY.1 AY.2 , tracker page yet US 7 identified cases far? thought latter, article says AY.4 accounts 70% sequenced cases across globe, thought B.617.2 still hella dominant everywhere, US. AY.4 part B.617? I'm confused now.  Interesting. know CDC really estimating previous infections. Almost 50% incredible  ""Our hours shorter sanitation.""

They shutting people's lives down, COVID also ACTUAL medical exemptions count one ever said exceptions.

Religious exemptions ignored good reason, aside medical exemption needs ACTUALLY TRUE.

For example DNA vaccines hurt lot immunocompromised individuals due outright risks outweighing benefits. 

But single vaccine, DNA vaccine like AZ/J&amp;J exempt from, MRNA vaccine reasoning.

The fact is: Since 5 different vaccines choose from, going effectively zero people medical exemption covers 5.

When mention natural immunity problem comes back exceptions.

We actually never actually cared grandpa dies. Lockdowns never meant protect you, friends. Yes messaging sucks protect core infrastructure like hospitals, supply lines liability businesses etc etc etc. cascade effect massive scope. 

Unlike vaccine, natural immunity may stronger wane time. verify natural immunity? get antibody test? PCR? Rapid?

There many companies tests, adds confusions layers logistics checking. 

The fact end day vaccines easier track verify known characteristics. 

I really wish could stop talking individual protection protecting others. feel good emotions use try reason people get protect ""Themselves"" ""Others"" end day that's actually drives decisions point vaccine general.

Vaccines protect public safety, includes functioning core infrastructure, court system riddled cases due liability, insurance premiums, supply shocks due countries struggling workers dying etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. 

When get muddled debate personal protection people try defend arguing care virus, care others, right. unfortunately frame things way gives people ability defend entire point really nothing individual person. 

Wrapping back exceptions, soon exceptions exist people delay, wait make bad decisions. Allowing exemptions ""Natural immunity"" means people unvaxxinated going rush get infected, adds cost us all. 

Want real reason vaccine mandates best even natural immunity better(Which is, cases, 6 months, wane, vaccine reboosts immunity to) easier manage.

That's it. Reduced level? I'm talking RT 1, pandemic contracting. many breakthrough infections keep RT 1, even highly vaccinated areas. look Israel. believe rep presenting info FDA boosters discussed. That's say actually R &lt; 1 times, that's due vaccine alone, still NPIs help that.

Again hope I'm making clear. RT unvaccinated roof, vaccines reduce significantly. 6 months going RT &lt; 1.

What's problem getting second dose? that's true, that's rhetoric proof. easy point finger unvaccinated say fault, hard really look problems determine things playing part (vaccines decreasing effectiveness example) Totally fair, takes types make world. well! someone else would outbid get coach.

Edit: stuck testing positive, cancelled flights. guess so. Still strange though. Oregon, right? mild Covid back January. Didn‚Äôt feel like two weeks. lasting effects see feel.

It‚Äôs really bad lax county that‚Äôs next strict county.  pandemic demonstrates start clarity ones ability live long healthy life America heavily dependent one's race, ethnicity, income level, neighborhood, disability immigration job status. new some, health crisis opened eyes.

Why Black Latino people less likely work jobs higher risk exposure COVID?

Why Black, Latino, Indigenous people less likely health insurance? Sick leave? Unemployment insurance?

Why pandemic killing Black, Latino, indigenous people rates far exceed rates white people?

RWJF believes strongly every person country deserves fair opportunity live healthiest life possible. it‚Äôs enough simply document disparities inequities; need put policies place achieve health equity long term. budget reconciliation measure Congress represents tremendous opportunity that.

Now much right worth you? want right? want people voluntarily get vaccinated? believe anyone said would force best way protect young kids Covid-19 ensure adults around fully vaccinated. CDC recommends everyone wear mask schools, regardless vaccination status; that‚Äôs one important steps take ensure kids safe--especially elementary schools, vast majority kids still young vaccinated--and increase chances schools stay open in-person learning. important kids get vaccines currently eligible, flu vaccine, reduce risk getting respiratory diseases. it‚Äôs important remind kids basic steps take every day--washing hands regularly, avoiding touching nose mouths, getting good sleep, eating healthy foods, physically active--to keep bodies healthy possible.

The CDC also recommends, areas high transmission, schools implement COVID testing programs students, teachers, staff. Hopefully, supply rapid tests continue increase schools adopt approach. one piece needed keep kids safe school. scary cult like people now.

And expect raise military grade weapons protect them? get vaccine, talk budget. Oh makes sense. Lol. many tests get .5% positivity rate 500,000 people? really sounds like posted wanting people upset, weren't. plan continued pretending people angry.

But stated: really promising news hope future events continue trend. think colder seasons another test. possible we'll need annual boosters COVID soon say certainty. current discussions around boosters show populations, level protection severe infection start decline time. pretty confusing picture right studies looking getting variety vaccines still underway company requested approval vaccines except boosters people received vaccines.

Auto mod suck, let real discussion happen instead erasing everybody's comments. That's right conclusion seroprevalence, observed symptomatic disease.

The authors go say ""Not symptomatic seroprevalence necessarily result infections occurring intervention; individuals may pre-existing infections become symptomatic...""

Later still, add, ""Additionally, look separately cloth surgical masks, find intervention led reduction COVID-like symptoms either mask type (p = 0.000 surgical, p = 0.048 cloth), effect size surgical mask villages 30-80% larger depending specification.""

So, again, surgical masks better, cloth masks significantly reduce number symptomatic COVID cases. important result showing although surgical masks superior, cloth masks still provide measure protection. Although, vastly inferior vaccination (surgical masks reduced symptomatic disease 13.6% cloth masks reduced 8.5%). Huh Yeah, bad evidence. large data set indicating Delta spread outdoors data whatsoever appreciated outdoor spread Delta? significant amount data essentially zero outdoor spread.

It's really tough desired application used similar Tamiflu anyone tests positive covid prescribed, can't really make argument used almost sure alternative death.

It's currently going UK schools like wildfire, parents kids fairly recently vaccinated, get sick. Yay! think NYC like 85% eligible people one dose. relieving.

2- i'm negative today's test, keep getting tested? pandemic never political issue always morality common sense issue.the world never beacon morality care fellow man gotten worse generation.this pandemic brought absolute worst humanity, people worried individual rights going worried neighbor.people better point choosing mom dad..brothers,sisters paying ultimate price it. bad get vaxxed...

Meathead, nope American, also either Canadian Canadian. Either part society not. people choose society.    vaccine hesitancy suddenly none

I think confidence numbers really helped removing hesitancy here. co-workers hesitant first, less took vaccine moment us work vaccinated became majority. worst day, awesome. First dose terribly sore arm days, second dose nothing, booster dose sore arm (worse normal flu shot sore much bearable first dose), sinus headache, fatigue. Woke symptoms day vaccine occurred 4pm day before, woke next day (sunday) almost gone, today (monday) totally gone. nothing terrible. Still could walk classes store, see friends, fun hang out, feeling little bit meh  94 new cases NZ ever recorded.

On plus side, 94 new cases record testament well NZ done course pandemic.

On negative side, two months lockdown Auckland, reproductive rate virus clearly 1.

On positive side again, we're track high vaccination rates we're heading summer, unlikely outbreak cause kind trouble countries faced. Good news Canadian Army want troops spreading COVD-19 allied soldiers like US Army British German Armies. exactly CDC says:

Worst case get booster somewhere got first shots rock. don‚Äôt use Facebook. I'm sure population density public transport use also factor.  Especially since declared bankruptcy Isn‚Äôt lying professional context called fraud? meta-analysis crappy studies magically create single quality study.

Look Israel: don‚Äôt accept shit. long smell/taste symptom come back? Plenty credible sources. stance dangerous steers people away effective treatment. good evening! people recover quickly COVID19.

Got link study Id like read it. ridiculous take. people love TV ones lying everything making things worse, force scientists literally dedicated lives public health saving others‚Äô lives give correct information publicly. Oh no.

Anyway.... don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs big deal loss jobs effects 1% people. concerned negative outcome mandate 99% job retention rate? say, asked, high risk job setting. Novavax available U.S.? I'm hesitant mRNA/DNA stuff proven either long-term effects, studied rectified. get technology around years, change reasoning regards studying longer periods time.

Novavax uses sub-unit protein strategy one HIGHEST efficacy rates (if highest), uses traditional methods deliver vaccine (even traditional adenovirus J&amp;J solution).

My question Novavax rollout? can't find anything web outside ""they plan Q4"". get tested? figured mandatory vaccinations military real thing, want say anything without concrete proof.

And yes, agree odd. get shot knows soldiers accept it, vaccine brought suddenly problem. Yeah that‚Äôs screwup. can‚Äôt keep sending much conflicting information 350,000,000 people rapid pace. masks early they‚Äôre vaccines. still don‚Äôt really know mostly-vaccinated population looks like. need wear masks hit certain percentage people vaccinated? vaccinated people currently need wear masks right now? herd immunity even cards anymore? J&amp;J March 2021 waiting this. Pretty sure I‚Äôm going hop Team Moderna soon approval comes üôÇ week gets approved, vaccination clinic every single school gym every day please. Let‚Äôs get 80% cohort first dose week. technical term heterologous prime boost. Mix match sounds friendlier somehow. Good WA WSU apply rules equally, even sports royalty. surprised even give option. 

We got many mandatory shots Army even tell us were. knows vaccinated against. 

It something could even question lined everyone basic. Expecting perfection variant losing battle. Even fully vaccinated population going see cases. Hospitalization death numbers important metrics. say that.

Literally time said data showed vaccinated people rarely spread unvaccinated still told wear masks.

At point say mask guidance changed vaccinated couldn‚Äôt catch virus. Staten Island continues highest transmission rate city, 130.63 per 100,000 people, Brooklyn comes close second 121.53 per 100,000 residents. Combined, two boroughs 23 53 communities across New York City less 60% population fully vaccinated.

The article would better titled ""Trendy Neighborhoods: Covid Numbers?"" Sounds like cold. 98.6 normally 98.2 barely fever all. 
 
If PCR negative, trust it. matter sketchy place Lmfao! That‚Äôs hood right there.  went London watch Jags vs Dolphins game Sunday. pubs PACKED people wearing masks (all staff stadium masked-up though - credit organisers handled 60K people flawlessly). London maskless places too.

It interesting see cases/deaths rise next days. maybe stats due factor rather people returning ""normal"". give city flexibility. city government's real goal bring police force compliance vaccine mandate. city would prefer reach goal without firing 4,500 officers time. 

We've enough large institutional employers U.S. go implementing vaccine mandates we're developing playbook it. far, Chicago right. They've clear process penalties noncompliance. follow process they've laid out, send people home unpaid suspension, people miss paycheck (suffer real consequences), get vaccinated. 

The new wrinkle Chicago applying disciplinary process rolling basis. want spread 4,500 officers go unpaid leave lose third force once. city feeling especially ruthless, they'll put known troublemakers first group fire examples rest noncompliant officers. Seeing city follow threat firing people also persuade officers get vaccinated. whole vaccination situation could‚Äôve lot easier instead threatening people force mandates people tell got get vaccinated it‚Äôs sake. Oh president media politicians calling people didn‚Äôt get vaccination killers harm community that‚Äôs going get people get shot worked? treat people nice instead calling names degrading would done much easier people get shot.  Anyone washable mask recommend day wear? Wore surgical mask today day, uncomfortable this? thought done due lack availability still case? tried shots, yes  ""Chicago lawmakers"" enact..... causes school outbreaks 5-11 age group. could change US-German Pfizer Biontech Vaccine used 5-11 year olds.

No one knew except  England don‚Äôt rarely see people wearing them, restrictions lifted life pre covid. Scotland &amp; Wales still restrictions require masks lot places though Joey Kocur Nope still there. :( Can't say going wrong :( *covid. said unvaccinated, think maybe that's typo, covid killing lots people though unfortunately I've tried nothing showing up. Community Option removed?  happening world. Children lost parents caregivers homeless. Sad. Right cue - UK concerns another delta reported biggest one-day Covid case increase 3 months new delta variant AY.4 S:Y145H mutation spike reaches 8% UK sequenced cases,‚Äù Dr. Gottlieb wrote. ‚ÄúWe need urgent research figure delta plus transmissible, partial immune delta subtype, known formally AY.4.2, reported 10-15% transmissible standard delta variant, early say certain whether causing spike cases immunology Imperial College London, Danny Altmann, told CNBC Monday subtype ‚Äúneeds monitored and, far possible, carefully delta dominant mutant several regions six months displaced variants, hope delta perhaps represented [the] peak mutation performance achievable virus. AY.4 may starting raise doubts assertion,‚Äù  Vaccines provide plenty protection. highly effective death hospitalization. people would finally get Covid Zero, isn‚Äôt happening, we‚Äôd much better place.

Case counts aren‚Äôt important really ignored highly vaccinated areas.  Ok thread click top r/coronavirus. 
That open main page. see top background blue purplish virus strands. right see three three dots, click add flair :) Nothing wrong abortion one. don‚Äôt mandatory masks.  That's felony. I'm also interested allied political party (said vote Obama) encourages kind racism anti-intellectualism.

Excuse me? Oh meant thought government requiring businesses certain number employees require vaccinations employees, certain businesses?   must something wrong can't find feature.    Anti maskers, anti-vaxxers...?  Lmfao asking genuine question? way article written focus vaxxed weird considering vast majority workers vaccinated.

BTW, general question. add flair I'm fully vaccinated? exactly US Educational System failed ***all us***... *not* FloriDUH (though they're often ""leading charge"").

^(no offense otherwise intelligent folks ""stuck"" there)  test could theoretically tell infected, even also vaccinated? words, distinguishes vaccine antibodies infection antibodies? cable TV streaming service called Netflix. also maybe look YouTube search term squid game look vids series :)

Edit: Freudian typo ü§≠ Absolutely - I'd suggest clapping workers well. Basically anyone helping keep healthcare system running.

You know, that's actually good point wrongly consider. 

A people Connecticut subreddit family work YNHH saying mostly food service janitorial staff POC affected. I'll repeat said anything, society need needs done decrease higher rates mistrust medicine health care lot minority communities. mistrust cost jobs personally, think that's sad thing around. cable aware game show. Romania seems problem, low trust politicians governmental organisations. even hardcore antivax 'western' sense however quick absorb antivax influences countries. 
 
There's deeply ingrained cultural aspect mistrust authorities explainable historic point view. 
 
It's shame people reject vaccines that. easy say 'well stupid' 'get it' something like that, misses least part point. important, attitude convince get vaccinated. Squid Game new series Netflix. contestants play games win whole lot cash. contestants debt large amounts games twist ;) can't say spoiling whole show :) I'm wondering decided regarding folks got Johnson Johnson vaccine? mixed/matched Pfizer Moderna? runs run shoot offense. died Warren moon retired. Nobody else success it. twenty seven million dollars debt I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs dead broke already They‚Äôll settle court hope don‚Äôt give idiot another dime. don‚Äôt think masking aircraft makes sense masking requirements anywhere else.

I think same, therefore - health authority government - advocate mask wearing high risk environment, indoors, public transport.

The issue places transmission is, still know people got infected. places know assume fraction total infection places, yet every industry, place claims ""it wasnt here"". Well transmission didnt happen places they? 

Recycling air.. HEPA filters, properly implemented exchanged whenever needed? Recycled air one problem: may reduce transmission infected person isle 1 caughts sit isle 20, wont good nieghbor. giving ""it's you"" routine? invented ""it's me"". 

Nobody tells me, anybody, me! Soon? Already differences shocking. Romania example terrible surge abysmal vaccination rates. Russia vaccination rate 30% 750k Covid deaths (although government says one third that, 750k excess death rate) also surging cases. Adios. don‚Äôt need people work force. People compassion others well shouldn‚Äôt place society begin with. Look age‚Ä¶  rate diabetes obesity Guam?

Obesity rate around 22% (also children) diabetes fourth cause death. 60% deaths Guam caused chronic diseases linked poor diet lifestyle patterns. diet early Chamorros, natives Guam Northern Marianas Islands, predominantly plant based included taro, yams, breadfruit, bananas, cassava, coconut, fish.

Yes, go back almost normal, totally, high risk areas still mitigation rules, like masks indoors, vaccination rate alone isnt high enough yet.

Additionally, critique dropped mask mandates flights equal zero covid. said want. Often people favor dropping nonpharmaceutical interventions claim opposition wants cases all, thats disingenious. surprised, stupid, inconsiderate mf government requirements vaccinations employees?

No, institutional policy announced back end June. Yeah good. think Venn diagram officers refusing vaccine opposing systemic policing changes treatment minorities? assuming clinicians. Keep mind hospitals also need facilities maintenance workers, cafeteria/food workers, etc. 

Also, lot low-level clinical jobs require anywhere couple months one year training, usually vocational school community college CNAs, PCTs, MAs, LPNs. populations make majority 'healthcare workers' health system, although little background science medicine like MDs, DOs, PAs, APRNs do. Coincidentally, populations also tend make vast majority 'healthcare workers' vaccine.

But like face masks, pooping public, wearing pants, get vaccinated safety *very few* affected. Got booster 10 days ago, flu tetanus shot yesterday.

Still going mask even haf cold two years. Lovin  Concentric circles. Grand parents vaccinated. teacher vaccinated.

Except 50 percent college football programs turn profit. big fallacy D1 football big moneymaker, programs absurdly expensive run. know. I'm person believes personal responsibility. I'm vaccine mandates, vaccine passports crap. 

I've responsible. stayed home knew could, I've wearing mask public spaces even it. Got vaccine, admittedly later should. I'm still careful despite comparatively low risk think woods. Yes, meet friends avoid unnecessary travel restaurants/bars, etc. I'm social conscious understand many people gone much trouble pandemic. understand poverty marginalization people. think governments acted obscure, abusive undemocratic ways time. 

But see videos like still believe people's responsibility call military force line-up everybody inject whatever bring disease semblance control? Sounds like it, yeah. 

The advisory meetings public, agency (FDA/CDC) decisions happen whenever agency feels like it, usually days meeting. 

A way think two agencies FDA sets *allowed* use drug/vaccine for, CDC issues guidelines *should* use it. 

Outside pandemic times, ACIP/CDC rec gets vaccines covered insurance, since insurance required cover recommended vaccines one people they're recommended for. important one, study submitted discussed VRBPAC last week.

TBH I'd surprised authorize *all* mix match combos let people go hog wild. language things I've read seemed indicate meeting focused getting boosters arms vulnerable 6mo+ J&amp;J Moderna people, Pfizer already tickmark next boosting vulnerable people. I'd put money keeping recommendations conservative week.

Clarification *think*, *hope*. I'm team Pfizer would love (legally) get Moderna boost next couple weeks plans November make little uneasy 6mo+ past initial jabs. would also happily take Pfizer boost came boost-before-Nov no-boost-before-Nov, though.  Imagine paying money fake card free vaccination.... settle court. settle outside court. going court, settling. WSU probably won't. god awful place coach pretty hard find suitable replacement good following promises rather making exemption him. still highest paid state employee work university. Ehh...

One year P5 head coach. 4 years G5 coach. ain't poor, exactly enough money I'd want squander away $12M contract. Latvian here: 

We many god damn vaccines even funny, primarily misinformation people unironically thinking they'll get chipped, 5G going track them, pandemic existing(this specific anti-vaxxing woman started singing thing pandemic memed hell beyond, time become somewhat ""chant"" occasional street protests), people thinking government giving people empty placebo doses (sadly) common cases above. hell hole doubt pandemic truly never end here.

Once full month lockdown announced, imagine lot death threats started going towards government.


TL;DR - Latvia filled absolute misinformed morons. Help.

This definitely vaccine backdoor way get fired without severance pay.

It's also second year job. Hawaii previously which, poverty wages anything approaching ""normal people"" salary, decidedly less currently making. Got Pfizer booster last week. felt like COVID practice run night. horrible, def COVID lite symptoms tired af.

I would rather actual Delta+  Handy chart. Thanks.     way low realize article cited 2009. much much worse now. lot speak Russian would exposed propaganda there. Why? death wish? tell everyone know vaccinated even it‚Äôs mandated, ppl still mask indoors  mean, variant discovered growing quickly. many variants growing quickly due coincidently non-advantage related reasons, one actually started getting lot talk experts, scientists, etc, media picked -- largely unlikely point growth coincidental. 

It features two mutations region traditionally seen impactful. One mutations happened variants studied-- studies found impact, likely coincidence. 
The mutation new unstained, again, region that's believed really impactful. 

But estinsted transmission advantage variant displaying 10%. Delta's advantage Alpha 60%.  
I've seen sentiment ""We know differently, growth advantage supports much differently"" 

That said, variant gained lot interest high level, UK committed investigating recent technical briefing. Hopefully able add details advantage comes from.  Especially facility people go sick. many, want go say - dentist - washes tools really hot water ? me.

Otherwise, suppose might become measure necessary stymie variants covered well enough existing immunity. Sure, highest paid state employee. negative reaction you.

NIL thing they've getting cash stipends like decade now.

And really indictment NFL NBA age limits rule. players whether wanted play amatuer league pro league, really issue get paid instead get way nicer facilities would otherwise expected players skill. difference may worth worrying about. Either way, boosters going majorly raise antibody levels, already know associates good protection.

The vaccine makers trying balance high levels protection also minimizing risk unnecessary side effects overdosing; right seems like done good job this.

We know studies, remember every study takes time. Better boosters already look reasonably good right now. antibodies likely fade (although probably longer time table now), T/B cell response won't. Whether need protection circulating antibodies depends many infected people around. Right they're still everywhere. covid becomes rare, make sense keep boosting antibodies. They're probably underpaid given much revenue bring in, difference revenue/booster money team well vs. team sucks.

Of course, part reason paid much players paid cost scholarship. Fuck around, find out. Time federal *pound ass* prison. ‚ÄúAt stage, experts think AY.4.2 likely take hold - time could well burn drop watch list.‚Äù

I've far experience nuances US health care system probably ever will.

Unlike you, I'm actually willing engage discussion subject rather calling people kids claiming moral superiority.   Good shit  relaxed attitude towards adult vaccinations general. instance, father (mid-60s) tetanus shot since college never taken flu vaccine. goes many acquaintances - flu, tick-borne encephalitis, tetanus - vaccinations taken occasionally ever. no, people think vaccines cause autism (I've never met anybody believed this), simply care.

P.S.

Ticks concern people like countryside recreation, they're likely vaccinated. Well escalated fast Yep pretty bad there. said us still care. Nope. Thought certain amount time received transplants.

So, yes, I'm little left field here. D1. may sell tickets, programs insanely expensive run.  guy sucks Explain problem consenting adults agreeing receive less market wages exchange better coaches, better facilities lot benefits outside dollars. much pro-business party. No, believe ever said that.

It's discussing something heavily linked federal poverty line, using word poverty refer something federal poverty line, better clear that.  EU. people protect people. point point risk low enough. way beyond point. time personal responsibility. feel best wear mask, means wear one. people family higher risk covid, mask. longer ask everybody around wear mask. way past time risk justified it. understand everybody's risk tolerance same. seeing risk tolerance much lower overwhelming majority people around you. Reflect that.  NCAA completely separated colleges turned another minor league sports organization. 

Colleges education idiots screaming full ride scholarships &lt; 1% NCAA student athletes actually get full rides.  programs cover flu shots. true kids get vaccinated people care surprised information, I‚Äôve Tesco saw one person mask on. vaccines work well people less robust immune systems kids can't get vaccinated.

Insane. experts ever said likely get situation almost nobody tests positive virus? Since vaccines reduce chances testing positive dont see possible.

Most people wlling wear masks kinds restrictions real end. people want protected serious illness live lives.

England's approach virus model rest world countries become mostly fully vaccinated. think describing something reasonable? 

Low case rates, high vaccinations virtual/masked campus?

What endgame scenario? Yes, face additional threat. big one.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Highest paid state employee... lot I'm sure. yea pretty sure (never tested positives, symptoms) mild COVID Feb., pretty bad long COVID. started feel better got JnJ ""booster"", reignited long COVID, mild lasted 6 days rather months COVID (I actually feel better b4 vax weird).

 feel pretty well protected now, probably wont taking JnJ boosters coming out.  I‚Äôm talking humanity though. Like sports part human culture forever  problem individual liberty argument can't exception argument person exception exempt everyone one required vaccinated, heck, let's extend masks well, situation one get vaccinated wear mask. guy ever heard taking one team? number positive tests matter. matters many people require hospitalisation die.

How many people figure would tested positive cold flu virus thing tested everyone symptoms them? death rate remains blessedly low still.

I mean, 120 people per day (The death rate's hanging around month so) 8% increase cause mortality. I'm sure painting blessedly low quite correct. death rate Delta fully vaccinated quite bit lower Covid variations. Even though transmisable.

So news article technically correct yet look Death data... important factor!   Fire Finally! start watching games again! Better yet, proud Cougar family again!

I'm happy parents, like mine, entrusted children's care WSU. I'm also happy spectators return games without dark cloud hanging heads. seem like starting see sunlight burn away clouds. Whelp southwest We're 18 months deep, reinfection panic never emerged.  ""Good enough"" subjective thing. Personally view wrong question. People survived COVID without lingering effects lucky. luckier still option hybrid immunity, best immunity.

Despite significantly less common infection, reinfection definitely possible definitely worse first time, including death. take safe, free vaccine greatly reduce risk?     point ridiculous, unvaccinated people allowed use buses, trains, planes... frankly think we're point needs mandated... getting fucking sick this. ran empathy anti vax crowd get miracle drug refuse take Facebook said it'll make magnetic. Fuck people. want participate society justice deserve. anti vax crowd least patriotic bunch anti American stains society seen life. trust FDA, politicians sides state, federal, local governments, trust scientists around world, trust military's commanding officers, trust doctors. Yet people happily take ivermectin Facebook memes said to. people genuinely live different reality. least point remove work places sane members society lower contact people finally move past virus.

Maybe point along way finally work people's resistance get socialized medicine, afford see therapy desperately need. like theory delta. makes sense especially fast happens, much contagious is... sux Delta really changed game us.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  agree. I‚Äôm pro vax reasoning tells body antibodies whether it‚Äôs natural immunity vaccine. 
I don‚Äôt disagree boosters though .. Eg. chicken pox kid 40 years ago booster probably. I‚Äôm sure studies done they‚Äôll able certain long natural immunity lasts covid. guess strong side caution.  went Ok. family took J &amp; J already contracted covid. people like us sort hybrid immunity, number antibodies main factor care about. immunity cells care occur long term cell memory avoiding hospitalization vent death.
 concur exactly saying. Safer how? country needs sports. Look happened COVID hit sports put hold. many asshats putting opinion shouldn‚Äôt be. Advise stop licking trolley handles Tesco.

In seriousness, they've got incredibly unlucky, probably speak doctor case immune disorder. worrisome. Everything normal except mask mandates live.  think one grosser things covid taught us......that people know properly wash hands.  lot unvaccinated US. much want argue cases matter, long killing people, matter. Liberty Counsel, filed lawsuit federal court Maine August, claimed representing 2,000 health care workers want forced vaccinated.

This group trying file class action federal mandate group military members defense contractors. 

Time start Liberty Counsel tracker.      No, that's quite happened.

If recovered get least one dose mRNA vaccine, good immunity.

It totally safe people recovered Covid-19. everywhere still high? Shouldnt NE least moderate level now? states 70% population fully vaccinated. Depends. work place several thousand visitors per day. I‚Äôve seen Lot young teenage kids washing hands well restrooms. they‚Äôve done year half becomes ingrained habit. 

And me, washed fairly often. it‚Äôs reflex wash hands walk house work/running errands never used that. hospitals overworked understaffed, yet somehow afford fire number people? makes sense everyone here? Interesting UK cases up, levels US per-capita basis.

But hospitalizations deaths seem holding steady lower levels equivalent numbers US. Ok, and? That's still 1.3% 100%, rather .3%. Huge difference, statistically. interesting Newsom's original vote percentage 60% elected, yet recall 62% voted ""No"" recall him. could say Elder made Newsom popular. 

But think Covid response surge deaths cases FL made difference. Californians like life living.  way less 98.7% survival rate people caught covid.    board mainly focused negatives 2 years... Good luck! sources agree, think messaging. 

Huge portions population think (and act like) we'd better every person country got covid survivors collectively move like nothing happened. Espousing studies groups would encourage future pandemic response fashion. Reinfections breakthrough infections, assuming natural infection less equivalent vaccination. feel we're flying blind right now. would love see breakdown day cases are. suspect ton reinfection breakthrough infections happening. think sooner later way spin either come better way stop infections (vaccines 2.0), use existing vaccines (boosters) keep antibody levels sky high.

It's nice hospitalization still great, can't control spread, small percentage large number still good amount people. mention vicious cycle end sight, eventually area curve going add lot dead fucking people.  I'm talking average daily cases 7 days. Looking cases individual days exercise futility especially places report weekly. words Jeff Tiedrich Twitter:

""Holy fucking shit, vaccine mandates causing teachers believe science quit, nurses believe medicine quit, cops believe public safety quit. I'm failing see downside this"" color-coding based two metrics: number new cases per 100,000 residents percentage coronavirus tests come back positive seven-day period. they'll never safer. Cuts shoplifting? least seems us. Fewer doors, plus number staff = eyes on/staff near customers. Good them!! Let's assume fibbing.... What's job? Thats big ""if"" though. even threat losing jobs changing peoples minds. Honestly that‚Äôs lot different day day life, important going bathroom handling food, otherwise think overdo it

but said said small addition. I‚Äôd say way even add suggestions would wash hands automatic set intervals set amount time. can't remember saw it, believe USA higher proportion 18s vaccinated do. us well, really badly.

Which important... cases secondary school kids. even controlled randomised clinical trials establish effectiveness.

I guess randomness getting tick bite poses difficulties need get 3 shots start with, booster every 3 years

Yeah, scheme complex. memory serves, something like: second shot month (or three?) first one, two weeks second shot immunized, dose year every three years afterwards.  Another thing. reminds beginning pandemic, March 12, exact, went restaurant friend unwind long shift grocery store. friend anxious asked waiter thought Covid would come state. reassured her, ‚Äúoh, don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôre wiping tables time‚Äù. mask. didn‚Äôt know Covid worked false sense security precautions took. Yet reason similar misconceptions still going rampant transition post vaccine world. would mean southern Europe, make omelette car's hood summer afternoon survive thanks air conditioning, many cases deaths UK, aren't.

1. Community transmission low 
2. Low community transmissions mean contract tracing viable therefore school outbreaks.
2. Schools still mandating masks
3. High vaccination rates due teachers mandated vaccinated.

The reality breakthrough infections high volume cases. Hospitalizations increase.

It‚Äôs matter time. Hospitalizations deaths always lag cases. Cases increasing.  NHL vaccine mandate technically breach contract, NHL contracts pretty hard break God. get vaccinated.

Ending pandemic protecting publics health important personal liberties right now.

No one wants submit vaccinations, proof testing, constant mask wearing. needs end, means ending pandemic first.  Since vaccines confer sterilizing immunity (complete protection even infection), said said literally almost every single virus/disease vaccinate against, history vaccination. vaccine confers sterilizing immunity I'm aware HPV vaccine. rest varying efficacy levels, result percentage even vaccinated capable becoming infected spreading whatever pathogen vaccine for. SARS-CoV-2 there's even around 1-2% vaccinated simply don't/can't produce immune response vaccine potential spread vectors. Unvaccinated BTW, least 10-20% population unable produce memory based immune responses even resolve infection, they're obviously much greater sources risk spread. point need entirely reduce risk spread population, need reduce odds great enough R value risk goes well enough effectively protect vast majority, removing endemic spread, ends pandemic. see, % point becoming difficult. Even we‚Äôre past 80% eligible, it‚Äôs long way herd immunity. think school doesn‚Äôt pay them? realise organ transplant patients take immunosuppressive drugs life right.

They're throwing tantrums whole pandemic.  Great. People taking hands..

Thanks much argument generally see people infection opt taking vaccine. current information natural immunity, really good, consistent reliable across different people, compared vaccine induced immunity, right? ha ha ha Apparently mine that, then.  Among 17,500 patients, 3,200 (or 18.5%) GI symptoms, common diarrhea caused intestinal infection, bleeding GI tract, malnutrition. researchers followed 715 patients release hospital, tracking long-term Three months release hospital, 60% subset suffered malnutrition still experiencing inability gain weight. Six months on, 56% patients still dealing chronic weight loss. timepoint, median malnutrition patient lost almost 18 pounds compared weight time entered Northwell study‚Äôs findings align Nichols‚Äô experience COVID-induced malnutrition, though pointed GI symptoms lasted 18 months -- much longer six months study tracked said persistent GI symptoms common among 10,000 members Body Politic‚Äôs COVID-19 support group.

Depends work.   Since takes like 6 months become cop, take disgruntled restatuarant workers, train them, give salary, bene's, early retirements etc.

The types cops willing this, likely type fired anyway (I know blanket statement exceptions - plenty 'punisher' symbol types getting shown door right now) vaccines treatments time things get better here. Sort related, trouble finding normal 50lb bags rice outset pandemic. Asian-American household, eat rice nearly every day, 50lb bags like two month supply. 

Everyone else? I‚Äôm wondering y‚Äôall giant bags rice? know don‚Äôt rice cookers don‚Äôt know cook rice stovetop well, much less eat rice often all. figure 50lb bag like lifetime supply American families. 

I figure it‚Äôs sitting next lifetime supply TP hand sanitizer people. Reinfection tests expensive need sequence virus original new case prove different one. unlikely overall population stats.

I see study coronavirus causes common cold reinfect every 1-2 years. Can't find though.

Instead, here's 2012 study shows respiratory coronavirus disproportionately kills lung cell types responsible creating future Elder definitely could won. needed minority votes win recall election conservatives far unified liberals. He‚Äôd snowballs chance hell normal election. Thankfully recall failed.  Every time see one articles check CDC map back orange.   exception states indoor/outdoor mask mandate, yes. think ignore federal government? Variant/genetic tracking shockingly bad throughout pandemic honest... 

If want keep track yourself, I'd recommend site: current AY designated variants US really expected transmissible far I've seen though. 
I think US also received less attention though classification efforts. 

ORF1b:1257V found 20% US cases really rare elsewhere world. growing across time US, qu@ickly AY.4.2 UK 

It'll probably designated someday, effort putting variant identification track!ing seriously disproportionate importance. tell, none people identified new variant last month US. Even guy trying get ORF1b mutation designated UD Switzerland.

(Sorry rant!) difference you‚Äôre spreading deadly virus people though potentially killing them. Except tying hospitals/doctors.

I know across pond, US lot elective surgeries/procedures hold cause enough beds/doctors handle them.

So mind, they're fucking themselves, they're fucking others too.  vaccinations UK Astra Zeneca shots, right? bit less effective Pfizer Moderna? talk mixing Pfizer Moderna shot booster like J&amp;J?

They‚Äôre also masking schools UK right?  dont think realize powerful police union is. bye bye Bongino Bye Felicia mutation gets bad, know I'll able hang on. I'm really reaching breaking point crap.

Has anybody got words encouragement beyond ""it'll pass"" ""be patient"" ""shut up""?  Bye bye actually strongly support teaching kids mindfulness happiness. However, also believe science. include numbers referenced terms increased protection recovered immunity vaccination? getting numbers?  Based considered talking mental health professional? I'm snarky, suffering talk someone. Ehhh, there's differences. protein sequence spike same, differences UTRs codons thenselves optimized bit differently could impact efficacy. Also lipids used vector same.

My wife sister almost magically pulled bootstraps quicksand youth, avoiding even trickier issues process. 

After years simmering problems, covid19 seems catalysed firm decision tonight. firmly decided stop trying protect mother decisions. now.

Any attention concentrated fifteen years old brother. able guide wise independent decision regarding covid vaccination life choices... New variant? Hmm... could exposing patients deadly disease (which scientifically proven likely vaccinated), could possibly undermine work hospital trying do? 

So soldier fighting war, want soldiers side careless carrying fire arms? know, walking around occasionally firing bunkers? Potentially killing fellow soldiers taking precautions? keeping next potentially harm good, hurting morale, injuring soldiers, liability? soldiers less likely help unit cohesion, seeing basic minimum keep fellow soldiers safe? 

I know want nurse puts illogical, unsubstantiated fears well being. also want people think world flat flying plane. want people think government group lizard people serving food. hate folks... trust think rationally take care family. 

But know what? worth it, people willing see reason going take time think illogical positions corrected random stranger on-line. likely waste another reasonable persons time... plan wearing mask indoors even when/if CDC says anymore.. Especially winter. wife flu late February 2020 never want feel like again. us around 30 still we're couch ridden 2 weeks month feel normal. Gaslight, Obstruct, Project. Accuse side guilty of. way deep red. I‚Äôm talking deaths, talking cases. ‚ÄúThis country‚Äù? 

Passionate support sports isn‚Äôt American thing. world imperfect.

Delta came India. Gamma LATAM. like poor people WANT poor super cold freezers around. Well best risk management getting vaccine. shows well: current situation great all, living effectively restrictions place anymore. sense bad, we're bit unsure winter bring. 

Our NHS perform well is. cannot cope high number covid cases winter. least without cancelling non urgent operations, accepting quite people going die waiting get treatment.

I think need give everyone boosters 6 months up, urge people careful winter. Particularly vulnerable covid, also vulnerable bad decisions (long A&amp;E waits + ambulances available go well drunken injuries).  Vaccines remain largely effective Delta. effective. DOJ said misrepresenting official seal U.S. agency, like CDC logo vaccine cards, could **violation federal law.** Violators could face five years prison $5,000 fine. What's going UK ? explains rise ? historical covid infection, want tested nucleocapsid proteins, spike. They're dedicated troll, incredibly stupid. can't tell anymore. Where's 84% come from? really close ballpark estimate one might make, done actual seroprevalence work?  1% means 1 100 chance. know 100 people? 1% death rate means one people dies. USA, 1 100 people means 3.3 million dead.  considering third dose definitely it. way verify well? live similar environment city. 

I mentally suffering stuck indefinite pandemic mindset absolutely one willing define sort endgame. Except again, misconception football programs profitable. pay coaches big money HOPE they‚Äôll 1/2 1/3 actually cover expenses. It‚Äôs like paying movie star $20 million dollars hopes it‚Äôll sell tickets. Sometimes still turn expensive bombs. Mentally suffering wearing mask? treadmill test last week mask. fine even asthma.

Culturally here, engaging outdoor activities big thing. People getting together parks, playing sports lounging beach, hiking, etc. People stuck homes. We're enclosing 40 people tiny classroom once. businesses open. solution? Stay home wear mask forever? know many kids negative outcomes covid? No, wait 6 months. risks kids small. parent concerned it, mask child keep home. personal responsibility. make sociopath.    convenient government. masks jobs music industry going lost due bungling reciprocal gig-work-arrangements Brussels.  Covid happened. going away. need society continue. means cases possibly higher deaths it. new risk part life. time risk covid decrease, cannot wait resume normal activities. Funny service people don‚Äôt realize getting vaccinated part protecting country.    Didn‚Äôt stop reporting COVID deaths last 100+ days?  simply entertainment, public school, private.

That painfully naive.

Public school not, still entertainment. public school selling entertainment pay coaches rest athletics. Coach's salary sponsored kids going school WSU tax money... enough! sponsored Television contracts school obtains selling rights show football games. Football *sometimes* basketball singular sports actually *generate* revenue schools. often fund rest entire athletic department. comes expense selling entertainment.  KIDS. Remember them? can't wait 6 months eligible get vaccinated, give fuck risks them, definition sociopath. I'm engaging more, obv sick.   According international misrepresentstive media. Sweden absolutely restrictions. also believe Australia military dictatorship? Since that's recent buzz internet Sweden hype died down. echo you, original comment finland Denmark, Sweden. Cool anecdote.   That‚Äôs lower expected sub? Death rates still rising, albeit slowly, sake people don‚Äôt think wearing mask shop unreasonable.   one people catch every cold that's around.

With delta variant taking around U.S., federal government updated masking guidelines fully vaccinated people last week.

So, what's level transmission live? Look county below. Fake internet points all, know, downvote you. many people get seriously ill UK reports 223 COVID-19 deaths, since March Yes, article new Delta variant Guardian today, say case load driven abysmal numbers teenagers vaccinated increase vaccination.

THAT‚ÄôS issue. People keep pointing football like keeping college athletic departments afloat opposite part- money pit.

Basketball actually far profitable. another article Guardian today, say vaccinating teenagers 3x less Scotland. kids spreading around, giving family members, leading even cases. say got get England's vaccination rate up, esp. among teenagers. ~~Protect and~~ Infect.
