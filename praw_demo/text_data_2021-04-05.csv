Lol US superpower, racist xenophobic immigration policy Ugh. Wish could sign something get kids vaccinated early. Hopefully cases drop dramatically summer. least could promote top-down marketing vaccine prominent imams. hate people say hardly feel it. felt clearly felt every shot I've ever too. land border wide open covid infected people drive right fail see forcing vaccinated people quarantine serves purpose all. over? school either open closed, though. binary policy choices associated this. politicians committed opening (even partially, restrictions) can’t admit public teachers parents die result. Politicians committed staying closed can’t admit public many children irreparably harmed result. ability nuanced conversation goes door politicians must justify decision. fair concern one much worth worrying about. say that, idiots giving virus vector mutate become something dangerous. fortunate far appears vaccines effective mutations, give long enough find mutation pass vaccines. article relates visas, ESTAs. Yes social media info still required latter level checks necessarily place. Literally impossible Yes kind take control exponential growth reach levels comparable winter. R value reduced due vaccinations doubling time much larger means would hard imagine spike happening fast enough 

A) outpace vaccinations and

B) outpace human behavior adjusting serious rise cases

We going half adult population vaccinated much time. environment virus rapidly spread. plain day clear going see hospitals get overwhelmed mass deaths level unfortunately saw winter. 

All even mentioning fact incredibly unlikely event cases rise level winter still result far less deaths vulnerable population immunity. 

I'm people careful. I'm okay saying crossed finish line yet. actually predict going see even worse wave spring seems far removed reality people going make behavior changes hoping for. It’s bit disingenuous take people disagreeing something “le epic offended tRiGgErEd!!!”

If people want start ignoring pandemic, fine, don’t surprised everyone condones it. Ah ok good hear everyone vaccine... what's point? 

because there's non negligible amount people refusing take want get locked society phone died one night. 

what???? way improve compliance. Schools, employers, travel. health information safe location systems already built privacy venues already require things.

There's need drag everyday life vaccine checks every business. get people vaccinated respiratory diseases go back #907 priority. anything, reddit's appetite seems aimed vindictively anti-vaxxers without considering lack access stores public spaces might affect tons people controversial legislature like might lead division without tangible benefit. millions individuals r0 controlling measures don’t work. 

Jesus Christ. covid causes clots much higher rate azn even data pans seems

plus covid causes lots bad shit too

and get vaccinated, point, covid find Several E Asia countries made doomsday plans SARS. big key success despite neighboring China Lol, literally said didn’t help would make worse back time saying critical healthcare workers. Walgreens also didn’t fill “return date” back CDC card. makes sense. No, mRNA cannot change DNA Everyone said seasonality isn’t factor though, it?

I think it’s ridiculous say restrictions anything year data show little nothing Again, consistent since providing good advice. leading epidemiologists trust more, that’s fine. doesn’t make sense say Fauci wrong wrong everything let’s ignore safety guidelines - lot people leap to. Canada going enforce vaccine requirement when/if borders reopen? Something like 51% vs 65% doesn’t strike great enough bother distinguishing race. American media obsessed needlessly viewing everything prism race. true. decided give younger people seniors. normal needle. Saw someone Twitter today saying going full capacity game wasn’t “bravery” (was response someone saying wish brave enough go one) instead “wisdom *civic responsibility*” Umm, even news. pretty much knew Well gotten first dose country considering changing guidelines probably also worried falling cracks. able get second dose? get different vaccine? going sent back line partial vaccination wait everyone else gets two doses get booster different shot?  read love neighbour get shot..

Got really confused second.. Southern Baptist Convention literally founded defend slavery defend segregation. Please get second dose directed, consult doctor questions may have. Pretty small thin anything argument MRNA vaccines change DNA? suspect cooky anti-vaxx propaganda?? mom 12-14 hours create rules, follow them! /s I’m 23% honest. Thats good hear appreciate it. SAGE said today vaccines good enough. Masks social distancing must continue, third wave likely hit UK soon (as already Europe). lifting sort restrictions really premature. Lockdown must go immediate future.  would consider vaccine passports normal societal activity pretty authoritarian, especially point want vaccinated full access. point people get vaccinated people want vaccinated, there's really one left protect, aside incredibly small amount people can't vaccinated contraindications (who likely already take precautions normal illnesses anyway).  


We need add tools government industry keep track population, alarming amount access already. contemplated getting tested bout sickness back august people telling pointless. don’t really care anymore considering I’m vaccinated first dose second 2 weeks, would’ve nice know actually thing. small goes fatty part arm/shoulder, like need find vein.

Close eyes hardly notice. wear masks gym working out. capacity limits far know.

Pubs outdoor seating April 12th. HOPE does.

I hope. Merely pointing President US said sees vaccine passport private business thing, government thing. Without federal governments backing, national vaccine passport go nowhere US. And? protests last year 0% vaccinated. spike either.

Anyone goes WrestleMania knows risks point. They’re allowed decide whether take risk. 2 week window due necessity immature B-cells T-cells mature multiply clones trained one specific antigen. take multiple days complete meantime, get infected mount poor defense virus consists non-specific activation innate immune system, end hurting process. That's major part reason people bad infections get severe lung damage. body hurts trying kill wondering people actually safe bad effects covid(not safe infection).

2 weeks last dose vaccine... get 1 done shot like J&amp;J 10-14 days later good protection increases time, 1 month according data. get moderna pfizer 2 weeks second dose. Anytime that, weaker defense advertised. 

I hope makes sense. well, california didnt reopen schools bill passed, uhhh 2020 ran different government obviously great things  really fucking hate needles, im going brave 29 year old boy get shots fellow man. big needle talking here? Depends guess. Half people actively eating wear masks here. Western WA. Arizona’s numbers terrible compared California’s.  big needle? Normal flu shot sized? [I think Hard feel bad people travelled pandemic, government basically pleading people stay home.

They get home, entry requirements eased, eventually. UK vaccinated share population accounts 99% COVID deaths - people 40 account 0.04% deaths - opening completely reasonable. doesn’t “out control exponential growth” major problem. I’ve said numerous times thread, start high rate infection, doesn’t take much get dangerous situation. 

It’s theory echoed CDC many top experts alike. haven’t crossed finish line yet seems like think have. vaccination numbers crammed throat every day taking toll. want do?

Wave patents whole world make vaccine instead go west Currently (slightly stuck) country national health care. database info prescriptions, firewalled according tier, easily add things like this. Anyone authorized check status. Super easy. Mine has. boss jumped last year, us working home. Every employee gotten covid able trace came from, one got coworker (yet). He's made point know filtration system, masks, anything else, something working. I'm surprised big oil producing country like Nigeria procure vaccinations. beer gardens great. table service one in, one system toilets. felt much safer went friends garden party. back vaccines too. justify garden party it’s much risk sitting beer garden. need close it. Spain's Prime Minister supposed give ""an important announcement regarding vaccination"" 1 hour 20 minutes. semi-renowned journalist said going doses coming think might speculating, case we'd know EU sources covid card definitely easiest. That's company doing. Downsizing smaller office space one wants go back office. sequel must flow Better ventilation / air quality schools workplaces useful future epidemics overall public health. Admitting viruses primarily airborne reduce need draconian measures future. Medical dogma led unreasonable focus social distancing handwashing. mind better hand hygiene - keeps coli listeria food. stuffing kids workers poorly poorly ventilated cramped rooms good thing, Covid not.  


Forcing people wear masks outdoors, shutting businesses activities risk transmission, etc. - that's due dogma viral transmission droplets only. sooner airborne viral transmission accepted, better. going help flu, zika kinds viruses. take nap every day place commute work. great. killed virus vaccine put newer mRNA tech might less worried one. Hi. link source? quite. Every surface touch basically scratch card prize covid instead £5k. Almost always get nothing. Covid spread easily via surfaces. impossible sometimes win prize! 

The point know touch pass you. Could first one, could millionth one. low eliminate risk using hand sanitiser touching gross stuff. 

Covid really spreads stale air that's already circulated ill people's lungs. Open window (better) go outside. know sarcastic, both.

That wasn’t conservative. tired angry time.

Same Fully vaccinated, get covid test leave green traffic light country. people anything come UK. Thats feel makes sense.

Otherwise travel industry collapse. understand governments worried variants keep negative covid test people need take fly. Windows Issue rate vaccination, lack vaccines eugenics obviously know means conflate eugenics... Always wanted Gibraltar, maybe year’s year. still need reach herd immunity avoid mutations variants could vaccine resistant. Fear getting poked. Get shot live fear. classes people?

Those social status due anti bodies don't.

Would supportive genetic passport? unethical idea that. ban people get flu vaccine going venues to? ban people HIV getting hair cut barber chance clippers cut them? forgetting cost living also goes down. paying rent/mortgage utilities insurance etc ahead less.

I taken pay cut go low cost living area. able save money fixed costs way lower. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

that's best joke heard since ""2 weeks lockdown flatten curve"" Well boris still telling people work home even though nearly lockdown Interesting. helped 18 people Ohio get appointments cvs, Walgreens, rite-aid. singe social security number needed.  sure that. Contact tracing looked good paper seemed confuse matters. don’t think badmouthed anyone. Nope, definitely happened. want say Tennessee, couldn’t tell sure.

Early on, people understanding guide wanting to.  Everywhere seen fast sudden increase numbers due variant. Ooo thank info. I'll definitely mention next time. Guarantee rest world apps USA held back willful idiots act like app hard use actual tech morons like parents think Facebook email thing. joke. Please tell aren’t school systems actually this. Agree oh honey uh.. two classes people? vaccine free United States people able ever get allergic.. used 4 weeks / 28 days Moderna Pfizer doses simply make scheduling / coordination second dose easier. 

I second Pfizer dose today 28 days first. Seriously. This. fair, don’t understand point. Arizona 7th worst numbers, California awful wave winter still better states. Flu vaccines use clinical trials patients intentionally infected virus though believe. invisible friend. expert epidemiologist wrong. Paywall scenario it’s 1:1 comparison. closer comparison would say you’re flipping coin 10 times coin’s head side progressively wears flip 10th time hit tails side weighs slightly more. 

It’s weird scenario that’s essentially 1 10,000 number means context part doesn’t make sense. Getting t-tested tomorrow find out.  aren’t male more? EU whole either though Poland. currently 2.3M vaccine doses waiting for... knows what. 3000 vaccinated yesterday. :/ vaccines currently used. EU get many deliveries April Q1. Really remarkable increase, math - you’ll see projection EU far fetched. absurde seeing number people thread advocate civil rights violation Secondhand vaccination? third medical workers? flip coin 10 times get heads every time? 50% chance? Australia New Zealand come mind. Plus countries restrictions. still negligible. Nobody touching hundreds contaminated surfaces month. change R0 contaminated surfaces statistically insignificant number.  I've heard people talk third wave hitting UK would it? 

\- wave Europe driven Kent variant already dominant first hit (allegedly).

(Reuters) - Moves bolster IMF’s emergency reserves could provide $44 billion needed vaccinate 70% population lower- middle-income countries end 2022, added cost rich countries, new Rockefeller Foundation report finds. sound good paper. fact sounds extremely alarming unethical. Americans somehow seemingly supportive idea covid passport extremely alarming least glad controversial idea Canada Trudeau opposed to.

Proof vaccination international travel, doctors, care givers that's fine necessary. say can't go grocery store, movie theatre, restaurant required vaccine massive civil rights violation creates two classes people special rights white blood cells have, treated lesser white blood cell have.

To say genetic makeup one group superior other, starts dabbling ungenics that's never good idea. perfectly sums describes thoughts corporate mindset. optics. sure includes production increase cited article not, [but Sweden expecting 8.7M doses prognosis holds, would translate 400M doses whole EU (not including doses already received Q1). dont think people middle ages  live life man.. fine  
What heart rate reaches hundred? I'm fine, mom high heart rate symptom. way minimise serious? Thanks, know AstraZeneca study, tho wonder much different compared mRNA vaccine. read exact article reason behind Canada's delay. mean seems fair enough hopefully work. asked Walgreens, told 21-48 days fine, call day 20 see available appointments next day.  Middle Ages?? Actually need proper studies give empirical data rather looks like someone put finger air said ""meh, 1 10,000"" I'm well aware problems mentioning. would actually argue communicating long term goals (which basically promising is) would helpful done more. expected deliveries Q1, Q2, Q3 known long time. Mid march started talk plan vaccinating beyond vaccination centers. actually clear communication capacity vaccination centers expected deliveries public could held accountable soon January plan event. Communicating September goal much promising, cowardly little done much more. Suicidal toughts often sympton depression correlation depressions suicides, means depressions mean suicides. Yeah. doctor prefers “physical distancing”. Also, offshored nearly manufacturing capabilities lowest-cost provider... cuz globalization resources anymore make masks home. yeah exactly. phrase ""1 10,000"" unqualified meaningless. four vaccine producers released commitments Q2 reason optimistic. 

One big question mark remains; J&amp;J manage pull promised - AZ shown us much reduced delivery potentially be. 

If assume J&amp;J manages deliver half committed quantities country like Netherlands enough doses fully vaccinate 80% adult population end July. **Explain Sides: Vaccine Passports**

Currently UK news filled talk Coronavirus '[Vaccine understanding form (probably) electronic certification shows person two Coronavirus inoculations, therefore demonstrating 'safe'/low risk enter venue (e.g. pub!) without infecting every person present. 

It seems [two distinct one saying passport good idea (e.g. allow life return kind normality), others saying bad idea (e.g. discriminate people can't/won't take vaccination). also appears *to me* Conservatives pro whilst Labour anti. 

Please someone ELI5 pros cons people passport? general, expect situation look like September timeline gave last March, 18 months, over? experience, Citi Field...thats ventilated ballpark. way wind whips concourses...holy crap. Doy Day! Fair point, additional proofs always welcome. least surprising news I’ve seen day said would disaster reopened. like Florida! Oh wait... People weren’t anyway, even international travel. 20% republicans surveyed said would likely get vaccinated trump urged to. solution: make deepfake trump tell supporters get vaccinated thought base-less fearmongering allowed sub?

Do evidence, reason believe horror fantasies likely? [Here's It’s BMI 25 weeks ~70%+ population already.

Expanding 16+ actually adding small portion remaining population. would smart thing do, least 70 million people smart. I'll curious South fares summer. That's saw spikes last year people tend stay inside due hot weather. then, probably enough vaccinated people limit spread would imagine gets worse, gets worse. I’m surprised gullible Trump‘s skeptics anything. According believe anything Sure, always good see theory confirmed real world. Well, venues without money then. medical information business' business. Privacy matters. Also, horrible policy re: nursing homes. NJ NY basically sent sick nursing home patients back nursing homes... definitely help them, since Israel's getting vaccines. 🇨🇳 It’s difficult it’s high demand combined fact NJ one first states open 16+ comorbidities (one BMI 30 smoking) made majority state eligible right bat. made hard 65+ get vaccines demand way outpaced supply NJ actually one lower rates 65+ vaccinated despite high overall rate vaccination. think basically governor wanted wait little longer completely opening one last push elderly group. think it’s clear appointments blown last week allowed governor make decision appointments starting stay open several hours rather open minutes like past. Sorry, meant say “if hospitalizations follow case trends.” 5% increase sucks still incredibly unlikely die, chances are, catching covid going public following guidelines. Community spread incredibly low compared winter. Interesting AF. Good stepping name science! lot indoor transmission vs outdoor transmission. People South likely stay indoors summer really hot, pumping AC...  got mine Florida mass vaccination site. required proof residency (so driver's license) QR code showing scheduled it. agree. I'm even less worried even San Francisco City/County dropped less restrictive tier. 

If SF opening up, that's *really* good sign.  help diseases spread air respiratory droplets, whatever remains covid. Hospitalization rates also down. Nope. second shot back January kind lazy week anyway, anticipating side effects, felt pretty normal. Arm barely hurt either. 

was totally worth it. Nice try, many white people always find reasons indignant stuff like this, avert eyes actual racism. pretend hurt headlines point anger 'wokeness' feels important pain seen lesser human color skin killed it. That's America still absurdly racist despite Civil War Civil Rights Obama etc. last gasp denial eventually run course. Good. fairness struggle get 50% random games. demand go 50% opening day did. dork lol buddy. Israel basically phase 4 study Covid-19 research.

""The new research answers question whether vaccinated people protect around resounding “yes.” looked medical data children — can’t yet receive vaccines — 223 Israeli communities, found widespread vaccination among local adults, less likely kids test positive.

“These results provide observational evidence vaccination protects individual vaccinees also provides cross-protection unvaccinated individuals community,” wrote researchers Technion-Israel Institute Technology Maccabi Healthcare Services."" time day appointment?

Couldn't hurt, early, might bother since know much extra they've got end day. I’m hearing particularly equitable...with rural areas low uptake certain urban areas access relocate quarantine island things safe normal. Can’t safe. save lives stay bunker rooms everything 100% safe again! That’s weird, Covid Christmas, got first Pfizer dose last Thursday, aside sore arm little stiffness joints, first shot breeze. Mormons evangelical Christians. barely even Christian. Sinovac AZ similar efficacy (65-83%) asymptomatic infection, 100% efficacy death/severe moderate disease.

In fact AZ vaccine abit worse since reported side effects Sinovac remember way back reading something Yemeni grave diggers putting way work ever even opening new plots land cemetery. yet checked worldometer like 20 Covid deaths something crazy like listed time Hospitalizations up. unfortunate truth people think group identity important defining characteristic. another study vaccine hesitancy read showed 20% republicans would likely get shot trump urged to, number half everyone else parents got doses zero side effects. Age 65 plus. knew looking one told got shots Har har even feel 1st shot all, 2nd one hurt tiny bit going in. Side effects shots relatively mild though. difference arm hurt much 2nd shot. Pain went arm, clavicle back, woke couple times much hurt! lasted day though. Laying heating pad gentle massage/stretching helped, drinking boatload water. really, REALLY, recommend drink much water can!  did, never knew. Got tested times year always negative. Never felt sick beyond typical cold winter (few days runny nose, congestion, back normal). 

So, it’s possible, dunno. worries me. Covid case different cold, I’ve heard vaccine hell short duration.  Clicks, basically. Blow bubbles straw glass water... Saw story Opera singers helping long Covid sufferers improve respiratory health Deutsche Welle DW News. Well I'll damned. cases finally go down, hospitalizations go up. 

This virus trolling us, swear. “Love neighbor” white “fuck around” honestly think skeptics gonna get shot $50?  find strange whenever hear people say things like ""How get X group do/stop Y"" group identity important defining characteristic everyone subset. Lots racists find statistics support predefined worldview pretty easy find way make statistic say something positive chosen ingroup(s) negative chosen outgroup(s). though? Like what's gonna happen I'm worried sure what. I’m saying maybe bad experience it. sons virtual learning consisted minimal school learning. ways kill time kids. guess don’t get schools couldn’t practice social distancing everywhere else was. hope Yeah, really like rewards wealthier areas making sure underserved areas get vaccinated. want economy open, incentivizes making sure people working economy protected. 

You see look appointments. Lots working class neighborhoods prioritized helps reduce spread likely work person, around others, etc... J&amp;J Warp Speed spent $12 Billion, sure much Biden spent since. husband literally said tonight, wouldn’t surprising there’s mutation occurs really could affect anyone 18. Nature wants. It’s tiny feel almost nothing. look away think learned spell “Mississippi” complete thought shot over. southern US basically didn’t get covid first wave March/April 2020. summer surge basically first wave Something something new variant. goalposts always moving.

That said, experiment certainly interesting. could be, talk studying that. said time enough clinical data make definitive conclusions matter. Alex Jones calling Worth who, specifically? Yes, noted skeptics religious people.  Got it, thanks correction. Hopefully vaccine provide covid protection life well. questionable advice. I’ve read sero test won’t come back positive vaccine way would infection. Something different types antibodies generated natural infection, versus crafted spike-neutralizing antibodies vaccine. I’m 29 first dose. I’m protect parents heart diseases due family history. 

Also, want go Italy visit family haven’t seen 19 years. That's literally describe celiac disease layman's terms so... also hallmark autoimmune disease. air filter reduced infection risk 40 50% compared classroom ventilation. 

Groundbreaking science here. got J&amp;J also get Moderna Pfizer well? DESERVED punished indiscretion might lead fewer flu cases deaths well. Weird question, could benefit getting multiple different vaccine types. example, Moderna Johnson Johnson target different pathways. Could benefit what? Look data. Kids much higher risk flu. ten times amount deaths sufferered amount economic damage. successful? places. Masks required schools Jesus couldn’t even go outside, period? look retail restaurants advertising “safe air” stuck light bulb HVAC. local diner comes mind, advertising customers eat “worry free” “state art germ killing HVAC.” fail massively quality life higher last 12 months? like many people died nordic countries Well done. province Canada haven’t even started vaccinating health professionals like dentists post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Why? I'm convinced cousin mature enough father I'm concerned seems like future wife problem child could potentially pulling cult? He's free make life choices I'm respecting letting without saying anything entitled opinion based information available me. literally divulged vaccination status public website world see, let scan barcode venue others community feel safer? late February cases India low relation country’s population. even remember statements India reaching herd immunity.

As vaccination progress India quite slow (less 70M doses delivered country 1.3B people), consider new variant spreads quickly? I’ve seen mentions Indian press got downvoted sub. I’m confused another post saw earlier said children don’t spread much adults do. I’m totally you. Never underestimate short memories biases corporate overlords. workers moving economic hub cities cheap locales expecting keep career trajectory...yeah ok tech company SF might consider someone remote Idaho top option. manager might want manage team distributed around etc. Studies different countries follow different protocol, cannot directly compared like that.

For example, Brazil tested primarily Healthcare high risk workers, yielded 50.7% efficacy asymptomatic infection, 78% mild symtoms, 100% moderate severe disease.

In Turkey, tested general public, concluded 83% efficacy asymptomatic infection 100% moderate severe disease. Cloth masks use since early 20th century literally three weeks official confirmation transmitted via droplets air printed CDC emergency preparedness document/guide tells make cotton/multulayered face masks brands/fabrics work best.

The US medical industry designed profit, handle crisis, mass illness fatalities despite research knowledge scientists security experts like went document. That's plan B ever put place, that's enough PPE frontline health workers cloth masks considered well crisis North America.

Local public health officials Ontario currently using executive orders close schools zero notice parents. That’s state we’re right now. Peel announced today schools closing tomorrow, Guelph announced closing Wednesday. 

As far I’m concerned, pandemic not, unelected public servants much power. Imagine finding can’t send kids school tomorrow someone never heard elected unilaterally passed law can’t repealed elected officials. mention, way things looking, going close absolutely everything.  percentage people decide get vaccinated free choice ok risk. absolutely ones business own. Vaccinated people protected. Get vaccine want it. get vaccine want it. get reconciliation numbers? Yeah I’m saying overdoses went way indicates pretty bad effect entire pandemic beyond COVID deaths. 

“Moving goalposts” fuck outta lol we’re talking people’s lives, keeping score thought mega commuter. LoL. still remember falling asleep train ride back. Ended Munich. sleep station platform return train.
Bummer never met there. Could shared commuter stories beer brats. (Of course free time would taken road) live state nonsense illegal. Easy, luck required.

No risk-taking required either, vaccinated. Covid-vaccinated people less risk Covid flu. gotten that, big school districts open beyond chaotic random days K-2 age group.

The parents kids haven't. Additionally, ignoring difference room people 8 hours play ground one. little while, concern vaccinated people (teachers) bringing COVID home, seems case (as confirmed CDC now).  entirely true. Parts Texas hit relatively hard March/April 2020, terms case positivity rate etc. Sure, massive hit places like New York had, least panhandle Texas, crazy spring. ??? report data lol speaking suicides. decrease 2020. seems like attempting move goal posts. first Pfizer dose similar. Fever, aches, chills, bad headache.... looking forward second since it’ll likely even worse, definitely worth it! really want paint one simple act malicious. It’s though. 

I’m really sure say here.  might imagining man... Allah protect virus anyways? mean die clearly right? disobey god? Im getting second shot sunday wont using app online data base.  fema card isnt good enough wont go venue.  know passports become conspiracy political dont like digital side them.  Allow use card issued wont go out.. Friendly neighborhood Zillenial here, getting second shot two weeks 😊 'Member Fauci said start thing masks useless could damage got people touching faces readjust them? article specifically covered this. 
In short, know, ends need it, one ready. million people share sentiment, lol, Jacinda even made specific mention upcoming season. Im thinking sometime around June/July gone. they? knows. everyone vaccine wants it, going much harder enforce So, data links. We’re embargoing vaccine? best communicated federal gov increase allocation denied. least Maryland returning favor DC residents. Perhaps, perhaps not. 

I'm still somewhat confused two doses az vaccine absolutely needed, whereas seemingly near identical j&amp;j vaccine requires single dose. 

I've yet find answer better ""we test one dose"" Kitsch ones affordable breathable. bought beginning pandemic, needless say, failed hell lighter test. I’ll start wearing I’m fully vaccinated. first year high school got sinus infection every 6 weeks. one day fire department got false alarm carbon monoxide detector. firefighters crawling around looking leak found mold growing ventilation system. school fixed sinus infections.

All say, knows many respiratory issues prevented solved money. honestly thought meant 4 shots Jesus seems like lynchpin religion, though. called ""Christ""ianity, all, I'd think covers everyone thinks Jesus God's chosen one. Leading example would stop wearing vaccinated tell people great stop wearing mask know whatever lying fine. complain manager. mention conference calls pants. simply can't put price that. Depends where. Kroger Indiana looked insurance card. even ID. Bro, done? find we'll glad started testing early. Fuck that, give one extra stem cells. Feeling fatigue part side effects vaccine. Assuming hospitalizations deaths go down, think they're going hard time enforcing outdoor mask mandates summer.

I think indoor mandates probably sticking around till least late fall, early winter. amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

That said, think flexibility stay. Yay I've lost plot here. Teachers school staff understandably wanted vaccines returning (public) schools. They've gotten that, big school districts open beyond chaotic random days K-2 age group.

Teachers need get back work. Right now, restricted state USA (California), kids go indoor restaurants, amusement parks, playgrounds, malls, church private schools. can't go schools pay for, public education? yeah known coming reopened school winter break, disgusting country disabling killing children purposes money propaganda Darn!

Maybe it’s “everyone” fear mongering, chosen news sources are? zero snark comment. ~~Damn it.~~ Oh, that's great! really need variant vaccine?   Fauci really winging lately. Considering rocky start masks, sorta wish somebody Covid spokesman little less on-the-fly advice. 100%. consistently conservative public statements see reason would different. 


Reality like late summer/early fall.  People still listen him? Still concept epidemic spread works. Got it. No... really?? EU wants immunize 70% adults end summer, -- depending demographics member state -- corresponds around 55-60% total population.

When targets US UK? hear ya. stop sanitizing groceries second dose vaccine February. still wash hands handling food meal preparation. mental load fear groceries completely gone now. think important aspect article people missing 1 10,000 chance experiencing infection touch /contaminated/ surface. vast vast majority surfaces daily life viable Covid viral particles, even did, chance development infection due contact 0.01%.

If parents teachers vaccinated, can't kids go back school? Maybe profit driven, certainly money driven.

There's huge motivation pressure get people back work, back spending money. It’s interesting timing Moderna Pfizer different. experience I’ve read, second shot one hits people hard, first shot might little none. J&amp;J almost guaranteed side effects. literally called said got results clinic started asking questions etc. everything. decided hang call Attorney confirmed legal. think cases start drop continued pace vaccination come alternate timeline? Yeah family fully vaccinated around time like planning going eat. QR code carry around vaccine card I'm fine that. keeps people safe that's cool me. It’s brand new virus, there’s way guess it’s spread based past viruses. need data support it.

Also arrogance comment astounding. think scientists working COVID never thought make hunk past diseases? say sucks bit understatement, many kids simply can't online learning especially little kids, high school kids missed year socializing, sports, dating, they'll never get back. Parents forced quit jobs stay home kids, kids mental health issues probably take years unwind derailed college prep, etc.

There definitely risk spreading also teachers seems easy mitigate. Like point, simply vaccinate teachers allow kids opt classes case risk home. Somehow conversation goes completely sideways know simple. vaccinate people contact kids. funny quickly people forget March April predicted CAT 5 hurricanes, cause ""impending"" doom.

Stalled progress face surging vaccination? ideal, certainly worst situation; even close. 74yo aunt, healthy horse, vaccinated mid-March.

Y’all probably still want everyone wear mask lol. stop...  getting ridiculous. think number hear educated guess, someone's guess 70% vs 80% based data.

We try get many people vaccinated possible since wonderfully efficacious vaccines uniformly non-severe side effects United States, maybe we'll see herd immunity develop around 80% maybe around 60%. We're sure yet. I'd agree, always point person cannot reduce physical impossibility; possible, opportunity, materials, effort, produce repeatable process safe safe hospital dealing known-infected patients safely.

The challenge lack opportunity materials, developing process major areas unmitigated risks. productive carefully remove difficult low risks ignore simpler high risks (or follow process consistently, carefully, continuous improvement) --but high risks eliminated mitigated, makes perfect sense continue threat profiles lower likelihood--especially consequences severe across risk levels. person reaches point truly wanted 100% safe you’d actually order grocery deliveries, ensure delivery person stays 6 feet away door leave groceries outside house least 72 hours. Anything else is, know, porous.

That did. delivery person left outside.

The things queued garage 3-4 days set plastic sheeting sprayed Isopropanol 70% (me wearing P100 respirator, goggles, reusable plastic safety suit, changing gloves handling items various stages decon). left outside usually around 90-120 minutes sides sprayed dry. (Plus special handling suit, clothes worn in-process, etc.) 

Nothing frozen almost cold foods (and already vegetarian) either purchased replaced shelf-stable alternative. Vegetables canned could survive quarantine garage.

For someone health conditions issue life death.

There lot people know ignored medium low risks control, buckled took infrequent high risk activities--and many became infected, severely, fatally. 

Some, really made angry, given opportunity believe owed avoid many risks employer made piss-poor decisions them; insufficient government support ""on-premises jobs unnecessary sustain life"" quit remain closed (owners employees basic income rent/mortgage freezes) full course vaccination, and/or government force/materials perform ""on-premises jobs necessary sustain life"" highest level safety (such mandatory curbside employees full PPE.) listening Michael Osterholm's podcast year said beginning likely airborne surface transmission probably huge factor.

I really recommend anyone wants know science saying right without politics.  1/3 country shot, young adults schedule appointments, it’s spring. Leronlimab helps prevent death 7 day moving average deaths 800 still trending downward.

Cases matter NEARLY much deaths, never come close peak given received vaccines far. always thing though violate HIPAA. get HIV reportable diseases. information protected, send like employee access without breaking glass justify why. one home town's health department could see got COVID, someone sake record keeping/disease tracking.

Idk password though I'm waiting Russian satellite sync GPS coordinates. United States coronavirus cases increased hitting low point late last month, states driving upward trend also hit hardest variants, according analysis data Helix, lab testing company.

The country’s vaccine rollout sped since first doses administered December, recently reaching rolling average three million doses per day. new U.S. cases trended steeply downward first quarter year, falling almost 80 percent mid-January end March.

But period, states also rolled back virus control measures, mobility data shows rise people socializing traveling. Amid this, more-contagious variants gaining foothold, new cases almost 20 percent higher lowest point March.

“It pretty complex situation, behavior changing, you’ve also got change virus time,” said Emily Martin, epidemiologist University Michigan School Public Health.

Cases states strong variant presence.

Michigan seen sharpest rise cases last weeks. B.1.1.7 — transmissible deadly variant coronavirus first discovered United Kingdom — may make around 70 percent state’s new cases, according Helix data.

The vaccines authorized United States effective B.1.1.7 variant significantly slow virus spread large share population vaccinated. experts estimate 70 90 percent population would need acquire resistance transmission would substantially slow. April 5, less 20 percent U.S. population fully vaccinated virus.

Regional variants also fueled spikes.

Several states Northeast also among country’s worst outbreaks now. Connecticut, New Jersey Pennsylvania, among others, experiencing marked rises case counts, labs identified B.1.1.7 variant large shares another variant, B.1.526.

The B.1.526 variant, first appeared New York City samples November, appears two forms: one mutation may help virus evade antibodies another may help bind tightly human cells.

The rapid spread B.1.526 variant, made 40 percent sequenced cases New York City mid-March, prompted officials say believe also could infectious strain, though say early tell whether results severe illness.

There enough genomic sequencing, resource-intensive process required discover case caused variant, certain exactly much B.1.526 spreading Northeast, available data indicates likely widespread.

Turns legal due state executive order. earning 8x old salary. Assume 70k Italy, thats 560k US. afford health plan Agreed. People sub rolled care home employees want get vaccinated, get tough grocery shoppers? Makes sense.

I think people wanting return normal cost wanting punish anti-vaxxers. Fair enough, that's way go it. vaccine, think advocate start living life normally also punishing don't. 

The reality time set up, COVID big threat anymore. Everyone access vaccines life ""choose risk level"" comes COVID.

Why introduce massive inconvenience daily lives something blip year regardless? require vaccines travel/work/school like always. really feel like able go grocery store phone died. Yep, exactly this. Lmao can't tell trolling. want full restrictions everyone vaccinated? Literally week ago mocked reddit repeatedly said connection proven beyond real doubt. read medical papers coming germany painted cases ncredibly rare specific type disease randomly appear 31 times people share one thing: AZ vaccine. statistically clear cause. identified protein vaccine likely triggers immune reaction. people STILL going around saying ""its safe"". I'm scientist upsets much. risk benefit high older people younger ones. safe alternative younger populations entirely unethical give unsafe vaccine. 

Of course 10 days reauthorized 20 something sister vaccine mid-march. awful experience severe reaction put ER non receding high fever. vaccine even causing clots right things give 50kg small woman. voluntarily put risk sage alternatives available. unconscionable. said high-risk vaccinated months, true statement.

I'm telling remaining people continue get vaccinated.

I'm saying yes people COVID restrictions can't enforced forever. Look protesting going Europe people following restrictions. understand virus care people want, (realistically) people going follow restrictions long, current vaccination rates, returning back normalcy? People scared liberals. would be, too, took said fox news seriously. Abbott pandering people voted him. I'm AZ trial US. getting headaches months luckily neuro symptoms. I'm going MRI Saturday rule blood clots (and scary things). hope God sinuses acting really bad AZ news worried. sarcastic absurdity position there's absolutely nothing worry about, terrible ban it. things fit usual pattern, we're move ""you're crazy conspiracy theorist, one wants that"" ""of course we're good"" without pause middle. even prompted several states regions reinstate lockdown like restrictions. blogger edtimes also taken look are: [Which States Lockdown, Travel care dumb people, seen evidence lifting mask mandates lead significant increase cases/complications/deaths. official now, interesting see plays out.

Hoping best understandably make people hesitant get it. could bet ass died given vaccine already ICU least infected expressed lack concern welfare others

Pointing people vaccinated mass expresses 'lack concern welfare others'?

No, looking things upset taking others. Which, stated, makes lovely person. So...let’s say someone else pushes line past you’re okay it. then? 18.1 million doses given... statistically significant problem, would know it. *yawn* example akin peanut allergy, would seen thousands deaths now. wait proof vaccines safe, rather assuming are. Shit got weird Parlor shut orange menace got banned Twitter. 28 days recommendation something like 42 days. You’ll fine. lol. People read titles run it. coin 100 times row it’s heads every time, odds it’s heads next time? 50% course.

Mr. Taleb bridge sell venue care whether body fight disease?

It's typhoid maries like get guests sick. getting J&amp;J tomorrow driving 2.5 hours it. reason worried getting sick drive back? either way think make it, maybe bring ibuprofen take? tested positive january mild symptoms Nice! peeped stats SC, kidding yeah dropped lot since Christmas. That's really awesome things gotten back normal feel  think important start focus hospitalizations deaths, cases. vulnerable vaccinated, far, far fewer serious illnesses deaths. virus people catch make sick, completely different ball game. live Philadelphia restaurants opened 25% capacity. Bars still aren’t able open. haven’t able “do want” year I’m tired it. want able go things fully vaccinated everything except covid. even eligible yet Unfortunately see going businesses fall require employees get vaccines mainly insurance companies raise premiums offer credit get certain percentage employees vaccinated. passport systems use now, also show card you’re state database get passport... Pretty much this, plus dont limit revenue net profits going enforce via government orders? True, receiving ~600k doses P/B end June thanks that. Although could've 2mil instead ordered 100% start opt cheaper Astra. knew Astra would fail uphold contracts miserably start? Can't really blame them, suppose.  seen single double blind study show blod clots cause vaccines.

What scientific community hiding?! Keep fear mongering 7 people UK approx 35 million 1st doses.
Rounded 5.3m people Denmark Thousands appointments available mass vaccination site next week. 

Awesome. went bar weekend great time. Everyone happy mood. wonderful. proud region happy everything going well. One word: memory. learn things longer repeated. Immune cells same. First dose blue print. Second dose practice session. vaccinated(J&amp;J) well got card without QR code. Must regional thing. might implemented first, weren’t driving force behind it. Fauci said initially backed masks public supply chain hospitals broken need get healthy first. started wrap hands around that, started rolling masking concept national level. thought vaccine stopped infection death ? think you’re entitled boss around? look further, still get exemptions California. sure states. aunt anti vax California cousin never got vaccinated I'm saying might demographic risk outweigh benefit greatly suggested. Especially considering comparing risk die someone already got infected Covid-19 someone getting vaccine. fair comparison would also incorporate get infected first place. ever driven car? There’s probably 1 10,000 chance hitting somebody, monster. country in? Clearly US, cuz isn’t single store around asking vaccine proof diseases cut 2g cell 😢 used little Motorola burner t9 brick phone years refused get smart phone. mind buying minutes! forced move modern era. going sad day man happens. least. forced share private data normal societal function pretty problematic.

I bad news credit scoring works. course reduces transmission extent never question I'm literally asking examples, trying hostile - I'm things seen drastically cut I'm genuinely curious. cases dropped still great live, perspective would helpful. there's places they're higher capacities without issue obviously I'd want know change perception. Exactly point. true. 5 states personal belief religious exemption whatsoever, here's list: California, Maine, Mississippi, New York, West Virginia. Doubtful. still acknowledge aerosol spread. Obviously. clarify, he’s also talking *vaccines*. interesting spin. 

Biden Fauci control wears masks, thus bad messaging forcing people wear masks. What? 

The issue everyone shouldn’t wearing masks. vaccinated free wear masks. 

The messaging error half country believes masks conspiracy democrats control populace. free flow information. people look data see vaccinated people don’t need wear masks. 

So confirms conspiracy head. mean, else Biden Fauci claiming everyone still wear masks data says otherwise. 

Selfishly, I’m scared I’m sick living right-wing country, poor messaging like get right wing country. shit sweep Trump2 right power. think liberal states data driven, hopeful looking cases, instead looking hospitalizations fatalities.

Governor Northam Virginia doctor think pretty good making decisions based data. Hopefully look strong trend hospitalizations getting certain level start open up. I'm aware requirements state. believe I'm lying, say so. bored, probably guess state I'm wrote, see reason including personal information thread already. absurd. Red Rocks, example, wide variety artists perform there. can't expect willfully tech illiterate classical music fans behave as, say, Ariana Grande fans. established venue would dare this. South Carolina?  don’t know exactly draw line, mandatory vaccinations “acceptable” side line. J&amp;J using Ad vector different spike. 1 person died due suspected bloodclots associated AZ. ever left house life? gave every 1 10,000 chance hurting somebody time day, you’d living plastic bubble. get want people internet know much good person absolutely morally pure one thing, simply logical way spend time. different said. thought first state one.

Thanks correction grossly unscientific way approach this, introducing completely new variable (compliance rate) conversation explain away data. really needs get attention. Fatalities always highly concentrated 15% population, point almost completely vaccinated. should, statistically, basically eliminate fatalities. saw Israel, fatalities fell 80-90% group vaccinated.

It's scary virus kill you. lot less scary can't kill you. enough vaccines would good thing. would cost lives short term enough vaccinate young people. Cry more, antivaxxer. That’s true public schools, exemptions 50 states. states make much difficult though! We’re also talking standard immunizations often one done shots. Covid likely need yearly boosters. 

Hospitals public schools won’t require covid vaccine FDA approved (and time probably won’t worth it). seems stupid nurses needing get vaccinated mandate sports game. It’s silly hardly wait Dave come cube spend hour telling fantasy football league great aunts gallbladder operations went /s nervous taking seriously enough.

Data difficult properly clean. large testing group people get ill. Properly determining illness related testing trivial slightest.

I get people want believe vaccines infallible ending crisis. still need use bit caution them. comment boils ""no, wrong"" without even providing reasoning.

School learning restaurants eating food. Like prove least could shortening line hid cave last year.

Ah one ""covid bad"" types. Makes sense. someone whose family deeply intertwined evangelical congregation around 500 say I’m surprised people know getting vaccinated aren’t mounting growing effort get anyone listen reject them. Even going far argue it’s healthier beneficial society get thing getting Covid old fashioned way.

At first anti mask background antivax, amplified antivaxx portion. doctors nurses vaccinated likely required wear mask times hospital property. get vaccinated soon you’re able to, losers, unless you’re medically exempt (immunocompromised) true. still think must extremely careful shrugging safety-standards comes medicine. standards exist reason, declaring luxury time respect makes me, least, uneasy. situation like must approached considered manner, experts considering. Nothing 100%. It’s minimizing risk eliminating it. can’t force injections people arms. Worry health live life, don’t cry others provide evidence support comments.

This headline. ""Man makes spurious claims evidence."" Anything distract awful handling electricity grid failure. also obvious reasons implemented air travel land travel.

What obvious reasons land-travelers trustworthy less dangerous air travelers? I'm article ""vaccinated snowbirds"". argument expensive mandatory quarantine unfair vaccinated people, people?

Good question. suppose argument would imposing $2,000 fine someone vaccinated seems counterproductive. Likewise someone negative covid tests pre-travel upon arrival could argued fine excessive.

My personal preference would mandatory strictly enforced home quarantine.

But ultimately, I'm Canadian. circus, monkeys. possible people hospitalized and/or died got infected shortly received vaccine. takes several weeks, month, build immunity.  entitled opinion. I'm opinion government needs step matter public health population demonstrated year they're incapable properly managing pandemic without told it. Legally infringe rights, though. Vaccines required many businesses employees customers. order ban policy COVID, overturn least century precedent. physical proximity involved sports. Never, ever, EVER ride moving vehicle. things dangerous. three people died, two died within three weeks completing vaccine, according Sutfin.

So two died almost certainly didn’t full immunity infected (I believe it’s average 14-21 days infection death - 2 7 days show symptoms infection, fatal cases it’s 14 days average first symptom death) He’s clearly talking Covid lmao vaccinated less 24 hours ago card QR code. state in? least, doesn’t every state let medical workers age get vaccine? Thanks. case, vaccine plus mask help much. Must UK variant, insane fast spreads. They'll blame wfh growing pains reason stop. Ignoring happened immediately pandemic. buddy mine's company using reason. Rangers fan, need enforce reduced capacity since team sucks anyways. newness stadium wears off, attendance drop. much watch team. simplification. used 100% correct meaning word ""additive"", pertains probabilities. next month, no. next year? Absolutely people easy.

I'm vaccinated I'd forge extras case lost it. God forbid wind blows vaccine card gutter can't go grocery shopping government gets around getting new one.

Also, I'm imagining potential abuse. lose card, lose life temporarily. think racist card checkers going confiscate black asian people's cards claiming they're fake inconvenience them?

You run tons problems like unless digitalize it. Then, run tons problems data/privacy digitalizing it. That’s better way phrasing it, thanks! went concert yesterday! Also rangers full capacity games. Clubs packed every night I’m SC there’s number events hosted. 1,000 people can't catch there's virus around catch. kinda' throws wrench negativity, though, it? No. no. utterly stupid. I've vaccinated. two weeks Friday. I'm going continue sitting home. would peer stupidity. I'm going gym Friday I'm going sit restaurant. Saturday may go town day trip. I've vaccinated. activities perfectly safe. graphed much people care virus, line steep negative slope moment. Ragweed pollen beat hell every spring summer. I'm still using flonase year I'm miserable. pfizer computer chips installed already. guess don’t (and never have) understood wearing mask big deal. 

I (and still have, now) problem wearing mask. understand easily spread devastating person unlucky and/or vulnerabilities Covid. understand wearing mask best way get society open reasonably safely also protecting people slowing spread much reasonably possible.

I still wear mask go places right now. wear mask place asks too... now.

But also understand fully vaccinated, odds acquiring disease passing individuals low longer board even wearing mask. If, opinion, risk still high, quickly become responsibility protect yourself, responsibility protect wearing mask. 

I'll fully vaccinated approximately 5 weeks. know everyone be, time HUGE majority people want vaccine fully vaccinated, even partially vaccinated. time quickly approaching end restrictions, vaccinations end virus's vector ruining people's lives. opinion; data shows. texas deserves better We're vaccinating 200k per day equal (per capita) 2M per day States, deliveries ramping faster ever... started slow we're OK now. past 3 weeks we've vaccinating 2nd fastest rate G20. 

What I'd really like see, rather donations American vaccines, allow companies start exporting around world order fulfill existing contracts. pandemic end control globally. 💯what happened second shot. pretty solid get reinfected, likely milder. Get vaccine still turbo boost immunity Republicans voters dumbest fucks too! :) citizens deem risks forego vaccination acceptable viewed ""heretics"" ""outcasts"" declining vaccination. 

Is stupid better word?  would assume so, arrive wear mask.

Then go home, take easy. read people going gym fine, later night knock early. expecting this. surprises there.

Is reason shortfall? Last heard due ""natural fluctuations vaccine supply"" would last end April, due 5 million doses India come us.

But seems supply reduced end July. different? Good luck! first? felt pretty awful night/day second dose. laid around binged movies. You’ll probably feel much better second day wouldn’t plan anything. One shitty weekend covid. know Demanding one immediately mom loved ones would hospital ventilation Imagine sovereign states time emergency able obtain vaccine patents speeding production. basically burning 8 hours day?

Not OP, that's basically work is? 14 states age restrictions place still. allow essential workers risk factors. yeah, 14 states healthy younger adult isn’t essential worker eligible. hopefully change soon! example. stuff die, eventually come around.  fine. like people take least hours feel shitty. went long walk park vaccine, issues.  say like negative, that's precisely love New Yorkers much. I've seen city take seriously, proven effective compared areas majority anti-maskers. Now, I'm pretty sure people ease masks majority population vaccinated, there's certainly nothing wrong wearing one time being. We're ALMOST woods would seem, quite yet. 

And course know transmission way lower outside, get point think silly would wear masks park, people vaccinated, seems like obvious move me. general, think New Yorkers took happened beginning seriously, refuse let ever get bad was. similar thing happened Los Angeles well. got hammered really bad early on, seemingly one took seriously, general attitude shifted time, things continue improve there. let know number never truly zero. get vaccinated still wear mask. think really matter randomized control trials back up. Sorry fearmongering? how? i'm vaccinated wont use digital passport. even debate many us wont use it. point american history required prove vaccine records leave house.  Youre nuts think government going give back power year.. Mostly frustrated elderly grandma uncles aunts poor health refuse get vaccine, conspiracies. course invited parties last year. responsible human. Yes it’s Internet- nothing conflicting drug working saving lives people walking away ICU 3 days getting Super interested see many J&amp;J get allocated next week.  Oh.... no. 

He longer President, far gone, still big force right's politics; dreaming think running President 2024.

Even decides want run again, absolutely going away, ""movement"" loyalists elect ""Trumpist"" politicians. What's current date information/belief post-infection immunity?

I'm 24 COVID January. Traveling Florida weekend curious.

I've read overwhelming majority studies done indicate natural immunity fair amount time. Especially based low reinfections been.  haven’t seen anything lead believe virus transmitting animal would harmful humans, would likely jump back over. fair also read proposal, may unreasonable. use word ""venues"" makes think include things like concerts, though.

I'm worried alienating anti-vaxxers. They're operating logical standpoint, there's point trying reason them. want get vaccines, one force to, they'll miss parts society made possible everyone else getting vaccine. Way ignore 10-30% people lingering symptoms infection. long Covid denier? 

It’s fatality rates. hospitalizations go people significantly increased chance lingering symptoms may drastic consequences health. 

We can’t stay locked ever don’t pretend aren’t considerations beyond fatality rate. given lack vaccines.   It’s right decision situation find in. 14 states still level age restrictions. guess OP since said 55+ (most states restricting using age 50 60) they’re lying. get proof vaccine? Took least 12 hours feel side effects.  people either reaction right away dont feel affects half day+ later 98% survival rate? easy getting gun. Since last group people list get get line vaccinated , yep everyone else valuable me. ask reward get ? problem cost makes sense. bring specifically harm here? see slightly annoying show something get venue lots places already require ID anyways enter alcohol involved.

As far know anything vaccine related free people far. many people (in texas especially) refusing vaccine likely never reach heard immunity OK.  awful news Chinese vaccines, adds skepticism them. read study, total loss neutralization gassing B1.135 quite shocking something echoed mRNA vaccines vaccines trialed South Africa (Novavax J&amp;J). 

This adds necessity distributing higher quality vaccines low income countries. Australia gone longer 2 weeks without outbreak managed control them. risk continues, though think weighed benefits. worker imagine manager made decision saying didn’t resources right change website.

That decision pretty shortsighted. think that’s mass sites, pharmacies county hospitals can’t start till 13th NOBODY saying anything feds implementing vaccine passports, scared-shitless Republicans live lives fear Imagine paranoid saying state live Reddit. Bruh  assume speed point even tripling rate (as implied statement) would still involve nearly 8 weeks catch UK now. Prefer vaccinated bare face Bane look. problem lot ""all nothing"" arguments math.

Take point scientific study released CDC shows 1.8% difference daily growth. classic case sounds tiny bother compounding it, right? math, see 1.8% daily increase means *doubling* every 38 days so.

Bad talking owe bookie. Worse talking human lives saved lost. future ex shithead. Like get it, get unexpectedly sick spread people live hard impractical completely isolate them, symptoms going exposing people? gross, selfish person.

Sorry deal this. Wishing quick recovery. I’ve gotten shots, denier, sweet assumption. I’m forfeiting liberty, power, privacy government government agency- give away don’t get back. Thought saw study suggesting pot smoking might actually reduce covid risks. remember details. Yeah works contact tracing forced quarantines hotel rooms, like East Asia. Plus maybe restrictions mass gatherings, especially indoor ones like churches. Japan kept corona control without lockdowns.

I'm much left (much left Democratic Party) think every lockdown since May completely useless. see data: Florida first lockdown none subsequent ones, they're worse anywhere else. time open convince household calm little?

They're convinced ton people test positive post-vaccine hunker number zero. 

They also keep shoving articles Boris Johnson's long haul symptoms face think everybody like let guard down.  say it’s wrong I’m talking annual tax drive car. states “sticker” back license plate proving paid annual tax 15% pop vaccinated. tickets booked end July I'm hopeful! EU supposed get much vaccines delivered April Q1 would shocking speed vaccinations speed up.   Yet 82 year old pop got 2nd shot date pushed back 2 weeks ago June. happens shit gets politicized. don’t need it. people aren’t getting vaccinated news availability plastered literally everywhere, isn’t people don’t know it. It’s don’t want it. don’t know vote. Many states fed cracking religious exemptions. Ugh like 5th circle hell people understanding someone joking. theater, like ""mask mandate"".

Just (virtually all) private businesses, Schools, cities still require masks; schools, universities, businesses etc. going require covid vaccines. sounds lot like contradiction. says clear link. EMA says established link. That’s contradiction. least jumped gun report ready, fuzzy facts. situations less ideal. overhyped covid would still think would useful viruses like cold. tough luck guess. really isn’t big issue. either participate today’s world stay home. It’s like sort stuff going required buy groceries stuff. It’s large gatherings. read article didn’t really answer question - mean “worried catching it?” Worry getting sick spreading it? I’m fully vaccinated, I’m worried sake catching it; it’s rare happen, I’m unlikely get sick do. still worried possibility spreading around haven’t gotten it, particularly students, young vaccinated yet. sense I’m still worried enough getting I’m taking precautions protect others. I’m certainly worried getting sick I’m less worried spreading it, wouldn’t say I’m worry free. scheduled first vaccine appointment week today 🙌

I'm goddamn excited pandemic anxiety finally go away little bit still. know plenty people around NYC heard difficult get appointment anywhere near them, they're waiting demand die even more. Personally okay spending hours refreshing websites get mine week ago, friends like ""let know walk pharmacy.""  Okay list driver licenses car registration that's wrong? think anyone able drive ""anything"" public roads?

And can't say punish say repeated drunk driving say revoking license? (since one first place wrong) prison fines? car tinderbox ready explode think way checking waiting accident since registrations needed? bad can't ban terrible energy infrastructure breaking shit. 

good way load test vaccine passport backend. Clear link causal link exactly thing. Massachusetts New Jersey two states sort cutoff age 55, talking one those, also *long* list exceptions people age.

So yeah, everyone know works home going need hold tight weeks, plenty people age 55 getting vaccinated state. Cool jets. nice.  people gullible, easily manipulated, subjected peer pressure, told lies.  might idiots traditional sense. Wow. actually came reading 5-6 articles local Google news stating EMA found causal link.
Would change match truth? Yet seen Team sports include basketball, ice hockey, track meets (not team per day indoor tracks cramped), volleyball, etc. indoor facilities treat vaccine evading variant inevitable ticking time bomb rather outside possibility somewhat worth considering. left aren’t already timeline, won’t need anything official, saying enough political pressure happen.

The one thing control vaccine supply, theory state hold use either carrot stick supply get comply (more vaccine move date less vaccine don’t). Agreed, CDC needs firm this. worst part guys know brother law crippled it.
, know sister works covid, tallying cases deaths every single day. yet still try argue. fucking facebook needs deleted. team gonna lose 100 games think we'll 80% 85% people 65 initiating vaccination within weeks, think it'll essentially flatten somewhere range. I'll *shocked* get 90% people 65 least one dose, obviously really to. That's risk demographic everyone group wants vaccine get one, we'll really good situation. I’m happy privilege relative youth good health. us fortunate. (That’s sounds glib it’s fact don’t mean passive aggressive) 

I concerned called “long Covid” , people get infected report persistent symptoms months infection. Reports vary 10%-30% infected patients describing long term issues range fatigue neurological issues persistent decreased respiratory function. 

It’s great don’t seem group facet pandemic come calculations? 

Because risk assessment real threat long Covid/persistent decreased respiratory function decimates quality life worse death certainly worse potential side effects mRNA vaccine admission isn’t evidence for. Removes restrictions business capacities, etc... still mandatory mask requirement.

So like, 50% open.  state child can’t even walk yet. Neurodevelopmentally isolation isn’t something process. it’s authoritarians do. take control, never let go. government long list “temporary” measures meant last couple years decades old it’s worth got 1st shot Moderna around 24 hours ago, went good walk after, feel slightly tired today. arm sore otherwise good I’m planning go run log work. State health officials say 246 fully vaccinated Michiganders contracted coronavirus January March, three died. ""These individuals positive test 14 days last dose vaccine series,"" said Lynn Sutfin, spokesperson state health 246 people may ultimately excluded state's tally vaccine breakthrough cases may earlier coronavirus infections still tested positive two weeks post immunization. ""These cases undergoing review determine meet (Centers Disease Control Prevention) criteria determination potential breakthrough, including absence positive antigen PCR test less 45 days prior post-vaccination positive test,"" Sutfin said. clearly situation specific. company spread Canada; half employees work remotely due nature job (field sales). normally worked 5 days week office, I'm back 2 days week over. We're productive, everyone working remotely. connections meaningful (i.e. interactions purpose) we're happier without 1.5-2 hours wasted commuting (I exercise eat better!). There's official calculator NL now. According I'll get jab mid-June. I'm curious - exactly think political motivation mask mandates are?

**My** point that, NY (per u/hairguynyc's comment chain), that, NY based experience, photo ID required confirm birthdate. sociological perspective lump orthodox Christianity Mormonism similar category really theological Christianity's attempts continue categorize monotheistic rather polytheistic interesting core question, gets pretty dicey try use qualifying test

Well, yes, Old Testament texts uncompromisingly monotheistic New Testament way posit persons Trinity *one essence*; three hypostases, yes, nothing indicate separate *ousia*. One ought make acquaintance Cappadocian Fathers understand square threeness Trinity oneness. needed giant council Nicaea clear question! 
Plenty Arian heresy branches disagreed it, clearly Christian social historical terms. 

Arianism's core claim Son created similar even distinct essence unbegotten Father, constituted godhead. mutual commitment monotheism, dispute uncreatedness Son. best monograph market *Retrieving Nicaea* Khaled Anatolios. yes, historical-sociological perspective, Arians Christian, also astoundingly orthodox comparison modern Evangelicals let alone plenty unquestionably Christian sects treat Mary saints exactly way polytheistic religions treat minor divinities. 

Well yes actually no, etc. getting one lol complicated super interesting philosophical topic terrible place draw line who's Christian.

From sociological perspective, maybe, we're talking inferences historical orthodoxy even well-documented heterodox sects, Mormon henotheism analogue. Plus there's many things Mormonism nothing orthodoxy. Anyway, let's get vaccine lol much better understand flu virus. Odds average child ok COVID, dice roll want take? hear rationale

There CDC report last year. Singing cause major mass spread events. real risk one performers infecting everyone they’re working concert, distance factor limit spread. Masks help some, given time involved set up/break down, would surprised masked private concert ended infecting multiple participants.

If they’re outdoors, help great deal. Indoors complicated, though. thing think public perception covid theater. 

The mask mandates could dropped May 1 we’d fine. states proven that.

I figure California last state drop mask mandates.  year ago would banned saying here. Make money fear. Well deserved loss last night. need jump animals. already there. came animals. pay attention started spreading human population. absolutely idea wide spread is. started looking started finding infected animals. also ""jump"" back transmissible animals humans. another mammal virus we've made sure every continent. least 50% population vaccinated? 1000 cases 100 deaths day?

Yeah, 16% Texas vaccinated. Yet take every day slightly higher mean point towards end times. 10% big underestimate many people got it. 10% people confirmed positive already. know many people (and studies proving this) every case got tested least 2-3 people get tested. probably safely assume least 33% rest population got COVID. calculations put around 73% immune. time every adult get vaccine, 12-16 Pfizer shot approved soon. beginning school year, least 80% immune. posts made sub. got mine morning. wife already appointment doctor Johns Hopkins. got kind scared seeing line, appointment line much shorter. Still side effects either. :) muh freedoms nonsense. agree.

It's unnecessary (as see here) doomed failure starts. worth giving civil liberties failure.

The time energy spent debating vaccine passport spent educating people instead. \#2 made irrelevant #1 right, even said it.

Claiming in-state tuition lot different considered qualified vaccine. I've seen lots reddit posts simply lying online form anything checked go get vaccine. get mail school address. Qualifying vaccine would much along lines qualifying get local library card qualifying discounted tuition tune 1000s dollars.

Who goes college another state literally never goes home entire enrollment? I'm sure say did, doubt it. lost mean restrictions? still indoor dining, stadium, gym capacity limits etc.. Even gave shots majority Americans *today* would still May 18th considered fully vaccinated (using 4 weeks Moderna vaccine, plus extra 2 weeks immune system respond fully). americans dont yellow book dont get this... Literally came say exact word Well 50% June 15, current pace is. I’m talking salaried workers collaborate daily

Collaboration entirely possible computer. can't make work well in-person, a) looking remote workers b) need learn/train staff use technology.

It's retail factory workers ""just task"" *can't* work remotely. Sure? past month, cases plateaued. Yes, masks still required everyone. know long vaccine work, showing work 6 months. need annual boosters? Semi-annual? sure, vaccine works atleast 6 months far! literally vaccine, still like idea vaccine passports. Keep reading. effective respiratory cells, hydroxychloroquine effective liver kidney cells. careful, man. Reddit. Every stance must nothing. It’s literally voluntary. offer fee reduction all, even something nominal? People given Michigan. downtown restaurants packed I’ve seen since 2019 counted 8 people wearing masks local Walmart running errand yesterday, I’ve seen since last summer.

So many dumb people it’s shameful. Where's everyone saying CA open 2022? covid...and never want get again..was pretty shitty. Im biased. mom same. She’s fully vaccinated still scared getting Covid. don’t know it’s going take convince her. effectively contact tracing, means waiting contact tracing ""prove"" connections, never convinced connections.

thanks. Thank you! add, wearing glasses, wearing hearing aids, spin general sweating them. annoying others. least trying minimize it.  likely (some) people need wear masks large fraction world population vaccinated. Less annoying masks likely actually worn. currently arguing friend who’s worried someone getting j&amp;j “it’s 50% effective”. need better job educating people vaccines, lol Lowest day vaccines administered since feb 23rd US but.... highest day ever, lot, vaccines distributed, +11.3M beating previous monday record 2.5M! 

The US 50.6M unused doses, gotta get 4M/day average. called idiot. Why? understand certainly trying imply that. fact approved yet, developed astonishingly quick, etc really gave pause able read enough comfortable it. may case awhile judge completely different. Causal link means AZ vaccine causes clotting, EMA deny. moment correlation imply causation. reached point say AZ vaccine definite cause clotting instead another factor.

That different saying causal link, i.e. AZ caused blood clots, know EMA 'official' quoted earlier said.

The classic example statistics sales ice cream sunglasses correlated imply selling ice cream causes sunglasses sold. real causal link weather. “The state will, however, keep place mask mandate foreseeable future, limits large indoor events conventions 5,000 people least fall.”

Not real reopening masks mandates capacity limitations end. stickler go forever (in CA, least) people don’t demand end.

Ya know Reddit made millions people varying opinions everything right?  rare opportunity Science/Church tag team match blew OH fully vaccinated already Yup, Newsom twitter yesterday encouraging people go Dodger Stadium get doses, apparently thousands lying around. hope that's sign LA expand eligibility everyone sooner 15th. hell saying almost January? good news, encounter Covid-19, body absolutely destroy it.  gonna least another year there's vaccine under-12s. Masks schools thing yet. 

Plus, pandemics. [For example, there's currently major avian flu outbreak Japan South would world without pandemic travel restrictions, is, disease confirmed Russia, China, India.

Better face masks useful invention long COVID-19 pandemic over. Vaccine tourism already happening wealthier Mexican citizens traveling US receive vaccine.  anti-vaxxer person prolonging misery pandemic.  worst worst.  no, shed tear able go concerts handful states.  punishment exclusion society far severe. Well, substance story. Slovakia going real political turmoil. getting impression made political reasons, course I'm speculating. Still, that's opinion. actually saying different hilarious. reddit get downvoted optimistic. like people want wear masks forever frail mental status. Deaths usually lag 1-2 weeks. simply case deaths lagging cases, would seen increase now. trend decreasing deaths steady Seems disingenuous keep attaching everything culture war too, are.  read article, you’ll see many families opted stay home school basically offering supervised online school. “hybrid” option looks like many districts across USA- teachers essentially teaching online, some/most students room them. Instead berating parents (rightfully!) seeing option great, make sure advocating local district fully staffing digital in-person option student populations get benefit devoted educator vs one spread thin.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Michigan likely getting hit hard
By UK variant, Ontario. live UK, also think third wave happen it’s believed economy mostly stay open vaccines continue rolled absolutely right, Illinois exact thing. 

I think CDC going say anytime within next couple years, governors going cave eventually risk losing reelection. No, saying able 100% full indoor events (bars, nightclubs, concerts, weddings, wrestling tournaments) everyone required mask time seated eating drinking. Want dance wedding later summer? need mask. believe if, least US, person would get handed 50 cash shot right site, lot people bothered get vaccinated would sign instantly. questions, apart question discrimination people able vaccine one reason another,” told U.N. news briefing.

Are talking able get vaccine due medical conditions? so, wow they're f\*cking idiots. like bunch working models already place vaccines required exceptions due medical conditions. get zero information J&amp;J. got antibody information Red Cross. It’s detected detected. choose to, know won't. They're hungry cash this. Yeah it’s helpful article details wise. I’m little surprised story isn’t blowing more. Isn’t Michigan hot spot right Texas? Didn’t Florida host Super Bowl February surge? ones list didn’t pass requirements? rough numbers EU might find Q2. Masks mandates count reopening. want go mask riddled dystopia forever. i've come across people wanting vaccine like good old days like influenza since tech around longer alive  According report, person COVID-19 China blew nose hand pressed button apartment building elevator. second resident building touched button flossed toothpick immediately after, thereby transferring virus button pass said like 12 times first week mandatory deal headache? much wrong statements don’t even know begin....and that’s coming someone “privileged health” also happens educated it/working public health. Unless satire, case, LOL. Stretch bitches out. take no. NYC teams leagues seem vaxxed negative test policy attendance, haven’t seen implementation MLB today friends attended game far season said requirement. think lot unknowns; vaccines new. you’re right, AstraZeneca study useful info, can’t really applied mRNA vaccines since distinct differences. hoping best guys! set appointment today! Got lucky get first dose next week. big relief fair enough. can’t wait life return form normalcy. Kids infectious AF people got vaccinated December need get another shot soon? slow-slow rollout EU pushes availability vaccines everybody ""not risk"" people even further? get better 2022/23? Depends articles numbers March not. March 1st 830,293 Michiganders fully vaccinated. numbers change little bit, still good. March number 1.569 million fully vaccinated. We’re getting them, rate US. even were, given hit hard variants, it’s clear would save us (see:  Michigan) say either. Weird. “Around 130,000 people Norway received AstraZeneca vaccine. such, six cases blood clots far reported gives incidence 1 case per 20,000 people Norway possible side effect.” Spring semester college usually ends like late April early May.

I don’t see point trying salvage rest school year they’re close summer. spoke friend mine works doctor NHS. He's looking data expects third wave peak August. take away amazing vaccine roll still long way go.   US, incredibly easy prepare forge right now. need blank CDC card. No, look excess death studies, good job identifying deaths.  I'll already second dose then, happy birthday me! Everyone eligible wonderful gift. Brazil Western Europe unfortunately UK. France like Mexico Misread quarantine vaccine whoops Well 03/01/2021 (article doesn’t say it’s March not) 830,293 Michiganders fully vaccinated. numbers change little bit, still good. March number 1.569 million fully vaccinated. So...you're going ban thing would put place decided put place....but never going anyway....ok..

Bro, electric grid falling apart, like, better things pass completely useless law like this? anyone know find study results reviewing nicotine potential treatment Covid? I've looked can't find them.

 
There five studies around world knew started last April May result preliminary findings France made suspect covid effective treatment Covid studies gone silent. I'm curious couple pharma companies using tobacco plants manufacture vaccines.  unfortunately, you’re right. can’t see wearing mask past july things go well. Ooh cool important immune compromised people! even sound good paper. overkill. Exactly one hesitates take vax doesn’t mean anti-vax conspiracy theorists. 

There shades gray. Yup this. People keep talking passports health/life insurance jack rates uninsured.

Especially long Covid symptoms turn last long time. Seen many people peddling “only lasts 6months” bullocks. literally says “still highly effective” six month mark. Maybe yearly booster, maybe bi yearly, take time. minimum 6mo protection something contagious amazing. Whole vaccine developed amazing. stuff practically fully open anyway (except venues) jurisdiction it. whole new meaning “what would Klondike bar?”

I jest, incentives vaccination aren’t ways bad thing. think studies yet confirmed vaccines stop transmissions. think studies confirmed, may need masks little bit. also think it’s there’s unified messaging behind going stores things. Idk think messaging change soon studies confirmed fear mongering caused. sub is/was huge part problem.  prefer steaks well done ketchup... oh wait. Leronlimab already around years proved safe treating HIV. trials showing reduces death desperate covid patients 80%, reduces hospital stay 6 days. No. isnt reasonable continue kind measures save lives handful kids politics. hate term, straight virtue signaling point. Illinois going keep mask mandate longer necessary order show country cares COVID conservative states. long stick hobby subs. lot broader general interest subs negative. Nothing EU solidarty. deal EU members would order vaccines separately manufacturers EU whole ordered vaccines from. EU whole ordered Sputnik vaccines. care EU solidarity, start paying attention what's going Malta. Malta country that's ignoring EU deal. bought Pfizer vaccines higher price EU whole has. People vaccines need even cautious spread without showing symptoms sick. Double masks required everyone vaccinated, per Fauci, perpetuity, Covid completely over.

Please pretending stupid First comment downvoted, second barely received support. ""Plenty"" clearly huge exaggeration. Brazil variant factory Weather much this.

There reason Texas low zero mandates, I'm guessing warmer spread means natural distance, outside.

Yes, California urban, we've great weather weeks. Risking exactly? aircon. schools it. thank you. also exactly stand topic. ""right"" attack private property owner make legal decision protect workers customers? Got it. Agree.  together China sole responsible global pandemic, unless solutions, better shut fuck see legal name ID details anywhere nearby. even know I'm located. browser use access account, anything. 
You even know half stuff write true. Maybe I'm big troll. 

I care real life privacy. Ah. Yeah. killer. need aircon friend. ...what? Probably. also wonder they’ll surprise everyone drop much earlier.

I suspect may happen. future vaccine requirements help that. example schools, business, colleges mandating people give reason people vaccinate Irrelevant, supply likely exceed demand weeks. 

Here Connecticut got first dose Moderna, refreshed vaccine tabs kicks found another dose tomorrow. starting get quite plentiful. bottom tier well. Vaccines 100% protection rate, it’s doubting validity, it’s realistic. Social distancing masking still important  know reason deadline given mask mandates lifted, uncertainty vaccines less fully implemented case counts drop. case counts get low enough (what constitutes low enough real question, would nice arbitrary number given), mandates go away, nobody government wants mask mandates.

Nobody giving solid deadline they'll lifted.... know get there. Actually no. Mario tell risk let 100,000. Kind meaningless data. Same, worked pandemic, still hate I'm public socializing. understand requirement look forward mandates lifted soon. mean, saw coming. see coming like eight months ago? Right? headline someone surprised turn events? Australia. see wearing mask going huge public place possibly rest life covid viruses. catch cold flu past year would get sick every year multiple times. don’t know legality idea know potential abused think final stimulus check go contingency people verify vaccinated. Helps solve selfish problem using money get people getting vaccinated rewards already have. feel boosters coming.  Well look Isreal UK. Deaths cases plummeted dumb sound.

\+1 
Imagine applying logic happiness.  
How dare happy, others around world happier you. luck getting vaccine? state went general availability last Friday, got blues weekend, found mass vaccination event 100 miles away got first shot. world’s full possibility wait.  people didn’t attend game spectators infect later on?  want Desantis President? media flailing half-truths sloppy reporting get President Desantis. Examples Texas Florida support theory. Hail Saint Anthony adults seem forgetting still best protect children. legitimately shocked Fauci finally acknowledging possibility masks around rest lives. first time he's suggested eventually safe stop wearing them? think I've ever heard say since initial reversal mask effectiveness. monoclonal antibody treatments currently available united states include Bamlanivimab (Eli Lilly), combo therapy Bamlanivimab/Etesevimab (Eli Lilly), therapeutic cocktail Casirivimab/Imdevimab (Regeneron). none AZ knowledge. Idk trump's vaccine brand public, maybe got regeneron monoclonals like did. IIRC 20% studied never got side effects. You’ve got good chance group point. always wonder logic behind that... like people generally question poor dietary choices poor life decisions, even though long term side effects much worse vaccine might cause. true. I’ve encouraging get vaccinated soon, board—they’re waiting others get chance vaccination. One looking getting first dose around beginning June, example. really need provide absolutely metric boatload studies showing Pfizer vaccine *highly* efficacious severe illness, symptomatic infection, asymptomatic infection, death, hospitalization variants? Oh, lot studies using real world data. 

I really hope don’t 

It’s clear you’re making anti vaccine argument. think we’re done travel, fully vaccinated now. safer home.

It still ignores fact basically zero risk coming home. media’s job report news facts, coddle hurt feelings public.  still go hospital take valuable space someone needs help something preventable? Nature healing gotta read article. dude blatantly said kids weren’t spreading OG covid 
 Unlike previous strains virus, see children 8th grade get infected often frequently ill, transmit rest community.""

So guy agrees “people” you’re referring to. Studies show two weeks first Pfizer shot immunity 80%. second shot bumps 90%+. got mine today, say it’s less trusting vaccine inconsistent messaging getting vaccinated, along demographic least risk catching covid.

When hear continue follow regulations getting vaccinated, get vaccination continue told nothing lives change?

The CDC/Biden **NEED** pushing “vaccines = normality” angle keep falling back masks. it’s mistake. Well shit Never said couldn’t take care them. taking issue teachers paid phone jobs. sub? 95% upvotes. bet also strong feelings certain people bake cakes. 

Unfortunately, 70% immune inconsistency position. 30% wants get way, don’t care gets there.   mean, we're probably going see even control people idiots he's right either way. Australia giving AZ eligible people, age restrictions yet! true blue leftist: you’re living reality looking data logic. stay inside forever want, we’re vaccinating like crazy you’re nuts think won’t enjoying summer. don’t know not. Sinovac Pfizer vaccine provide strong protection severe illness hospitalization, even Sinovac less effective

41% new ICU patients age group 90%+ vaccinated 1 month suggests ""very strong protection"" me. Well, good news, you’re definitely getting antibodies. stopped back June last year.... lol  Egads! I’m super positive optimistic type person (read: happy fool) agree you. makes sad can’t think others part processing. weren’t lockdown all. Chile lax regulations majority summer fall. vaccine rollout basically started cases surging. Texas half population South Korea. excited 40x numbers *after* comes down? IIRC different vaccines targeted different proteins within COVID virus, antibodies given vaccine different. 

Hence follows mutation variant alters protein one vaccine targets, may alter vaccine's efficacy mutation. think ""finally"" came New Jersey's silence opening up, irrespective actually opened it. They're second last state announce date, believe Oregon, everyone else made clear adults allowed schedule appointments.  complain me. number CDC. changed I'm curious know is. .75 would still manageable vaccines. never thing fuck people compromised immune systems guess. 100,000 dollars first dibs whole state? could get deal, weed would $5 g Florida. strong statement Tony Fauc. Fauci typically measured conservative prognostications, likelihood he’s saying occur earlier winter/late fall, pretty much strong endorsement you’re going get “yes, normalcy horizon” What's word 'now' title? Maybe 'now' we've finally realised? Lol. get used morons like chronic illness (I've ulcerative colitis 14 years). 32F also shitting myself! 6 days post Vax anxiety killing me! really gonna pretend even one ten Americans anyway? That's exponential growth works, obviously lost people thread. Totally fine. People know risks, feel safe need attend.  religions recently lol. theres reason slaves worshipped churches masters churches. also mormons didnt allow black people become mormon priests 1978, god told Probably. I'm same, 29 second dose due time. I'm going wait yes data, I'm starting feel like idea crazy, already protection one dose, think one dose AstraZeneca far single dose Janssen, say variants might render vaccines inefective, talking maybe even september / october might take different vaccine anyways.

So part says, ""well already that, can't undone, serious effect, already regrets, I'm suppoused protection right now... Maybe second time I'm going pass"".

Anyways everyone think make decission :) They’re idiots anyway. 🤷🏻‍♀️ awesome, good way get vaccine case local appointments continue full think time goes fewer people getting vaccinations made appointment. pharmacies willing give doses reserved risk unused, think eventually that's people getting it. really normal schedule flu vaccination high risk, think eventually commonly scheduled vaccination either. people really need honest say never want anyone able anything fun ever instead hiding behind hyperbole virtue signaling. mean, prefer bunch random twats conspiracy subreddit question measures put forth scientists actual educations.

That's doing. Bro. statistical sense point vaccination numbers reach levels make people feel secure people loosen personal protective measures 

So there's slight swell rising vaccination causes final plummet think good decision information available now. worry UK would go ahead without regard reported cases Europe. I'm 24f, first dose felt fine besides feeling sick next morning sore arm week. second dose 9th I'm getting scared. know chances small, I'm worried getting it. assuming ignorance have. would assume thought 50% fatality rate?

0.26% IFR ridiculous since would mean infection rate NY NJ 100%.

Nationally *per capita* death rate 0.17% estimated infection rate 30%. like IFR 0.5%. 0.75% B.1.1.7.  choice going vaccinating group vs vaccinating AZ. idea AZ replaced suitable candidate specific demographic. 

I’m risk analyst ethics expert, understand considerable reason investigating move forward. wish bag dicks large enough eat, especially given number fucks people like give time actually things worldwide pandemic effects human beings.

I remember god-damned well assholes talked summer. horrible numbers coming something actively brag about. GTFO. 😇☯️🤖 Similar. good thing know vaccine actual virus. actually virus deal long term, would scary love reference. Well guess what? Covid never going away. Ever. Even every single person world gets fully vaccinated. need learn live move lives. kids burden take care one year instead killing teachers.  think world enough children 3 worlds right now. one get? covid November. Got shots end February. 2nd one made sick hell like 4 hours. felt worse shot actual covid.  think worth noting that, understanding, dates adults allowed make appointments. qualifications necessary get vaccinated able walking CVS asking it. think that, right now, eligible groups suggestion, believe anyone besides Cuomo claimed there'd legal consequences administering vaccine someone they're supposed get it.

Also find pretty encouraging right around 170,000,000 Americans eligible, around 110,000,000 received least one dose. People ready willing get vaccines that's big relief. think combination vaccine infection induced immunities make perfectly safe summer truly normal. COVID 90+ days ago, would antibody test point show anything? (and would vaccinated already factor in?)

Having weird health issues I'm working doctors fixing them, I'm kinda curious maybe could caused asymptomatic infection (or symptoms mild notice time)... high risk activity partook recall back around October, I'm wondering even worth getting antibody test point satisfy curiosity.

Back late summer, early fall, hanging sister indoors, unmasked regular. nephew tested positive late October, got lot diligent getting vaccinated. buy average person 1/600 chances dying *a* car crash, single one... might maybe chance year?

What people drive mad speeds countries? experts questionable takes basically telling people one dose mNRA enough could kind let second go.

Which likely made official statement ""no, really need get doses"" call Canada's approach zero covid either. done, northern territories populations tiny remote? maritimes populations small borders also strict? Great. account 99% Canada's population. One word: Twitter.  

Two words: Bad choices.  
   
Three words: Lack parenting. least fucking balls say it. less dead weight carry covid way fail protect themselves. Like said though, boils political will, lack enforcement. absence laws. declare disease dangerous start implementing quarantines. former president spent half year running around pretending Covid exist, mention actively working CDC others. Good see churches supporting public health recs  Know know you’re uninformed? you’re concerned kids... reaction? Get 2nd dose AZ, fine. risks minuscule virtually none. Mixing vaccine type doses tested yet, may dangerous. let politicians act like they’re something. 

(And torpedoed bunch businesses, put lot people work, flushed several months year-plus kids’ educations toilet. restrictions quite bit, maybe much actually reduce disease.) never get vaccinations get one,

Well make feel better leaving loved ones care. Spreading flu fraile vulnerable people also terrible. Doesn’t article say 33% black Protestants aren’t going take vaccine? go.  someone cross post r/coronavirusuk? bad year past would useful.... that's actually true. think that’s fair. Maybe 2 months, yeah. Let’s wait everyone wants, gets. Yeah see home already modded pointing simple facts. I’m amazed hundreds hunts I’ve seen Reddit quickly disapproved somebody googling couple facts. People scare me, especially strong political ideology. course is. people qualify get it. there’s plenty displaced elderly people family means clinic facility, etc. EU: *visible confusion* quick change work morning small tradeoff number benefits get it. Saves around $100 month bus fare 2-3x faster bus deal bus crazies anymore. cost driving office parking city non starter (I math it'd probably upwards $350-400/mo). bike commute actually almost exactly time takes drive park car. biking kept great shape major positive impact stress levels work sleep better too.

Starting bike commute literally life changing. would never choose go back car public transit commute biking choice matter. Kind shit take. Public messaging important people let on. efficacy Pfizer 91%. means 9% still catching virus. Mind symptomatic cases definitely still spread it.

""Analysis 927 confirmed symptomatic cases COVID-19 demonstrates BNT162b2 highly effective 91.3% vaccine efficacy observed COVID-19, measured seven days six months second dose

Vaccine 100% effective preventing severe disease defined U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention 95.3% effective preventing severe disease defined U.S. Food Drug Administration"" feds sensible state governments invested billions ventilation systems reopening schools. american rescue plan biden signed last month earmarks $130 billion ventilation safety measures, california earmarked $2 billion similar upgrades top Damn letting body’s immune system it’s job.  way obvious mistake, guys infectious disease expert 50 years? Give break! thought unbelievably ridiculous heard medicine! mean really top would want somebody like handling you’re much complicated medical case? buried purpose, knew nobody would read except mask supporters. covering ass, jackass give fuck texans. article says new variant spreading kids original strain. studying original strain behaved schools, experts said safe reopen. article new strain different ball game needs reevaluated. ""could be"" mmmm! Welll... 50% chance? Hey 50% ain't nothin' shake stick at! said tested young people, tests old yet suffice; data,

then blood clots borderline statistically relevant, valuated data seemed random, continued got data.

It's like standing beach waves end: water - water - water - somebody asks clarity either completely sea completely shore. Agreed, probably will, especially given majority governors still heavy restrictions **refuse** say anything mask mandates go away. Whitmer Michigan 70% vaccinate remove restrictions. Utah legislature passed law kills statewide mandate, keeps place schools groups larger 50 (so stores) **and** ends restrictions soon following benchmarks reached: ""a two-week COVID-19 case rate less 191 per 100,000; less 15% intensive care unit beds occupied COVID-19 patients; state receives — administers — least 1.63 million vaccinations.""

The lack communication states makes believe they're going keep restrictions far longer needed. rant Hogan MD lot really, even kills statewide mandate, hysterics run county keep longer. German Norwegian numbers young females may like 1 100 000 demographic, keep mind that's still rare. well minorities. fine. aunt Canada got first dose today get second august. Many countries delaying second dose. I'm honestly shocked blasé people government industry even access population.  


""Big brother already watching, matter give even access..."" FYI SD Bike convention wasn’t super spreader event what? Government restrictions New Zealand? Canada? Ireland?

I get US anomaly claim government restrictions case curves aren’t related asinine given crazy amount evidence different countries. Polio paralyzed 1% people infected that’s still lot damn people millions people get it. Lots states opened 16 Also every person run polar opposite perspective it. make everyone take Biology 101, viruses pretty simple really. 80% immune infection, serious illness? Would mean there’s 80% chance didn’t get it? Stone age bad condition equipment buried solid walls. wish Ireland would this. Healthcare workers done first elderly chronically ill people done. meant essential workers (retail, cafes, taxi, public transport etc) followed staff education they've changed age based 35 year old working home get vaccine 28 year old preschool teacher working mask social distancing. course 🙄 simple people choosing get tested. everyone gets sick bothers get tested. different article?: best way get vaccine-reluctant community take shot reaching leaders public figures community, whichever race is. point said kids ‘shorter’ adults virus unlikely spread adult inhales good stuff unlikely spread gravity guess? surprising, distancing minimal use aerosols.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* common sense need show negative COVID-19 result travel, recreation leisure.....

***in order avoid MANDATORY QUARANTINE EXPENSE UPON ARRIVAL DESTINATION......?***

&amp;#x200B;

if do, need (as government required) present negative test.

like Hawaii.

&amp;#x200B;

(and special kind test, ***not PCR***, accepted certain outfits mainland, done within X hours state Hawai‘i ***ONLY accept Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT)*** certified Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) lab test results ***TRUSTED TESTING*** TRAVEL PARTNERS. negative COVID-19 test result required prior departure ***to avoid quarantine Hawai‘i.*** messaging media ""experts"" would variants become dominant, would see levels cases like South Africa UK saw. point  It’s pretty strange considering Fauci harbinger doom quite now. guess could say though Fauci saying “it’s gonna bad” Osterholm pretty much saying “it’s end world we’re gonna die” got super sick first dose, second coming (34 days apart). Hoping feel like absolute garbage long expect others same, fine tourist destinations require negative results within certain time period departure travel. Hawaii, think it’s 72 hours. get free test, guarantee turnaround time. plane tickets, hotel reservations vacation time dependent getting results right window need, might better spend extra $139 risk it. DC minimum would get vaccine card, digital records, able print vaccine certificate doses done, Health ministry.  expensive revamp them.

Nobody wants spend money. Personally, localized arm pain injection site shots. Bakery journalist reveals: whole cookie better half cookie life anyway, worst case scenario wait years. Well, go fuck themselves, already it. That's interesting. Ireland moves one unit terms Covid restrictions Monday coming, vaccinated people meet indoors masks. Unless willing drive Atlantic City, still really difficult get appointment locally NJ Seems like reasonable request, much like demanding partners get STD tested. reasonable dating required normal life. someone want disclose health information, that's fine. date you.

You can't say ability enter store. We're basically talking creating two-tiered society. You’ll fine.

At extremely small chance develop blood clot, government released guidelines frontline workers treat it. couldn’t travel, recreate participate leisure activities positive Covid test result, assumption you’re testing obtain negative result, keep testing do. agree could better worded. reached herd immunity

They saying point. Yep. I'd say 30% church congregation stance.

It's unfortunate. got Oxford vaccine. works. really works. guys Toronto Fan 590 shut day it, ridiculous it’s still clear 1918 effective.

References: western governments pandemic planning pre 2020 didn’t emphasize them. quote 2011 pandemic planning document UK. Although perception wearing facemasks public community household setting may beneficial, fact little evidence widespread benefit use setting. Facemasks must worn correctly, changed frequently, removed properly, disposed safely used combination good respiratory, hand, home hygiene behaviour order achieve intended benefit. Research also shows compliance recommended behaviours wearing facemasks prolonged periods reduces time.

Once read documents, initial response makes sense. think realize good vaccines really are. Children since probably vaccines people zero older want do? Make Mecca COVID epicenter Ramadan, countries slow rollouts?

Firstly Ramadan go Umrah, mandatory. poor, Hajj mandatory. afford go Hajj, poor, vaccines supposed affordable. Part requirements Hajj Umrah date vaccine record anyways, add COVID vaccine top that.

Gulf states free multiple options. developing countries, yeah rollout slow vaccine affordable. want fast choose buy privately, expensive yes, shortage demand either.

I saw headline Sputnik V went sale privately Pakistan massive queues sold instantly. price iirc 12k PKR would assume cheap. Covishield India supposed iirc 200-1k INR, people even paying 15k INR privately. also exiting long lockdown broad national school closures. question...its great see pubs gyms reopened opening mask mandates capacity limits? 

I'm Canadian watching countries get idea may look like months selling test promising negative result. know do. get second injection. immune system getting training fighting Coronavirus. There's way tell would turn out, actual Corona virus way worse? risk it. Easing lockdown huge mistake. hope decision reversed. going pub important saving lives beyond me. Yes. seems obvious me. 80% protection asymptomatic infection. like 90% symptomatic. study that's healthcare workers exposed much often general public. pretty much agree although think it’s month early? really. time vaccination, anyway. Um, *all* Millennials adults now? youngest people generation like, 24-25. idea deleted comment Super Bowl minimum 1/3 attendees fully vaccinated. National average may around I'm sure would line WWE audience since lot older people vaccinated first may people paying Wrestlemania ticket That's way feel. point elderly risk plenty time get vaccine. stage pandemic everyone needs assess risk act accordingly. I'm fully vaccinated I'm longer worried going baseball game infecting elderly folks grocery store. agree numbers fantastic show vaccinations working, forget also lockdown since early January.  bed ridden two full days number 2. can. maybe instead father, it’s friend hasn’t yet. 

Don’t get wrong - I’m going live fear. I’m vaccinated already comfortable going out. point everyone wants one get one, it’s still soon sorts massive events. think ramping up, go 100% right irresponsible. think government needs reach communities like skeptical vaccine. Set local vaccination clinics work local trusted leaders get message out. Every person vaccinated victory. How's 5g signal wouldn’t say either “responsible” way. Different countries tried different things got different results.

It looks like UK getting best results, results totally could gone different direction. Wow that's quite ways out, sounds like realistic timeframe booster shot us getting fully vaccinated now. Despite everything, one positive thing bullshit. daily commute completely drains mentally physically. thought drive back forth office every day gives anxiety nth degree. I'm looking work primarily remote (have work now) willing take significant cut pay avoid commute. can't anymore unless become completely desperate work. Delaying get level blanket immunity going faster doubling completely forgoing second dose problem! Tomorrow 5th day post shot. I’m anxious get 14 days get back world peace mind lol True, need chip away 25% refusing vaccine. you’re that, refresh&amp;cancel cheat?

Like, get wanting support newspaper paying, you’re going free route anyway not. test negative, wait till feel better get done. test positive, instruct stay away you’re longer contagious. circumstances book appointment tomorrow without getting tested first assume it’s COVID, run risk infecting people, especially it’s indoor space vaccines. data links? i’m maryland, also going mass vaccination site. imagine loose preservation, battle life, varieties possess advantage structure, constitution, instinct, called Natural Selection.

\- Charles Darwin husband got vaccinated, plan vaccinate daughter can, feel lot worried vaccinating ourselves. provaccine, never hesitated shot before, new. sure best her? Also, convince friends children vaccinating kids best well? I’ll repost comment earlier, you’re exactly kind person refers to:

These people really need honest say never want anyone able anything fun ever instead hiding behind hyperbole virtue signaling. Nobody cares. rightfully so. Idk sooner snowbirds get vaxxed up, sooner want travel US get done leave people age Canada win win. I’m Canadian, scheduled get Pfizer Moderna (will find arrive centre) - first dose week, second dose 4 months later. 

I’m super locked - haven’t store since March 2020, don’t see friends family, wfh, etc. Plan continue completely isolating 2nd dose (I immunosuppressed, qualify now). I’m concerned exposure doses.

My question - reason concerned 4 month delay terms post-second dose immunity? Every time read concerns relate efficacy doses, completing full regimen. NY Times article linked 3-15 actually states immunocompromised people need vaccines monoclonals... they’re using new Eli Lilly combo they’re studying AstraZeneca combo. Right, gotcha. Here's study came today - Basically, US vaccines ""stabilized spike"". ""stabilized spike"" creates robust immune response better handle variants versus vaccines stabilize spike. new data conclusions may change. Stay home wait. Recommended guidelines even say show vaccine feel sick. obvious that's kids school get vaccinated. Grandma's grandpa's dying cause kids. sad research actually done since knew beginning. Fauci actually one reasonable ones suggesting get back normal all. Osterholm ilk pushing permanent new normal. like Fauci's flip flopping goalpost moving least wants normality point. Oh, ok then. 10 days first dose now, that's bit relief hear! know, entire UK, Israel, Canada delaying second dose months—far “a experts”  I’d surprised Florida case. Might even bring back one old glory cases conservatives Lochner (which would ironic, given it’s Florida). live US family UK really want able visit fall (without quarantine 2 weeks). glad two countries shit together, I'm keeping hope UK open vaccinated Americans restrictions end summer. P.1 variant apparently concerned currently. Early data shows vaccines much less effective curbing severe illness. really, grandparents got vaccine Bangladesh last month! Hopefully able go year Saudi Arabia approved visa yet. 5 1/2 months, still sore 2nd day day 3 100% back normal ignorant comment. People walks life watch wrestling. yes, know it’s staged. That’s actually part fun. Sorry. dumbass know special olympics was. feel really dumb right now. Expedited, relative vaccines detriment. Feeling ill second dose supposed happen triggering immune response design. Healthy 30 means low risk variants spreading deadly younger people. known transmit vaccine definitely get vaccine. no, whole pandemic, would stop now? pretty much is. People shopping work still pretty much similar numbers terms who's wearing masks isn't. 
 
I'm getting sick borderline hostility toward mask issue though. wore face mask church think wore femboy skirt service folks reacted. lmao, think they're telling people that? Yep, I'm aware that. course open everything pretend completely gone we've started rolling vaccines. We're finish line people seem intent tripping it. - amazing feel normal again! Got first dose last week. second one 22nd April. Then... 2 weeks later... finally go see family. year. going celebrate birthdays holidays missed last year once. Pfizer vaccine 80% effective 14 days first dose. would guess starts becoming effective that. Sensible precaution. It’s ridiculously small, one smallest needles went hospital 5 days ago (not covid related) currently feel ""sick"" - however fever cough moment. 

In state I'm eligible get vaccine tomorrow. ASAP wait 2 weeks?

I googled found: ""If infected COVID-19 exposed someone is, isolate home 10 days recover visiting vaccine distribution site."" appears meningitis vaccine around since 70’s. That’s lot long term data safety. protection starts 10 days, increased lot 14 days Absolutely- chances work! We're hitting right Michigan. 35% vaccinated hospitals near capacity again, hitting younger ages harder, cases hospitalizations fast approaching worse level Oct/Nov like NFL teams people stadiums past season right? Yet spread traced back outdoor events.

“Happily exchange human lives profit” give break. extras don’t really care eligibility. mean, I'm still going wearing masks required, I'm going stuff year. Actually vaccines damn good preventing [transmission. dynamic, static. 45% rough!  it’s month since started Canada, apparently refuse leave go home. least VT, vulnerable vaccinated, makes sense cases would increase deaths. 

Also vaccines 60-95% effective depending type. They're nearly 100% effective hospitalization death, thats still good chunk population 'get it' hit case numbers, even mild. state country in? I’m Colorado general availability, went mass vaccination site, checked reservation date. OP I’m category. 

Several factors-
1. don’t trust expedited vaccine. It’s approved intend wait known vaccine. EVERYONE know vaccinated extremely ill days receiving second vaccine. 

2. still catch transmit virus without vaccine benefit really protect myself

3. healthy active 30 year old statistically decent shot mild case got it.

I’m sure I’ll get flamed “anti vax” I’m not. I’m surprised. Unfortunately university things nature, things like plannned months likewise based current events, unfortunately, could happen future. argument there. I've got grandparents Europe can't even get list vaccine yet. 4 people came contact past week caught it. Could coincidence, doesn’t seem like it.  actually possibility. US vaccines went ""stabilized spike"" others not. ""stabilized spike"" creates robust immune response allows handle variants better. seems like data came today there's much learn.

Importance stabilized spike - Eligibility registration whatever dont matter right? Cause might well give someone else rather expire keep good records causes death? dunno, maybe still transmit even vaccine? still gotten shortages bullshit requirements across country? 

When fuck hellsite become anti-social distancing? Jesus christ. don’t many old people. young median age, low adult life expectancy...if don’t many 75+ year olds, won’t many Covid deaths... already enough covid thank No, it’ll better time past 13 months agree. looked lot reasonable expected COVID-19: Let’s fucking go, Rangers! didn’t much except 2 days shot tired couldn’t even keep eyes open 0 reasoning chalked shot that. little tired mostly sore arm days every time felt soreness reminded it’s better alternative. Pfizer Moderna essentially tied efficacy Pfizer less side effects say Pfizer choice. Otherwise whichever gets arm soonest! die vaccine, chances equal better virus. 

That's chance works. That's like taking sample lottery winners concluding chances winning lottery 100%. I'm NY. eaten multiple times. Never saw sitting person mask. Lol, June states, July California New York. schools, places employment, air travel, even places mass gatherings like concerts, amusement parks, zoos, air shows etc could require show proof vaccination. would force vaccinations. yeah, cause one follow (Trump, one think they'd follow) kept saying hoax nothing cold. think guy realizes parents needed provide vaccine records attend school. I'm guessing turn fake news, yes. sources quoted saying MHRA might restrict vaccine's use like headline implies. growing arguments justify offering younger people - age 30 least - different vaccine

Giving young people choice different saying unsafe use restricting use. Also UK currently low vaccine stocks, majority people left vaccinated 50. AZ makes 50% doses given. restricting use significantly would massively slow rollout likely extend lockdown measures. I’d give gold could. Thanks speaking truth. **Apr. 6, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’ve even seen comments throughout Reddit people getting vaccinated still hesitant go stuff waiting, people vaccinated. 

If vaccine doesn’t improve situation, what’s point getting vaccinated? Can’t wait watch Dune packed theatres. That's wild idea kinda like it. curious would go mean I'd rather people get one shot none all, still... come people, we're close!  10 days? thought protection 14 days? Yes whole world needs vaccines stop continuous circulation billion opportunities mutate, sicken kill.

I'm glad groups continue research develop good *and* affordable vaccines. spread virus 101 realize one game leading one, don’t you? thing called “tournament.” heard sports thing... sister works Fauci NIH good boss brilliant scientist. 

This basically said..the virus new don’t know anything it...masks depend entirely route transmission still speculated unknown... virus isn’t transmitted air mask pointless still touch faces contact bodily fluids touch public surfaces. know sending Americans full panic mode something aren’t sure yet cause massive shortage means healthcare workers without any...

It’s considering every angle deciding what’s best vulnerable population time healthcare workers Sorry, may sharpest right now, can't seem find anything delaying second dose fact sheet... section on? 1/600 population doesn’t die car crash every year probably lifetime Yeah shit, else spread adults getting vaccinated? covid 1st shot wrecked 3 days. wondered maybe home year sick that's hit immune system hard, sleep mode. Haha! 33 here, thinking same. getting old! doctor. would think that’s fairly risky. see without trying rude, test less obviously less cases. testing numbers changed? redneck sporting event Tampa  This. We’re vaccinating millions adults day, schools crawling unvaccinated unhygienic kids back full swing. pendulum DIDNT swing toward kids primarily driving spread virus, that’d weird hell. soon daily new cases US fall 10k, think probably happen June July mask traveling gone. moths US. Europe might fall. sick COVID deniers Reddit. 

The day popular Fauci trending. clicked. suggested godawful subreddits everyone saying it’s hysteria big conspiracy left. 

If reading right now, one posters mock COVID think whole thing sham, know this: contributing inability return “normal.” 

That said, “news” isn’t really news. knew schools spreading it. There’s reason teachers fighting going back classroom denier-filled districts. 

Our country’s inability find compassion anyone besides corporations (they’re people, remember?) put us mess. way we’re getting people cut shit responsible. Texas Rangers near capacity crowd Well truthfully I'm hoping able touristy stuff maybe couple day trips well. Love family spending 10 days straight inside flat 24/7 would get bit grating end think :) Anyway I'm aiming October rush! pretty good job infection rates show African countries track excess deaths. Right? *worked* vaccine, freeloaders want piece? Sure, I've blowing steam shouting kids working retail stores, satiate me. shitload motherfucking buffalo diarrhea bullfuck!

/s too, course. correct point US. In-class even lunchroom transmission low area I’m schools open year. one place we’ve seen lots spread school activities especially indoor athletics.

Now can’t speak B117. However it’s transmissible,of course kids get it. get hesitancy, big difference zantac vaccine vaccine science driven zantac profit driven. Huh. TIL, Thank service! congratulations! Texas supposed upcoming powerhouse state and.. like past year keep shooting reason. Hopefully helps hesitancy evangelicals, rather doubt it. seems like whole “love thy neighbor” thing really dropped list priorities past years. sharing makes asshole. 

Doing vaccine equivalent buying toilet paper store opening time also makes asshole. well duh  think need look timeline lol. saying exaggerated, hoax, cold, control, taking vaccine secret, sandwiching ""if old take it"" november March (1 full year since) take it....I know message get through.

&amp;nbsp;

If someone saying, ""don't eat ice cream"" 200 times says ""Ice cream good"" followed 100 ""dont eat ice cream""...I know. seem like message get completely disingenuous. Listen get also infant prescribed Zantac reflux two weeks FDA recalled containing probable carcinogen. FDA approval. 
Scientists best aren’t perfect. 
I willing risk covid wait little longer confident vaccine. I’ll get it. yet. Well hopefully lead improved climate control, air quality, better wellness benefits future.

Need fewer schools kids stuck 90° heat inside widows cracked former child used go places learning confidently say disgusting germ infested kid every kid grade fact changed 2021 surprise theory: massive outbreaks inevitable, lockdowns delay them. massive outbreaks less restrictive states months ago, ones fine. big surprise here. Standing far away someone passing good catching whatever probably won’t land you. you’re stuck stuffy room person 8 hours straight inhale exhale air 3 thousand times, 6 feet ain’t gonna save whatever airborne shit they’ve got. Thanks...looking forward it, even it’s sucky! recognize Perfect Stranger reference? I'm old You’d wrong. I’ve inside months. give shit people. However also think overly fearful us aren’t older 50 disservice society. incredibly unlikely die covid age 60.

I don’t really care case counts hospitalizations deaths don’t go up. variant screeching unscientific. 

I’m also vaccinated, plays bit, like said, I’m vaccinated, people well. serious joking? Sorry I'm little unclear saying here. experience. first shot fever 102.4 2 days. Second one wasn’t nearly bad. Except Florida... Young people (&lt;40) look statistics decide need it. lol. far, couple variants like SA UK tolerable vaccine. Others like Brazil still determined. people don’t get sick vaccine all. 20% daily increase two weeks, that’s like previous curves.

I’d venture weren’t concerned either.

If Florida, land restrictions fourth wave, it’s quite possible state see same. gives pause.

Definitely come August, it’s awful idea ignore increase cases. U.K. first shots first wanted protect many vulnerable people death possible. close. Wear mask keep social distance vaccinated please. Ivermectin. lockdown shit idiotic begin with. Trump promoted vaccine encourages supporters get mentioned US still quite far away Israel right terms vaccinations, entirely possible cases still growing nationally weeks less restrictions public perception pandemic almost over. There’s probably large overlap faction enjoying free money talk people. sick covid recovered. get vaccine Race issues huge America. original sin slavery fact Jim Crow basically one generation past. fact big portion society fine cops shooting black people street cold blood.

The media blame this. worse variants now. That’s awesome. understand large majority us told go back work wear mask. Perhaps bad example teaching public

There’s many show tells kids risk, honestly whatever point. There's massive pent demand get cooped long vaccinated people willing get back normal lives.

Here Georgia, lot people about. Outside mask mandated areas, COVID going back people's minds, especially vaccinated. kids school year. 3 cases year. They’re strict monitoring state essentially issues.  new narrative/excuse going sub weeks numbers don’t go game? It’s nuts, it’s well-funded district anytime there’s referendum, flies (I bought house here, blocks school went to) throw money schools really solid tax base. high school beautiful, middle schools perfectly adequate, elementary schools “show proof kid learns better doesn’t swamp ass talk window AC.” kid starts kindergarten fall, I’m interested see things changed. Teachers working double time come lesson plans virtual students home students school. Definitely earning paltry insulting salaries. country whole isn’t really important localities involving pandemic. Also sorry I’m getting worked 20%. Increase cases that’s made young people. majority greater 65s vaccinated know kids vaccinated? Hi, teacher here, certainly phone job year. worked harder longer hours remote teaching ever person. assume sarcasm, isn't, point even surge Texas, simply enough time bad surge, since cases low reproduction number still 1 vaccinations soon available general population. Even lifting mask mandate. Interesting Uh, isn’t damn point? point he’s news everyday saying ol crap 50 - 60% start college. imagine many refuse vaccine weren’t going anyway. recently covid. Today ""day 10""...also birthday tomorrow. I'm blessed case mild mangable. even take sick day(worked home). question is...am safe birthday drinks (at home husband). lie, like get drunk birthday I'm also scared now. People getting used new technologies. like Industrial revolution, new medical procedures, changes society functions. People get used COVID vaccines. like got used flu vaccines. Good. College towns worst hot spots America right now. college students infect other. infect town. like 2 weeks flatten curb temporary government measures kids better get vaccinated cause schools opening fall matter what. COVID already? pharmacist administered shot said people strong reaction first dose likely COVID antibodies already. race baiting point white evangelicals significantly likely refuse get vaccinated non-white evangelicals, well non-christians general? shouldnt scientists, doctors, faith leaders try bridge gap way can? Narrator: Basic precautions taken. county CA (Santa Barbara) opened vaccinations everyone. going filled like crazy. got appointment Thursday J&amp;J. person wants risk getting sick, go ahead. choose risk, pay price. freedom options. don’t come crying sympathy decision made expect consequences. Canada working really hard get data think news channels running clickbait news got sick within three days spraying propolis saline nose constantly vaccine 20 month old. fact?

AZ oxford consortium working flat deserve way credit whats usually headlines. Large Oxford OXB thinking old one? place enclosed. Though roof open. county whole cases going up, including Florida 20% two weeks. Maybe want live? Don’t say that, got downvoted oblivion saying that. health responsibility. know risks, don’t take consequences outweigh benefits. That’s life always worked.

Also, know protect yourself, it. Wear mask, keep distance people, go essentials, etc.

Vaccines open seniors months now. mentioned father “old”. 55+? so, get vaccinated.

As Mom, vaccines open everyone 18+ Florida starting TODAY, go get shots. also intend provide additional testing boarding, top vaccine requirement:

*Universal testing &amp; Pre-Embarkation Protocols*

*All guests required take COVID-19 antigen test, administered paid cruise line, prior boarding receive negative result. Guests also responsible complying local health safety requirements may include additional testing.* third world country; difficult get access western vaccines, using cheaper less effective Chinese vaccine. Except sick vulnerable can’t get vaccine medical reasons. correct, going spamming refresh button walgreens page Wednesday morning. I'd say give one two months, we'll really see drop here. Yeah, bottom line gradual, 'soft' restrictions really effective changing reproduction number(R), especially later stages pandemic. guess look better politically compared hard lockdown, commonly used US. believe done response fitted reproduction number - cases rising steeply like Michigan right now, soft measures gonna cut reversing case trend. Statistics show people listen say “statistics show”. [Daily new cases 1/2 month ago. 1 10,000 what? understand basis assertion. 1 10,000 cases caused fomite transmission? mean? beginning imo. Faulty information gave people reason believe who/cdc gave fuel antimask beliefs. Even April last year saying masks make worse. ask potentially stupid question? astrazeneca vaccine uses differently technology vaccines, right? first dose astrazeneca last week, would second dose need astrazeneca too? there's talk longer giving 30s country, really know that's gonna leave people like me. also really want take longer recommended young people. another member minority: enjoy co-workers! They're good people try best, since work field lot things common. Taking 5 minutes BS something random co-worker refill coffee huge moodlifter. makes feel part something, opposed sitting home, alone.

I'm saying either right wrong, wanna bring perspective. Also, CDC effective entire pandemic health organization. Flip-floppin' place without common sense. I’m millennial too; getting 2nd dose 4/8! 😊👍🏼 know? also talk theoretical slippery slope well. even comes requiring proof vaccination COVID?

Proof yearly flu-shots know, save people way too?

Why bring back entry-ban certain countries people AIDS? save lives too.

Then know it, here's social credit score system like China (and say impossible happen here. shitton thought would never happen West actually happened last months). outbreak unless majority people faking vaccination would surprised many people don’t know use iPhones. work bank go detail reset pins online banking still can’t figure own. threads, think often handy remember skew Demographics Reddit may favour introverted, ""anti-establishment"" view WFH. 

It feels like people claiming middle managers want people office must never productive person meeting lives, never able form friendships colleagues, shame, honest. What? WTF?? things life concerts Explain one context additive risk touching surfaces makes sense me. Let's hope he's right. I'm hoping there's future companies offer flexibility. despise working home full time. hate gaming desk also work desk, cannot make mental separation work play negatively impacted productivity. Several colleagues mine also close friends love spending time with, able easily grab drink/meal/movie work. 

However, employees live bit town, bigger homes dedicated office space, forced back office would detrimental them. Fortunately company pursuing hybrid approach, senior engineers really pushing fully remote, can't empathise problems causes junior engineers. seniors suspect want accolade ""moved company fully remote"" CV tbh... J&amp;J can't say anything moderna. heard people covid worse response first dose moderna pfizer got j&amp;j offered. covid back January besides fatigued sore arm. I'm fine. symptoms. knows. ymmv. Percentages don’t stack like that. 41% patients well unvaccinated, vaccinated recently 10 days.

If lot fully vaccinated people showing ICU Chile, I’d think they’d saying right now. Nobody gonna turn sweet sweet tourism petrodollar Frankly no. say someone still takes surface transmission seriously often admonishes girlfriend so. 

If go store (as I’m confident living Michigan delivery apps aren’t popular San Francisco), you’ve already put exponentially higher risk COVID putting groceries away eating would do. It’s respiratory virus. easily spread eyes you’re wearing face shield. spread N95 mask you’re fitted correctly. you’re truly worried surfaces, wouldn’t set foot store guaran-god damn-tee you’ve touched someone something body that’s traces virus touched face point, even wash hands soon exit store. there’s whole aspect aerosols could easily sit air fall onto clothes eyes surface. 

If truly wanted 100% safe you’d actually order grocery deliveries, ensure delivery person stays 6 feet away door leave groceries outside house least 72 hours. Anything else is, know, porous. 

And that’s rub. protection, prophylactics, like Swiss cheese. holes. There’s guarantee. try needs enough. Frankly you’re EVERYTHING can, understand you’re trying that’s enough. I’m snow bird I’ve gone since September I’m sure afford return unless go dept. feel like Canadian allowed back... also good reason leave feel like people left rules put place exempt making super stressed feel completely let Canada. *if want prevent Covid 19 wash hands it’s good*

Either doesn’t understand virus video way back one understood yet airborne virus. don’t want call stupid many assumption made content someones chooses share support. Meanwhile parts world people really need vaccine. Honestly even need vaccine u 16? We’re good following orders. still produce logistic-cize (no shit it’s real word) like other. Everything authoritarianism. didn’t implement quarantine significantly better rest world year later.

But don’t worry, you’ll get vaccine summer 2022, maybe. Sorry clicked ""save"" soon edit showed reply. people thought full WFH going sun rainbows rude awakening. sure referring to, Berlin majority new cases kids aged 0-5, kids aged 6-14. Oh please. Smartphones pretty ubiquitous point app easier use Facebook. phone nothing--took 30 seconds set up. 

Of course logically feasible determine someone vaccinated. NY, people make appointments using name show photo ID personalized ticket enter vax venue. names info match, turned away door. I'm pretty sure states worked way. know one could get vaxxed without giving info giving fake info. sort found adorable whether vaccinated super secret private medical information you, blast public Reddit forums information mental dental health. used system like that. Even prisoners allowed exercise yard ok? workplace provided adequate ventilation space Well, handling COVID global embarrassment vaccinating maybe eight people day. guess theatre needed. right bear arms bring gun concert. businesses' choice associate vaccinated people? Probably mentions Yeadon. Outdoor hospitality opening week UK. 30 said friends happy drinks garden want go pub. want increase chances exposure all. They're making like that's mad, even though one effects long covid. sane? government passed law early reimbursed first day illness (in past stand cost first day off). Norway implemented similar arrangement. covered travellers without appropriate place self-quarantine, favor, extends non-necessary travel thus effect punishment without sentence option complain, proportional compared risks self-quarantine.

It likely violation constitution human rights must end. politicians need that. That’s actual people ministries.

My problem politicians talk, actually give people ground tools need job.

Vaccinations GP surgeries vaccinate everything delivered. It’s USA well. mean shit get vaccine CVS Walmart.

I worried even supply increases typical German fashion stick instructions letter, meaning wastage unnecessary delays.

If speak German go r/de see reports shit appointment systems are. keep collapsing tiny bit pressure. believe hold medium term.

There small amount people turned away mistake system.

Got example: mum given two appointments. Yeah, no. Businesses ones flexible guidelines survival depended it. International flights, maybe - depends seriousness spread given moment. even doubt it. Chin-Hong said “optimistic” vaccines would effective “double mutant” strain, given data showing vaccines effective similar strains first detected South Africa California. Well every year flu vaccines it’s hardly leap unknown. lol I’m kidding, good hear weather nice Everyone replying post hoc reasoning wrong actually right along funny realize he's scaring people got J&amp;J,

I think fault. Article clearly explained talking two doses Pfizer/Moderna better one dose Pfizer/Moderna. 

But title article really explain that, making ambiguous. know long term effects vaccine tpp believer science scientist vaccine doesnt make u immune doe   Really would helped CDC made focus day 1. obvious then.

Do that, could probably cut global death toll half, even more. Exponential growth means early success massive effects line. got shot. Fuck millennials. Looks like want chill 30s. called choice. February, it’s mid April. It’s 6 weeks. impact long since vanished. Ominous phrases ellipses science yet schools kids shuffle desks every 14 minutes, guidance within 6 feet anyone 15 minutes.

Thus ensuring instead kid covid infecting kids sitting next him, infects whole class. Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep hands stack Seasonality seems behave differently north vs tropics. Europe America one pattern. Brazil, India, Pakistan Bangladesh, Philippines different pattern close other. contracts complex really apply maner last case spur little spiked wheel back boots used kick horses urge forwards - verb ‘to spur’ taken means ‘urge forward’. Florida go. So, solid year primary guidenance focus efforts.

Seriously, damned obvious day one.

Huh, every coronavirus airborne, wonder one is? guess we'll pretend 6 months, spend another 6 months focusing aspect.

A couple really dumb public health decisions early probably responsible 80% death toll. Hooray, noone government implement way. 

Japan citizens wearing masks everywhere, even lot COVID, oddly enough manage keep infections low. germany need close parks, prohibit outdoor sports like Jogging must implement curfew reason, too. Maybe COVID gone summer close flower shops again...


It's disheartening high-impact/low-spread-reduction measures implemented randomly days notice severely fractured measures different city. What? feel better people forced living hermit life style? 

Yeah that’s real nice Let’s real. software engineer doesn’t need social safety nets, nearly all, all, healthcare paid employer. make 100% States Canada,

I make roughly 8x job pays back Italy, don’t healthcare costs since employer covers entirely, need safety nets.

There reason white collar workforce clamor come America. vaccine ... every college student know (including myself) desperately wants vaccine really huge improvement internal testing shown people sucking vaccine getting correct amount, even going 6 doses take account variables syrringe fluid loss. invention boost doses 7 removes variables. 

Best part invention 3-D printed uses standard smartphones produced locally goes world wide. thought saw last spring too. numbers south drop faster north? warmer weather higher humidity? Jnj different type requires one shot wonder Tamir, Breonna, Elijah, Ryan, Daniel would fall categories.

Feeling like invincible now.  😂😂😂 Credit credit due, poor middle income country punch far weight medical field. getting downvoted last month mentioning kids go back school spread adults don’t vaccine mighty fallen news bigger you’d think. methode used EU would mean 33 million extra doses, filling syringes carefully. fact millions potentially completely useful doses wasted suboptimal filling suboptimal syringes something find regretful. Question: understanding author Week Virology, Vincent Racaniello, seems saying variants transmissible virulent. First position? Second, seems like real world data support this? 

You look countries 100% covid strains classic. B.1.1.7 came slowly took dominant strain. could transmissible? 

I asking make sense want understand. help would appreciated. course it’s equally likely future mutations make COVID less deadly, more. No, burden proof Sinovac show real effectiveness field.

Pfizer done many studies US, UK, Israel. Sinovac studies Chile, Turkey, Indonesia, etc? make statements like provide proof - 'proof' mean tabloid newspaper articles.  seems religion (or anything matter) doesn’t allow participation people races ridiculously short-sighted arrogant. 

Granted, I’m random white chick, I’ll never understand mindset. Agree. Lock downs happened warranted. made sense lock part country initial surge didn’t get going September peaked early November.

I hope see news vaccine potent receive second dose 4 months later Good. Let reopening continue! 15 years flatten curve! Monday always highest numbers barring surprises (sometimes Tuesdays).

However important 7-day rolling average. ~ 2 million / day opened 60+. 3 million+ / day opened 45+.

With 24/7 working centres increasing sites hopeful rise 4-5 million/day sometime later month (again rolling average. may occassional/weekly spikes higher this)

However going higher mainly 2 reasons.

1. Vaccine hesitancy among people.

2. level supply going start constrain. Mrach end monthly supply 64 million/month works around 2Million+/day. working increasing 140 Million/month months behind schedule. 

So unless picks April end suspect govt burning buffer stock 80 million doses kept reserves ain't going last long high daily numbers.

Vaccines affect body immediately side effects. There's plausible mechanism action prior vaccines would lead us think could dormant side effect.

Lol stopped shit cause people died we’d nothing. Christian Scientists? 55? yeah fever expected, extremely variable heartrate shortness breath.. India vaccinated 5% population far. country generous exporting vaccines. I'm happy idiot tax continue, money idiots forced ""donate"" better /TheVoiceOfNoSympathyForSnowBirds They're huge people bring non stop even needed Good Duh doubt trying faithful description, /u/1003rp correct stats accurately describe efficacy means.

Say 100 people treated vaccine, another group 100 people vaccine A, third group 100 vaccine B. (I'm picking nice even numbers make math easy.) 

Simplifying studies go, let's say 100 people get vaccine, 10 tested positive within 6 month time frame. time frame, group got vaccine reported 2 cases. reporting efficacy, compare results groups... people getting vaccine 20% infections unvaccinated group had... means vaccine efficacy 80%. Similarly, vaccine B 1 person infected, vaccine B 90% efficacy.

There's difference vaccine preventing 80% people group getting positive -- would mean 20 people got disease. efficacy percentage applies improved rate unvaccinated group's infection rate. numbers match listed, would require 100% infection rate accurate. 

Your comparison 80% 90% saying twice good absolutely correct, trying get 'rooms' infection, would need first apply infection rate, -then- apply efficacy rate afterwards -- mean 80% people room going get disease; actually higher percentage would even get disease protection. feel like may least companies managers try make everyone come back office employees decide unionize preserve remote working.

So, I'm sorry experience bad one. Sadly, teachers able make transition well virtual teaching. virtual teacher virtual school, teachers well. 2nd grader learning virtually teacher phenomenal. dont think missing anything virtual instead person. 5 year old however... thats another story. teacher one make transition well.

As schools places could, many reasons. 

1. Schools little means enforcing things like this, unlike private businesses, violators kicked out. 

2. Schools resources available socially distance. give idea, measured school's classrooms went virtual. Normally classes ranging 20-26 kids. enforce 6 ft social distance, could fit 12 students class. means would needed 2 classrooms 2 teachers normal class size, students attended person (which ended doing). extra classrooms, schools usually don't. enrollment low normal year, districts start closing combining schools, schools use every classroom. basically always teacher shortages. 

3. Many schools adequate ventilation they're old hell. get enough money, never gets fixed. mean, worked schools still asbestos pieces ceiling held plywood 2x4s, think they're fixing ventilation, ocean front property Kansas sell lol.

4. Kids fricking nasty. disgusting germ factories capable understanding keeping away people. Also, lot places, masks required younger students.

5. deal whatever nonsense parents putting heads precautions. Masks social distancing required? Cause pointless lol 'Good ventilation' ... hvac code since 1987, building district money. 

I'm tired angry time. ALREADY safe them. Let's normalize reasonable risk assessments again. hate Texas Florida brought up! told exact opposite couple weeks ago. something teens suicidal thoughts etc, anyone got link that? cause probably bad study/survey. Moderna's recommended weeks 4 weeks.  replying something isn’t headline. Fail It’s especially transmissible everyone. children. ...because people die don’t? people getting ""sick"" second one.

No one knows would happen three. We're going studying boosters though. Rainey 6th back pre covid though. masks capacity rules bars. I’m torn feel this. one hand, would feel much better knowing everyone venue vaccinated. other, cousin suffers lot severe deadly allergies she’s allowed take currently available vaccines. hate thinking missing much something can’t control. get every two weeks surveillance testing. Guess government it. Better go get tinfoil hat.

In NM opt twice monthly surveillance testing essential employees, FYI. Positives gets reported state website location business quantity date, available general public look informed.  double that...“Barely even” putting nicely.

Reinfection happen definitely sufficiently rare far, even though data Brazil imply hat must much common Brazilian outrbreakt loving neighbor worked wouldnt crisis volunteer dashboard updates vaccine status State. nearly impossible get vaccine appointment several counties unless you’re willing drive hour more. Also, State lists eligible doesn’t mean you’re actually eligible. several categories get ignored vast number sites.

I’m sure plenty young people don’t want bother, think contingent older anti-vaxxers (you know, assholes who’ve bitching wearing masks whole time) going bigger problem. 

And according family members work healthcare, there’s still hesitancy among young women concerned vaccine impacting fertility (though I’m pretty sure COVID going affect lot more, know). Covid before, least highly doubt asymptomatic live two at-risk relatives I'm exactly best health myself.

This thread daily celebration vaccination number, they're high. they're not, everyone bummed. fuck get anti Vax lmao What's time frame getting online validated database? many weeks AZ doses spaced apart Germany. Netherlands it’s 12 weeks, means end April, incoming stock used 2nd doses. Better rest world? Total mortality stats, deaths per million popn, right near bottom pack, company countries anywhere near resources have. EMA confirms direct link AstraZeneca blood clots.

I think vaccine dead least young people, envy US never aproved first place. 

Is ethical giving young people riskier vaccine given others?

A young person wait 3 months example get safer vaccine, ""life death"" rush...

(I'm 29 got AstraZeneca regret it, get second dose...) Something really screwed link fault.

Click video get white page audio three seconds gone.

But message clear. over. lol brilliant. love downvotes without cogent rebuttal. Also, happens people can't get vaccine? going discriminate against?
I think terrible idea implemented. Would reasonable travel getting first dose? trip planned May year pretty strict quarantining, desperately need I'm trying safe everything. I'm still going wear mask, avoid crowds, ect, flying makes little apprehensive. hoping get shots looks like need wait four weeks Moderna instead two Moderna seems thing accessible area right unless hold hopes getting Johnson Johnson one, I'm little wary since newer. time anyone sets secure way businesses want nuisance COVID numbers customers care (and ones would cared vaccinated). health information huge liability leaked, meaning something software engineer create overnight.

Places care, next 1-2 months, check vaccine cards instruct employees take virtually proof vaccination. one going want lose business people forgetting/losing vaccine cards.

The enforcement 99% normal people anything fake records. Today’s day: get second Pfizer shot. 🥳 QR code name. Match photo ID. It'd complicated. AZ still like 20% expected doses Q2 negligible. Right lots takers can't expect continue. still administering BNT Moderna old despite recommending AZ young people. ""GIVE SHOT NOW"" crowd pleased could lead stocks AZ piling up. Maybe tattoo people Star David something know isn’t vaccinated? 

I find whole domestic vaccine passport absolute lunacy, say someone took social distancing seriously lined shot ASAP. argument that. still think EU approach export, especially lower income countries right one. Mutations Brazil example destroy whole vaccine rollout. must also make sure countries get least protection. Maybe banned export condition reciprocity. country production capabilities export themselves, wont get anything EU. Exactly, like actual science yea ok. i'll believe actions government rando reddit. fact is, trump dropped ball big time anywhere near far ahead still running show. greed, selfishness myopic nature nearly DESTROYED country. realize that, trump stan? REALIZE THAT??????? people want live perpetual state fear panic can’t imagine living world isn’t dystopian hell scape private industry governments dictate everything do. sure going police it.

Can't hold 5G phone next head see buzzes? Why? Expected deliveries AZ already take account huge cuts initial targets. think feasible 50% EU population fully vaccinated June. Spain, expectation 57.4%. Thanks, get habit looking though ministery pages often. experience seems bit exaggerated reported instances. 

I get everyone different, stories wild. nervous hearing people say 2-3 days second dose, sickest they've ever entire lives, etc. got nothing. First dose Pfizer sore arm next day. Second dose, woke next day feeling like hangover, gone afternoon. it. Lol..well that's they're iPhone users. census every while.

That give data estimate with.

Eventually. It’s sound clock makes. Ye EU naive think countries wouldn’t ban vaccine exports. Probably should’ve put place signed contracts.  think people left afraid mRNA vaccines also delusional antivaxxers take vaccine, matter form. Convenience ethics... bottleneck lack vaccines. Sweden capacity vaccinate 1.2 million doses week, we're getting 200 - 300k. Texas real state, imagined land invented Trump Fox News push anti-lockdown agenda, like Ohio. one many local state leaders ease restrictions, though holding precautions still crucial part fight virus, Dr. Ashish Jha, Dean Brown University School Public Health, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. new, ""simplified"" order, ready signing end Monday, includes wearing masks indoor locations, avoiding congregating groups larger 10 people maintaining social distancing.

Humans stupid, people vulnerable vaccinated, risk minimal, even rise cases. UK delaying second dose.  efficacy numbers 3 months doses point. nonsense? you’re saying asking information nonsense, get ready never travel internationally true data points get updated retrospect. case, usually data points reflect number cases reported day (which actually could cases identified days earlier). number get updated retrospect thus 7-day moving average perfect aggregator always show downtrend. doubt redditors going wrap heads around relatively open, less restrictive 'bad' state, pushing lockdown states like Michigan New York dirt? somebody apparently bright, (judging stated profession), complete misunderstanding “social safety net” healthcare employer provides astounding. 100% job security? Obviously no. major medical emergency develop chronic illness prevents working, happens? lose job bingo lose health coverage. 
Your attitude known personal normalcy bias. “Everything always fine ME, everything continue fine ME. ** ** don’t need insurance. don’t need won’t need make roughly 8x job pays back Italy, don’t healthcare costs since employer covers entirely, need safety nets.

Shit man- need get head ass. 1) still paying health care costs. far employer concerned payment insurance line item payroll labour costs directly you. far they’re concerned, personal cost “8x Italian salary” plus costs insure you. 2) wrote above, coverage lasts long you’re employed. assuming you’re good job won’t get fired performance, three factors easily result losing job- a) market shifts making position unnecessary. happens time tech shinier technologies replace obsolete ones. b) - ironically - get sick injured work. cases lose coverage fucked. happens time too. “it’ll never happen me” attitude dangerous. C) random natural disaster takes business, home preventing able work. become likely last increasing examples floods fires around world put many business. 

The “I don’t need property insurance nothing bad ever happened stuff” attitude bitten many people ass. 

sure, chances needing safety net aren’t high, think you’re still wayyyy risk assessment calculation. “I don’t need safety net” absolute statement, ignores real possibilities could absolutely happen you, unlikely much greater zero chance happening. absolutely covered “healthcare” company provides.

Good luck also young, even able 'walk talk' vaccine-safety, I'd get AZ heartbeat offered right now.  
Doctors aware potential risks could monitor needed.

Then again, propaganda numbers met. (The government wants start reopening country 2.5 million vaccinated people, first jab is, date 8th April.) mean every official source find puts rollout EU par even slighly US. difference US gets actual vaccines delivered get broken promises AZ. EU countries use doses get quite efficently. actually protect infection - least Pfizer Moderna shown studies smaller amount AZ. 100% 94% Pfizer, 63% sth like AZ. need 14 days second dose protection.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Absolutely. happen UK US country like compare us to. current delivery commitments received vaccine producers best guess therms 3 months. agree careful optimistic, especially J&amp;J currently produced EU, every day goes by, reason optimism. behind 70m Q1. Get this: promised 31 mil/120mil Q1. Even going far telling everyone doses found italy, 16 mil go EU, boosting doses delivered 47 mil first week april. yesterday 22 mil AZ doses delivered!!! end Q1 delivered 19/120 mil doses. behind 100 mil. Source: ECDC vaccine dashboard. EU definitely poor far vaccine rollout AstraZeneca absolutely diabolical. Hope EU absolutely rinses pandemic over. Would love know post Rule 4 violation. Well generally, effort underway past years divide us race religion by..media politicians probably one unfriendly countries.

However comes vaccine hesitancy, people may need categorized order effective messaging target them.

Looks like *evangecals* general little hesitancy.

It shame talked white church leaders doing. Ignoring black church leaders whose members also lot hesitancy.

But wonderful black churches members generally ignored unless fool  vandalizes church. Depends said that, March-May lockdown. Things gradually became less strict. observed National Capital Region January February 2021, wonder ""lockdown"" national government talking about. People like saying longest lockdown, aside initial 3-5 months, become less strict point list mask face shield wearing guidelines. That's good news then, maybe bogged social circle then. 
Could please give source claim BNT J&amp;J used primarly?  
I want able counter assumptions made ""Querdenkern"" around me. I’m same; hopefully flexibility everyone oh look, another idiotic German poster Tampa Bay Buccaneers, host Super Bowl, one teams permitted maximum number fans. spikes observed Hillsborough County, Florida, home games quite pronounced. Roughly 18 21 days nearly every home Bucs game fans attendance, spike cases. repeated pattern spikes COVID-19 case rates reflects time exposure illness developing, tested reported. similar pattern appeared across nearly every team allowed 5,000 fans stadium past NFL season. saw headline read “What learned every COVID tracking policy world” fact 90% used *today* elides two damning facts:

 - millions doses sat shelf weeks good reason
 - millions doses given second shots, double-protecting smaller number people illness rather protecting larger number people severe illness

Both contribute strongly current lockdown third wave.

The metric health officials optimizing ""fewest days possible vaccine shipment delivery putting unvaccinated person's arm"". That's saves lives allows people see friends live freely. Every day delay every second-dose shot given phase failure, Germany seems dead-set continuing commit failures. Exactly, 500000 per week Flanders, receiving half week. Oh nooooo!!!! Fauci Eric ding dong said it’s terrible mistake ??? Premature celebration EU way, least USA waited vaccines actually administered arms assumes screw ups like happened J&amp;J USA. Human error thing. quiet places long call open offices suck kind thing.

This. call people offices nightmare never enough meeting rooms. 

You call desk pissing colleagues mic picking random noise. also ends work area becoming incredibly noisy like working call centre really favourable productive deep work. Vaccinate every month! flu, flu symptoms. HIV, pumping air, blood invisible. covid, asymptomatic unless susceptible (which might like fifth population get bad symptoms.. btw, I'm getting number due theorized link Mast Cell Activation Syndrome covid, making stats nowhere..) 

We ban smoking public places.. see closer flu HIV.. even that, see smell cigarette smoke optional.. Covid optional easily undetected.. devastate someone quickly.. cheek planning exporting 3 million doses behind 70m doses Q1 expected half promised amount Q2.

Could entire adult population Croatia vaccinated those.  much better example United States.

actually pretty much same. 79% used US.

however agree rest posts absolutely insane people say USA amazing job next sentence blame EU countries vaccinating slowly. really expect 100% vaccines used second get registerted system? Depends implementation. places could require it, often would forged.

Need international travel, get job hospital? right, many people would bother forging paying forged copy. concert sports venues, malls event centers, retail office jobs required it, find forgeries everywhere. would take AZ take BNT Moderna. sure J&amp;J yet.

I young wait. fellow non-believer, please stop making us look bad condescending tone. far know, COVID vaccine that’s given two shots shots different Sputnik V, one Russian vaccines. last read, still hadn’t finished trials even though it’s already gotten EUA like six countries God dude really living bubble ignorance can’t believe we’re debate hyperbole serves lessen impact points, heighten them. That’s really great!

I’d remember nothing virus cant see 100%. seem convinced things like community spread contact tracing. like number deaths likely underreported 30% due deaths didnt know due covid. It’s simply possible 100% certain ANYTHING darn virus cant SEEN. I'm going restaurants enjoying get two vaccines.. Idk they'll enforce I'm enforcing myself.  soon rest AZ deliveries saved second doses anyway deliveries scaling like Moderna BioNTech. It’s non-issue really. Bro get vaccine. wrong people... Without knowing whether CVST link related medical condition, moot point.

You can't apply hand-wave virus vaccine. see sounds scary, right? “Take injection life know end”. clean got booger eaters here. logic locked forever. Get grip. everyone get vaccinated. Covid won’t eradicated. many ppl EU got AZ shots far..50m? 100m? many got blood clot issues...maybe 100 total

This like magic trick pulling bunny top hat instead it’s pulling random numbers ass. big assumption scanning app would able quickly reliably access EMR databases recording gets vaccine. cybersecurity nightmare. 

Heck, make vaccine appointment first place set 3 separate MyChart accounts 3 major healthcare systems area obviously Epic EMR systems talk other. Combine VAMS, CVS Walgreens, two supermarkets' pharmacy accounts, there's LOT systems involved.  

By time could sorted deployed securely, need long gone. office same. much happens informal conversations around office. I'm happy old-school ""butt seat = productivity"" VP understands remote work actual thing flexibility that, also know enough know work best office generally, team. Risk management left individual, government. Saturday fever, headache, chills, body aches almost whole day. got vaccine 5:00 PM Friday side effects subsided around 9:00 PM Saturday. 

I felt crappy nothing DayQuil Pedialyte (hydration helpful) couldn’t make tolerable. Good ventilation systems require employers spend money. Hand sanitizer requires employees spend money. give every 1 10,000 chance minutes time, you’d spend every second every day fortifying home getting inspected doctors. get vigilant possible every second makes Good Person ™, kind behaviour simply logical healthy. federal government wants them, private businesses countries travel. 

We definitely type vaccine ID system. lot businesses want them. Absolutely. 100%. use businesses. know delusion here. Everyone choose get get vaccine. Every business choose serve long discriminatory towards protected classes (people choose get vaccinated protected). every person choose businesses want use reason want. No, that's additive means, case. Perhaps check general dictionary definitions one assumed using. 

Better yet, Google ""additive rule probability"" stop harping this. haven’t seen doesn’t mean aren’t happening. means they’re typical hobbies don’t look them. They’re broadcasted news “football stadium full people cases still dropping” doesn’t attract viewers. Media needs people scared continue watch news make money. think businesses want pay maintain infrastructure vaccine passports? government.

I'm taking stance perfectly within small-government principles oppose vaccine passports. basically ever want able time. 

Even states minimal restrictions many take precautions own. see issues this. need ID say got vaccine get vaccine. Without knowing whether CVST link related medical condition, moot point.

You can't apply hand-wave virus vaccine. funny thing hospitals public schools can’t require instead people looking private businesses create incentive get shot agree Republicans hypocritical this.

I, socialist, perfectly fine banning corporations turning away gay people mandating vaccine passports. Pfizer, Moderna, JJ trials showed 100% prevention hospitalization death. report 11 fully vaccinated people hospitalized Covid, 3 dead. article reliable source? small numbers, significant true. would it.

Be fully vaccinated, get Covid test leave green traffic light country. That's feel makes sense make travel work.

Otherwise travel industry collapse. understand governments worried variants negative Covid test anyone fly's help. mean done airport. fast tests now. 

Hopefully sort universal digital covid passport system place (*not holding breath one. ever creates simple use working system first make huge amount money. Think VeriFLY trying good*). use Covid Passport proof fully vaccinated able book flight. 

When get airport checking take LFD test. comes back negative go boarding area.

Its little extra palaver able travel doable makes sense me. News: ""Hey vaccine could fucking kill you""

/r/cornavirus : ""*Benefits outweighs risk, wE'rE gONnA dIe aNyWAy*"" It’s opposite “you” problem. It’s called considerate. You’re right, probabilities according math class, it’s multiplicative expressed lack concern welfare others. find much offensive acronym representing profanity, Uh sub praises Israel's green pass time, somebody pushing it.  wonder wanted collaborate Sputnik lol! Come on!!! it? could significantly reduce deaths AIDS forcing people share info banning certain venues. It’s safety! remember people last year saying vaccine passports enter stadiums, venues, stores, etc. never going happen made conspiracy theory nuts, well. saying something like likely happen, goes show never really know future may hold. Medical information synonymous vaccination record.

A vaccination record medical information. anyone could argue otherwise beyond me. already share vaccination records go school jobs

Wow know this. Thanks new info /s. can't see difference schools restaurants, there's point even discussing you. thanks though, it'll make line shorter rest us.

It's least could shortening line hid cave last year. Wouldn’t get “vaccinated” reach herd immunity? simply true. states gotten rid exemptions public K-12 schools many universities, even public ones, religious exemptions. “encourage” mean “use brute force”, you’re right. would draw line? blood clot issue, risk serious disease 1-in-a-million range. 

Sars-cov-2 much dangerous even relatively young healthy people. disease causing long-term damage people ""mild cases"" could well incurable, potentially even degenerative. We've seeing indicators lung, heart, brain damage uncommon among *anyone* infected, seems appear they've tested negative active infection. top that, children particular developing MIS-C long they've apparently cleared infections.

I want accidentally cause entire generation school children suffer permanent, degenerative organ damage get life back normal. Alright, question. Today marks month (so four weeks) since got first shot Moderna. second shot scheduled happen seven days, five weeks shot one. timeline correct? Walmart scheduled got first shot, understand Moderna meant spaced four weeks...? okay wait contact pharmacy there? No... Perpetuate amongst people vaccine well, 100% effective, well people able get vaccine one reason another. Risk limited people make choice get available vaccine. literally do. want everyone scared are. healthy overweight/ health issues die covid vs healthy people take vaccine ?? bet numbers much closer interesting spin. 

We’ve got nation people, refuse respect minimal thing save lives, president who’s trying show wearing masks. 

And that’s massive failure you. 

The way could see failure wanted one wear masks mad he’s messing up. side effects? still infringes individual rights, though. “Inject cut supply”. force like that, there’s problem. 

And comes protecting staff, they’re vaccinated anyway, it’s irrelevant ""OMG wont think safety people? hope die!"" pretty ironic lol I’m glad say live somewhere self-centered jackasses like can’t cause resurgence measles epidemic schools name protecting “freedom”, like happened several counties thanks antivax morons. would like know compares blood clot risk birth control pills, 0.5% 1%. lovely person. He's advocating right trespass, demanding served private businesses. he's saying slippery slope demand papers participate normal life artificially creating divide society would harm good.

At end day, private businesses well within rights refuse service whomever choose, hand, private citizens deem risks forego vaccination acceptable viewed ""heretics"" ""outcasts"" declining vaccination. comparing way people born people making choice. gay disabled something anyone control. Choosing get vaccine reason besides diagnosed medical conditions completely prerogative individual. 
I discriminate patriots fans want. discriminate people like color orange want. choices make protected classes. AIDS spreads significantly despite airborne people (outside reddit) sex yawning chasm ""there reason optimistic"" ""we need worry, reopen everything, live fear, MAH FREEDOM"" nonsense.

The rate vaccinating way justifies lessening restrictions process complete, that's way prevent deaths. Anyone saying otherwise basically using variation ""screw you, got mine"".

Go away. Update: EU drug agency denies already finding causal link AstraZeneca vaccine blood clots. 

Ignore URL - across board absolute shambles - AZ, politicians healthcare officials. Need get get PR people board pronto - important making go along. state could pulled funding places. That's excuse. act signed law 2005.  agree whole ""us vs them"" getting hand. wars got started, hope people realise unusual 75 years mostly peace Europe.

That said, still think risk small, certainly worth considering affected groups. specifically chose Moderna even though places offering pfizer near me. Simply offered much better protection easier store handle. Plus really liked mRNA technology reading fairly thoroughly. 

That's factual negative findings AZ bound make people cautious safer options. blame one bit either. likelihood safe, changes nothing present. switch Moderna/pfizer? work so? ""So vaccine working well groups, doesn’t seem bad all.""

Exactly - headline like get local ""non-profit, non-partisan"" news source clicks, it? get you’re kidding, lot people thread unironically thinking way. “It’s 30 seconds disinfect groceries. take 1 10,000 chance?” people ever leave homes? people issues risk assessment. guess there’s also lot virtue signalling there. I'm definitely noticing people big cities wearing masks outside, think we're 4-6 weeks vaccine widely available, people stop wearing regardless mandate. Credit scores scam &lt; Even fully vaccinated prevent one contracting spreading disease 

That data experts indicated thus far. state, nobody 55 eligible get appointment yet. Nobody 65 yet eligible unless comorbidities.

This change immediate Nobody 16 eligible approvals.

Very people 16 serious risk major problems herd immunity 80-90%

Citation needed. [There’s still lots reasons wash COVID kills around 1 3000 people aged 20-40 catch it. 

Can get source that? Switzerland, 205,301 people 20-39 contracted COVID, 12 died.^(1) That's 1 17,100, almost 6 times greater statistic. remember, absolute maximum death rate, many thousands cases never confirmed 20-39 age group. data EU, surprised numbers many countries similar. 1 3,000 1 17,000 huge difference, really make difference assessing risk.

I've never heard employer, except maybe Google, this. Seriously, bunch Redditors claim care people, sure seem hateful bunch. religious exemptions One great thing measures adding pandemic also help prevent spread respiratory, viral diseases. Better ventilation means fewer kids get flu. 246 positives 1,800,000 fully vaccinated vs. ~240,000 positives 8,200,000 fully vaccinated since start year. Irish gov said adults least one shot June. Well calculation completely ignores deaths 20-40 years age group hugely correlated medical conditions. I'm 30 year old male medical conditions increase risk die Covid-19 sure would take vaccine immediately. I'm healthy 30 year old female would definitely second thoughts it. isn’t literally gamblers fallacy. We’re talking game strict odds, we’re talking unpredictable human behaviors. Flip coin 100 times row it’s heads every time, odds it’s heads next time? 50% course. infected covid? every person infected (and quarantined recovered) vaccinated, probability infected goes down. I’m someone leery AZ vaccine, I’m cautious, social distancing, wearing mask, etc., I’d wait extra week. that’s me. public health perspective, know that’s wrong advice. personal standpoint though? make decision. People want normal back, even shit parts it.

Anyone wanted lasting changes going disappointed. Lazy people going take run it. Jesus, first starts leaking Super Top Secret Government Labs. start shooting brains 5G towers. they're MINING it?? Children??

What's next? Tracking devices vaccines? Good. don’t need passports then. I’m struggling understand benefit this. vaccines ridiculously effective (against virus variants) vaccinated people really need fearful unvaccinated people. are, think personally choose deal perceived threat struggling (indefinitely wear mask, socially distance, etc.).

If vaccine passports supposed encourage people hesitant get vaccinated, think backfire. People choosing get vaccinated concerns, likely trust sort system (medicine, government, etc.). Making mandates probably isn’t going build trust, instead deepen divide. 

This also isn’t going keep virus spreading among unvaccinated people. there’s anything we’ve learned, people able stay locked down. Working-class people vaccinated continue work in-person (as throughout entire pandemic). Unvaccinated people socio-economic classes continue see family friends fulfill social needs. continue live lives, regardless whether allowed go concert sporting event. 

It seems like absolutely public health benefit perception safety people already protected. potential downsides elderly, poor, disenfranchised communities vaccine-hesitancy prevalent (disproportionately people color) would need jump bunch bureaucratic hoops even enter local library reason enough give us pause. 

I think focusing compassionate education people reluctant get vaccines, educate vaccinated effective vaccines are, perhaps even public health campaign help people psychologically cope fact impossible lead risk-free life. far Norway. According Steinar Madsen, medical director Norwegian Medicines Agency around 1 20.000 Norway. might read articles solar radiation inactivation. get frozen refrigerated food get sunny days (even winter) put direct sunlight 10 min side plus 70% quick rinse hot water (thawing refreezing also breaks viruses plus removes residual alcohol) putting freezer fridge. way handle prepping food consider clean don’t take special precautions.

We 30+ min sun dry goods alcohol usually leave days degrees F using them.

I’m high risk well. get everything delivered. sense risking little bit extra work. Literally Covid 100% preventative job doesn’t take home.  virus always spread children, variant.

I know Osterholm good job feel he’s hysterical long take seriously. We’re going cases see happens vaccine effort. might misunderstanding, think implying might reporting delays holiday, easter cause spike actual cases deaths mean reporting, Easter actually cause lot deaths Easter day fewest reported deaths months, likely least part holidays mess reporting. 

The superbowl Mardi Gras impact reporting. Australian here. think also politics. Old mate Scummo copping heat making huge promises schedule vaccine roll falling incredibly short. Heat’s turned last days IMO mighty convenient timing. He’s incredibly poor leader year, there’s number sexual misconduct cases within ministry cocked responses - people don’t time political spin lies this, it’s lives livelihoods line. people break rules, falsify test vaccination proof.

Canada tried lenient ways first... two hours. say? Vaccines allocated federal government. ""they""? guy made financial calculation better earning 8x theUS Italy try tell made wrong choice? 8x salary save healthcare becomes unemployed. Imagine 70k year Italy 560k United States- crazy numbers enable entirely different view risk vs reward. 

The healthcare exchanges work fine ( Cobra short term). afford healthcare. one hand, fucking accept risk smaller risk hospitalised corona.
On hand, maybe tell shit company stuff now. see. vaccinating people 50 now. 60's pretty much done.

Frontline workers high risk people would young got Pfizer vaccine first one got delivered.

I mean could right really done roll AstraZeneca 40's yet. blame though? Police big business 100% get tracking data system, know American police isn’t exactly perfect 😬. GDPR either! Ah yes saying it’s incorrect without backing anything. works. made point. It’s vaccine v variant race US since January. countries level vaccination it’s fair comparison.

Maybe seasonality something maybe not. rhetoric tried failed Mardi Gras Superbowl. highly doubt it. US business ""best friend"". Well Danish one state health app required nearly everything apart go supermarket. Businesses also going fined enforcing it.

I think comes difference culture. Anglophones hate government data them, whereas much normal Nordics far tell mostly accepted. suppose UK's delayed second dose strategy mean soon need inject lot second doses, hence slowing pace vaccinate new people.

Note approve competitive tone sentence, though. hope rest ""vaccination marathon"" goes smoothly possible everyone. It’s true holidays ALWAYS affect 7 day averages. I've seen people rubbing hands alcohol every five minutes underground masks nose. seasonal allergy sufferers here? changed use due COVID? typically use nasal corticosteroids(nasacort) + antihistamine eye drops. remember last year bit hesitant recommend anything tampers immune response. I’ve got Pfizer shots, I’d like immune system(especially mucosal immunity) tip-top shape, I’m living much freely year. adorable think stops vaccine passports, that's foot door fun stuff. shit. could get hands one 🙄 find miss restaurants much. suspect we'll entertaining home family friends vaccinated. submit QR code door I'll scan it.... \*grin\* I've stopped reading British news outlets. Used read BBC every day, dont even app anymore become simple pamphlet British tory government. Learn past diseases FFS. vacuum. Applying previous knowledge basic skill science. best way handle people wanting get rid WFH, make sure office sized, can't ever really bring everyone back in, unless want spend lot money.

WFH, save lot money office space, company sizes offices. Company work for, sized offices long covid moved towards ""hybrid"" model, resulted people working home regardless supposed ""hybrid"" approach. Wow yes, imagine. 💜 view ethics differently.. see ethically responsibility make sure virus mitigated point taking enough lives one biggest killers threat mutations greatly lessened.. convenient, important.. 

I mean, see reason concern.. happened airports 9/11 pretty bad.. remember start though.. Oculus closet I'm thinking getting rid closet going require facebook account future find company intrusive.. covid completely different level, see conspiracy theories, really align reality.. stupid comment Charles Michel. said EU schedule vaccinate relatively faster UK Q2, making shortfall. Absolutely incorrect. US loaning doses immediate neighbors Canada Mexico (especially latter). Australia good situation COVID-wise wait little longer. Many classrooms growing didn’t even windows really disagree analysis people are... social also selfish. Yeah don’t actually think danish solution bad - specifically analogue; it’s business owners checking negative test vaccine. 

Where gets scary suggestions digitalization it; smartphone apps QR codes enter building. suggestions straight China. What’s point sharing totally irrelevant production issue article? Again, clue you’re talking about? aren’t. building manufacturing first roll relies imports. Look time. What's point? numbers world rise. still wash hands avoid number diseases. dirty. shouldn’t worry 300-400 thousand family members getting AZ vaccine. Lots bots subreddit. There’s pushback shows social media. don’t get people say they’re really turn around post pic vaccine card Instagram. people really cared medical information secure, would that. Nope. can't yell ""fire"" crowded theater. 

Good luck finding crowded theater test limitation First Amendment. see actually works. got first shot handed little card name it. real ID way would easy forge. Unless centralized database vaccinations using unique identifier like SSN see this. joke? There’s chance. basically framework soft version Chinese social credit score, astonishing much power people willing hand people charge like didnt get done seeing lunatic charge 4 years. Ok, let revise statement. likelihood got \~40,000 people get vaccine exactly 19-23 day window precisely 0%. 

My point less anyone freaking they're getting dose exactly 21 days little worry about. long 19 days later than, well, probably weeks months later, it'll fine.

The vaccine magically stop protecting get booster day 24. didn’t mean flu season all. Look current map infections. Thousands died last month cereal breakfast. Exactly 9m become 21m. people wait week appointment, go restaurants, young kids go them. pretty simple. think prevent everyone vaccinated able life others reluctant unable. one linked article thread points to? AZ shit bed spectacularly, EU would fine vaccination progress without blocking exports.

AZ supposed deliver 120M doses Q1. delivered 30M. total amount EU received manufacturers Q1 107M doses, means would've gotten nearly double number doses AZ delivered promises way likes Pfizer have.

In retrospect, EU probably gone ""EU first"" approach similar UK US done. top US infectious disease expert warned fourth wave Covid-19 sweeping country UK coronavirus variant could infect children easily previous strains. Michael Osterholm, director Centre Infectious Disease Research Policy University Minnesota, said US beginning “new surge” infections B.1.1.7 variant “brand new ball game.” Former Food Drug Administration head Dr Scott Gottlieb also said fresh outbreaks disease could children, spike cases Michigan, Minnesota Massachusetts. hope seriously stupid enough expect stand comedy joke legitimate engineering idea... bite words huh. There's definitive connection Astra blood clots now. talking Ohio voted Obama twice? sure details. People nursing homes got virus, sent hospitals treatment, sent home. cases, ""home"" meant nursing home. else could sent them? Hospitals filling up. I’m quoting article. thought surprising pattern. Luckily made “solidarity doses” - fully support. guess also reaching saturation remaining doses divided countries done time less. ask questions allergies, read carefully answer accurately, mention person giving shot allergies, they'll probably keep closer eye shot. fuck, someone something Thanks tip! Yes, concept vaccine passports sweeps Trump2, they’ll outlawed anyway. 

Vaccine passports thing America. think it’s time people think it’s worth pretend be. either stop talking continue talking suffer backlash. Might bounce back little given Easter next days 75% 65+ year olds vaccinated 3 million shots day happening 5-8 weeks away deaths falling low levels EU big thing, yes. Could drag pharmaceutical though dirt loose money though shares would make selling vaccine bloc. Also yes. link?

The reports saw said around 100 cases blood clots 17 million vaccinations 0.0006% means vaccine still 99.999% safe. knows 100 people condition put higher risk. would worry it. true EU countries. Slovakia, example, main focus Astra making orders, result ordered 55% available P/B doses. think people huge wall comes asked vaccination status every day life, travel work school.

It feels inherently different people get asked vaccinations customs bar street. feels far controlling government reaching life way before. feels like privacy creep, that's legitimate concern.

Yeah slippery slope argument, like precedent it. government creeping decades like this. Patriot act. TSA searches. Snowden/NSA. Etc... one additional way monitor control behavior. That's going sit nice American culture.

Individually, big deal. Check ID, check vaccine passport. Fine. However, someone creative find ways use discriminate.

If nothing else, could divide country. could towns establishments split middle bars conservatives hang one checks passport vs. liberal bar they're strict vaccines.

What always comes is... legitimate benefit requiring vaccine work/school/travel like we've always done. already things place. information stored securely. leads high compliance. legitimate upside vaccine passports? East Texas good maskless. Lubbock hear. see next surge. lol test see Yes, it’s german way things. Bloody facebook whatsapp U.K. likely finish vaccination marathon crawling fours..

Am missing something here? would anyone think this? Hope springs eternal! actually request is: find underfunded overcrowded urban school district well functioning ventilation. think so. Remind 3 months Man 4 weeks vaccine, evidence related.

That headline. anything said killed? 

BTW, back 1K DAY DYING. hope stand comedian wasn’t seriously stupid... say nowhere near herd immunity? Estimates 40% population exposed 25-30% least one vaccination. Depending degree overlap getting close 70% threshold often cited. dad Norway actually. 65-70 group quite line previous optimistic estimates. Work office relies businesses enforcing it. we're competely woods, bother. vax set employer got vaxxed clinic time. level proof. However, clinic simply asked verify name (possibly address second one). ID checks. kind bothered it. could've sent anyone place. ID check standard, not. Yes, overrunning health system. vaccinated they're hazard you. positive test, negative test(s) apparently healthy, positive test later typically counts reinfection reinfection statistics.

That's correct. reason could residual first infection rather new infection. lot times give governments/people control something it’s difficult let go power. Success ass OK, maybe, there's big difference NFL regular season now. Vaccines. Adidas 32 degrees (Costco/ amazon) thin light. anyone know counts logic fallacy name is?

I'm tempted call ""conflating"", might it.

But yeah, another example layered rules there's even slightest bit potential confusion, people default convenient comfortable interpretation. worries, MSNBC told us case numbers rise, even though 7 day case number averages 65k 61k (6%). ain't giving ghost yet! well asked stay vaccine center 30 minutes shot instead usual 10-15. really, forge cards risk, see problem. think may mean seasonality different way. Changes dynamic people’s gatherings. likely outside inside windows open. Higher humidity means less aerosol droplets. Closer sun means virus inactivated faster. sort thing. Seems lower transmission right people start going back inside it’s hot. year distance learning isn’t going cause much damage. Depends many actual get it. 60% do, enough spread occurring variants ongoing concern. get 75-80% vaccinated, probably snuffs enough.

The key getting half “vaccine hesitant” least hesitant go it. hard part. guess don’t (and never have) understood wearing mask big deal. I’m planning go away vacation summer wear masks indoors lot things outside. weather nice prefer eating outdoors anyway. past year involved lot sacrifices (but also brought amazing gift time kids) don’t really see wearing masks avoiding big crowds limiter things want life. Honestly, full year one house getting sick, think use masks flu season high traffic areas forever. flu pretty miserable wearing mask colder months actually bad all. Well see, hopefully they're uptick get venue going ""we accept online codes"" god, I’m one getting pseudo-symptoms due anxiety... many vaccines think UK producing? much think exporting? Same. I’ve always little baby shots. seem hurt arm longer anyone else, though. flu Jab leaves sore week. I’ve learned roll it’s still better getting flu. safe travel vaccine appointment bike? would biking 12 miles home shot. bet days publish something says causal link everybody say EMA seems change mind every days.

I rather think likely announce found causal link yet (aka: happens) pretty certain link exists (aka: know happens).

Which course allow newspaper pick whether want run ""No link proven"" ""certain link"" headline. medium-rare steak mentality

I’m Seeing Minnesotas report today. seeing rise 3 states either stable rising everywhere else. We’re right track - point.

And person you’re potentially spreading 90-95% protected well, chances spread drops virtually zero. Yes many jurisdictions report numbers weekends, even less holidays. Sorry. uptick week deaths retrospectively administratively counted. Even true (and really since non-vaxed people going year), hit point 2-3 months number vaccinated otherwise immune people drop infection rate nearly zero. 

And point small number people can't vaccinated endangering anyone. Yes. question becomes majority people actually want. polling data that? Sure, course. said another post I’d probably show card go, people comfortable this? people damaged every activity must make feel totally safe? mean adults vaccinated pretty unlikely scenario.

Actually, states longer report COVID numbers weekends state holidays (Good Friday).  happens Wednesday, reason celebrate. People said thing super bowl every holiday, guess label every event super spreader event eventually might right! past year cases plateaued.

See doesn’t work...

And even plateaued, haven’t, half China’s total pandemic cases every day US, abysmal figures. I'm probably simplifying it, difference between:

1. 1 truck delivering 100,000 items location location B
2. 1000 trucks delivering 100 items location locations 1 100

Unless item available nearby brick mortar store, everyone ordering items delivered homes absolutely, dramatically, increases amount fuel involved getting items people, therefore increases carbon footprint. everything used do, wear mask, I'm fine wearing mask. I've gotten pretty used wearing mask even I'm running outside huge deal me. doubt happen, would nice like Japan wear masks sick protect people. bad last year been, even caught cold kids sick even though I've working full time they've daycare/school entire time. anecdotal, life seems masks stop germs spreading I'm talking covid. everyone access vaccine moment. Several people know unable get it. Let’s apply logic conservative ideas listen screams socialism corporate communism. 70 mile one-way commute.

You took job 140 mile commute day? That's crazy begin with. Tragic Totally fine Hopefully announces plan allocate doses based shots given time. There's plenty logistics pipelines: waste keep shipping vaccines places getting deliveries faster give out.

Wow discovered politics nature hypocritical. Amazing discovery. grocery stores allowed open! Planes allowed fly! Stores you’re allowed enter! still can’t go concert many states 14 months thing (due gov restrictions anything). that’s people thinking creatively plan place open back fully. Note isn’t happening Texas Florida, states still can’t go concerts. don’t really supply constraints anymore we’ve already partially vaccinated 75% fully vaccinated 55% seniors it’s time. still spray groceries stopped putting packages quarantine 4 days. pour packages wash hands. Sometimes wipe packages mail long. vaccine 100% effective. Say got ineffective dose. Normally that’s big deal rely herd immunity anyway without realizing it. 

 choosing get stabbed puts risk, along others whatever reason actually can’t stabbed. Sure, maybe Maryland. got first shot NYC checked driver's license (which state, show another city ID card confirm resident) confirmed DOB like three different times. right. optics, literally wear piece cloth nose mouth fine. suggest someone's mask urban outfitters hardly anything get labeled anti masker. Sure n95 masks work unless government going mandate provide people what's point? Wonder strain based on. People ignoring happen again. think people realize asking vaccine demand medical information however - vaccine we're trying give everyone can, exactly revealing much. 

Like told suffer spontaneous pneumothoraxes lung surgery attached lung ribcage via sort chemical scaring caused scar tissue adhere. Hey that's like super personal.

If told also vaccine... like.... people developed nations soon enough. 

Medical information private ""private"" like lets say needed wear adult diapers 20's that's honestly something may want everyone knowing. 

But covid vaccine? Eh.... anyone honestly said one business? feel like even people antivax openly saying whether got it. people I've seen said something like ""whether got vaccine personal I'm willing reveal info"". take don’t get invited parties much Updated title: *EU drug agency denies already finding causal link AstraZeneca vaccine blood clots*

Please note EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee expected issue updated recommendation currently ongoing April meeting taking place April 6th-9th. know cause lead singer wrestler lol Sounds kinky 🤤😉 Sunday? Around 4,250 deaths fully vaccinated. *citation required

“Experts saying”... precisely? Seems really weasel wordy... actually didn’t think pessimistic statement, don’t think he’s really flip flopped much. pointing someone ever really made overtly optimistic prognostications, make clearly optimistic prediction it’s big deal

Like, I’d much rather listen Fauci Osterholm. think Fauci quite consistent measured. Name one time last 50 years government turned stove without people demanding it? assuming deaths stay same. could well end equal sweden faring better end. Incomplete data still.  Rest water, doubt vitamin would hurt! Sorry buddy. I'm looking forward vaccinated go things again, one cell body wants return office. ""anxiety"" really feel like giving four-plus unpaid hours day working office takes me. work takes much time, five days every seven, there's simply time left anything else all. 

I may agree hybrid arrangement allows work home majority time (with, say, two three five hour periods office week) that. stinks, can't go different CVS own? Showing proof vaccination worldwide pandemic order go concert next 6-8 months giving REAL private medical information ok. 

If read article you’d know also show negative covid test. don’t get everyone arms “taking away freedoms”. building fully open otherwise least 6 months. don’t want people know got vaccine wait 6 months, simple. Vaccinations open everyone 30 states, essential workers list large number states, high risk ones vaccinated. Furthermore, 50 percent population vaccinated covid, reducing R0 significantly. 

At point think it’s reasonable people go normal lives? May. vaccinating 60 year-olds take May anyway, agree mostly non-issue. may see AZ unused Germany starting end May, time either data give younger people conditions countries take it. personally want someone spit mouth get fully vaccinated leadership weak time would take tips chinese. immune system actively live mouth nose lungs long take immune response kill virus going to, matter minutes, hours, days? 

If vaccine, immediately. That's difference vaccinated vaccinated. time, virus spread? 

You usually need certain amount viral load order spread disease. probability thing. live virus shedding likely someone else catch it. I'm confused amount people able successfully fake minimal. like amount people able fake actual tickets events minimal. imagine would want avoid high-risk activities vaccinated?

Ohh yeah, right.
Right high risk activities I'm going supermarket drugstore. theater, movies, restaurants concerts next year.
I understand point, again, understand spirit, idea rule. understand need it. think harsh intrusive unfair.
I read proposal, think vaccine use mask? vaccine nothing?
If government going implement rule make available free charge 100% inhabitants. 
Also, think measure going alienate antivaxers? problem rare reaction shows days week vaccination, easy miss cases reporting. doctors aware it, pay attention. 

This severe reaction though would EXTREMELY hard miss looking it. like standard blood clot could go undiagnosed. get CVST know it. Lol misleading? EMA official told paper clear link. says data provided soon. calling liar? way that’s misleading he’s lying. 500k chance dying vaccinated. I’ll take odds.

I previously covid horribly month, thought vaccine would hit harder.

If takes get past covid another hurt arm day blah bring never want state fear covid gave past year. Obviously. point inconsistent. OK require vaccines one disease another disease?

The answer OK. *There reason* this. politicized. Governor Abbott motivated politics instead motivated protecting lives Texans like be. also repeal current law mandating public school kids show proof repealing need ID things like voting? consistent. Correct constituencies want pandemic continue - certain tech companies investors profit ""remote"" activities chief among them. strawman lol. heard global pandemic we're talking one virus. year hopefully one care ask sort vaccination pandemic over. permanent thing.

You're completely right, asking random things like aids. But.... We're not. making scenario.

I think okay put extra rules around global pandemics literally changed entire world maybe know, anything else. people believe Noah lived 600 years old every living thing descendant animals Arc. zero critical thinking skills. seen anyone really talk more, surprising. Like, going happen school district require covid vaccine, someone throws stink, school board points vaccine requirements, probably happens vaccine requirements removed.

Less office time wasting drama whatever else. Less traffic people go in. contract EU AZ publicly available. clearly states opposite claim. AZ agreed priority orders EU order.  guess, dinosaur took literally thought meant guests also attendance limited numbers rather band playing mostly themselves.  coming back say I’m done!! Whoop whoop! thankful. Stop pusting bullshit Even US doesn’t need booster, there’s whole lot people/countries world haven’t vaccinated makes sense test updated vaccine tailored variant circulation now. True. Well, live vaccine isn’t available everyone yet, many people don’t choice all. there’s that. states limited supply, people make tough choices. could get vaccine state available appointments three hour drive tomorrow, ten minute drive next week? Many opt latter. like seeing someone wore helmet get motorcycle wreck causes brain damage claiming helmet nothing. absolutely moronic. vaccinated mean cannot spread it. vaccinated mean cannot contract it. vaccinated extremely effective preventing negative outcomes (hospitalization, death).

95% nowhere near now, 19% two shots 30% one. yet time loosen restrictions. write comment people. strawman me. Yes. 

""Galit Alter, professor medicine at Harvard Medical School and the Ragon Institute MGH, MIT, Harvard, said fast-spreading U.K. variant seems able evade vaccine protection, South African variant appears able skirt even more. Despite that, said, none completely escaped body’s post-vaccination immune think able see many tests actually Texas comparison many say 3-4 months ago would quite telling. trying find verifiable chart testing amounts trouble finding anything recent verifiable. Wonder stopped releasing data, almost like Hiding something. see, belief everyone choose vaccinate protect themself, matter others get vaccinated.

What people can't get vaccinated? father law pretty severe auto-immune disease unable vaccinated. doctor explicitly said allowed get vaccines anymore, still speaking determine get COVID vaccine. also younger family member (elementary school age) unable get several vaccines medical reasons. children unable vaccinated due health issues, would feel sure immigrants hop boarder anyway without us knowing they're vaccinated not.  that's moot point, many illegal immigrants coming without us knowing anyway vaccinated great nothing worry about, that's choice can't mad it

Please change topic. Illegal immigration issue, millions legal immigrants coming US work every year. people show proof vaccination? can't read scientific papers, even could, know parse them, could, know see methods used reliable etc. Why? I'm expert. So, someone recognized expert/authority says data says X, assume true. 

So, theory, Fauci says something assume true, unless requires immediate action part, continue life assumption. 

Your life going lot harder learn rely experts field. got time offered vaccine still.

Wait report data actually released. consult doctor sort situation. 

Whatever take important medical advice Reddit please even person offers says legit! Right. Point being, like said, keep numbers relatively stable, OK.

And add another resource, breakdown age: [More under-30s also think it’s good option prefer office don’t feel like it’s fair require people better working home come back office (especially hit herd immunity) that’s manager’s personal preference. main reason get vaccinated AZ right – 70+ – B/P available within 3 4 weeks would prefer vaccinated B/P AZ. Especially considering full immunization AZ takes 6 weeks longer B/P.

I personally would take AZ today, since wait months I'm eligible B/P. Alex, I'll take Female smokers hormones birth control 2K.... really want know stop spread, read NFL it. resources interest this, shut teachers staff vaccinated. 1 month needed, look michigan. Lets go Fauci's numbers. 60-70% herd immunity. 70 kids 100 vaccines hit herd immunity means 30 kids vaccine. decide get vaccinated that's parents choice - reference herd numbers still legal say fuck WHO? Asking friend.  lot really condemn colleagues practices they‘re far it. Well otherwise could hire someone Kansas save money.

*Fuck yeah*, I'm my... third Verizon clamshell phone I’m side argument except evidence falls. something investigated, proclamations like without clear evidence reckless. oterh 5% whatever protected lack spread 95% spreading it. 80s upper midwest great weather weeks. ""locked inside house"" narrative false. confirm, told everyone arm hurt. you. whole world you. logical analogy mean, sure way thinking def comforting.  
I probably going contact research facility come June ask opinion do, realistically severely doubt point AstraZeneca escape review process unscathed far 1 death every 1,166 people 65 years old 89% time, person died one underlying medical conditions. really hard consequences?
Also gen-z millennials, mortality rate even lower...
Also, vaccinated, would fear unvaccinated person? harmless you, vaccinated? Nahh still don’t understand. pointed it’s misleading pinned mods did. said wait data meaning proofs there’s causes. never said would read data choose believe Honestly would wait see happens. AZ may still get EUA US, also alternative vaccines used countries may accepted they're required work school international travel common again. Nine deaths 1.5 million doses 1:150k tho. sure get 33 deaths from. hell problem lmao Let make easier then. need ID vaccine. 

Simple enough ya?   much likely die covid time refusing AZ vaccine receiving alternative die vaccine-induced blood clot.

OK, correct I'm wrong, I've seen people say AZ killed younger people (~30 years old) Covid Norway. Meaning young healthy, chances die Covid less risking possible blood clot AZ. could outsource jobs would already. think businesses want cut costs? know like person call centers exist shuttered outsource jobs? actually need people wfh try that. Yeah testing more. comment advocating getting rid restrictions something? I’m sure you’re continuing argue me? already thanked correcting me, agreed you. Again, can’t wait see daily average climb 3-4m day 100+ million, soon remaining 200m Americans need shot read post realize don’t need wait anymore, sign get right away!

It’s going something truly magical see! expert this? stay home was, best way avoid virus that's transmitted magic; keeping distance washing hands less secure can't reliably keep distance, masks help.

But we™ eager go cuddle everybody streets feel safe hanging mask chins. Precisely already home. searching magical ""collaboration ""? There's **no excuse** techincal illiteracy more, especially need work computers. 2021, bad 'real' illiteracy, especially even understand basics. numbers times guide people, step-by-step, open *settings* genuinely staggering. one entertaining thought permanently requiring vaccine things. larger capacity events, essentially way safely open back - Meaning venues, sports arenas, etc start making profit year more. alternative events still safe without vaccination. Yeah, husband smart phone absolutely refuses get one. He's Luddite; hauls around Surface without complaint. he's cheapskate, old Verizon clamshell costs $5 month. he's gonna get added second line smart phone.... cheapest, bottom barrel feature phone get away with. Proof yearly flu-shots know, save people way too?

Doesn't really sound worse proof COVID shot. Everyone get flu shot anyway. bring back entry-ban certain countries people AIDS? save lives too.

This kind silly comparison. AIDS airborne like COVID is. Restrictions large crowded spaces, like requiring proof vaccination negative test, make sense COVID prime spreading location. bet people killed traffic accidents way get vaccinated.

This argument intellectually dishonest baffling anyone type without aneurism. Yeah .. look eligible getting vaxx NJ, almost everyone. godsake, workers eligible one. friends lied said they're smokers asthma. screening anywhere. 16+ requirement cause blip demand. NJ needs megasites, Metflife's big. Personally I’m perfectly happy national health agency doesn’t blindly follow recommendations EU agencies. we’ve learnt anything last year, it’s none agencies come perfect answers every time. It’s evolving situation, data isn’t quite yet, it’s always going judgement call proceed. 

To call people anti-vaxx responding legitimate concern kind ridiculous. viral vectors turn source problem, _really_ bad news Janssen Sputnik-V vaccines use Ad26 (as opposed ChAdOx1 AZ). vaccine card literally name, DOB, dates received dose it. There's sensitive info driver's license probably think twice presenting want beer. Working IT, I've heard stuff life. job 1 step away outsourced. happen sometimes? Sure, companies get hypnotized lower costs. reality usually means something urgent comes (which happens lot), employees reaching side world ask someone speak english well bad phone internet connection help. 

Communication difficult, documentation code lacking, availability tenuous. job keep costs I'm one people relied solve problems. hired anyone outside US now. think it’s extremely unethical take vaccine you’re able to. think right shielded consequences stupid selfish decision made yourself?

If private venues want serve people vaccinated (to protect workers), government step force allow dumb ass in? order attend need figure vaccination recorded, whether that's state-managed database site administered it, hope they've partnered third-party application verify received it. 

Maybe worth capacity limits still enforced can't see really cutting people attending restrictions. submission linking marketwatch.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* True, added edits. that's separate issue whether risk ""adds up"". Read article. 62 year old man history hypertension heart attack. I'm doctor, I'd say pretty clear-cut cause death. dude breaking world record long jump logical leap 61 years, experience. idea it’s working, calmed concerns. Good news EU pass UK Yeah NY Excelsior pass coming think it’s inevitable get it? Unvaccinated people.

If vaccinated, matter get it, almost zero chance severe infection you. I’d say end May cause week two Israel hit 50 percent really Show doll gubment touched you. 2nd dose Moderna yesterday--today feeling fairly lethargic body aches/standard sore arm. Totally worth It’s pretty survivable. friend mine got he’s still around, long term symptoms. However kicked ass days couldn’t smell taste right like three weeks after. 

I’ll take safe vaccine didn’t give side effects that. Fauci debunking Osterholm others’ 4th wave hurricane talk Morning Joe today. Ya love see it. first dose would risky one, fine second I'm getting vaccinated, vaccine severe side effects. I'm simply gonna risk it. I'd much rather catch disease self-isolate get another vaccine then. mean either vaccinations required start concerts again, can't concerts yet. Either way, she'll missing time being. headline actually be: ""62 year old man history hypertension dies heart attack... BTW, vaccinated month ago"" sure would even work I’ve vaccine month ticket Gaga’s concert Chicago supposed last summer. God hole doesn’t cancel, time hope held safely then..... Shocked taken long get it. healthcare workers know got Pfizer jab Months ago. also need wait two Months get seconded dose.

As classed high risk (*guessing due clot issues years ago*) could got first jab ages ago thought people needed put awhile. got first jab AZ 19th March coming shortages reported around time. Still happy wait 3 Months get second jab glade get it. I'm vaccinated also want share medical information get restaurant. public health experts told leave n95s healthcare workers convinced wouldn’t help you. public health experts pretend like vaccinations don’t work mask mandates don’t fall apart. haven’t figured government lies keep gullible dumdums check (hey that’s you!) you’re already hopeless. don’t worry. You’re already “following science™️”. Critical thinking optional you. Monitoring help patients got blood clots.  
  died. last 5 years tickets emailed accessed app. paper needed. 
Next time fly take look number paper boarding passes. Sure app based. See. happens nations, like UK, stop exporting vaccines, like INDIA US. 

Luckily EU still exported vaccines. Otherwise UK wouldn’t even able give citizens second dose! worry lot people sympathy marginalized groups suffering vaccine hesitation, groups met scorn mockery.

Which get, feels counterproductive. Fortunately live Europe. wife vaccinated. 65+ population becomes vaccinated day. what’s problem?? ""The J&amp;J vaccine confers immunity upon lot faster Moderna Pfizer vaccine. Really two weeks, start protection one shot, we’ve seen clinical trials. Whereas Pfizer takes four weeks Moderna takes six weeks.""

That alone makes suspicious Dr. Kohli's credentials here. takes 4 6 weeks mRNA vaccines reach full efficacy. absolutely take 4 6 weeks ""start protection"". one thing caution people take risks they've completed vaccine schedule, another misrepresent efficacy time curves.

Ok, let's look Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccine. small study, saw robust CD8+ cell responses:

""We report vaccination BNT162b2 induces coordinated immune response SARS-CoV-2 S-specific neutralising antibodies, CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, immune-modulatory cytokines IFNγ.

All participants vaccinated BNT162b2 mounted de novo S-specific CD4+ cell responses almost 92% participants mounted CD8+ cell responses, detected ex vivo ELISpot assay. magnitude cell responses varied inter-individually showed clear dose dependency. Even lowest dose 1 µg BNT162b2, vaccinated participants demonstrated robust expansion CD4+ CD8+ cells. Dr. Kohli says mRNA vaccines ""don't generate quite good cell responses"" exactly said why? really valid critique mRNA vaccine t-cell response, feel-good statement make people think getting something special Johnson Johnson vaccine? vaccines use Adenovirus (beside Coronavirus vaccines)? There's Ebola vaccine, probably widely used. Ultimately AZ reason UK 2K infections France 80K.

We recording 1000+ deaths months ago now? last figure saw 10.

The younger demographic probably wait alternatives, also grateful AZ vaccine roll achieved.  Trust me. people Michigan get vaccine put slightest effort it. Here’s take. 

J&amp;J : younger less healthy people who’s terribly worried dying covid also don’t want inconvenience side effect

Moderna/Pfizer: older health issues, want protect death also reduce symptoms/contagious (however unlikely is)

AstraZeneca: people like go casinos (I kid kid) could been. Biden quite clear wouldn’t mandate vaccine passports said local communities could. 

Isn’t next step? local communities legally able mandate them, wouldn’t proper response ban them? 

This legislating works.... Except point still medical information. even read comment replied to? It’s great YouTube channel people call “analog horror.” videos set context podunk local TV channel seems lot issues airing weird things. 

This one’s favorite idiots? enforce weapons venue? search. Sure sneak something in, I’m sure do. It’s honor system anyway society feel like need cheat system whatever reason go it. live yourself. that. guys sinks classrooms? deduced viruses family everybody told so. Pretty sure contraceptives increase risk common variety DVT, weirder much dangerous cerebral clotting syndrome that's observed vaccine. Yea times 30K people you’ll line wrapped around city Ha exactly! complaining work home weekends holidays.. that's choice even we're office, thing. want seen management working hard staying late office. move STL least 'burbs spend 10 hrs week car? bartender already check ID expected cross reference names?

lol. state 2 dosages necessary. literally treatment recommended manufacturer. 
Obviously wold case. 

Even though variants less affected current round vaccines. P1 variant comes mind, example. mean medical information?

Stay actual point. Norway deaths &lt;40 age group compared 4 5 vaccine 200.000(?) vaccinated. benefits outweighing risks much dependent specific country. Covid rampant lot daily deaths, yeah, probably push vaccine before. 

However, situation different Denmark Norway. Denmark we’re seeing 1-2 deaths day. It’s hard argument make, young, healthy people take risk blood clots, risk death COVID basically zero them. People medical issues always exempt. know this! Immunocompromised kids still attend public school without vaccines kids get vaccinated cannot spread it. problem arise little miss anti vaxx chooses get vaccine becomes vector spread immunocompromised. want vaccinated vaccinated, there's reason even this. want vaccine accepted risk.

Repeating isn’t going make true. area doesn’t enough vaccine uptake control virus, aren’t going done pandemic. Depends country role :) risks either case, getting vaccinated still winner, protects *others* too. GRINDS GEARS: 

This attempt reciting famous Dumb Dumber line, is:
""So TELLING there's chance."" 

That's that's all. think know anyone friend group family extended family vaccinated.... state screwed something?  Show called leftist us anywhere near socialist/communist ideas marxism. Kinda like Texas dropped restrictions 3 weeks ago relatively low amount people vaccinated. Cases spiking!!!

...........................................oh wait, lot crap clearly brexit national pride. people 16+ REALLY want vaccine absolutely get appointment one right US. sure trying prove. Look aren't, they've already said so. I’ve high income top notch health package, 23 years husband worked there. they’re union feel smidge safe job security. I’m passing raises health benefits. actually received $7000 annual stipend taking insurance employer since coverage already.
So I’m fine.
I’m aware it’s case everyone insurance shouldn’t tied employment. Feasible? way? go school job would prevent this? technically it’s feasible. Yea, it’s kind big problem vaccine killing young, healthy adults low chance dying disease vaccine supposed protecting from. Chances are, you’ll feel side effect second. data yet though. using ""Hicksville"" surely get people side. I'll say again: depends age group. No, better taking AZ young. People rarely die due COVID younger age groups, would risk braindamage potential death could get infected relatively fine instead? Never wildest dreams media think brainwashing extent possible. Aren’t embarrassed? Govt fucked them. don’t blame distrusting. They’re right to.

Then please accurate representing comments. It’s fair.  Tact. Serious likely stupid question: hand washing overhyped it’s hard get infected surfaces? Like I’ll still continue washing hands obsessively ends curious Almost occurances happend second dose

This wrong. Germany given 3M 1st AZ doses, around 2K 2nd dose. practically data blood clots 2nd dose. MHRA tell get vaccine I'll get it, won't. know that's difficult concept some.  fault, parents' fault brainwashing children. Well, always mrna future madness. chances getting blood clots way higher standard contraceptive pills plenty common drugs, 

And side effects written take pills lieu masks good ventilation, social distancing got. 

Good luck getting kids keep masks properly. 
Good luck finding school US good ventilation. Let's see, trust health experts warning risks consequences... listen guy reddit.

Gonna go health experts one. Sorry, friend! Everyone pushing information, whatever info seemed useful. released general population, mean granted date asylum hearing per US law? here. card CDC, there's QR code it. dates got vaccine (handwritten) Maybe code thing recent change? think problem young people died. 0.6-0.7% based UK's estimates. Granted population. OP still wrong though, far flu (&lt;0.1%) regardless. Disclaimer: I'm pastor someone expertise, average redditor Christian. claim know everything either religion, I've done reading differences I'll answer best can. I'm wrong feel welcome correct foundational beliefs Jesus divinity role savior non-optional why?

Those two foundational beliefs Jesus shared honestly enough explain Mormonism Christianity. literal central tenet. built base beliefs fundamentally same.

But examples foundational beliefs Mormons share utmost importance include that: people need accept Jesus Jesus Messiah order saved, Bible Word God, inerrant, extra supplemental texts necessary understand God, Mary gave birth Jesus virgin.

Mormons believe reach salvation, also need accept Joseph Smith focus good works, Book Mormon essential along Bible, God Father literal father Jesus, sort implying literally came Earth physically impregnate Mary.

Not mention Mormon beliefs specifically regarding Jesus like rejecting Trinity, believing God used mortal another planet attained Godhood too, multiple levels heaven. beliefs heretical Christianity.

I nothing Mormons actually quite admire devotion faith. Mormons Christians different putting category incorrect  BBC changed title twice. original title ""Child vaccine trial paused possible clot link"" Yup - keep rate we're going, think 6 weeks we've run adults willing show first shot. 70% adults point unless there's slowdown people going get one.  higher survival rate, actually.  guy Covids. True help. Ideally would want door open well cross breeze. cant US guns news? We’ve known two dose vaccines since start Agreed! using example many objects can/are touched. scenario leaving lots context like right life normal. basically trying say ""everything normal months want get back early X"".

The reason we're freaking much society still essentially operating normally. know it'll go back normal months. mechanism allow people get back normal sooner ahead actually wrapping pandemic.

So full perspective I'd edit statement to:

 “Society currently operating normally, end year. option let inject needle. agree, get back normal sooner, otherwise wait pandemic over.” recently checked Uk travel site don’t need negative COVID test you’re fully vaccinated. also facebook groups - NY Vaccine Help. got appointment well friends! People want help :) 11m thing happened weeks ago, reported recently. projections past couple weeks long since accounted it.

The 11m fact told J&amp;J got EUA would millions doses ready go, like 4m. It’s interchangeable dc residents. wait till 19th DC resident rip. HORRIBLE citations honest. lot pontificating based limited facts. Vaccines proven work every variant. Variants nothingburger. think UK government trying get every citizen holiday UK sake economy. far effect scheme push through. Millions people spending tens billions saved last 15 months. Can't say blame them, smart play support. course, drove price one week rent caravan Weymouth wrong side grand, play part. It’s surprising consider actual size tech sector well fact PNW kind island way. independent owner salon cuts hair this. And, rich one chair (her). Yet even resources knowledge buy two HEPA filters. One door one right chair I’ve hearing lot well. people going realize degree protection efficient better none? need keep proving vaccination status every day school - used once, register basically. 

We're talking education, basis able get career generate income. talking consumerism entertainment. 

People completely level-headed even already vaccinated Covid19 \*still\* see disadvantages dangers vaccine passports. 

Nobody attacking you, belittling you, insulting you. Yet feel like that's way assert superiority. gives? friends starting get (30+ NY) pleasantly surprised speed we've gotten first shot. remember taking quiz NYT website said basically dead last line got shot Feb. grateful. Hence *locker room funk* What? Why? get handle continuously let bumfucks around world keep reintroducing shitty variants? thanks didn’t say - it’s businesses receiving state money mentioned. please refuse state money!  hope forcing people photo ID racist... Jim Crow 2.0 Georgia... 


/s Even high school wrestling considered team sport, wrestle get points team, whichever team points wins.

PA finished wrestling season weeks ago. Possible ADULT clot link, case anyone worried kids trial. safety concerns trial guess cautious. said private businesses wish. going thing moves needle “not sure” crowd. uncle way getting vaccine learned couldn’t cruise without it. appt end month Identity politics. fully vaccinated child attend public school. fully vaccinated adult attend college university.

I see problem requiring people vaccinated order go lives pandemic killed 555,000 people *that know of* US. right answer. retail clean everything hour, also fancy purifier that’s proven kill Covid (not sure validity claim). point is, customers care purifying precautions, bringing fresh air using purifier, feel much safer see us cleaning. think pretty common sentiment, saying J&amp;J wack necessarily obviously excellent, also kind understand they're coming given data available? Never thought I'd even know anything vaccine companies, never mind preference, patron restaurant time soon.

Fine rest us. US, actually calling them, ""CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card"".  course, states using forms. 

Businesses require ""proof vaccination"", without specifying exactly kind document constitutes ""proof"". flexibility needed case, accommodate travelers get vaccinated states nations. think corporations able infringe civil liberties, beachfront property Utah sell you. still great, relative population large MI. Seriously!  Im vaccinated taken pandemic seriously.  havent seen family year draw line. Scary shit   Bad idea. lot people want go back normal would easiest fastest way. case follow doctor's advice call feel better soon something changes worse would rather pay bonuses administration staff. Covid *become* political *made* political Donald John Trump. knew start surface cleaning show. wash hands eating don’t lick doorknobs. possible adult* clot link.
So basically cases currently investigated.
Thanks misleading title. Flight, unfortunately haha One shot shown extremely effective preventing infection, transmission, serious effects 10 days. Roughly 80% effective number going 90% second dose. Remember aiming anything 50%. Like requiring children fully vaccinated attend public school, adults attend college university? able monitor level antibodies time, model antibodies eventually drop effective levels? really looks like Steve Rodgers title photo.  Yeah crazy. buildings empty YEAR now. Others least fairly empty summers. cant every HVAC pro town contract like weeks summer upgrading systems? feel like downplayed ventilation thing thats ""expensive hard problem"" solve. Easier hygiene theater temp taking ""deep cleaning."" modern tech really isn't, besides fuck schools systems upgraded 40 years first place? Like wonder germ factories.

A year ago understood, really know enough say much mattered. excuses. travelling, mask ask? driving, TN MS pretty much giving vaccine anyone. stop get J J, make vacation celebrate vaccine.

Or maybe way home try combine hangovers. arguing lost cause here. got accused anti-vaxxer despite saying single word vaccine. People seem unable fathom somebody pro-vaccination (I every single vaccine could get kid adult reasonable recommended state/country) still care privacy see sets peculiar precedent. 

You see fear-tactics carrot, namely granted entry restaurants movies, enough people stop caring rights freedoms. Yep. What's really sad OCD well control (at least me; disrupt life) brought full force.  easily make valid legal business case it’s unnecessary hire someone lives 1500 miles away home office go qualified local candidate.

You able to, position remote. 

If 2 guys who've applied remote position; one local, isn't, everything else same, there's valid reason picking one without interviewing first.

Either position local requires local candidates remote local *or* remote workers.

Anti-discrinination laws made stronger requiring employers discriminate based geographical location. could eliminate BS ""right work""

Will completely fix problem? Far it, need complete labor protections overhaul. like chain, weakest link breaks (right work) everything else falls apart.

Right now, anti-discrinination laws expanded, would fail ""oh, fire him/not hire he's 1500 miles away, uhhh, like attitude!""
It's far easy discriminate workers. far easy employers dick us around. Think poor nurses tho who'd listen thousands people like us make Bill Gates jokes 😶😅  Yeah us get mad internet people compulsively washing hands often whatever COVID 🤷 Alright come on.....this borderline fear mongering. act going back april 2020 deaths roof. old people vaccinated. rich countries even adults starting get vaccinated. Enough doomsday propaganda. Yes covid serious. stop acting society humans going extinct? Look FDA Pfizer vaccine: 

http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling.aspx?id=14472&amp;format=pdf

On first page says FDA approved vaccine prevent covid 19.  I'm saying people correct, I'm extremely skeptical live people unmasked private gatherings. Could people wearing masks going (e.g. grocery store), venues. Churches, gyms, restaurants, bars, many kinds private gatherings (wedding, parties, family events, etc.). Another thing CDC never finally made leap telling people masks we've wearing effective (especially 1- 2-layer cloth). better masks readily available KN95, KF-94, FFP2, etc. Even standard 3-layer surgical masks pretty good people would actually wear right. see 50% people wearing without even pushing nose wire around nose. gaps big enough bus drive through. cases sports, socializing locker room carpooling to/from practices games that's driving transmission.  outbreaks associated youth scholastic teams, they've almost always traced back kids going party socializing together outside organized controlled practices/competition. 

My kids play two sports year-round coach one teams responsible enforcing rules team. One sport classified low medium covid risk, medium.  Teams reduced eliminated locker room use mandate masking distancing sidelines - even playing without masks, *zero* covid exposures within leagues since last June sports allowed re-start initial lockdown.  exception masking, covid protocols followed kids' teams actually *more* stringent what's required school. 

Just waiting sports-hating Redditors (i.e. anyone who's ever non-ironically used term ""sportsball"") celebrate mere thought end team sports US...  college worked ass get J&amp;J students lot people saying aren’t going take think it’s “wack” inferior solely efficacy rate. Smh 🤦‍♂️ want know possible issue present adenovirus vaccines. Sorry, talking Anthony Fauci. Much easier make vast pronouncements without data next day contradict said. implication although virus many times smaller holes mesh mask, masks effective barrier transmitting disease droplets travel get caught mesh. travel aersolized mask useless, find countless videos online people smoking mask know exhalation lingers hours. presuming 'team sports' refers outdoor activity

No Congrats one place ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE where’s masks indoors. Nah I’m tipping someone behind counter hand food. Tipping gotten hand. someone isn’t bringing something me, they’re getting tip. can't admit link? would help science.

There shame messing bit causes one incident every per 100-300 thousand vaccinated people (and deaths).

It becomes guilty thing if:

A) analysed quickly so

B) people informed, doctors warned look it

C) thus evasive treatment protocols set up

Let's act like plane ever crashed. happens, luckily rarely, does, protocol analyze, cover sweep rug.  Thank much. think almost got jab yesterday! Texas, thing controls. never spot. spot, welcome it. said stay carantine folks something scary never said getting vaccine, I? said frequent business way privacy. demanding entry. want. vaccines international travel slightly different issue needing vaccine passport go grocery store restaurant. see difference sure tell you. Would love see US use extra doses vaccinate anyone wants vacation US. Stimulate economy vaccinate world simultaneously. Great response! lol! like you. actually older think played many video games since Atari 2600 crapped decades ago. mean thing. Give industries choices, like want see movie, concert, football game, eat indoors, etc, either utilize vaccine passport subject social distancing restrictions. would take vaccine passport public health would better it. maybe social distancing restrictions really minimal temporarily lifted times low transmission passport make sense. done smart way that's good business public health. Opposition people different stubborn toddlers. Tickets events single-use barcode. CDC vaccination cards markings uniquely identify whatsoever. least, one have. vaccine card would infinitely easier make convincing fake tickets event. Honest question, tennis wrestling even considered ""team sports""? know high schools wrestling ""teams"" thought individual sport get it. me, I'd rather enjoy 16 hours people want with. Pre-pandemic, never hear say things like ""TGIF!"" fun work every day. among early vaccinated cohort, assume mainly elderly vulnerable, three deaths 200 infections really positive 

Anecdotally speaking people still needing ICU care post-vaccination elderly young people severe immunosuppression. high vaccination rate extremely important. I'm professional field, apologies using complete sentences reddit none even matters lol BAD! Anyway, vaccine ID cards. carry ya There's certainly fear, Canada, US sent us 1.5million AZ doses last week; gone quickly live British Columbia. Forgive silly question, mean who've taken AZ vaccine? in, sibling young, healthy (id say) female- still safe? worry?

There's many different articles can't figure what's false not, say there's link others say I’m sorry needle phobia. used it. start injecting medication really difficult get phobia. Horrible times. 

If truly antibodies, urge least get tested it. guess also involves needles. feel would simpler phobia getting vaccine, don’t antibodies, that’s another needle you’re gonna anxiety about. 

My initial comment pointing invalid medical knowledge COVID-19. It’s flu. Full stop. I’m discussing further. went calling stupid bad person, never called whatsoever. 

Let’s say isn’t logic you’re correct. rule stands businesses uphold this. would illogical, like many rules throughout life. Doesn’t mean it’s going enforced. It’s illogical like phobia. Doesn’t mean isn’t real. Doesn’t make sense domestic travel ought require arriving international passengers. downvoted LOL Yep, supply finally issue US. Still little bit bottleneck administration imagine resolve rather soon 3 million shots day take long run people high demand vaccine. would imagine long tail kids (12-16) become eligible vaccine hesitant people much rush get vaccine get vaccinated several months. One would assume bottlenecks nothing delivered vaccine doubling deliveries doubles vaccination rate. increased deliveries increase vaccination speed (proportionally) everywhere. CNN's variant coverage deplorable. poor coverage vaccine rollout instead focusing things like UK variant variant become ""vaccine-resistant"". nearing end coming sooner every vaccine that's distributed. hear religious categories names artificial poorly chosen, enough shared traits Islam, Christianity, Judaism ability name group useful! case here, idea categorizing someone member religion despite identifying one pretty distinctive trait. study Greco-Roman religion (similarly terrible category name, similarly necessary conversations) idea arguing whether someone counted believer makes zero sense context, strikes distinctive.

Christianity's attempts continue categorize monotheistic rather polytheistic interesting core question, gets pretty dicey try use qualifying test. needed giant council Nicaea clear question! Plenty Arian heresy branches disagreed it, clearly Christian social historical terms. plenty unquestionably Christian sects treat Mary saints exactly way polytheistic religions treat minor divinities. Monotheism super interesting philosophical topic terrible place draw line who's Christian. Like said. Definitely evangelical Christians. believe Jesus, don’t like call Christian, right line. And, understand evangelical Christians Catholics refer Christians. someone else pointed out... holiday weekend, screws reporting. 

Still, deaths coming now. take one specific day odd reporting better actually. name reference American dad? Interesting, make clear I'm basing thoughts entirely anecdotal evidence guess take I'm saying grain salt. Maybe try seeing come LA dose though. I've heard repeated times people already covid, first dose vaccine feels like second dose feels everyone else, i.e. shitty. Hopefully symptoms last day second dose cakewalk you. takes 2 seconds put take mask. pita? that's Republicans still trying kiss ring. way matters topic, even issue. Businesses would swiftly told attorneys courts can't that'd end it. Yet are. got Pfizer yesterday. yard work right couple hours arm sore injection site. moving around might make better. Today I’m little fatigued that’s it. 5G nice though. scientific source pretty consistent messaging. Media dumbs average American understand problem. 

The last six months constant assaults ""Pfizer 21 days Moderna 28 days"" many people worried would happen vaccine 20 days, 27 days, 35 days, etc.

I know several people worked clinical trial last year. number stupid questions get people ""have done research"" absolute bullshit staggering. mean, it’s guaranteed won’t hospitalized die, couldn’t care less going new ""Immunity lasts 3 months"". wait two weeks, get worse

I've waiting ""just two weeks"" two half months now. going get worse?

Stop doom saying. Sorry? saying anything worry two deaths US? Please show proof attacks. seems like confusing someone else.

Also, insulting mature. Thx.

Also, never stated anything talk super deadly variants unlikely, even according experts. course they'll remain cautious realize virus endless amount deadly permutations sleeve, anxiety levels better. 

Why would choose commit character assassination without proof read something posts there, think I'll ever understand. risk leaving virus long enough let mutate strain current vaccines / antibody's work on. That's risk non-vaccine way, nullify progress get here. That's vaccinating everyone (in world) best way reduce likelihood vaccine resistant strain never answered seriously think year 2037 we're going show covid vaccine eat McDonalds? that's sounds like think happen.

The stuff anyways part. Making sure people food Christmas seems like good idea. Making sure proper ventilation prevent disease makes sense too.

There argument made budgets afford it. that's saying.

You're making hypothetical slippery slope argument something honestly makes sense. actual motivation would even actual authoritarian government making vaccine passport permanent order dine McDonald's without mask thing?

Can actually lay logic would happen? Plenty scientists believe lockdowns, think question intelligence then. quick Google CDC vaccination card pdf see hard find blank card. Got full page results them. ones top government public websites CDC Missouri Department Health (I Googled states able find file every state website looked). around download download directly government websites. technically wouldn’t even need HVAC improvements. you’d move air HEPA filter side. That’s basically planes. Hahahaha, kidding... Whatever takes Yikes, easter weekend gonna make numbers look low next days. supply still tight orange county. think probably Easter Weekend many got vaccinated. Yep worse company something called ""hoteling"" entire floors open first come first serve. Woof. usually hot desk office / team, sometimes get thrown ""the hotel, motel, holiday inn."" city: 57 up! lol mean people saying we’re going end death camps hyperbole 

no shit - yet i'm told i'm wrong LOL. kk. 'buts' goal posts needed, saying anything else automatically stem logical, temporary next step hysterical. Xfinity internet cable data caps well owns content creation NBC. data provide count cap provide streaming service free. 
 
It's hard see economic advantage provide pipes content unless competitor spends money quality content would use free service? think it’ll evolve mask mandate gets dropped. California tracks well country. time get jun 15, 50% country fully vaccinated. Israel shows us 50% fully vaccinated, cases drop drastically. 

At 50% fully vaccinated, think people stop wearing one it’ll discretion places still want masks not. Except everything open, become restrictive. employment literally kind employment allows work fully home... Right. elderly aren’t hospitalized much anymore OC makes clear. time, elderly hospitalized. 

Hospitalizations pretty much flat right (excellent news) *could* get bumpy locations next 4 weeks so, although Fauci doesn’t currently think it’ll major problem nationwide. like needles. That's is. phobia. irrational nature. 

I'm getting vaccine. I'm 90% positive I'm carrying antibodies worked bar 2020. people getting vaccinated. Herd immunity stop spread. 

I said toxic asshole toxic asshole. stand it. point insult myself, read wrote. child. insulted every comment written, including one. 

My medical history nobody's business mine. government wants mandate get vaccine, sure, I'll get it. would to. point inject something body go disney world. feel like going, expect there, way likely banning unvaccinated people actually illegal. unless make new legislation quickly, making fake vaccine card definitely illegal, since there's never thing. we're going point we're making fake pass illegal, might well government mandate take vaccine. 

There's absolutely logic banning unvaccinated people optional take it. really skeptical majority vaccinated June. access sure. Get vaccinated? doubt it. Sure, go? Europe open yet. 
It's matter quarantining return, quarantining arrive well. 
 
Vaccine passport might help that, rules seem bit air moment. believe God father God mother; sex heaven produce spirit children, wait bodies inhabit earth (fetuses); Jesus first child, Satan second, problems earth due Satan wanting earth kingdom, instead Jesus's; Jesus God earth only, exceptional Mormon, get God planet, produce spirit babies wife inhabit it. There's also counsel gods space, discuss rule worlds. 
Does sound way like mainstream Christian belief? Oh, levels heaven, inhabited God, Jesus, holy spirit; can't get God's level unless mormon. definitely go hell leave Mormon church. 

A fundamental belief Christians God, Jesus, holy spirit three parts being, one God, creation, circumstances human become god; Satan's oldest temptation. Cotton rice?

Realistically, odds virus could survive outside mammal host long enough actually get someone sick? CDC reporting deliveries 11.3 million doses today. shoutout days couldnt find clorox wipes solid 7 months *Rubs hands dreaming low-wage foreign workforce* Thank 💖💖 everyone happy healthy complaints maybe little world /r/coronavirus inside head?

but real world proof vaccine required multiple places multiple things multiple countries long, long time. living rock trying clutch fakest pearls? 

methinks latter, hence original comment. love nutballs downvoting though. please, keep validating correctness. media pushed narrative vaccinated individuals still carry spread virus lmao. What’s wrong JnJ lol? would consider looking another school shoes. Nope, it’s right article. discussion Chinese vaccines. article linked also talks efficacy Chinese vaccines. admit link don’t know causes it? It’s example things made permanent. would stop there? would logic? Started massive surplus Bakersfield, tons appointments Dodger Stadium people technically eligible getting doses. I've also multiple friends technically eligible get shots various pharmacies around city. They're cheating system point, they've totally clear they're eligible they're getting shots anyways. Work school built 50s. schools district got air upgrades initial lockdown. one month ago side effects lasted 2 days me, chills, fever fatigue. Best luck! got Pfizer'd two hours ago. Feeling significant arm numbness/muscle soreness brain gets 5G side effects. Two questions: go walk enjoy nice spring weather, risk exacerbating side effects? take edible tonight, interfere vaccine all? Would difficult implement given 4-5 week window shots Moderna Pfizer. Lol clicked link included terrible things providing free school meals home holidays. 

These measures seem make common sense, like planning next pandemic adding better ventilation systems, allowing virtual access court rooms even future. negatives here? Looks like headline bait me. MAYBE argue budget problem force things like making sure poor people eat Christmas see that's ""authoritarian"". means, [correlation mean People get vaccine getting clotting issues, know vaccine another factor. entirely possible protection last longer 6 months.

This massive understatement. almost assured protection last substantially longer 6 months. **have** say ""at least 6 months"" data for, shots going wear quickly. one that's ""less annoying"" one nonexistent me. Whether bar asks proof immunization ask wear shirt. Private business right. right patronize them

Asking immunization records travel otherwise expose hundreds people events (concerts/parties/airplanes) totally right private entities running events. already need immunization records travel multiple countries already (especially endemic diseases like yellow fever dengue). new. may helpful CDC recently issued updated travel advisory. heavily hints think vaccinated people spread it. take science yet looking positive. Yes, show proof vaccination wear mask entire time.

Honestly, wish kidding. Challenge: exactly “A B”? words, think you’ll see doesn’t make sense.

This multiplicative probability: probability B.  Specifically probability (not infected first time) B (not infected second time) etc etc.

P(A B) = P(A) * P(B)

I think words make easier. could try numbers makes sense you. come answer cumulative risk touching surface 10,000 times?  Show step step working.  bet either final number doesn’t make sense you’re using multiplication (not addition).  That's great hear. California hell time last 15 months, especially SoCal hospitals. No, stating asking proof vaccination automatically lead other, hyperbolic things, jack hysterical claim does. love i'm downvoted right, usual. #2 like way think. could claimed in-state tuition staying college... *thumbs-up* /s We've 3 stop b.117 taking entire classrooms school. There's lot people bother needing book appointment online, people computer savvy enough figure book it. think walk-in appointments available, lot people want bother difficulty booking walk pharmacy get it. another 1/3 never cared catching all. 1/3 vaccine eligible within month. Thank bringing up, didn’t see even close type drop deaths major holiday entire year. don’t know people refuse celebrate good news. Conservative. California tracks well terms percentages country whole. It’s likely Memorial Day day California country. Great news!

Though wish media would represent better. tell mom ""no, shot wear six months, said people they've tested still protected six months. good thing!"" work out/lift weights, definitely keep moving arm. Gently stretch careful massage helps too. Heating pad helped me, one available lay arm. Also *highly* recommend drinking lot water. Yeah, calling ""fully"" reopened disingenuous best. 

So long keep mask mandates require vaccine verification indoor events, think that's way accurate descriptor.

Honestly, sounds less like real end date like desperate PR governor scared hell he's going get recalled. Sure thing champ. fucking hate Texans too.

Feel free provide source contradict. continue talking ass caps lock on. Almost 76% one shot now! getting close done thing. Except don't. love comment gets immediately removed incivility, can’t refrain continuing make absurd comments. 

We’re done here. blocked, longer see gaslighting comments. 

Good luck getting around vaccine passports though. Why? I'd go J&amp;J primarily that's first one get. bit lower efficacy ""at risk"" group easily choose two saving higher efficacy risk groups altruistic thing well. Going J&amp;J also mean fully vaccinated sooner nice benefit. Got second Pfizer jab 3 hours ago. feel fine far, I'm waiting shoe drop (as far feeling like shit). ""I need TV doctor""

And is.

Not single post single fact absolutely nothing offer platitudes. Educate yourself. almost 76% 65+ year olds. good see, must reporting issues remember stuck around 70% days back. 

85% seems possible wonders amount deaths/hospitalizations. assume might tied ID even diligent enough people find workaround Effective now, far less effective least one them.

No speculation all. family viruses causes common cold. long present eventually overturn vaccination. really think so? started get feeling never going get 50% vaccinated. people seemed care covid. changed live forced. care covid, would bothered enough go get vaccine? see happening. even think anything antivax. think people care enough. 

Maybe I'm pessimistic though. Covid made lose faith people. cause Denmark planning everyone done mid-July UK end. sort looks like we'll finish around time, despite everything happened beginning year.

Of 1.8 million fully vaccinated, 246 gotten positive 3 died.

Cases Deaths per 100,000:



- | Vaccinated | Vaccinated
---|---|----
Cases | 1.3 | 245
Deaths | .02 | 4.2

I'm sure gaslighting talking about. 95% effective means exactly that. Hi measles, mumps rubella! It’s while, how’ve ya been? people never looked say feel without knowing anything. current feeling everything going wrong slowly, expect continue forever. take away threat Covid, what’s different versus 2019? what’s solution? Lock forever? know that, seen cards? Mine like...a 3/4 card CVS lady wrote date Pen. People forge super easily. guess point anything faked though there's gonna level ""scouts honor"" this.   Quick correction mask part. heavily depends season go. go heavy pollen season Japan, dust season South Korea, would see high mask usage, air really breathable w/out mask times. Similarly China, dust gets bad, need masks unless looking cough every time breath.

The reason Asian countries tons mask usage mainly due pollen/dust. became ten times efficient.

i think thats lie lol. SURE state working home helped efficiency. people still working jobs? course... sheesh. getting people reply emails 9 PIA. Covid may care day people reporting data do. 20 states didnt even report cases Sunday, let alone deaths. clear results artificially lowered lack submitted data. NY probably give timelines reopening announce announce fully re-opening tomorrow. human decency? That’s interplay throughout whole thing. Good point Texas law regarding took inspiration Scott Atlas architect federal government Health Human Services Centers Disease Control herd immunity strategy. Yes Moderna isn’t company working booster. mentioned Moderna already human trials booster shots. Pfizer AstraZeneca already working boosters, Novavax well. think case South Africa, they’d likely invest Pfizer Novavax booster. perhaps two dose regiment J&amp;J vaccine  blasé civil rights strange... answer why, even authoritarian government, would require covid vaccine passports go McDonald's?

It's like can't already track us via cell phones access information already as-is. see real benefit one even fully evil dictatorship. Interesting. age group she? 

The government expects everyone vaccinated first week July. old young. last group (people 18 39 years old) receive invitations old young starting end June, youngest group (18 year olds) vaccinated beginning July. 

So might benefit getting shot US July, unless planning take vaccine Netherlands already planning go US anyways.  Michigander here. still 800k cumulative covid cases sitting around 36% state population least one vaccine dose. think states success early pandemic summer 2020 what’s leading explosion unfortunately. simply way people never exposed Uk variant it’s raging currently.  doesn't, we'll better conservatives Florida. Also mortgage means house, small 1 bedroom apartment. presenting least onerous version idea vaccine proof, completely rejecting authoritarian scenarios involve tracking behavior, people opposed vaccine passports actually opposing. can't live 21st century pretend governments around world using scarily dystopian tracking measures citizens, let alone private industry. work. weren’t afraid existing diseases Covid, scared now?  dont get paid enough :/ mean choice would take shot AZ. That's statistically tiny blood clotting bollocks though, protect variants like South African variant well. given option AZ nothing, I'll go AZ heartbeat. person fully vaccinated, it’s selfish. masking it’s irrational. go ahead. masks work? would US care? Even die-hard anti-Cuban government voters Florida would fine giving Cuba vaccines considering it’s family members risk. Alternatively, conflated ""maintain social distancing least 6 feet wear mask"". doth protest much I’m getting J&amp;J shot Friday! governor eased health dept said nah leadership changed. ted nugent said, FREE ! Kyle great lately.

He's especially bad comes Covid. politicians made COVID response campaign topic. 

Every time one seriously convinced cannot sink lower get ready another round underwhelming incolpetence. Thank caring others. fine long run. “Not employers want employees return.” Fixed ya. pay rent office space ability hire people countries pay lower wages bet want “new normal.” whole “Great Reset” nothing corporate wet dream. original comment thread easy piece paper fake. people suggested phones. people mentioned issues tying system phone, workaround suggest printing paper. we're back started then. sure realistic would be, want 2 days vacay wasted feeling weather. maybe folks countries desperate vaccine get kind vaccine tourism thing going on. We'll see Yes that's right, making clear /u/dr_buzzed correct saying title misleading. denying claim earlier official, ""EMA studies able figure AZ lead blood clots individuals"" per comment come conclusion AZ cause blood clots, question why, still trying determine causal link. news result second dose administred 12 weeks first dose? Yep agreed Right, forgot California Asia. Tell report CDC let know earth actually sphere. deaths probably get reported properly. Sundays always low reporting. Holidays always lower reports. Combined numbers artificially low, even though think turned corner numbers drop form occasional blip there. Awesome! Thank efforts! quite follow reasoning. agree likely need form vaccine negative result enter country sure get WH saying vaccine passports. ""Studies throughout pandemic consistently find 30% infections resulting long-term effects potentially heading towards mass debilitation event big portion population won’t able work full time require additional medical care.""

[Citation needed] still hang them, CDC said vaccinated people likely spread virus. friend willing take risk vaccinated, surely care either way, neither tbh. mention time zones! Simple conversations drag days wait X hours person wakes get response, *they* wait another X hours *you* wake respond back. would love real thing. anti-vax/mask/Covid crowd attacks encompasses biggest &amp; lowest morons assholes banned place sign up! got fine without masks Covid, go back it’s over? really sound like much change keep mask mandate still ban super large gatherings could guarantee never leaving house choice mind 2 shots, pfizer much data efficacy. Pfizer gold standard right now. risk close zero. Perhaps try talk test trip concerned.  Check CVS midnight. That's scheduled mine days ago today (just got shot hours ago!!). pretty consistent appointment drops every night midnight 3 4 days out. downvoted, agree. I've seeing even sub-- large amount people say bother getting vaccinated dont open normal right away. lot people tend side individualist thought, vaccinations broadly collective activity. think context missing Moderna, pandemic, early stage biotech startup absolutely zero experience commercializing vaccine. manufacturing infrastructure set help US government, result, Moderna's production plans reflect US centric approach since that's money prioritization came from.

Now US vaccination effort path success, expect Moderna refocus supplying rest world. would surprise see cost reductions capacity increases serve middle low-income countries, possibly help US government prioritize 'vaccine diplomacy'.

I read anything specific effort produce booster shot yet. Certifying booster takes months, they're starting process parallel learning whether existing shot effective. end needing one, available ready; don't, harm wasted resources conducting trial.

In words, South Africa - really rest world general - simply priority Moderna upfront, trying focus actually getting vaccine certified produced US market. Expect changes going forward expand focus. need phone, print QR code go theme park. keep closed... logged ask managed misspell vaccine names. different past?

This like frog saying, ""He's already cranked 70 degrees 71 degrees. What's 1 degree going hurt?"" wonder feel schools, example, requiring vaccinations pre-pandemic?

If school funded taxes, school requiring vaccinations. work support staff tbh, many old guard want us back office get lot attention support staff (but pay salaries.) home probably limit spouses (like getting someone phone them, making copies, typing shit, etc) want come back ""staff"" boss around delegate work to, thus feel important again. 


That big corner office fun one around see sitting it. probably last reply. either trying understand, deliberately trying mislead. entire response criticizes wrong formula use, use reply. Please pay closer attention.

Again, talking understand probability, I'd willing bet degree mathematics. 

Again, look formula. understand it, say so. change something else, criticize it, claim I'm wrong. 

Again, criticize math. simply said risk additive, is, something called additive rule probability. 

By way, even though apparently understand formula posted, I'll inform approach formula equivalent arrive answer. approach degenerative form general formula, listed. many days first shot became infected? know it’s guess. Glad good recovery! Yeah, feel like it'll business business. There's way hell bars going able enforce this. feel like mask thing kinda people things open up. I'm sure there'll always people want it, people definitely still antibodies? good lesson statistics, great example cant extrapolate unrepresentative friendship circle.

The survey also 640 people one single county. exactly indicative entire population. agree. efficacy drops ton fiddle drink/eat. Ultimately, large venues make ton concessions can’t imagine they’ll able generate enough revenue stay open long term without them. So, either nix mask together events concessions sold (when safe so) save others ton hassle enforce real mask mandates without eating drinking. silly in-between business abets harmful narratives people generally made masking. me. going vaccinated cruses restaurants soon wife excited sign up. 

The nice thing masks anti-covid/vax crowd generally attracts biggest dumb asses, assholes unintelligent go somewhere bans morons I’ll take number antibodies detected matter effectiveness?

My elementary understanding immune system body ever encounters virus future memory cells would greatly ramp production antibody keep getting sick.

If antibody test Measles. expect number near zero also still immune it? Imagine 1 year ago thinking ahead would thankful pandemic. Felt like madhouse around back then. What? wear mask mean stores closed? got hives itching first Pfizer shot. I’ve recommended follow Johnson Johnson. ANYONE also done experience? wish could post somewhere greater visibility. Would like hear doctors whose patients might instructed this. Seems like J&amp;J shot already comes flu symptoms others friends said.... even low chance medium chance get blood clots would take care live die care protect others fortunately containment state people think wearing mask impediment freedoms lol Honestly, no. either safe pack club isn't. worried, go club. mean, thanks lengthy response responding comment Moderna already testing boosters, believe Pfizer well. 

I jus stating Moderna’s original vaccine appears much efficacious B1.135 compared Chinese vaccines. goes Pfizer given high degree similarity vaccines. 

I’d say South Africa decent supply Pfizer vaccines won’t really need Moderna vaccines. I'm fully vaccinated two week immunity buildup, reason can't hang friend vaccinated get vaccinated? Trying understand vaccinated means terms getting spreading covid. Especially planning memorial day gathering. friends fully vaccinated there's one be. Thanks Thanks :) naked disregard unvaccinated children

Children less unaffected Covid, disregarding considering public health policies right move. Yeah, also reason I’m competing. Title article EU drug agency denies already finding causal link

With first sentence being: Europe’s drug regulator denied already established causal connection

That reads bit different than: EMA denies finding causal link Hi, sorry, allow people claim medical professionals without verification -- feel free message modmail want verified! Possibly sooner that, assuming talking US. \~8 weeks, enough vaccines 80% adults US. Polling currently indicates 62% adults take vaccine soon possible. Another 18% ""wait see"", another 7% take required. think we'll start see demand issues sometime late April early May ""as soon possible"" group mostly vaxxed up.  posted Europe sub. yes/no positive, get information level immunity have?

Also, good school.

I still can't even get appointment mine bay. Granted I'm age group yet, hurt ask.

Beyond that, friends nurse Kaiser who's giving vaccines fairly convinced keep getting amount they're getting now, enough make dent demand April 15 rolls around, since vaccine still sent LA Fresno.  Europe actually exporting vaccines India. Same

It's CDC card name dates hand written it, special codes markings. think Newsom lift mask mandate (and when) CDC says so. fact, see lot left-wing states that. 

I don’t know that’ll sooner later. I'm surprised see Texas absent list. denial COVID19 even exists, idea fake disease created liberal media destroy Trump, ""patriots"" attacking shops enforcing mask policies, corrupt governor opening state back time Spring Break, would expect see numbers soaring. Found Mr. Reddit guys what’s point? genuinely don’t know masks still required everyone wants vaccine gets vaccinated (more doable june). San Diego LA stretch coast chock full Republicans would happily turn California Kentucky means make money. 

La Jolla cesspool humans. It’s perfect still think PBS Newshour pretty good job Let introduce friend called “reality”.

What article outline won’t ever happen. I’m sorry way would ever happen across globe let alone US. think it’s fair question state thinks gatherings 60,000 fine, still wants people wear masks. 

It’s implying don’t 100% trust vaccines, should. 

We vaccines get us herd immunity. opportunity every Californian get shot next 45 days. think it’s crazy question masks needed beyond that.

Also, don’t see people criticizing mask mandates moment. hypothetical two months future. Wanna hear something crazy. Covid aerosolizes (which does) ice rinks (as ice) absolute worst sports fields on. There’s well documented effect cold air sits concentrated fills sink way floor glass remaining mostly stagnant. made switch Zambonis propane electric. crap ton people getting sick started investigate years back. It’s interesting haven’t telling people get n95 masks unfortunate Or, want better prepared next time. Think much lower death toll would there'd abundant supply comfortable high-quality masks hand early 2020. *lot* people who'd benefit unending mask mandate, think state politicians amongst them. Lol wanna visit manchester see united play. Hope face off! see. mercy, either? Unvaccinated, whatever reason, allowed live restricted life? Gotcha. 

And throw something IQ. Sure. 

You really clue sound like. Heh. long ago, past 24 months, would asbestos contaminated soil garden beds local school. school 10-15 years old. Garden beds years old. Well vaccinating commuters? Political theater. live idiocracy sure. God bless America. US israel parts middle east suppose I'm guessing state government waiting CDC issue guidance one, limit exposure. end world erode public trust give specific benchmarks mask mandates lifted. 

 problem masks objectively prevent spread disease, always reason mandate even X% population vaccinated. everyone asking stop wearing nobody giving anyone straight answer.

Can surprised people getting frustrated suspicious ""new normal""? moment data collected Pfizer Isreal seems indicate fully vaccinated individuals healthy face narrow chance picking covid, even extremely mild.

That said chance getting covid zero. make call yourself.

\*\* medical professional. Jesus christ.

The fact type realize fucking ridiculous dangerous precedent makes comfortable making decisions Cheers. Hope everywhere gets pandemic soon. Stay safe. far american sanity fallen flat earth idiots. many vaccines Pfizer expect ship US Q2? source would also nice. saying ""Texas lifted mask mandate nothing happened"" evidence mask mandate effect. expiration statewide mandate really change anything. five metro areas (Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin, El Paso) kept mandates municipal buildings. Clearly that's different widespread enforcement, cities still signaling residents keep wearing masks. metro-area restaurants also still require masks well table. Major corporations (Walmart, airlines, Target, Costco, etc.) kept mask mandates well, apply cities small towns alike.

Has significant drop mask adherence? imagine nothing really changed: small towns continued wear masks, even state mandate existed, large cities continue wear masks despite expiration. thing could changed people wearing masks outside public, scenario spread covid already tiny. me, seems like mask mandate still force intents purposes, exception public spaces. gone public private enforcement.

I'm pretty neutral mask mandates, food thought. reached crest, know crest permanent yet. think think need minimum another two months deaths remaining low really know good go go back normalcy. means concerts masks well better concerts isnt it?

We can't go back normal every time things start looking reason three waves. clearly winning strategy. Surprising Michigan one five hotbed states, four highly populated states, etc. really. summers anywhere 35-42 degrees peak. classroom fans, bullshit. we'll get govt know it'll successful program! Smart move. Yep kinda figured metro CSU, believe SFstate similar plan here.

I went Poly SLO they're planning go back normal online class offerings, massive pressure school city bring students back economic reasons. city half retirees half students, guess half spends cash gaggle bars restaurants throughout city? hey, thanks. best. 100% opposed vaccine shaming. shots arms better, difficulty getting shots shitty online systems NY offered (and 3 systems, one pharmacies, one city run sites one state sites) often meant likely competing trash arm. think advantage wealthier people working home meant could hawk often websites, often crashed, list appointments actually existed. everyone luxury staying home day. need cast blame here.

Wear mask half time? restaurant's I've to, walk door mask, talk hostess, go seat, mask comes around bunch people without masks (only workers masked whole time). whole thing joke, basically. what? that's point, right? slowing spread virus enough even though vaccinated people getting sick. [There 2.1 million people age 65 1.9 million vaccinated age group February, would expect much less hospitalization age group. slightly lower compared last wave. want peace mind, get tested! also allergy season.

edit: saw three weeks ago. pretty well protected point, like better would flu vaccines. saw \~80 percent protection two weeks, still get tested worried, hopefully gives peace mind. Vaccine free everyone....for now. country also quarantine laws. problem administration spine implement election year, even global pandemic.  Nothing authoritarianism. 6 hours first moderna shot already feeling fatigued, arm incredibly sore head throbbing even know got 'from roommate'? interact anyone else months? need enough people vaccinated reach herd immunity protect genuinely cannot vaccinated due compromised immune system medical reason. nephew Russell Silver Syndrome makes imunocompromised, contracting covid would likely fatal. essentially isolated enough population vaccinated squash virus.

Also, allowing large percentage population simply choose vaccinate selfishly choose ignorance allow spread virus continue among people, gives opportunity mutations, puts rest us risk.

You’re labeling people fit narrative. downvotes show one going take seriously that. asked simple question brought politics it. already provide passports. need vaccine records NUMBER things daily life too. get privacy issue, saying vaccine admitting AIDS something. dealing virus puts others risk, yourself, actions cause death sickness someone else, make little sacrifice greater good everyone.

Maybe said AZ, there's near-zero chance P1 evade Pfizer likely Moderna even one-dose. Fine understand...but taking variants seriously need right now. know good news. am, hospital ICU's filling beyond capacity cases tripled weeks taking huge dip barely month ago. variants real.

It’s asshole evangelical pastors making bullshit  There’s still tons people vulnerable disease.

Tons haven’t caught it, tons vaccinated.

B1.1.7 example mutation higher IFR. Sure handle current vaccines, tamp completely variants still pop lovely combination vaccine evasion higher IFR.

As CDC's estimates, raised 0.65% (0.0065) July. raised last week give overall number. Instead, IFR estimates rose age group except 17. 9% IFR 29th 2021: (how's source that's going lean left) crunched numbers recent estimate got 0.8% IFR.  Would still able get vaccine passport? Alcohol prohibited, obviously protected way voting is. idea talking about. wouldn’t shocked localized spikes populations vaccine hesitant. don’t think so, I’m wrong lot. Hi Michigan. almost worst ever been. Spike here

E: bad. essentially bad ever far daily new cases. takes 4 shots measles vaccine give kids reach level immunity we’re seeing 2 doses mRNA vaccines None technically approved, they're emergency use authorized (same vaccines) Good know.  I'll day 19 get 2nd Pfizer later week.  May possible ass kicking occur. also blame made political. Though ultimately them. think issue fucking everyone's already made appointments... Nov - COVID bronchitis chaser. bad.

Had first dose Moderna couple weeks ago. Arm hurt tired. That's it.

2nd shot still come..... feel like trying cull population ~~lockdowns, masks and~~ vaccines like. people can't get vaccine? mean small number...like tiny. 100% agree sad. wished everyone really can't medical reasons would get vaccine.

There however inconvenient truth admitted. experts think COVID around long-term like flu. means people can't get vaccinations probably catch eventually matter many people get vaccinated right now. always heightened risk, especially first exposure. That's I'm hopeful create extremely effective oral drug fight COVID someone catches it. many claims....so little evidence Again, using lower efficacy vaccine requires two doses small portion population received two doses. Sinovac’s efficacy something like 50% *both* doses. Pfizer’s efficacy 80% preventing *asymptomatic infection* *one* dose. 

Sinovac much less effective vaccine Chile isn’t anywhere near close vaccinated even high priority groups fully. Fast rollout = / = everyone protected anyone young normal immune system. Either Anti-Vaxers young people point. Also keep mind post game spread would happen week two now, look like ton people there. labor test came back positive 183au/ml AZ, whichever rapid test try gives back negative results. trust quantitative labor tests, nothing else. Whilst partly agree, run risk helping create new variant taking hospital bed could saving somebody less selfish 78% hospitalized people overweight doesn’t sound significant compare rate overweight general population. 73% Americans classified overweight! Real talk! doctors basically gave finger teachers staff return person back august without vaccine. self serving constantly changing narratives it’s hard pay attention anymore Two weeks, right? People immunosuppressants get vaccine, know work us yet. allowed initial trials. lot thousand us. risk find acceptable take stage game. high-risk vaccinated months now.

I'm Texas (the DFW area specific) plenty people acting like over. Even Rangers game full capacity, plenty places COVID could spread amongst population. fact deaths/hospitalizations trending downwards makes think we're ready start returning normalcy. Even pandemic over, going wear mask crowded places winter. must rare species I've never met real lefty US. left center conservative Europe UK provided data \~ 2 months Pfizer. vaccine they're using effective. Unfortunate really mystery.

This one cases headline sends different message article. argument article that, since Chile yet vaccinated, early open they're lock again, lesson UK reopen prematurely. think fall/winter another outbreak? Worse typical flu season? take specific antibodies test spike protein? Like abbot quant spike protein test? Also time, family member live quarantine well. approved monoclonal. clinical trial compassionate use- approved. trouble understanding?

A variant strain. Imagine spineless rat change position based new evidence presenting itself. Outrageous. article written middle schooler? methaphor end wild. per IHME rate mask-wearing states higher Europe's continental average. full 10% higher states Germany UK equal France's rate gives us better shot 

I see COVID testing free/covered insurance certain circumstances others. One ""not other"" situations want test non-medical reason, like needing negative test travel. selling COVID tests, promising give particular result. It’s interesting seeing topics previously discussed among people “anti lockdown/Mandatory NPI” see light day mainstream circles. Better late never guess. 

I remember summer, people complaining elderly people allowed visitors, die millions US every year. Many could see anyone knew death COVID policies. fact it’s still going vaccine doesn’t surprise one bit. hopefully public opinion media actually writing it, policies go away. Keep u posted. It’s gonna banger wear mask eating ortolan anyway? Millions children 16 y.o. accepted risk. Anyone can't medically take vaccine accepted risk. Hence need herd immunity. whole problem anti-vaxxers, covid otherwise. look forward reading peer reviewed study. There's essentially correlation government restrictions case curves, scale (city, state, country, region). Never been. 

Maybe that's somewhat true US, definitly rest world. compare Sweden neighbours, countries extremely similar other. Yet one went much fewer restrictions, ten times many deaths Norway Finland three times many Denmark, despite much less dense. clearly shows difference lockdowns made Ireland. French ministers ‘are among guests risking jail 

They risking anything. truly law.  Updated U.S. vaccination rate age chart: (static image: 1/3 U.S. population least one dose, \~19% fully vaccinated!** causes second third waves then? 40 50% ""superspreaders"" infected therefore resistant driving subsequent peaks? stands Discredited. school building age ventilation systems? deaths per day Covid (7-day moving average), Jan 23, 2021: **1250**

Average deaths per day Covid (7-day moving average), Mar 25, 2021: **75**

Average deaths per day Covid (7-day moving average), Ap 4, 2021: **34**

Death rate **97.3%** peak, still dropping rapidily.

That's highly effective vaccine vaccination program does. ""I need 20 years results before..."" crowd would fail risk management course. The, ""let's get months see"" crowd seems like acceptable caution. 
But, answer ""No way, how"" closed-minded. lol got scolded employee bar walking 10ft bathroom without mask near anyone.

Meanwhile theres 20+ maskless people &lt; 1000 sqft space bar talking loudly other. exactly. never respect single covid 19 restriction again, especially i’m vaccinated We’re central TX. live near bunch Oak trees Oak pollen time high right now. Husband suffering bit well he’s already fully vaccinated. Hoping current mild malaise due pollen allergies/Monday blues due poor nights sleep. Might get tested early Wednesday depending feel. positive 7 months,mild symptoms, yesterday done antibody test Negative result. still bigger protection people never covid? reinfection less severe? I’m 24, question time someone infect me, since work people constantly refuse wearing masks etc.thx I’m 6 days too, vaccine buddies! Lol God hope there’s good news vaccine once, anxiety killing too! much tax money went study? Cuz could’ve told u much.  state’s population grew 0.05%, 0.23% prior year. total population stands 39.78 million people. 
The latest estimate came California Department Finance covers change population July 1, 2019, July 1, 2020.

Most populous states:

1. CA - 39.37 Million
2. TX - 29.36 Million
3. Anyone identifies leftist US usually going closer pure socialism/Marxist. Maybe don’t shoehorn country 300 million people narrow worldview, friend. specifically referring kids old enough get vax now. 
It makes sense wait younger results released vetted experts younger. Come think it, never much even .... idea contracting via touch left mind completely June. refuse overly sanitized lifestyle. fair compare 21 days 1st dose 7 days second dose. accurate comparison would 7 days second dose 28 35 days 1st dose depending whether Moderna Pfizer. Moderna study one dose found peaked 92% efficacy around 35 42 days past 1 dose. CVS website: ""Do need show negative COVID-19 result travel, recreation leisure?.... Cost $139 per test.""

I quite understand wording CVS's website, """"Do need show negative COVID-19 result travel, recreation leisure?"". understand they're selling negative result $139 travel purposes. someone clarify this? Maybe places still free testing. can’t father get vaccine? 


There always nonzero risk. always order groceries dad delivered. lock door, strap N95 face, let live inside, alone forever, that’s something wish do. Also father preexisting conditions, active, good weight, may riskier activities/health issues worry about. 


Life short, it’s worth worrying every minute risk. end fate point, life know cease exist, hope make point knowing enjoyed experience. Feel free. mind long one pressuring same. think would courteous wear mask feeling sick, really mind sticking around since countries already cultural systems like work well, think something healthy person ever feels even slightly pressured outside absolute emergencies. they’re assuming you’ll negative. selling negative result tests smh.  Get battle cruiser Bunch adults acting like spoiled children. Fauci goddamn idiot want pick vaccine, don’t think Chile good data set looking at. you’re inferring. There’s data coming country terms vaccines like UK/Israel/US etc. 

All look fact Sinovac 50% effective symptomatic infection trials, Pfizer Moderna 90+% effective. Even comes severe illness, Pfizer close 100% effective, Sinovac best 80% effective. live vaccine basically half effective, get it. wait. don’t use Chile basis decision, reasons described. It’s good data set Got second Pfizer day 19 first Pfizer. Definitely kicked ass, day. 200% worthwhile. mean still... There's nothing regret unless happens... tiny tiny tiny chance. wondering, immunity based vaccines develop linearly exponentially? know? vaccine vaccine? Probably month soon, but...it point. Right? guarantee folks game today passed DFW airport daily months. There’s good chance would show antibodies. friend Covid last summer antibodies still showing test month ago. got second Pfizer. 102° fever, horrible achiness, terrible stomach ache, miserable headache. thing rough. 

I've also way arm soreness injection site, like said. almost week still sore. Cool lol Nothing patriotic doubting hard work american scientists. I’ve heard there’s real correlation two. exactly say everyone immunocompromised wore masks stuff.. favorite thing world least fourth population either gotten vaccinated got COVID recovered I'm going waste time worrying thousand+ miles away Many people knew would happen. Dude GLOBAL PANDEMIC. risks benefits different stuff normally circulation, way respond different well.

But paying attention pre-Covid, know ""Get protect everyone around you!"" long element promoting seasonal flu vaccine, conversations herd immunity always discussed protecting people medically can't vaccines. Getting vaccines protect others always, always, always part conversation. it’s issue problem

That’s you’re wrong. issue problem. people aren’t taking seriously continue spread it. spread friend. spreads friend. spreads father pass grocery store. father catches COVID dies. 

We responsible one another whether like not. people acting cavalier isn’t safe directly threatens health take seriously. 

The burden pandemic solely shoulders take seriously. It’s infuriating. Regardless much proof exists it’s still dangerous, like super spreader event biker convention South Dakota, one nominating new Supreme Court justice White House, even attending outdoor baseball game, people choosing ignorant pretend it’s seriously thing. 

That’s $0.02 people take offense. Kids don’t mature immune system couple years old fair. could hit small capillary. happens occasionally. self inject migraine meds happen last week. bled lot. medicine still it’s job. Got first dose Pfizer Saturday! Developed pretty gnarly headache hung around hour sore arm rest weekend, feel totally fine. 10/10, would recommend getting vaccinated. really, truly big deal they’re second 4 weeks later instead 3 weeks. I'm talking asymptomatic cases, ICU administrations, vaccine give 80%+ protection. 3 weeks ago 2.6million people 2 shots Chile (no data that, probably 65+ aged one received first dose 1 month earlier), almost percentage 60+ aged people got administered ICU vaccination.

Why important (and probably many others)? chance get chinese vaccine live it, wait pfizer/moderna months. weren’t hours ago? shit grandma never able get second appointment January nearly three damn months since hers. second tomorrow finally - hope works well :-( also keep mind strains cdc vs uk vs israel testing on. Israel 80% uk strain one big studys covid shall smite them.

Lol didn’t. husband kidney transplant never wore mask except first weeks released hospital covid. life 100% normal would never know immunocompromised didn’t tell you. don’t care lol. Even true (Which actually isn’t, they’ve stagnant) vaccine rollout full steam ahead. sure what's going NY. vaccine dashboard updated last checked covid case one 

Cuomo tweeted hours ago update may done COVID COVID isn’t done us yet. necessarily, husband kidney transplant lived normal life. works, kids school, coaches little league, involved church, traveled. aren’t home bound. still vaccinated doctors don’t know well even worm him. Legal showdown Florida deck. Lol me. like ""first time ever happy happy diabetes high A1C level"". got shot went back sad able eat carbs lol.  No, people bleed shots ,some don't.

My wife bled first second 


This normal shots covid Good! DC completely fucked vaccine rollout need get people region vaxxed. compelling evidence ""first doses first"" strategy works. Also, UK mostly B 1.1.7. according latest Phase 4 (March) data.

Which kind water bridge now, we're longer shortage vaccine situation - second doses slowing anyone getting first dose.  trial real-life data shows effect 4 month delay efficacy? think issue, I'd love see numbers. Depends long ago got it. risk brain thrombosis continues 16th day post vaccination Maybe parts, city around 35% population vaccinated least one dose, every Texas resident eligible first dose think we'll okay.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Pfizer data seems performing phenomenally. 

Moderna nearly identical Pfizer got EUA later Pfizer don’t amount public data it. Though given similarities would shocking see different results. 

Both need 2 doses 3-4 weeks apart. 

J&amp;J less effective complete prevention. also needs 1 shot. 

All 3 prevent fatal doses severe hospitalizations. lucky position getting pick choose. can’t really go wrong. Wow. Thanks trial. long 2nd 3rd doses, feeling now? going take forever. I’m actually pretty annoyed Michigan. know many people got covid week friend waiting result he’s positive covid. got vaxed week ago. Sure, effectiveness measured. still represents percentage chance vaccine work specific individual. think unreasonable unfaithful make example 1 5 1 10 people room immune Covid. take enough 'rooms', theoretically average would work out. Due open exterior structure it’s ventilated ballpark I’ve to. still insane decision. Well shit? Good ventilation vital airborne virus. Virus . go act normal Right you.. second sat.. congrats! way around. First dose kicked ass second dose barely even got sore arm. Interesting. Good data. guess terms wave surge timeline still similar. California Arizona wave surge decline seems similar. Thoughts? Seriously trying political looking data trying find patterns reality countries go Sinovac 3 countries pretty much hogging vaccines. USA taking pfizer/moderna. UK taking Astrazeneca. Russia Sputnik. China using Sinaphram/Sinovac. 

&amp;nbsp;

Everyone else getting small quantities. country deals Astrazeneca Pfizer neither come through. ended another deal Sinovac Astrazeneca Pfizer finally sent here. Again, UK taking astrazeneca vaccines. US taking pfizer/moderna ones. 

&amp;nbsp;

Once they're finished, they'll allow trickle go countries. yeah, much people wanted sinovac like get since pfizer/moderna/astrazeneca allocating towards 3 4 places. friends got vaccinated J&amp;J today. Two chills, one's passed cold, feel anything. Starting think poked needle forgot vaccine. That's probably true see CDC guidelines it... guidelines based done cheap, done right. actually huge news many people. 4,000,000 vaccines delivered underserved (and affected) communities fantastic see! indeed zero. trial participant died vaccines far. Infection, sure, death severe hospitalisation 2 doses. certain states, many not. Also isn’t exponential shocking push Florida sea already? 0 chances hospitalisation. 18% chance infection 2 weeks chance death. Also numbers improve gap doses. UK currently 12 weeks 8-12 weeks recommended. serious? closed essential travel directions, almost year. still can't turn away someone Canadian citizen shows border entering country. WWE trash company happily exchange human lives profit. exception. 

To think, thought making right moves Thunderdome oh well, whenever get optimistic almost anything, get proven wrong anyway. Roughly equivalent one person killed attendance fully sold Wembley Stadium event, put perspective. Christ giving headache back forth whether kids spread not. It’s year. Duh? Yes, come outside China, matter are, mandatory quarantined government appointed facility 14 days, ifs buts.

Then complete quarantine, self isolate another 7 days residence. China actually monitor since health code would ""red"", ""red"", basically can't go anywhere except maybe take walk around house. seems summit everest LAST place catch cobid  I'm glad novavax well moderna ready test vaccine specificity south african discovered variant! Doesn’t surprise actually. pandemic, something look forward (society reopening). brain fooled thinking things better ends. didn’t feel first dose. totally depends good vaccinator definitely felt second totally wound rammed arm. I'll bet amount money want 7 day death average US get third peak pandemic point 2021. three different testing sites giving different vaccines. 

I’m going tomorrow (none require appointment) I’m wondering vaccine safest three?

Yes, know they’re safe, one better? statistically strict meaning asked. time exposed cloud SARS viruses, roll dice odds becoming infected roll. likely get infected 10th exposure first exposure **However**, asking cumulative risk. asking chances escaping infection one time, asking chances escaping infection *10 times row*. 

To make math easy, lets say exposed SARS, there's 10% chance catching COVID. 10% risk first exposure 101st exposure. cumulative risk, though, risk catching one exposure, likely win health lottery 10, 100, 1000 times *in row*. One exposure risk 10%. Two exposures risk *19%*. ***10 exposures risk 65%***. why, even vaccines, important keep wearing mask, limiting exposure indoor spaces, socially distancing *so long rate infected people wild relatively high*. higher rate infection area, times risk/protection attacked, times roll dice, cumulative risk increases. job limit number times get attacked that, occasions get attacked protection vaccine keeps getting sick. batter really good protection enough exposures, eventually number going come up. logic mean retail workers got treated even worse? grocery store worker Walmart employee never got work home, essential making sure country able get food supplies. mandatory religious duty many many Muslims never able do.  around 5 million year attending 1.5 billion Muslims, 

Yikes!! Reminds certain denominations preach rapture supposed exact number going saved - nearly many even themselves. made wall assumption along kids fact human fact spread disease like human, mention drag every damn crud home school outside pandemic, maybe could funding way early schools revamped properly kids (and teachers staff) could back school safely.

But instead dicked around ""studies"" best prove maybe kinda sorta could possibly kids might transmit smidge less COVID everyone else they're ""safe"". demand schools open jack shit it.

It's dumb. don’t think enough evidence seasonality all. look graphs we’ve numerous waves throughout year seemingly unrelated weather. also got infected symptoms initial infection fatigue loss smell. Also AZ symptoms beyond sore shoulder. infected guarantee shot cause horrible side effects. Leave unvaccinated mercy COVID say. Tired lunacy. Thank confirming numbers cited online poll massively distorted actual ones lol obviously good reasons try get superstitious people agree science based policy, given recent history white evangelicals, ""Love neighbor"" one would seem resonate them. feel well. got J&amp;J last Thursday really put mind ease. I’m course still masking feels like giant weight lifted. It’s honestly surprising things going Europe right now. Time full cover 2 weeks second dose (or more)? Meanwhile family refuse get I'll keep mine secret. kind family got mad wearing face mask church. Oh boy, think wore femboy skirt acted 🙄 Mi pretty strict lock down, think lifted gave everyone false sense safety. number “2” fact higher “1” Let's go Bluejays also skim/read 100+ comments found one saying kids hospitalized COVID. So.. unless missed something, think you’re jumping conclusions way you’re interpreting people’s concerns. Ah, thank makes sense. misunderstood (one route) (all US routes). Mine Florida. TL;DR continue doses. two shots spaced 3-4 weeks apart considered one dose each. Might well! husband shellfish allergy got shot like normal. Estimates one 100k vaccine.

Driving car 1 year 1 500k

Factor also age groups.

Look still slim odds necessarily, example P1 variant driving sharp increase Canada, particularly BC. still need hit targets yeah, variants might overcome seasonal aspect they’re much transmissible. Ok. see saying. I’ve paying close attention. could sworn saw commenting European data, probably mistaken. I’ve read like 100 articles kerfuffle blur frankly. Rednecks Looks like Sincvac producing extremely inconsistent results. “that kind crowd”? want Saudi ask waving patents? went tangent.

No, I'm saying biggest problem distribution that's looking freebies 

Disgusting attitude towards human life. barring that, explain moral hazard company used public funds develop vaccine make profit it?  capes! know much NJ, difficult rollout vaccine vs places? Masks social distancing *are* continuing. People even allowed mix indoors socially another 5 weeks. time everyone significant risk death time immunity vaccine kick in. would third wave hit UK Europe one? new variant us much infectious deadly. much higher levels immunity EU. talk keep people adhering rules time being. argument flew back pre-vaccine. another month relevant all. us remain US vaccinating 5x country right now, track share vaccines countries also. since January, catch drift. One reason New Zealand successful fight COVID-19: rigorously enforcing lockdown rules. 85 people jailed breaking rules. Although video mention might mean MSD (Merck USA Canada). working vaccine French partners proved ineffective.

 US MSD/Merck helping Janssen/J&amp;J shot result vaccine working out. 

Sanofi vaccine phase 3 trials know fits saying, mentioned video. UK regulators previously said elevated risk therefore nothing worry it?

Based evidence. made claim evidence Norway Germany definitely rubbishing it. Hence, false. backwards actually Got J&amp;J last Thursday couldn’t happy. I’ve done part mask final big step. Hopefully others continue well. hurt both. course mask important. respond particular comments argument data sources, me? I’ve literally never said kids hospitalized high rates. kids teachers, parents, grandparents MAY likely hospitalized due KIDS spreading COVID. 

Not everyone high risk fully vaccinated. state opened vaccines folks one comorbidity today. Well, That’s one way things improve. record Sinovac Sputnik effective others variants. Please explain, risk reward? Thinking risky get given youth/health? really prove 1-dose strategy effective?

For example Netherlands, vaccinated around 11.4% population (first dose, following regular 2-dose strategy).

Deaths fell 84% still dropping since last peak (January 11th). vaccination campaign started 6th January.

While cases dropped 36% since last peak (December 22nd). Keep mind cases decreased 71% peak mid February, increased again, peaked level 34% lower last peak days ago.

So around effect (split deaths cases) Netherlands slightly milder still similar lockdown. Also, mostly UK variant one vaccinated lot not. effect see probably almost lockdown effect slight vaccination effect. phase 1/2 results showed single dose elicited sufficient antibody well T-cell (CD4 CD8) responses. Given many logistical advantages requiring one dose, went first phase 3 trial (only requiring one dose advantage competing vaccines). phase 3 trial two-dose regime currently underway well.

See report Trash article. shots arms better. actually take 75-79 group lol Arizona’s cases per million 116,080
California’s cases per million 93,206

Arizona’s death per million 2,334
California’s death per million 1,513

Arizona 7th worst state total cases, California 33rd. Guess Canada going start rejecting ID cards passports since forged well. commonly heard would likely worst wave yet. realize friends live representative Dallas, let alone Texas whole, according friends live Highland Park, masks still use least around Highland Park. 

They said visiting friends Rowlett found mask wearing less prevalent, still occurring enough numbers noticeable. 

So, guess case said depends are. Yes 3 would work better 2 50 would work better 49. problem is, costs scale linearly number doses efficacy goes 100. Getting everyone 0 2 doses give 95% protection mild disease. cost same, improve protection 5%. parents getting vaxxed. go case there's extras? That’s lot anger directed someone proven correct  time seasonal mid April showers. Remember originally wanted open schools said children weren’t spreaders? saw SNL video (*Boomers Got Vax*) make joke J&amp;J vaccine less desirable one take.

Timestamped link: false?

* interesting?
* UK regulators previously said elevated risk therefore nothing worry it?

I'm making value judgement way. American I'm watching sidelines. story true, would seem like bit face I've previously heard coming regulators UK exactly. uses term offended try put anyone disagrees. Disingenuous good way put it. want Saudi ask waving patents? went tangent.

Going tangent myself, novel thought, completely waving question, that's looking freebies none work. 

Licensing sure, everyone guarantee things like QA, price etc. India, China, South Korea west producing vaccines. countries pass requirements produce too. There's much protection 10 days post-vaccination, cases may continue rise another two three weeks. mean individuals population? guarantee majority kind crowd UNvaccinated. proud that.  Probably pedantic question: ""social distancing"" also engaging social activity leaving house (which definitely better mask good ventilation)? Well, optimism aside, unvaccinated countries eventually lead variants travel planes seed cities again. There's already scary mutations Brazil India. might want get ventilation system safe. fair, Los Angeles, CA ground zero, world, weeks. doubt Arizona ever become ground zero. yet find answer better ""we test one dose""

That answer. Also J&amp;J test two doses.

In earliest trials, manufacturers designed test protocols give best chance positive result quickly possible. interested optimising anything; wanted get products market ASAP needed ""good enough"". Pfizer, Moderna AZ went two doses judgement 2 doses likely show positive result 1 dose, went 3 week interval minimum thought would effective. There's lots real world evidence vaccines 8-12 weeks likely effective, wanted complete trials ASAP want wait 8-12 weeks.

(That's also Pfizer went -80°C ultra cold chain; confident would work, enough customers willing use conditions. AZ came onto market less restrictive handling requirements Pfizer looked relaxing requirements; need to.)

Then J&amp;J started trials, saw opportunity get one competitors offering single dose vaccine. trialled single dose. highly likely two doses would effective, give competitive advantage, whereas one dose would.

These pharmaceutical companies engaged process trying end pandemic efficiently possible. trying sell many vaccines possible. Never forget that. Toronto thing care Hines like entire year places? took 3 years highschool replace AC rate wear goggles tanning bulbs everywhere lol field effectiveness data countries use SinoVac (Chile, Turkey, Indonesia, etc.)? still base assumptions Brazil trial published results (just numbers couple press releases)? country, exact opposite... Hip-hip hooray. Oh, wait! Source? here's one shows decreased efficacy P.1, enough render useless stretch. matter fact study specifically says mutants neutralized lost 40 percent efficacy, hasn't, would still enough stop massive wave. Chill. new information.....
Variants make effectiveness go down, still highly effective variants... plus vaccine makers already testing vaccines counteract variants even better.. easy make bulk. problem present ones can't afford $20 whatever, 10bn shots. not? company doesn’t mind, gives shit? meetings Teams even pandemic working office. office work Teams meetings day could home? idea math works situation specifically, I've never quite understood people problem conceptual level. Money exist vacuum, sole purpose transactional. really working job money - working lifestyle gives you. opinion, that's actually be; two people job buying power. X money San Francisco massively different amount buying power X money Kansas. see problem trying account wages. mostly people fucking lazy need ""full immunity"". difference 0% immunity 50%+ immunity massive. 2 weeks first shot vaccine pretty much good go. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yea shouldve kept Biontech   I'm intrigued hear reasons post downvoted. ain't cheif surprise generally speaking. People like working home, many people prefer working office. much changed regard, maybe people tried realized liked it.

I am, however, surprised much article focuses peoples' mental hangups this. I'm really sure make it. article people anxious return professionally social situations all, and/or feeling comfortable setting now, and/or ""worried health"" (just get vaccine...?).

This bit shocking me, pretty introverted person puts lot effort high premium health. share concerns all. really get problem is. totally get wanting go back working home nice. feel way too. rest this... just, what? Masks help, lockdowns proven futile cuz nobody follows them. Countries higher compliance able get lockdowns work people follow them. issue enforcement, near impossible enforce laws essentially plea public. Despite people may say plenty anti maskers liberal states laws work. Something like 1 3 people LA infected. Americans like told matter reason measures work. Honestly far pandemic feel businesses, people going invalidate precautions anyway might well least protect economy open limited rules. Flat earthers? I’m sure keep going circles point I’m trying make. 

There better solution attempts ONE centralized solution. solution generalizes truisms (like kids better person) inevitably lead inequitable outcomes.

The way better creating solutionS take consideration individual community needs families, students, teachers. Solutions collaborative, flexible, evolving new issues arise. Solutions co-created versus delivered top-down. 

If choose solution fails meet either students’, teachers’, families’ needs you’re going leave people feeling unsafe someone going end harmed. Teachers quit burnout (not helpful). Parents feel attacked withdraw farther, push convenient suggestion may harm others. Socially anxious bullied students end shutting again. 

As former administrator, personally feel families telling (or showing) can’t get kids school, child doesn’t want show school, feel safer home, responsibility administrator work together find alternatives. teachers telling don’t feel safe, responsibility brainstorm together ways feel safer. 

Had started process last year, could found solutions worked communities. Holding community conversations (not board meetings clear power dynamics preventing productive conversation) would good start. would reached community businesses leaders try bring problem solving. likely solution would different community. 

Can without everyone forced back campus? Absolutely! Tech amazing. tech, email, text, personal phone calls (not asking/questioning/or demanding) also work wonders. families may require time patience, require us go way, much like they’ve gone theirs. think eventually school could get everyone. family doesn’t least one safe person campus, family child already risk pre-covid.

Will people need safe space outside house learn? Absolutely.

Will them? No, shouldn’t forced back.

Will fall cracks.? Yes. Truancy disengagement national issue preCovid isn’t going get solved overnight. added face time kids. Maybe we’ll get back preCovid levels, even dismal best.

While response diplomatic, appreciated thought, made attempt adjust thinking incorporate experience possible solutions. seemed intention post first place. provided compassion, plowed ahead despite someone yelling WAIT, me. solution harms child.

This kind problem solving tends isolate parents feel left fend themselves. longer trust us/schools keep safe support them. It’s families don’t open doors us.

Can think ways incorporate concerns solution? 

Some schools already providing families options. know schools allowing families choose whether child comes stays home learns virtually. Teachers don’t feel safe, continue teaching virtually. Families teachers feel safe, go small-group, self-contained pods. 

The school ran focused building good relationships families. starting family services department, developed workshops around parent needs, open door policy, approached problems team one person center problem responsible solution. Parents frequently sat offices sharing openly. 

If school doesn’t kind relationship, there’s quick fix.

Where start?

It require move away punitive practices destroyed relationships families (families won’t let time ever contact there’s problem need fix, sending truancy letters, social workers). Create onsite resources give every family safe person calls check-in complain.

It require centering students emotional personal experiences academic. generally deficit model emphasizes academic weaknesses diminishes strengths. also prioritizes academic achievement emotional well-being. leads anxiety, feels insecurity, resentment children. Creating meaningful learning opportunities student-led projects help children move past heavy emotions balancing academic skills.

It require taking pressure teachers parent children hit rigorous academic standards time being. require us shifting away micromanaging patronizing staff trusting honest limits resourced, best.

Most importantly, take serious acceptance things aren’t way normally may need make large scale adjustments curriculum across grades order avoid burning staff students attempt close gap due fear future failure...which inevitably result failure 30% kids already struggling keep previous pace.

You asked find better solution point ONE solution going better. trying find one isn’t tailored specifics needs community, inevitably struggle successful. you’re genuinely curious generate better solutions, I’d recommend following resources:

Schools Learn, Closing Opportunity Gap, Learning Liberate, Design-Based school improvement give excellent ideas generate community solutions. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Really curious it’ll like, also don’t know suspect covid last April. need tons kinda science. efficient combating disease. Same. think thought every single day good six months. nibern paying close attention.... blur... feel need badmouth MHRA basis something thought read, actually read. Riiiiiiiiight. Kind like watching roman gladiator fight except man fighting virus instead beast another man. part members audience die instead contestants. That’s tax brackets work. 

If get raise get moved higher tax bracket, it’s mathematically impossible make less money come behind raise (assuming weren’t assistance programs like food stamps, etc.)

The true reverse, taking pay cut still taking pay cut even move bracket. You’re making less money.  Interesting would this, none vaccines approved FDA guaranteed prevent transmission infection. clinical trials tests til 2023. don’t think know enough efficacy medicine make requirement. Lol far past point eradicated. 

The vaccination halt tracks completely like polo vaccination. like flu-get shot year expected popular strain. Yeah wonder NY's going!

That said, TX vaccination's administered grew much faster rate MA. take look vaccine charts 91divoc, kind steadily increasing total vaccines administered, TX vaccine administered chart kind sky rockets past weeks. vaccines going older ages vulnerable populations, would make sense hospitalization declining there.  
And I'm sure comment yours, Texas cases ""very high rising"" IMO case count averages lowest they've since last June, maybe last September.  
I think masking distancing help overall magnitude case spikes, taking shot dark think less attention paid type strains currently circulating populations. also think seasonality could factor, saw big spikes early pandemic still inside getting cold, TX first big spike happen June, residents spending way time outside, I'd assume A/C savior living south hot southern summers full swing.

J&amp;J measured efficacy differently Pfizer/Moderna cant really say less effective others. Kids take 2 doses measles vaccine one dose 93% effective 2 doses 97% remember correctly Arizona’s wave came last summer.

Edit. They’ve two major waves, one summer, one winter.  real question whether better give one person whole cookie two people half cookie each. That's easy answer. according Fauci. variants dangerous entering fourth wave catastrophic. Anyone thinks restrictions lifted next months severely mistaken. It’s gonna shut it’s gonna stay way covid variants eradicated. probably still cellular l immunity; that’s part lasts antibodies fade. tested it’s much expensive test. sounds common tbh. good :) Sweden less deaths per capita many European countries though.

One potential cause mild case(possibly asymptomatic) Covid early left protein spikes body.

The first shot allows body make antibodies, may trigger immune response. second shot creates response body attacks protein, along protein spikes left body. Autoimmune response essentially.

If heart protein spikes, body would try rid newly identified invader potentially causing wide variety symptoms depending virus left spikes.

Getting something simple cold change things, stress (for some) getting vaccinated symptoms afterwards also changing things surprise all. Best case scenario everyone goes back office flexibility. Worst case management realizing jobs outsourced. objectively false based current research. reaction may seemed little harsh, get they’re coming from. “not wanting” get isn’t good enough reason to. 

Herd immunity protects everyone, including people may medically able vaccinated. enough people choose get vaccinated, never reach level protection. 

It also allows virus continue spread mutate - something affects us - something -*again*- must develop vaccine booster for. never end everyone doesn’t get board. 

And that’s sound appealing stick people can’t bothered don’t believe vaccines island together somewhere let deal viruses old fashioned pre-vaccination way.

It’s frustrating anti-vaxers go life enjoying herd immunity provided everyone else nothing sustain it. Hell I'd take three let me. equally important takeaway unless it’s short duration, social distancing meaningless without adequate ventilation.

With airborne disease, don’t even need room time transmission happen. 

Super frustrating we’ve information year still “new studies show” stage trying get people recognize this. going line pockets HVAC people useful months. largely still puts tech requirement people, everyone tech savvy enough use app implemented, youre gonna get lot people vaccinated dont phone particular app ready go phone. im also skeptical logistically feasible determine accuracy someone got vaccinated already since like require show ssn  FL maintains immunization records. schools large playground areas various concrete courts fall could easily use wedding type tents classes. started current job pandemic never local office Seattle. coworkers work every day NY, Atlanta, San Francisco. don’t even know anyone Seattle office, it’s going super weird want go there.

Side effects: still find worrying getting covid fully forgetting fully vaccinated month People seemed think scientists/governments supposed magically get everything right novel virus. Good see someone respected come say this.

IMHO seems even lot folks understand going along variant hype. guess that, faced tragic situation, get behind anything might convince public take precautions. Anything get death toll down, especially direct witness it. First news makes look forward getting vaccinated! telling lot flawed human nature many people assume would fictional character (based real historical person, still fictional) book base life-or-death decisions material world (that far prove, one that's real).  got curious tried look seeing conflicting reports, lot unknowns. think good term Google “Covid vaccine 12 weeks apart evidence,” something similar. 

But finding vaccine evidence backed [a Oxford/AstraZeneca one. one showed still like 76% effective 12 weeks later, delaying second shot seemed actually help work better!

It’s certainly higher reported. may ask people get retested get registered system. What's good already infected antibodies would qualify well.

This still feels like better strategy.  also mandate exercise &amp; dieting fat people risk lifestyle choices stop putting strain medical system it.

Those people poor choices put others risk taxing health care system vulnerable choice need resources.

Fat people danger everyone! Boil em, mash em, stick em arm! dumb what?  Four months results; pretty sore arm day side-effects first jab. Anytime anyone symptoms tested returning. kids tested twice year. Always negative. 

Strange still seem get colds. none us ever test positive. Masks don’t stop common cold? Idk. It’s frustrating. Working home became fairly common industry around 2011-12, GREAT. went (installing new HW, cabling, etc) everyone became ten times efficient. Around 2014-15 management began looking reason beyond hated employees couldn’t micro managed like before. went away everyone became miserable again.

WFH last year fantastic we’d stupid abandon again. traffic benefits alone make worth it. also say sky blue grass green?

Yeah shit

Why news much   want some. moved job 1700 miles, even met coworkers, communicated fine half year! people person, want meet badly! ... think I'll work better ... same, personal connection. 

My boss job open telling us discuss discomforts forced work person time being. Surely time come longer true, safe. luxury benefit, wish everyone opportunity. I'm really sure people surprised this. office dwelling friends have, majority *not* want go back office. least, want flexible time work home gotten quite used it.

they're WAY productive getting job done *their* time instead shoehorned M-F 9-6 management. shows work! commute, worrying company dress code, way way less eating lunch, etc. also commute! worrying rapidly rising gas prices again. 

I think biggest group that's freaking management. experience it’s definitely crock shit. good mask compliance part Texas. course won’t, exists every state. People take political theater extrapolate population. increased social contact 

Funny mention this, wife works hospital saying one co-workers rushed see mom right getting vaccine *face palm*. (And yes, wife told like 3 times takes time build immunity.) 1.Chile use Pfizer Sinovac

2.The data support hospitalization younger unvaccinated age group

3.Similar increase infection reported US EU countries recently.

4.Until herd immunity reached, relaxing physical distancing measure bad idea It’s still huge endorsement, that’s big thing.

Imagine churches said would require vaccinations. Would help end pandemic lot quicker. obviously directly correlated restrictions lack thereof.

Directly correlated mean factor important. 

Anything puts people closer contact going increase spread. argue understand virus spreads first place. mean ton factors. Texas almost 3 million confirmed cases usual assumptions confirmed vs total apply, meaning vaccinations recoveries solid chunk population antibodies. That's going bigger factor whether 30% 50% people go office now. relief chance fully vaccinated vs. partially vaccinated next 3 weeks.

I bet farm study vs. norm. antibody testing perhaps. antibodies unless immune system messed immunity. think conflating lot different advice gave. One worry improperly trained people might touch face mask lot make worse, didn’t data best proceed. wasn’t non risk, didn’t end big issue see gene therapy going around lot lately It’s beautiful Texas past 3 weeks people spending time outside it’s windy people stay distant. Seasonality definitely helped.

I’m going agree restrictions, them, people still wearing masks certainly lax states.

We 29% vaccinated right though. Texas great vaccination distribution game ones likely present symptoms vaccinated first since followed variation CDC guidelines promoted 65+.

It’s quite possible plenty COVID still coursing population showing symptoms would still keep people getting tested (and testing positive) hospitalized (since low risk populations).

Just couple thoughts. Good luck lmao experts disagree though destruction societal norms binds kept us alive going species time

Correct, lockdowns that.

Can't go visit people hospital dying, can't go funerals, can't attend weddings, can't hug, can't talk without face coverings, can't gather.

Ya, right. Thanks! I'll take spot. got first shot Cuba va wish more. list 10 Evangelical leaders top head. Unfortunately 1 made positive statement them; far many busy spreading conspiracy theories saying anything even though churches open Max capacity. frankly infuriates me. Eligibility keeps expanding supply same. harder ever get appointment. Accelerate testing. believe kids tested rate adults. Ask school nurse often kids sent school sick. UK delayed second dose DESPITE experts pointing evidence safe

That gamble happened pay off, done without support experts hope would work

That said, appear 1 dose sufficient months, 2 needed long term. Eg UK it, basically shortens vaccine rollout time 3 months country, big difference.

I'm British first dose early January, second dose week ago want get college students vaccinated en masse, offer free pizza.  Florida resident 16 17 year olds? eligible Pfizer vaccine. going wait children vaccine available, probably time next year? that’s pretty BS. That’s alienating large group people would seriously help vaccination numbers. Bingo! happening right now??? probably apply vaccines meant ones foolishly believe severity virus need vaccine. might get anyway things reach. nothing young healthy Sadly often case United States well. *terrible* nursing homes. Also doctor, drinking alcohol weakens immune system hard say exactly would happen, possible might make difficult body clear virus (and maybe make feel extra crappy go hard). know body best maybe drink discretion. Happy early birthday! Yeah shit getting second anyway, “ Great hear“? 188 children died 19-20 flu season. mid February, 270 died covid. considering long covid. Told employer I’d looking another job forced commute regularly again. could take 10k less year still come ahead, 70 mile one-way commute. hope dont mind asking flu like side effects vaccine feel much anything ? Sinovac reported 67% efficacy Indonesia 83% turkey. countries efficacy moderate severe case 100% frequent testing? That's really true. way efficacy measured identical across manufacturers, difference test population circulating strains time testing. J&amp;J trialed rougher period, outstanding efficacy mRNA vaccines showing variants strong evidence they're better. deploying tests mice find running around? No. amount economic damage


Source? quality life?  residents vaccinated would put “blacklist” barred taking public transport entering local markets

Is also great way showing much national duty is. get jab, can't buy food. Lol spike Perhaps have, really mean much. vaccinated, [don't need even around someone - unless showing symptoms.

so makes sense people vaccinated, lower testing rate going be. Fucking amen. Well comment reposnse 4+ studies showed one shot actually gets 80-85% effectiveness two weeks it’s admisitered. second shot bumps 90-95%. allowed go home. This. I've seen lot ""...as long as..."" type conditions qualifying statements reopening initiatives, especially schools. people forget need meet conditions get benefits them.

""We need entirely new ventilation systems, still installed year knowing need them"" somehow gets rounded to, ""We need social distancing anymore!"" umm DUH. family member send kid school sit class 30 different kids 30 different households....what expect............morons Well, *this* millennial getting tomorrow This, neighbour one invited 12-14 year old meeting. spouted 144,000 ""places heaven"" clarified since Jesus etc. 8million ""them"" enough spaces say 1% living since probably already taken. 

My young mind thought worth gamble may well fun life since I'm probably going burn anyway. 

How earth people stay faithful religion likely outcome hell. genuinely believe better 99%... MLM I’m talking public schools. Interesting, thanks explanation! CDC health officials terrible talking public. Whenever official statement ""No evidence X"" comes out, roll eyes horrible public messaging. People interpret ""No evidence X"" ""X false"" ""We enough information confirm whether X true false"". happened masks, happened safety vaccine, happened vaccine preventing spread virus. make people think taking action pointless doctors know speak general public cause public mistrust say X fact true. especially transmissible children. never saw experts say forgo second shot entirely though, saying delay like UK would better shortage shots. 
Nobody fine cops shooting black people street cold blood. 10,000,000 arrests happen every year, 30 unarmed whites 20 unarmed blacks killed police -- so, exceedingly rare events (even would great minimize cases much possible). Since blacks commit crime (e.g. three five times higher rates homicide) frequently subject arrest. per-interaction basis, unarmed whites likely (if likely) killed police unarmed blacks. since regular media social media publicize black cases, Americans distorted impression strong racial bias, distorted impression overall number. public law keen prosecute unjustified killings police regardless victim. 

The general pattern America years become less less racist. Yet paradoxically, racism decreases, hysteria focus race becomes exaggerated. Income class better predictor social differences, country obsessed looking racial lens. US headed become another Lebanon nothing accomplished everyone tribal nation whole suffers self-hatred. part future belongs Asia. wtffffffffff let people outside man!!! say without wreaking r/atheism, many ""progressive"" types wont take vaccine much religious people take it. true. much more.

Michael Osterholm: proponent returning classroom. more. B.1.1.7 changes equation. no, sold houses Bay Area moved Sacramento. :/ Sinovac similar efficacy AZ JnJ vaccine, fact better since Sinovac least reported side effects compared AZ JnJ, especially AZ blotclot distaster expect hybrid scheduling, although anecdotally wife it’s already pretty common. I’ve never worked home. *very* good authority Mike Osterholm waiting serious pandemic entire career 😆 One mask? Better make two. One shot vaccine? Nope two. social distancing masks? Nope still wear them. IN: New variant COVID found UK tested, South African DOH follow recovered dead. numbers fairly accurate, affected two occasions (of aware) provinces reported backlog cases prior months. changed overall pattern date.

Antibody tests 4,000 blood donors reported suffered COVID revealed significant proportion carried antibodies B1.135. Few, antibodies, could linked original strain. tests carried severely affected provinces country. Whilst perfect indication rate asymptomatic infection, certainly confirmed ability B1.135 spread rapidly asymptomatically amongst relatively young population. South Africa median age 28. B1.135 inevitably affected older individuals severely, noticeable amount symptomatic reinfections, clearly scientifically analyzed virtue significant proportion reinfections SA leg Novavax trial, vaccination notwithstanding.

We simply going test everybody resources richer countries. test presentation demand. there, ensure patient receives follow analysis. Demand, present, extremely low comparison height second wave. 

For context, report movement within number active cases daily basis. also report recoveries deaths. provide far detailed public data many countries within EU, maintain massive active case counts (too large realistic) little indication number recoveries, forcing use hospitalisation rates indicate whether COVID declining, bit odd metric positive cases hospitalized. NICD SA even breaks down, countrywide per province, number patients hospital, number ventilated ICU general population. hospitalisation rate Ireland, people currently require hospitalisation. curve insofar death concerned flattened truly pray stays way. NICD data freely available website provides great deal data. 

South Africa also records excess deaths fairly accurately, it’s dangerous automatically assume due COVID one leading causes death TB multi-drug resistant TB. already accounts 80,000+ deaths per annum SA (on average) one-third TB tests carried comparison pre-pandemic numbers, suggests may approximately 50,000+ excess deaths due TB, exacerbated strain COVID placed public health resources treatment facilities. 

I position comment excess deaths linked HIV/AIDS malaria, would fewer comparison TB, I’d say excess deaths due COVID may well 70,000 slightly end second wave. scientist - I’m relaying information I’ve picked various sources trying apply figures already published. know certain organisations use entire excess death count one cannot sure true cause may help present absolute worst case scenario formulating pandemic response. 

Bear mind South African scientists probably know much behaviour danger B1.135 well E484K mutation. wasted little time highlighting concern behaviour SA mirrored predictions, key factor regarding whether lift implement certain restrictions. wasted time sharing available data rest world highlighting variant concern. also carry genomic sequencing multiple African states responsible reporting Tanzanian variant weeks ago. 

They overtook US sheer number samples sequenced despite starting months later, one comparatively small team work, responsible additional African states neither human capital financial resources first world countries. 

There little reason doubt South Africa reports accurate, limited number resources available health services. However, private public healthcare services provide COVID testing, avoid limited lack public resources public/private joint effort. situation countries regarding potential rate asymptomatic spread, trend decrease active cases reflected relative freedom allowed whilst cases continued drop last months. 

Hopefully avoid third wave - determined numbers week onwards. 

Not African countries lumped single group. able release accurate reports, others try make best every resource disposal. course, nothing ever done perfectly, assure developing countries badly affected pandemic (primarily variant nobody ordered) never stopped fighting, taken pride transparency, least one saw importance continued genome sequencing countries fell wayside initial race determine genetic make-up original strain.

Even earned travel ban 121 countries, already variant question. It’s called Defense Act. drug allergy (bacterium) let know. stay 30 minutes instead normal 15. ended getting head rush, dizzy, hot flash 5 minutes shot (moderna). lasted 30 seconds good go since. Right. Unless cause death meaningless. neighbor, 75 years old, said felt hammered day after, gone 24 hours. one else know anything typical vaccine local reaction site injection. 

Plus, vaccine keeps dying, significantly lessens severity COVID survivors, including reducing hospitalization rate. 

My son healthy 34-year-old teacher Georgia, never mask requirement students. course got it, course survived, said one helluva ride. Now, three months later, persistent cough go back doctor week. 

I think it’s mistake think COVID point survival. Even live, it’s possible lasting effect body, probably negative effect bank account.

On hand, vaccine free. happens us received 1 shot series, can't get 2nd shot due immediate allergic reaction? keep city salaries. think awakening rude. show American legislation banning exports vaccines us? 

Hint. doesn’t exist. producing doses AZ addition expecting receive Europe.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm little older got astrazeneca vaccine 16 days ago far okay. think okay worried little bit let become overbearing. chances getting serious side effect low cause harm body significant worrying instead. Besides, much since body already! mixing pharmaceutical companies country. UK blocking AstraZeneca sending them. Maybe whole upset pharmaceutical giants. Pretty sure Novavax also delaying vaccine EU. Also bet wrong horses. AstraZeneca originally meant main vaccine EU, orders Pfizer/Biontech originally relatively low. still goto venues without vaccination, need proof negative test result. Vaccines don’t give rights make testing unnecessary. Sweden lockdown vaccination campaign successful, death rate declined rapidly, too. agree you, mean one solution all. That's literally additive means... independent events cannot add probabilities together like first poster suggesting. probabilities come similar low numbers events (in hundreds) they're quite same. Less L. Ron Hubbard. too! hate actually preferring office twisted “you friends life besides coworkers.” Ummm that’s true. didn’t socialize coworkers outside work even remote. think it’s OK don’t like able use Slack reach someone wait hours response. People said Florida rising again. states ahead behind others far waves b.1.1.7 dominance. storm might also slowed transmission quite lot Texas. Hopefully keep vaccination rates avoid wave.  gaps sides mesh masks people relying droplet narrative explain masks work simultaneously engaging “nobody wearing masks CORRECTLY” explain people getting sick regardless. it’s aerosol mask nothing. Yeah, I'm betting anonymous source got confused (or trying create political pressure EU misleading media) Reuters went super sensationalized headline double-checking sources. really make sense AZ would 3.1million doses ready Q1 ship Europe Australia. NY, people make appointments using name show photo ID personalized ticket enter vax venue.

Nope. Maryland first last name date birth checked ID. one looked paperwork wife. Almost easy voting (no date birth voting). serious question: Serbia 2019. want visit country gf. chance get vaccinated without quarantine? type vaccine okay us. feel like media exaggerated whole France EU put eggs Sanofi basket getting screw. US UK order way per capita EU. agree control happen Sanofi switch vaccine production early. probably lower 2018. want well. coworkers best friends outside work, great work culture pandemic. Good in-person collaboration support. small lunch group coworkers occasionally went eat. company leadership listens employees put great events always voluntary people enjoyed them. don’t feel part team productive Slack Microsoft Teams. wouldn’t mind half week home half office.

I predict companies sort hybrid plan number stay remote forever smaller. also imagine might see lot people laid fired refusing return unless health reason need full WFH. So, lack data recommended something barely tested? Deaths lag cases least 4 weeks. We’re talking 8-10 weeks deaths peak. controversial, best way ensure no/minimal vaccine passports? Get vaccine fence anyone else unsure well.

While passports may done stated intention help prevent outbreak, biggest reason ensure virus stomped large swaths people refuse get it. people get vaccinated, less likely passports needed fewer places find them.

My guess used carrot/stick get fence-sitters get jabbed. people willingly point, less likely passports implemented. Find public school building country actually well functioning ventilation system, specifically urban areas students, less funding less space, I'll believe valuable information. in: sometimes people die Thank goodness. get paid drop common sense day long. call Lean Agile Management 3.0 whatever—and get twisted pretzel hurt too. meant. meant companies could say something along lines 'your job fully remote, live anywhere get paid salary makes live confortably rural Kansas'. control lasts longers. Rates shoot vaccines though.

Why require proof ""just cover butts""?

Seems like low bar breaking glass sharing health information business owners customer.

I'm avidly anti-passport. I'm super pro-vaccine. However, can't see justification benefit using system like this.

The benefit governments might allow places open earlier, happen we'd need set infrastructure, would take least month two plus month people adopting it. then, everyone offered vaccine moot point. government still requiring proof vaccination business openings incredibly unpopular except select locations (e.g. Portland).

So much hubbub this? Seems like moot point anyway. require something look like something. downvote, though clinical obesity comorbidity overweight. president got jab today, since massive support, hope people follow A/C? school windows. radiators new England winters. brought ""seasonality"" see relationship virus. care whether two o'clock Tuesday. assumed meant Flu season. they’ve limited exports vaccine components slowed India’s production. worlds best friend everybody  agree zero Covid long-term strategy, would Australia capacity replicate entire supply chain within borders? Even UK EU dependent free flow ingredients, dysfunctional relationship now.

If Australia can't everything alone, there's way prioritised. eventually open borders, opening borders less important saving lives countries, indeed reopening economies countries significant epidemics. someone blows nose room goes silent heart everyone room stops beat. Pfizer, Sinopharm Sputnik V fine told get paid Kansas salary live SF well need live SF fully remote. Right! thinking this. AstraZeneca experiencing major problems production failing meet commitments countries (AFAIK) - EU. would odd Australia affected too. EU basically, except EU exports UK not. Really, inform yourself. Imported case China! Impossible China COVID (officially)! find interesting mention vaccine administered. Perhaps intentionally withheld weaker vaccines accepted. would want though? seems short term measure rollout continuing encouage uptake. Denmark, least sunset clause August. Stop it. sides hurting. cheapest one order vaccines pretty much got approved. See UK waited approved still trials.

This Month getting J&amp;J Moderna vaccines delivered. would country zero covid strategy rely countries vaccines? It’s absolutely critical every single Australian vaccinated. rate, border could shut YEARS. Wow. Clearly, eye category 5 super mega death hurricane. wait! two statements state regulations unrelated, yet also combined (paraphrasing):

* maintain social distancing least 6’

* cannot maintain social distancing, wear mask

Businesses organizations combine into, “if 6’ apart, need mask.” mean sanding sitting 6’ away unmasked people 8 hours. meant tell people. They'd gotten new leadership church he's never preached people COVID Easter, outdoor stadium. Africa like India brew ( suspect)a super turbo charged version Covid cause bit sickness slightly fatalities India Africa gut populations fat rich sheltered westerners. unreasonable amount classrooms lack windows even open... Vaccines #1 priority zero covid strategy. every single Australian vaccinated, borders remain shut. economic impact immense. don’t understand Australia isn’t producing vaccines. It’s foolish rely countries like it’s critical Australia. feel bad Australians seem dark zero covid isn’t long term strategy. got going, could probably increase capacity significantly. I’m talking current map states high cases. idea mentioned flu immune system boosting? Care share study? I'm curious. wouldn’t get airplane cancelled ton flights last year. airlines weren’t even spreading passengers despite saying were. Bullshit. Vaccine rollout EU complete disaster.
In Italy even able protect elderly people three months. I'm glad incoming tourism going boost local businesses economy whole.

That said, retail worker Queenstown, I'm little nervous frontline potential COVID imports. feel quite likely we'll go Level next couple months. Last year pubs briefly opened UK, wear mask walking building, could take seated. needed go bathroom, needed wear mask, could take seated. Keep mind lot pubs really small, distance walking entrance seat tiny. fucking joke. Makes logical sense.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 1st dose almost 3 weeks ago. interesting - you’re saying know better director CDC? following science? Please follow science. think different see someone would buy believe system, constantly reinforced since earliest childhood, especially within largely christian communities, even share believe system. I'm going dicuss here, see would lead anything.

But that's point. think whatever want. write it? gain shitting peoples beliefs way do? convince anyone leave religion, you, random internet stranger, called BS, without providing reasons(I assume could here, case, didn't), reinforce stereotype edgelord atheist, scream ""christianity bad"" chance gets, feel superior. makes life harder rest us.  there's another news saying kind relation blood clots...I know vaccine advantages VS taking getting covid, scary.

My mom got first shot, aunt dad.

I mean... probability low, 3 4 family members getting astrazeneca vaccine start get worried :( Yeah, likely reason variants (especially B117) prevalent Texas Florida yet. thought Australia makes Astrazeneca?

And EU blocked something AZ promised really have? trying say cases climb exponentially fast rate (high reproduction number), course wait wave reaches 'natural' peak soft next restrictions, usually caused hospital strain unnecessary deaths. However, measures timely implemented, curve flattened much sooner, making outbreak easier deal with. Australia ordered 3.1 million doses AZ would've sent EU export block, would mean AZ planning fulfill 100% orders Aus simultaneously fulfilling 10% EU's order. either Reuters story completely wrong, AZ reaching new levels f*ckery.

Oh sorry, think actually mean say fault EUSSR always. /s I'm going line thinking, UK following one dose strategy, one dose AstraZeneca going dramatically worse one dose Janssen, many people going get that.

So I'm going get AZ second dose, neither feel like mixing vaccines right now.

I feel like waiting 3/4 months rather something I'm going regret soon... Pretty much UK press outlet sizable portion customers appreciate due legitimate public health concern neighborly.

Civil liberties outweigh people's want feel safe. Seasonal what? Due masks distancing recorded Flu cases US past year. blocking vaccines. EU India done that.

What UK US soon vaccine approved started singing cheques instead trying get price waiting months making orders. Also put eggs basket like EU Sanofi Pasteur Institute. get past trials. opposed figiratively divulging status? could find article statement CDC back up...  think concerts shopping general, it’s really hard government sets mind partners big tech.

To go concert always need show phone paper ticket.

To buy something store 95 percent people show credit card.

Will open fraud? course, that’s edge case don’t need worry day one. 

With right amount carrots sticks use drive vaccination rates closer 80 percent. like we’re still race vaccinations variants probably good dose seasonality kind mixed in. Yeah, seem ethical vaccine young people low risk Covid risk vaccine them.

So think AZ either directly suspended, either applied older people telling risks... True, issues us providing vaccines COVAX idea vaccine passport take part regular life activities considered conspiracy theory/hyperbole year ago, yet are. US system keep track vaccinations handwritten forms, everyone claim vaccinated.

Do really think that’s record? think anyone claimed 10000th touch always winner? Yes get that, young ""life death"" situation regardind Covid, better waiting bit better vaccine. Take upvote, skeptical well, company shady controversial since beggining, eventually fall ""social pressure"" taking it. way Earth I'm going another injection thing... really think it'll bring business require vaccination?

It seems like appetite going right high, without vaccine. want safety go without vaccine anyway. know people, especially young people, limit vaccination. crowd people capture (vaccinated, unwilling around unvaccinated people) seems incredibly slim.

Then, government thing (e.g., ""you open, vaccine passports""), people get nervous basically never going away governments typically rescind safety measures.

I think anyone really cares businesses decide best interest advertise check vaccination, presumably reason get back normal eventually. government-issued vaccine passports get store/bar/venue freaks people out.

I think moot anyway. time anyone sets up, everyone chance get vaccine. Governments open up, better worse, described business reason require vaccine passports bars clubs venues.

Also: 6-12 months restrictions happen. way. state. one wants get voted office badly. everyone offered vaccine capacity limits done. Amd then, add people already COVID. summer mostly done. Bit rich say leaves Australia 83% behind schedule too. much right pissed off. One could comment 'cheek' EU snatching peoples vaccine doses. improves EU's situation detriment Australia. Cut however want everyone knows wrong here. end day EU wants think claim moral high ground here.  Tell Trump got vaccine developed them. thought diseases spread rapidly may cause illness, could in-turn lead person greater exposure risks, feeling short breath, taking masks constantly blow nose, vomiting possibly long intervals public restrooms, go medical practice school nurse (often glorified closet multiple students room queue), etc. don’t see forcing proof vaccination reduce covid cases. Cuz see “do say won’t allowed participate society” put different way, summer vaccinated twice much US UK now. sure great place! US, UK, others different politics motivations vaccine passports. question probably answered someone UK *squint* uhhh, no? code spike protein.. I'd call ""piece"" virus. synthetic change part virus. point correct - single piece dangerous. Immunocompromised patients 100% conversation doctors they're reason vaccinated. Several companies working electronic vaccine passports, according media reports. vaccinated? so, think you’re overthinking it. go. not, weigh pros cons physical mental health best you. are. Hopefully US willing loan doses Australia like Canada Mexico. vulnerable somewhat safe, outbreak occur. doubt US using many doses all. I’ve washing hands reason? expect reputation AZ go down. even impossible UK stop using AZ vaccine young women.

The EU? UK want friends it, EU big ignored world. Well shit, honey! may downvoted even link confirmed skeptical. grateful one love received shot. Even slightly increases chances, family tends bit unlucky, better risk it. Agreed, clearly right choice would never trust EU instead rely western nation exporting vaccines. Oh wait... UK making many friends exporting vaccines across world. Oh wait, total export UK: 0. Q2 good terms vaccinations EU. I’ve cautiously optimistic beginning year, mega-deliveries BioNTech started, start grow little confident vaccination situation. Thank remembering me! 

Wow. 14% huge. imagine people undiagnosed T1D would end hospitalized get covid top ADA believes many cases virus directly killing beta cells, too. wonder would really able differentiate two situations. 

The top comment good point; would easily curable autoimmune. Unless ADA ends wrong somehow virus causing autoimmune attack. Solange Du septisch bist kannst Dich eh nicht impfen lassen O.o

Ansonsten fühle ich mir Dir. It’s manipulating public opinion see shit like this. “Oh good ventilation? open window two”  Reading stuff classrooms Covid scare matter says. know going least half parents saying “See don’t need social distance! kids back school full time. lazy selfish teachers need either get back work replaced. They’re lucky even jobs!” I’ll go little corner cry I’ve worked harder year previous 5 years teaching, somehow I’m still scapegoat society’s anger #EDIT

Bring votes. think everyone knows EU alliances starting drop like flies. Even EU members happy. Govt fucked them. don’t blame distrusting. They’re right to. it'll week second shot get protection recommended public health experts. especially concerning AZ least efficacy towards new variants spreading around effectively return

But thread downvoted, worries many people think way anything else Majority, 50%, nit difficult. predictions say less 300M Q2 top 100M already received. includes 55M J&amp;J, is, 225M people vaccinated. SITKO (commission vaccines) reccommended today AZ followed second dose AZ, rather another mRNA vaccine 12 weeks due health concerns lack data. 
The goverment usually follows advice commission sets regulations according next parlament day.

It's 100% this.

J&amp;J side effects kicked hard 12 hours shot

I'm extremely tired, sore everywhere, headache, I'm chills made confirm second appointment got first shot said could 21 22 days later going later, they’d move first appointment keep appropriate window Sore arm injection site couple days slight headache afternoon told me. doses delivered end June, still week two peoples arms. risk groups mostly vaccinated June EU good summer! EU banned many? know 250K shipment blocked, that's all, AFAIK Sanofi AstraZeneca screwed EU. they're exporting almost half vaccines. Without exports, EU would also nearing 200 million vaccines although population 50% larger US.

If becomes thing (*used think idea bit joke idea starting get bit weight behind leaders people could next leads places*) EU going screwed. Instead making enemies friends maybe try keep happy. pretty sure relationship EU UK pretty much dead now. Maybe upset anymore friends?? local differences initially think places use 12 week interval now. Still Germany AZ deliveries expected like this: 
Q1: 5.7M 
Q2: 12.4M-15.4M 
So still room give 1st AZ doses. commute time spewing pollution cars buses makes brainer. 

and pretty obvious someone pushing ""foreign worker gonna take ur job unless office"" line shit - blame people invested billions office buildings trying. lose. American workers want need five days week office. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday missing shipments responsible meeting inoculation schedule. “In early January, anticipated would 3.1 million vaccines. vaccines supplied Australia,” Morrison told reporters Canberra. 

 EU spokeswoman said rejected one total 491 COVID-19 vaccine export requests since enhanced export transparency late January, seven requests currently reviewed.

So EU actually block export doses Australia another victim AstraZeneca's huge shortfall? Sure, start vaccinating 10 times faster like yesterday. might able get first dose Astrazeneca soon wondering... go back playing football get it? unsafe? Balloon dogs? So, enough talk catastrophe. It’s time stop shouting failed buy right number vaccines. Europe facing serious health crisis. People need leaders provide hope, inspire confidence.

Luckily got shot two weeks later age group opened! Lmao 6 days? second dose Pfizer taken three weeks first. majority South, Rust Belt, Midwest completely open. Maybe they'll masks schools, maybe not. depends area, school, whether they're allowed not.

That's fine. literally business, would force business increase efficiency figure cut costs. Downstream, groceries restaurants would figure become efficient food buy, too. Less waste, innovative recipes, etc.

Yes, serious question. say vaccines cause muscle aches/cramping (similar flu make muscles ache) due robust immune response. 

All nurses saying move, faster muscle cramps soreness worked out! Especially vaccine site arm.

Yes people struggling people struggling, many families barely holding together pandemic. Many families see school safe place often hide issues schools schools frequently resort punishment gain compliance, family needs help. Hopefully seeing kind environment we’ve created give us insight better. cynic saying social distancing seen pretty much anyone, good ventilation can't.

You use sense smell. problem is, course, sense smell gets numb quite quickly smell.

So recommend taking good smell **right moment enter room**. air smells neutral, ventilation probably working. smells stuffy, ventilation probably inadequate.

Fresh indoor air also dramatic positive effect cognition, recommend paying attention things. Same, assured it.

Hell, heard N word thrown around even Obamas tenior white people (I white well guess felt mind), probably made America trying move past white supremacy. creator vaccine using refuses publish trial data results wide-spread vaccination run great...well, let's say result entirely unexpected. Disappointing unexpected. India *was* really well. Election season means neither parties power opposition give two fucks public safety think it’ll impact votes. 

And they’ve probably undercounting massive differences state discernible reason. shit Damn vaccines really amazing Also, model appears purposely pick kids 4 “parents” (step parents) multiple children conflate % schools wear live longer require masks.
Not anyone Iowa wearing anyway.
So frustrating. 2nd Moderna yesterday. went bed 5pm get 9 am. chills, headache. arm hurts I'm pretty much back normal now. Maybe, 2 year old bet ass want get covid. Besides, chance virus mutate, will, could end back square one. So, protecting everyone protecting I've argument couple people vaccines, argument is: ""something up, trust it, came soon. come something six months?""

My response ""computing power increased exponentially, thousands people researched tried prove/disprove other. can't thousands people lying thing getting away it.""

How prove actual numbers? many people actually done research this? know, get idea long term adverse effects getting vaccine without ""years research."" Early mid summer 🥱  would absolutely agree need find catch kids. original comment bringing back school would allow identify suffering most. 

I don’t think necessarily happen school. need make specially acceptable go community connect people families. odds kids struggling families struggling. Helping kids doesn’t necessarily help parents. 

While sending school easiest short-term solution, it’s necessarily realistic could potential harm others helping some. guess don’t subscribe sacrificing good many. we’re willing flexible thousands potential solutions could exploring rather trying force path least resistance... still managing let somethings like [30% kids fall cracks mean, people smoke much restaurants there's little oxygen left. first dose hepatitis B shots knocked ass, along two co-workers back mid 90s. sure gotten better not. second third hep B shots nearly bad. Kinda interesting one way -- ""not bad"" first shot, ""knock ass"" second shot Nobody alive anything slavery, pushed promote bigotry anti-White hatred. 3 weeks later hospitalization continues decline Texas teams going push capacity. early June teams probably 100% capacity TBH think case -- I've already spoken people feel way I’m pretending, daycares essential outbreaks unfortunately happen. Could be. never know media 1 3 evangelicals non-white.

And black Americans likely Christian white Americans.

Source: havent covid- first shot 6 days ago. still experiencing curiously sharp (maybe?) Muscular pain left bicep. hurt flex, straighten it. Feels like arm literally tearing apart. general fatigue gone day 3. girlfriend also extreme pain arm first shot. 16 days beginning get relief. Cannabis helped. safe assume companies making rational, well informed decisions here. thinking Zinc Vitamin C media, ran majority white people, want everyone hate white people. racism excists except white people Trump actual President. Got it. /////s want go back either. time got spend WFH'ing absolutely great. commute office, sleep able sleep in. also like socializing co-workers great well get avoid that. What's love?

Now get called ""shut-in"" introvert liking working office liking socializing co-workers, look many friends outside work I'd rather spend time socializing with. anything common co-workers outside fact work place. Socializing co-workers lot times forced. fact happy hours thing psudeo-required come annoying. Even pre-pandemic always first leave office go see friends go dinner fun stuff. I'm work job, socialize fake co-workers.

Working home normal times would fantastic. office drama politics. socialize co-workers want socialize spend time with. lack commute would allow able find easier stuff hang friends, ie people actually like socialize spend time with. It'd perfect normal times.

The problem WFH necessarily WFH, fact fun activities outside work restricted right now. barely see friends, that. concerts, bars breweries likely open heavily restricted. issues normal times, thus WFH would much better normal times boring may seem now.

People daily thread get really defensive reason someone posts comment talks WFH enjoyable good, quite funny. Look, get people like working office also people rely solely co-workers social stimuli (which could never works someone fine), reasons people also like WFH also anti-social shut-in liking WFH. fact, quite opposite me. Anything makes easier spend time friends, people actually like socialize spend time with, plus me.  people forge though still value even far perfect. There's also resentfulness, someone shot #2 scheduled week out, suddenly told gonna given someone else, I've appointment almost month.

I've good patient obeyed rules frickin' year, want take second shot away me?

I mean, knew shot gonna go arm kid, I'd it, people left state point age 16 gotten access least one shot anti-vaxxers, I'll damned give appointment someone else *not* take it. Thanks! Updated. pessimist thinks soon pandemic ends, WFH hybrid arrangements going gradually return back office full time was. Without pandemic excuse anymore, management going want employees return office ""synergize"" workforce gosh darn it, Q3 earnings lower target. oughta fix they'll think. 

Hope I'm completely wrong seems like pie sky we'll able permanently WFH years come. could open door potential parts world vaccine supply issues get people immunized stretching doses. 😁😄😂🤣😥

Thank that. cried. Mine said opposite. Haha didn’t mention alcohol thing mentioned. I’m weened heavy drinking. Echoing people said: mostly fine day got 2nd jab (3/31), local pain headache later night. next day, local soreness/pain, headache, fatigue, mild fever, muscle aches body. April 3, local pain mild fatigue, completely normal yesterday (4/4).

Side effects definitely worse 1st jab, long lasting all. potency COVID almost guaranteed decrease vaccination rates continue rise

Uh, that's selective pressure works unless something like incredibly thorough vaccination suppression regime every country? Nowhere besides handful wealthy even pursuing anything like countries like US insanely irresponsible makes efforts less pointless (unless countries going permanently keep borders closed).

Uneven vaccination uncontrolled spread, well reduced immune response infection vaccine immunosuppressed populations eventually cause virus escape vaccine. if, when. Christianity. (Black people) denominations Christianity Black people allowed white churches. childhood denomination historically Black church founded Black man. Sorry hear! Hope ones ingredient. least better blood clot though! offense, get duh, please? first dose Moderna floor three days later chills/shakes/weakness/vomiting, thought dying. Whole thing lasted 20-30 minutes, small episode following night nothing since. looking forward second dose... Updated thanks! everything mental toll ~40,000 children losing parent childhood bear. Agreed, also doesn’t mean none before. think taking half cases applying vaccination totals pretty conservative estimate account overlap, disagree?

Hell I’m fine taking third cases applying it, also think specify age 18 care well. I’m done three days advertised. funny, Florida citizens won’t paperwork states international travel way things done right now. States going issue residents. rabies triple dose shingles double dose side affects. got sick two days 2

I first jab Moderna March 14 feel thing first 24 hours. took 'nap' work Monday 15th slept 13 hours - dreams like crazy! woke feeling like ended boxing match took day work. Wednesday 17th even worse - even watch hockey TV - 1 thing wanted - day work again. vomit issues, tolerate food alcohol could barely stay awake.

Thursday worked home usual took every opportunity 'shake off' catching household chores Friday back regular self.

Covid 100% find opportunity take - everyone needs get vaccine prevent \_real deal\_ going hit ya  Got first dose last week arm swole up. Like shot area solid, raise arm 😳 
If reaction first wanna know second one like. 😬 Agreed overall point, moreso tryna say magic sky daddy pejorative gets played makes look like edgelord. tell me... Lutheran went Methodist Easter service OUTSIDE. 😁 

We masked social distanced. could still carry it, vaccine protects getting covid spreading everywhere. father law constant headaches close three weeks now, following second shot. says they’re manageable, still constantly bothering him. Urticaria over, except luckily face Jumping SC. actually like 100 new cases day statewide, like 4 days. governor McMaster decided open everything lift covid restrictions force people go back work person, March 1st, time spring break basketball tournament tourist's come sell everythubg out. weird coincidence. We're back 800-1000 cases day now. ever drank mild cold?

I have, drinking made cold much stronger next day. went sniffly nose able breathe mouth, sneezing, tiredness. Granted, still relatively fine, definitely felt worse.

Alcohol weaken immune system. also, different. you’ve ever drank mild common cold something, felt fine, maybe you’d fine too. I'm fellow Millennial got second dose yesterday! biggest factor queastion ""bacteria virus?"". Bacteria geneticaly rather stable, immunity bacterial infections lasts longer, mostly forever. Viruses little complicated.

This incorrect. Immunity bacteria tends shorter immunity viruses. booster vaccines get primary series bacteria, viruses. Bacteria living organisms ability mutate absence host. Bacteria much complex organisms viruses. measels almost eradicated, dont reproduce often, fewer chances mutate.

What pox talking about? Smallpox eradicated. Chickenpox herpesvirus give people live, attenuated virus chickenpox vaccinate stay bodies pretty much forever. 

Measles replicates rapidly body. Viral titers high infected individuals leading rapid spread non-vaccinated individuals. Mutations occur measles mutations rarely occur envelope mutations envelope lead non-productive viruses, thus vaccines still work mutated measles (because make antibodies virus envelope). video amazing! Hahaha. Money always answer it’s hard figure out. Baseball parks rarely sell out, big events like opening day usually. that, make sections social distanced bring folks wouldn’t otherwise attend instead even seats empty.

The non distanced folks pack closer fewer sections (but still unsold tickets) distanced sections likely fully sold out. They're separate groups. extremely difficult pinpoint combined number vaccinated people people got infected. I'm aware scientific estimate made point. Immune system, first dose: heck this? mRNA crazy, garbage. waste resources.

Immune system, second dose: HOLY SHIT MRNA BACK!! SERIOUS RED ALERT HANDS DECK

Immune system, 2 weeks later, exposed COVID: (yawn) get 'em extended family kid ""masked"" school bring covid home eating mask less another student frequently. 
 
How's ""required"" working ya? dont know different vaccine got Hep B 19 arm soreness. rona vaccine, move day pain everywhere. Hopefully I'm immune like many people misunderstood locked down.

We lock save lives vulnerable - shielding that. (That really all.)

We locked without NHS collapsing due ITU load.

Yes, NHS saves lives vulnerable - also saves lives everyone else. Yes, run ITU beds mortality would rapidly drastically increase vulnerable population death longer ITU beds would also much larger.

Lockdown driven ITU load deaths vulnerable, whilst vaccination targeting risk death ITU admission. two related, true, lot first groups vaccinated would never admitted ITU vaccination contribute preventing lockdown except herd immunity.

If rates ITU admission one tenth locked even rates death experiencing January. suspect switch death rates inducing lock might much 5-10 times maximum rates, especially death continued limited vulnerable.

Lockdown save lives vulnerable aim ensure everyone would live ITU admission gets ITU admission due COVID something else. think it, January 2019 mom pneumonia retrospect could covid, even though even announced first case US yet. taking care get sick. girlfriend flu early March 2020 traveling, reported cases outside Washington, seems like likely much widespread.

Neither really notable Covid symptom set apart normal flu hard say. got case would asymptomatic. tend really active immune system general though, get cold flu never minor thing. could that. Anyone wants first dose eligible lie, Virginia still stupid phases. vaccine passport system. Something really hope doesn’t get replicated here.  help news keeps talking variants possible vaccine evasion headlines knowing read past point. Many see think what's use variants get past  Let guess, there’s “but”, too.. B117 usually associated higher viral load get infected. nothing special B117 specifically kids. Since older people getting vaccinated, kids make higher % cases amplifies narrative kids decimated virus. Yeah entire left side (side injection) cramped random throughout day. went walk right shot like 15 minutes felt like ran 10 miles. couple hours good though. Kneeling hurts knees Yeah. made much progress prior pandemic, last April bad I'd ever far suicidal. 2 years semi stable, erased month. People get tho.  point, actually believe it? Doubt anything changes. think we've reached point return. never said year. basically designed women

Why remove them? thought taking vaccine advised pregnant women now? mention us already diagnosed mental illness making progress/were stable, pandemic basically erased progress entirely. Speaking experience here. asshole along birx saying j&amp;j useless? don’t hope dude, it’s pretty clearly satire. RIP it’s safe, go back social distancing? it’s safe, it?

You're trying find logic none, unfortunately. want vaccinate wanted whole time?

No, were, still are, saying government going force shots them. people denying shots hopefully reap consequences. accurate accounts Vaccines take couple weeks kick in, agree - Team vax going pull thing out. Philly’s moving Phase 2 May 1st Get here.  matter much want subreddit continue, we're near end here. guarantee one people 2 months ago commenting way would vaccinate everyone wanted vaccine August given 1m jabs day. 

Children issue virus. 65+ becoming greater vaccinated daily. shit done. Funny, headline doesn’t mention that... don’t, say :) .... getting doses question something? figured common sense (for people common sense get vaccine)  hard reason someone use reason get situation. guess charismatic leaders demand obedience might get people vaccinated, mind to. 80% first dose still higher JJ vaccine. I'm gonna lot less concerned 2 weeks dose 1 personally. anyone's work place actually talked improving airflow? 
It seems many want address it. never said get vaccine though. start pushing vaccine Amazing. Everything said wrong.

Black people: ""stop shooting us""

This guy: ""WHITE HATRED!"" will, time end Administration’s first 100 days. basically got slight taste COVID stuck ICU 8 days 31... [Assume Victory great job putting words mouth.

Congratulations.

Actually, no, I'm saying people died, may potentially taking unwarranted chance order get 'needles arms' help people, them, get back form normal quicker. 

If prescreening, informed risks, heavily understood person X gets blood clots, person not, perhaps people taken vaccine. already happening companies (Microsoft). Actually even six months, remember reading Moderna created vaccine 2 days (maybe blueprints?). I’d love see places allowed open California vaccines generally available. 

Require proof vaccination cover butts, sure employees vaccinated let people want go effort faking roll dice. 

If rates shoot then, sure, roll back. Otherwise, I’m gonna get vaccinated. Let get back it. Hope worth it...(spoiler, wasn't) Add people caught get 50 going Canada:

""What vaccine?""

""You've already it.""

""We've one, yes. second dose?""

""I think knows second dose, Pip."" Hot press: Using vaccine per directions better using half vaccine... 10 vouch fb group. made many appointments way. keep open computer see updates. 31.7%, 50. Douches douches.   Sorry, treat like cold flu, rest fluids. Hopefully it’ll quickly. seek medical help difficulty breathing lowered blood oxygenation.  That’s relatively arbitrary distinction, don’t think understand you’re talking Ontario lock based cases hospitalization. Since point locking lower cases. thought entire point hospitals don’t get overwhelmed True. us got older friends could. enrolled CDC post-vac data capture. found simple efficient feedback mechanism. enroll (v-safe.cdc.gov), surveyed via text message symptoms, etc., daily period time weekly while. Great uni, good location.  really much denial/contradiction EMA official earlier said.

What said “In opinion, say it, clear association (of brain blood clots) vaccine. However, still know causes reaction,” 

Saying know causal link saying ""do know causes reaction"" thing understanding.
Since never claimed figured exact causal link see statement found causal link really contradicting said interview.

We still know exact causal link overworking muscles muscle soreness every month new study trying find exactly causing muscles ache 1-3 days exercised. accept link exercise muscle soreness simply statistical data points link.

I feel Astrazeneca reaching point.
In middle march still inclined believe that, data seemed imply link, still possible statistical noise.
But pretty much new data got fits pattern certainly make case link Astrazeneca VIPIT symptoms weaker. care kids well. 

I want kids well, sound like kind person teaches kids ignorant fearful. I'm teaching kids fearless source living Texas 31 years tired governed racist, ignorant minority. Ready flip state blue soon.

So got nothing? That's figured.  ""I extremely sceptical German"". That's German thing I've heard today. need optimism country :) That’s really fearmongering. Shortly herd immunity reached, COVID vaccine passport much utility polio vaccine passport pointless spend time money it.

People asked ID prove age buying alcohol entering bar/club far often anyone asks vaccine passport. huge numbers essential workers others choice work public, qualified able get vaccinated yet. someone prone losing things, worry this. international travel coming up, already don’t like keep track passport, birth certificate, social security card. vaccine card understandably required still something worrry losing. one done vaccines mostly given childhood. even hospitals requiring covid vaccine dentist invested lot money HEPA air filtration. industrial machines visible.   Yeah, true. falsify information, vast majority people wearing masks vaccines typically going stubbornly show up, expect let in. see every day. want make scene. hope one buys these. Oh ""drops"" 4/8? past year every company world could producing n95/kf94/kn95 masks, better air filtration, instead got nonsense like this. $300 mask. needs seen people. Germany people really pessimistic right although there's reason mid-term I'm 22 events people crowd together small places. rate we're set hit 50% population 1st dose shots 5/08 would mean 50% fully vaccinated right around end May. 

I say much sooner possible we're going start diminishing returns terms rollout accelerating, think could decent amount sooner. stay home. You’re forced attend large events like this. choice. TU Delft looking pretty good Two masks 3 ft apart, take leave it. even latest observational study done CDC I'm sure heavily biased point since touting nearly panacea past year found association 1.8% case growth taste CDC's Countries already experienced stagnation regression life expectancy, high income NCD rates, highest price pay. **This burden alleviated stringent public decisions**. Inherent factors predetermined Covid-19 mortality: understanding may improve prevention strategies increasing population resilience better physical fitness immunity.

Emphasis plenty studies showing interested. Maybe that's problem, care kids well. competition. 

My source living Texas 31 years tired governed racist, ignorant minority. Ready flip state blue soon. 

But hey, I'm gonna change mind, going change mine. i'll leave there. Hey man. Whatever lets ppl faith. Dont downer gang bang, sure. trying temper expectations case there's shortages That’s good question, referenced last year everybody said that’s issue Probably 16 Voting constitutional right. Going sports event arena not. true false? hear ya. I've engineering entire professional career ovre 25 years hate it, lol. I'm looking something less stressful work home much possible. never made huge salary well enough live good life. last year I've unemployed though, hit retirement account hard that's going hard replenish next 10-15 years. None things rights. consider normal, need normalcy get vaccine. didn’t say kill, said remove general society.

People refuse vaccine selfishness ignorance treated social pariahs. stay home want follow private venue's rules.  freedom issue. quarantine-free again

New Zealand going embodiment slime thingy coming box meme. locked half dozen cases long ago, obviously make worse. Plenty people won’t get vaccinated, don’t want infecting other. Also plenty vaccinated people get covid time, vaccines aren’t 100%. don’t want restrict anyone’s rights either, aren’t talking vaccine passport goto DMV court... really free market vaccine passports maintained government, government gives companies ""choice"" opening vaccine passports opening all.   Putting restrictions air travellers simple. airports many land border crossings. 

In terms essential vs non-essential travel, vast majority land border crossings trucks, cross border workers. Whereas air travel little that, higher amount non-essential travel. 

Clearly saying “don’t travel outside country” wasn’t enough. Actions speak louder words. contentious is, gets people’s attention conveys serious government considers be. 

Doing way means travel outside country strongly discouraged. burden cost choose anyway. still possible without cost, albeit inconveniently, need travel can’t afford it. 

Is perfect solution? Obviously not. reasonable solution net positive effect problem? Canadian government thinks so, seems many Canadians agree them. Eh. That's issue 30 - 40 years line. Somebody else's problem. Private businesses right mandate vaccines state. great move. don’t know government expand program take away civil liberties beyond Covid vaccine think wont fully vaccinated June? way argument works, logically, venue allows one unvaccinated person in, absurd.

If allow unvaccinated people matter policy, absolutely situation (a subset of) patrons put risk. I’m surprised. school day kids school pretty aware social distancing proper mask use. goes window practice. especially bad track field team runs hallways. 80% them. odds 20% don’t active enough go sports venue theater often? even still - still bring paper QR code it. People still die Easter, covid care day is. First supply problem, demand problem. 

Lowering eligibility increases demand.  presuming 'team sports' refers outdoor activity, correct? would people outside, 'natural' ventilation, would usually far apart. Meanwhile, classrooms, often badly venilated full, somehow *less* bad spreading virus outdoor activity?

Doesn't shove 'muh ventilation' argument window? f'in stupid ass people..we shutting again..just wait agree you, weird documentation show go anywhere vaccinated. write law says ""no place gets government funds ask vaccine status"" mean schools longer able require students vaccinated go school, CURRENTLY be. texas wants ban covid passports, good, that, make blanket law like unintended consequences affect things place decades. Hi yes hello it’s me. vaccine formally approved FDA, there's reason able to.

In meantime think they're unfortunately going caught crossfire vaccine passports debate. Ok chickenpox, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Pertussis (DTaP), Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), Hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae? traveling remote countries like Africa- cholera, Hepatitus A, whooping cough, typhoid, yellow fever, malaria? Surely there’s something comparable list.... Michigan's 7 day average cases recent uptick looks similar everywhere else upper midwest, think ahead rest midwest. think something else happening spread. Trump gone way. would seem two concerns, updating China getting Africa resources. never hear Latin America Im vaccinated liberal im scaried vaccine passports. wont use them.  invasive. I'm probably crazy one, feel like laws books absolutely necessary... preemptively banning something even discussed people authority seems kinda pointless, I'm sure made good press conference. Lol, calling months ago got heavily downvotes here. I’m expecting everyone wants vaccinated least first shot end may. COVIDs spread finished point. Yup, we're ""Okay yeah happening, that's good thing fucking tinfoilers"" stage particular discussion. laughably predictable. It’s contradiction, EMA said haven’t reached official conclusion yet. bet days publish something says causal link everybody say EMA seems change mind every days. think it’s even inconvenient weren’t able go parks all. That’s alternative here. Either inconvenience carrying cell phones everywhere don’t go out. would prefer? NYT story day can’t find now, yeah. clear, don’t think know fact blunts immune system’s response, recommend waiting don’t know fact won’t. likelihood parents probably fine, spreading word. sure got downvoted, I’m sure lot people don’t know find extremely concerning communication people positions uncoordinated media seems care report long report something.

The Head Anti-infectives Vaccines group EMA saying personal opinion day EMA press body denies thing internal group head put earlier.

The AZ vaccine already controversial think people positions would coordinate internally carefully around messaging public.

The governments national institutes health several countries already thing regards AZ, sometimes complete contradiction EMA.

It looks like pure cacophony public. ""If nothing nice say....""  big boys ( Facebook, google etc ) already making plans come back office. people focused making really big salaries going work far office ( FaceTime management important). end career technology could totally see working remotely- trying move ladder anymore. isn’t allah protecting them? 😂😂

oh wait.... he’s real. small circle people know got covid got jab, worst. Nausea, chills, fatigue, arm soreness.

The people covid got arm soreness.

But keep mind, affects everyone differently. could coincidence. “In all, data supports experts already hypothesized based data. is, transmissible viruses spreading easily linger longer air travel farther. Instead, viruses likely spreading either produce virus people’s airways—meaning people simply expelling infectious virus time—and/or viruses better infecting cells, thus fewer viral particles needed start infection (smaller infectious dose). data also suggests masking current distancing recommendations still effective reducing spread transmissible variants.” said could truth thinking releasing information like this??

Frontline workers UK high risk people (*that would young*) got Pfizer vaccine first one got delivered.

So really done large rollout AstraZeneca 40's yet. real data.

But far seeing types clots Pfizer vaccine. still extremely rare clear links.

They even investigated US saw cases well. example one: news stories get buried fast. story AZ giving clots front page News. seen happen article said: provide evidence support comments anyone else noticed uptick voices heads telling smash apple store 😶😅 I'm getting pretty sick seeing shit-flinging comments every single thread this. many people seem keen proven right along.

Can appreciate incredibly nuanced problem clearly information moment? point, even hunch ends right, worth recognising probably quite bit luck involved. No, used extreme charged illness AIDS point idea requiring vaccination proof normal life still demand medical information. Apparently, ineffective comparison, judging people got point.

As point sunset clause, would make far comfortable idea.  Rather reward unvaccinated let miss work, work person vaccinated... also normal duties. 2, back-to-back 8 hour shifts non OT wages.

I bet people would get vaccinated.  lot states went eligibility group fast, started hitting numbers supply outpaced demand. States started opening eligibility tiers, example, California, opening April 15. outside populated areas, vaccination rates fast high people wanted. Like central areas California, started shifting bigger cities, allowed open eligibility. COVID variants continued cause regular waves infection hospitalization see happening make sure everyone current vaccinations. data far shows vaccines well variants (well except seems P.1 bit troubling) far. really much point vaccines keep illness bay. Europeans it, we. It’s difficult. year people using QR codes go restaurants see menu. gym done away cards membership app. Anyone going already trained use things. mention vaccination cards name it, showing ID matches name vaccination card easy enough.  tons populations around world little access current vaccines. Unfortunately, tend less-developed nations. But, 5% world population estimated received 1st dose (only 2% fully vaccinated). There's lot room large trials. Marco Cavaleri, EMA’s head vaccines, said **he** personally thinks there's link. least news articles read said official position EMA. three-day meeting begun. director says hospitalizations among seniors declining half age group fully vaccinated. speculate, prediction already happening people wrong past. first time least 23% population stupid beliefs medical practices, unfortunately likely last.

23% means there's probably easy campaigns run bring immunized population higher.

If y'all (anybody) use opportunity vilify 23%, instead trying find ways convince get shot arm, y'all probably contributing problem kind way. Yep. Roll dice enough times eventually throw snake eyes. capital wouldnt investing mask R&amp;D didnt know sure stay what's problem then? talk whispers nip it. cares. could never become thing, ensure required states choose it.  No, adds another layer government interference. Exactly, first time hearing whatever OP talking about. announcement comes Gov.

We nearly full year message lose weight, get healthier, get exercise, take supplements needed. leaders probably scared offending fat people go road, even would help society whole, macro micro levels. 

They've actually given opposite message. Stay inside order food anything. closed parks, gyms, extreme cases people outdoor activities totally alone healthy 100% safe. No. future face masks bare face.

Nevertheless they're type open they're closed anyway, tells lot last 4 weeks EU averaging 1.52% population per week.

Putting back place, remember feeling like rhinoceros tranquilizer enough require vaccines go public school everything else . unvaccinated people make adult hood. point it’s much harder fake vaccine get vaccine. exhausting hour frantically searching vaccines ended confirming one phone quickly scheduling much convenient one computer. call back cancel. I'm getting first moderna vaccine 2 days!! Woohoo!!!! Aren’t tired touting doomsday events?

I'm #2 associate entire country department, want retain me, let stay home. mental physical health never better 2020 shown priority numero uno me. felt worse first dose Pfizer second. sore injection spot Purely political ASS. Citing cdc political? Get fucked. Europe mess got vaccine 💉 feel super sick 🤒 Chile using Sinovac Brazil found barely 50% effective. basically flu shot far effectiveness. Compare Moderna Pfizer 95% effective.

Sinovac however make deaths hospitalizations less likely. 

If look Chile's data cases spiked deaths follow much (although could lagging indicator too). white evangelicals anti-vaxx though.

Right. Nothing article asserts ""all white evangelicals"" are. Yeah, always wonder kinds questions whenever pin outbreaks places.

Chick-Fil-As, instance, source outbreaks fast food restaurant state.

And while, definitely see could case like 47 people working sized place McD's Arby's 5, also wonder 13 people also Youth Group unmasked every Wednesday together. Rangers fan Dallas resident, confirm statement bad actors?

It's entire leadership + media worship. Nuance

Sure. also know call spade spade. keep feeling morally superior. absolute mess, Marco? Haha yeah find telling people “oh vaccinated now” justify behavior/plans/vacation hate feel like that. Big Oregon weeks lag restrictions lifted, new cases rising, cases reported......For instance, Texas low numbers right removed restrictions.

Texas lift restrictions. 5 weeks cases still dropping. Texas' test positivity rate dropped 5% first time since May 2020. testing less, people getting sick. Ehhh company id # associated vaccine. Like serial number. could put ticket purchase would required. Thus ticket would given vaccinated person. Make ticket lock name . show ID get venue. show I’d everytime I’ve show. it’s like airports, check id plane tickets fly... yeh think it’s dismissive. know jest could actually see making statement... Osterholm wrong recently needs back fear mongering Apparently missed memo. Thanks said going back normal. apologies misinterpreted that.

So clarify, going public? going supermarket? people vaccinated? know? going wear mask? mean ""back normal"" make mistake?

Does mask protect you, protect others? masks equally effective jobs? people around continue wear masks, even need protection? people tell vaccinated looking, see person wearing mask? Given people resistant wear masks throughout pandemic, continuing wear one everyone-- you-- interest public health?

Every single answer given never anyone else. Public health actually concern. post removed misleading title. EMA already refuted this. Please route new discussion [this Thank you. used UK's figures, 50+ plus vulnerable under. Thankfully US might send Canada save Trudeau's ass got used washing hands wipe ass too. Exactly! guess freedoms wasn’t really right word. it’s general mentality. happened time time people rushing get story instead facts. make multiple stops trip.

Or find another mode arrive  place differ idea people chance vaccinated. yet. People work situations retail, restaurants like given opportunity yet. Exposure confer long term immunity (particularly variants) exposed already mean give opportunity get vaccinated opening things back masks, distancing, etc. agree basing decisions opening back want get vaccinated. soon say want ones yet. long waits get shots arms time immunity build factored too. 


States like NH want send kids back school teachers vaccinated point school issue. Many schools open person right schools charge making individual decisions based keep mitigation strategies place keeping distance students. blanket policy schools make impossible measures remain place making difficult teachers remain safe increase risk factor kids already school least days week. 

What thoughts keeping mitigation strategies (example: masking, distancing, caps many people once, curbside service) place everyone wants one actually able get one plus time build immunity? realize case numbers increased (particularly younger populations) started going Israel? prevailing theory largely due people dropping guard bit early. Waiting bit longer would kept case numbers lower. 

What yet vaccinated keep safe opportunity fully vaccinated, particularly unable to, ""just stay home""? 

Are saying consequences keeping restrictions another month two hardship consequences increasing case numbers, PAS-C, deaths parents burden healthcare workers? hard wear mask, keep distance allow individual schools risk assessment another 1-2 months? thinking allowing participate society (ie, school, work, access public services), totally see came little murder-y, ha.

But calling vaccines experimental drug shows agenda. exactly. cause effect relation misguided ""news"" article. Oh managers damn well productivity good pandemic, miss lording people holding court 5 daily meetings, they’re going push hard get back. Except we've seen people wear masks wear masks correctly.

I understand additional risk creating resistant bacteria strains use disinfectant, I'd rather see guidance surfaces careful about, keypads, see blanket advice need clean surfaces.

Most grocery stores already providing wipes shopping carts pandemic. think still reasonable clean high-touch surfaces.

All all, horse left barn. People want feel something reduce risk make customers feel safe. People terrible low-probability high-risk events across board.

People commonly *terrified* flying, drive airport 100X dangerous flight see anybody panicking that.  software engineer makes $560k unless executive. No, referring people wont get vaccinated think bill gates gonna micro chip them, changes DNA. Thanks assuming Im talking based nothing though. Also, none things mentioned anything current covid vaccines companies. work LTC home, vaccinated like 550 people including residents staff. hasnt single complication serious side effect, got vaccinated 2 months ago now. pfizer vaccine, cant really comment much ones. seen astra zeneca one cause blood clots isnt great, think stopped using one here. Obviously experience anecdotal provided evidence support comment.""

Yeah he's expert. ever called rigor, myriad articles whose source ""according experts"" ""experts say"" clotting missed, sure, potential link vaccine might be. constant back forth AZ vaccine unlike anything I’ve ever seen. Biden Fauci already said vaccine passports federal level aren’t happening I’ve seen line I've read, though time dig right now. essence: already covid, body already primed, likely hav ea strong reaction first dose. Whereas COVID, first dose primes body, second hits harder. Like I'd curious whether son reaction (and so, strong) second. acknowledge risk long-covid asymptomatic spread?

I acknowledge risk, small enough one cannot let life dominated it. especially true I've already Covid recovered, also first vaccine dose coming Friday. 

I also run risk dying car accident, point, far likely anything major happening Covid. see cowering fear, afraid drive work morning.

Risk assessment... think good it, least radically different view do. significantly afraid life am. fine... shocked support continued restrictions life needed. 4th July perfectly fine me, long end date set. long past due end date pandemic set America. vague answers officials nothing make people frustrated. plan? opinion could much they’ve ineffective. It’s true one selling distributing vaccines even now. Wow, idiots *not* ready hear Driver's Licenses. interesting question whether tracking deaths AZ right metric. cousin mid 30s took AZ got minor stroke. survived sort neurological damage result - expressed like persistent sense pins needles one side body. I’m upset. giving opinion. I’m vaccinated already gave copy card employer. It’s really personally, it’s idea it. movie theater required it, I’m person would dramatic fit it, I’d probably show card go in, still don’t like it. think places open adults access vaccines people make choices. don’t feel comfortable stay home.  significantly better delivering store drive from. What..you mean evidence one word one sentence responses backed nothing? Ok state given date later April 19? Well, country world zero cases, want covid! :0 Downstate fucking hard. 

Yeah honoring lockdowns, masks, taking vaccines hanging effigies governor zone gets shut cases spike. 

Fuck people. Hey, let's give old ""Elrond"" much credit, Scientology cult. Thank you! We're still ordering more, though. bought another 100,000,000 shots J&amp;J month ago knew already enough approved vaccine cover everybody summer. vaccine supplies gonna ramped april UK? doesn’t.

Nowhere suggested police spotless record. Yes, abuse happens. Yes, police need better training. Yes, American needs fewer guns policemen less nervous interacting people. kinds reforms possible. I've stated putative racial bias exaggerated fact media virally publicizes cases blacks killed. people remember name ""Daniel Shaver"" many remember name ""Breonna Taylor."" black people get arrested 5x drug charges

This part blacks likely sell drugs street whites likely sell drugs inside homes, street crime much easier track make arrests. said, drugs crime makes small fraction crimes, statistic necessarily relevant. excellent book topic [Locked John Pfaff. relevant question drives interactions citizens police (i.e. potential go wrong) whether race bias over-policing relative crime rates. hard judge, look [violent e.g. rape, assault, robbery, homicide, see disproportionate rates black victims black perpetrators. over-policing causing false perception higher rates criminality blacks, would expect black victim rates (unless claiming black victims likely call police white victims, unlikely). data show arrest made, black person likely subject physicality (e.g. hands-on wrestling, wall, etc) white person, data suggest racial bias (but since can't control factors, like whether racial difference resisting arrest, hard sure). weird act like efforts ban knock raids, end qualified immunity, hold police accountable causing America's downfall

I say that. strongly favor ban no-knock raids (except, perhaps, extenuating circumstances, like maybe guy holding someone hostage gun bomb). think lots opportunities reform. e.g. normally officer sued, employer covers liability. think changed officer pays liability premiums, employer compensates average premium district, insurance companies encouraged adjust rates using point system based officer's record. way, officers fewer complaints record pay lower premiums pocket difference bonus. Officers complaints effectively suffer pay cut high premiums. Somewhat analogous point system auto insurance.

Yes, right, doubt Poland massively ramp vaccination April. immunosuppressed, doctor's answer this. use term, 'medical information,' implies sense privacy apply vaccinations.

vaccinations matter public health, personal medical record. get shot, given card \*to show others vaccinated\*.

you're wrong. read yesterday Hamburg used AstraZeneca doses

NRW also seen large amounts people coming get it, state opened everyone 60. really problem, guess say they'd absolutely get vaccinated AZ get vaccinated anyways doubtfully. already ***all variants*** ripped though population. like vaccines 100% protect us, slow virus point can't find hosts prevent people go hospital.

We flu vaccine people still die that. Covid going go away like live flu people still die from. people get Covid antibodies buy get vaccine catching getting better going drive [Covid R spread.

The main issue Covid one immune spread spread fast. People getting immune got Covid everyone meet get infected every person person interacted would got infected. Honest answer: population-wide herd immunity reached. 

I think also important shut border traffic absent strict, government-imposed quarantine regime. especially important future, new strains evade immunity. 

Casual border crossing return herd immunity reached global scale. ""Virologist Dr V Ravi blamed misperception vaccine. “All Covid vaccines authorised human use guarantee protection severe disease death. protect infection,” stated""

I believe vaccines turn covid cold hospitals free carry . still go walk? uk done great trails. I'll believe see : claim seems like self-persuasion.

Here France stuck yet another lockdown, vaccine rollout still painfully slow target demographic (20-30 adults) clue offered jab looking Astrazenca debacle widespread defiance slowing whole process.

So, less talk action. Good luck MS trying find talent 60% pay. There’s plenty places tech paying full rates, dumb move. Norway vaccinates 2-3 days week still manages use decent amount. capacity still much higher supply, giving people much needed holiday going halt effort. people supposed maintain outrage keep presenting factual information /s happens healthcare get sick get fired? Instituting policy requiring technical knowledge seems even less effective. true: 

Poland full vaccination (2 doses) rate par European countries (around 4.5% population). 

Current Reserve around 390k doses (which includes 2nd shot doses transit - no, there's reserve 2.3m doses).

number vaccinations within last 24hrs 3.5k (not 3k), administered holiday. race finish bullshit everyone adopted remember global effort beat pandemic.

I mean, agree concept, ironic whole sub spent weeks shitting EU slow compared US UK. read yesterday Hamburg used AstraZeneca doses, sure takers. AstraZeneca anyway small part vaccination effort - wast majority vaccinated either BioNTech J&amp;J. Yes, contest, let's hope every country able sprint finish line soon send pandemic history books. get shot report central vaccine registry. piece paper get code checked true false e.g. ""Did person X get vaccination code Y"" registry. 

So third party can't check whether person vaccine though, verify claim. seems like sensible solution problem. 

Having ""vaccine passports"" similar can't even theory verified seems like pretty useless idea. Well daily vaccinations part embarrassingly true vaccine uptake fortunately bad. Many countries vaccinate holidays weekends even, however point Poland way less 2.3M vaccine doses shelf, rather nice 19% much better example United States. Flu transmitted DROPLETS land surfaces. Dont believe thus issue? FINE.

Next time ur friend sick, COUGH food no-contact deliver u. U zero fears infection, since surface infection impossible. vaccines have? restrictions flying there? time, mental energy. might biggest limited resource have, losing mental energy #1 reason people stop following restrictions crave normal.

I know lot working home, entirely different year haven't. normal life home, restrictions seeing friends/family, slight changes way grocery shop. people working person, hygiene theater (and legitimate safety measures) gets taxing.

Every day wear mask day. Eating tough. need carve space, somewhere, scarf lunch. Breakrooms closed limited. Sometimes means eating lunch standing hallway even outside. Even taking sip water tough. constantly wiping things down. Surfaces must cleaned. cannot touch anyone else's things, even casually. cannot add probabilities like that. guaranteed get COVID touching 10.000 contaminated surfaces. Washing hands takes precious time. stop cuz vaccines r better 

I stopped showering. Waiting CDC msg masks vaccines better use time. Finally Productivity fallen place plus everyone's saving ton money top able spend time families. people see criticising working home confused old dinosaurs somehow still can't get low iq brains day age office work done anywhere online, old school middle managers liked wander round office looking staffs shoulders checking timesheets never really anything actually productive except desperately trying make look important. Virologist Dr V Ravi blamed misperception vaccine. “All Covid vaccines authorised human use guarantee protection severe disease death. protect infection,” stated.

That's something we've remember. shots rolling in, it’s even longer unthinkable EU finish vaccinating entire adult population ahead U.K. use Council President Charles Michel’s imagery: U.K. likely finish vaccination marathon crawling fours, EU sprinting toward tape. 


Wow, talk anti UK propaganda you, seemed forget UK also 5 vaccines available time AZ pfizer already used well moderna coming April, novavax, produced well speak ready MHRA approval J&amp;J coming well.

Wikipedia says : "" *Mormons self-identify Christian,\[9\] non-Mormons consider Mormons non-Christian\[10\] beliefs differ mainstream Christianity.* ""

Since BS anyway, god god, I'm going side mormons. define christianity. definitely ""a lot deeper that"". Religion subject may interesting study historical, cultural least psychological perspective. theologists starts ~~lecturing~~ preaching correctly believe, really reason listen all, except psychological interest insanity.

If mormons believe Jesus actually son god, equally misguided christianists, equal right considered christian. rules put place pretty good reasons.

How many deaths worth ending relieve isolation. One? Two? Five? hundred? many? many people's actual lives less important social life? “The case numbers, minuscule, underscore two warnings made consistently public health officials: vaccines provide absolute guarantee getting infection, masks safety protocols remain important vaccinated long pandemic continues rage. “

Did even read article ? BAD news! contradicts studies done Pfizer/Moderna yeppppp. Michigan south week way felt like absolute shit last night, almost immediately writing comments

I feel like got hit truck, getting better though There’s point shaming masks crowds anymore. People aren’t going change behavior matter hard try, pandemic ending June July matter happens presently. 

It’s vaccines now. Spreading disinformation shots refusing get gets angry nowadays. New York State literally actively pursuing Thank you! dunno, many times *should* someone agree you’re entitled opinion feel properly acknowledged? may 7 fatalities person would alive got Pfizer moderna vaccine! I’m sure families wouldn’t dismissive fact... fact see problem reasoning actually shocking... article “The case numbers, minuscule, underscore two warnings made consistently public health officials: vaccines provide absolute guarantee getting infection, masks safety protocols remain important vaccinated long pandemic continues rage. “ wouldn't, especially since vaccination campaign bring virus manageable-to-negligible state 60 days. they'll drive fewer miles go way go vaccination center, risk car accidents increases # miles driven (especially unfamiliar locations) I’m aware, solution isn’t cramming every key detail story headline. That’s headline for. People read discussion, see comment replied reliable fact based.   feel like broken record repeating people. actually stats Germany least young women similar risk vaccine COVID. Considering many young people die COVID severe health issues vaccine even worse idea healthy young women. Thank you. absolutely appreciate people believe vaccines work willing participate trials. Glad hear North Korea looking people Tiny chance mild symptoms, 100% protection severe covid. I'm free, baby. definition “younger adults” people 65. agree that.

Fortunately, international travel dealt federally. read article headline? Yeah still focusing cases? Ppl vaccinated cases important, data around hospitalisation survival rate think people productive working home, lot people productive remote. Everyone blaming middle managers threads seems want accept fact lot people more, better work, office. goes narrative want. YEAH! hear you... Society is. Stupid greedy people aren’t. greedy people made stupid people got follow them. don’t forget literally everyone else wants society back angry it. Last time, even angry enough vote! 😉  Add 200k cases suggest 10% chance even getting infected that's pretty good odds survival. want disclose medical information, to. want show ID TSA get security, to. boarding plane 🤷🏾‍♀️. sure , mean say evidence support claim. might hate boner UK rest EU make sure vaccine fails something spreading false narrative. 

I ain't trying provoke anyone instigate anything offend anyone involved, heck even Europe.. like get pissed see shit like , ""clear link"" read article find words ""no evidence yet"" . Like wtf man? Well damn, hope easier go store vote anywhere US. Whenever someone disagrees you, always question intelligence. Yeah keep responding feel break 3 different times would understand agreed him. Maybe get picture need say agree. actually really miss coworkers, well change scenery. fairly extroverted, WFH isolating sometimes. love don’t commute though. vaccine passport prevent scale pandemic. prevents spread virus people already vaccinate point, among people accepted risk vaccinated. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis affects 5 million people per year. 0.0005% population. Although studies suggest incidence CVT could higher. 

As March 24th, 30 people 18 million vaccinated UK CVST, 0.00016% vaccinated population. Less would expected general population. 

There clear link, link current point time suggest correlation AZ CVST. clear cut. old person I'd immediately recommend get it. change young woman germany dying COVID 1:40.000. chances getting blood clots dying ~1:45.000. famous one million. Germany administered 1.5 Million doses women 33 cases counting. stat need cite.

For men 1 case. yah one million. women: much. Please specificity argument. Risks changes age. still compared 5 million complication. number factor 3 doesnt really change difference still thousand % points according headline... massive corporations power, influence, technology, etc pull pharmaceutical miracle mean average citizen gets enjoy benefits normal times. wish sound insensitive, read manual drug pill ever consumed side effects? whole thing blown proportion, chances getting clot, according numbers article itself, 0.0000004%. people aware actually pay attention bodies vaccination, actual death rate phenomenon even lower. Ok Yes, all. Including city. safer old people, seven people dying total less bad hundreds people dying per day. one’s denying vaccinations winning. question many people get sick happens  still secretly shame people wearing masks outside? used like first 6 months anymore, really. Yes, you’ve said three times already.  around people vaccinated and/or masked safe. around unmasked, unvaccinated people indoors still real risk catch it. It’s greatly reduced vs vaccinated, course zero. EVERYONE actually got vaccinated masked risk would essentially zero. always pandemic human error, virus. virus manageable people act appropriately, vaccine makes managing lot easier. People really need wait data (which article clearly states provided) attacking defending vaccine. confirmation causing relationship stating vaccine binned distribution stopped incredibly irresponsible. Data king. Wait information, processes it, listen range informed experts make informed decision based personal circumstances. Don’t overreact, spread misinformation damage public opinion vaccine could save lives millions upon millions elderly people.  article useless. offers anecdotal evidence doesn’t tell us vaccine people took. EMA already back tracked statement article says there's evidence. people mention probably post reading title like did. Leronlimab CYDY saves lives  disprove assertion Google without help me, thanks.

You're hanging hat ""states allow medical workers 55"" yes, course. Front-line workers prioritized many locations. include me, family friends, coworkers, population. 

I lying, incorrect, misspeaking. eligible currently age, comorbidities, group qualified access earlier. general population far concerned, means eligible weeks. 

Certain people 70 state got first dose past weekend, received appointment multiple failed attempts registration due multiple, systemic bureaucratic failures.

There multiple mainstream news reports announcing dates various age groups eligible certain states. googling minute would resolve question you. balanced coin would this. like saying human tiny chance growing 10km tall. I'm fully vaccinated, honestly younger person I'm getting pretty fucking sick asked things sake society society seem interested problems affecting demographic. health anxiety bets option probably refrain checking things internet. know hard especially since expected checking negative effects (and self-observation basically bane existence suffer health anxiety), experience issues, much better checking doctor rather Dr. google / Reddit (as lead rabbit hole).

Asides anti-depressants, one thing really helped past therapist introduced met concept Occam's razor. Try check out, maybe help well.

In simplest form basically says simplest answer usually correct one. example, case health anxiety get terrible headache sudden, simplest solution would something like drink enough water / sleep enough / spent much time starring screen rather developed deadly brain tumor sudden wonder places could also require cards proving HIV, diseases entry. maybe high enough credit score. Ah, think states already meeting surprising. didnt answer question.  information required acquire paper vaccine passport? Death isn’t worthwhile metric. [Hospitalizations also inching younger keep numbers relatively stable, OK. wouldn’t sure... still really hope satire 1:10,000 per occurrence. spend day touching items, holding shopping carts, opening doors, etc., risk much higher someone covid left virus surface. CDC guidelines say (perplexingly), *should* take precautions someone may covid touched surface. Problem advice there's way know real world. safer presume about, especially states areas tons covid deniers high community infection rates still, worthwhile wipe touching surfaces people carrying covid may touched. follows directly CDC advice.

I'm telling do. precisely can't know presume surface unsafe takes seconds remove risk. issue current culture around safety. reason directly responsible death seen worse, bet lots governments stop using this.

These blood clots extremely rare. might save 10x number lives using vaccine vs. holding waiting manufacturing catch vaccines.

Still, huge cultural aversion utilitarian good. We'd rather let many people suffer hands natural event induce death save lives it. Got first dose Moderna yesterday 9 am. day, felt better morning aside sore arm. (11 am) feeling bad again, slightly itchy leg arm side vaccine, headache. Anyone experience ups downs side effects like this? Yeah people really act like government perfect saint ever take advantage control measures whatsoever, anyone thinks overwise conspiracy theory nut. already walking back statement, though. deny already found connection, still looking it. sounds like one person said something have, give evidence back Well, interview one person EMA, official EMA statement new findings guidelines. said interview, expects EMA make statement coming days.

But might referring findings German Norwegian scientists believe found cause: preprint: Also, young people really die Covid. risk brain clots is, however small, worth it. I’m kinda same. Thinking everything I’m vaccinated find there’s really restaurant I’m dying go eat at. Besides waste creates, like takeout it’s nice tip. That’s bad example since know can’t cause autism. came said I’ve seen data shows AZ vaccine causes blood clots. trust him, also verify data. 

Trust verify workable thing. can’t go life verifying data. point trust experts field. can’t experts everything. No, people rarely said way possible. clearly possible, context important. 20 death cases 40 cases 20 million vaccines nothing. investigated halting whole vaccine process AZ 1 million chance? politics. Anti baby pills 1 1000 chance blood cloths people still use widely. 1000 times rarer. clearly EU sticking AZ couple reasons. prediction: You’d experience progressively severe side effects got unnecessary doses guess probably wouldn’t die. hear second dose mRNA give people pretty unpleasant side effects would continue take vaccine doses standard 2 shot regiment enjoy pain &amp; suffering. Isn’t going moot soon it’s confirmed spread rare, non-existent, among vaccinated people? Spread rare already proven CDC study. point, someone wanting mosh that’s unvaccinated taking risk. *you* read article? It’s quoting senior official agency charge medicine EU! credible anyone claiming vaccine perfectly safe, opinion absolutely heard.

I think people course correcting hard. Anti-vaccine people exist, every vaccine must perfectly safe literally harm come them. It’s anti-science anti-vaccine people are!  Show papers,Jew- Nazi correlation causation insane statement case. work extensively statistics subfield yah proof individual case. population cases: absolutely. see really rare disease suddenly crop up, killing young healthy people common one thing: vaccine absolutely common factor.

This like see lot shark bites ER people question whether really correlated recent increase shark population water one saw bite happening.

Statistically 35+ case expects &lt;1 control population EXTREMELY significant. Actual suppression: Public health leaders should
focus efforts maximally suppress viral
infection rates hence preventing emergence
of mutations become new variants of
concern (each time virus replicates an
opportunity mutation occur), a
combination vaccination continued public
health behavioural measures (such facemasks
and physical distancing). 

It sounds like they're talking next 6-8 months COVID recedes, ensure resistant variant pops us. sound like they're talking forever. could actually dangerous time variant creation. vaccinated individuals interact COVID positive people, greater chance variant emerges overcome vaccinations. continuing societal behaviors current infected population dwindles, gives virus less chance. numbers low, risk mutation greatly diminishes. 1 3000 people catch it. Catching pretty avoidable depending circumstances. work jail, yeah probably get it. 

If wfh year, take basic precautions, odds getting covid brought 5% less. 1 3000 healthy young people equally, that's going mostly sick overweight mostly closer 40. thanks! come across way, always see ""conversations"" get downvoted folks assume poster combatitve, want downvoted oblivion trying learn :) 


that makes sense. Thanks taking time respond teach! Kinda funny, Last halloween kid showed door dressed like Dr. Schnabel von Rom... (plague dr beak) Hahaha suck modern medicine (at least little while!)  Yeah anecdotally know plenty people personally particularly Pacific Northwest LA. messaging they’ve received terms safety vaccine general rules transmission abhorrent. read article instead headline? People work money. Period. Employees treated like high school kids work exposure god knows else greedy CEOs drown money value profits higher human lives. Salaries bay area higher rural midwest competition, ""lifestyle"". underpay since know can't get better offer Kansas. Ideally they'd pay nothing could get away it, best demand fair salary fall nonsense. defending credit scoring? published data clots (CSVT) suggests numbers EU seeing (44 9.2 million ~0.48/100.000) well within seen big population studies looking several years entire national populations.

How explain this? I've seen argument thrown around people present thrombocytopenia (not enough platelets) well incidence rates even higher.

Both also likely occur fertile women since lot people vaccinated Europe part medical professions, heavily lean towards women aged 20-60, I'm sure expect different outcomes looking 9 million data points. wait 19th schedule appointment schedule knowing I'll eligible 19th? day people angrily correct point virus smaller holes mask ""it travels droplets"" that's obviously wrong. 

Explain wrong. super sick yesterday. 100% normal today except necks still bit sore. Oh yeah, that's absolutely true. agree you, he's saying things return normal later year, seems pretty reasonable will. Hopefully sooner expected. UK age everyone else get People 50 without underlying medical conditions England may wait May first vaccinated order age:

Some usa states went 65+ &amp; medical &amp; certain jobs, 50+, 40+

Some usa states went 65+ &amp; medical&amp; certain jobs, 16+. Makes sense certain states demand lobsided (urban areas still high demand stuck 65+ rural areas low demand going 40+) yup. work live, live work. people social media continue say ""Oh well everyone wore masks pandemic would over"" like what?? Everyone live wears masks indoors yet cases spiking like crazy uncle lost 6-figure job due criminal charges (probably worst possible way lose job) able get healthcare exchanges less 20 dollars month.

The risk/reward calculation case absolute no-brainer. mandatory disclosure medical data massive database, accessible government certain private entities, denied certain societal norms? could ever go bad... ""I love China, here's post jerk China""

You r/Sino plants easy see inside months

So lucky enough much less almost risk getting Covid year. dealing anti-maskers outbreaks work. I’m glad sheltered reason able others risked family’s health keep fed, warm, supplied almost modern conveniences. Apparently health doesn’t matter anymore you’re vaccinated. I’m vaccinated, people well

That’s stupidest thing I’ve read today. wrong terminology. additive rule probability: P(A B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A B). Imo bad. population size geography pull zero Covid response like NZ Aust. We’ll wait see Long Covid turns well. 

But ask citizens. might preferred New Zealand closed border effort. Anecdotal tested positive first vaccine dose (healthy person 30s). felt pretty bad 2 days, never bad enough would seen doctor normal circumstances (mostly mild fever, slight cough, tiredness). thought allergies honestly.

Every day second day symptoms felt much better one before, 100% ~7 days. have, continue blow past guidelines. Neutralizing B1.135 certain extent wild type virus well dont understand? i'm proving i'm vaccinated business someone.  provide employer note doctor. provide school doctor kids ( vaccines available ) wont provide proof business... I’m saying culturally exactly same, there’s lot agree on. established black evangelicals favour vaccines white evangelicals not? don’t know. true, yes, race bizarrely relevant question. That's heard sister lives Netherlands yesterday. allowed travel dual citizen hoping get shot US July. article misses core conspiracy theories reinforces anti-skeptic viewpoint. There’s chance JFK assassinated conspiracy? There’s chance 9/11 happened differently we’re told? There’s chance virus escaped WIV?
Our institutions lost trust people, got Trump, way around. write conspiracy theories default skeptical. vaccinating almost 50-1 ratio compared cases fine, relax Jesus Christ, everyone conspiracy theorist believes fringe bullshit they’re hesitant get vaccine isn’t even approved yet wrong jumping new thing hate? never said rights. responding said forced get vaccine. next Wednesday, probably: ""When happens 6 Wednesdays row, reason celebrate.""

You, 7 Wednesdays now, probably: ""When happens 6 straight months, reason celebrate""

You, 7 months now, probably: ""When people stop dying all, reason celebrate"" covid ass?🤔 literally clarified **in comment replied to**. aware real world bit right wing/actually liberal Reddit. However, also aware power online mob to, example, move baseball game state law majority people agree with. people live house campus. could name 50 people know well gotten covid. White evangelicals regularly separated Christians types polls/surveys/studies tend specific voting block politics heavily influenced response virus. fear mongering thing. Fauci already said see happening. Abbott using stand stop something happening anyway. It’s astounding medical applications present.

“There could unforeseen consequences....”

There could also teapot orbiting Jupiter. preponderance evidence lie? 

I find reasoning much like flawed thinking used Anti-GMO luddites, constantly braying lack proof safety. that’s risk assessment works. never conclusively prove safety anything, assess certain degree confidence risk harm. 

Any evidence beyond personal feelings hesitancy mRNA vaccines pose elevated risk harm? consensus seems suggest risk infection orders magnitude greater potential risks mRNA vaccines. 

I would welcome quality evidence opposes consensus. maybe. catch COVID die down. think there’s strong overlap people won’t get vaccinated already caught COVID. First, nothing civil liberties, private businesses wish, civil liberty. Second, civil liberties not. Courts upheld forced closures, social distancing mandates mask requirements hundred years ago. that's even play here, government requiring vaccination, private businesses. hopefully it’s robust bestbuy console launches. company tripping balls thinks I'm returning office wearing mask day I'm vaccinated. infected, included, like call natural vaccination 😭 again. would this? purpose continue forever everyone vaccinated? LOL love China. I'm saying obviously would love put pandemic behind them/everyone. They're going upset American vaccine works really well. Double mutation variant immune escape (from past infections) greater transmissibility behind rise.

Dr John Campbell talked one videos last week. check youtube. (the title India mentioned it)

Also vaccinations picking (just crossed US 7-day rolling average today). nearly 90 million doses administered now. think somewhere May end increasing speed see slowdown 2nd wave India REALLY like pushing ignoring facts rollout. 

Let guess, you’re northsider that’s mad heaviest hit areas getting vaccines first. 

To add clarity, Chicago got different/smaller allotment state did.  mayor pushed vaccines communities driving spread fastest. 

These communities happen black Hispanic kicked racist shitshow chicago. 

What she’s right thing driven scientific suggestions, really pissed lot white people northern areas. Yeah, I'm balanced approach, considering 1600 people died yesterday 40,000 new cases, I'm exactly going believe that. Especially calling vaccines insult medicine complete denial mess Brazil in. Oh see. You’re P0S. Take care. Ineffective exactly? major assumptions needed make statement.

On one hand, people vaccinated long. vaccinated cases different ""person-hours"" unvaccinated ""person-hours"". would make odds less 1/500k

On hand, looks like people died infected full immunity. chances already high risk, possibly high risk point improper immune responses. would drive risk healthy vaccinated individuals many many orders magnitude lower.

My guess odds actually much better that. looks good dumb non-scientist eyes, teaching immune system make antibodies themselves? June literally pick type vaccine want clinic convenient &amp; fits schedule. they'll rolling mobile vaccination trucks fairs, piers, amusement parks, beaches, anywhere &amp; everywhere, trying convince stragglers get shot. Will.I'm.Not one biggest idiots planet. continues get partnerships serious companies absolutely beyond me. nothing civil liberties, private businesses wish, civil liberty. attaboy. Solve problem exist. Hey dude hundreds subs sorry didn’t find one wanted comment 🤫  basically telling people inhale moisture droplets see lingering moisture droplets air.

Are mentally deficient? That's entirely fair position hold. 

Don't know based, UK there's big growth loneliness among young people, well Pandemic. 

For some, work friendships among they're able get, even temporary. personal experience, one best friends, (eventually weddings going again) best man guy met work. possible 5 years we'll drifted apart moved different companies, kept closed off, I'd maybe... 2 close friends I'd interact often? 

For already well established friend networks outside work, certainly understand separation, mind, even short lived friendships worth enjoying. difference opinion see nothing morally wrong discriminating unvaccinated. r/HailSino Ditto India. EUA given vaccines AZ local one(which hasn’t done ph 3 trial results yet). Cities capable handling Pfizer Moderna everything centrally handled thru inefficient govt. top 60+ aged people extreme hesitant getting jab citing WhatsApp antivax posts. can’t even convince dad get jab trying get mom go vaccine. Pathetic situation home worse case country. Less 5 % pop got even one dose.  reverse commute 7 years - going Queens Jersey City. swear PTSD it. seems impossible able long mental health improved considerably quit job.

I look see ex-coworkers sometimes, New Yorkers still commute. might 10 years point. I'm sure realize much lives they're wasting. don’t history allergic reactions fine. Side effects don’t really come 10 plus hours later stupid. managed avoid monumental fiasco 2020 want sweet sweet Covid-19 experience? Vaccinate first, open later. this? 

And it, allow vaccinated Aussies still PCR days quarantine. Supply. everywhere.

Initially Brown letting hospitals control Phase 1a Group 1, slow rolling due staffing concerns side effects also allow time people want decided get it.

Again, response *risk you* subject *risk people*.

Your mask protect you. protect others. Others wore masks protect you. widespread testing contract tracing US never done, let alone done start really would helped, lots people asymptomatic carriers never knew it. wearing mask social distancing, spread people.

We make people wear seatbelts helmets. That's legislation does. That's public welfare is. insurance exists. 

No one going know vaccinated looking you. see person wearing mask pandemic over. stressed, impossible vaccinated, catch virus, spread without ever knowing it. people wearing mask around nearly well protected would wore mask. Idk power situation seems deliberately overworked cut costs, I'd look new job. additional shot hurt anything arm! sub full deniers. need hear rationale behind one, would seem like live streaming concert exactly sort thing want lockdown. is. misleading. competent mental health expert wouldnt say pandemic restrictions put place, disastrous effect mental health generally.

It's much harder measure years life lost due stress loss opportunity, happens. ISPs zero rate traffic means they're charging traffic zero-rated

Zero rating even banned implementations net neutrality (totally allowed Europe), think argument ""BAN MIGHT GIVE SOMETHING FREE!!!!"" gonna win charts like one linked absolutely exist certain foreign markets.

[Wait, fear monger based foreign governments state data clear conclude something, clear. Period.
Stop making assumptions based beliefs ideals.
This data, changeable.  Texas “Gov shouldn’t tell business do”

Also Texas “businesses can’t decide require people wear masks/be vaccinated premises” Ah yeah right, misread, scusi. local mayor made comment masking children vaccinated. I'm going absolutely lose it. NEVER part plan. Goalpost shifting finest. Exactly think totalitarian government abuse normalize showing virtual papers. Like citizenship database scan entering certain places. It’s horrible precedent take front, wait symptoms start happening take anything. X-ray crystallography cool. vaccine 100% effective. everyone vaccinated much less odds two 5% near other. plan seems complain till gets shots. 

Given major vaccine producers prioritizing home populations COVAX get little supplies till summer time. It’s amazing comments expressing sensible level concern worst pandemic hundred years downvoted. definite “this never happened, move on” vibe now. info outdated. They've able confirm vaccinated people transmit virus. that's whole point investigations - figure vaccine use situation. People act like ""oh well, AZ higher risk blood clots certain demographics - drain goes"" reality it'll likely result something like ""Prioritize AZ older people &amp; men, seem affected use use Biontech women &lt;40"". said betting ass, betting pelvis full FDA approval would feel differently it. it’s scary precedent set make requirement prior that. counties. I'm using numbers effect me, since I'm UK. 

Taking figures account, 27 million doses 74 cases 1:300,000. That's still good odds. course same, one implying data could trusted personally reviewed it! point analysis useless, mine. lone dissenting voice, would understand giving much attention, national bodies EU also experts argue point suspend vaccinations groups lesser risk COVID. I've collected snippets material I've read symptoms thrombosis, keep eye (or ones cannot caused panic) get help immediately arise. That's I'll anyway :). Also I'm taking Aspirin blood thinning effect, many people here. seriously doubt much impact, helps peace mind.

""The Paul Ehrlich Institute would like point people received COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca feel increasingly unwell four days vaccination - e.g. severe persistent headaches punctiform skin bleeding - seek medical attention immediately seek treatment.""

""Such symptoms include shortness breath,chest persistent abdominal pain, leg swelling, severe persistent headache, blurred vision, persistent bleeding, skin bruising round, pinpoint spots beyond site vaccination appearing days.""

""signs symptoms reportedhere specific. Also, first signs time degradation varied, although neurological signs resurgence increase symptoms days vaccination taken high consideration.""

Also onset/deaths occured 4-16 days post vaccination, often 7-8 days after. Even live state open vaccinations adults May 1, would still May, June, July get vaccinated classes start August... why? I'm curious people might, wouldn't. problematic head public health agency, expectation evidence behind statements build trust. people positions baselessly speculate pretty bad credibility getting future trust evidence emerge. Dollar General vaccine Yeah 100%. vaccine protects disease sorts someone vaccine could possibly worried kids vaccine? 

Look got vaccines kids one day vaccinated, someone chooses vaccinate kids would okay kids vaccinated nothing worry then

Pretty sure immigrants hop boarder anyway without us knowing they're vaccinated not. that's moot point, many illegal immigrants coming without us knowing anyway vaccinated great nothing worry about, that's choice can't mad friends coworkers sterile environment third life worth me. also really see value temporary companions tie workplace either us leave connection gone. superficial friendship imo.

I'd rather coworkers treat coworker leave that, enough friends is. Even there's proof said article says reach conclusions?  I'm worried worried time. surgery two weeks, want safe even though already I'm fully vaccinated. still get tested 2 days surgery make sure. really want surgery pushed back obvious reasons. I'm worried fine already fully vaccinated too. I've also got Chicken pox twice that. Voting easy GA. make effort vote early it’s 30 minute process. don’t, wait line like weirdos waited Election Day vote. digress. That's absolutely ridiculous.

Except happen still happens. ISPs zero rate traffic means they're charging traffic zero-rated. charts like one linked absolutely exist certain foreign want kill grandma, you? Oh wait vaccinated read article? one doctor offered evidence. mean world know aids virus spread? wasnt effective method spreading information every corner world? presence internet invalidates argument. Everybody knows prevent spread covid. people treated like lepers people chosen care spread deadly virus others.

Maybe talk doctor start Aspirin therapy. fine, worry thread full brim bullshit. sub become latest murica conspiracy lab? article shuts claim immediately even bothered lift finger click link.

Studies done masks distancing restrictions Pfizer Moderna done contagious variants became dominant.

Once restrictions lifted, even transmission reduced, we're back shoulder shoulder everyone seems reduced transmission mean much, transmissibility zero, there's extra precautions involved. enough data yet know effective really is, long lasts, truly well protects variants, P.1 concern moment.

Didn't know sure actually send shipment AU. side effects? main danger COVID always long-term

I think 550,000 dead Americans would say otherwise. absolute horseshit. everyone vaccinated except kids would need restrictions since almost nobody would risk. Kids already safe. That’s left last. 60m kids US got COVID time, would expect 2500 deaths. many days elderly vulnerable would hit numbers day. think anyone going twiddle thumbs end summer wait anti-vax moms come around, think again. “that’s Bible says end times upon us part it.”

My father cry conversation this. know more, continued caution smart course.

No. continue live life fear something little chance harming me. Otherwise would never leave room, due things could kill me. 

There reason believe full vaccinated person needs continue shuttering life fear. Life full risk. another super small one add pile. work software development.

Personally, love working home. I'm productive. saved hour half every day 10 bucks gas every day 45 minute commute back forth. Also, think good small towns (this complete theory). Instead everybody driving city work time companies located, people likely live outside city. lot people move close city save commute time, could live anywhere work, would probably choose smaller town cost living way lower. New York City hard time right getting people move back city people realizing living NYC expensive work remotely outside city chance get. whole thing fascinates me, hope companies decide go way remote pre-pandemic.

Appreciate Q&amp;A provide nuance depth professor known for. Interestingly, though, headline largely proved catnip skeptical COVID, restrictions vaccines (if drill social sharing), prof takes COVID seriously, generally favors restrictions backs vaccine. reason perhaps others beyond crowd (and nuanced discussions here) focus point, though, many ways distinction without difference larger debate. view yeah, worry variants, COVID dangerous ever was, especially high-risk groups vaccinated long covid. guys even read article? even say : provide evidence support comments. second paragraph. mean least wait proof data madness. chances getting blood clots way higher standard contraceptive pills plenty common drugs, half even save lives, yet nobody bats eyelid taking those. something countering virus that's already killed millions worldwide people thinking taking infinitessimally small chances side effects? Christ swear people who'd standing deck Titanic demanding see safety assessment lifeboats sink beneath icy waters.

Personally I'll wait see evidence, work risk based balance probabilities. Compared virus proven kill around 0.5% people catch it, reckon I'm taking chances vaccine. I'm looking consensus amongst vast majority qualified medical experts still *massively* favour vaccine yet reading hysterical comments think people dropping dead thousands receiving it. Statistically, massively better taking tiny chance blood clot significant chance COVID illness.

Not young woman significantly higher chance blood clot, much lower chance severe COVID case. almost evens out.

In Norway almost many deaths blood clots COVID deaths *in age/sex group*. Yes, fun games someone gets infected... Cool, thanks lot! Looks like I'm eligible yesterday AIDS spread via air droplets stranger breathe 2ft away? 16 17 year olds via pfizer case anyone wondering genuinely don’t understand story blown much has. UK something like 30 people developed form ‘clotting’ 18 Million doses. 7 died. 7 18 million people. bet people killed traffic accidents way get vaccinated.

Meanwhile deaths UK regularly low 10s every day cases plummeted. Look Reddit you’d think thousands people dropping dead blood clots risk clotting isn’t worth vaccine shelve AZ forever legal every state. Florida's executive order illegal toothless unlikely state legislature could make law banning anyone small mom pop businesses interstate commerce clause. Plus word vaguely suddenly infringing standard practice multiple industries dates back century (for example requiring vaccines work healthcare attend school). larger unvaccinated population means potential opportunities virus mutate become vaccine-resistant. 

Okay never go prove we've vaccines H1N1 go venue yet able vaccinate enough people bring transmission rate control without unethical advocating for.

So justifiable compel others duress amounts defacto mandatory vaccination law instead, always done ask people get vaccinated free will. Lol. You’re hysterics possibility concert venue ask you’ve vaccinated think it’s *other people* live perpetual state fear panic? going dramatic change, yes, vaccine deliveries going ramp exponentially. kids school started back hybrid model last week.

Wife got Pfizer shots weeks/months ago want travel summer. willing get everybody vaccinated. test every 48h? please... admit happy restrict others freedom rights want yet. 

Also, even care, it, safe, putting risk, understand want impose others?

From someone work small suburban district medium funding comparable districts. 2 summers ago HUGE mold problem almost buildings. HVAC system got upgraded every building that. I'm pretty thankful happened us I'm positive we'd boat districts. pedantic, difference government ""mandated"" vaccine passport saying vaccine passports needed. 

There nothing stopping private companies (like airlines) implementing vaccine passports requiring them. 

Just like government can't restrict free speech, Facebook absolutely right to. became eligible vaccine today able schedule appointment tomorrow. Anecdotally everyone know able schedule appointment days becoming eligible. adults eligible vaccine states.  walk across border get detained not. turn know released general population eventually. facts. even arguing? numbers according CNN unless think that’s fake news statistical models developed based sample data. suggesting done students staff deserve clean air, pandemic not? think theory already infected covid first shot give similar reaction someone hasn’t infected getting second shot. know credit score ready form social credit. based whether you’ve things deemed acceptable dictates like buy home, car, etc. one infectious haven’t got COVID, since she’s fully vaccinated, chances ridiculously small.

The fact one jab already means likely already protection well.

If getting tested due encounter, it’s complete waste time! They've coming months now. easing restrictions slowly situation getting better.

Meanwhile, Canada, cases teasing, almost entirely young unvaccinated people. older groups, clear vaccine working.

The think we'll need careful keep short delay doses cancer patients, studies show immunity wanes faster. news vaccines work even Israel doesn’t pay them.... mean pandemic pretty much UK vaccinating well half adults 60% AZ 40% Pfizer, trash? 

Pfizer / RNA vaccines clearly medical breakthrough make vaccines trash. They'll still end pandemic I'd still much rather AZ nothing. Yes, spot point. Even UK, people want impose restrictions hospitality exactly sort people rarely go places. extremely unfair. costs associated establishments implement every new feature astronomical. Places closing people losing jobs. 10pm closing time similar effect saying too. fact, people went house parties afterwards. argument flawed assumes infection covid nothing. premise wrong. risk infection increases decreases *volume* covid exposed. goal disinfection perfection reduce significantly amount covid virus could exposed. even sound disinfection techniques yield 100% sanitation every situation, using far effective nothing. relevant situation people standing within close quarters other.

Blood donation? Definitely relevant. work chemistry lab opened doors boosted hepa air system fan speed.

The difference airflow perceptible.

Fortunately upgraded 40 year old air fans roof mid 2019 haha actually helped. Yeah. Apparently related Australia. think vaccine govt wanted vaccinate almost whole country found linked rare blood clots relevant. knew. specific study link I'm guy asked, I've seen many studies reports importance Vitamin (specifically regards respiratory illness) really need evaluate overall health country. one point, vast majority ICU admissions Covid specifically Vitamin deficient. 

Taking steps boost immune system (exercise, proper nutrition, vitamins) would go long way improving overall health. 

Anecdotally, entire family Covid, single one us single symptom. take vitamins best get exercise regular basis. sick single time since Covid started actually started paying attention goes body. EMA MHRA yet say risks outweigh benefits changed, they've said consistently throughout investigation extremely rare blood clot. 


Perhaps future certain age groups, perhaps won't. go current advice is, offered vaccine age group take it. 


I think perfectly reasonable ask (not all) European countries gone recommendations EMA regulator well disagree regulators MHRA. One shot tequila good, two better.

It’s genuinely simple. Generally given choice provider administering one approved vaccines, often times receive shipments one choose based make appointment.

[This allows search vaccine sites filter vaccine. 

The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer/Moderna) practically identical, compared J&amp;J effective preventing infection entirely. appear similarly effective preventing hospitalizations death. I'm sure prone side effects (there's increased risk anaphylaxis mRNA vaccines still low %), though mRNA two doses that's 2x chance reaction sense. Pretty sure current Cdc guidance fully vaccinated people may exposed need testing either, unless develop symptoms, no? 

Although mean testing things work, yeah that’s going bit pain certain groups people think. Probably eventually go away though.  pretty clear ""additive risk"" means context multiple independent events sequence. 

You apply additive/addition rule mutually exclusive selections within event (for example, probability rolling 1 2 fair die? 1/6+1/6 = 1/3). literally statistical probability construct allows independent events *ever* directly added together that's literally probability works. saying post pedantic (and quite frankly incorrect). 

Trying claim two posters referenced believed naïve approach statistics saying ""additive"" ridiculous. clear mean making fake principles ""additive risk"" meaning something specific probability/statistics doesn't. 

[Here's actual applied used ""additive risk"" biostatistics. Note examples look intersectionality two different variables/events, independent event repeated again. one would *ever* describe additive risk way obviously not. Cheers want hear propaganda. Ruhig Brauner. I'm pulling ass. Sanofi actually fuck up, articles hard find them. blame them, mistakes happen. Pfizer/Biontech ones pulled whole thing without major incident. Even J&amp;J botched millions vaccines recently. 

The EU's current problems simply mix bad luck incompetence. Comparing apples oranges here. 
Last April, 1/ many people either place Covid. Now, millions have. 2/ vaccine. Now, millions vaccinated 3/ personally believe masks much anything, even believe it, factor dramatically increased since last April. lived promise cheap easy solution pandemic world, sense failed.

In SA work variants. 
In AUS/NZ would dangerous covid people.
In EU company UK trying play politics.

I would still take offered national project done harm view UK good.  Older classrooms necessarily sinks either. education done little money get away with, even windows optional. 

I completely agree last sentence. already government website... moment got vaccine reported state department health. Well username checks out. cancel culture bad ones it? I'm confused. really think it'll bring business require vaccination?

It’s whether customers willing go. It’s whether states allow it. it’s choice “stay closed little longer” “open vaccinated people” that’s brainer businesses. countries part production chain. EG: Lipid materials come Canada IIRC also US (but may wrong latter). suspect many exports would still happening even ""EU first"". happen software engineers; demi-gods made right life choices far superior anyone STEM career. pretty sure bot? I’ve read exact comment word word least 3 times sub. It’s extremely suspicious. It’s also anti-vax misinformation. Haha tell generalised anxiety disorder! fair, afraid asymptomatic spreading covid unknowingly. work vulnerable patient group also help care elderly Grandmother. able live guilt infected someone. rules bars/restaurants looked good paper people don’t know anything bars restaurants. state 11 p.m. closing time restriction. paper looked like made sense young people late night social distancing. closing early would fix that. reality young people coming 8 instead midnight. Mixing dinner family crowd. bars close going house parties it’s still early. way get cruise vaccine mandatory. Last time checked wasn’t likely get one August (I’m Ireland 30 years old).

But actually true would fantastic experience bus high schooler 80s, vent pot smoke. You’re right. time, it’s still race vaccinate many Americans possible “variants concern” infect Americans still trying get vaccinated. [About 32% Americans least one shot ~18.8% fully vaccinated (including 75% Experts estimate need [~70-plus % hit natural vaccine herd immunity. 

We’re definitely getting closer every day. 

From OP article: ""America appears done pandemic,"" said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director Center Infectious Disease Research Policy University Minnesota.

Az shady start wouldn’t see problem waiting you’re ready return civilization, get vaccination. that’s next winter, it! honestly fucking hilarious watch people defend like government track record implementing crazy shit never goes away inevitably ends stripping away freedom. Every time opened eased restrictions, infection rate went up. hard.

Restrictions falling cases falling (in places). statement longer accurate due vaccinations. can't tell three incidents two... articles similar. Nevertheless, seems Toronto seems pretty good detecting fake documentation. 

All said, none articles posted people presenting forged vaccination documentation (the topic thread). like trying claim widespread voter fraud, proving pointing articles people forging checks. happen we'd need set infrastructure, would take least month two

It's bit complicated adding probabilities (otherwise second throw 100% chance getting heads), repetitions higher risk get arbitrarily close 100%. Testing/verification etc distractions core issue. issue hand $2,000 fine levied. 

Force folks quarantine home issue goes away. can't stress enough.

Every time, **Ev-er-y Time**, new standard becomes norm money always go upward. Lol 40% ... conservative

[No, 32% population least one shot ~19% fully don’t know many Americans natural immunity still aren’t sure long lasts infection. don’t think anyone assuming wasn’t linked, even wasn’t confirmed. Simply unknown causes severe is. surprising side effect vaccine. medications vaccines pretty severe side effects.

The fact remains still catch Covid get shot. therefore one completely safe. ask, what's endgame? well yes, thats vaccine percentage indicator (efficacy) for. Every person taking % chance getting immune. even immune, still get sick... don´t need go hospital clear illness own. fuck would ever agree commute 70 miles one way first place? source widespread fraud alleging? 

All I've seen wide-eyed, clickbait news stories buy ""cards"" dark web. put much credence reports widespread voter fraud US. 

You need proof claim widespread problem... allegation ""theory."" Show data.

Kids 18 getting hospitalized covid significant number all. something like 800 hospitalizations 75m age 18. really understand argument is, I'll try give context (Not doctor): 
AZ general inflict fatal blood clots almost neglectable chance side-effect. Almost occurances happend second dose, goverment wants prevent deaths issuing second shot better understand happens.  
It's careful approach, regards far delay vaccination rates, suboptimal. want save much trust vaccines possible, people grow apprehensive. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Regardless, see Fauci's predictions, understand he's purposefully conservative sake caution. remains seen. people need 2 dose vaccine minimum 5 week period first dose point full immunity per studies. assuming get vaccinated May 1 per Biden's rollout, full immunity end first week June.

In practice, people get Moderna vaccine, 6 week window. people schedule late May, full immunity early July.

I think fair venues open people full immunity, fair assumption everyone full immunity then. hire public speakers w/ background disease/epidemiology/etc.

If they’re messaging issues, get someone knows give clear concise message won’t redacted later. everyone else vaccinated Illinois use SS registering. 5 different companies including mass vaccinations center Cook county Remember saying airborne year ago would get downvoted like hell? here's thing: that's totally fair! *want* organization like FDA changing make recommendations like this. people Canada keep making big deal manufacturers supporting straying tested dosing schedule. course wouldn't!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, course does. guys think liberal states drop mask mandates people get vaccinated wait children are?

(I'm sensing extremely toxic political issue next months) didn't. usual reddit, everyone reads headline rushes post ""see, right"". wrong, vaccine killed people covid 0-39 group (5vs3 far). redditor statistics Porque los dos?

Seriously, someone explain one me. think pronounced You-zhian? seen times now. think weird trend Canadian redditors. sure started though. definitely silly though Thanks admitting you’re going argue fallaciously second sentence could stop reading right there. right, evidence yet.

Is EMA considered credible? one ""WHO let experts out"" kind situation Hey, want libertarian society, I'll gladly make trade you:

Private businesses can:

\- Ask vaccines (or not)

\- Provide service (or not) anyone (or not) reason 

\- Pay people wage successfully negotiate, minimum

Oh, sorry, what's that? willing give minimum wage forced sales? Ok, we're going argue stupid vaccine thing. I’ve trying check numbers I’d interested seeing mirrors last year. feel like increase areas increase 2020. 

Hopefully Arizona Florida continue rolling vaccines regional (something got downvoted beyond belief insinuating last July) they’re next. It’s based vaccination rate also COVID situation country export going to, whether country vaccine production. Australia’s tiny infection rates AZ production, exports AZ granted Australia right seems unlikely. likely, AZ knows isn’t even trying export Australia moment still massively behind deliveries EU. truly hope you’re kidding Funny - back 90’s guys worked sessions work discuss tax implications ISO NQ stock options. coworker guy pushed low fee index investing me, firecalc website always popular discussion lunch. 

These coworkers alway fully funded 401ks saved enough put kids private schools college retire 55. yes know people money. invest future. crazy people eager give freedom away  Risk dying childbirth UK 1 10,000.

Do get filled dread horror every time someone announces pregnancy? I'm ready go back. miss desk coworkers. would like ability work home though! Snow storms, kids sick, cold, could work home easily cases. I'm hoping remain option. hate use PTO sick home sick kid times year. Like reddit, vastly underestimate difficulty ramping mass producing millions doses safe vaccines short period time.  sports themselves, social get together driven sports, driving/carpooling activity teenagers associated sports? headline uses words 'could', 'may' safely word 'won't' 90% time.  inconsistent messaging. Small government, unless woman, want smoke weed, forced something responsible for, cause freedumz. DFW ignore every single thing says mean, tested positive. teacher forced back schools likely kid it. spent time going get tested. get tested often cause they're free, easy, gives information keep people safe around me. never feel like they're waste time. ""Maximum suppression"" startegy perfect frictionless world consisting spherical humans traveling straight lines. actual reality average person going suppressed more, maximum otherwise. politicians, like get win elections, going enact unpopular suppression policies. agree results depend type test quite lot. 

Sero seroprevalence means blood, blood tests covid least mostly antibody tests, think anyone screens those? maybe mean prevalence?

For non-blood tests, PCR tests produce many false positives, that's big issue, time takes result - even without waiting time still half day running means useful testing show work something. Antigen tests faster, false positives problem. Learning past diseases actually problem. used playbook used new strong flu strains like bird flu swine flu. 

But flu mostly spreads surface contact masks (for non-symptomatic people) don’t whole lot pre-symptom spread fairly low flu. 

So that’s nobody initially thought masks worth focused surfaces initially. I’m complacent. think cried wolf histrionic long. People aren’t getting message.

What realistically think going happen now? aren’t going lockdown, vaccine v variant. true, isn’t, better buckle prepare deal rest life. Personally life already back normal, fun! Thanks, edited post Yeah, go well developing countries. 

'We want vaccine, risk blood clots'.
'Wait, it?'
'Because poor choice. Sucks you'.

Do really think conversation witnessed global scale already causing severe doubts developing world? private chat amongst EU countries know. rate average. percentage population slightly national average percentage doses administered slightly average comparison states looking Bloomberg. think biggest reason surge really low cases per population (we rank 42nd nation) states lot higher percentage combine together immunity past infections vaccine immunity. Ah yes, goal posts next dimension sent nth dimension point. lot folks jaded towards government / politics. cases rightfully so. However market dictate whether passports stay long term not. becomes way generate profit stay. becomes liability sends consumers competitor services passports quickly fade away. consumers decide unless forced upon us government. 

Now, government would that? One speculate imo crisis ever goes waste power. curiosity, vaccines using Canada? I've 1 shot AZ I'd love get second one country suspended vaccinations AZ. supposed second shot yesterday. appointment already scheduled got cancelled.

How many ppl EU got AZ shots far..50m? 100m? many got blood clot issues...maybe 100 total? Nearly 2500 people died Covid EU yesterday. I'd rather take chances AZ vaccine. Almost everything said beginning transmission subsequently contradicted. Which, yeah, example science self-correcting also example regulatory agencies talking asses. Remember said masks useless BEST possibly made things worse? 

It's one thing know answers actively put wrong information. What? know implications company falsely claiming something like that?

That's absurd claim.  vaccination rates go test positivity declines risk analysis changes. Nobody advocating government mandated vaccine passports.

You're looking something outraged over. Go outside. social credit score talking point something way people talking about. States record vaccines I’m pretty sure. think, though, vaccine stuff moving fast point even requiring vaccine. Yes ive basically working whole career home im dying go office. downtown office would nice skyscraper view harbor like would nice. lonely easy procrastinate home like coworkers profile picture teams dont even know look like genuinely think AZ table comes US, see using here, especially given much Pfizer, Moderna, etc. small studies showing 10% efficiency SA variant can't imagine US interested administering here. Based data? people disinfecting everything sight past year. control group? use contain certain amount copper. Yeah, unfortunately likely happen winning lottery. tried last time...  amount assholes US arent getting it, good sign rest world.

 Fucking Texas rangers (the baseball team) probably got 100 people killed w shit mask mandates start NY. one social group I’m contains mostly teachers one school system. Every. Single. Teacher. In. That. Group. Got. Covid. 2 3 non-teachers not. Coincidence? Maybe.  I'm going respond think selection bias peoples perception likelihood side effects. 



I much like you, mild arm soreness doses. went 4 mile run day second dose, issues. parents brother-in-law same. 



You see many people forums like post bad experiences fun come say ""I felt totally fine"". Everything political cosplay. Find issue makes base get ruled up, throw red meat. live here. good Governor. Facts U Dislike Yeah Pfizer.. german high tech :-) hero car's garage. 

Seriously though, argument wash safer alternatives available. people going die result, age group, people need die. pushing vaccine “operation warp speed” since beginning That’s always case. people aren’t going get tested don’t symptoms. I'm YUGE privacy nut, I'll first line vaccine passport travel. Pre-covid traveled TON work, anything get back status quo I'm for. 

I mixed feelings scanning go local McDonalds, ""papers please"" aspect, simply trust corporations implementing government use element building complete profile me. Facebook Edward Snowden, think enough precedent worried data privacy. Presumably every scan ""verify"" passport geotagged time, place tied identity. like idea. 

So even though I'm fully vaccinated pro-vax get, choice two restaurants one mandatory checkin one without, I'd choose one without. me, privacy implications clear present danger life risk covid (young, healthy, fully vaccinated person) point. 

I actually stopped using Google maps reason realizing de-identify data: reason use facebook whatsapp anymore prefer Signal. Patriot Act. TSA. income tax. temporary measures. Life going same. still need weekly tests schools. Covid Passports become thing ever that's going look like. Life part go back normal normal knew.

Think like 9/11. still travel effects changed travel forever. Trust flying fast easy hardly checks.

We still travel different. life covid. still able everything could done differently. Sounds like problem. suspect thought might dropping hilarious zinger, answer resound ""YES, like brazil"". strong seasonal effect, peaking winter low point summer. 


Ironically, using USA example would better you, since clear surge summer - due large portion populace abandoning simple precautions 4th july gatherings, summer vacations, etc, superimposed strong seasonal effect coronavirus. mask mandates start last year though? 

New York started states followed lead.

Just states rights, mean take ideas states serious difficult decision.
I understand spirit idea, agree obligatory vaccines children going school.
I also agree mandatory masks.
But agree discriminate people trying help.
In case I'm young (ha!) healthy (ha, again) receive vaccine country. means I'll receive mine probably November December everything goes planned.
I'm working adult house, someone tells cannot receive service vaccine... would unfair could unnecessary stress family.
People making decisions based feelings (fear, anger, disgust) thinking consequences. Nice. Australia well already almost COVID-free. Another apples oranges comparison. country like Australia covid? take AZ vaccine? Hello me, bot. I've come downvote whiny idiots screeching civil rights freedoms taken away. Oh thank god they’re white. important info!!!!!!! green evangelicals said never would listened. IFR 0.005% 16. 60m kids. well established facts. Literally 2500 kids possibly risk dying this. We’ve marched grandmas death thousands every day year. 2500 kids doesn’t really faze all. 

And we’re clear: You’re following science. you’ve done outsource critical thinking needs unelected bureaucracy. Following “the science” isn’t following “the scientist”. work yourself. can’t quote people feel smug. Yes Exactly. private businesses want private businesses. private businesses forced choose indefinitely staying closed due overbearing state governments.

Even policies arguably necessary now, 2 months. 2 months requirements part reality extremely hard roll back. well country atm still uses AZ age groups, frankly atm alternative otherwise! fan Bowser played bad hand well Cases slowly starting come back NYC; I'm hoping good now. sounds like HIPPA violation. :( UK probably given 10 million Oxford/AZ vaccines 60s give decent signal. 


Cost benefit analysis old people extremely rare blood clot good chance dying catch disease also different. turns 20 years olds, risk dying car accident driving vaccination centre higher risk dying covid, advise get vaccinated altogether?

Once start comparing infinitesimally small risks make recommendations really make sense public health level. Anyone poo pooed believed come hot medical takes without waiting evidence. includes lot officials. 

It's risk necessarily outweighs benefits- professionals either lied spoke asses try pretend exist. I’m going game couple weeks man can’t wait. Yes that’s Attorney said, trust. pay him. really sucks, need stop giving vaccines.

From public health perspective, probably better keep plugging along short term given much likely die coronavirus vaccine.

But anti-vax community going eat shit up, even one million chance encounter complications vaccine going used fodder conspiracy theorists, likely result fewer people getting vaccine.

A shitty situation, but, case, science actually worked problems identified due stringent monitoring large samples people. them, Guardian, BBC etc. alter boys, can’t hear complaining! Monitor color accuracy matter printing anything. Yes, provided equipment, equipment subpar compared personal computer, use that. 917 said “it’s additive”. technically true, since one said was, it’s weird statement.  think confused.  Risk increase without additive.

Mzman said additive.  wrong think mean “it goes up” (and don’t quite understand additive probability specific thing doesn’t apply here).

Correct answer it’s multiplicative. it’s much easier understand think odds getting covid touching surface.

First touch odds 9,999/10,000 you’re fine.  0.9999.

Second touch would (0.9999) * (0.9999).  it’s odds fine first time odds you’re fine second time.

Repeat 10,000 times.  (0.9999) power 10,000 0.3679.  That’s odds make 10,000 touches without getting infected.

The odds actually getting infected inverse = 0.6321.

You likely infected infected, it’s guaranteed.

In real life hardly anyone touching 10,000 contaminated surfaces it’s almost mute point. Hospital workers would high risk, also even higher risk droplet spread.  

It really applies cleaning staff, who’d touching surfaces directly exposed coughing patients relative risk surface transmission would high. wait? people work mandated get vaccine then? Yup! Marissa directly responsible case. backfired she’s still millionaire. SMFH People underestimate grandiosity numbers here- country alone 30 million cases 330 million people. Even 30 million diagnosed factor 6-7 (~200 million it) still leaves around 130 million people still get it, spread it, die it. 20% population fully vaccinated. pro side preliminary basis seems like vaccine generally effective known variants. 

The basic reality seems unfortunately going around issue time. Hopefully variants don’t lead drastic reinfection whole process starts again. Difference alternatives AZ vaccine. 

Completely abandoning AZ would postpone vaccination program three weeks. risk death COVID, we’re seeing low death rate, risk groups starting get vaccinations. choice go one vaccines. earth wouldn’t I? I'm young J&amp;J hit everyone else age like truck like 12 hours data wildly inaccurate. Nothing close 30% long COVID Curevac production ramp 2nd half year significantly. local factory already preparation steps 50 mio doses 2nd half 2021 plan 200 mil 2022 one factory! won’t “happily” wear mask social distance 2 weeks second shot unless I’m legally required to, own. Plus technically fully-vaccinated population point tends elderly, high-risk health condition, essential worker (who may well get clouds germs face daily basis). vaccine working well groups, doesn’t seem bad all. percentage refusing vaccines already COVID. would surprised least 5-10%, certainly enough put us top herd immunity. share examples ""large events""? I'm certain seen density closeness concert fully filled sporting event Unless turns reduces transmisibility. think find pretty soon UK. feel you, pandemic feels really like kind ""hard times"" characterized ""not able relaxed times..."" Guess what, people still dead.

My post request vacuous platitudes. GTFO. Many women take birth control pills. Many women don't, precisely worry side effects. That's much uncomfortable alternatives like condoms, IUD sterilization widespread. pill taken ""without second thought"", almost one would use those.

Also, one would question woman's decision take pill prefer alternative. AZ, people refuse called anti-vaxxers spoiled wanting alternative.  I’m looking forward possible side-effects second Pfizer shot lol, parents (70’s/60’s) experienced zero side effects second dose, experienced none first.

I’m planning taking two Tylenol second appointment, weed Tylenol case experience side effects overall good! focus hospitalizations deaths accurate way track pandemic majority vulnerable populations vaccinated

I strongly disagree. perfect accurate way track this, especially even everyone vaccinated, vulnerable. clarify, think perfect way track terms closing imposing restrictions people. even true 6 weeks everyone wants vaccine likely least first shot couple weeks time immunity set that. first dose Moderna gave permanent ringing ears. getting second shot. Anti-vaxxers scrolling Facebook Instagram recording lot numbers dates administration make plausible-looking fakes if/when need provide proof vaccination. say, hard print blank CDC card. 

If going vaccine passports (which think extremely bad idea, digress), system set beginning secure handwriting card. non-starter ""proof"" vaccination easy fake. 8? could give several dozen names. church covid cluster. good reason optimistic rate vaccinating Ok. seems inconsistent narrative US terrible healthcare education systems fat. Many states hosting large events months cases still dropping states That’s kinda point. happened sub, comments shit show Germany example 20 million 60+ people

Of Millions already received mRNA - AZ going supply merely cover 6-7 million people June.

Germany expects 12.4M 15.4M AZ doses Q2. 12 week distance get 2nd AZ dose Q3. Mostly younger people received 1st AZ dose recommended receive 2nd dose mRNA. Factor people refuse AZ, Germany might end AZ use. chance getting infected reduced 80% compared unvaccinated correct way describing it. take 10 you(5 vaccinated), put phone booth covid patient. 5 people infected, one vaccinated 4 would unvaccinated. 

It mean 80% covid positive covid proof. I'm finally getting vaccine hours! 27 years old waiting patently seeing friends family get it. I'm sure one except 2 dose one lol. nightmare trying schedule yesterday county full I'm road trip Watching journalists cover shown science-illiterate really are. It’s baffling. Ah, well. long part ""not 100%"" matter, right?

What, worry? speaking third world countries Canada change wanting enjoy life consumerism? Maybe people want happy type headlines piss end safer options that's like choosing brand new honda known brake issues brand new toyota runs perfect. Sure honda may kill you. fail blue, risk better option? thanks got shot. kicks fully Friday. worry pretty much zero point. people vaccinations goes religious beliefs? religious exemptions vaccine mandates currently US US industrial powerhouse. Literally one world's two superpowers, enormous biotech sector.

It already *had* capacity ready go. Biden fully activated it. They're mining plague. young Brit whose country 60% vaccinated (with least 1 dose) mostly AZ, I'm concerned. 

Blood clots seem rare side effect one hopefully treated.

I'd concerned tens, even hundreds thousands dropping dead. time also worry vaccine affect people long term. wrong way position vindicated? Usually weighing millions preventable deaths side. Perpetuate amongst non vaccinated people? cares prevents spread significantly. 100 percent a
Lot TIL band named Fozzy non-issue. relatively wealthy able go anyways. There's billion Muslims world, there's enough space, poor can't afford plane tickets. Even go lifetime, that's tens millions would need go year. recall, requirement ""who able"", means poor go anyways. CDC US recommends waiting 6 weeks max get second dose. Medical information synonymous vaccination record. (You already share vaccination records go school jobs)

But thanks though, it'll make line shorter rest us. Headline be: “Vaccination effective!” know people dead fully vaccinated. crepes! worker gonna take ur job unless office""

Fucking psychopaths. *been* hiring H1-B Indians years now. Presidents control flow information more. news Facebook developing countries people simply take vaccine. sucks terms ending pandemic - everyone, everywhere. nothing anything. homophobes use phrase ""safe children"" make everything else does, including stuff physical health safety, homophobic. Rolling eyes hard rn. I'm sure I'll enforced...lol. Sinopharm vaccine distributed UAE certainly stop covid infection. entire family took two doses everyone got covid. Yes sub became echo chamber saying *all* vaccines *always* safe *all* people. course stupid follow internet strangers advice, mantra that. Shouldn’t be? venues require people wear ties. Great points people's behaviour here, personally risk still minimal (like order 1 100,000). benefit getting second jab far outweigh risks. always obvious. virus floats around air care 6 feet away. Lockdowns work. enforce strictly allow exceptions (i.e. requirement employers let people work home possible closed schools).

The major clusterfuck regional governments put together indeed completely laughable efficient maximising economic loss, limiting personal freedoms time.

The main reason US back foot successful vaccination program afaik.  Hopefully, means restrictions years, still less restrictions right now. know lockdowns sustainable long term, especially developping countries without possibility remote work. ...

So trusting UK...

Because *most* data it? Received second dose Moderna Friday 2nd. 

I know I’m technically “fully vaccinated” 16th, I’m pretty much clear now, right? Aren’t protected? Colleges definitely requiring different small business concert venue requiring vaccines. article ""vaccinated snowbirds"". argument expensive mandatory quarantine unfair vaccinated people, people?

Regardless, left country advice government country, also given clear date return Canada wanted avoid new expensive quarantine arrangements.

They multiple opportunities avoid situation, helpfully mentioned still opportunity avoid - fly border city cross land border.

There's also obvious reasons implemented air travel land travel. one elicits 90% immune response antibodies. No, means...


There 1 10,000 chance [with whatever viral load tested] pick enough virus surface able become infected it.

Not 1 10k cases surface, 1 10k surfaces contaminated.

Your surrounded boxes filled blue poker chips. Every couple feet one boxes handful red chips added. reach get red one found covid sample. 1-in-10000 chance one red ones big X it. find red one big X it, get infected. 1/3 received one shot. Even fully vaccinated prevent one contracting spreading disease, rather seriously mitigates seriousness symptoms caught.

In state, nobody 55 eligible get appointment yet. Nobody 65 yet eligible unless comorbidities.

Vaccines provide 100% protection that. build business take pride offering fair wages hours.

Good luck that, unless rich, course. need luck. share data important things, like work/school. However, idea problematic implemented like impractical key downsides.

1) Without digital IDs easy fake, thus useless.

2) digital IDs, provides government record every place been. problematic can't opt out, government run, represents major privacy concern data breached.

3) digital IDs, take least month get system secure another month get rolled out. Probably, impediment businesses unvaccinated people shut certain venues (and likely open everyone vaccinated system).

4) Elderly people able use app, adding logistical hurdles.

5) clearly divisive would add yet another rift societal discourse without providing tangible benefit simply dropping restrictions vaccinations lead low cases.

Basically, time businesses make money vaccinated, safe open society anyway. Grats advance travelled world, epi pen allergies whole life. allergies aren’t airborne. manage I’m wondering life affected physically unable take vaccines currently available reach 70/80% folks vaccinated. many ppl EU got AZ shots far..50m? 100m

Nowhere near many. *Selfish people wife's company reentry plan week already know going turn out. friends many people work social media whatever want, going bars, beaches, hanging groups boss said freaked saying wont feel safe. Almost eligible get vaccine love working home really much. feeling many quitting happens scream ""my safety"" issue gatherings going public mask. UK never didn’t acknowledge concerns, simply said benefits outweigh risks - EU first publish paper I'd find link AZ clots? started. EU mean specific branch handles vaccines, sorry can't remember names. 2 ifs agree. issue 70% enough. Israel showing *probably* is, enough demographic differences need see looks like definitively saying 70% work.

In meantime, encourage everyone know get vaccine. get it, less less likely they'll implement vaccine passports. Even link, it’s happening rarely statistically it’s close 0%. 

Something like 0.000001666666667% based 22 people getting blood clots 18.1 million. Got mine yesterday! really bad headache, felt damn cold middle night super restless. Everything headache gone.

Your mistake think temporary 1st step shit. shitty media be, entirely EMA head vaccines talking shit newspapers official capacity without regard EMA's plans announcements were. pure amateur irresponsible behaviour. 
 
You can't blame press literally told interview. Lockdowns worked China, they're country world positive GDP growth they've back normal since last summer. new Zealand. live kauai Hawaii cut tourism week last year enjoyed 0 cases island. everywhere world able this, virus transmission would become near impossible would gone. Well actually true NY literally already developing it. happening here! See there!  That’s point. government doesn’t really good track record removing emergency policies emergency over. “King Cuomo” also fearmongering. don’t actually live monarchy governor unilaterally impose requirement private businesses.

What seem afraid simply lawful United States America, you’re called fearmongering. Finally shift goalposts get behind wife’s getting ready baby. pushed get vaccine issues. ??? huh??? arm gonna toast every 6 months Truth. wonder Aaron Swartz would think many Redditors outraged government opposed requiring travel papers. Dude obviously sarcastic Wrong. 246 infected Michigan completed vaccination schedule. 4 died. would wear mask you’re outdoors car? really done large rollout AstraZeneca 40's yet. real data.

The UK given 15 million AZ vaccines, least. include healthcare workers people health conditions; plenty age 50. 
 
This bizarre narrative somehow much smaller sample size countries given less 10% amount AZ totally nonsensical.  
 
They far data countries released theirs. They're refusing so. think important epidemiological study pandemic: summary, variance COVID cases simply due population size (more people means COVID), population density, strain happened hit area. Everything else makes difference, small one.

Masks important make difference, stop wave. EU says want immunize 70 % adults end June, 100 % immunity. This..Ive already booked flights summer visit countries strict vaccine testing reqs. copied database also easily log checked alert door person duplicate entry. way presale ticket check-ins usually work.  always people write sentences like dropped middle school dumb opinions. reopened indoor dining outdoor playgrounds lakefront... talk doctor asap low grade fever days. literally copied title article lol Actually, FDA said evidence vaccine prevents transmission virus person person.

NYer here. local pharmacies actually this. local facebook group said one nears walk ins certain days clear whatever leftover doses have. go since already appointment. cool know! agree. Still, it’s important acknowledge “clear link” would mean “clear causation” cases. That’s hilarious. point lockdown never stop virus. literally prolong spread hospitals wouldn’t overwhelmed.

Since J&amp;J vax one shot I'll good couple weeks, though I'll still taking precautions accordance CDC guidelines. Everyone household vaccinated, made without infection. rough year, though obviously many others far worse. Good luck everyone. gov says lot things tbh wondering well. Based understanding, mandate prevents mandatory enrollment. Texans still ability use apps track vaccination status, cannot required so. However, likely forced use app otherwise prove vaccination status wish travel certain states countries. news, scientists rediscovered water freezes 32ﾟF. would government regulate private company salaries? NJ used May 1 pushed April 19 yesterday. I’ve fully vaccinated I’d rather avoid crowds requires vaccine passport. It’s overkill. Hopefully really won’t need vaccine continues drive rates. Booster shots probably available fall variants. would wait those. studies done (to knowledge) effectiveness two different vaccines. Yes, possible. Well within normal experiences.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, doctor basically said same. yet people still trust whatever say gospel see potentially repeat Social Security Number. SSN supposed used anything else, yet became *de facto* ID number lot things due convenience.... point SSN fraud became problem. 

So let's say document provided (or least certified by) local health department. Initially may piece paper. point, however, people going falsify paperwork allows get business. either becomes worthless, form verification set -- latter means infrastructure investment sort. 

Well, word antibodies may last year. may push everyone get COVID vaccinations several years row, prevent flaring society enduring lockdowns. case, we're looking process sticking around while, along verification system (maybe QR code that, scanned, hits local health department API simply confirms denies validity). 

Somebody get bright idea could tie children's immunizations this. county requires form certification work food prep, holder certified. bearer health-related certifications.  

Now handled *government*. something farmed corporate world? Well, may get HIPAA hurdles... waived law changed, credentials could tied it. Kroger (or local supermarket chain) authorized process these? also tie loyalty card sort, could simply put keychain? smartphone app? 

It basically comes this: need provide proof something covered existing government ID, new credential created. *entire population* needs it, simple one-offs like slip paper signature date may work. money made solution, corporations step -- extract even profit solution, they'll so. government hook provide solution, they'll go cheapest fastest fix ... kill multiple birds one stone free funds something else, they'll well.

This either collapse weight turn monster. means school reopen without children vaccinated yet, since they're huge driver cases got appointment getvaccinated, coworker became eligible yesterday got shot yesterday near Troutdale. F5'd sites hard impossible. US quickly running demand issues. US expecting another 200M mRNA vaccines delivered April-May, plus another \~40M J&amp;J vaccines. means end May enough vaccines nearly every adult US. [Polling vaccinations adults likely top \~80%, meaning time May US vaccines waiting arms. 

Given expected availability, erring side opening eligibility early right thing do. California waited long open vaccinations folks underlying health conditions, resulted [rate vaccinations administered dropping \~33% early \- opened eligibility, rate quickly doubled. US vaccine endgame - herd immunity sight. next two months, maximizing rate vaccinations become important.  


Herd immunity offers way better protection individual vaccination. Given sight, prioritized. find antibodies, following still true:
""The vaccines still seemed protect variant first found United Kingdom rapidly spreading United States elsewhere.""
which mean offer protection spreads, probably SA one. IDK enough spread SA, sinovac vaccinated populations sequenced find significant SA component?  Probably not. saying **at least** 6 months, literally that's long study was. look antibody graph, see it'll take lot longer drop meaningfully reduced number. fine least fall, would suspect variant-targeting boosters available. don’t like able use Slack reach someone wait hours response.

Y'all phones? someone taking hours reply IM they're clock, especially important, probably fired. virus tell difference? I've actually enjoying restaurants months now, think I'll continue to. Maybe done years therapy brave enough step outside again. ""So telling ability alter DNA best idea come make infertile. Got it."" Yeah cause Denmark planning everyone done mid-July UK end. sort looks like we'll finish around time, despite everything happened beginning year. people even care? difference miniscule. higher risk dying crossing road. People already replying saying it’s soon lmfao Twitter cesspool Vaccine passport fucking dumbest idea. conspiracy theorists thread gonna upset one every country, province, state, city needs.

Clear targets. Something look forward to. 

It would go long way regards compliance vaccine uptake. know long protection lasts one shot, vs both?

(I actually know either bringing question might help convince her)  Well that’s different topic. vaccine passports give people good feels? 

Yes. 

But doesn’t mean anything restrictions. don’t. 

You getting vaccination extent able feel safe. Nothing done make feel safer. Great trends California. Vaccines chugging away too. Great see kind progress. Anywhere else would better, hotels, giant medical boat, something throwing burning branch pile sticks. backwards vaccine passport makes things restrictive. frees people up.  eligibility open anyone NYC people “skipping line”? judging curious. worse 2020 it. reaching herd immunity due infections governor also responsibility constituents dying? mean, storm month ago.... can't argue irrational people. I'm sorry, sucks. Take whatever steps mental physical wellbeing. annoying again? Variants exist, even today already making vaccine less effective, become numerous people without vaccine about, people can't get vaccine number reasons. kind combination low levels platelets, blood clots bleedings case AZ ""normal"" blood clots? Yup. Alaska biggest peak November December. right. me. texts religion determine them. foundations different claim same? example, Christianity Islam share similarities. However foundations different, making two separate religions.

I respect atheism stand whoever like. whether Mormons Christian either opinion really mean anything me, especially made spite. please tone Christianity hatred man. argue religion want remaining respectful professional. Telling believe BS definitely one way express argument, constructive mean interact vaccinated people freely, worry way one vaccinated. 

These passports would make things less restrictive overall, still follow common sense. Trump correct, wow. need test bleach lysol might get Trump citation Nature article. Hallelujah Estimations 5-6 weeks ahead EU, considering way EU schedule ramping might get shorter haven’t worked places have.

No I'm sure that's relevant. Wow, Jesus christ. Lots break here. 

So I'm stupid, bad person, welcome public places.

Go ahead show specific way covid worse flu someone obese, diabetic, elderly, immunocompromised.

For second part, no, I'm going absolutely continue go things want do. I'll get fake vaccine pass to.

There's danger anyone also, choice, unvaccinated.

The outcomes 1. businesses allow unvaccinated people in, result way cases deaths, 2. Fake vaccine passes.

There's absolutely *nothing* gained banning unvaccinated people places. respect Fauci, say “NO SHIT!” You’ve become thing you’ve sworn destroy: COVID misinformation spreader. Seriously? new study? I’m pretty sure remember correctly end February last year Asian countries released data showing exactly this. went managers Amazon basically thought crazy concerned ventilation work spaces. bugged 2 weeks. Basically end told power make changes. That’s realized people really don’t care anything unless directly affects them. backwards? 

Whether people interact others depends political decision politicians. 

Once politician declares “People interact others restrictions,” people interact others. 

Vaccines vaccine passports nothing it. 

This declaration made many states already made rest end may. 

Everyone vaccines vaccine passports, yet restrictions gone nonetheless. think people underestimate impact quality life tinnitus have. kid, adult work etc would even worse. 

I would wary, hope find culprit goes way though. way it. Potentially paired vaccine percentage number want include caveat, ""We re-open %date% x% people least one dose 2 weeks date."" Helps give fence sitters reason get vaccine. case, could something like ""Cali reopen June 15 70% people least 1 dose June 1."" haven’t worked places have. 

Not show repeat shots anything titers public even started getting vaccinated yet. Public vaccinations likely start June. dumb lol definition knowing someone broad enough includes thousands college aged people, there's way would actually consider someone know well enough would come talk long term symptoms them. human jump conclusions based limited evidence? Probably, surprised people call it. really wanted secure implemented better system card easily duplicated anyone printer cardstock. miss newborn cuddles. five year old cuddle save life now. Rambunctious small man is. Follow @nycshotslots instant alerts availabilities, able book multiple appointments throughout week today. Uh. Every state already collecting information. 

Quick example, I-cares IDPH Illinois. Absolutely! We're good. :) got pfizer, arm pretty notably sore nothing insufferable. worked 8 hour shift next day, little tired/weak got someone else take shopping carts didn’t energy that, nothing couldn’t work Im hoping another couple weeks effects vaccination happen cases drop 🤞🏼 got J&amp;J yesterday, still feeling pretty sick laying bed today. Last night chills, hopefully goes away soon. Thanks one first trial it. Pfizer: Two shots three weeks apart. considered ""fully vaccinated"" CDC two weeks second shot (five weeks first shot), although actually *somewhat* protected already couple weeks first shot. 90% efficacious symptomatic COVID US, meaning provides close complete protection COVID (including severe COVID / hospitalization / death).

J&amp;J: One shot. considered ""fully vaccinated"" CDC two weeks shot, immunity COVID continue improving least four weeks shot. 70% efficacious symptomatic COVID US, 85% efficacious ""severe"" COVID, close complete protection hospitalization death.

Basically protect COVID becoming life-threatening illness, less likely get symptoms take Pfizer, tradeoff much value needing one shot vs much value protecting low-but-real chance getting moderately sick. JJ help vaccination efforts. Look exactly. Yeah -- went audiologist checked hearing. ran bunch tests said everything good ear canal clean. appointment ENT Thursday though, may tests run.

And I'm definitely open fact may something vaccine that's going on, basically like two weeks left figure appointment second dose.

It's scary. ringing impacts sleep, impacts mood, makes nauseous, makes hard focus. want fully vaccinated, fact *possible* vaccine caused enough give pause now. go wealthier north east school expensive tuition. lot people come money NYC, Long Island, Jerz, LA come here. lowkey feel like kids refusing vaccine see “poor person’s vaccine” Daddy’s money always expecting best best everything. kidney transplant I’m seriously considering study came recently showed 2 doses 70% effective transplant patients Well isn’t true. Covid several animal reservoirs, including close companions like dogs cats. 

Once you’re vaccinated, able take mask anyway. 

Hell, many places take mask without vaccination. Why? restrictions political. Agreed. interesting thing states dial systems still restrictions (typically 50% capacity mask mandates) even “lowest” tier dial. wonder threshold we’ll need cross dial restrictions scrapped altogether mother keeps trying convince Moderna vaccine gonna alter DNA make infertile. deal incessant guilting conspiracy theory bullshit? 

It’s really wearing she’s getting persistent closer appointment. basically tell I’ve done research don’t agree misinformation start it’s starting get hand I’m basically yelling leave alone!  Herd immunity hope seems odd set arbitrary date two months away ""reopening"" date. Though maybe goal deadline. Pfizer mind going back get second shot. argument always vaccination status civil liberty. said, nobody's forcing get vaccinated. seen many people take ‘safe’ road, find dead industry dead end careers. safe way learn constantly keep moving up. Make sure get paid well good times cover bad times. completely disagree, talking risk mitigation, inviting unvaccinated people countries US bad policy. ifs ands buts. would straight stupid. Perfect. midst pro cycling race, Tour Basque Country, roads lined shouting fans. Seems like locals getting message danger. He's rich named Billionaire last year included 4th July, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, ie. multiple dates lower case counts could attributed holiday, yet still lowest. Anecdotal evidence someone living Houston. Masks required places now, I'd say 90% people still wear them. Nobody really cares social distancing though. makes think cost savings them. require vaccinations ridiculous allow full person classes. side effects anyone first second doses family besides small arm pain. friend ill though. want get packed bar spread 100 closest friends. 



/s course ridiculous. four month window April 15 start semester August students get vaccinated still chose keep classes online. even announced class schedule Biden California already promised everyone get vaccinated May 1st. talking process would take years, requiring accumulation dozens, hundreds mutations.

If happens, see coming mile away, plenty time roll booster. ticking timebomb catastrophic change going make vaccines work overnight. White House rules vaccine passport thank God wrestling move weight classes create matchups much risk take get ""extra points"" win also depend team doing.  cases sending someone telling ""stall get pinned"". win wrestling 3 team points, major decision (8+ individual points win) 4 team points, tech fall (leading 15 individual points like mercy rule) 5 team points, pin 6 team points. 14 weight classes, win 5 matches pin lose 9 matches still win meet. not? would think US would reach 70% much earlier end June. backwards. covid passport would give people vaccine interact restrictions. That’s illegal planets “nearly” problem. open things back it’ll spread again. take small group spread. everyone locked would anyone immunity? live New Jersey. one vaccinated states, still among states worst situation, New York Michigan? everyone vaccine covid. could go maskless worry. CNN articles make seem hopeless situation lol Last year different way lax, they've set cautious re-opening dates i.e. non-essential activities open till 12th full opening earliest date 21st June. hope longer need lockdowns. definitely sucks missing great view, gonna lie. 

What need know coworkers look like for? Knowing staff looks like help fix printer, help make projector work, help fix email, nothing. see problem here. 

Unless work means social interaction.  80% 2 weeks first dose. Why? Go get vaccine, bam, fine. care someone else gets didn’t want vaccine. Moved goalposts what? understand comment. mean, ain't gonna wait vaccines kids sending back school. 12s, could good ways off.

I'll take long term risks COVID long term risks another semester classroom. trial participant J&amp;J *just* 6 month visit. articles saying ""at least"". go get blood drawn analyzed (and COVID tested 6 months J&amp;J) release findings everything looking. point, dragging trial participants every month (I'm scheduled next Nov) expect see another update soon. People bad understanding words  mean [like keep personally may want measures made permanent look back, you’ll see there’s authoritarian types want force it. allow vaccine passports become thing, they’ll push that, too. US, getting relevance. doesn’t contradict OP link ""As long keep vaccinating people efficiently effectively, think that's gonna happen,"" Fauci said fourth wave appearance MSNBC's Morning Joe. ""That mean we're going still see increase Fauci said ""remain seen"" uptick cases ""explode real surge"" states reopen economies relax public health ""I think vaccine gonna prevent happening,"" said.

That’s literally word “may” means OP headline. 

**shrug* Huh almost like lock downs mask mandates don’t work... would thought. Enjoy living creepy two-tiered society. I'll chill normal places, instead.  mean they'll lift requirements capacity/social distancing? Holy shit. California likely last one open. People lying said done summer. Oh sure. I'm fortunate job lot flexibility choice came scheduling appointment. finally got waiting list, told Sunday appointment Wednesday 10:15am center I'd never heard of- take leave next 5 minutes go next line. I'm happy worked me, that's reasonable doable lot people. crazy, hopefully pressure reality next couple months help change mind. employee works geographic area city suitable. I’m talking salaried workers collaborate daily, retail factory workers tasks. Chicago's metro 70% states population, basically state. Michigan 25.2% people vaccinated, NY 28.1 NJ 28.3%. NJ significantly vaccinated states still enough unvaccinated people cases surge (albeit smaller surges would otherwise have). even people angry restrictions go far enough... talking specific professional situations?

We're discussing mundane activities going bar. course work healthcare institution something. Vaccine passports currently used Israel true. lol huh? playing team politics way hard. thought less factor cuz 'open air' know would help, actually research data pregnancy vaccination.

""TL;DR: Yes people phase 3 trial got pregnant vaccination. difference rates pregnancy vaccine placebo groups. one vaccine group trouble pregnancy course study. also tested female rats find problems, either fertility pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report give nice summary like this, report 23 people became pregnant trial. report 2 adverse events related pregnancy, placebo group.

Both companies say continue monitor pregnant people. general, know reason vaccine would affect fertility. believe ever before. mRNA technology new-ish, radically different would reason believe fertility would affected. hand, growing evidence covid-19 affect Trust me, schools hemorrhaging money want nothing get everyone (students, faculty, staff, researchers, etc.) back campus full time. think conservative, leaves plenty time people get vaccinated.  That's good point. little bit read CDC website, study covered 13 weeks immunization. Within 13 weeks, partial immunization 80% efficacy, full immunization 90%. perfectly logical diseases deadly others spread easier children might required might not. say like happy.

Oh happy saw beginning downsides go full WFH everyone downvoted thought greatest thing ever happen professional world would future.

Now lot people understand great thing. I’m blaming nothing people supporting policies caused this.

Not mention that's hour life save every day. spending lot coffee offset eating home. Well educated people Upper West Side tend computer literate, frankly, probably want vaccine someone dropped high school lives worse neighborhood. 

There still plenty opportunities places everyone get shot, even Bronx. strawman. red herring. I’m CSULB classes within college liberal arts math department online fall. natural sciences art departments offer in-person classes classes online unless critical in-person component needed specific class. seem way? pretty conservative estimate? pretty optimistic vaccine distribution keeps ramping up? there's one silver lining COVID-19, pandemic proven many jobs done remotely.

More companies realise need huge office space set back tens, even hundreds thousands year. workplace previously office based majority staff remote workers serving small part workforce. quickly adapted since little workforce actually enter office.

This good thing. inner city office blocks converted apartments, better. Many cities already facing housing shortages need something increase supply. COVID could it. soon unlimited supply astra Zeneca america doesn’t want it. problem Canadians don’t want much either propaganda. Yes blood clots vaccines like Pfizer side effects much higher rate. conspiracy theory one vaccine company’s may paying media/governments ban astra Zeneca *can't. falls pretty clearly 10th Amendment. try. Yes, infectious diseases work. population less infection, everyone lower chance catching it. seriousness passport overplayed ban se sensationalist. It’s tool used business open safely. Like said, okay disagree fundamentals. cool dude, get vaccinated live life. Stay healthy It’s even worse job won’t let take time off, you’re disabled traveling strenuous, live somewhere even Uber hard come by.

I going start saying uniroincallhy Literally look top comment thread. discussion propoganda. Yeah know one 60 would willing take AZ even still allowed.

Including myself. don’t protection least 8 days first shot, ramps 80% day 14, take full precautions then. Let throw around numbers here, janky back napkin math take overly seriously. 

The U.S population 328,200,000. total population 254,000,000 age 18. Let's assume 70% people 18 get vaccinated. would mean 54% total US population willing able vaccinate. 

That leaves us 56% population either young vaccinate unwilling so. Let's assume 10% infected COVID-19 developed antibodies. That's another 15 million people. 

So total, 70% people 18 take vaccine assume 10% unwilling unable take vaccine infected, total comes 58% immunity vaccine COVID exposure. 

Will 58% people enough end pandemic via herd immunity? That's hard say. modeling suggests based highly effective vaccines are. Additionally, Israel provided compelling real world phase IV data suggest 58% highly effective barrier spreading virus.

I'm guessing 18 crowd starts getting vaccinated large level, continue see outbreaks vaccine hesitant areas country. 

One last note, estimates include people 16 17 years old make broad assumption 10% overall population infected COVID-19 natural antibodies. Playing around variables could shift 58% number quite bit. Wow state sucks. I'm 37 pfizer shots body. would care effort vaccinate poor countries.

Cuba known sending doctors help patients poor countries. famous program. ""Nah, I'm already infertile vasectomy got years ago. think wanted know.""  jumps animals, likely mutate become efficient infecting animals, less effective infecting humans.

That’s used produce vaccines. stick infectious disease bunch eggs, see ones successful, repeat using starting point next batch eggs. repeat many times. virus evolves infect eggs, end, virus evolved away infecting humans used vaccinate humans allowing immune system fight much less danger version disease. called attenuated vaccines.

If disease jumps humans animal, trend towards becoming attenuated towards animal, less harmful humans.

Also, it’s much less likely become widespread mutate animal population (in general) don’t travel much, live dense populations, humans do. it’s animal population, develop another vaccine population much easily. Unpopular reddit, eager go back office. terrible self-discipline working home requires gotten better 13 months. live 20 minute walk office (or 8 minute bus ride), enjoyable commute. like able talk coworkers face face issues arise separate areas work work. miss work happy hours lunches free office coffee. think everyone dragged kicking screaming back office, think acting like insane people want return office bit weird. either naive much cut world whole don’t understand higher rates community spread come interactions. Find single post say something good China. ""China wants pandemic end"" pro-China propoganda. fact. started pandemic want over, people go back work go back buying cheap Chinese junk.

Let clear position:

1) China started pandemic

2) China's economy fueled rest world buying consumer products

3) Therefore helps China world economy start back up

4) Therefore China wants pandemic end

5) China's vaccines obviously inferior Pfizer/Moderna 

6) However, given points 2-4, China still happy hear Moderna great vaccine

None pro-China. 

There obviously hundreds pro-CCP accounts site lose credibility see single post China directly bashing call plant. Use bit reasoning. Sure. think US anything power stop Cubans vaccinated nice bridge sell you. Oh hey, remember you! Sorry hear feeling well though. Hopefully side effects pass quickly. Take care, best wishes family. Well Japan pretty universal buy mask usage case death rate incredibly low. friends Japan tell country pretty much fully open since last summer minor changes like work home. Life essentially back normal long time. say case rate underreported get Olympics could true overall cause mortality rate decreased 2020 compared 2019. could also case Japanese people general healthier Americans. average Japanese person walks miles day every day, obese, eats lot seafood vegetables less sugar. reality could ton unreported asymptomatic cases.

No one really knows sure perhaps masks get politicized could tried thing US. Maybe would worked, maybe might alternative could less damage economy still help keep deaths lower.

Even EUA FDA approval? kind precedent trying set? Thank you. God damn.... Took long find comment wears right.  Utter silliness. It’s progressives passive aggressively sticking anti-maskers.

Hopefully Fauci and/or CDC explicitly drop masking recommendations vaccinated folks get June. thats states current mask mandate says, Main reason variants still take kill you, highly transmissible contagious long period time.

The reason viruses get less deadly time deadlier versions ""burn out"" sense kill spread anyone else.

In case, contagious getting sick. would bother getting vaccinated Newsom going tell everyone state wear mask rest lives? miraculously got husband scheduled vaccines tomorrow 28th. cannot tell thrilled am. Per New York Times, state won’t currently meet universal eligibility deadline Hawaii, set May 1. states-- believe Oregon one-- bumped timeline. really one state “contend” with, point. 

As *how* U.S. able meet vaccine eligibility, others thread discussed (TL;DR, high supply and, states, low demand). stop wiping groceries?! Yippee!!!! Yea, Internet hard place navigate days much disinformation. 

It’s bit complicated “8 months,” read full article here:  wish could ban morons office long full efficiency vaccine second shot pfizer? googled says takes 14 days thought like 5-10 youre good?   see reason Easter Sunday would significantly lower Sunday Jan 2, Sunday 12/27, etc. True, trend itself, still excellent news. Deaths dropped 75% since peaks January. expect continue dropping vaccinations. Offset people increasing risky behavior, still celebrate progress, make plans opening back truly less risky. feels like cynical bet Newsom win recall election.

According table, total number tests 40 million 83 thousand 142, total number severe patients 2 thousand 477, total number recovered 3 million 159 thousand 475, number tests today 271 thousand 547."" Okay, champ. 100% correct. NY entire US. 

I sharing experience illustrating that, places (in big 'ole US A), check ID birth date order get vaccinated.

That response comment, reason denied experience another person got vaccinated NY (coped NY, people make appointments using name show photo ID personalized ticket enter vax venue.  Nope. Maryland first last name date birth checked ID. one looked paperwork wife. Almost easy voting (no date birth voting).

I tell trying make point (maybe venues requiring proof vaccination tough time it?) place responding me, point hard understand getting at. Next up, 20-50 age range. celebrate good news. 7 Day death average still slowly decreasing approaching best numbers we've seen long time. Let's celebrate that. 

Using single day death numbers, especially holiday, silly people going keep pointing out. Overall way better spot winter fantastic. 

When people freak one day high death number ill say thing. Look 7 day average trend. get distracted outliers, especially weekends holidays. Even link, chances serious reaction seem small. You’d greater chance dying food poisoning restaurant. saw ad thing California. ""Save money, spend Napa"" need passport digitally linked social security something government business verify person indeed vaccinated. lots fake vaccine passports. Maybe make misdemeanor felony (I like idea felony) enter business public space without vaccine passport. Remember, virus took lives 500k Americans cannot take lightly. opinion it’s big risk allow anti vax people live society. I’d favor re-education programs anyone vaccine passports. Think like certification govt creates little towns anti vax/passport people live learn vaccines social safety.

Edit: vaccine virus never got flu everyone around natural immunity vaccinated? (i never got flu vaccine)

Either way nice see covid 19 going path eventually feel like exist go back normal lives. two weeks ago. sore shoulder. went grocery shopping afterwards. went home used jump rope day day after.

But yet parents complained fevers stuff. don’t think ever go cruise ship. Millions millions people natural immunity catching virus well. push narrative evidence-based combat damage media done. Huh. opposite experience youth hockey. School distance first 6-7 weeks hockey season would sporadic positive case there. School starts 3 weeks that, 5 teams quarantine multiple positive cases. 

Our hockey association strict masks, time spent rink, pod size contact tracing positive case. middle schooler says half kids school even wear masks county back higher case load active cases statewide school shutdown October. 

I think it’s easier contact trace sports data suggests finding. Intact tracing middle high school much complicated.  public health policies place, required masking

So Newsom wants masks thing rest lives? vaccine passport debacle similar disable placards autos not. Rarely, unless dick, anyone ask disability. either present display merry way. imagine prior placards used, constant one uping eachothers disabity. That's great hear 👍 need comparison, Let’s use topic hand.

That's vaccine passports proposing want protect dosage numbers prevent fakes. want official app businesses scan. Bounty Hunter! Born bayou. say hellspawn prostitute whore!

I trying clarify logic it. everything ideological fight ya know?

Especially already much information sort through. sad small man.

I pity you. Yep walking allowed, pubs, places eat, stay night etc open I'm sure numbers great, can't stand soft words like hard data behind it. Declining means little dates comparison even means numbers overall percentage hospitalizations. 

How ""x% hospitalizations 65+ beginning December, y%""

On similar note easy is, CDC showing COVID cases nursing homes 98% since peaking week Christmas. r/neutralnews Probably lower immunity higher variant counts. states relaxed restrictions somewhat. dunno got *something* little month ago left 102F fever crippled bed three days despite barely going anywhere. COVID-19 negative knows whatever was. state still demand copy insurance card get shot. I'm sure gives many people impression they'll charged. ask insurance make appointment too. slightly even, good news. US whole looks also trending week ago. I'm LA supposedly one in-demand areas vaccines friends least one dose despite many us technically eligible. There's many clinics giving doses either 1) anyone local community 2) anyone many doses.

Dodger Stadium supposedly mostly empty days I've seen lot people Twitter encouraging everyone make appointment go. one cares ""line jumping"" anymore open everyone week anyway appts sitting empty, take point. probably added distance learning fee US Canada hit big vaccine producers really good purchase orders. EU bet vaccines put orders quickly, AZ boondoggle helped them. They'll get ahead soon. yea, like what’s damn reason there’s vaccine literally anyone? Keep things shut dont wanna take it? Fuck that. Disagree. People vaccines need even cautious spread without showing symptoms sick. Double masks required everyone vaccinated, per Fauci, perpetuity, Covid completely over.

This attitude privileged health astounds me. people can't get vaccinated. must cautious them. Masks comparable example person replying shirts shoes. Yeah, don’t think that’s accurate, link? cant track something pretend gone UK (and US) absolutely life next years. Every adult opportunity get vaccinated fall sooner. supply labor thing.

I beg differ, want job think fit right Downing Street! cost benefit analysis anything whether things fully open. 

It sure does. consider certain reasonable restrictions still ""fully open"". always have. fact, that's point. Nonresponsive. 

You certainly are. Yeah, ignored that, dumb point. 

You ignored demolishes argument. counter it. vaccine passport is. possible test approved vaccines instead placebo.

But new vaccine coming market now, advantages existing vaccines going glut end year next year latest. That’s crazy talk. like going getting vaccine meant 100% chance getting COVID? wouldn’t worry. Israel saw thing several news reports people sub saying vaccines werent working cases kept going up.

Then went down. ceiling falling number people reasonably get infected. crazy rate. Probably within couple weeks going literally impossible virus surge anywhere close past. 

As long rate vaccination outpaces virus multiple 30 (the national minimum average) this'll continue happening. Amen! real president Let’s say “dangerous infections” then. 

I think problem overly optimistic beginning this, people won’t trust “return normal” change unless we’re delivering promises instead missing targets. We're foot race accelerating vaccine rollout public health malfeasance millions Americans politicians elected. 

What issue anti-vaxxers remain everyone wants vaccine gets it. advocated carrot stick necessary approach. I.E. give employees days incentives get two jabs. that, remainder risk losing employment. Students whose parents refuse shots would need barred school. 

And abolish ""religious exemption"" loop hole. Nobody religious exemption allows put lives others risk. I’m sure open June, provided vaccine rollout continues current success. Thanks. know that. hope better luck J&amp;J. Ugh... yeah CDC never going recommend them.

I think hope remove private sectors starts first. Like Target grocery stores stop requiring it. employers stop requiring offices, think snowball effect like rollout them.

It’s pretty amazing see hierarchy office dissipate. Politics seems less issue well. work culture home life instead office culture work contribution company goals instead spend time.

Working home done wonders equality well. Sexism doesn’t feel like much thing (except insufferable old guard types can’t figure shit out). longer “a body office”, “a mind team.” Gender matters less. imagine people differently abled great way level playing field well.

I may huge jerk saying someone can’t basic office work, maybe it’s time step aside let someone can, position? Support staff much valuable basic typing calls.

I hope stay remote!  Yeah that’s it’s near too. Anyone could basically say they’re smoker eligible. friends don’t blame them, going rural areas demand low plenty available doses. Better go use sit around unused. Remind me! 10 years ""see wrong guy was"" Sure, mean use crisis covid MANDATE post covid. Want wear mask, guest. hope normalized want to, forcing others post covid issue people OK with. Yes, mainly unvaccinated people. passports would allow vaccinated people return normal life without restrictions. hold glass hand. problem solved. Yeah remember two day lag. honestly it’s expected Easter Day! gruesome say, people already died preventable ailments years fear medicine. understand that. it’ll follow suit. feel sorry french people say thanks France given us proof curfews work.. curfew 18:00 6:00 two months, become Brazil Western Europe. new drug??? someone tell happened daily vaccination progress stats posts sub? whole reason would come gone multiple days :( miss travelling??? realize countries low covid case count...pretty much safe get. That’s good aware of! wipe ass sink toilet seat since can't catch covid that! mean thats fine, want go office room feel secluded go in, let home lmao. spoke ~30 year old guy thought get shot insurance, fearing afford pocket. made sure tell completely free.

Most people browse /r/coronavirus may dark comes information. Eh, either way. family members histories clots laughing matter I’m glad ended getting shots. didn’t intentionally avoid AZ that’s worked out. People overestimate importance preventing fraud situations like these. rules, people follow them. people want commit fraud risk consequences. case, small number people commit fraud show places without vaccines, risk areas still greatly reduced goal herd immunity still reached. Perfection necessary.

If think vaccine passports non idea, perhaps let us know whether think longstanding requirements vaccinations schools international travel also go. Good solution see people filling regular seats. Indiana’s cases half Ohio, makes sense. Kentucky probably won’t much longer. Still better dying covid lived state Illinois, people idiots realities people money are. Private entities may choose use it. 

No govt mandates. *Buy facemask hand sanitizer...*

*And never look back!* one changing argument. I'm merely pointing differences things supplied others aren't.

I also state providing certain information going provide avenue business discriminate someone. Given minorities less likely vaccinated I'd rather avoid awkward confrontations employees customers. one saying going wearing mask rest life. Go get vaccine we'll done sooner. ok question last even year protection still gonna get sick ? mean know like know others think vary 10%-30% infected patients describing long term issues

Is 10%-30% infections cases? makes huge difference.

Cases usually unfortunate folks worst symptoms end getting tested hospital.

Most infected people asymptomatic mild facet pandemic come calculations? 

The change long term complications due covid is:

(Chance re-infection) × (chance severe symptoms) × (change symptoms causing permanent damage)

For example, events 20% chance occurring:

~20% × ~20% × ~20% = 0.8%

It's probably order magnitude less that, people die long term complications compounding factors.

In honestly, know odds happening, order 0.05% 0.15% reasonable estimate risk assessment real threat long Covid/persistent decreased respiratory function decimates quality life worse death certainly worse potential side effects mRNA vaccine admission isn’t evidence for.

Yeah, that's fair. Get vaccine. hope shown reasonably safe.

I figure 95% chance fine.

It's still risk-benefit thing.

For people 30s, covid-19 [infection fatality rate less 1 4000. consider negligible threat, think I'm crazy irrational that.

(Edit. Also, subreddit prevents commenting often. I'm trying respond told wait 10 minutes. stupid pointless limitation.) like you, you’re funny! huge brainer get shot. people like wearing shirts pool. points. mask doesn’t hinder ability see movie hear music. Isolate roommate best can. Get tested getting second dose. covid-free, get dose. COVID, delay dose 6 week interval.  fair, UC alma mater moving online courses lower div math classes long pandemic.  why? WTF there? national covid map county looks like cut thumb bleeding over. Unfortunately, late right way. Trump would planned happen. possible. would take would CDC printed hundred million vaccine cards individual QR code one. Vaccinators could scan card enter name scan ID computer. keep card, would linked name scannable anywhere. Even systems broke enter information computer, still individual vaccine card could get name system later on.

I know can't now, vaccination already started. still approximate it, albeit increased ability fraud -- fraud probably going tiny factor anyway. 

It's important recognize difficult technical problem. could done, government time simply desire competency carry out. Total hysteria Vaccinating people likely create evolutionary pressure vaccine resistant strains. remains seen whether COVID climb mountain - possible steep.  


Vaccine manufacturers something smart targeting spike protein virus. That's protein virus uses gain entry cells - like lockpick. virus mutates spike protein much evade immune system, liable also impair ability infect cells.  


We'll see plays practice, theory quite comforting. goodness. seem nice! would think want results around timeframe. I'm privy info can't sure. Even though saying masks still thing, take least sign things improving next months. Something tells mask thing drop June 15th actually comes around. think gaslighting bad now, 2 months comments kinds articles ""well yes course vaccine perfect still get sick... LOOK less likely die! ALSO LONG COVID EXIST!"" Felicitatie &amp; Welkom! 55% fully vaccinated (and probably 65% first dose) pretty damn close herd immunity, though. also recall lifetime last time pandemic killed 550,000 people United States 2.8 million people worldwide (that know of, number higher). think perception driven public perception, actual precautions taken last year fairly uniform across US least. certain amount average American would sacrifice, driven based perceived risk, minorly impacted government actions. I'm US trust CDC data given newest tested variants circulating here. Feel free trust UK Israel data prefer obviously. Yet always people talking always need person two jobs four kids takes care elderly father.

This almost certainly incorrect. CDC found 80% efficacy first shot, much larger study UK found 72% efficacy first shot, larger still study Israel found 66% efficacy. I'm CA know many people least one shot. Every family member coworkers it. Two months lockdown seems bit much. Yes, tennis wrestling team sports.

For example, tennis competition 2 high schools features 5 matches (3 singles 2 doubles).

Best wait week two symptoms clear. hate family, love time away them. Work separate home miss office work home. walk fine.

I wouldn’t take edible, though. develop fever/fatigue vaccine, hangover dry mouth make feel way worse. wait tomorrow next weekend. fact investing scares me: like intend masks long term... cant herd immunity anti-vaxers/vaccine hesitancy exists fact kids 16 havent gotten vaxxed yet. herd immunity isnt something ""plenty of"" all, either dont impossible may 15th forgot add /s know honest answer. theories endemic coronaviruses cause common cold pandemics caused much severe disease everybody catches early childhood infection mild subsequent infections much mild people that's possibility though something think enough information treat certainty. Alternatively, virus could change evolutionarily favorable so. DONE?! People immune-supressing drugs can't benefit vaccine. risk people willfully choose get vaccinated. Stop saying fully reopen indefinite mask mandates remaining place.  normally songs stuck head lol Yeah talking friend bit ago talking think things gonna normal least another year cause variants im thinking like ""uh what""  Ughh one saying masks forever. likely masks first couple weeks fully reopening proves surge cases drop masks. 

Also, already walk park without mask visit spend time vaccinated friends without mask on. restrictions getting less less week. exact opposite people Reddit seems. see lot posts people say quit job ever commute again. would quit job told WFH going permanent. guy's true piece shit vaccinated. fine. Go live life. kids fine case rates don’t factor decision making all, number vaccines actually administered.

 care hospitalizations vaccinated adults, naked disregard unvaccinated children. wearing mask works stop spread viruses. maybe anti-masker think basic science isnt true problem one want fix ventilation costs lots money. Seasonal flu spreads way covid. Aerosol, droplets. want boo person  That’s Pritzker gives us goals, meet them, changes get there.

Which circles back around people vaccinated inside certain places . Never never Guardian in-depth summary this, part rolling daily news coverage link would right.

Edit add: number highest since April 20th, 2020. army assholes continues much threat entire world NYT predicts we'll herd immunity June 15. Nobody's going listen mask mandates point even try keep around. I've worn masks religiously since quarantine put place, get vaccine 70-90% country it, fuck ""extreme precaution"" sound like intern.  Progress virus stalled... sure.

What, 108 million people vaccinated vanish thin air? issue scannable code ap medical data, rest movement information handing them.

You scan suddenly system knows exactly places scanned at, time, long stayed, part digital wallet it'll probably know else purchased said payment aps phone.

I'm worried medical data, much money medical data, I'm worried every piece data it'll collect.  Cause live house 5 roommates sometimes nice commute. walk train station, train etc, downtown restaurants go friends coworkers work nearby etc. im sitting room day feel connection shit lmao think they're referring fact despite months continually plummeting cases, hospitalisations deaths, we've vaccinated 60% adult population, including almost vulnerable people, elderly people healthcare workers, government still *very* negative press conferences opening removing restrictions.

For successful vaccine rollout think they'd celebrating quite opposite - downbeat suggestions restrictions remaining *years*. get business, restaurant, bar, stadium, venue, etc full capacity, earth matter wear mask? It’s literally easiest thing do. Mask mandates last thing remove full “normalcy”. see sides virus , yes seems desperate call .I'm sure mutated multiple times since first human interaction viruses do.to call double mutated seems like scare tactic . fully expect start wearing HAZMAT suit bubble suit going forward well. Masks aren’t 100% effective, suit up.  chose J J like idea one shot. Got Friday still feel quite un-nauseus.... again! understood dynamic sense, literally. many states? Yeah, see that. But, I’m sure Newsom. That's reassuring. Thanks! complaining privacy issues sharing ""medical records.""

But yes, separate point, unvaccinated restricted society much possible.  many collateral benefits too.  collective IQ would increase substantially. “Oh no, public loosing trust institutions” -German politicians run hallways?!? anyone explain UK's vaccination supply problems, heard supply decreasing considerably weeks, what's going on? Got 9 hours, so, ago. Arm sore first injection (same arm) feel bit sluggish, that, good far! indeed. shame everyone else too. better people grown  agree they're pieces clothing, correct?

No, impediments main purpose business, serve public health benefit. words, detriment far, far larger benefit zero.  

But want take account, relevance point.

No, point. really point. fit argument want ignore it. basically conceded point restrictions make society ""fully open"" we're arguing line is.

I nothing sort. asked think business ""fully open"" check ID's. so, according something like Bars movie theaters showing R rated films never ""fully open"" first place, pre-pandemic. disgree strongly that. authorized US efficacy high pfizer.

He's calling ""common-sense public health policies.""

I'm asking mask mandates lifted right now. I'm even much asking date. I'm asking officials agree they'll lifted point, maybe set criteria point be. quarantine upon arrival flying CA state right now? keep regularly hearing countries pausing use AZ vaccine due fears causes bloodclots... followed assurances zero evidence AZ vaccine causes bloodclots? Tough shit, anti-vaxxers. countries already requiring proof vaccination *or proof negative test* enter: proof negative test rare entirely wholesome comment, much welcomed! take domestic trip lol. think got ""common"" conflated ""required"" seem focusing getting everyone fully vaccinated rather partially, guess so. timetable sort implies they're going done vaccinating everyone 16 mid-July. quickly replying phone apparently aneurysm.

Supply issues due delayed signing procurement contracts last year. Roll-out overly bureaucratic focused vaccinating ""qualified "" individuals instead getting shots arms. problem Walcott always tries walk in. incredibly easy make forge proof within reason.

Sure, agree they're pieces clothing, correct? we're arguing pieces clothing prohibit considering something ""fully 2) also matter public health, unlike those. like requirements shoes restaurant, like examples.

Zero relevance point. one disputes masks required public health reason, restrictions. That's point. Nothing's fully open public health 3) ignored said, like ID's bar. make bar ""fully open""?

Now basically conceded point restrictions make society ""fully open"" we're arguing line is. Lots theories there. UK variant one; restrictions relaxed somewhat March another; high school sports another; pandemic fatigue another. We'll find eventually. 

Here comment researcher article posted five states fueling much US cases: 

 Researcher Joshua Schwab University California Berkeley recently estimated doubling current vaccine allocation Michigan two weeks could reduce hospitalization admissions 10,000 deaths 1,200 July. concluded far greater reductions could achieved extra vaccines combined restrictions put back place. ignorant thick headed reason? hell ever said wear mask ""the rest life""? Jesus Christ 1 year. weak can't stand tiny bit inconvenience wearing mask causes little longer? Stop fragile. get infected takes 3-15 days show symptoms, show symptoms may take people couple days get test another couple days results test reported. right. 
NYT PR CCP, usual. think idea things like concerts potentially requiring vaccine passport bothers people. want travel another country mind vaccination requirement concert venue tried get prove got year's flu vaccine attend show would find somewhat outrageous. Digital passports thing least 5+ years now. Hell iPhones come support box them.

lol canada's worthless governments. think want wear mask, go right ahead, think that's fine dandy.

But requiring one bridge far me, hit ~50% vaccination. advocating permanent mask requirement? One directional Einstein, get deaths day average COVID, put strokes unintentional injuries. 

Deaths decline spring fall due vaccinations warmer weather. finish 40 percent country brainwashed stupid get vaccine. USA worst vaccination response worst pandemic response first world nation. read Newsom plans transition away tier system June 15th, still wants mask mandates. part seem indefinite unfortunately. dry wit practically British already They're setting narrative becomes obvious vaccines useless, continue lockdown mask theatrics. Received Pfizer shot days ago symptoms, don’t even know it’s working.  ELI5: europe struggling vaccinations? Yeah definitely think it’s improving.

However last time got incredibly swollen pretty scary. Luckily breathing affected knows next time.

But guess good know still get shot. Early on, advice potentially wait another kind J&amp;J awhile AZ given 55. article says second dose huge boost immune response. Here’s two-dose vaccine regimen also produces 10 times amount neutralizing antibodies, play important role fighting virus, first second dose, Offit told CNBC.”

10 times antibodies joke. Genuine question: logic, wouldn’t 3 better 2? (I advocating 3 course isn’t logically work)? thats awesome.  Oh stop altruistic crap.  subreddit built basis science denial.  Many people disagree don't. we're dealing disease easily spread unwillingly, public duty vaccinated. give shit want personal freedoms MURICA', personal freedoms stop personal unwittingly kill someone else. say nothing mutations. Good luck getting shot everyone becomes eligible once. schedule mine 2 weeks advance slots ran quick, yet place packed tightly you’d think missed point getting immunized. right expanded include educators. TBH sounds like good number me. Canada somewhere around 70% population says willing get vaccinated, 77% GenZ Millenials going get vaccinated that's still higher general population.

You **never** going get entire population agree something. could poll entire population question ""Does shit taste bad?"" get 100% yes answer. lol People risk dying car crash hundreds times vs AZ bloodclots, see anybody restricting driving way. commenter, basically without closing school there's positive test, basically letting virus run rampant there. testing daily, tests take three days, thus allowing positive person infect others. article also says children large factor spreading virus, fact one main factors spread B117 variant. real Covid death toll worldwide?

Hopefully far 6 months know far. Yeah lots buff healthy football player types also qualify-which true. BMI isn’t best metric it’s something overweight really higher risk go get one ASAP Poor people even worst carrying vaccine passports carrying IDs voting booths second class citizens.

Poor people natural distrust modern medicine treated like pariahs, cementing view white/wealthy society.

It violates many people's sense trust, polarizing, even reddit. force something that's polarizing benefits vanishingly small?

I could go on, I'm done conversation neither us budging. force people get vaccine employers schools like every vaccine. clearly works bother polarizing invasive measure? hand data one dose (prior second doses given) shows mRNA vaccines better non-mRNA two-dose regimen novavax - far better J&amp;J we're inexplicably happy giving single dose. 

From analytics perspective giving two people one dose nearly twice good giving one person two doses. social downsides make hard actually monolithic countries. Australia plans give AZ people age 50. damn reason open schools year nearly over. Dumbest thing do. That's poor presentation paper talking about, single papers ever presented cold hard facts. weird.

Pfizer Biontech already facilities EU, made sense produce here. Also due economies scale probably cost-effective fewer larger factories concentrated single area smaller ones around world.

I think, would better place now, EU restricted exports. producers would invested ramping production lines elsewhere (and correspondingly less EU), especially since countries willing pay more. countries (most notably UK) probably would reacted counter measures, might hamstrung EU production considering Pfizer/Biontech depends components (lipid nanoparticles) produced UK. Could highly-contagious variant driving increased rates yet reach certain places? Ten years older still fairly healthy around-- side effects first dose moderna similar started around 2 hours shot. Good news \~24-hour mark next day completely gone! heard Texas governor already blaming higher numbers. repeating I've read loony Americans. Except danger virus mutating among them.   That's super odd, since Kenneth Copeland *DEMANDED* God deliver vaccine Good question, considering COVID variant(?) SARS virus. layman opinion is, vaccines one way another instruct body produce anti bodies cells.

In basic theory, long vaccine cause enough chaos generate enough surely relatively effective (or ineffective) together? That's true, deaths could stop dropping even come little bit week two. time little different since elderly high-risk people mostly vaccinated. heard bit UK variant little deadlier younger people, think outweigh decrease deaths nursing homes we're seeing vaccinations. I'm doctor though, speculate much! got second one Saturday, bunch drinks family after. Felt perfectly fine. nature epidemiological spread. Texas hit cluster cases next week, new case count climb exponentially fast weeks later without behavior changes. Texas simply ""seeded"" recently. Back spring 2020, Texas great MI getting hammered.  months later, opposite true. messaging young people needs be, sure, probably going survive, even mild cases incur symptoms long COVID. want 18 playing football, way scholarship, COVID renders unable run without losing ability breathe six months fact? real scenarios talked enough.

Death risk COVID. That's everybody left state really. large enough percentage population, virus able spread possibly incur variations. Whether ends making significant impact anybody's guess, I'd rather position take gamble. 

The messaging young people needs be, sure, probably going survive, even mild cases incur symptoms long COVID. want 18 playing football, way scholarship, COVID renders unable run without losing ability breathe six months fact? real scenarios talked enough.

Death risk COVID. they'll keep dying. Fuck them. also probably guess 2nd likely group flat getting vaccinated  answer question: fever.

Fever, along symptoms common diseases first response line foreign objects. immune system executes specific mission plan find object known threat. no, immune system work antibodies counter intruder, symptoms like fever, vomiting weakness try basically get out, burn provide enrgy fight. antibodies finished, sickness part information intruder saved together information build antibodies (although people uncertain info actually stored).

When bad guy comes back again, antibodies built little fever, vomiting etc.

The antibodies present fight therefor indication immunity. Rather ability quickly rebuild correct antibodies provoked immunity is. wanted point comment. freaking thinking I’d reaction(had covid June). mild fatigue second shot, that’s it.  mandatory religious duty many many Muslims never able do.

Some countries savings plans designed help afford it. lottery system nation gets cap many pilgrims send. Many countries require reach certain age considered.

At around 5 million year attending 1.5 billion Muslims, plus wealthy nations getting access see necessarily immediate incentive. Got second dose today I’m hurting. first one caused basically sleep 7 hours, become alert half hour, suddenly sleep 7 more... days. weird.

I’m starting get fatigue faster, despite prescribed stimulants high doses.

Oddly enough, colleague noticed second shot hurt lot first injection. Arm definitely sore right now. state run site volunteered at, asked person allergies. Specifically needed know allergies caused sort anaphylaxis reaction. so, put different line made people wait 30 minutes shot.  People didn’t fit category waited 15 minutes.  

Whatever have, make sure tell them. unlikely, first dose pretty effective body, definitely monitor symptoms extra cautious around others go PSA: surveys represent accurate canvassing people dumb/lonely/bored enough take survey. ""TWINDEMIC!!!!"" cried back August. media really wanted positively encourage young get it, would said 77% likely get vaccine. 77% least effected group wanting get actually really really good start. 77% actually indicates young actually care- oh that’s media wants focus on. 

Just another awful title encourages one group people hate another group people. That’s get clicks day. necessarily since outbreak happens ship likely end ship quarantined nobody allowed ship two weeks.

Maybe 10% adults cannot get (one needs 55 BMI &lt; 25 smoke long list pretty common conditions basically unemployed).

Besides, nobody checks already. went Newark mass site Saturday checked passport. it. Yes, interviewing they're encouraging people get vaccinated painting them—and white people—in negative light, got it. decent news brought here, really...as almost quarter Gen Z / Millennials take vaccine? Lol. Maybe explain subject thread great news instead jumping back reminding people early covid victory dance. [Statement Mayor Dave thanks School words blame well.

Well neighbor married, husband catches you...  appear effective, speculated be. likely less effective still good. basically zero threat CDC still require fully vaccinated people wear masks? CDC allows travel without quarantine still recommends people it. extremely safe advising things. would say whatever want. US position give fully vaccinated people freedom all. vase majority elderly fully vaccinated chance spread virus everything would fine. Canada significant amount 60+ even given 1 shot yet can't yet. I'm saying never yet. one said anything covid going away, talking pandemic current situation.

But I'm sure get either. I've never even started. really go anywhere anything. wash meals bathroom, ever bothered add extra washing going shopping touching stuff.  Technically depends moving, short answer yes. Many places, especially pharmacies, allow schedule independent 2nd dose. make sure keep vaccine card. survey find real number would seem far useful estimate statistical model. Well I'm 3 hours let's see goes. Multi-dose vaccines known create better immunity also longer lasting immunity. theory immunity Pfizer Moderna last longer single shot vaccines.

There’s reason kids get 4 shots measles vaccine. afterwards they’re 98% protected life. WOOO!!!!! VERMONT'S HOUSE!!!

Sorry, make news often many big accomplishments, easy get overexcited. 🙂 vaccines prevent long covid could lung damage etc still occur even symptoms I'm far anti vaccine (I would take Pfizer time), try figure hospitalizations high ppl vaccinated. ability handle pandemic factor determining President, yes. much want President. idea stances important topics knows. Anecdotally, heard putting freezer causes marker reappear. Likely millions, definitely several thousand more, yes. Fortunately, vaccines here.

If use rough estimates, calculate many would need die, likely many infected already.

Brazil 211 mil people. Herd immunity threshold estimated around 70%. pretty safe IFR estimate probably .5%

70% 211 mil = 147.7 million. That's many Brazilians would need infected reach herd immunity naturally. IFR .5%, would yield 738.5k deaths.

Brazil currently 331k confirmed covid deaths. assume missed some, excess death numbers would imply, round 400k. 

That would mean Brazil would likely see another 300k+ deaths reached natural herd immunity. also use numbers get rough estimate seroprevalence.

If 738.5k deaths = 70% infected (HI threshold), means 400k deaths (where they're now) = around 38% infected. 

These rough estimates, give general idea show Brazil nowhere close herd immunity many would think. Even HI threshold 50% (which seems 70% likely), they'd still 12% off.

The vaccines change everything, they're likely cause deaths plummet pretty quickly since demographics highest rates mortality first vaccinated.

Hope explained well. Zoomers looking like boomers year. good sign. Imo good way increase % people come needle version 

many severe cases Trypanophobia likely gonna avoid vaccine altogether mostly needle involved tends freak simply speaks things done US. Follow FDA history you’ll see extremely strict sometimes delayed recommendations compared national peer groups countries. “play safe” one dose shot would effective? Probably. know could possibly know this. Texas locked HARD snowstorm February week, harder anything else US seen far. probably significantly suppressed transmission virus, takes time exponential growth get back track. least way know it’s getting vaccine rather wounded bullet. We’re kinda known rampant gun violence least jab distinguishable enough “shot” percentage republicans. surprised one they're selling countries. Yup - Texan behaviors changed bit. parents going insane kids home day. want kids back school covid damned. gives everyone chance protect themselves.

Except can't get vaccinated medical reason rely society herd immunity. evil. Well. university canceled study abroad programs Fall 2021. guess vaccinated months advance make difference it? Sorry, forgot /s. Thought needed reality check ;) Michigan third highest day cases ever based trends, week record territory. testing likely count bit low anyways. Interestingly enough, deaths starting tick little bit Michigan too. guess we'll see affecting younger people (40s 50s) like seem think Brazil. Maybe they're smoking weed playing video games escape stress overwhelmingly negative mental health effects unemployed living awful circumstances pandemic? started drinking watching live streams (video games) time cope, without doubt depressing year life. Read comments here. Many saying both.

Yes slmay spread, elderly risk vaccinated kids back school.

Here's data: Yet cases going up... Ikr... kind fucking coward admits previously wrong contradictory information becomes available seasonal virus. Deaths cases plummeted last spring too, didn’t mean pandemic over. need hit vaccination targets want prevent another wave fall. suspect unvaccinated people forged vaccination cards cause problems way found verify cards. Probably counting international travel. kind going wear N95 mask stay isolated foreseeable future. may never back-to-normal them. shouldn’t mean nobody else ever go back normal.

I disagree, vaccine mandatory everyone physically able get works goes school public, order protect immuno-compromised. know humans selfish, cause effect clear. unvaccinated might incubate variants undo effectiveness us get vaccinated. support stricter measures. vaccine, can’t enter country. Every country non vaccinated can’t travel. Unvaccinated kids also can’t go school. Unvaccinated people can’t renew drivers licence either. enforce vaccination. Personal freedoms trump variant developing shutting society again. Sorry, understanding state going implode everyone would die? good enough. immunity wanes, get shots 6 months every 6 months thereafter. order eradicate virus need herd immunity available hosts keep virus replicating spreading. clear, run single route crewed americans. literally cruise route world crewed americans, hawaii one. norwegian cruise wasnt around hawaii, almost definitely wasnt staffed americans BMI 30, fat. Period

BMI actually remarkably accurate 99% population first time he's suggested eventually safe stop wearing them?

No. even close. worst he’s ever said would continue 2022. There's also difference saying kids get vs saying get sick.

They get it, getting sick it. 

And add opinion someone pulled child preschool year sending back kindergarten September, hopefully person.

But dozen concerns children vs getting sick COVID. data data. based real-world study vaccinated workers take regular screening tests, immunity infection symptomatic article talks playing huge role *spreading* COVID.. one saying they’re hospitalized alarmingly high rates. mean? cant read article, boils reopening system works. disproportionate # cases deaths occur corona least healthy quartile zip codes, response that, state set targets administer 2 million 4 million doses zip codes. milestones reached, reopening criteria becomes looser zip codes tend hardest hit pandemic. right 3.93 million, next days looser reopening criteria enable counties reopen dunno man, CNN says due massive B117 surge. trust media recent? traveled NCL couple years ago employees seemed majority SE Asian. assume US residents, lead believe probably paid US wage laws. also think good primer reason probably start school kids old enough vaccinated fall. expect masks part, get community spread low enough, good enough. study article preprint peer-reviewed. much data coming support vaccines stopping spread, thoroughly vetted. Give time. sure end month CDC sufficient data confirm vaccines stop spread (not 100%, close). Bless Lol, seriously think permanent?

Puff puff pass dude. cases involve hospitalization? Odds remotely close.

Listen, coming someone pulled daughter preschool year sending back kindergarten fall. 

But data data, covid-19 insignificant kids, death standpoint hospitalization standpoint. False issue isn’t kids getting severely sick, it’s mode transport. They’re picking serial killer kills old people dropping retirement home. hypothetical kid fine kid also fucked lot shit up. study far blueprint. Consider top level requirements: increased air flow; improved filtration; sound levels disrupt learning. Increased air flow sound level limits probably mean bigger ductwork. Increased air flow improved filtration (i.e. system pressure drop) mean higher electrical draw yet bigger ductwork. Improved filtration takes space often electrical power. comes huge maintenance burden regular cleaning ductwork system components. systems ""ducts"" exposed plenums systems plenum (fire suppression, plumbing, electrical, phone/intercom/PA, data, ....) cleaning laborious time consuming. 

In cases ""you can't get here"" existing buildings. simply enough space. meantime? Shut schools two three years tear apart buildings upgrade? 

If we're going upgrade ventilation reasonable amount time going take out-of-the-box thinking probably new products (think time again), perhaps move centralized ventilation distributed ventilation. long argue cost, schedule, efficacy? 

My take: masks social distancing is. Really? Every person know that's vaccinated said effects second dose like short-term flu (to varying degrees severity). Yep. must heavy disonnance folks here, mocking EU's ""shambolic vaccination drive"" weeks, see EU vaccination rates approaching US weeks ago. best part going accelerate massive quantities vaccine made EU. dad yesterday got call Pfizer (Belgium), rate long get ours. Can't wait! Walensky never allowed television. can't decide whether wants fact based researcher, sensationalist spin-artist harm good. need official mouthpiece helps share accurate information way that's easily digestible non-scientists without alarmist, like press secretary. 

(side note, I'd love see someone like Jen Psaki giving updates instead). I'm fine *for now*, worried vaccine weeks started already serious side effects going suspended people age?

I understand panic, vaccine suspended forbidden think thing ""not worried all""... Seems like Australia blaming EU something AstraZeneca caused. far know exports one initial blocked shipment granted. Problem AstraZeneca facility Belgium currently facility used EU production exports ex-EU. simply production capacity fulfill either EU, Australian order. COLA percolating years sure get cost living raises anytime soon. 👁️👅👁️ work school around 600 middle schoolers fully person, masked scenario. got covid winter break, know another teacher also contracted covid year, like me, going work home. confident based movements got school told that’s possible. 8 homeroom kids quarantined, three positive kids know weeks got symptoms. know got it. exhaustion, constantly changing safety rules long hours wearing PPE things America’s health-care workers cite hardest parts going work front lines coronavirus pandemic. additional 7 percent said overworked hardest part working pandemic, many feeling exhausted put extra hours, covered sick co-workers coped limited resources dying patients. poll found among hospital workers, 56 percent said workplace reached overcapacity ICU beds places treat critically ill patients point pandemic. whole surfaces thing comes thought transmitted like seasonal flu.

I'm sure people know ever really thought that, want cause panic ""it's airborne"" messaging. still need kids get vaccinated? surprised slightest happening, cost living Vancouver quite high?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  course not. way say events spread virus. 45th POTUS way thinking ""Don't test, therefore exist"". They'll claim happened due parties ballgame. understand now. Good. teacher retail worker familiar protocols place settings. Teachers closer contact longer compared retail workers. also often quarantine often needing closer 6 feet younger students. (Not saying retail workers also haven’t risk don’t deserve prioritization vaccines - course course do!) Regardless, it’s definitely direct comparison. Oh, problem people going spreading around thus cases rise? time becomes problem soon starts affecting life right now, potentially could. like saying ""Oh, people feel safe around people text drive walk stay home"". doesn’t make less effective.

In fact, it’s generally thought longer spacing makes effective, least certain point, though trade spending longer period lower level protection between. Statistically speaking 99% checked insurance card ID. Nothing Well, we’re talking next winter 7 yr old wants like yesterday. 

It’s seriously going suck kids given year life, school, friends, activities STILL left waiting safe resume normal life. youngest desperately wants go school (preferably sans mask) &amp; get play friends’ houses. Let’s make safe too, shall we? feel people took vaccine better taking vaccine even though died it? I’ll take bet. Jan 28th 7 day average 3259. April 3rd 850. seems like vaccine could major choice keeping ICU overflowing. I've heard country live rollout government whoever brings sluggish compare country lived - US - going fast! I'm strongly wish country giving pace well. 70 FUCKING MASKS!!! people want tl;dr Precisely. lot Super Bowl attendances vaccinated healthcare workers though. Md open everyone tomorrow plus don’t ask looks like UK getting best results, results totally could gone different direction.

The UK looked data supply vaccines made decision wanted save people's lives prevent hospitalizations. US -- lot data available -- harassing Walgreens giving Pfizer second doses 3-week interval data showing would efficacious, . . . actually idea it. certainly based data showing better. 

I'm supposed getting second Pfizer dose tomorrow I've cancelled appointment. judgment waiting weeks second dose likely provide better protection long run. Ok dont actual counter argument, dumb. Enjoy death America lasts could read article... February 2021, 37,300 children aged 0 17 years lost least 1 parent due Covid-19, three-quarters adolescents,"" says research letter. Yup since comment I’ve gone 70%-90%. gonna lie pretty brutal I’d 5 times rather getting Covid worse, giving others.. data entered voluntary. also note reasons DB listed main page, physicians sharing info.

Your state one too. while, comment hits mark huge % reddit unable see it. We're probably clear today side effects. Tomorrow might different saw bit game 90% attendances least wear masks, let alone seat distancing.

Do attendance's contacts case? baptists. Yep lol. friends Midwest dramatic af worried us. told nothing would change (I live Austin), nothing changed. advice get you’re sick YOU. immune system already stimulated. don’t want make go crazy vaccine top that. Funny story one too, prophet vision blacks could full members weeks Nixon threatened tax exempt status. nothing else, least get idea based excess deaths compared years. Can't really blame you. finding make sense, I'd mildly skeptical new. makes sense consider like that... pay absolute shit. People better qualified tend find positions work sometimes work one jobs make living. nursing home industry US broken like medical industry even less safeguards. Checkmate... uh... poverty....

shit that's right. Though state longer limit size events, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine said participants would asked stay separated groups 10 fewer - rather merging one huge crowd - help reduce possible spread coronavirus.

Yeah, like people self govern well. Moderna one scheduled 4 weeks via official Los Angeles government run site (Carbon Health). 

I think either vaccine fine use 4 weeks (or even more) immunocompromised mother old father 50/50 odds dying COVID got it. either catch COVID, life plain over.

So stay home get vaccinated. can’t expect rest us same. Think Star Wars, Attack Clones.

Either getting vaccinated getting COVID start production Clone Army Kamino. take time clone troops raise get ready fight. take time get equipment ready too. 

However, vaccine like head start. get army built ready fight lot sooner actual covid invasion happens without warning!

So even getting exposed virus five days getting vaccinated make less sick vaccine all, since clone troopers ready fight five days sooner otherwise would.

And well, full period passed... virus chance. :)

(Yay got use Star Wars analogy! makes happy.) timing here. Feels good hear someone else feeling similar. folks eating Tide pods long ago? 

Seems like weird line sand draw taking account they've already stuffed throats. seems like is, wouldn’t surprise fades away stop talking vaccines time.

It’s still “flu shot,” that’s one talk most. Disgusting attitude towards human life 

Firstly go another tangent like first comment. Everyone getting vaccines, even poorest nations wont able afford them, whether humanitarian aid etc. know way eradicate COVID whole world vaccinated. vaccines priced per recommendation available everyone cheap affordable.

Secondly know specifics finances public fund specifics talking going roll it. elect govt pay taxes them, trust put money wherever, democracy. R&amp;D, grants etc upto them. 

Most R&amp;D actually bankrolled philanthropists investors. public interested govt spending money stuff rather R&amp;D anyways.

And lets say UK public give money govt give Oxford develop vaccine. patents opened, company eg Indonesia able make vaccine make money free? 

This mean freebie. got nothing human life, Indonesian public get vaccine, govt good, free subsidized. profit going Indonesian company rather Oxford. would govt even give money Oxford future incentive would Oxford even develop vaccine.

Anyways wont discussing further, even topic original comment. company discussing return office. condition employment us present office least days week. I’m advocating requiring vaccine return know people refuse get vaccine able remain employed us I’m still comfortable decision. think us following closely expected see another small spike states started get back business usual even showing younger/ healthy adults vaccinated. People partying cross finish line bit worrisome. yeah seems general idea everyone i’ve talked to, thanks! can’t speak experience possibility social distancing/mask compliance (depending region region), retail workers scapegoats entire time. I’m school speech pathologist speak experience damn it’s tough. space doesn’t allow social distancing, I’ve quarantine twice plus multiple covid scares kids caseload mysteriously disappeared weeks... etc etc. ugh:( Yeah, don’t seem get it. reason people praise “surviving trump” trump would fire didn’t get soft drink fast enough. Anyone didn’t totally parrot trump said gone end day. That’s fired special. 

This isn’t politics me. Science science. times science gets wrong correct said. That’s flaw, it’s part system, it’s adults function exposed new evidence would admit something true? got J&amp;J morning. arm slightly sore, I'm good. I'm little tired guess, nothing crazy. I'm 11hrs post vaccine People see want see. Literally another post call white evangelicals skeptic one says anything race called out.

Here say something good white evangelicals commenting white headline.

I'm white hella confused lool yeah, pretty much India China sending enough vaccines sacrificing countries (a bit). 

It is. Everyone's gonna wait 3 4 behemoths get vaccines get it. point getting downvoted anyways media drawing separation, church. based im seeing, cdc already recommends similar things study suggests: immunocompromised mother old father 50/50 odds dying COVID got it. either catch COVID, life plain over. drowning 5 figures inherited credit card debt even place live. tell I'm virtue signaling, really matter life death whole pandemic shit. 

We MAYBE 20% population vaccinated across country, mention still transmitted even low risk. Hell, cases rise right now. said another thread, hellsite become anti-social distancing? need get past bullshit requirements vaccines actually get needles arms rather bureaucratic insanity going right now. Mormom Church offical racist policies late 70s made similar statement 2 months ago local sub banned making hateful remarks. Saves lives puts mind ease. surge timelines similar. probably take long time parse data pandemic over. need year. people they're able to, assumption someone earns $5/day would never able afford lifetime.

 ""Mandatory"" sense able least life, can't got vaccine. Sorry, I’m even less scared (not all). bike, sure. large portion employed commute 15, 20, 30 miles direct route freeway, mention half days year bike safely due weather, much option. case guess anecdote doesn’t apply :) everything heard though doctors want numbers, fussed documentation, appointment want get vaccinated didn’t even know existed 90s. Maybe wasn’t NY. I’m planning getting it, get feeling extent. keep living distanced, masked, no-indoor-activities life I’m living vaccinated, I’m really vaccine going doctor guarantee get really sick 2-3 days. There’s little risk getting COVID daily life, degree feels like “why bother?” Okay? Nobody asked opinion. need snarky stating want behave differently. Eh, ya he’s reasonable it’s like prognostications overly optimistic. one first mention we’d possibly wearing masks 2022 cult loosely inspired Christianity, yes. 

My favorite part book depicts ""Israelites"" pale, plump German-looking folks. logical answer. It’s never black white people think is.   yet movie theatres bars already check ID age. really get problem here. Banning passports probably fastest way winning next election.  Youre crazy think people support things. might surprised quick get appointment. became eligible today able get appointment already...for tomorrow. point literally mitigate wtf notion lockdowns mask mandates effect silly. know COVID spread breathing air sick person breathing. Taking steps stop like wearing masks staying apart therefore result fewer sick people.

They're one factor, factor relatively easy control. Things like weather, tendencies based political leanings, requirements whatever sort industry provides jobs area, configuration housing transit, population density dumb luck lot harder anything about. I'm even surprised even rare moment positivity coming him, STILL managed bring voting made weak attack toward Biden. things never change guess, bare minimum even fraction supporters listen get vaccine, that's net positive. once.  Well, say supported idea. I'm pointing government already file you.

I also already acknowledged use anything, think use stuff lot things. ever buy alcohol go bar? Papers please. Get pulled busted tail light? Papers please. Ran red light? camera took picture number back car name.

I'm defending idea, I'm pointing FAR first time something like might happening. studies shown vaccine 100% effective preventing serious covid cases? risk there? data long covid risk post-vaccination. reasons hopeful without data choose experimental risk taker. It’s pandemic, get it. happened humanity thousands years since started living cities. don’t see weeping Black Plague victims Spanish flu victims. People ignore eventually move life, like previous pandemics. good. don’t want idiots like near Gov. Larry Hogan Monday announced Marylanders 16 older get vaccine state mass vaccination sites starting Tuesday.

They said today, yesterday I’m guessing highly dependent sport. Tennis would lower spread something like wrestling maybe even indoor basketball. Also think US younger populatio isn’t falling everywhere, [as we’re clearly seeing rise multiple I’m pretty sure already understand that, tho. 

That said, overall national trend demo higher August November. It’s also skewing average hospitalization age lower lower. But, again, I’m almost positive know already, too.  Much sooner. UK supply constraint, US doesn't. Plus people take it. guess maybe simple. Also stats (from World Data) percentage population including kids. Take percentage vaccinated total eligible looks better. Maybe simply immense supply meaning free point big deal.

If handle it, power them. No, I'm touting doomsday events. I'm touting disruptions testing reporting. anymore! vaccine card name it, even photocopy you’ll still need present ID matches name card. company fully remote ten years. Basically pure remote companies operate way. CDC didn’t say that. said don’t know can’t fucking media ran reporters stupid.  Now. sure go fully remote. Hell fuckin yeah brother. Preach. maybe they’d rather potentially save life let someone come store?....... You’re making different argument OP. You’re saying it’s safe, he’s saying doesn’t want give private medical info. I’m addressing point yours. Yeah, 1 10,000 even mean? infected person touches surface within 30 minutes person B touches surface, 0.01% chance getting Covid?

Or 10,000 infections, 1 person got via touching, rest got via air?

If second case, could possibly know? don’t see study linked. basically source this?

That half software developers U.S. salary claimed people ""rarely"" gout outside particularly familiar US Canadian markets, Europe able get senior software engineer $100k/year.

I've software engineer six years east coast U.S. make $120k. Software engineer salaries U.S. dramatically higher countries, even outside SV. really hope we'll able give Astrazeneca people 55 then, we're gonna run older people vaccinate weeks! Well guess that's cost living adjustment, guess salary makes sense. see everything going remote pay salaries need salary live near office. surprised see many dim witted conservative views this. idiots. can’t believe live country ppl Sunday. Easter Sunday. happens Wednesday reason celebrate. get that. cases aren’t quantifiable deaths &amp; hospitalizations (right now, anyway) best way determine it’s going. Thank you. Yes, terrible. Fair enough - think ""why government all"" deserves response ""those things wrong too"" think we're agree disagree stage conversation. 

The next stage debate way scope covid/vaccines lol. mean private businesses? choose require employees get vaccinated returning work. Lori Lightfoot: “Nah....let’s move back July 1st....because said so” telling Evangelicals ""love thy neighbor"" ever actually convinced anything though? certainly make love gay people, liberals, atheists, people abortions, etc. state opening general population two weeks, unless one variants blow up, expect fully vaccinated August latest. I'll wait I'm vaccinated sure I'm locking another year people tested positive post-vaccine. 

I'll continue wearing mask public post-vaccine positive tests become huge issue I'm vaccinated. good alternative vaccine AZ. known sanitizing surfaces waste time beginning. airborne virus, surface-borne virus. LMFAOOOOO TRUEEE HAHAHA. 

they say private companies disallow service gay people it’s religion 😂

but say private companies disallowing service someone hasn’t proved they’re safety health liability CIVIL LIBERTIES INFRINGED UPON CREATING TWO CLASSES SOCIETY. won’t happen federal level. see that's pessimistic statement, even sounds like face value. reasonable measured response based data time made. Things continue change virus daily basis. Sometimes better, sometimes not. 

That's reason can't stand people say ""flip-flopped"" last year, reality, anyone understands science statistics infectious diseases tell constant game ever-changing information trying get ahead next major shift. quad mutant Awww... that's bad. garunteed damage better remote possibility follow reasonable logic. shrug. wish could spell color right way :) Polo? We've know while. talking ICU nurse, mentioned vast majority patients see quite obese. matter there's ban something going happen anwyays? What's issue Guardian? I'm saying there's one option. People always come excuse. going event likely require form ticketing either e-ticker paper someone wants go figure way print piece paper. first world entitlement know is. course always wary, first post much medical information giving looking ""AIDS: Yes/No?""

as imply that's next step. think anyone would agree that's step far. valid argument previous step? Maybe right ""fix"" regulation must built time limit like ""regulation expires 60 days"" - necessarily all.

BTW record I'm actually laws saying need vaccination ""passport"" mostly know it'd clusterfuck time figure it'll months possibly even needed. slippery slope type argument. private business able enact versions want to. Higher supply lower uptake. Ha. Michigan here. one even asked ID got first dose. Looking forward hearing retractions threads earlier... Oh yeah probably included weekends, bad. They're discussed media. They're preemptively banned. still much wearing PPE, wear masks people, particular around people potentially carrying. Could someone explain US opening eligibility fast? 

The sources see show 32% people US received first dose. UK 47% yet still offering people. Seems quite early US offering wide range? said fuck leave free all? 

Really great know well guessing great supply less concern. seems like early stage stop prioritising older people. trials involved ~30,000 people. 

There 1.8 million fully vaccinated Michigan.

11 1.8 million .000611%.

And suspect even though “fully vaccinated” likely caught vaccines full effect. Well... 21 days. common sense. Social distancing relies diffusion high viral concentration (infected face) low (ambient air) inverse square distance. confined unventilated setting stops walls, point gradient reduces diffusion becomes ineffective lowering viral concentration unless replace air restore gradient. unvaccinated people still intermingle vaccinated people aren’t able even get virus anymore. oh yea it’s civil rights violation. Ff. show you’re vaccinated go school. vaccines private medical records, they’re public health necessities keep population alive lol. 

or schools universities also CREATING TWO CLASSES PEOPLE THOSW RIGHTS AND.... lmaoo u sound dumb asf 4/20 gonna lit

Has anyone done study spread COVID people smoking weed together? kids fine, maybe years total GOP control fucked us enough

Got sources that? schenario? They're letting vaccinated people enter except u/TomOnTheInterweb? 

If they're making everyone vaccinated enter, everyone vaccinated, letting non-vaccinated people in, longer assume everyone vaccinated. think some, uneasy fact new vaccines rushed market. understand point. initially bit uneasy fully vaccinated. think others eventually get past reservations. 

&amp;#x200B;

Others drunk kool-aid regards wild theories 5G, population control, nanobots, etc. folks beyond help probably end catching covid already. things wrong, too, they’re heavily enforced fines normalized. can’t allow normalized, absolutely wreckless make statements like position trust. unimpressed media throughout pandemic, can't criticize reporting direct quote EMA head vaccines.

These announcements need handled extremely carefully could major trust issues could impact uptake vaccines. local sub (not local covid sub) got really mad complained governor give thresholds restrictions go away. They're mad complaints asking thry could go away vaccination thresholds, even demanding go away now. late.

Michigan restrictions place. Restaurant capacity limits mask mandate, exceeding testing target goals, higher national average vaccination.

We among first dip manageable case level, first rise again. Though I'm seeing uptick quite states.

Fact michiganders started traveling January, picked variants brought back them. outbreak months making.

Concerning thing is, people traveling country. Texas, florida, new York, california, georgia etc etc. see em all, hotels 70% full. 

And visitors go home.

I think biggest issue US faced pandemic unrestricted travel, really undermined efforts. know ho could go restricting it, especially public really wants move forward. we're celebrating victory soon. Dozens states well 1,000 daily cases. New York 6,000, Michigan 11,000.

Michigan's 3-6 weeks ahead curve, without proper measures taken, happen everywhere else. Especially since many states already zero restrictions all.

The alarming thing is, Michigan paper things right, like said above. living states without mask mandates may wanna start dusting makes off. 

Being michigan resident, god lose control fast. Yeah agree 100%. Still would interesting find details. dude need stop living life fear. You’re afraid things cannot control. want do. want live life fear, you’ll stay locked never get comfort zone experience new things. want live life righteousness path, you’ll live getting comfort zone, learning wisdom experiences others, keeping true you’re meant be. Wear mask, social distance, don’t let put complete fear following one dose strategy,

No, we're not. end March we've concentrating first doses, we're catching second doses. We've leaving longer time doses clinical trials did, always 2 dose strategy. want answer even one question people asking state live accuse lying vaccine eligibility.

I would gladly get vaccine even later people would continue voluntarily wear masks public social distance everyone safe, people families social circles. helps me, doesn't. helps *everyone else*. stupid would reduce cases actually hear tired home like return, anyone else? Oh, mean keep Texans states requiring vaccine passports??! I'm friends someone interned CNN Atlanta last summer, apparently told me, large majority employees talked actually voting Trump due fears laid low ratings get re-elected.  going estimates someone saying 8x increase salary. median Facebook worker earns 240k year skilled software guy good options right degree skills could easily making 400k total compensation. else people buying 2.5M dollar bay area houses? place filled people disdain absolutely social interaction mislabel social anxiety introvert. understand downvoted. Walgreens notorious crap like that. Anyone downvoted probably hassled before, sure hell have. lack communication doctors pharmacists terrible well. know be, I'm lucky good job family. I'm sure too.

The people fucked kids grandkids, people privileges enjoy. 10+ years total GOP control fucked us enough, sure it'll stay power another 10 years. would matter many tests done people hospitalized/die it? effective true, things health system mainly overwhelmed younger unvaccinated people opened quickly. And....?

If think government interference bad even drivers licenses register cars, police, government all?

So specifically harm here? see slightly annoying show something get venue lots places already require ID anyways enter alcohol involved. July: We're (at least rich country) Maryland April 26th till said 13th yesterday that’s happening right now. least state non ICU hospitalizations back up.(MN)

The point I’m getting numbers dynamic day day basis expecting government policy follow sort timeline unreasonable went down, going back up.

That’s plateau, that’s increase.

An increase numbers go up.

The numbers going up, cases, hospitalizations, likely deaths lag.

Maybe they’ll go next week, going up, source shows clearly.

A 13% increase cases two weeks plateau, it’s 13% increase cases.

Key word.

Increase. like without clear evidence reckless.

Fortunately, talking medical proffesional reddit morons. know evidence, cant show now. I'm sick articles pretend like government restrictions somehow factor COVID cases write stupid ""gotcha"" bits. 

Can stop stupid while? Please? Uhm yeah opinion... said differently? need ID vaccine, want? thousands times likely get covid blood clots.

So, lot likely get yet still killed less younger people AZ Norway. two different things: exists physical biological laws show example physically biologically impossible. 



But exists statistical, mechanical mathematical law states balanced coin would never this. probability happening incredibly low. Switzerland's outcomes appear significantly better UK's, likely due better health, earlier detection, lack healthcare system overwhelm. ideal, keep desk. threat losing desk, go 5 days office.

Hot desking absolute garbage. Honestly imagined thing private businesses would option use short window needed. Like things involving activities would better enjoyed maskless - like concerts night club bar, like extra ID bouncers check get green light enforce masks anymore.

Calling 'passports' what's intimidating everyone - assure called 'vaccine ID' stir much uproar. want know enormous propaganda push AstraZeneca vaccine. 

It seems like day 1 got sensational click bait bad press vaccine. 

This blood clot story recent, phase 3 trial volunteer got placebo died covid. Also seen people pouring peer reviewed articles vaccine way AZ.

🤔 Mask mandates proactive measure, fire trucks showing house fire reactionary

If try make analogy would stick built homes fire extinguishers Trump got himself. search logic her. find none. Bro everyone doesn’t get vaccine anti vaxxer hill manually verified. checked yet guess. cnn repost seen posted chose wrong. want second dose seeing Germany recommended people get them. I'm exact demographic problems affect. 

How figure? EMA said even concluded issue. official jumped gun, Germans exactly conducted full study matter led anything conclusive. ever looked side effects vaccines received? refuse too?

Corporate America packed people grift others use work social escape.

They’d never given control people easily. even post stuff like this? it’s universally accepted AZ causes blood clots stop filling peoples minds hesitancy? mean come fuck on. I'm talking ""95% effective"" vaccines. lower 80% want - point applies. people able spread virus. 

The spread go helps people vaccinated. likely, people either hang people don't, stricter rules really change that. Exactly!! office really old school I’m glad changed things allow flexibility, it’s same. Eh, basically source this?

I'm particularly familiar US Canadian markets, Europe able get senior software engineer $100k/year.

For SV salaries there's this: #'s non vaccinated group. can't process simple information surely comment it. even reading you’re writing? ignoring everything I’m saying copy pasting replies prewritten? Wait wait wait. think *Texas* elects hate-America nihilists!? young healthy, chances die Covid less risking possible blood clot AZ. 

I think so. compare two young people - one covid one blood clots - sure, one blood clots likely die. thousands times likely get covid blood clots. clear link ? Tell article ? See can’t don’t says clear link evident lol guys terrible I'll wait another 6 months year get vaccine. truth is, vaccines unapproved FDA, dont extensive studies done yet. want wait least 2 years solid data. Danish article lancet talking data, I've mashed together somehow! numbers Germany little scarier, though still rare. 1/100,000, almost youngish women. It’s likely, it’s nothing. think guys overrate likelihood getting covid you’re cautious. anti-vax (I mine), I’m also realist. People don’t want vaccine might kill them, even risk low. cases going reach herd immunity, what’s point restrictions? care sooo much. open, considerate friendly towards neighbors...  


(This sarcasm btw) getting shots Trump solely responsible means liberals win? /s I'm saying Fauci said early 2020 though: no, fuck masks. scary see kind super high end masks suggests thry stay else one wouldnt invest much making product.

I hate masks much worst part thr pandemic me. anyone know chart shows number vaccines distributed week? Definitely misread somewhat, article Federal government gonna get shit done Reddit love this.

Have ignored past 18 months GOP talking COVID real, big deal, vaccine untested, etc?

""Skepticism"" ass.

This entire /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM may make feel morally superior lets issues continue. Nothing work matters world. get paid well misc busy work helps company sell widgets.

I family, hobbies, interests that’s life about. Real Question.

Are Christian?

Because were, understand big difference White Evangelicals Black Evangelicals.

There's people sides (more Black side probably) trying mend gap, ol' Donny torn open pretty big wounds festering evangelical church awhile.

If Christian understand differences two, I'd recommend reading listening there's lot good content coming days. month ago? That's plateau Time buy stock Young median age. Low rates obesity. reason given automod notification? think ok increase authoritarian measures certain times. That's rational position hold. position mostly disagree with. honest actually saying.

Do actually find inconceivable measures implemented ""for public good"" never become permanent infringement societies rights? people forget NSA's existence? Texan, worried first fact everyone talked shit Texans dumb

Well-earned really. Look constant parade idiots hate-America nihilists bumpkins keep electing. YA AINT MISSING MUCH

Unless dig compensatory reverb dad-metal. I'm saying do. seem asserting certain things false-- chances getting infected vaccination nonzero, chances spreading virus vaccination nonzero, pandemic still ongoing daily new cases compared last summer. saying risk small care about, mostly feel impact personally.

What I'm amazed someone profession would little interest public health subject, little regard lives others concept, all. guess unrealistic level expectations people professions, guess. Yeah know misses feels starved, MUCH smaller since I've living like this. mean, yeah, breast cancer. 
 
You got good study? live upper Midwest that’s true. weather broken within last week so, thats recent made impact. 2-3 weeks you’ll see massive decline.

If look map cases rising vs falling it’s pretty much exclusively north 37th parallel.

Weather &amp; seasonality key indicator throughout entire pandemic, makes sense trend would continue. Sounds right. Consult doctor. weird anti-vaxx freak based prior comments. ignore maybe go away? guy fired? hate ruin day, stage already:

[Retinal findings hospitalised patients severe imaging study diagnoses COVID-19: case Retinopathy Patient Well really depends live, considering strong covid wave around globe right now, personally would take whatever comes faster. ability choose, means pick something else, delay vaccinated option AZ. Also, reports blood clots Pfizer Moderna's vaccines well, much displayed papers, rest assure thing 100% safe vaccine.  interview Dagsrevyen Easter. we've vaccinated around 120.000 people AZ Norway six seven people reported hospitalised symptoms around 1 20.000. consider mental illness, whether pandemic pre-existing. Better alternative option headed towards:

    ""hospitalization among seniors declining half age group dead"" Yes is. You’re putting carriage horse. Texan, worried first fact everyone talked shit Texans dumb state showed responsible (not requiring masks yet every business still requiring people obeying guidelines) makes one proud Texan! Funny, I'm telling mine I'll looking another job go back office nobody else there. mobile can't see mod flair. title beyond misslesding post removed. I'm sure plenty people want get vaccinated due apathy, laziness reason that's ideological. becomes requirement people get motivated it.

That increases overall vaccinations reduces covid cases.  chance. everyone eligible vaccine case count gets low enough, vaccine mandates go away. End summer latest. back forth bullshit really annoying playing hands antivaxxers. either link isnt. helps noone scare people unnecessarily. consider Phil Vischer Lecrae ""the media?"" pandemic literal godsend agency's facilities group. getting squeezed space plan late 2019 either shrink everyone's cubes third move like 25% staff offsite, unanimously unpopular alternatives.

Now entire workforce WFH pretty much effective, management decided want keep WFH clear given, problem condition give desk office. I'm guessing half staff elected go mostly remote, thanks Covid solved facilities problem without really thinking even new thing. 2019, voted ban state income tax Texas one proposing one already exist fear. self-righteousness. people brag miserable they've made themselves. like people brag many hours work week. speak English dude? 

If states restrictions higher spread states without, means measures taking control R0 working. Misrepresenting say. said article misleading. Look title says clear LINK evidence inside article. Let's it! predict go well exit US electric grid went! feel like reason, afraid say it. mess. covid requires daily proof vaccination via phone app meanwhile virus require proving vaccination ONE TIME Trust verify mean verifying every time. did, would verify trust even mentioned. Yeah pretty clear stricter rules put place rise cases. strict rules place months cases went starting go back again, opposed places like Texas rules removed cases deaths falling.

If actually want discussion could argued fatigue restrictions led people flaunting said restrictions put risk infection, perhaps relaxation said restrictions could causal relationship uptick compliance ""suggestions"" rather ""mandates"".

But want logical discussion. feels like we’re living medical drama tv show lmfao Good point, yeah office everyone works different (mostly home) location believe would full FDA approved vaccine. believe Pfizer predicts there's approved year, can't find article now. heading to?
Our speed picking quite reasonably, see complete data Coronadashboard.Rijksoverheid.nl fda/pfizer stated side effect, AZ state vaccine cause CVST, even though evident (spare correlation thing, norway proved causation) taking victory lap might help read article specifies evidence provided support claim. someone immune suppressant (Costentyx previously Humira) would take risk anyway absolute outstanding results auto immune conditions particularly cosentyx I’ve issues side effects. literally call everything ads. don’t allow pharma ads country I’ve seen ones US shocked *adds up* (in common parlance):

`1-(1-(1/10000))^200 = ~2%`

I'd say 2% risk infection months non-negligible.  get EUA that's possible. another year? following linea states evidence suggest link dude chose say anyway last month, cases plateaued. Wonderful. proving vaccinated one time showing PAPER documentation far different using cell phone app daily live society. don’t facilities, plans make one selling right now. don’t think anyone really giving freedoms agree mentality troubling, actual health benefit. biggest cost pandemic me, finding lot people thought agreed issues feel justified forcing opinions others long it’s “safety.” Guess then, let's stop trying anything extra. Mission accomplished?

We trying make cases go even faster make sure plateau relatively high level initially going bit. lets us get back normal much sooner. Spoken like true work-from-home employee. privy effects revenue margins had? know - everyone thinks things like money matter business, would one work important. vaccines schools required around actually FDA approved. Yeah well safe there. US massively ordered wanted cover options. options like Sanofi didn’t work out, Novavax still trial AZ it’s thing. ordering ton everything ensured got vaccines. way gone wrong would every candidate failed that’s different extreme worst case scenario. post reddit already sought help? talking guy quarantines food 3-4 days, think bragging, saying angry others chance. 

He also said health condition made high risk. started ""if opportunity"" things ended ""Some, really made angry, given opportunity believe owed avoid many risks employer made piss-poor decisions them; insufficient government support"" Looking forward hearing retractions threads earlier... say full blown normal July 4th. Logistically it’s possible. Financially makes LOT sense. states pushing target date. wildest part translating diffraction patterns something comprehensible 🤯

the fact Rosalind Franklin et al could interpret patterns realize double helical structure DNA boggles mind. “In opinion, say it, clear association (of brain blood clots) vaccine. However, still know causes reaction,” Marco Cavaleri, chair vaccine evaulation team EMA, told Italian daily Il separate interview, Armando Genazzani, member EMA’s Committee Medicinal Products Human Use (CHMP), told La Stampa daily “plausible” blood clots correlated AstraZeneca vaccine.

Two people two separate interviews said link. title makes clear source EMA official speaking interview. Again, unless think individuals lying, reason say misleading. I’m curious why? you’re vaccinated, almost zero danger go eat go movie. People need get infected infection noticed, either test, becoming symptomatic, or, unfortunately, requiring hospitalization (if possible, many states still hospitals still full, Michigan).

So there's weeks lag restrictions lifted, new cases rising, cases reported. several states severe irregularities around case reporting, including reporting lower numbers actual attempting prosecute state employees made new case information available (Florida).

For instance, Texas low numbers right removed restrictions. 

The state several times loosened restrictions put back place spike resulted. (Or, precise, actually scheduled lifting restrictions, response spike, stayed current level instead reimplementing past restrictions, done). seems retracted statement come full statement established clear link evidence support it, well would authoritative would accept it. Waiting evidence shifting goal posts. Gonna need evidence anecdotes one doctor one hospital Yup, [CDC need test quarantine around someone confirmed COVID long symptoms yourself. “Huh, didn’t know giving COVID-19 shots Orangutans” - brain Plus people pro WFH threads tend Redditor Tech People, job computer. education past year WFH necessary evil I'll glad rid of. Teaching works best person. fact, jobs work best person. think Tech WFH crew vocal minority forums. hear out...maybe *just maybe* covid mostly spreads indoor gatherings, whether small family events, largescale events, etc.

While retail spread, restaurant spread, etc *are* vectors, might large vectors spread. Even am, strict lockdowns, even joining them, people knew still seeing friends family. 

Business closures restrictions stop spike spreading heavily businesses first place. CDC supports vaccinated individuals interacting one another, especially households time. even stated safe vaccinees travel. stated vaccinated. good eyes public health. studies done looking weight deaths/hospitalizations? 109489% day pandemic started.

Neither matter current trends.

Cases increasing, went down, people got complacent, going up, see deny like many people denied second wave, third wave, like cases came down, snd went back up.

You say don’t give shit, denial reality bit much. white evangelicals anti-vaxx though. exactly ""this sub""? Oh know, adverse effects may delay nix chances AZ shot approved US.  
I essentially healthcare field, chances fall going required proof vaccination. doubt letter study sites letterhead suffice tbh. I'll happy ""the future face masks"" people wear old cloth COVID masks public know they're sick, realistically expect happen.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m fear mongering type - quite opposite actually. think really need limit type thinking all. grip control crisis. People become terrified existing world even vaccinated, seeking control everyone around ....we keep layering “safety” mechanisms make ppl feel justified continuing thought pattern. never guarantee person wouldn’t exposed something, anywhere. That’s life. 

I understand going workplaces schools things required - international travel, think it’s better places limited. 

I guess it’s don’t like direction society going need direction change. I’m Democrat, also value freedoms. don’t expect world bend backwards keep “safe” safety sort end goal. reeks dark ages religious crap me. Okay. Best guess. many ~255 million adults US support idea of, least, commenter asked for, Federal government stepping requiring vaccine passport many things essentially forces states comply? schools colleges get first 2/3rds fall semester (i.e August/September probably Thanksgiving) without one variants blowing up, think go ""normal"" next year, exception virtual learning want possibly optional masks campus. mods good things reported. I'm sure does. that's state fucked. I'm Ontario Canada something similar. oldest bracket going get Pfizer Moderna hospital vaccine centre whatever pharmacies stock AZ give 65+ changed 55+.

More people able get shot like instead vaccines laying around. cant wait see next goalpost youbare going push come full statement. literally always vaccines work. Thanks andrew wakefield rediscovery 2021? Didn’t stop everyone making claims UN stating evidence human human transmission covid. Sounds like normal day me. Doesn’t make less dumb. says otherwise False dichotomy. good news? Theory: locking people delays inevitable spread. aren’t allowed go eat, go concert, go sports game, forced get actually want return normal society said ‘clearly link.’ employer says ‘no, haven’t yet established this.’ That’s pretty text book contradiction. particular incidence nearly uncommon dsystopian making sound. people WFH begin realize corporate bosses hire entire globe going virtual. think ok increase authoritarian measures certain times. That's rational position hold. position mostly disagree with. honest actually saying.

I define terms I'll give it. Yes think reasonable certain times. example think government force register/inspect car annually, force certain venues check ID make sure I'm age. we're calling things authoritarian I'll agree actually find inconceivable measures implemented ""for public good"" never become permanent infringement societies rights? 

Of course find inconceivable like government required ID buy alcohol buy pharmacy drug. buy cough syrup require ID already, soon it'll aspirin, deodorant know use ID even buy water. would terrible.

Remember riots last year national guard cities? That's slippery slope right stops government putting military cities make sure we're kept line? what's suggested? what's happening?

Do people think restaurants require check people's vaccination records even year now? yes, that'd insane. seems we're worried kinds slippery slope much vaccine much Nyquil. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, you’re right. mean current conditions. someone live city tho? shady everyone reddit taking comments one official gospel EMA come deny. 

Nuts. convinced people love jerking anti-AZ news. prove anything said disprove anything said? stroke right now?

Edit: also problematic portray opinions bad actors platform entire GOP anyone describes republican. ever heard nuance? Maybe people chance get vaccinated cases/hospitalizations/deaths come back earth.  No. I've read r/Europe. Hopefully Norwegians could chime Realistically venues want open sooner, proof vaccination helps that, I'd it. mention pushes people get vaccinated otherwise bother reach herd immunity get cases transmission floor. probably near zero look Social Media: many IG stories, partying boats, partying clubs, drinking, dancing. Yeah, people pretty much done now, good bad. 1% month ago. That's plateau. u go take vaccine He's wrong, realistically democracies never going send significant numbers vaccines poorer countries people vaccinated. Places like China Russia people going say shit work, need US EU want really get shots out.

Wait June, going see hardcore vaccine diplomacy. US massively overorder can't count. ~330,000,000 people US. Ah ok sorry thought new news Yeah think return full normal July 1 reasonable. joke? Obviously recommended dosage better half recommended dosage consistent. intensity changes usually day get brain focus things, gets pretty bad night morning.

I'm extremely worried second shot make worse. Yeah, read it. They're even using numbers. According survey cited themselves, 40% surveyed reported vaccinated. There's big difference 40% 50%. They're honest.

Which seems like dog whistle. 

And also seems problematic call evangelicals turn around focus racial identity one population within evangelical population.

If want take look evangelicals vaccinated maybe take look said churches may lead vaccine skepticism rather color ears listening sermon. currently living social distancing &amp; lockdowns.

As society opens up, probability infected unvaccinated person significantly increase. hasnt. still research doesnt contradict shitm one logical?
An increase cases leading stricter rules.
Or stricter rules leading increase cases.  asking restrictions air travel, land?

Or asking land-travelers trustworthy less dangerous air travelers?

The first question answers. second includes assumptions. vaccine brand new hasn’t even approved FDA yet. true kill peaceful way. Pandemic life life doesnt end vacines youth end wasted completely asbim ny 30s wont amything live for.

the worst seeing comments people glad smug extend sad excuse life. wish could stomp heads Let’s Alex Jones Fauci live TV fight differences, I’d pay open then. Nah be, death rate 9/11 every single day, stupid American changed way SC calculates percent positives well probable vs confirmed qualifications right around end February. go CDC numbers compare dhec reported, cdc percent positive 3x higher. one point PP like 3.8% CDC site 11%. also seems like first-world problem, proposed people never visited poor town developing country. Whole families live together square meters. Many places sewer, clean water, hospitals, etc, people literally go morning earn money buy food dinner. Millions people already live streets, number likely increased 2020. ""maximum"" suppress virus areas?

This. Even developed countries lots poor areas social distancing home working next impossible. 

If go recommendation article people die starvation sars-cov-2 variant. becoming contest among republican governors see Trumpiest. Got neck neck race right Abbott Desantis Noem sliding first place ranking recent weeks. Good point really want know much virus still circulating. I’m interested in. filled dread horror, actually somewhat nervous sister gave birth, knowing came risk death.

It's one things acknowledge risk, acknowledge making nervous, allow consume you. touch contaminated surface, there's 1 10,000 chance getting infected surface. dont understand 19% worried virus also don’t plan ever get vaccine (not counting maybe 0.5% legitimate medical reasons able get it). coin 100 times row it’s heads every time, odds it’s heads next time? 50% course.

Unrelated everything else, flip coin 100 times get 100 heads chance getting heads extremely high, coin loaded af. passport isn’t something flashy brag shot. don’t need passport would help businesses workers want reopen crowds also feel safe less liability getting people sick. govt level would help businesses. \+1 Bulgaria, went AZ Sanofi, got small doses Pfizer, even smaller Moderna declined go J&amp;J (until talk EU ordered small amount).

AZ clusterfuck Sanofi seems vaporware moment, we're stuck back vaccination efforts EU. Even though would never died COVID.

That's risk people underestimate - overestimating vaccine risk. 

I know population group in. UK, overall population, 2 chances 1000 die coronavirus last 12 months. way chances spend unpleasant time hospital, followed life long disabilities.

It's counterintuitive, vaccine jab gives one chance million die stroke, takes one chance one thousand die coronavirus, take jab. would say concerning use case (cancer therapy). scenario risk-benefit trade-off undoubtedly favour using Ad assume efficacy, VIPIT possible adverse event therapy. possible AE exceedingly low probability absolutely insignificant efficacy treating cancer. Look deem acceptable adverse effects current cancer treatments like radiation, bone marrow transplants, surgery chemotherapy. I’m negative. Let rates drop 1% like Israel, feel differently (but note still enforcing mask mandates using vaccine passports there). must better way tell people keep precautions couple weeks anyone get vaccine ""mask up! pandemic/covid over!"" I've recently seen public transit today's Google doodle. Like get officials trying say, agree overall sentiment given covid almost certainly become endemic disease pandemic continuing rest world restrictions US lifted, feel officials use positive reinforcement emphasize thing *almost* US. think opened new one NJIT Newark, along ones South Jersey. Yea see days 100 cases since last year. fact AZ blood clot risk isn’t political.

The fact media outlets justified closing society year disease 99.7% survival rate telling refuse AZ case you’re one 300 people gets blood clot definitely is. Nice shifting goalposts. talking *government imposed* vaccine mandates, almost exclusively limited schools. demonstrated even government imposed vaccine mandates require way opt religious reasons. would follow private businesses, required respect religious beliefs anywhere near extent government provide exemption either.

Edit: Sorry, talking shifting goalposts. thought responding someone else. think point still stands pretty well. coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused SARS-CoV-2 creating tremendous human suffering. date, effective drug available directly treat disease. search drug COVID-19, performed high-throughput X-ray crystallographic screen two repurposing drug libraries SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), essential viral replication. contrast commonly applied X-ray fragment screening experiments molecules low complexity, screen tested already approved drugs drugs clinical trials. three-dimensional protein structures, identified 37 compounds bind Mpro. subsequent cell-based viral reduction assays, one peptidomimetic six non-peptidic compounds showed antiviral activity non-toxic concentrations. **We identified two allosteric binding sites representing attractive targets drug development SARS-CoV-2**. forget tasty doorknobs. right matter many people want downvote you. Yeah remember getting immunization card international travel submit doctor's records schools. sure little cards give clinics would qualify. mean someone wanted could print card stock.

I think period time people vaccinate others within US going relatively short. might instead restrict travel certain countries. enough people vaccinated, even matter. sure ever gain traction. cool, doubt go rapidly becoming almost impossible vaccine phase 3 trial.... Ahhh gotcha lol sorry sarcasm detector morning haha  Umm Exactly this. think people realize many things second thought far, far likely get hurt killed.

If took even five seconds address every 1 10,000 chance getting sick, hurt, killed, we'd time anything except disinfect everything.

There's good sane level caution people taking there's senselessly turning bubble boy Seinfeld. Tests widely available Depends. 


In UK opening soon pretty much vulnerable protected. means infections amongst young unvaccinated people likely go lot next 3-4 months chances getting virus may actually quite high. 


Now yes young person unlikely die go hospital COVID chances persisting long term effects infection actually pretty reasonable, certainly somewhere 1 10 1 100. 


In case quicker get vaccine reduce chance better. aren't. 

That isnt viable approach anymore. 

We new vaccine tech mrna model, works, able rapidly revised rolled out, simply accept losses rollouts vaccine eluding variant poses. 

Every 1% unemployment causes ~40k deaths sources. Covid deaths down, vaccines, hospitals developed better treatment protocols, definitive point harm lockdown measures meets exceeds harm virus. Viral deaths trending downwards, loss life economic depression remain constant, effect life-years left would succumb covid. believe either lying, incorrect, misspeaking. single state one 55 get vaccine. 

If sincerely believe one 55 state get vaccine would suggest looking again. LOL, thats pretty solid ""Fuck No"" me. ""If"" apparently really difficult word. friend mine even posted video Dr Fauci speaking claimed ""see even Dr Fauci thinks reopen schools"". watched video sure enough, Dr Fauci said, ""we reopen schools, if"" listed set conditions low community spread. know selective hearing powerful, people obtuse, people stupid understand word ""IF"". standard means like work/school/travel? works vaccines.

Why need something checked everywhere go? feels like invasive solution something achieved means already use. among early vaccinated cohort, assume mainly elderly vulnerable, three deaths 200 infections really positive result.

If among later vaccinated groups, effectiveness may fully kicked yet.

Edit: yeah, looks like least two three died within three weeks getting vaccinated, (given time takes progress stages) suggests infected basically IMMEDIATELY shot even it, well kind protection.  anyone Jersey still looking appointments, saw person Twitter posting: There’s guy thread talking either quarantines food garage 3-4 days touching it. people truly lost reason. glad said this. thrilled people spot bullshit claims.  would use CVS website start plugging zip codes around midnight so.

Got moderna vaccine yesterday arm KILLING me. can't really use intensely painful. weird side effect. Well said. things true. AZ botch trial shitty design vaccines still well worth risk.

anti vaxxers licking lips headline need hear this. great future society use protect deficient now? think that’s importance masks safety measures now. It’s AUS also manufacturing AZ locally. No, probably not.  Except course done anything sort yet. speculation, fear, uncertainty doubt. 

This anti vax delight. Vaccines dont prevent 100% infection, death reports long term effects overblown affecting kids. going cripple generation kids. largely unaffected. Schools places employment already require certain vaccinations. Even US domestic air travel requires (well, Oct 2021) federally issued ID REAL ID part tied driver's license, requires background check. Part could vaccination records. Public gathering spots could use type identification COVID vaccinated identifier ID.

That said think overly extreme measure. Especially since COVID vaccines readily available anyone virus spread significant decline next months. COVID variants became significant issue (which seems unlikely), could see something like happening, otherwise yes, wasted effort. ""vaccine passport"" thing extremely unfair. Say one 20 year olds... take 30 million chance getting bad side effects a) reduce chances getting passing Covid b) mess around testing get life.

Limiting access venues vaccinated increase attractiveness vaccination since many people ""vaccine shy."" Look numbers.  mention officers US probably think covids hoax problem rare reaction shows days week vaccination, easy miss cases reporting. doctors aware it, pay attention. statistics low sample size large margin error. Therefore know one million. 

For example case Norway 130.000 people got AstraZeneca vaccine least three people died blot clots, young: lot consider young people rarely die Covid therefore shifts risk/reward ratio vaccine considerably, Norway decided continue vaccinating AZ now. 

So even rare side effect important study get better idea frequently occurs weight risk/reward depending age group. someone 5 9 year old makes happy!!! think people need start realizing rare risks are, especially vs risks take already accept issue (e.g. contraceptive pill) Texas suffered far infection death earlier waves. vaccine plus previous infections, simply fewer people virus infect, per capita, Texas Michigan. didn't. theses cases, vaccines needs risk-free, individual gains small.

For rare cancers, agree you. 

If adenovirus offers possibility treatment, rather purely speculative prevention, cancer common enough, might change balance, however.

Like literally flipping switch. feels awful important remember actually sick! South Carolina moving average lower March 1 though? Young people definitely start needing Covid vaccination records attend college school like already diseases. Man, that's risky bet - even near sure thing like this.

On chance lose, what's keeping legs attached waist? generate clicks guests vaccinated. would get sick? nothing Middlesex, Bergen county Hackensack Medical running mega site Metlife Stadium hospital. 

Signed mom Saturday shot scheduled Thursday. think deaths permanent downslope. always focused 80-90% small 15-20% population, largely vaccinated point. vaccines close 100% effective death virus. Cases may bump fatalities move towards zero stay misquoting study flaws setup trials. AZ hard time validating it’s efficacy FDA

“Important study limitations include fact studies prospectively designed establish whether vaccine efficacy would differ dose interval; therefore, post-hoc exploratory findings could biased. limitations participants randomised dosing interval, one four trials double-blind, single-dose recipients self-selected. Furthermore, baseline characteristics single-dose two-dose cohorts substantially different, older median age, higher proportion men non-white participants, smaller proportion health social care workers two-dose cohort single-dose cohort. Also, worth considering whether results would hold widespread circulation transmissible lethal viral variants.”

Giving misinformation dangerous Moderna trial put health risk could vaccines. time alive. Optimism strong can’t understand reality. Weren’t claiming day going run oxygen? How’s going. I'm healthy 40, think I'm going wait years take Covid vaccine. Reading article doctor provide evidence claims peole wait complete procedure UK alone, COVID-19 killed hundreds people 30.

There 27 women younger 30 years (77 &lt;40 years) died covid Germany far.

There ~510000 infections women &lt; 35 years Germany. 

Unfortunately can't quickly find dataset matching age groups, even conservative estimate (deaths amongst women &lt;40yo, infections &lt;35 yo) get 

77/510000=.00015

Data:   Yeah probably nail coffin AZ. I'm expecting EU completely dropping summer Medical workers significant enough portion population achieve herd immunity own. sure think that's relevant, unless fishing personal information.

Please stop asking personal information already refused answer before, thanks. need ID covid vaccine. one glad Abbott banned even though may never become thing. got vaccine need flashy card saying look got covid shot. Like f garbage Oh yes, never break ICU waves, it’s long year way get exemption California medical exemption, they're even starting crack that: Stupid question would happen one get three covid vaccines? didn’t say schools. However, get religious exemption still participate society. point 100% irrelevant think you’ll fine. may feel little unwell, won’t like incapacitated anything Fair, seems like able post meh. Bill Rights cancel culture cool. fact, I'd say there's cancel culture everything law. They're getting doses Europe right? Kind surprising EU allowing many exports Canada vaccinating many residents. weigh well, think clear one use vaccine, lot variables consider Everyone mother know NJ found comorbidity get vaccine. example, BMI 25, get vaccine. That's like 70% population. super dumb pretty arbitrary. right thing IMO Thankfully current company liking new WFH staying. Employees happy productive makes management happy. fictional person risk death anyway said fictional person either get shot sake society go hide mountains over. obviously don’t give two shits right discriminated against. I’m surprised. I’m guessing you’d okay companies denying service gay disabled people wouldn’t you? Public schools require available school age kids. can't attend public schools universities without required vaccinations already. Please try register non-immunocompromised child kindergarten without vaccinations report back.  Vaccine must eligible 18+ April 19 rather May 1 now. pair second factor. NY State one name/DOB it. Presumably, I'll show sort ID match.

Yeah, get fake ones, likely bit bother likely worth types things able (i.e., ticket NY Nets game, winning Powerball ticket). Also, faking government ID brings different set legal issues get caught.

It perfect. deter worthwhile level.

On different value level, consider free donut Krispy Kreme. That's flashing vaccination card, trivially faked. that's donut, tickets NY Nets game. It'd dumb Krispy Kreme require higher level authentication. Indeed. bet deaths people travelling vaccination getting accident blood clots even sure directly linked. 

If people refuse vaccines 7 clots per 35 million jabs certainly never leave house, eat food, run bath, DIY etc etc say concerned health fellow americans, course am. Get vaccine stay inside feel safe come out. agree want disagree fundamentals terms opening up. sweat all, people disagree cool lol ain't mad hope stay safe well Supposedly May 1st deadline states open April 17th. I'm saying need eradicate virus completely. never 100% risk. yet point risk similar flu, measles etc. 

In opinion, crossed finish line people want vaccine able get one. Yes, living pandemic going impact mental health. Mental health issues rampant people unemployment homeless pandemic. may prevalent now. also prevalent number kids lost parent. 

If believe vaccines effective, could long past time open people vaccinated yet? think saying high risk people protected. might want take look younger populations requiring hospitalization current case rates. Additionally, hope prepared support people PAS-C unable return work need long term treatment. cases people be. 

Could address people still working yet vaccinated would unable reduce risk work place? Maybe page thinking. definition ""people safe responsible""? mitigation measures think would responsible talking opening things up?

I optimistic going prematurely acting like could really derail us all. Also got yesterday experiencing thing. grateful vaccinated side effects severe me. like basically authority US seriously proposed vaccine passports, people banning anyways idk remember child get vaccines allowed go school. also military pump arm full drugs kept track recorded GASP government.

Common stuff life somehow crisis people. get it. like folks worried government spying every move carry cell phone shows every second every day. get internet ISP track sites go to, Google tracks search for, FaceBook knows mothers fine?

People weird. Thanks pointing out. title verges misinformation, opinion. LOL. need ID travel, pick prescription pharmacy, lots business uses. need membership card gyms. show ID (or ""papers"" will) whenever stopped police. Requiring documentation legitimate purposes make us police state.

What get many basic freedoms already stripped away pandemic. yet people oppose step towards restoring freedoms involves kind restriction. rather 0% 90% freedom. contradicts previous report interview EMA official appeared claim ‘clear link’ AZ vaccine blood clots. I've missed theaters restaurants, I'm stepping foot one while. Need look drive-in. shame talked white church leaders doing. Ignoring black church leaders whose members also lot hesitancy.

Generally speaking, reason people white evangelical churches black evangelical churches would hesitant vaccines come *very* different reasons. HPV infection cause penile, anal oropharyngeal cancer men. vaccine prevents those. argument vaccinating men medical one, argument cost effectiveness.

And say HPV vaccination small individual gains. HPV induced cervical cancer second frequent type cancer women developing countries effective screening/vaccination programmes. actually lower expected, I'm glad hear it. know read chances low several months ago, stopped worry touch washing surfaces. Even though cases going rise think less people die many elderly vaccinated. 55% fully vaccinated 75% one shot. don’t think it’s going bad people think. haha thats assumed lol spring break Good Friday Easter last week, might wise wait another week declaring new plateau. lot poor countries even bad covid problems. also people shaming others wearing mask even they're vaccinated. areas social circles continue mask pressure while, annoying.

Once I'm fully vaccinated I'm threat! Seriously, people need mind business. point fewer young women died covid vaccine.

Source? Germany approx. 5.7 million 80+, 4.8 million received first doses according RKI (some age groups might included). leaves around 18 million 60-79. group offered AZ, see promised AZ supply would even sufficient vaccinate whole group. Beyond June we'll enough supplies vaccines.

This 60+ generation believes doctors newspapers. doctors say safe they'll take without much hesitations. AZ also banned younger groups got first doses, lot take second doses mixing vaccines studied yet, first doses created much problems.  course. think whatever please. see, thanks clarifying can’t imagine they’ll force patient keep it’s injuring labor mean vaccine date? Thanks! Yeah ""Trust"" experts constantly wrong never agree other. Sure worth risking taking vaccine getting corona healthy individual. admit wrong? ELI5: Virus may go boom put square block square hole. People don’t read stories, read headlines regurgitated every single local news outlet across country. can't necessarily tell outcome later happening now. seasonally part reason. example, well seasons change. vaccinations might much effect time, another example. Nice opened. Correct, common vaccine used developing nations actually #1 source poliovirus world right now. Since discovered they've slowly transitioning dead virus vaccine, much expensive live virus one much easier transport store, even though cases coming vaccine, benefits still definitely outweigh risks. think need emphasize return NORMAL life (no masks, restrictions more) reach vaccination goals. Even colleges requiring vaccine still require masks, distancing surveillance testing, seems. feeds belief even vaccine isn’t good enough anyone. seems like PSAs vaccine either really cheesy (I saw one last week TV “this arm power” really corny, first dose last week!) news keeps pumping headlines like “concerning images”, “scary variants” making vaccine progress seem secondary something shouldn’t care about.

I heard one PSA radio last week saying can’t let guard masks down. People going tire hearing that, haven’t already. Part living society sometimes rules don’t like. majority society agrees it’s gone far society stop it. People died, vaccine game changer. aren’t going continue living isolation respect dead. think right thing Realistically, already did, per-capita. US tested 9x rate Brazil per million people. lot uncaught cases/deaths per-capita Brazil. Username checks out? Honestly sure parody response. Australia non-zero community transmission (I see 5 locally acquired cases last 7 days Australia's dashboard), there's real risk infected Australian traveler gets among un-vaccinated public New Zealand. Probably something like AZ females &lt; 55 fair enough know supply vaccines right big issue. 

Our international airports likely remain closed bit longer expecting (except NZ course). think disagree much want sacrifice health fellow Americans role govt. won’t change mind won’t change mine, Abbott took side one. see benefits way way (more deaths less economic impact strategy) don’t think either us “twisted” different perspectives. Hope loved ones stay healthy. expect reputation AZ go down.

All rich countries move away successful bringing UK deaths still role play poorer countries also richer countries still waiting mRNA. Considering states aren’t mandating vaccine passports anyway, it’s solution nonexistent problem. population gets vaccine. believe shouldn’t wear mask anymore, people believe otherwise. Depending vaccine get, get full protection hard effects covid like going hospital Intensive care unit. It’s still possible test positive even vaccine protected dangerous effects covid Please hurt British feelings! mean contest. However, contest us virus, amongst governments. Why? old person would risk getting actual virus instead vaccine 0.0000004% chance giving blood clot, btw 100% fatal? would take chances vaccine day week. Yes no. depends age gender. 20-30 age range germany incredible deaths due covid (&lt;50) handful clotting deaths. almost comparable risk! Especially considering entirely healthy women dropping dead vaccine, young people dying covid likely lots risk factors. glad decided risk worth you. Young women 100% terrible risk benefit issue given choice vaccine healthcare worker. one ethically offer AZ young women. insulting safe alternatives available. Glad got it. Anyone turning vaccine fucking idiot. example assumes balanced coin.  Time non competitively inhibit scallwag agree. Forget covid, think men regularly use bathroom wash hands. I'd say least 70% wash #1 #2 bathroom. alone reason enough wash hands. one reason I've long hated shaking hands folks cold flu season - know sneezed hand wiped nose hand. I'm honestly really surprised Google putting ad like that. gives hope. cleaned groceries bit pandemic I'm handwasher. work grocery seen dirty everything is. Surely conclusion looking results reverse. Tiny number clots across huge number vaccines, compare UK's control covid currently daily deaths/hospitalisations countries slow vaccinate. 

All life valuable, sometimes sacrifice save many. (Caveat AZ may yet perfectly safe). Defo anti-wax pfizers injectect january. keep mind non previous pandemics vaccines. Covid-19 stay like influenca lose power time flies. People allready antibodies disease previous coronaviruses number estimated allmost 60% studiet T-cell antiboidies change fact 100% legal businesses require that. Since (in US, least) question government allowing businesses ask proof vaccination government banning businesses so, I'd take option least government overreach. I'm jsing, think right thing far. already implemented could part Real ID system. one additional check box. Ehh... I'm still gonna clean groceries touch Amazon purchases three weeks extra *extra* safe.

Ill stick 3M respirator actually care much, thanks. least know actually works. officially announced it. 3pm hour EST. I’m sure anti-vaccine passport (for domestic use) confused solely “anti-vax” talking point

Every time try express concerns people say “why don’t want get vaccinated” “this sub taken anti-vaxxers” Yeah, people still don’t understand young people likely die COVID without vaccine get blood clot AZ. It’s risk assessment. !Remindme 1 month.

We'll see happens. Public mask wearing herd immunity levels (including under-16 portion population!) entirely reasonable.

Restrictions large public gatherings people close proximity (restaurants, sports stadiums) achieved also reasonable.

Mask wearing people suffering flu flu-like symptoms public spaces indoors something Americans never done, probably start. One side effect mask wearing gone past year big drop seasonal flu, result could carried forward making habit circumstances.

What would trolling favor of? suspect lobbyist Big Mask something?

The danger premature ""let's reopen, spring, things great"" dovetails directly segments population considered virus hoax least willing publicly endorse position, emphasized restrictions abridgments personal freedoms unacceptable goal-- public welfare-- concept recognized importance of.

Every single one threads see contains mix vague optimism repetition disinformation-- vaccinated can't contract virus, can't spread it, young otherwise healthy people risk, we're already herd immunity X weeks. attitude led politicians many states relax restrictions prematurely several times pandemic, resulted surges every single time.

The number new daily cases HIGHER July. number people going die, to, restrictions relaxed LAST spring, now. cases went time keep restrictions spread got low possible. many states this, instead opting open cause resurgence.

The latest surge met vaccinations catching up, *in gap then* people get sick die. 

The logical response eventual full vaccination hold course happens, throw masks away reopen schools restaurants people feel odds favor among thousands die predictable result policy. You’re forced give up. 

If choose to, eat across street anti vax crowd. 

So freedoms ripped grasp? I’m sure AZ vaccine still efficient tool fighting COVID. 

Considering there's 44 cases blood clotting millions vaccinated... Sweden’s population much healthier significantly less obese population USA, we’re honest. government banning government infringing rights. isn’t cancel culture anymore Bill Rights cancel culture. Abbott banned mandatory vaccine passports “emergency use” covid vaccines. Nothing implies it’s permanent ban. ""Well rangers suck bad Corona even wanna go""  People EU spent last year smugly looking hundreds thousands Americans Brits dying COVID reassuring government far superior.

Now US UK brute forcing end pandemic nation vaccinations, Europe stares another wave lockdowns real possibility another lost year, losing minds. It’s quite frankly little insulting see people basically wish mass death neighbors local government decided reopen. reaction vaccine bad, people absolutely refusing listen medical professionals raising alarm bells means yet another misstep EU ability end pandemic.  Last checked research best guess fully vaccinated people infected 90% less likely infect others unvaccinated infected person. would recommend go get second dose unless become symptomatic, likelihood could infected low. don’t need zero risk live life. drive car. mountain bike. snowboard... Vaccination good enough. It’s like wearing seatbelt helmet. can’t make everyone wear seatbelt wear helmet. aren’t vaccinated, continue practice social distancing, etc. continue wear mask public, respect workers anything. can’t go life verifying data. point trust experts field. can’t experts everything.

So trust verify *not* workable change job it. retirement benefits good otherwise impacted, switching anything else point I'd take big pay cut I'd lucky enough find new job. stressful, know situation permanent long term better wait storm. UK's schedule earliest full reopening i.e. lockdown rules lifted going 21st June. cannot see foreign holidays allowed date. trying determine connection someone's vaccine skepticism political affiliation stupid fuck ignores real symptoms virus skepticism.

Correlation≠causation So, AstraZeneca trial vaccine. unblinded, apparently got vaccine back December. Now, problems AstraZeneca vaccine going doubt officially approved emergency authorization United States.  
The trial technically “ends” June 6 month blood results.  
I think going get jab one approved vaccines little past June safe job requirements/school requirements requires vaccine. doubt note research facility letterhead going slide.  
Am sort reasonable train thought going crazy here? Paywall: ‘Let start saying this: actually support vaccine passports. I’ve yellow fever jab proudly tuck dog-eared, mustard-coloured certificate passport wherever go. 

If Thai government made Japanese Encephalitis jab essential travel country, I’d gladly get injection pack certificate jetting Bangkok. I’m vaccinating dangerous diseases, don’t mind present proof. 

But coronavirus vaccine passport system international travel (or way reducing restrictions fully vaccinated travellers) Government could announcing today would ones one thing: create large-scale inequality and, frankly, I’m angry.

Under new rules, it’s expected two vaccinations need fewer tests may even self-isolate return destination. means granny could well holiday Grenada mum might able swan Maldives, without care world (just holidays be), us still waiting vaccinated – young adults UK – left expensive set restrictions “green” destinations.

With cost two private tests – required anyone returning UK right – sitting £160 £250, without vaccination we’re financially penalised simply young. Even cheaper testing goes ahead planned, we’d still isolate arriving UK “amber list” countries vaccinated travellers might hook. generation debt, little job security less wealth parents, feels entirely unfair. 

Call entitled, will, people even younger A-level results botched bumbling government they’ve missed many important life experiences sacrifices made protect elderly vulnerable, it’s hard angry. They’re paying full whack university courses largely delivered online, opportunities gap years, study abroad programs simple things like making new friends curtailed lockdowns arguably avoidable. certainly feels like young people paying price older generations continue enjoy lives.

Of course, young people probably choose travel abroad don’t want cannot afford extra costs along 10-day self isolation period. – including – travel work new system makes entirely untenable. travel writer cannot travel, I’m good useless editors Telegraph, paying bills I’ve done last decade feels almost impossible. 

Don’t get wrong. desperate return international travel welcome borders reopening 17 May – industry needs desperately – feel must done way doesn’t perpetuate rift young older. 

But perhaps I’m bitter. sting feels particularly raw me, almost exactly year ago sold body science Jenner Vaccine Centre Oxford could develop drug get us mess. could see vaccine going way travel industry would get back business usual, rolled sleeve got jabbed mystery drug, hoping vaccine approved I’d told I’m immune could hit road go back work.

As turns out, booster jab August participation trial extended, means won’t find drug (the real thing placebo) later year. am, possibly vaccinated unable travel job signed save months ago – unless £160+ 10 days shut away home almost every trip. Forgive seem little disgruntled.’

Interesting point brought might impact social relations future. mean odds incredibly high won’t die hospitalized get you’re young, general sentiment millions at-risk people (old, medical workers, at-risk conditions etc) countries need 18-year-old healthy American. That's need federal government step require vaccine passport many things essentially forces states comply.

EMA also knows effect findings be, want absolutely certain. Labor protections wouldn’t anything fix that. easily make valid legal business case it’s unnecessary hire someone lives 1500 miles away home office go qualified local candidate. Yes you. You’ve peddling around anti Vax rhetoric thread months, talking “if part, need get vaccinated.” weren’t anti vaxx already vaccinated, would care wouldn’t effect you? alternative re-open may result people protesting breaking rules anyway (see: Europe).

When think re-open? Please stop comparing blood clots brain suspected related astrazeneca vaccine blood clots birth control. Though involves blood clots, condition. nevertheless try comparison birth control pills, since question raised: lot young women Norway birth control, however death rate low. source data, [but article (Norwegian analogue BBC) states according Norwegian Medicines Agency, 78 women got blood clots birth control last 10 years. 78, 2 women died. article also states even 2 cases causation clear underlying conditions used form birth control pill without estrogen. 

In comparison, 3 women died receiving astrazeneca vaccine year. correlation death rate higher astrazeneca vaccine birth control pills. know many women birth control pills Norway last 10 years, suspect number higher number people vaccinated astrazeneca vaccine.

The last report could find stating death rate people infected covid-19 Norway [December 2020](). age group 20 - 39 years old, risk dying infected covid-19 0,0029 %. Norway vaccinated 121 820 people astrazeneca vaccine, 3 people age group 20 - 39 years old died. know many vaccinated age group 20 - 39 years old, even given were, death rate would similar (0,0024 %). none people died vaccination known underlying conditions.

These simple calculations, medical education, think fair say understandable Norway halted vaccination astrazeneca based numbers. situation may different countries. However, matter look it, chances high people dead would alive take vaccine. may words sacrificing save others. Maybe saved higher level vaccination population get sick vaccine, people, makes difficult ethical dilemma. Maybe think since thousands dying day right now, something stops deaths totally may side effect impacts handful people worth it. Serious question: think stop requiring children provide proof (non-COVID) vaccination enrolling public schools? immigrants required provide proof Polio, Hepatitis, measles vaccines able enter country without proof vaccination? canada? lives! I'm well. 2 weeks post 2nd shot things looking good. year plus later, everyones opinion Swedens COVID response? Well makes sense stuff life

Right, things becoming common. slow erosion, need jump hoops order participate society way. need less this, more.

What described exactly slippery slope looks like. interact public strangers? go grocery store? town, state, 90% immunized already?

Low risk zero. 

So saying is, low chance could get virus, low chance could transmit it, get sick die, circle probably get sick die. Everything wrote yourself-- followed rules, responsible, got vaccinated, risk. 

Someone else might, care.

Your mask protect you. protect others. mask protect me. protect everyone around me. That's people vaccinated urged keep wearing masks, continuing wear one situations public even I'm vaccinated spread actually stops. majority people US still even single shot, people cannot age medical exemptions. 70+ German social distancing routine kept healthy past 12 months, would book appointment literally gambler's give dangerous advice like this.

I'm sorry, gambler's fallacy. I'm sitting around house, interacting anybody, chance becoming sick people work office, take public transport meet friends. decide low enough likelihood contracting COVID ""gamble"" add 3 weeks 55 weeks I've already spent social isolation means receive better vaccine. However, even full picture. AZ B/P fully effective second dose. second dose AZ administered 12 weeks, second dose B/P administered 6 weeks. short, even waited 3 weeks B/P vaccine, I'd fully immunized 3 weeks earlier AZ. 

From everything know far, B/P better vaccine AZ. B/P, receive second dose faster, effective variants like SA one, known significant side effects studies riddled issues like AZ's studies were.

Regardless factors, would personally take AZ vaccine offered today. age, I'm months away receiving vaccine according official schedule I'd appreciate benefits vaccine could offer me. situation simply different someone 70+ self isolating year able get B/P within month. Remember aids crisis people afraid touch gay people? remember. You’re literally treating people like lepers....and case they’re probably healthy. We’ve never ends well. EMA denied conclusion anyway per Guardian reported, looks like jumped statement Agence France-Presse, European Medicines Agency (EMA) said Tuesday “not yet reached conclusion review currently ongoing,” adding expected announce findings Wednesday Thursday.

Source: link take look. necessarily saying link EMA yet reached conclusion. Thank you! Nationwide, uptick number hospitalized Covid-19 patients subtle, large divergence age group: clear recent increase coronavirus hospital admissions among adults 50. among oldest age groups, likely vaccinated already, admissions continue decline AZ delivered around 22 million doses EU (of around 100 million promised Q1). clear yet rare exactly side effects rare side effects often unreported cases. Norway 3 people died 130.000 got AZ vaccine, that's rare anymore . UK far less cases reported. decided put hold: better understand frequent condition really is. Fatalities virus decline 80-90% population vaccinated (and Israel seen already). fatality rate covid constantly revised downwards throughout pandemic around 0.25%. Reduce 90% 0.025%, probably still concentrated group. younger healthier probably 1/10 1/100 that. point risk par many viruses illnesses.

Hospitalizations quite concentrated, *rate* much higher population, cases 30-60 age range hospitalizations. hospitalization fatality fully recover, especially treatments get better. vulnerable people age bracket also vaccinated.

If we're talking virus 1 100,000 chance killing healthy person otherwise treatable doctors hospitals, opinion game over. reopen deal consequences virus much less consequences lockdown.

If states opening vaccinations adults (they within 2 weeks), demand must dropping among early groups, means either vaccinated, ones willing vaccinated it. someone work situation need vaccinated, chance. refuse take vaccine, point problem. strongly suspect lot people situation like grocery store workers long since exposed virus anyway.

And opinion applies teachers too. simple solution schools vaccinate teachers staff let families opt in. teacher refuses get vaccinated, can't keep entire school, school system, closed. teacher needs sub administrative leave something. family want send kids school situation home fine, let families send kids school. Keeping kids home major hardship. basis view? acknowledge risk long-covid asymptomatic spread? agree US likely mirroring UK, Israel countries greater proportion cases younger cohorts less likely hospitalized die?

Personally, family totally locked since last March, ordering groceries food, going anything indoors seeing people outside. kids done virtual school. wife vaccinated ready go stores, outdoor dining activities like avoid anyone without mask. rates drop low enough, ready reopen fully. Microsoft 160k employees. cutting ceo salary 10 million means pay employee $62.5 Canada giving AZ anyone 55 right now. live, many highest priority people got vaccines AZ started arriving here. would include under-55s eligible far, mainly care home workers rather small proportion health care workers.

They knew last line signed contract. grandstanding shift blame publicly state still 55+? Rather im 50, u prob thinking «america first» Global suppression literally impossible, even USA wants Chinese style lock-downs, BILLIONS people developing world luxury (they literally starve), covid continue spread there. Local governments countries resources power organization lock areas either...so there's way transfer money make work. 

Mods honestly delete article fucking stupid. Yeah aren’t vaccinated special color coordinated section them. signs say “coloreds only” something like that....oh wait. go get groceries. risk COVID definitely higher zero. didn’t get QR code vaccine paper, it’s handwritten. think depends people want take vaccine forced, least Europe UK.

That's nebulous term hard get read they're actually complaining about. 

There's lot evangelical christians. monolith. 

From 1000 feet seems like dog whistle targeting white christian people south. said, evangelicalism monolith. There's plenty black/latin/asian evangelical christians well, mostly located south. target southerners general? understand passport internationally since course countries concerned keeping citizens healthy tests less reliable proof vaccination. Domestically don’t get it. mandates assume fully FDA licensed vaccine? vaccines still EUA status covered, too? know hundreds/thousands college aged people covid heard single one compare long term symptoms. untrue fear mongering Exactly. still wear indoors required, that's gone, I'll stop wearing altogether. even close.

The US properly secured thier vaccine supply rolling ever increasing rate. country already planning opening vaccines everyone week.

Ths EU screwed thier shenanigans shifting blame AZ, believe thied spin bullshit. Brussel's fault, AZ's. actually know retail chain like Rite Aid automatically schedule second dose location. bet cancel hope book second dose elsewhere someonedon't die mean suffer. Talk long hauler. reopening based bored people are? wont use digital passport. know tons people wont use digital passports.  run problems crap.  need scrap passport bullshit. Agreed general, room hybrid approach.

If (and saying true, hypothetical) find risk rare blood clot subset population near subset's Covid death risk, might make sense move subset another vaccine.

I think anyone credible saying stop vaccinating altogether.

To pro-science means open changing one's approach problem light new data. Nope. okay businesses responding choices people make. choose get vaccine consequences fault. things described uncontrollable traits. Wow, banning virtual concerts 4 weeks? Guess citizens don’t “rights” government doesn’t grant us... EMA trying 160% sure results. Pretty sure official know general opinion there. ses british defense league doesnt sleep. push goalposts death. First bullshit, conspiracy, later ""why uk"" cases. Every time end wrong side argument push next one. Fair enough. AZ could statistically significant issues place could still bunch health expert coplayers rejecting negative news. 

I say though negative news abundance days, dont blame people trying find light focusing that, especially bad news isnt known/confirmed. Literally nothing already given them. Name whether vaccinated plus permission provide info want (as required HIPAA). odds feeling like shit second dose Pfizer? I've got mine coming Friday crossing fingers still weekend. Nope. absolutly untrue. read contract? specifically states AZ may take obligations third parties might undermine contractual shedule. Every source stating something different always based british tabloids. Microban legit, can't speak longevity anything something like doorknob, use trash cans, cutting surfaces know nobody forcing injections, point.. read context? right think it’s bad idea variety reasons. say someone who’s vaccinated already signed 3rd got phonecall last night get one today Hagerstown Premium Outlets. got downvoted linking three different surveys showing ~33% Republicans get vaccinated.

It's super odd. article also says review ongoing...

So still figuring things could ready tomorrow day after. Anyway, damage done. lot people actively refuse AZ vaccine. Same. suspect people go ""anti-vaxxer"" argument bc can't defend vaccine passport otherwise. I'm you. fully support vaccine, REALLY dislike posture ""you better show proof!!!"" Got mine today, receiving phonecall make appointment last night. signed text notifications, pick first. Calling back took literal hour get through, probably pick get phonecall unknown number. think vaccines 100% safe. better alternative rolling dice covid. I’m someone leery AZ vaccine, I’m cautious, social distancing, wearing mask, etc., I’d wait extra week. that’s me. public health perspective, know that’s wrong advice. personal standpoint though? make decision.

It bad advice public health perspective bad decision yourself. Postponing vaccination even hours poses far greater risk health adverse effects AZ vaccine, even practice social distancing wear mask etc. greatly underestimate deadly COVID greatly overestimate dangerous AZ is. happened ""Trust Experts™?"" kind sad journalism come speed matters major corrections simply edited later.

Read news early? Oops, misinformed. EU gets lowest priority. EU accepted lower cost per dose. think part you’re missing potential liability business afraid assuming require vaccines. 

I suspect businesses care little would prefer sued employee employee B’s vaccination status. even talking about? conflating vaccine production shipment injection? even read comment initially responded to? production, rollout. Also I'm American, even immediate leap vaccine nationalism sad.  ok tech company SF might consider someone remote Idaho top option regardless resume.

Which need labor protections still stand claim. Actually made cotton flax. However, all states need comply October 1, 2021. feelings thoughts issue irrelevant. bet 90% flu shots vaccines diseases. nothing god. plain old stubbornness thinking getting shot lets liberals win. Lockdown last resort needs highly effective short. Europeans treat lockdowns like new normal months months end. Businesses used able refuse service black, gay disabled people. used argument. guess you’re cool then? Luckily, attempted suicides up, calls mental health help lines up, substance abuse up, domestic abuse up. Yes data support all, work cant bothered link all. EU lowest priority last order, insisted lower price per dose.

The EU knew placed order. behind, gotten EU yet. want blame someone, start Brussels. people know (including myself) vaccinated. low risk circle transmitting virus low risk severe outcome. followed rules 12 months. weren’t responsible dead. got vaccinated. ready live normal life. assume give details interview, official EMA statement, says expected coming days.

There research groups Germany Norway claim found vaccine causes rare clots course science evolving every day there's probably still much learned. Here's preprint case interested: thing happened Isreal. Things plateau bit re-opening slightly outpace vaccination. end mattering, Memorial Day mostly normal. post think moderna shot given protect variants? Nobody? Per [one cdc cited Twenty-nine 348 (8.3 %) surface samples positive SARS-CoV-2, including crosswalk buttons, trash handles, door handles essential business entrances (grocery store, liquor store, bank, gas station). 

Pre pandemic lot city walking, wouldn’t surprised touched hundred contaminated surfaces every months followed normal routine. 

Like said, unimportant compared aerosols, risk higher suggesting. problem without mandate, lot people motivation wear mask. lot people, especially Texas, wear mask law required them. Texas feared going cause spike cases everybody going ""I wear mask anymore"" time businesses started opening back up.

People reddit might likely take measures protect themselves, know lot people Texas almost never choose wear mask unless mandated to. lifting mandate, seeming like opening potential lot spread since many people state everything possible prevent kind spreading. texit already. Good riddance. One countries complex economy earth, small (population wise) chinese mining outpost. 0 ers don’t want believe sort nuance. want angry scared want impose everyone else they’re afraid. lot people hesitant take dumbasses think MMR vaccine causes autism.

For plenty people, benefit immunization outweigh risk taking experimental drug. yep, Chicago. Whatever stance anything, one thing would hope everybody agree thread akin rat roasted dumpster fire anything else media won’t tell us that. come Doomsday Scenario scare people clicking headlines. clicks = $$$. Right. And? Chicago Philadelphia guess? almost like someone bad/misleading/outright misinformation, it? Mostly safe vaccines  Even though would never died covid. 

Take deep breath rational. 

The chances dying covid adult 1/1000 approx. 

The chance getting clot 1/300000 Adorable Fauci, take account. again, propaganda numbers met.

I wonder many countries local governments fake vaccine numbers. *Ruh roh* EMA rejected claim article redirects Good. plenty people would happily take job anti vaxxer. No... EU screwed vaccine rollout backing (and waiting) honengrown EU vaccine could control, failed billions euros contracts manufacturers.

The EU knows literally last table last delivery priority list. AZ (and others) told placed thier order..

Yet continues play games, grand stand,.and blame AZ thier gross incompetence. see point evaluate risk - I’m age group would problem, work home husband, kids online school go groceries. risk minimal right feel I’m willing wait get another manufacturer. understand feeds vaccine avoidance I’m willing take chance death covid chances right almost 0. believe EMA rejected claim officially, article redirects submission linking newsweek.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Yes read sorry believing someone reputation. I’ll believe proves LINK CAUSATION. point, ones showed caused, numbers many blood clots whole debate AZ vaccines totally crazy. Firstly decided vaccinate younger people only, sudden AZ good younger people, given elderly. switch really came moon. one day whole contradiction made. even know AZ safe elderly, tested enough age group come facts? No, think so. elderly tested see AZ safe them. 

Another thing due crazy statements many countries going stop vaccinating younger people AZ. us got first dose AZ going able get second dose AZ, likely. personally would feel safer get second shot company different one! yet test possibility mixing different brands vaccines. putting us younger people constant stress uncertainty what? number people developed blood clots compared total vaccinated population AZ 0.00001% so? say covid virus causes frequent blood clots people? chances getting blood clots virus regards vaccine cannot compared. AZ vaccine brought death cases? research published UK fact Pfizer lead deaths AZ, nobody talks vaccines side effects. 

Overall smells like huge political campaign AZ UK. shame politics became important actual health people. Yeah. is. Remember business allowed refuse services black, gay disabled people? Yeah. It’s called discrimination. Ffs folks would definitely calling SS Jews hiding. look numbers, EU isn’t badly all. Even drama uncertainty AstraZeneca vaccine, Germany recently jabbing 250,000 people day. one accounts difference population, that’s equivalent country size U.S. vaccinating 1 million day. 

So 1/4 US currently doing? won’t make much money “the world ending” headlines. bloodclots brain one side effects would crossed az/oxford list emergency use authorization vaccines. even rare circumstances.

There's lot people knocking mask usage, definitely see scenarios would wear mask future two years ago. Anyone ever sick vacation knows sucks, wear mask every time go week going vacation? ride subway, definitely see value wearing mask that. Sitting packed auditorium? Maybe I'll wear mask future. I'm sick I'll definitely wear mask go out.

But product like really necessary infrequently I'd use it. Maybe rode public transportation regularly, don't. ask feeling. us still feeling 100%. Meanwhile still felt anything. think I'm clear now. I'll probably get antibody test couple weeks sure lol. Thanks letting know! fomenting unwarranted panic comment. Dumb complaint...one week going harm.  comes public safety vs privacy. personally value public safety willing give things good whole. understand compatible individualism US. think US practices extreme version individualism tbh. well money grow trees.. greater funding equals taxes stealing another underfunded source.. glad think cut dry fuck share evidence instead making press releases. Fuck off. “The case numbers, minuscule, underscore two warnings made consistently public health officials: vaccines provide absolute guarantee getting infection, masks safety protocols remain important vaccinated long pandemic continues rage.” article People want permission excited vaccines excited getting lives back normal. lot messaging comes across preachy borderline demeaning, even that's intention. that’s Astrazeneca says can’t deliver 100 Millionen doses EU nations BLOCK exports: find infinitely frustrating we've got year's worth evidence outdoor spread exceptionally rare, especially typical circumstances like walking street (as opposed standing shoulder-to-shoulder big crowd hours), people still give shit sometimes masking outside.

I'm fully vaccinated recovering pulmonary embolism, tbh really want wear mask *anywhere* since makes harder breathe, definitely want wear one outside getting warm out. Lmao. It’s way massive corporations. Millions Americans involved vaccine rollout. Moderna isn’t even massive corporation. course listen biased media continue thinking it’s due massive corporations. Enjoy AZ vaccine 2023!!! thats thing non passport ideas even mentioned short time.  allow passports wont ever go away.  

i'm away deadly virus thats i'm vaccinated. I've stayed home year everyone else didnt give shit.  i'm vaccinated.  part. fema vaccination card.  government want digital bullshit enter building hold job thats fucking insane... outsourcing become common they're able work home. guess matters company gets financial benefit. screw employee happiness. pulse oximeter handy. blood oxygen level goes less 95%, time check hospital. Higher interest vaccines among previously eligible groups leading extended windows groups. states opened vaccines everyone early huge demand, lower demand among already eligible groups.

AZ sucks. money Pfizer They’re seeing links beliefs COVID-19 falsehoods reliance social media source news information.

This extends covid, big driver lot division world right - people ends political spectrum. 

I understand isn’t covid specific comment, probably get removed, problem using social media news source - read watch third party social media ‘news’ entities, get bombarded *type* news via social media suggested content algorithms, rabbit hole one goes. 

I two friends - one LOVES watching TYT. big fan Daily Wire. via social media. uninformed topic, ever get one side story via social media content bombardment stories targeted them. 

If take book rip half pages, you’ll never understand full story, despite 100% correct words written pages remaining. How/where serious discussion leading decrease states/countries restrictions seeing cases drop. I'm anti-masker, anti-vaxxer, (censored), anything like that.

But here, many platforms, can't seem ask questions without blocked, removed, accused pushing conspiracy theory.

I want compare contrast, Texas, Brazil, Chile, Michigan, Israel, more. models seem assuming vaccines work. models say ""the spike driven people wearing masks"" states, yet places virtually masking cases... hear natural herd immunity would literally impossible without apocalyptical death.

Any recommendation Covid policy skepticism would greatly appreciated. Bonus points comparisons made accounting non-Covid side effects policy, I'd prefer places African lives equal American lives. (in words, increase poverty deaths due Covid reaction considered)

Any resources exist? Dr ZDog seems closest thing I'm looking for, I'd like forum possible. even provided proof 5 states stopped accepting religious/personal exemptions (and least one even cracking improper medical exemptions) said ""well know someone broke law, obviously illegal."" Like, want stay bed sick? Seattle here; people wear masks walking outside solo suburbs. gonna *a while.* chance fatal mouse dropping disease probably much concern garage groceries. people really enjoy pandemic can't stand going away. false Nope. They’re booked atm check times day best hope pharmacy Smokers *and* former smokers. Ever smoked cigarette (even once)? eligible. groups also include anyone living frontline worker. 

At point, eligibility essentially formality - hard part getting appointment Portland area, since still get scooped quickly. hand, willing drive couple hours outside town, pretty much get day next day appointments place. Again, you’re completely missing point. completely forgot trucks picking central warehouse option B adds 1,000,000+ customers driving ways stores, causing traffic much larger carbon footprint everyone roads. Compared 100 trucks delivering 5000 homes less traffic.

Having thing's delivered home like mad transit vs single occupancy vehicles commuting. got 2nd moderna yesterday exact symptoms. Well, there's one thing well United States *moderation*. 

I'm sure soon needed, go away. absolutely expanded things. No, sir. Sorta. depends big group wants is. 

If enough a-holes won’t get expect problems continue. people always clamoring evidence stopped transmission virus, they'd go right around say covid absolutely infallibly certainly undoubtedly assuredly 100% percent going endemic.

So obnoxious. would seem indicate seasonality still affect variants. Here's hoping summer significantly reduced cases, giving us opportunity vaccinate many people possible, get started booster shots tailored variants 65+ crowd. got first dose Moderna hour ago. arm bit sore. things looking for? covid several months ago, possible, covid months afterwards absolutely 0 change hearing experience ringing all. symptoms lasted week experience long-haul issues.

Then, got vaccine immediately developed tinnitus. got side effects well vaccine -- fever, body aches, fatigue, mental fog -- tinnitus onset came along them. Florida half amount testing last year almost 10% positivity. That's ""doing fine."" Florida Texas test lot. sure that's always glossed over. many believe boogeyman? actually feel proud U.S. right now. Thanks Joe. dunno, I'm going touch table 10,000 get back you. also can’t discriminate people health status.

Bullshit. Based disability pregnancy protections, otherwise general health fair game. Even believe cockamamie story would come true, wouldn’t go businesses don’t ask one? single misstep got anti-vax moms marching Washington again.

Ehh, pretty sure they're gonna anyway...  vaccines widely available people time reach full immunity, life able go back pretty much normal long enough people gotten vaccinated. 

Apparently you’re part “f- I've got mine” group already know there’s still huge numbers people vulnerable infection can’t afford get sick hospitalized chance long term health problems it’s big deal you, right?

Edit apparently swearsies allowed add high risk ones vaccinated, completely dependent state, county, availability. Papers, please. mean Canadian like assume based posts every evening, informative must add.

Your post applies Canada probably United States, bringing vaccines right Nice shift attacking anti vaxer. Yea- now, that’s sort thing starts, one thing leads another. Look Patriot Act, expanded FISA courts, unchecked power. Obviously I’m saying proposed vaccine passport become FISA court, analogy rings same. Give little, they’ll take mile Philippines, per article.  posting wrong thread? story Moderna vaccine. part problem. don’t think defeated terrorism that’s something can’t actually defeated. terrorists spring time, problem law it’s likely never going away.

A virus, however, something completely eradicated. We’ve done plenty times before.

A better analogy would asked remember masks went away Spanish Flu outbreak died off. did.

So fully expect stuff like go away Covid outbreak dies off.

Worth thinking EO prevents Texas state government requiring vaccine passport. person would decide whether Texas state government would require one person signed EO. prevented something, nothing meaningful that.

And you’re worried next governor reversing this, well, know it’s easy reverse implement, nothing lasting accomplished. It’s really fearmongering based political theater. Title European Union’s executive arm says member states sufficient vaccine supplies immunize majority people end June, according memo circulated national delegations Brussels seen Bloomberg.

The title sounds like beat Covid-19 end June talking 55% article, sounds realistic. since dug Zune starting listening jams. reach immunity without vaccine. reach immunity one way another.  Rule number 4. can't tell you. Don’t use logic. Lol employers businesses demand vaccine passports therefore cant job walk business without proof. fear mongering. i'm vaccinated wont part this.  wont leave house that's comes to.  doesnt feel right. Im sure you’re trying say 

The results show vaccines China exporting pretty poor products. 

That means terms ending pandemic, aren’t great. isn’t competitor vaccines. fine long get 42nd day would call ask see moved up. viable proof. card useless. meant year. fully hope able kids vaccinated next year. last year shown I'm much extroverted ever thought was. helped understand terms (and much fluctuating spectrum is) better used to.

WA, Arizona, Oregon, Utah, D.C. Press F pay respects P.1 appear less problematic B1.135, find really concerning poor results even wild type virus. realize data already collected app would hit data that’s already there, right?

The thing happening would private businesses ability turn away service. Without kids getting vaccinated many adults skipping vaccine, Covid finished maybe 60% population vaccinated? Genuinely asking, hope I'm wrong right. Ah, true, they've got well! Yes, mean 30 kids allowed schools right? employer continue employment non-vaccinated person's, go city zoo, get airplane.

I agree entirely people choice, bit consequences choice.. parent makes choice responsible home schooling sending kids parent funded private education. Seems like something calming cytokine storms inflammation relief.

Maybe couple most. Ethic gone away last 10 years. come point think something hard enough moral high ground matter what. 

Is fair require vaccine passport 4/15/2021? No, cause everyone can’t get vaccinated create two classes people. (The cleanses unclean) fault unclean literally can’t get vaccinated. creating unethical situation lead covid cases long run. 

Is fair vaccine passport 9/1/2021? Sure people 18. vaccinate passport needed then? Probably since everyone ever gonna get gotten it.

Is even legal passport essential travel? 
This real question addressed government.

What mean FL doesn’t require NY does? fly FL need tk vaccinated come NY? coming home? Could logistics nightmare. 

I don’t support passports domestic travel. Essential activities require form passport. think situations require need people vaccinated. think cases vaccinate verified private prior allowed ticket. situations require vaccination provider provide documentation stating vaccinated goes single person HIPPA trained. keep process situations need everyone tk vaccinated safety. don’t need big brother app phones track us Well, that's course bummer Denmark whomever gets subjected it, still means worldwide every bottle contains 7 usable doses instead 6. Could great news. felt like garbage first Pfizer shot mean wont bad second time around? friend said felt great first one terrible second. hope flip flops depending person. risk transmission much lower vaccinated non-zero. Assuming 1% infection rate 100,000 person unvaccinated population, would expect 1,000 people catch COVID. Assuming 100,000 vaccinated people, would expect 100 people catch (with asymptomatic). It’s big reduction immunity. don’t know whether people catch COVID vaccination risk long COVID, exhibit characteristic glass lungs. know more, continued caution smart course. People work don’t really choice show up. option either open people already vaccinated stay closed months. 

It’s really funny seeing people hell bent everything open suddenly 180 don’t want vaccine. know. Young people still want 2 things: able see older/more vulnerable loved ones life go back normal.

I'm 33, got first round far. Can't wait see parents guilt free. also can't wait go party giant music festivals/concerts.

The latter happen spread seruously dies down. Personal anecdote, friend received multiple notices people close family friends dying sole week. Maybe things Brazil good.

At least kind disaster heard concerning companies open plan offices. salty, may even let come watch Euro2020 nice us Like people enforcing masks? Unknown. They’re common even susceptible groups. main worry adenovirus vector vaccines fundamentally provoke vigorous immune response CVST outcome inevitable (if rare) side effect populations. J&amp;J must crossing fingers!

I think it’ll come accumulation risk factors. Youth + gender + genetics? + tobacco use? + misfortune. failed vaccine primary reason UK low death rate recently? person said additive person arguing against. taking word (likely used simplified manner, strict definition) used someone arguing position... 

And - post *I* weigh definition additive. I'm simply pointing arguing strawmen... fully vaccinated don’t symptoms, shouldn’t need keep testing. CDC already said vaccinated people don’t need quarantine exposure. Continually testing people (like part routine job testing) going keep turning “cases” false positives. False positives even likely seroprevalence low. Yeah 2021 theres excuse anymore Hospitalizations deaths poor metrics. main danger COVID always long-term, diverse symptoms people suffering with.

People vaccinated reason worry. People already reason worry. young healthy non vaccinated people little reason worry. breaks think anything basic living costs. 

For example, SF guy KC guy get wages based cost living. sets aside 15‰ salary savings investments. retire Florida (just example). SF guy 2 million retirement, KC guy 300k. better retirement? don’t give AIDS standing next me. said walked across border said detained. it? detained, either apply asylum deported. statement doesn’t make sense. way get stay asylum granted courts. Failing quite spectacularly everything else  Getting vaccine way better wearing mask. Masks reduce transmission 90%, unless clean N95s worn properly. level incompetence gotten high dont even base decisions timeline

""2-3 weeks, lets see."" Pretty much this. reason Patriot Act still here. TSA still thing. NSA stopped doing.

There's reason think government decide COVID passports done, especially gives detailed list every business every citizen gone to. three important anything else do, first two immediate effects R. Vaccine lags 10-14 days. Vaccination way out. Health measures keep ride smooth. many ignorant morons refuse take make mandatory, though would personally fine removing people general society. Vaccine frontline workers good bro Lifting statewide mandate empowers anti-maskers defy businesses local restrictions. really sends wrong message. Especially Hicksville state like Indiana, probably horrible compliance even state mandate.

The sad thing is, it’s couple weeks Biden’s “I’m asking 100 days.” It’s Rep Governors going way defy him, lift stuff early. That’s exactly reduce cases. encourage people don’t want take vaccine take instead participate society. Many people booked couple months. agree wait go restaurants hope do. people work restaurants, stores, schools etc option wait though. makes sense allow time people fully vaccinated. makes sense wait another month (maybe 2 depending dose availability) everyone wants vaccine time get one build immunity. seems close finish line trying best trip it. 
Additionally, important consider portion population able access vaccines. thought simple leave young kids home? Thank rational this. far many people willing get back type normalcy Covid 100% eradicated. like ""prove putting staff risk."" Honestly, US UK least, government little facilitating checks. us, instance, focusing making way prove vaccinated vaccine cards cut it. Imo gym restaurant cruise ship want unvaccinated people, that's prerogative capitalist society, especially serving unvaccinated people comes nonzero risk cost company. Thousands high risk without context many surfaces contaminated. hell? smart kids. I'm fine vaccine requirements things, want to, sit sidelines miss out. Isn’t significant area “perfect” “complete trash”? actually insane watch this. yelling like bratty children it, like 'their' vaccine shout loud enough problem goes away. Expressing measured concern met downvotes abuse.

I'm British chose AZ thought may Pfizer supply issues, back export argument EU. chose wrong. want second dose seeing Germany recommended people get them. I'm exact demographic problems affect. 

But apparently take one team something. genuinely chilling read dropped dead stroke massive internal bleeding due vaccine, no-one would give shit I'd collateral damage. jobs know people work well home, I’m completely convinced forcing people come back office control power thing. Like, maybe think employees like submit bosses demands higher performance pay hear controlled, miserable, sterile office environment in-person versus online? friends returned work food service industry Michigan (Ann Arbor, Chelsea, Lansing areas).

According CNN, AP, 800,000 (majority male) migrants expected cross 2021. people turned detained. Many others accounted matter daily cases temporarily plateauing, at-risk people vaccinated. plateauing not-at-risk people care much get it.

Even numbers come weeks, though, like Israel. realize laws already exist, right? last sentence applicable thousands years. Yea guess right. require negative covid test? Come on. That's exactly feasible get every time someone wants go somewhere. wasn’t “propaganda”, hypothesis based available evidence, studied produced conclusion confirmed hypothesis. Propaganda implies something completely different - it’s “hypotheses conclusively confirmed empirical studies”. Young healthy woman (healthcare worker) 2nd AZ dose last week. starting feel calmer year stop anxiety getting/spreading covid new thing worry about. wait see official report. saying wrong 'can provide evidence' always red flag take reported large pinch salt. Nothing wrong quarantine restrictions. issue associated $2,000 fine.

Yeah, don’t understand leaders ignored obvious point. I’m sure experts raising flag them. didn’t listen?  still rights. like businesses right refuse service. Nobody forcing get vaccine. Thanks worried read posts mine 3 days! I'll go back waiting see body well, antivaxx propaganda confirmed link.

You change opinion based new facts I'm curious consider full rate? ppl understand what's going on. However, got shot Tübingen (Biontech), told almost noone willing take az anymore. right short stop period.

Now open 60+ know many rush get fast possible. Covid-19 far dangerous older people. give f*ck tiny risks potentially relevant specific conditions. really organize az goes older generations, promising projections summer may hold true. Fully vaccinated able eat inside restaurant first time year- surreal lol first thing noticed super quiet without sort background music. Also, appetite restaurant industry people vaccinated! Texas Florida ok last April, too. dentist's office upgraded airflow ventilation. honest dangerous mentality passing 8x pay raise might lose job get sick need pay pocket ( could savings). 25 years retires much comfortable lifestyle afford stuff keeps nursing home. 

You conservative irrational degree. Higher income well correlated much better health overall. pay level access best everything pass up? No.

40% least one shot something, least another 10% already Covid. actually higher, conservative assuming overlap vaccination. 

The US vaccinate 4-5% country week real world data shows pretty strong immune response two weeks first shot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, going happen. Sitting restaurant thing I've missed plague. 

My workshop permanently ""no customers allowed"" area deliver order car park call. closed offices never open WFH much better everyone involved saves enough rent utilities expenses hire specialist full time employee several degrees. get everything groceries clothes delivered intention setting foot brick mortar store unless absolutely to. That's whole point. want anyways. threatening want do. tell got shot last week. company wanted opposite offices EU apparently EU fairly draconian laws labor practices. company wanted pay stipend people work home regulatory hoops jump guess. Glad got see many experts Reddit past weeks weigh political stunt, saying risk clotting general population! Indeed, DVTs common, CVSTs combination low platelets otherwise healthy young people almost unheard of. German, Austrian, Danish, Norwegian, Italian, French, Canadian scientists call halt something could mitigate impact virus currently ravaging countries without good reason. talking $250k+ Silicon Valley salaries, there's nothing normal them, inflated. People outside SV rarely get $120k, sounds right. Paying $250k everyone would lunacy. connect 5G signal give /s don’t mind that, mind people say “I want go back office, therefore forced go back too”. understood EU blocks export exported country vaccinated EU, everyone honestly encourage sharing vaccines fairly getting pandemic selfish vaccinating looking others. Risk appears different age take total cases divide total vaccinations. appears AZ used many countries persons 60/65. shit. Common sense mean common knowledge. Common sense something understood without special knowledge. late. blocked last response. opinion say it, clear association vaccine. However, still know causes reaction”

Not strong statement headline suggests. AstraZeneca vaccine 100% effective severe disease, hospitalization death. (Analysis phase III trials) Laschet following Söder statements. Hopefully Chancellor State Premiers put sonewhat coherent plan, I'm betting it. There's typical srawman bullshit. would friends someone like that? Try waiting 4 months Canada second shot.  Imagine complaints Walgreens like Canada implementing course. Better business. Irony essentially working home. got part office turned nursery could take care kid worked. UK perspective, affect vaccine drive much. Moderna shipping weeks time, Pfizer continue supply us Novavax around corner too. Maybe J&amp;J (though vaccine similar AZ's?)

Either way, young, healthy person UK, probably better waiting offered one instead AZ. Even though chances developing CVST tiny, risk I'm personally willing take alternatives exist (and also, AZ nothing gigantic PR disaster day 1 quite frankly, reputation completely soured point) UK 31,581,623 first doses (47.28% population

And 5,432,126 second doses (8.13% population).

I think UK ahead EU second doses well. article makes clear though, private businesses dependent travel (airlines/hotels/etc) absolutely need get SOMETHING put place trustworthy enough countries let us in. Thank you! “open-up” cult isn’t going like this. They’ve already hijacked thread Wondering people calling concern vaccine antivax propaganda are... discredits UK acknowledging concerns. Fact matter EU right suspending use among affected population. helps, still functional. could worked, would hated it. Many coworkers virtually reaction second shot.

And feel completely back normal morning, yay! CoRReLaTIoN CAusaTIoN No, could expected outright lie information know—see Fauci team telling people didn’t need wear masks start pandemic. aunt get vaccine today fucking scared think getting side effects thinking it...

Fuck sake. really know say calm her.

My mom getting 2 dose week.

Fuck me. I'm also nervous even though probability low. embarrassment

This big enough word truly describe epic fuckup US handling covid. much medical information giving looking ""Vaccinated: Yes/No?"" Oh probably name address confirm it, already provided buying tickets. It’s another point. Stop defending false point. kidding. That’s vaccination works. 2 people 1 needs stop spread. Next say Oxygen saves lives! EU absolutely smarting speed British vaccination drive.

Which led voicing fantasies they're going overtake UK left ""crawling fours"".

I see catch unless countries like Germany France start million doses day each.

The UK approaching 32 million first doses ahead Eu second doses too. Sanofi nothing wrong. failed lack effort. think implication EU put much hope particular vaccine compared UK bet large number different vaccines.

This paying even AZ vaccine stopped we'll soon Novavax replace plus Moderna/J&amp;J He’s trolling entire sub trying push narrative. check comment history everyone vaccinated. You’re hazard you’re not. 

You opt want it’s choice. think op mean getting second dose 6 days took time. 
Fortunately EU countries enough Pfizer Moderna vaccinate populations, send AZ countries refrigeration may issue whose can't afford expensive vaccines. office brought us back full time, despite spending money get everyone set remotely last year. even said things working well, top management can’t get past idea need physically present office. Huge bummer. Many nfl teams mobile tickets quite time now. 70k drunk bills fans figure pull app phone anyone sure ""/s"" appropriate context. Politicians notorious following rules. 550k deaths... meanwhile Australia New Zealand back normal months.

The arrogance sub perplexing me. Maybe listened Osterholm earlier. absolutely ones business own

This sentence really never applies questions *public health*.

That's say overstepping individual freedoms, say individual choices real impacts collective outcomes. “Anyone doesn’t want fully open right away hysterical” “we open see happens” 

😒 Neanderthal thinking 🤣🤣🤣 lost pretty much trustworthyness everyone talk to, including two working nurses currently used people aged 60 up.

At point think public confidence entirely eroded, even among still recommended for. discussing various family members, nobody wants AZ Pfizer also made available, they'd rather wait longer get appointment risk taking AZ even risk side effects low. actually correct points. However, even deaths rise, worry UK government going over-react cases rise reverse roadmap entirely. Although I'm pessimistic here, almost see televised message now, Prime Minister telling us stay home again.  Yep. Totally pointless. Always been. believe even EMA says benefits AZ outweighs risks, countries continue age restricted strategies. Germany example 20 million 60+ people AZ going supply merely cover 6-7 million people June. swapping AZ 3 available vaccines 60 people affect vaccine campaign. I'd say so. Even best pre-covid conditions, kids filthy little diseasemongers. 

Not week went previous winters kids drag home illness school infect me. Thank feeling Canada isn’t going get rid age restriction. Obviously not. existence people can't vaccinated exactly everyone be, be. Let's get herd immunity protect people. EU compensated Australia it'd probably buy Pfizer like New Zealand move on. USA would probably back Australia - problem.

This solved money - expect political capital. mom, fully vaccinated (Pfizer), tested positive Monday. saw 5-10 minutes Saturday stopped pick charger house (we live city). wearing mask fully vaccinated first shot Pfizer stupid. come contact getting tested tomorrow.

My question is, know infectious people fully vaccinated are? supposed get second shot next week, delay that, even test positive?

Thanks help. Difference hanging hanging “on them.” didn’t hang anyone; sorry unclear. simply told I’m going call Attorney call back. course says number disconnected. yeah great contact tracing operation they’ve got going lol. article specifically evangelicals.

And follow /r/atheism. also mild case Covid last July. second Moderna last Friday. Moderna vaccines left significantly equally fatigued. might. think US AZ backup plan something goes wrong J&amp;J. thing something go wrong. 15 million doses screw type wrong.

But honestly think US use AZ vaccine. mean to. don’t understand SK government eager pair enemy across border. NK abducted grandpa put concentration camp. long Kim clan power, don’t see point cooperation. larger unvaccinated population means potential opportunities virus mutate become vaccine-resistant. harmless personal choice vaccinated. violation social contract. Mandatory vaccines already exist, people violating rules many kids died measles years back good call! would definitely work americans. go back playing football right find group play with. It’s going safe though; football pretty dangerous. Finally come say this. always highly suspicious single case anywhere world traced back surface exposure, save really shaky one New Zealand said garbage lid due lack evidence.

Hopefully finally get people stop afraid mail packages, also stop spraying Lysol absolutely everything. Maybe. weird. live US everyone eligible whole bunch states definitely getting anywhere close near-virus immunity end June. 100% happen here. everyone eligible long that. shock end month we're going anywhere close 100% immunity.  beef concept vaccine passports (really, coronavirus response past ~1 year) creeping normality. 

**In vacuum**, big deal. Yes, carrying around piece paper electronic document saying got two shots big deal easy. Yes, wearing mask relatively easy people (not since breath blowing eyes agitates nightmare-ish seasonal allergies, that's another discussion). tiny limits freedoms. cares, right? 

...But still limits. slowly stack limits top multiple generations, eventually frog gets boiled alive, trust government eventually turn stove. N95 masks sure. Cloth masks people take eating drinking don’t cover noses, doubt much. 

Here US, latter. told employees return, it'll Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday everyone office. Mondays Fridays work remotely.  
 
We've year feel strongly worked know well, seeing office. Congrats antibodies! Congrats soon peak immunity! need study tell us air filters filters circulating clean air room effective air born virus? Maybe, study double checks expected outcome call break completely forgetting obesity statistics.. way mention USA block supplies explain problems deliver EU (but problems started ban...) Yes have. exchanges still too. guy earning 8x old salary- unbelievable game changer makes healthcare non-issue. example gave - much could save year 560k salary? Yeah schools even shell pencils paper. way fuck afford better hvac system Interesting findings Bengaluru. I'd curious know Bangalore experienced similar results. 

&amp;#x200B;

🤣  careful vaccines, though.

A single misstep got anti-vax moms marching Washington again. haha well that’s nurses Here, put nose right butt!!!!! deadly serious. provided basis argument. I’ve done math. Kindly go away now. every place same, every person same, still lot benefits living high cost living area. told could save hundreds month living cornfield Nebraska still worth spending live bigger city. difference kids adults reentering public normalcy? Serious question. seems like whole pandemic everyone ""getting kids back school."" made sense me, given essentially silent super spreader population. 

Now adults need vaccine passport anything? 

I vaccine, really get this... think mandates, whether free market government trigger new degree obstinance defiance disorder lot Americans... Yeah, ""didn't grow things"" /s

and everyone's busy trying shoe horn old method virtual.

Tech illiteracy kills me, especially person that's done accounting 20 years idea excel auto-sum feature. - like nope better get calculator find number. passport. Good luck that. Data shows otherwise far know? Danish paper saying majority blood clot cases second vaccine? I'll see find source later governments listing scheduled deliveries website. Germans Danes perhaps best. can't cite ""show papers"" without regard context call argument.
You ""show papers"" drive car, get married, buy bottle wine. even get it? body strong enough immune response first time think would fail second time? Pfizer jab two Months second jab? wounder wait 3 Months? 

Guessing might fairly new policy, get first jab 3 weeks ago. Kinda makes sense expecting shortages. Get many people first jab sort protection spread long takes people get second dose others get first.  Risk infection transmission confirmed greatly reduced well mRNA vaccines. hesitated say sure last contest something? please stop UK vs EU crap. Uhhh medical information entry foreign country (admissibility) thing giving medical information private business ok👌🏻 Get vaccinated wouldn’t issue! age group people AZ vaccine? :) people said no-one Pfizer CVST gone quiet well! Wow, implying put tabloid newspaper article link comment definitely opinion based article. I'm sorry, opinions seem coming here. Unless care giving someone comorbidities age 70 kills them. cares others anyway, amirite?
Or, get this, care millions people getting increase likelihood mutations coming around fuck society even more. fucking cares though, amirite? took years state upgrade computer systems databases able even offer Real ID.. even want think attempting this.. DMV enough issues saying vaccination worth chance dying car crash way vaccination site much higher dying Covid infection? make sense? me, ""5:00, time go garage work out."" great part day. Sick sitting day anxious something physical. onto shower good meal. Breaks day perfectly. main point, mRNA vaccines contain live virus (unlike MMR varicella) thus safe immunocompromised people, correct. Man...

I cared enough actual disease stay inside. understood others needed vaccine waited patiently.

But news AZ allowed get vaccine people began refusing it. really care. something kills pandemic, it. I'm gonna take chance vaccine instead virus.

But would suck massively vaccine become unavailable already present. got extra stocks, use get faster, want it? I'm really glad government full incompetent politicians, honestly, would hated lived EU country stopped vaccinations AZ.  do, mean right trespass private venue want them.
Personally I'd rather see immunocompromised friends safely enjoying ren faire (or whatever) summer bunch wingnuts exercising ""right"" spread disease. people right autonomy body? 

Sure do! autonomy, however, ends choices affect others. want get vaccinated, that's choice. like ""bodily autonomy"" mean right cough people's faces, ""right"" attend social events knowingly infection hazard.  four vaccine producers released commitments Q2 reason optimistic. 

Where read this? virus remains prevalent, risk calculus likelihood expose * likelihood infect. 1/1,000 infection odds, 1,000 exposures virus poses material risk infection. don’t know whether post-vaccination infection cause long-term effects. me, it’s clear means live life smartly. I’ll go stores mask. I’ll socialize outdoors indoors unmasked people know still taking virus seriously. I’m going indoor restaurant, theater situation indoors people don’t know unmasked. Exactly. Possibly young people great chances surviving Covid even caught it. Vaccines perfect, even someone gets asymptomatic case, that's yet another vector mutant strain future.

When 25 caught whooping cough. Whooping cough! Turns TDaP vaccine wears sometime age 20, nobody told me. sick fucking month. idea caught from, terrifies unknowingly passed along someone baby vaccinated yet.

The fact caught means still wild, floating around somehow. think main thing majority vulnerable vaccinated. I'm concerned waiting bit longer mine. Yeah, wrote thinking specifically UK, though makes sense interpreted way. Sorry that. 

I thinking terms France, Italy Spain seeing 30-40 deaths per millions last seven days. 

Thankfully UK good spot right now. UK resident, would hesitant get AZ vaccine, here. responded something serious, good faith, would received similarly serious good faith response. US anyway, building funds nutrition funds come pot kids getting one meal day would almost certainly qualify federally-subsidized breakfast.

Air quality standards exist. decades research recommendations this. understand unknowns Covid, indoor air quality ventilation topics researched decades shown helpful. would say look HVAC standards. countries would something like this. know people vaccinated infected, seems like likelihood getting vaccinated higher getting infected. Ah great. fuel antivaxx nutjobs Sorry, minimums gone missouri recently, think $10.30 something right now.

Couple years ago right school, minimum federal $7.65 got offers $8-12 local sign shops, one place mass produces custom hats buy amazon. wonder calculate current restrictions covid vaccines. Theoretically havent tested real world scenario yet. guess continue situation next fall. Sadly Per COVID killed three under-40 age groups. (Chart: ""COVID-19-associated deaths, age sex"")

You're demonstrating COVID *more* dangerous vaccine. Covid different virus H1N1, pretending they're false equivalence. People shown right thing free will, that's 400k people died disease could prevented staying home wearing masks. It’s terrible think sharing opinion could lead negativity. understand people willing take , others interested. people forget freedom choice? people forget EVERY SINGLE DAY LIVING risk itself? People make risky choices every day according intellect free will. problem pandemic MSM took away free choice pinning everyone other, forgetting human right choice. someone says want inject questionable substance body created 10th time vaccines, let choice without condemnation. Yet people don’t know successful vaccines take 10+ years come about. People say “science getting better” that’s one fast, yet don’t know 2002 MRNA vaccines tried FDA approved years could prove safety that’s kept getting denied. MSM keeps bad adverse effects hushed, search find them. people search find. Let people make informed decisions, whatever is. 

I anti vaxx, vaxxs flu’s, yet don’t support vaccine. make antivaxx? It’s another divide conquer ploy target people hate them. Don’t fall it. Please search own, thoroughly. Yeah, one ever going conspiracy theorists concerned it, banning terrible. wasnt given choice, AZ giving vaccine centre day appointment. Back January, everything seemed bleak happy taken whatever vaccine available me!  think started getting locally produced doses recently. expected receive initial doses produced Europe seems like affected AstraZeneca's shortfall like many countries. experts Reddit lol don’t forget superspreader cruise ship-choir practices. Yeah idea every worker needs collaborate day ridiculous. hire someone paint picture stick middle open office. That's essentially many companies though - put people whose job 95% solo work needs concentration right middle noisy office. rights end harm someone else’s life. fucking different? article linked like 6 days CDC recommended updated guidelines. title may poorly worded, may response speculation vaccination makes asymptomatic carrier instead truly making immune unable carry it. 99% people know get vaccine sort happy divulge bitching much arm hurt. Venue tickets generally check ticket legit already counted, many tickets sold one recorded. Can't passport.  what? [citation required] know work people going USA vacations Good. MIS-C post covid part numbers. Anti masker/anti vax/republicans

...and plenty non-deplorables well, dislike government / corporate overreach want protect erosion individual liberties. Idk, people know locally Cleveland still going partying bars every night never stopped. Even getting hospitalized themselves. college professor mom UofM says ""people meant socially distance, unnatural."" 

America dumb. thoughts daily new infection rate mid May? Seems like high numbers now, I’m wondering start plummeting within next month? Oh sure! wasn’t fun.

My friend got second 0 reaction Norway's 100k total cases *all* age groups.

You're comparing apples oranges. TBH, probably would vaccinated kids, teens, young adults first. really understand mortality, they'll go around spreading like nothing. elderly pre-condition people understand severity, part staying inside. would anybody think vaccinating people already quarantining would help herd immunity? interesting read. hope they're vaccinated soon. Propositional black evangelical, false. Hey quick question, work healthcare get phizer? Link? bearing whether is, fact, medical information. Proof vaccination still medical information. People comfortable giving data industry ask it. Dwight? Maybe US ship then. may not, reducing number unvaccinated people large social gathering would certainly reduce number infections people could perpetuate. making fun if? think it’s good thing?

I’m gonna go limb say UV proven kill virus.

And viruses actually spread air handling units... Don’t know. completely ok compare rare dangerous blood clot blood clots whole /s. I'm Netherlands 35. gov says get shot end-june.  Yes problem also less 65+ ... problem really mostly parent generation. B.117 lands icus, survive many cases stuff icus longer. filling icus last wave 30% infection cases way higher test rate (and way less undetected cases). 

Not even talking long covid people come ICUs again!

The heat chart clearly shows numbers went schools reopened starting lower ages upwards steep decline past parent kids generations. don’t agree decision full capacity Rangers games, also don’t want people get sick. 

There’s currently thread /r/news basically filled people cheering Texans get sick spread covid. It’s pretty disgusting. 40,000 parents. sad arent around 100 million parents US?

Smells like fear porn. *Bill Gates entered chat* confused frustrated entire pandemic focus deaths hospitalizations. Studies consistently find 30% people developing long term effects without regard severity initial disease, real number think informing behavior relaxation mitigation measures test positivity. People states seem throwing caution wind based hospitalization death numbers even data test positivity gets worse accuracy drops fewer tests performed. kind feels like audience horror movie yelling people screen open door. Yeah know took long. took first appointment could first dose middle January. first appointment could get second dose end March. That's about. signally smart are. clearly idea people earn money money. don’t know person personally, I’d bet 25:1 he’s living threshold means (or even spending earns) saving nothing- simply that’s vast majority Americans do, regardless income (except super super high earners) someone States first time I've ever heard ""USians"" haha, pronounce it? Fauci said fully vaccinated people get tested they're showing symptoms. likely get staph. Making venues safe whole point far I'm concerned. Vaccine requirements usually medical exemptions. Yeah, month think is? far know experts US even expecting us full near full immunity June. probably rate we're going, even experts optimistic, hard time seeing true Europe.

Whether legal half debate. bigger issue 2 months we'll enough people vaccinated point necessary. implement sorts policies, they're nearly impossible roll back. drive hours away get first shot. automatically schedule second appointment, location cannot figure way change it.  want cancel appointment.  

This walgreens does. Makes shit difficult possible. study like came months ago.. Fine, I'm people told potential side-effects given vaccine. can't moment there's proven causation it. first AZ shot three hours ago. couple nights extensive ""research"", decided I'm terrified virus lot more.

I belong ""young"" age group and, nothing severe, couple health conditions enough considered priority list.

Of course, terrifies now. also rather strong health anxiety issues, something started taking antidepressants recently, think they're going help couple upcoming weeks.

CANBERRA (Reuters) - European Union Tuesday denied blocking shipments 3.1 million doses AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine Australia steps scrutiny vaccine shipments address EU shortages.

An Australian government source told Reuters EU blocked 3.1 million shots country little hope getting remaining 400,000 doses promised time.
The dispute underscores massive shortfalls AstraZeneca shot across EU bloc complicates Australia’s inoculation campaign, already 83% behind original schedule.
“We cannot confirm new decision block vaccine exports Australia country,” European Commission spokesman told news conference.
A second spokeswoman said bloc rejected one total 491 COVID-19 vaccine export requests since enhanced export transparency late January, added seven requests currently reviewed - therefore shipments hold decision made.

She declined say whether new shipment Australia among reviewed.
The rejected request far shipment 250,000 doses Australia earlier year. March 24, EU exported 1 million doses Australia.

With inoculation rollouts running far behind Britain United States, EU tightened oversight vaccine exports last month, giving greater scope block shipments countries higher inoculation rates. “They’ve blocked 3.1 million shots far,” said Australian government source, adding received 300,000 doses 400,000 doses scheduled arrive end April.
“We haven’t given hope we’ve stopped counting expected supplies,” source said. person declined named authorised talk matter.

Australia Tuesday confirmed block 250,000 doses AstraZeneca doses EU, Canberra said would delay inoculation timetable.
An EU official said responsible AstraZeneca’s failure upholding commitments countries, drug maker aims deliver 100 million doses bloc end June 300 million pledged.
AstraZeneca immediately reply request comment Tuesday.
It unclear whether Australia plans ask Britain United States ship AstraZeneca doses.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday missing shipments responsible meeting inoculation schedule. “In early January, anticipated would 3.1 million vaccines. vaccines supplied Australia,” Morrison told reporters Canberra. “That reason.”
The AstraZeneca vaccine arriving Europe underpin early stages Australia’s vaccine drive, supplementing 50 million shots vaccine produced locally CSL Ltd.
But latest supply blockages leave Australia struggling step pace vaccination drive, started much later countries due low case numbers.
Australia recorded 909 coronavirus deaths since pandemic began said Tuesday would launch quarantine COVID-testing free travel bubble New Zealand month effectively eradicating virus closing borders last year.

Its vaccine programme running well behind schedule, 670,000 people inoculated initial target 4 million end-March.
While government blamed slow rollout supply issues Europe, Australian state governments also complained slower-than-expected distribution lack certainty supplies. absolutely crazy given much companies save overhead employees working home. Employees getting raise, way round Yes, believed small risk risk tiny everything life carries risk.

Where hell last year? US, money air filters HVAC upgrades coming funds earmarked Covid Relief. Schools need protect students, can't vaccinated yet, improving air quality important hand sanitizer that's creating superbugs fomite transmission huge.

Air quality upgrades, many schools, long overdue. 100% this. 

I believe that’s whole concept “herd immunity” - “herd” getting vaccinated protect cannot (like health reasons young) many people vaccinated virus cannot reach unvaccinated. situation definitely used antivaxxers 

This feels like canard, tbh. crap-ton valid data misused misrepresented antivaxxers, regardless. don’t dictate appropriate health responses — educated grown-ups do. 

Besides, we’re looking reduce *vaccine hesitancy*. regard, transparency always best policy. Probably mechanism COVID would guess. definitely depends who/where are. I'm college right 8 people live 7 gotten it. Past diseases: aerosols, need masks, touching face.

Current disease, too: People grab faces putting mask. reduce average distances masks go shopping eating masks make safe. think it’ll come accumulation risk factors. Youth + gender + genetics? + tobacco use? + misfortune.

Those long ramblings side effects US pharma commercials largely due this. experiencing side effects may vulnerable part body begin with. keep seeing immunosuppressant-like drugs TV, course, one side effects ""death."" comb data, see participants died likely already quite immunosuppressed, suffered condition immunosuppression would bad thing. 

Now - that's going excuse particular drug properly scrutinized - AZ vaccine absolutely studied understand underlying condition puts higher risk blood clots, generally speaking, issues see considered rare likely due specific conditions might make go ""oh well makes sense happened."" comparable issues. Everyone exercise, communicable disease. completely understand. things logical hard explain people without getting upset. think part also wanting reward selfish breaking rules, punishing following rules. Ultimately, I'd probably favor completely random lottery ball system pegged SSN range. think would better job lowering spread, easier pill swallow people. 

&amp;#x200B;

It also kind exposes hypocrisy public message too. whole time saying, ""Hey, virus different, killing young people like killing old people, nobody's safe. Even people nothing wrong beforehand risk."" vaccine they're like, ""Oh, worry that, old pre-existing condition, fine, keep spreading. probably bad anyway"" Australia certainly would be... erm... guess Australia already :) you’re saying lot ill-informed ill-intentioned people used twisted become anti-vaccine propaganda, completely agree you. don’t think medical reports educated speculations doctors put category, though. high positivity rates low testing numbers are. Florida testing NJ rate, example, it’s entirely possible would materially higher. probably missing lot asymptomatic cases states low testing rate, asymptomatic cases still put people high risk long term consequences.  papers"" drive car

That's driving machine used carefully run people married

Because need prove identity sign bottle wine.

To prove certain age.

Here we're talking prohibiting people something always done subject injected blood stream enforcement actions policy. think crossed finish line. risk always heavily concentrated small % people, elderly health conditions. 75%+ vaccinated. never goal eradicate virus completely eliminate 100% risk contagion. reduce risk something everyone tolerate done flu, measles, etc.

So many kids families suffering kids missing school. College plans derailed kids missed 25% high school college educations socialization, sports, activities, dating, etc goes along that. Restaurants small businesses permanently closed. People unemployed homeless. Mental health issues rampant. long past time open things people safe responsible. would honestly voluntary ones make international travel easier people need to. Ehhh dismissive. Nothing work mind. I’m sure you’re getting downvoted mental gymnastics cancel culture? Take comfort knowing threads much Texas dropped mandate, sadly posters disappointed. new story result. agree. Hehe, bloody. It’s one thing know it’s bad. Anyone two brain cells identify that.

How fix it’s bad another thing entirely. None nessecitates rather authoritarian public health measures would little impact actual spread overall. 

All happen time regular flu strains (or common viral illness) need flu vaccine passport? examples:

[Excelsior Pass | COVID-19 Vaccine 

[CommonPass | Digital Health

Not impossible forge (fake IDs already exist) people won't. banned people AIDS going bars might meet people give AIDs, actually would 330 million Americans, less AIDs spread aids death banned positive people social actions QR code simply contains name, could faked.

It needs contain name digital signature made one vaccination authorities/hospitals. verified app access entities certificates. ""Oh no, people internet jump straight conclusions like did!! stupid wait evidence! conclusion accidentaly correct, therefore always bad wait!"" that's want live rest life, it. risk analysis fully vaccinated vast majority americans vaccinated really make sense. doubt things pre pandemic fine.  killed 7 people UK 25m who've vaccine. proven linked vaccine, statistically infinitessimally small number meaningless. 

A whole lot people die result refusing vaccine, certain. It’s opposite effect me. can’t wait get vaccine zero interest prove anyone. It’s nobody’s business own. I’m going worried people unvaccinated I’m vaccinated know vaccines effective proven be. I’d never even ask someone they’re vaccinated it’s business. Governor Abbott ban boogeyman *just might* real 😱 see 50k cases day 1000 dead today like... meh... Look stats summer December bro! go back time year tell - 50 k day 1000 dead. Scarry stuff. go back time 2019 tell again. virus infecting 50k day killing 500 1000 daily. would like EFFING WAY! CAN'T HAPPEN. Osterholm maybe still values life way 2019 got complacent stats. 50k 1000 dead... Meh. stable... Yes, two latte please, two old fashioned donuts, yes. Thank you. Scroll next.... Thanks. wrote voicing concerns vaccine anti-vaxx propaganda. Sure, anti-vaxx people used it, you’re allowed skeptical getting label attached. You’re anti-vaxx you’re concerned one vaccine four offered. reason aren’t going see 100 million people instantly rush get vaccine people desperately want vaccine already gotten scheduled get it. nation we’re moving “I desperately want vaccine crowd” “yeah, I’d take vaccine you’ve gotta make easy me” crowd “eh, might take vaccine I’m gonna wait see” crowd.  Agreed full.

We quickly work many children lost parent covid trawling health data cross referencing census data.

We know one died. know person children not. huge stretch work great deal statistical confidence. Sadly ever eradicated, impossible now. hope virus suppressed enough vaccines stop mutations. Government IDs racist though question is, actually know AZ safer people 60? 

For decent period time, nobody older 65 vaccinated AZ EU, side effects recorded older population. Further, someone suddenly dying 70 80 probably trigger less investigation someone dying 40 – many cases may overlooked?

I'm making definitive statements here, I'm genuinely curious.

The next issue AZ generally less effective still leaves vaccinate people vulnerable mild moderate cases COVID. leads people still able function vectors risk long-term effects COVID (long COVID).

If 70+ German social distancing routine kept healthy past 12 months, would book appointment AZ. Biontech/Pfizer really available population within weeks I'd much rather take vaccine, higher efficacy known variants, fewer less severe side effects significantly lowers risk vector risk long COVID.

For society whole, would obviously best anybody get vaccinated ASAP, even less effective vaccines, individual may case. Well materials probably replaced local production, face it, EU also would go full export stop approach like Britain USA do, many countries seriously would f\*\*\* up! working home digital designer work? know monitor color accuracy calibration big deal, editing takes lot computing resources. provide guys equipment home? It’s really bad get vaccine. It’s worth living like hermit next year, believe me! pharmacies STL area. I'm saying. 70 mile commute want to. work guy commutes 3 hrs. get it. studio apartment town drives Sunday night drives back home Friday work. also says pay much better I'm sure 5 years truly understand relocate family. Demographically seems rare response younger people, stronger immune systems elderly. 

Which problematic rate death COVID care healthy people 40 near-zero. *can* life-threatening cases bodies handle punishment supported. Meanwhile, side effect complication highly deadly even best care. 

This ethical mess. One places might helpful people prove vaccinated COVID-19 would university dormitories. Almost require vaccine documentation already (MMR etc.). Public universities definitely fall this, question providing vaccine record passport.

Republicans selling latest anti-government freedom boner ""papers please"" Nazi resistance, proving immunizations certain instances there's clear public health concern something already regular basis. policy care about, news fodder rally base.

I think HEB ever going require show vaccination info walk buy groceries. think reasonable airline deny boarding showing symptoms COVID. could cold something else. proof COVID vaccination solves issue. Otherwise able fly cough, airlines caught lawsuit negligently exposed flyers risk.

Once universities decide COVID vaccines required living campus (some already started process anticipated fall semester) vaccine passport legislations going stand. They'll either rescind build massive system caveats makes effectively useless. Yeah either way don’t want catch this. That's I'm at. 

Right elderly people vaccinated. Clubs, movies, concert venues going making money excluding unvaccinated population anyway.

In month two gets rolled out, it'll safe way profitable let everyone in. anything, roll it'll another small business stifling measure (i.e. cases low, young people fully vaccinated cannot paying customers).

For getting high compliance, make vaccines mandatory international travel, work, school. higher chance dying traffic accident specifically next week dying vaccine. Maximum suppression means even widespread vaccination, social distancing masks continue... avoid restrictions indefinitely? Restrictions forever avoid restrictions forever? 


It also seems like first-world problem, proposed people never visited poor town developing country. Whole families live together square meters. Many places sewer, clean water, hospitals, etc, people literally go morning earn money buy food dinner. Millions people already live streets, number likely increased 2020. ""maximum"" suppress virus areas? I'll living God!! Lockdowns don’t work anything except destroying economies. Look US example economic recovery post covid. economy roaring back unemployment levels (even enhanced unemployment) back within 2% pre crisis people act like ""long covid"" forever, UK study matter found significant decline people reporting symptoms time. zero faith NYC ever let up. 

Vaccinated people still wearing masks Central Park walking dog. Unvaccinated people like everyone 16? Sure We’re banning ideas idea government mandated vaccine passports aren’t weren’t fucking thing

So it? government it, not? actually know AZ safer people 60? decent period time, nobody older 65 vaccinated AZ

So, also means state federal covid assistance, PPE loans, various grants, etc, etc, etc, right? could mistaken; wording awfully dang broad. order, dated April 5, also “prohibits organizations receiving public funds requiring consumers provide documentation vaccine status order receive service enter place.”

Feels like grandstanding me, imho. Yes, I'm favor states ability make different policies. Texas so, renders critique pretty silly. also noticed authors Douglas County. really sure research institutions anything else really there, think it’s fair assume it’s way nothing topic hand.

Projection, though, right? (Alabama) ends today well.  well social end masks coming either way. go restaurants even staff wears mask anymore place packed. looked around movie theater Kong/Godzilla nobody wearing mask. pretty much except Costco grocery store going pretty strict enforcement. person getting cancelled case? parents lazy ones. would rather pawn responsibilities onto teachers. Hospitals won’t require vaccine it’s approved FDA Yeah, don’t even bother posting much prefer working office since I’d get downvoted oblivion. advice given thread downright dangerous.

Choosing get highly effective vaccine pandemic 1 million chance death dangerously stupid.

In UK alone, COVID-19 killed **hundreds** people 30. Thousands serious complications hospital, including many many cases blood clots.

Refusing vaccine offer means might get another offer *months*. society opens more, virus find unvaccinated, balance risks become obvious (by time late). Suicides down. put headline? That's great news.  vaccine formally approved FDA required go school?

When vaccine requirement implemented enter businesses like venues, restaurants, stores? People drive anyways, save much comparison small risk catching getting severely injured Sars-COV2. apples apples work company pay more/less based remotely work. base salary, add 'geolocation' percentage calculated cost-of-living. long street goes ways, think fair. true, one would ever recover illness. man vote Paywall point here. constant comparison flu highly detrimental management pandemic. frustration people blindly trusted AstraZeneca (despite completely preventable vaccine trial blunders) UK regulators highly trained scientists number different countries ringing alarm something amiss. 

I epidemiologist training, say I'm fan anti-vaxxers might understatement century, situations authorities give assurances without thoroughly vetting nothing add fuel anti-vaxxer fire. Transparent communication important. See top comment. state mandated, it'll another month least figure secure system work legality behind disclosing medical information business owners. government probably 2 months. lawsuits. impractical timeline, governors touch issue anyway.

Even open, vaccinated, right means elderly. Clubs concerts going poppin' vaccinated young people. Everywhere else basically open, would actually mean closing doors people businesses. time worked out, cases low governors ended restrictions. leave restrictions up, pushes timeline businesses recover even wait young people secure appointments.

There's practical reason try this. best case scenario maybe one month trickling business vaccinated people prior dropping restrictions. Meanwhile, downsides every time walk store venue documented government database seems pretty clear me. Also, something could done relatively easily. hard employee wipe everything bleach ethanol. far harder renovate building's HVAC system. Therefore, reassure customers employees talking much effort putting cleanliness. Well, also ability write executive orders. Context matters. impossible enforce/police. impossible enforce/police whole point null void. literally not. Excelsior pass run NY ""government mandated"" exactly OP said.

It's use optional private businesses want use it. Private businesses absolutely deny service public health reasons choose. Yeah, husband’s group includes 20 associates exactly zero met hours billing requirements 2020. correct term 'American'. Since correct term, use context. already knew that. sure trying invent terminology one uses understands, even pronounce Vaccine mandates would discriminate minority communities great news! Anti-vaxxers go away society. something cancelled government-sanctioned ban automatically put culture. got see many experts Reddit 

Ironic certain conclusion report published tomorrow.

For clarity I'm making comment safety otherwise AZ anti brigade bad pro brigade latching onto whatever suits agenda. recommendation would use different vaccine. 

In case children's vaccines this, safety demands *are* going stringent. things dangerous extremely weak argument continuing vaccinate demographic something potentially lethal (if rare) side-effect associated. Especially considering side-effect picked clinical trials poorly understood moment. coercion.

The government currently forcing businesses choose staying closed. option reopen without vaccine requirement even table many states. 

And private businesses requiring vaccines form coercion people. options part untouchables unvaccinated caste, get vaccine participate society. ""choice"" really.

And fact matter free market private businesses think profitable. private businesses think profitable government holds gun heads. Cause still really early relaxing everything time. reference Australian state New South Wales still limits nightclubs despite one case yesterday. EU make vaccines pharmaceutical companies guarantee started wearing mask you. We've done part side, suburb lowest rates infection Illinois.

That mean can't opinion statistically little risk 18. like businesses right refuse service. 

They right refuse gay people. right refuse disabled people. protected human rights. Denying service one exercising autonomy contents body rights violation you? problem itnis circular argument:

""We know reason well population immunity rather factors.""

""The reason know population immunity rather factors part population immune.""

Basically, argument trying tonuse hypothesis prove conclusion. Yesterday thirsty ( could anxiety ) got headache hours later stomach little weird. Took 500mg Tylenol feeling good. Last night arm got really started hurt. woke today sore arm muscle aches. Feel like I’m coming cold. bad fever anything didn’t get riled enough write executive order. Scale matters. option WFH currently do. little house really set well work efficiently.

In fact, majority pandemic worked office myself. state changed couple words WFH requirements forced start working home back November, even though one else office.

I know least 2 coworkers would prefer stay working home.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s super conjecture nonsense posted. J J certain “crossing fingers”. almost years worth data mixed millions people far basically nothing. Obviously always lookout side affects. really hard find worse covid response days Ontario  Yes. reddit. society, including so-called responsible journalistic outfits like NYT. People become psychologically invested ""believing science"" counter conspiracy theorists begun erode basis scientific theory. evidence supports conspiracy theory, ceases theory -- becomes conspiracy. Sure, UK probably largest data set obviously also country dismissive link AZ increase CVST cases. There's certain level mistrust I'll convinced AZs safety record 60+ cohort, additional data sets EU countries. know. :(

Just wish could make rules together. They’d better rules, IMHO. Actually lockdown. Vaccination hardly got underway time peak 'crushed'. France hand locked properly (i.e. closed schools).

However vaccination allow us open without cases exploding. Yup- good them. survey results look show outliers. vast majority Americans live paycheck paycheck well “upper middle class” earnings. Gotta keep joneses buy flashy toys, know.
That’s way fun saving. Many problems stem single sourcing vaccine could alternates willing pay more. easy fake. You’re back square one necessarily. There's increase vaccine skepticism towards vaccines Norway. anything people reassured seeing health agencies took AZ seriously start. spray disinfectant playground equipment. Omg lol I'm lost works reality. 

Let's say tomorrow government says, ""okay, clubs open, vaccinated."" 

It's like grandma going go running club, people concerns forging vaccine cards. happens instead spend month developing bad app uses software meant protect privacy, since vaccination status protected HIPAA. takes weeks roll work bugs. We're late May June functional.

By COVID cases low. Governments rolling back restrictions pretty readily unpopular, we've got vaccine passport. businesses waiting people get vaccine fully vaccinated passport functional. probably late summer business looks even semi-normal perspective.

It seems much better business societal standpoint make mandatory school/work/travel base restrictions cases/hospitalization. Good - encourage others get vaccine need vaccine passports anything beyond international travel. 90% people get vaccine, need passports. 65% people get it, be. becomes grey area dependent much virus gets stamped out.  You’re purposely obtuse. Telling someone I’m vaccinated doesn’t stigma telling people aids. happens basically purely remote companies. you’re living city, you’re going paid live city. RemindMe! 3 months Same, I'm project manager unless I'm ground running event real-time, reason office. told boss I'm staying home unless reason there. 


Luckily institution embraced new normal downsized physical footprint considerably. Whole departments going fully remote. Doesn’t really make sense considering vaccine mostly prevent severe disease person takes Yes! awful. kids school allowed play ball recess they're allowed touch object another person touched. Ffs numbers went dummies 18-30s range going back bars eating.

The vaccines cover variants. 

Stop feet mongering. Ideas get getting banned years now. nothing new.

And one planning it, nothing get riled Lol nope, ever written  Probably family reasons people feel attached ""comfortable"" job afraid change. understand either, know people justify spending much time car everyday. whether right doesnt matter anymore, society accept it. many people feel owed freedom able go restaurants send kids plague mines know else unethical? companies made vaccines. ""Luke, father!"" banned people AIDS going bars might meet people give AIDS, could massively reduce AIDs spread AIDS deaths. Well typically refer people US separated states america. Depends topic talking someone studied maths...

You still put two unlikely scenarios relation. Risking 0.1% chance death prevent 0.01% chance death *not* worth it. opinion, states localities remove mandates 7 days moving average hospitalizations cases even reasonable number regardless amount vaccinated. That’s kind sub is. Anything “this ends tomorrow time take masks off” gets downvoted oblivion. That's exactly posted experience. People scared side effects hear horror stories. wife early 30's, COVID November got hospital, neither us side effects either dose. parents, early 60's side effects either dose well. 

But like said, ""everything fine"" boring post. FaBuLouS ain't she? /s

- April 13, 27, May 3, 17: Company renews work home orders

- June 1: employees asked return work on-site. Mask mandate established.

- June 2: learn throughout April May, since plant close increased production hours (pandemic busy), 22 people got COVID, 2 hospitalized. traced carpooling. I'm skeptical. 

- June 3 - November 15 - Periodically people take unexpected time off. kept dark. 

- November 16 - Director comes sick dog goes meetings. spends half day coughing thin-blue-line mask. several meetings (one me). leaves 2PM.

- Night November 17th: 10 us get email saying ""you room person. Monitor symptoms and/or get tested."" 

- November 18th: Teammate gets tested gets symptoms. Work demands anyone gets tested stay office results come back. 

- November 20th: get tested. work home. HR asks daily ""when coming back in?"" told I'm taking two weeks. boss approves.

- November 21st: boss begins feel ill. holds getting tested Monday. possible came Monday pick papers. clear. 

- November 23rd: New stay-at-home order goes out. majority team 7 infected. somehow okay.

I'm saying spirit idea bad. execution idea one needs analysis. take advantage fact general population know basic math lazy them, country like Australia New Zealand say young people right better take vaccine asap covid riskier, Covid incidence low there, make fool people... ""At least 246 people Michigan “fully vaccinated” COVID-19 later diagnosed virus, including 11 hospitalized three died, according Michigan Department Health Human Services.  

More 1.8 million Michigan residents completed COVID-19 vaccinations, according state."" 


I'll take odds day week.  deaths would least started increase based long taken historically, they’re still decreasing significantly. It’s really surprising continuing decrease considering 75% people 65 gotten least one dose vaccine. don’t think reason believe deaths lagging longer usual.  Still , die covid taken. probably better waiting offered one instead AZ

This terrible advice. Staying unvaccinated potentially months far far dangerous CVST risk alternatives

Close tabs, open full screen, **listen:** since ~76% Dutch population says want get vaccinated means enough vaccines fully vaccinate every 16+ year old wants end Q2.

Then...we’ll know turned out😕 Actually Austria, went mild lockdown milder lockdown bars still closed schools opened february timeframe. 2 tests per week every school kid, masks thinned classes primary schools kindergardens. Masks half classes 10+ onwards!

It took one week til first schools emergency close numbers went pretty much 5-7 days delay school kids parent generations. east austria opened one week early close go harder lockdown school incidents 400+ general population incidences 200-300+!

The west still keeps easter week gave us somewhat breathing room, schools reopened today probably see effect next week. B.117 simply different beast! type vector it? I'm commenting point making, man reminded FOZZY concert Sturgis.

Imagine dying COVID wanted see SmashMouth Fozzy? that’s completely irrational. cases covid forever, won’t eradicate it. logic also capacity restrictions forever. won’t ever zero covid like New Zealand australia trying time long gone. small window opportunity till April 2020. Even assuming true (which necessarily is) message vaccines end pandemic hammered hard population people accept restrictive measures unless dead start pile streets. 

If happens (which find highly unlikely) major trouble nobody going believe anything again. Nice talking you, fellow American 😀 Vaccinated infected? Oh I'm sorry guess spell everything you. Nobody relevance advocating government mandated vaccine passports.

I know, saw tweet 3 likes calling forever lockdowns passports. 😴 Cases follow path enough 16-30 people vaccinated. They're ones spreading right imo stopped washing groceries 3rd time realized long actually keep packages wet kill virus. would take hours weekly groceries. Pair risk getting cleaner foods frozen foods lost cause, stuck washing hands touched anything cold asking wife same. still got milk fridge paper towel got Covid cousin January. 

Hope second dose comes uneventfully normalcy returns! don't, cost-benefit analysis different over-60s they're much likely die covid-19 vaccination delayed don’t believe so, might advisory though. 

It’s still little chilly, don’t really care. it’s 80 degrees I’m vaccinated, way I’m wearing mask outside. real. rig hepa filter system less day. It’s astounding schools restaurants haven’t done this. One vaccine many. views vindicated wrong ways. They’ll become emboldened easily able spread lies. Soon people refusing Moderna Pfizer vaccines they’ll think they’ll magically heart attacks. OMG. accountant, sheer number older accountants can’t figure Excel staggering. It’s seriously rocket science, people. Figure hell out. ever see movie scanners? Congrats made head blow up. vaccinated don’t matter Well case it’s probably best reconvene four weeks see argument becomes accurate think arguably lockdown place North America currently, coupled awful vaccine rollout. 

The Ford's government stay middle he's pissing pro lockdown people wish safely remain open. talks another stay home order plus coming encouraging atm... Someone never fake ID college don’t use passports.  go bar across street vax deniers sovereign citizens. 

I don’t see freedom revoked here. think you’ll lot holdouts necessarily government mandates private sector. Like coffee shop silverlake isn’t dropping anytime soon bar Burbank isn’t gonna give fuck. federal buildings, airports, etc. bought Clorox wipes nothing? Exactly, like trying ban ISPs charging certain traffic never happening, ""could happen"" net neutrality. Remember thought crime charts like [this fucking thing*  USian take insult problem arises you’re asking younger, healthy people, get vaccine potentially poses greater risk death actual disease

This wrong several orders magnitude.

COVID kills around 1 3000 people aged 20-40 catch it.

The AstraZeneca vaccine kills around 1 1,000,000 getting - even pessimistic estimates suggest 20-40 age group risk less 1 100,000. I'd assume locker rooms, gyms, group transportation. sports relatively low risk. identify vaccine even though didn’t vaccine. see lmao agree. would've see plateau (as cases have) focus hospitalizations deaths accurate way track pandemic majority vulnerable populations vaccinated. MI parts world spike younger people testing positive cases (hopefully) lead high levels hospitalizations deaths doesn’t negate spread happening long term consequences remain risk. say when, inevitably, majority businesses opt use system? know won't. people choose get vaccinated baseless conspiracy theories 

Is baseless conspiracy theory Pfizer paid 4 billion dollars penalties lawsuits since 2000?
Is baseless conspiracy theory Johnson Johnson knowingly sold baby powder contained asbestos?
Is baseless conspiracy theory Merck's scientists sued falsifying vaccine studies? Sorry. didn’t read user names. original thing replied context said that. correct didn’t wrong. Colorado dropped  Texas banned government mandated vaccine passports also banned private businesses receiving public funds.

Thank god. 2/3 top 3 US states population it. things dead water. Surely makes less nutjob views vindicated? Yeah new virus could also come 50% lethality rate. Lol y’all enjoy fear Yes, much ethical deny EVERYONE rhe right visit restaurants, concerts, gyms, public venues, rather — HORROR — allow safe so. implication guess means small number CVST Pfizer / BioNTech coincidence (which expected). Scary headlines must stay calm collective. would feel concert venue required proof organ donor? would feel required proof taking HIV PrEP pill?

None air transmitted virus.  

As rest, slippery slope arguments tend unfounded fear. Occasionally one plays usually they’re bs. Covid time mutate it’s hearts desires developing world won’t vaccinated many years, ever you’re putting people risk they, private business, well within right protect patrons Good question Honestly, think it’s misleading tell customers air “worry free” “safe.” UVC light typically blasted *same area* 10 30 minutes straight kill many types germs. Air moving high speed past light bulb likely free COVID. 

Might slightly reduce chances? Perhaps. unfair tell customers remove masks without concern. It’s wording retail/dining establishments bothers me. what? doesnt make u immune quite opposite. sub jumped straight conclusion wasn’t linked anyone said might labeled anti vaxxer plague mines mining there? underlying medical conditions told get wait years. time goes people start wear masks less less. states dont remove mandates, people stop following them. 

Im high mask usage area. count 1 hand many people seen without mask grocery shopping last year. noticed people wearing wrong- im guessing vaccinated care less. Maybe they're trying think best people state

They trust adults make decisions themselves. Crazy af Austrian, Danish, Norwegian, Italian, French, Canadian scientists call halt something could mitigate impact virus currently ravaging countries without good reason

They would did.

That unavoidable conclusion looking actual data comparing risks COVID. Ok, I'm interested Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine that's asked ^^ know there's still debate here

Because day people angrily correct point virus smaller holes mask ""it travels droplets"" that's obviously wrong. droplets breathe might it, that's tiny part breathe travel far face without coughing sneezing, asymptomatic spread would almost entirely fueled airborne virus. American refers people US, refers resident continents North South America

Nope. Sorry, went Canada called locals Americans, would promptly country. Sorry, 'American' official term people US term applies people term floating around (fairly broadly) long time internet.

Note language says **""at least""** 6 months, ""up to"" 6 months. studies still ongoing, entirely possible protection last longer 6 months. awful news Chinese vaccines

For joining us directly separate report medical journal adds concern variants. Scientists measured antibodies block virus 50 people given Sinopharm Sinovac vaccines developed China. Many showed total partial loss effectiveness virus variant first detected South vaccines still seemed protect variant first found United Kingdom rapidly spreading Variants normal. mean flu virus suspect high variation reproduction. main concern variants might reduce efficacy vaccines people. Far 100% 100+ items touch likely infected though. really depends. vaccine hesitant folks get covid already? immunity last months? immune stay immune month 60% vaxxed think could cause herd immunity hit. hesitant get sick. vaccinated get sick it'll big deal vaccinated.  someone office since pandemic started half myself, cant wait til people come back office. would okay 1-2 days week home 3-4 days office. miss interactions coworkers activities did. knowing king cuomo operates point force businesses require passports.

[It's hoss. ***Please*** stop fearmongering spreading disinformation. I've coach *so many* directors VPs 50s 60s use even basic functionality Teams.  people advanced technical degrees MBAs yet can't figure send chat message. poor coordination communication, sure. there's contradiction. guy gave interview local news outlet topic came up. go details studies suggest there's definite link. like refused give evidence something. giving view interview since blew media headlines, EMA felt obliged make clear come final conclusion yet announce findings reasoning next days. Ja Rule think this? knows truth... logic African Americans should’ve stayed home followed restaurants schools hospitals etc. rules go Fox never amped nothing burger fire conservative victimhood. [New York State vaccine administration helping develop standards prove guess probably wouldn’t die

Probably? extremely unlikely? says clear link. EMA says established link.

He's talking unofficially, giving personal opinion. EMA speaking officially saying body yet reached decision (which mean following days, full review process still ongoing). really contradiction. Though indeed probably smart PR-wise. argument ""protecting unvaccinated"". neither scenario vaccinated protected. Either they're banned (no unvaccinated people), they're allowed (with unvaccinated people.) Neither helps them. way much effort, way unlikely effective, way much potential infringement civil liberties way little benefit. US looking year vaccine scarcity, sure maybe. Right we're looking large majority adults vaccinated 2-3 months, 12-17 year olds follow long after. Cases going crater summer, without passports.

That said, FDA fully authorizes COVID vaccine, I'm making mandatory situations society already mandates vaccines. hopefully bump vaccination rates 80's 90's. read paper (which encourage to) it’s lack 100% neutralization, lack neutralizing activity *at all*. Even wild type cases False, look Israel. infection rate lets know R0 number accurately, good metric knowing whether high low risk getting infected go out. Remember lot side effects it, neurological disorders, quite bad, kidney failure, several major issues. Death obviously important people getting increases numbers getting effects. devastating, some, avoiding also moral thing do. Israel bit 50% vaccinated cases deaths near zero dropping fully open. good example. living sort strange parallel universe Texas Florida places sensible moment. states succumbed rampant fear sensationalism.

No wonder everyone quickly migrating two states NY CA. Oh ok. guess government never spoken sides mouth before. vaccine. think absolutely right. better way putting is, *no worse than* 500k chance dying vaccinated. Again, solid solid odds. june 2023? people (but far less ton) test positive post-vaccination. never feel anything beyond minor symptoms (if that), and virtually none even need seek medical attention, much less hospitalized, put ventilator, die.

Look new numbers Michigan. 1.8 million vaccinated, 246 possible breakthroughs, 11 hospitalizations, 3 deaths. even probably overestimate true long-term risk occasional person takes longer develop appropriate immune response eventually get there.

Getting infected virus immune system knows handle called ""getting cold"". threat getting cold enough keep us inside before-times. Enjoy pariah people would banned store. danger? interesting. wish able get test March 2020, symptoms neurological didn’t qualify test time. ""Research institutions"" LOL. 5000 people living county seat (Tuscola)?

We've told vague things recent weeks suggests hybrid model employees we'll office part time working remotely rest time.  see obvious challenges there, I'm OK situation today 6-8 months ago. available? Neutralizing 100% still requirement successful vaccine. better? Yes, long available all,there's nothing it. reminds another thing I'd like learn/discuss about... variants normal part viral evolution rather crazy-freak-death-novel attribute Covid. ""Variants"" completely normal predictible. virus ""lived"" reproduced probably billion people now, differing environments different selective pressures. ""variants""? Well shit! shocking weren't. (Not arguing course... I'm fighting straw man mention ""variants"" reminded of) think asymptomatic flu carriers? mean human form opinions based personal experiences. Fuck me, right? like sort stuff going required buy groceries stuff

Not immediately .. ofcourse would go another business knowing king cuomo operates point force businesses require passports. 

also i'm reading might reach herd immunity passports....

""Growing conservative backlash idea ""vaccine passports"" — proposed private-sector industries promote safer environment states begin ease coronavirus restrictions — could make Republicans even less likely get shots, experts patriot act went away defeated terrorism.

We — that's poor example. Honestly, would probably it. Another $1200 get vaxxed, people would signed immediately.  anecdotal, hardly felt anything fist shot (maybe little tired next day), got hit fairly hard (chills, fever, fatigue) 30 hours second shot. fell asleep 6 hours woke fine next morning. “White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday federal mandate requiring every American obtain vaccination credential centralized universal federal vaccinations database.” Today’s two weeks first shot top antibodies virus before. know technically haven’t proven it, two combined means likely higher potential immunity someone who’s taken one shot, right?  Yea unfortunately suck wannabe dictator. really blame Anyone who's ever locker room knows tend particularly well ventilated. Well evidently, according study absolutely prevent complications 100% time 

And regardless Pfizer Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&amp;J, Novavax Sputnik V cheap effective, easily stored embargo vaccine lot worse neighboring countries, response international travel Scandinavian countries like European countries south? mean people saying we’re going end death camps hyperbole whole idea social credit system coming far-fetched better believe right wing states would use part plan stop minorities voteing I'm international traveler I've shots go overseas before. Lots countries already require it. Adding COVID (or flu matter) mix gonna radical  states, hitting point people left aren’t going get it. There’s still super high demand states, ones opened 16 plus March starting run steam appointments easily gotten. I’m hoping states can’t fill appointments open state residents soon get moving along. WV highest vaccine rates country first it’s falling close bottom they’ve gotten everyone wants it. could open take PA VA residents much back rollout, it’s faster way get back normal. hospital network wife getting basically availability want beginning last week April, way last days. sure they're projecting surge supply demand falling off, really seems like we're approaching point anyone wants one able get one almost immediately. Speaking English nothing it. Understanding viruses work does. making several assumptions clearly show understanding whole lot attitude stems nothing.

Plenty drugs side effects discovered clinical trials completed, found cause long term harm unforeseen ways.

You're acting like I'm claiming leprechauns fairies real. think that's fair think arguing good never conclusively prove safety anything, assess certain degree confidence risk harm. 

I agree. years now, much confidence risks evidence beyond personal feelings hesitancy mRNA vaccines pose elevated risk harm?

Nothing concrete. likelihood, vaccines safe enough use without concern.

If obese elderly pulmonary disease, I'd probably already taken it.

But I'm healthy young enough. consider covid-19 significant threat. (Plus, I've already covid.) currently see virtually benefit unknown risk taking vaccine.

It's like, wondering around forest starving, found strange mushrooms, might eat them. starving, probably would keep looking food, know sometimes mushrooms dangerous.

Either way, evidence particular mushrooms dangerous. unknown.

We 3.25m per week March 2.8mill February. April meant like February.

If 3.1-to-3.2mill per week thereafter supply would actually increasing now. 4mill+ per week originally wanted.

If 2.7m per week next four weeks averaged 3.1m per week non-stop thereafter, we'd 92% adults first jab 18/July. amazing would nice university LA County could go back in-person learning. classes still online fall semester unfortunately. I'm 34 post-mba Manhattan went elite undergrad....95% friends atleast first shot already, remaining 5% within days....definitely feel like shot hasnt equitable lol. delay waiting emails causes things really fall radar.

We’ve saying “a months” year. seriously think they’re going give control? people wanting everyone get Covid vaccine think hospital death rates (as long looking deaths months ago reported) good, think states need get peer pressure put refuse vaccinated.

Yes, cannot, number truly cannot medical reasons extremely small. get selfish people whose sole objection ""there's *reason* get vaccinated"" feel would inconvenience. literally reading script video interview lol Canada needs reopening plan vaccine protect one 100%. would travel hotspot vacation visit country virus control. want relax stress.

NCAA DII cross country runner, healthy anyone age could be. Caught mild case Covid February. carry inhaler around mild case affected lungs much can’t breathe. also ECG showed abnormality speaking cardiologist. How’s fear? Well, fucking shit. Good ventilation prevents airborne disease spreading. Meetings. Work schedule. Collaboration Etc etc. it’s pain butt managing someone who’s work day starts wake 2pm time. everyone wants that. say like happy. cared provided social safety net like patriotic Americans even worry.

It's worry, though. Quit trying make people scared. could stay country they're vaccinated... thought fall semester person? wonder university still online fall likely miniscule amount active cases lockdowns place. healthcare severely lacking makes sense. Yeah. felt little pinch going in, headache around hour afterwards sore arm rest weekend, it. Probably people die blood disorders care. Actually, thank you. easy journalist days, someone trying get truth brings torches pitchforks sides. think COVID deniers, may never change minds, hope journalists continue reach facts, even seemingly obvious ones. There's real problem social media echo chambers get better journalists write people cease engagement. Besides sometimes good questions make good points. yet totality, case pandemic, they've led astray misinformation far often not. They'll never admit it, think skeptical, part, way cope pandemic. may fit certain worldview rather see scam take conspiracy theories give info think gives edge. unfortunate could result people getting sick/dying prolonging pandemic restrictions loathe point protest, etc. original point vaccinations clearly identified. aren't. big planet. glad feel good far states go Texas slightly average death rate. Uhhh, fine guess don’t trust anything say. Bush 9-11. “So I’m stupid, bad person, shouldn’t welcome public places.”

Nope. said yourself. shoe fits, go ahead wear it. know downvoted, thing AIDS. Side note, appreciate actual conversation we’re hasn’t deteriorated name calling. Thanks I'm surprised this. think school bleeding money grabbing room board cash. would think colleges desperate get students back  alternative referring to?  Take vaccine anyway. obligated deal someone's delusional mindset. Dressing sit cubicle thing home, forget it.  lol never said don’t go restaurants. said soon allowed attend restaurants time soon vaccine passports used.

Don’t want share proof vaccination? Again, going restaurants place.

I happily eating drinking restaurants please :) entire point. work place like China government controls life. US able needed find alternative less effective paper effective practice higher buy in. Thank you, I'm glad someone understands. Yeah it’s cute interesting. bit misleading....masking still effective, clearly *as effective* variants, reason *doubling masks* recommended quite time now, CDC others. ""Absolutely wreckless"" Hopefully step incoming travel US requiring vaccine negative test. many people, white house ruling vaccine passport step towards international travel resuming within next 8 weeks.  Well comment seems less relevant. Yawn think meant address concerns vaccinated people still carry/transmit virus. Whether concerns justified another question. That’s article frames goal study. amount lockdown needed make happen two months impossible. People would starve droves. you’d still essential workers would continue spread allow mutations. Chicago mass vaccination site pfizer, uber 30+ minutes way, wait really long. All-in, took 3.5 hours $50 ubers first shot. impact job, see convenience would important people. son watches Daniel Tiger lot. There's song one episodes likes. goes: ""Just keep trying, get better!"" link change view JJ vaccine. First seen described way. Thank sharing. Sorry, I’m selfish asshole. you’re putting people risk

No, not. realize whole point vaccination individual protection first, herd second, right?

If people get vaccine, reason ""vaccine passports"", protected anyways.

Unless course actually doubt validity whether vaccine private business

Lmao gay cake baker, say.  sure rest state seems like sudden there's significant surplus vaccines LA county surrounding. Tells people currently eligible want vaccine already gotten one. wonder April 15th date 16+ eligible could/will get pushed sooner. Half country hears ""Moderna vaccine works 6 months get two shots every six months!!!"" Got first Pfizer dose around 18 hours ago. Felt shot slightly sore upper arm/shoulder today otherwise nothing yet. need immunity virus gone. like one US gets TB vaccine anymore need it. Keeping masks is.... interesting. June 15th quite sometime, sometime May would better. 


Hope Simpson seasonality give slight rise cases late June SoCal. warning people. “CEO Kayak’s Parent”

Why say CEO Booking? trash headline article. It’s literally first paragraph too, CNBC thinking lmao logic came poor advertising. many different sources resources saying different things, familiar stuff, know. People looked data tell people got second dose trial multiple different dates (one person got 50+ days second dose). CDC needs clear, covering ass verbiage. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's preferred get 19-23 days first dose, wait, 42 days fine.  


Say way. Why, already vaccinated yourself? end day, feel comfy :) 

That said, know, etc, etc. open anyone starting today Awww 🥰 savor them. hear goes fast. used work one company 14 levels management president. Company got bought out, new owners came basically asked, ""Do line workers reporting you?"" yes, stayed. no, gone. Easily 80% tree gone one day business usual Monday morning everyone else. Although lot people also ditched houses stayed others power. Hernia mesh, transvaginal mesh add hip implants too. name more. talcum powder problem horrendous! Women died hysterectomies stuff. interesting point. timing trials location important. None less, still glad got Pfizer vaccine JJ vaccine. Perhaps rational, feel. Pure speculation. mrna vaccines effective variants. Vaccinate protection mind business. Me! miss things full time remote work overall I’m looking forward person least time. real question go club mass exodus. 

California ~40 million residents, decline 1.8% one year. steady 2019, increased every year prior. 

Florida ~20 million. It’s 2020 growth increased 1.12 2019, smaller 1.32 2018, even smaller 1.70 growth 2017. think they’re coming NY CA, you’re wrong. 

Texas ~29 million. nearly everyone moved CA NY. lmfao way different? Bodily autonomy medical privacy already civil liberties. link Swedish delivery projections. One rescale population get projections EU countries. everyone vaccine, acts barrier virus means less restrictions necessary. Public schools, concert venues, museums, weddings, bars, restaurants, outdoor festivals, farmers markets, grocery stores, etc. -- yes, everything private homes state can't enforce it. thought id share one coworkers concerned got vaccinated song stuck head LMAO doctor recommended take AZ Sputnik believes best vaccine take, I'd willing take AZ.

If end getting it, I'll pop aspirins anticoagulant case thank goodness 🥳 international visitors likely bring dangerous variants country QR code part vaccine passport app (at least one that's used NY). nothing CDC card. HAHAHA ikr think misread article. capacity limits theyre talking usual shit thats compliance fire code:

""In statement, officials said sectors included state’s reopening blueprint allowed “return usual operations compliance Cal/OSHA requirements common-sense public health policies place, required masking, testing vaccinations encouraged. Large-scale indoor events, conventions, allowed occur testing vaccination verification requirements.” right make sense. that's Newsom considers full reopening. Wearing mask club staying six feet apart everyone else there.

It make sense. say meant keep safe people subreddit claim anyone disagrees ""wants kill grandma,"" even every grandma country offered vaccine. say deaths trending say it'll 4th leading cause. contradicting No, posting 30+ sources may may quality knowledge interest going every single one search potential systematic errors, conflicts interest, ways differentiate subject matter hand. source substitute argumentation.  selfless enough mask up, social distance, quarantine flu season? Couldn’t someone like grandmother show paper vaccination card? wanna annoyed masks go it! described different NY's Excelsior system? article virologist podcast (this week virology) basically said hes confident variants dont shit vaccines cus cells essentially Canada giving second doses 16 weeks first scientific evidence effectiveness new method. Pfizer approved this. heck going on? think we’ll get 90% eventually age group. may take while. Seniors want things, even adamant know stats much risk are.

Other age groups maybe get 90% though. mini-crisis atm, anyone advice do, would appreciated.

I've first dose Pfizer appt. second dose 3 days. roommate informed feeling unwell lost sense taste, got tested COVID. I'm livid telling now, I'm obviously worried myself, even know begin appointment now. 

Should cancel it? allow get right? get tested? I'm unable get second dose long time 3-week date supposed get 3 days, less effective me? brain racing, ugh. Let’s use awesome sciency magic make extra vaccines fabrication plants running capacity running raw materials shortages. fuck expect happen? going moan resign.

Vaccines made somewhere. used people make communities. that’s done sent afield. don’t understand terrible.

If vaccines produced far evenly distributed every nation would less 10% population vaccinated. doesn’t sound helpful. countries produce lots vaccines become fully operational quickly surely that’s better everyone. Interesting. Try one bouncer next time get carded see response is. Hey that's I'll turn 30 reporting issue. lot agencies report holidays weekend. Even less both. got shot sunday. i’m worried increase vaccine hesitancy, feed conspiracy theorists, lead people forging vaccine cards. (already heard nyc.) General.

And 100 line flu. magically expire age 20, advised get booster every 10 years adult. 

Despite getting called anti-vaxxer sharing doubts vaccine passports, mine short ago good go next 10 years. also protect for, roughly, 10 years, say. course, get booster rest take vaccine, might worth anyway. People keep saying everything Newsom PR move recall effort. doubt he's afraid, still enjoys broad support California approval rating higher pandemic. subject, way easy huge waste money recall especially reelection next year. Literally everyone else risking lives go work without union, teachers think they’re special. job criteria lifting mask mandate CDC stop recommending masks. based time metrics. Unless cases stop rising next couple days, we're looking mid June earlier lifting restrictions. surprised Illinois last state fully reopen, Chicago possibly holding even longer. holiday weekend. Low reporting. Also, deaths lag cases weeks month. Cases could spiking really bad city deaths low... now. 247 infected 1.8 million fully vaccinated. Ah. Apparently can't read. Congrats vaxes. Hope effects mild. I'm new area, moved Philly whole mess working home really anywhere outside CVS, Martin's, Lowes, hospital. That's it... since July. said pretty apparent outlets one needs go appointment? Never there. I've hanging fish last nine months. Fish. Yay, maybe Michigan #1 again. Governor signed order morning banned state funds institution requiring vaccine verification 

This end badly, know private must qualify state money mean Toledo? Strangely quiet 🧐🤔 flu bigger threat young children that’s fact. Might get downvoted it’s true:

“The risk complications healthy children higher flu compared COVID-19,” according Centers Disease Control really, really fucking hope major surge happen Easter Sunday. 

Deaths trending down, cases flat drop next two months, due ignorance US coronavirus endemic. 

There good chance Coronavirus remains fourth leading cause death US next 10 years. herd immunity 80-90%

lol refuse believe disease contagious measles sorry add extra context. Immunize fully vaccinated. means two doses, except Janssen vaccine.

Example Netherlands (gets vaccines EU). first week July (so really end June, start July). 100% willing adults (85%) first dose 65% fully vaccinated then. 

This actually vaccinated people, deliveries. already takes account vaccination capacity, spillage, vaccines storage delivery vaccination delays. countries get share supply (some countries bet big Pfizer vaccines, mostly Denmark, Germany Netherlands), projections EU. 

Currently projection depends mostly Janssen deliver projected doses. know Moderna Pfizer reliable AstraZeneca basically worthless (in terms delivery promises), take account already. Janssen currently guess lots hope. Interesting comparing total numbers UK US. get rope burn behind ears wearing surgical masks. sucks sure. Feel free keep locked away refuse participate. probably gonna public places opposed private gatherings. Google Hope-Simpson apply northern tropical graph Texas, Florida, etc. I'd bet also peak cold flu season areas. Vaccine doses given 50% vs positive cases hospitalizations near zero fully open near zero restrictions. Kind silly make plans. It’s race double V’s: Vaccines vs Variants. everyone letting guards variants favored win.

There telling great terrible things summer. That’s I’m holding booking major travel plans. Would need sovereign territory build factories? billions dollars worth property Switzerland countries could put use vaccine manufacturing. I've always done bare minimum anyways I've lived sustainable basic life cause care materialistic things still shop need food millions people getting vaccine every day, I'm guessing manufacturers start shipping single-use vials like vaccines. reason already supply constraints vials. Really? actually serious? Please tell you’re joking, Nancy pelvis (keeping typo) co. literally politicized virus. claim one man killed 500K Americans. Last checked it’s virus killing people DJT. LOL Dude it’s everyday life. It’s concert venues sporting events open full capacity NOW, certain states only. gov guidelines place states venues way recoup massive losses past year. Stop overblowing it. don’t live one states fine waiting another 6 months guidelines place, doesn’t apply “freedoms” single argument overwhelming evidence. suggest look term trying use. Lawyers tell someone challenges precedent set. Even beside point we're talking principle practice. Illinois criteria reopening recall reading anything mask mandate lifted. However, Illinois interesting spot. cases rising among demographic cant get vaccine. Vaccine demand absolutely insane Chicago surrounding areas everyday goes easier easier people find appointments. would bet Governor projections doesnt want share them. Last year kind shit show gave dates missed them. Ah. Gotcha. disagree point all. think majority shifting toward wanting done growing resentment blatant gov control. last 15 months sus AF every facet, deffinetly going take *seems* consensus reddit majority actually feels Since live California. assure I'm happy. heart rate still elevated five days later! first dose. lots Palpatations thumping chest too. Prior Covid Government care cancer anything else. Look Flint Michigan allowed people drink bad water kept situation going years. Obama goes takes fake sip assure people okay. wanna tell Governmetn cares you? Gimme break. right! *high five!* Congrats! :)  got job! work assisted living home. hope get soon! staff vaccinated they're risk. missing something? I'm sorry never got chance experience happiness. 550k+ died USA compared UK 126k, America circus show 😂 much larger crowds USA compared UK comes protests. doxx it’s easy? I’m like 90% sure Twitter attached Reddit profile. Shouldn’t hard. 

The difference willingly providing information information taken force. doxx hacked, willingly reveal info. I’m actually victim crime scenario. 
Can apply logic things? 
If persons nudes leaked online, problem someone asking nudes. mean, it’s already there. 

See flaw? NY US large states different requirements. vaccine card protected health information. Honestly exactly thinking. I'm hoping state open announced double mutated variant SF.
Probably happen. concerned privacy even using internet LOL?

I bet FaceBook page cell phone LOL!  Optics. Keeping mask mandates safer politics revoking them. example, media (including Newsom) Reddit mob called Abbot psychopath predicted widespread death TX ended mask mandates fully reopened. wrong, aren’t listening brave journalists?!?!?!! get comment? mean, really makes sound like dumb asshole.  Yeah asked see one would racist lol. Ah ok, think masks subtly start disappear afterwards see state live in??? never reaching herd immunity. 60 percent country get first batch vaccine. Less get boosters. reinfections mutations, pockets US passing around next ten years. pockets places vaccine resistance high local population one third consistently vaccinated. Hospitals requiring vaccines FDA approved. work major one, many coworkers refused wouldnt mind that. NYC already piloting program validate 3rd party app use app allow private businesses say whether come in.  


If could show card pic card wouldnt care. dont like government sponsored centralization ""access passport"". seems like BS could go today's *New York Times*: [""As Variants Spread, Progress Virus U.S. 

*United States coronavirus cases increased hitting low point late last month, states driving upward trend also hit hardest variants, according analysis data Helix, lab testing company.*

*The country’s vaccine rollout sped since first doses administered December, recently reaching rolling average three million doses per day. new U.S. cases trended steeply downward first quarter year, falling almost 80 percent mid-January end March.*

*But period, states also rolled back virus control measures, mobility data shows rise people socializing traveling. Amid this, more-contagious variants gaining foothold, new cases almost 20 percent higher lowest point March.* rock-solid contact tracing, effective border controls, wildly popular national health care system?

If U.S. plus 50% vaccine uptake, similarities would striking. Oh population 9 million. 100% never said covid flu. never even said flu worse. said I'm personally worried catching flu covid. risk factors all, feel I'm likely serious flu infection serious covid infection. They're different diseases. people think covid serious is, people also think flu much less serious is. initial comment pointing invalid medical knowledge COVID-19. It’s flu. Full stop. I’m discussing further. went calling stupid bad person, never called whatsoever.

Don't that. know exactly did. implied know I'm talking about, implied poor character. call stupid bad person. implicitly. calling it. point internalize that. That's completely rude. say isn’t logic you’re correct. rule stands businesses uphold this. would illogical, like many rules throughout life. Doesn’t mean it’s going enforced. It’s illogical like phobia. Doesn’t mean isn’t real.

Right, kind enforcement really going have? case showing fake driver's license bar get taken cuffs. case I'm clearly wearing mask I'm asked leave I'm trespassing. 

If need be, I'll get make fake vaccine card. go business (again, probably illegal) turns away tell fake somehow, I'm going take stand throw tantrum, I'll go somewhere else thing. absolutely consequences illegal. *make* illegal another aspect authority government allowing businesses buy them. fucking wrong. Lol Gavin Newsom gives optimism ? extremely doubtful possibility Vaccinations probably far enough along safe enough then, I’d much rather see targets case numbers hospitalizations drop instead arbitrary date. feels like cynical bet Newsom win recall election. I’m confused. makes perfect sense need show proof vaccinations travel overseas. However don’t carry around participate everyday life. vaccine requirements everything else. 
But travel business minutes house area reside? Little bit asinine. require proof vaccination participate everyday life—and makes sense make so. 

Traveling oversees akin going private venue neighborhood.  Koreans already did...the KF94. optimism, bruh. could schedule one today exactly! kid would go Celtics games grab lunch, quit months ago went MIA. Work friends superficial sure! Everything Never still killed less younger people AZ Norway. 

Do source that?  let try 20th day, appointments available doesn’t mean parade around example everyone do, then. mental illness, seeking help, bragging it. guy contradicted employer, also medical professionals, hours later. spoke loosely, media jumped extrapolated conclusion proven. risks outweigh benefits vaccine? Quarantining days okay. putting disinfectant food packaging harm good. cases right new variants spreading restrictions lifted.

Shouldn't cases rising places restrictions lifted dropping they're still place? New title: *EU **denies** blocking 3.1 million AstraZeneca shots Australia*

This post locked information refuted denied European Union Tuesday denied blocking shipments 3.1 million doses AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine Australia, bloc steps scrutiny vaccine exports address shortages. Lol likely large begin with.

Pretending like getting everything delivered door somehow eco friendly beyond me. CCP overlords still find useful Following AZ vaccinations, four Norwegian women died blood clots brain. That's 1 per 20,000 vaccinated women. can't find anything discussion age, except 65. two 40, would already equal number Norwegian women died COVID. can't hurt. problems AZ seem adverse effects, efficacy. adverse effect four months ago, really matter.

But, again, can't hurt. Yes, cases Norway least occurred within two weeks. seen anything cases lately. I'm trouble finding source exactly said there, since Norway officially reported ages people died rare blood-clots receiving vaccine. also read norwegian, makes difficult. reported 4 people age 60, died way. see 12th march (the day AstraZeneca vaccine suspended) total 8 women age 60 died Norway whole pandemic.

I'm positive read something narrower age-gaps somewhere news broke, can't find anymore can't really considered reliable all. However, 8 deaths covid group people vs 4 deaths AZ vaccine still great, especially considering use vaccine suspended soon reports came light. covid that's harder do. Cases going is. says right page, URL posted within last 2 days.

"" community limits often link posted, link posted within past 2 days"" I’m considering playing hardball well. bosses much favor people come back (they’ve honestly WFH measures post-1st wave last spring), they’re insinuating we’ll required come back June July masking distancing requirements presumably get dropped vaccinated.

I productivity numbers tenure needed push back. won’t get promoted good it, won’t reintroduce office culture BS back life, massive perk itself.

Plus I’ve got wife kids, there’s much lose backfires need find new job. ""remote engineering""? we're concerned people phone, printer, mailing address, want go entertainment venue. Tough life. get ticket go venue? understand mean even scenario wipe everything (as OCD compelled sometimes still forget things learned therapy): you’re definitely still missing surfaces. Whether that’s missing corner box maybe Clorox wipe used little dry near end etc. Even taking clothes dangerous prospect scenario. washing face since could moving viral particles toward nose mouth otherwise going sit forehead. 

The surfaces didn’t wipe used keep night. Literally. 

But learn live imperfections. dick move still dick move. Fauci told double masks. love him. absolutely right allow whoever want. real question is, right access medical vaccination records? Thanks sources, appreciate EU dysfunctional usual. 

The way EU handled thier vaccine rollout disgraceful, people going suffer thier governments allowing EU dictate going aquure roll vaccines.

Looks like UK got right. I’m vaccinated. also don’t like idea vaccine passport domestically (I kinda understand traveling). Oh that’s never going happen. would require much company would retain employee except willing live rural Kansas. numbers much range studies find general population incidence low platelets gen pop even higher.

Both tend happen women aged 20-60 vaccination (at least Germany) people older 60 people medical professions, generally made way women 20-60 gen pop.

I think biggest problem whole situation EMA German PEI never commented comparing numbers never released data. claiming something goes published data support claims data own. Im clear issues surrounding identification purposes voting arent equal play vaccine passport discussion. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Looks like protective cup attached jock strap headphones. feel badly go doctor explain feeling help you. AZ vaccine last week, guys info look terms  low palates / CVT? know chances low I'm feeling anxious whole thing tbh, especially UK talking potentially giving 30s. even know means people like already, surely second dose would also AZ? would pretty unnerving take vaccine people age range advised taking. There's little info it, like surely thinking tiny risk make people aware potential signs prevent fatalities...but nothing. hear media/gov/health professionals fine, benefits outweigh risks etc. thoughts current vaccination supply numbers?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  contention increased authoritarian measures (yes, comfortable using terms loosely, even though admitidly hyperbolic) always mean permanent infringement, simply unreasonable wary things. Agree, loved ad!

(Also one Charles Barkley tells Spike Lee ""Pipsqueak"", digress...) repost also [refuted future, edit titles like changed Astrazeneca AZ.  think ok increase authoritarian measures certain times. That's rational position hold. position mostly disagree with. honest actually saying.

2nd reply different note:

I want ""go there"" main reply also honest doing? calling comment authoritarian trying paint picture statement make go ""NUH UH NO"" know authoritarian ""bad"" word. trying make argue/focus word make others think ""oh yeah evil, authoritarian evil"".

But reality us completely okay MANY authoritarian measures. many people think okay check passport ""prove"" really citizen crossing border? also authoritarian? using looser (although likely accurate) definition word most. 

When say authoritarian average person thinks Mussolini going DMV take eye test. authoritarian require eye test get driver license?

It's possible I'm wrong making assumption intent, feel like used word lead either others reading post somewhere. 

But yes I'll honest say think authoritarian measures always bad. like knowing people driving streets blind.  may change, unfortunately.

From 1,012 new cases Monday, Texas reported 4,966 new cases yesterday, highest single day increase month. (NYT). However may due lagged reporting Easter holiday.

The governor made announcement start March (just serious uptick, interestingly enough) takes time cities, towns businesses react announcements, public may wary.

If point areas keeping restrictions lower case numbers without, may well true-- Austin kept restrictions despite Abbott's announcement lower case numbers surrounding counties. i'm telling right passports law anyone supports lose landslide future elections. passport idea thrown trash... guess support goal change whos charge said wanted small gathering, stuff like this. arguing actual points making convinced dumber enjoying level human interaction. Yeah don’t scan every time enter building. normalize covid start checking everything else. population goes along normalized vaccines. stand privacy point. Instead saying ehh already database let’s let start checking papers door. think need specific. many people? percentage population? also many cases/deaths/hospitalizations considered back 'down earth'?

Also keep mind Texas opened eligibility vaccines last Monday. That'd true all. similar, Michigan likely Covid per-capita.

17k deaths 10 million people vs. 49k deaths 29 million people. around unmasked, unvaccinated people indoors still real risk catch it

""Real risk"" little. even extremely unlucky actually infected vaccinated, odds serious illness dying close 0%, since vaccine protects too. won't. got voted oblivion (over -30) pointing post provide evidence support comments

 '**Can provide evidence**' always huge red flag take reported large pinch salt.  worried parents grandparents, entire family got recovered. Grandparents got Pfizer shot full effect. We’re worrying much anymore. Anyone know would also mean they'll open immigration offices? visa pending approval I'd like go asap  Loophole Work tech, get job business people. January: We're almost there

July: ? done smallpox polio, maybe they'd gone! matter political affiliation vaccine rollout major success. hard believe early June majority Americans fully vaccinated. holdouts still wiping groceries, totally stop wiping groceries. Remember whole point lockdowns masks ""flatten curve"". curve flattened equally everywhere. Let's say 40% population destined get virus. State lockdowns 40% gets spread 18 months. State B lockdowns 40% gets spread 9 months. ultimately end level, cases front loaded State B.

It seems like putting cart front horse assuming ""40% population destined get virus,"" variable long takes get number. makes sense State B gets 40% 9 months, they'll higher percentage 18-month mark. software engineering. we'll occasionally go onto client sites. 3 deaths vs **thousands** among non-fully vaccinated population since beginning year. Ohioan fully support putting wall. Lovely strawmen got here! HEPA air filters expensive.

Subsequent article guaranteed ""hospitalizations continue rise, trajectory deaths still unclear""



One year shit nothing changed. took vitamin C + Advil break fever. 22 Y/O healthy male here. Fever lasted day, felt better after. CDC says quarantine 10 days first symptom. whenever first felt sick, quarantine 10 days then. Good luck, you’ll fine. okay :) photoshop &amp; Billiam Gates. kidding? AIDS snd Nash cancer Google coronavirus voting easy entering grocery store Chicago lol Yeah, actually that's exactly I'm saying could trusted always make best judgement calls need list protected people cant discriminate against. totally okay everything happened Kaepernick right? business business things heard bunch complaints people cheered trump got booted twitter(granted fuckwad Kaepernick great points) that's about. Horrible governor. Possibly worst we've ever had. 100% great idea. people get vaccinated long lines public, strangers literally watching get vaccinated. qualms telling friends people reddit. second say front business order potentially save someone’s life is... uh... worst thing ever? lol wtf?

also push everyone get vaccinated good Abbott motivated politics instead motivated protecting lives Texans like be.

I mean new. winter storm came went Fox blamed power failures wind turbines green new deal (not even passed) instead actually trying something it. often way, unfortunately. media really put headlines facts. also official seems spoken irresponsibly, it’s kind hard put blame media reporting remarks. supposed trusted figure. Hopefully gets sharp reprimand. Even musing turns correct, it’s rash proclaim evidence available. Oh see, mean ""engineering"" then?

Because traditional engineering fields require occasional site plant inspection, curious deal that. Yes, according law I'm reading it. understand difference show ""vaccine status"" every time want enter library vs needing prove vaccination school allowed go there. Reading though really leave room nuance though. place importance law, people use there.  Absolutely. problems state people, shittiest leaders ever seen life REGARDLESS political affiliation, consistently proven course pandemic care nothing money. Let's hope show gets cancelled soon seasons produced. Vaccine distribution awful PA, likely role it. number vaccinations looks high state, priority system use completely broken vaccination centers spread out. 

Everyone gonna eligible Mid April cause Biden making mandatory, good thing PA’s part. think know exactly wrong people getting vaccine (unless Dr. Advises get it.) far, J+J’s deliveries within US targets. question whether due temporary production ramp systemic issues...  wear 5 masks get anal swab well. Fauci decree  don’t know get data from, continent it’s 44 events 9 mill doses. narrow even look younger it’s getting close 1 per 70.000 Denmark+Norway (don’t know numbers countries). areas low covid incidence (perhaps genetic something north Europe also factor) it’s worth use younger. Denmark dropping AZ impact timeline ca two weeks. Personally hope unpause AZ 60’ies. sad.

The amount Covid deniers stalk sub spread misinformation unbelievable. thought might gotten better time sincee I've returned almost worse.
Is mods can't keep them? easy fake? need crypto algorithm government uses generate QR code. MD epidemiologist? 

No? Well then, opinion vaccine safe based someone exactly like this! Don’t give much credit, don’t actually understand numbers context exist in. need someone interpret data tell it’s safe not. guy seen data said it’s not. don’t take gospel, extremely qualified professional credentials speak authority. least, there’s need throw tantrum people reading article people aren’t outright refusing listen experts like are. outside SV rarely get $120k

Have source that? According BLS [1], median salary $107,510.

1. mispelled lunatic. Lol sure Talking me? got vaccine, thanks. think needs new term “passport” gives impression needed international travel reality it’s used domestic use. People likely getting cases 6 months longer.

It quantity sufficient enough justify anything larger local response, that. don’t think it’s FDA approved. 

Hospitals able require it’s FDA approved, imagine public schools same. Healthcare workers stricter vaccine requirements public school students aren’t required it, it’s I’m expecting Same. point covid vaccine longer experimental slightest Outside? 

Unless you’re hanging 50 people parachute kindergarten class style, there’s little worry about. Yep. business owners right refuse service matters impact others, that’s it’s perfectly okay business black people, Jews, gays, disabled people...oh wait... First even information yet, please read article. 

Secondly, point many lives saved UK compared lost EU due differences vaccine policies? Even UK lost handful people clotting even (a big still) shown directly linked vaccine really worth bigger picture prevent vaccinations EU citizens massively affect public confidence vaccines overall? 

On top UK react indeed young people risk. they've saved thousands older people's lives late change vaccination process young.

The willingness masks variants virus right spreading telling lack discipline still general selfishness society.

It's thinking getting disease instant death sentence. moreso idea wanting continue community spread infectious disease unknowingly. Especially something asymptomatic. well, maybe dont common decency Researcher Joshua Schwab University California Berkeley recently estimated doubling current vaccine allocation Michigan two weeks could reduce hospitalization admissions 10,000 deaths 1,200 July. concluded far greater reductions could achieved extra vaccines combined restrictions put back place. issue cards super easy fake. There's real way straight tell real not. pretty stupid. Given first time mRNA vaccines used disease vaccines given emergency approval situation hand think line refer ""experimental"" certainly suggest person kind ""agenda"".

Edit: English hard. provide certificate English least?

Not sure works, I'm sure that's issue. anyone whether vaccination would recognized EU countries? (provided get EMA approved vaccine, course!).

They giving AstraZeneca shots weekend, cannot imagine issue. German physician come get vaccinated couple weeks ago. I'm sure more, guy ended news segment haha  flu. suppose don’t know anybody lost parent COVID? Gee, thanks. yikes, sounds like Stevens Johnson syndrome, also happen Tylenol Advil btw. allergic vaccine, doesn’t surprise get that. us really picky bodies. Stevens Johnson rare kill you. Padma Lakshmi bad case it. forget prior immunity infection. Israel's data points 50% rough inflection point serious reduction spread. I'm tired Robbie! Michigan high compared similar northern Midwest states? I'm bit sad since vaccines report cards super easy forge. There's 'seal authenticity' anything Well guess would ""at gunpoint"", guess improvement. I'm noticing certain side political spectrum encouraging return awful lot, side treating dangerous scary scenario ""Neanderthals"" would want ""inexplicable"" reasons. I'm frustrated partisan nature restrictions looks like lasting even greatest vaccination effort human history. two sides sticking arbitrary decisions even reasons decisions fade relevancy. insanity. get vaccinated don’t care anymore, know don’t  consider movie theater fully open required blindfold. would consider concert hall fully open required wear earmuffs. 

I understand like wearing mask. 

1) Wearing mask interfere watching movie hearing concert like blindfold earmuffs would;

2) also matter public health, unlike those. like requirements shoes restaurant, like examples. 

3) ignored said, like ID's bar. make bar ""fully open""? Spread who? unvaccinated people, assume risk choice vaccinate.  


Once people universal access vaccinations, give weeks take, end restrictions, full stop. passport needed. “No one truly safe COVID-19 everyone safe.”

This statement happy scientists won’t making public policy. Covid zero going happen.

There thing “everyone safe” ANYTHING world. pretty calm. yes would no. Skepticism great thing. think conspiracy theorists apply skepticism sources ""official stories"". Sometimes feels like conspiracy theorists believe anything long contradicts mainstream viewpoint. necessary?

no "" study, yet peer-reviewed...."" article talks big game, present actual epidemiological evidence supports variants anything detail vaccinated populations.  I’m saying don’t work. I’m saying people don’t think risk worth Covid over. don’t know. I’m scientist. Insta-downvoted 33%. Astonishing. international travelers vaccinated Unless aren't... 

I'm boat he's in, except (maybe) oldest asthma breathing problems gets ""normal"" respiratory virus. Even though wife vaccinated, far us. \^this lol. People love working home much easier is, theyll use alot excuses try lose it.

Trust me, like working home too, reasons, every job going stay 100% work home. That's vaccine efficacy data works. Unless saying 100 percent chance contracting COVID 19 friend prior becoming vaccinated.. case guess line thinking logical.  Well conditions, vaccine might enough. instance, EU vaccine passoports EMA approved vaccines non eu country citizens cant choose vaccine get. get Chinese ones Sputnik wont able travel EU. really really hope right tho.  feel flu? Again, difficult problem solve. piece paper individual QR code, essentially long number. scanned compared database. simple e-ticket may print theme park pass. second person cannot copy e-ticket get would already scanned, fake work. anyone tried? could interesting choice, given slow German rollout. anyone whether vaccination would recognized EU countries? (provided get EMA approved vaccine, course!). provide certificate English least? aka normal fucking kid problem also choose ignore fact vaccine documentation totally thing past (granted, travel, still needed ""yellow card"" prove vaccincated CDC guidance. get immediate allergic reaction shot hives, get second dose. reacted fifteen minutes. bad anaphylactic already taking antihistamines. Second doses allergens also worse. say recommended, mean followed fancy primary care triple board certified doc speaking CDC nurse advice. I’m risk bad effects Covid too. standard protocol clearly, it’s hard find anyone experience. One doc’s certifications immunology. trust want hear others’ experiences. Give consequences follow continues. Tell discuss further, needs respect choice continues leave/ end call etc etc. figure that? 
The numbers days behind, 2-3 weeks? don’t think so! Ha, forgot still places haven’t full reopened. joke. New York, Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania New Jersey I’m surprised they’re even giving citizens choice, especially considering among many things they’ve sexually assaulting people en masse mandated anal swabs What's metric threshold believe mask mandates go away? 

They going last forever. FIL today said we’re going wearing masks years more. 
Will necessary? Im understanding why.  UK government likely expecting get output Halix plant paid expand. Originally output supposed delivered September last year, December 2020, March year, then... EU blocked exports.  

We're still getting Pfizer deliveries, though full 40M due end 2021. 


Output Halix plant around 5M month. 'up to' 20M doses intended come plant equivalent least two months domestic production. 

So UK government approached India 10M condition affect contracts, got 5M India blocked exports. 

The goal counts get everyone least first dose seasonal uptick begins again, roughly October. Vaccinations important, masks groups size limits stick around infection rates drop near zero.  post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Haha, either joking they're getting really desperate scare people. stigma un-vaccinated, however... Agreed, absolutely reality mask mandate rest lives guy crazy. keep checking various vaccine sign-up sites, every single one shows availability 2 days now, always totally booked day. let book dates that?

Ive worked jobs lots cool people, noone connected with. Silly think idea people working great people friends crazy idea.  I've got yellow paper booklet that's used vaccination passport 50+ years; back medical information noone would even think faking. Lots handwritten notes, including ""lost batch sticker vaccine dose 2/3 administered 26.04.1988. Stamp&amp;Signature, family's general practitioner"" (and withered PostIt note: ""make sure lose sticker dose 3/3. Take dose, necessary. Signed: GP""

...the good old days medicine less political issue... make workplaces places business responsible keeping people exposed virus, republicans begging us forget ever opposed this. 

How make responsible? safety regulations. Try meet safety requirements someone get needlessly injured business see well that. 

Basically, minute people sue win airlines flying peak covid causing loved ones die, passport “very good reasonable” thing. wrong. science hasnt changed - masks work go Georgetown in-person on-campus living except athletes nursing students clinicals. bit ridiculous.  ~~this way.~~

dis da way sure. UWS filled old people shop groceries Zabar’s. Definitely older neighborhood Murray Hill West Village. complete BS. come one addressing things back pre 2020 normal?? metrics needed reach point? hope great time. rest us favor keeping exposed self Texas. it’s also generation remembers early polio vaccine incident bad batch vaccine killed crippled ton people giving polio. news J&amp;J manufacturing fuck ups, don’t surprised skepticism alive well age group. Ya P.1 actually notably less resistant B1.135, live virus studies shown that. However poses problem it’s highly transmissible likely reinfect convalescent individuals Point United States Rona. reason changed Covid especially dangerous. vaccines make Covid much less dangerous, everything else 2019. People aren’t suddenly afraid diseases now. risk calculation goes back used be. effective enough substantially reduce risk place like nightclub, allowing places like nightclubs reopen masks. effective, point requiring majority people vaccinated. Yep. vaccinated would spread around pretty easily, passports would helpful, especially easing restrictions. would reason fudge data? Tough shit, anti-vaxxers. countries already requiring proof vaccination proof negative test enter: yet nobody leaves apartment blows mind company's best interest let employee work home. Smaller offices, less resources spent (electricity running office computer, etc). Plus happier employees statistically significantly productive.

its easy. jobs translate well virtual settings. Yeah agreed November US election, poll workers convinced senior poll worker convinced get vaccinated. strictly social distancing last year. little fence easily persuaded. 
Now there's another local election, asked received vaccine yet, said no. said gotten call local health clinic can't get appointments priority him.

Tech barriers part him. previously asked online account health system, said no. told unfortunately would good way assure got appointment time seniors eligible. Unfortunately, time come passed health system never got around calling still trying contact seniors appointments, weeds general population get appointment.

I suspect vaccinated vaccine widely available enough next time sees doctor person office, able offer vaccine office visit. goal incentivize vaccination

By telling people ""common sense"" masks stay ""post pandemic life?"" makes want ignore vaccine tell everyone know bother. literally never happy live California afternoon. Vancouver (and Canada generally) pays low salaries

Relative West coast North East US really. 

Compared pretty much everywhere else, Canadian salaries great.

If someone's immunologist wants tell something specific weird, that's fine, that's contraindication coming FDA. said, 100% immunologists rheumatologists I've spoken told patients run vaccine sites. won't. Seems optimistic say near zero, even vaccinated people pop hot virus, even though they're almost guaranteed asymptomatic. 

As long widespread testing going baseline positive cases. 

But get you. disagree setting date bad. set one expect take improve public optimism. got start positive way things going bottom going fall people give up. 40% adults fully vaccinated today? seriously doubt that. revealing something post that's part problem. Masking mandates ""long term"" April 19 NJ vaccines available 16+!Hope point places might start changing tune plans summer fall. I’m hoping guy runs activity school schedules camp august, although heard cancelled someone. I’ve really looking forward I’m practically praying it’s happening, might send email like “yo time camp happening everyone group 16 vaccinated Covid little enough worry make camp safe. Please don’t cancel.” shows lot that’s specifically worry point, anything closed school closed again. feels weird someone crippling phobia needles also pro-vaccine. Like, everything body telling I'm going die get shot, that's excuse ignoring science. replies thread WILD. goes show selfish people - I’ll masking (and I’m vaccinated) know sure I’m risking others.

It’s fucking piece cloth people acting like “we’ll wear masks rest lives”.....wtf people dumb?? dinking, mask. dancing talking, yes mask. everyone else around gets vaccine like virus firewall. 72,000,000, 21.84% population. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 95% chance getting virus, 100% chance getting severe illness.   Best guess:

The prime-time infectivity virus trying outrace immune system it’s replicating like mad nose throat. it’s gone lungs, vascular, it’s contagious.

The spike mutation probably helps exponential explosion; naively, effective nasopharyngeal infection would lead deadly vascular infection line.

I don’t think deadly variants likely, since danger comes spike. Begun, covid wars chance? sure. likely? no, really kind straw-man argument. 

Mask mandates California (everywhere country?) always exceptions eating drinking. ""nightclub"" argument really thing real world. arguing rule cover specific example arguing. giving timeline masks. Neither Illinois. That's problem. workplace lack ventilation probably violating OSHA rules regardless pandemic. damn white people, go again!! seriously suggesting never go back unmasked venues public risk diseases general? I've sanitized hands 2020 entire life Ya politicization whole thing, coupled dumbass online conspiracy theories, really warped people’s views reality. Haha thanks take government money business. get whatever government says want keep getting sweet, sweet taxpayer dollars. That's catch taking government money. Nice, I'm working I'll sign this. Thank thoughts giving timeline based upon greater percentage population vaccinated. 

Personally I’d rather mask mandate go bit longer needed rather taken away early brought back. 

I wear one day work. sucks. nurses I. I’m told don’t wear one. I’m putting back Or, put another way, close schools means sick people stay work, healthy parents too. entire workforce gets reduced skeleton crew duration school closures, including important services like healthcare, groceries, deliveries, pharmacies etc

It's simple closing schools letting kids play Call Duty home 8 hours day instead. kids 13 so, need parental supervision, parents people contributing functioning society. worried Brazil's situation concerning high positivity rates low vaccination speed? chance 2 combined could end mutation make current vaccines non effective? think ever large gatherings people unmasked? inherently risky epidemiological perspective point people going want go back normal. think realistic vision mask mandates going go away here.

There going order CA summer says ""no masks"", hit summer less less people wear them, enforcement, kinda go business order quietly scrapped. medical data? Whether vaccinated?

Who cares? nefarious thing done info Open today 16s open 30s starting last week expansive definition pre-existing conditions meant like 75% people could get one wanted one.  reddit people upset private business rights, remember: Government money always comes strings attached. EU proud unwilling spend/invest. Absolutely, time infections dropped near zero. I’m sure happen together, right we’re still increasing daily new cases. It’s soon set date get rid masks start partying, I’m optimistic happen soon everybody wants shot get one. 40% TODAY. makes think can't get another 10% close two months. Get outta fear Why? I'm get paid earn living. I'm make job career life identity. time friends connections outside working place, people actually like spend time with. 

Most people like separate work life, forcing friendships co-workers one easy way blur lines work life. also allow exemptions requirements practically reason. going start West Coast vs East Coast Manhattan covid wars? college literally started walk j&amp;j shots students today. appointment required. $500k even rounding error.

The current ones work, people wear them. Michigan vaccinate first? That's worldwide. Netherlands similar thing, expect good news tomorrow around Christian world haha. Yikes, wonder things like indoor nightclubs back June gone Indefinitely also... New England states already 80s 65+ Vermont leading way 89.9%! I'll interested see much varies state end. don’t care tracking. really ask you’re okay vaccine passport it’s never needed Got first Pfizer Sunday afternoon, felt fine first, weight training workout Monday work started feeling I’d call mild hangover. Nothing much all. Took day half pretty good workout feel much anything.  younger, seemed like people pro vaccine.

But lately seems LOT people anti vax.

Now , know valid reasons, lot dont.

Anyone else feel way I'm sure meant anecdotal evidence asked data. Dude relax mask taking actual ideas, words would never happen. really outrage banning something would never happen woman passed along information said CSU Bakersfield excess doses enough local interest opened up. drove two hours get teenage girls vaccinated.  farm clicks, certainly reflects agenda. Lol true interesting see cdc govt low hanging fruit plucked. everyone wanted vaccine. 

Already seeing ""outreach"" type things mainly aimed people color social media newsfeeds.

So far carrot..Will stick come out?

But far local govts go? spend millions got stimulus bill door door vaccinations? pop vax sites there? buy 100,000 van like california city did..to trot council members air port lol. respect realistic. person asked, it'll community spread low enough threshold vaccinations high enough level. know exact number public health expert. Well tells naivety British public that's feeling is. 1 shot across half population end happening. life next years. 

Progress vaccinating many great, I'm negative here. bit realism situation needed. Nobody able say sure people still transfer virus even vaccinated, there's still lot missing data. agree. June 15, pretty much everyone California wants vaccine able get one. There's reason continue wearing masks point Thank you.  pretty easy give people info? sure afraid... Wearing mask scares much?  title misrepresentation EMA's statement. Guardian really poor here. sounds ridiculous. Even major production problems enough vaccines vaccinate adults August/September. things *don't* go according plan *everybody* wants vaccine.

The cost benefit analysis anything whether things fully open. course there's benefit masks - somehow mean things fully open people wear masks mean things fully open 2 months capacity restrictions lifted restrictions (like masks) still place.

We required masks gyms, example, pandemic, despite fact absolutely effected ability people use gym main purpose. get ignore detriment deciding whether something fully No, point. really point. fit argument want ignore nothing sort. asked think business ""fully open"" check ID's. so, according something like Bars movie theaters showing R rated films never ""fully open"" first place, pre-pandemic. disgree strongly that.

Yeah, ignored that, dumb point. Obviously standard pre-pandemic normal ability people engage activities manner COVID restrictions put place. can't enjoy gym bar way (well, you, hypothetical person goes gyms bars) pre-COVID, they're fully open. Agreed. I'd still rather permanently fuck lungs, though. Waiting reopen herd immunity, rather daily hospitalization/death threshold, way go governments national institutes health several countries already thing regards AZ

And what's wrong that? Sovereign states perfectly entitled decide vaccination strategy even share vaccines states.  unclear whether Australia plans ask Britain United States ship AstraZeneca doses.

Shhh fit narrative. missed it, 2/3 die within 3 weeks first shot second shot? 2021, segregated place America church pew. Monitor carefully. unusually severe headache, unusual bruising feeling sick warning signs. doubt got see doctor get blood test. see clotting factors weird stuff. medication things. go early cautious. onset disease 4-16 days vaccination.

People's fetishes masks really weird. ""They"" haven't. Maybe explain patiently I'm willing to: good point! also young healthy get vaccine right country, US. I'll probably fully vaccinated middle summer. context, 1/4 adults US already fully vaccinated almost half received least one dose, I'll one last. then, continue attend concerts get airplanes, want get virus.

I think people unvaccinated ""denied service"" grocery stores whatever think reasonable require vaccine legit medical exemption high-risk activities like flying attending large concerts. strong antivax sentiment US, think we'll need apply pressure get high enough percentage adults vaccinated.

To honest, imagine catching covid could also cause unnecessary stress family working adult, imagine would want avoid high-risk activities vaccinated? Nobody knows studied, considering similar Pfizer &amp; Moderna are, I'm speculating could probably arrange timed way gives much protection two doses Pfizer Moderna themselves. Highly unlikely would *more* effective considering Pfizer Moderna 90% effective themselves, protective vaccines get practice. never know media 1 3 evangelicals non-white.

I'm big ol' lefty find hilarious Texas continues kick thing's ass. Especially we've deal obnoxious praise people like Gretchen Whitmer Michigan good job putting ridiculous restrictions everywhere. Okay I’ll explain simpler manner: no, required law private business without way get vaccinated everything else. entirely possible go without participate everything society. grocery store, movie theater, hobby store, anything requiring proof non covid vaccinations. even walk hospital ICU without proof measles vaccines. 

You accuse shifting goal posts, made 100% false claim. Actually comment read 'died due blood clots suspected associated AZ'. 

As in, know people clots, link AZ directly causing yet confirmed. exponential! hereby declare Dr. Seuss longer illegal Texas.  would totally okay that.

Most governments assume many people fake risk another surge. Like cold/flu season? applying rules corps take public money. hey take public money, makes government stakeholder. Would interesting read find really get it. Normalizing ""carrying papers around"" shit never ended well. Take Tylenol after, before. say negatively impact immune response vaccine need smartphone. Print QR code. hard. Could even QR code sent everyone mail excuse. ID's physical tickets still required many events, sure would different. covid die surfaces instantly? possible touch face mouth wouldn’t get it’s surface? forget vaccinated individuals help unvaccinated well! wait 2 weeks ""triple mutant"" people also higher risk others. get you’re crusading empower low risk take risk worried shut-ins. guy broke math thread (.9999) chance getting 5000 contaminated touches that’s (.9999)^5000 60% getting it. 50,000 touches contaminated surface there’s .07% chance getting covid - yes less one percent. Midwest usually get 100+ items shopping trip touch least couple times they’re put away even they’re delivered. 

If warrant illegal stuff car (preexisting conditions) might choose drive 75 70 versus 85 like everyone else is.... matter perspective. believe ASHRAE established new standards HVAC. school ventilation systems need upgrading anyways. Even without ongoing pandemic, cold/flu season probably exacerbated poor ventilation schools. Well also article says evidence claim provided... keep missing fact guy vast majority- high income. high income people know got great educations hard work. waste money crap. 

You definitely confusing typical 50k year guy engineer FAANG company. good source info. EMA denied this. appreciate government. country government neither approved ordered Pfizer doses. Many many people afford prefer it. Major cities capable refrigeration.... Yet Yes else whole school would infected, parents kids would infected then...

You get picture. Medical information. right. colloquially correct stating additive also formally. responding people thought meant arithmetically add probabilities (which would approximation what's going on) check terminology. Wow Reuters, nice clickbait. It’s “plausible” clear link. It’s still 44 9.5 million common young middle aged women. They’re looking link birth control DUH! think business' open regardless anyway, opinions matter. me, nervous stay home vaccinated, open businesses live life usual. part got vaccine also think country open 100% anyway, whatever, need passport saying got vaccine. got twisted guests vaccinated. would get sick?

Same reason outbreaks measles airports disney world. Titers wane time without boosters. scared liberals.

It's somewhat empowering know good person threatening crazier ones among us. sure know this, Covid last respiratory disease outbreak. Ventilation good learning, research shows classes air conditioning retain knowledge much more. *But merely adopted dark; born it, moulded it* simple division 44 9.2 million came 4.782e-6 chance clot issue literally .000004.7 0.00047% chance happening right. right saying freak driving accident way likely happen considering blood clot issues younger women man taking vaccine even safer clot problem. tough one pro mandate folks follow science on.

Lots canaries gone coal mine come healthy canaries. EMA contradicted official said link found stage. Seems speaking turn, incredibly reckless behavior part medical true Europe too, practically everywhere flat curve then. Fair enough i'm wrong risk assessment stopped using it? ban seeming likely. Don’t question vaccines take them. What? hate science? Yes rare side effects show days week later easily overlooked initially link vaccine might always immediately obvious. happened vaccines past like H1N1 vaccine 2009 rare side effect identified many months later. reason Biden pushing Vaccine date two weeks posted? old news something?

Or post getting deleted? Canada (15.55%) 3rd G20 behind US (32.4%) UK (46.52%) % people 1+ doses.

They manufacturing capacity. Exactly. much likely die covid time refusing AZ vaccine receiving alternative die vaccine-induced blood clot. risk low worth worrying about. think AZ alarmism political bias much particular apolitical media bias toward novel exciting/alarming information. could even replacement vaccine. Whatever dominant strand could ship next. Might anything boosters anything. may modified keep dominant strands.

Pure speculation part case clear. took mother-in-law get shot last month CVS, worker getting telling everyone reason wife threatened leave him, believe vaccine forced get it. acting like policy normally adopted across US time. literally never happens. true. often difficult realize Reddit hivemind laughably bad representation population whole. Print it. People need carry tickets events get many cases provide ID, could part requirements. Pretty sure rocket scientists use excel lol.

(But agreed.) Great! need make vaccines mandatory then. I'll get new one implanted perfect ass jeans anyway wouldn’t put getting vaccine first? prove happening? Thanks saying that, definitely helps. week still headache I'm pretty low energy nice idea roughly it'll gone. vaccinations 100% effective* obligation support public health can't control body does. 

The non-aggression principle breaks cellular level. way controlling cells mean proteins filled genetic material. getting vaccinated option inherently aggressive act. different shooting gun air hoping bullet kill someone falls back down. 

\* Yes, includes hospitalization death. 0 deaths hospitalizations Pfizer JnJ studies (there two hospitalizations Moderna study) mean 100% effective placebo groups 5-10 hospitalizations each. Real world data Israel shows protection hospitalization death Pfizer vaccine anywhere 87-98% depending dataset looking at. still wear one one knows I’m vaccinated. It’s still scary see someone mask. 40% least one shot 40% adults 

Right. might helpful clarify OC it’s accurate; friendly suggestion. true - vaccine efficacy percentage lower risk unvaccinated.

So 95% means 95% lower risk unvaccinated person. absolute risk (for Pfizer, Phase e) 0.4%. 0.4% (1 256) prevent serious case.

It mean works 95% people 5% remain risk. I’m anti vax, genuinely curious. self quarantining herd immunity feasible? know don’t timeline solid percentage need hit yet. I’ve enjoying isolation mountains partner. get vax would require bit travel, apparently there’s solid chance you’re knocked days second dose. honestly wouldn’t mind staying put next winter. expected. Within 6 weeks, able drop nearly restrictions resume normal life, given rate vaccinations cases deaths falling places.

Quite contrary, we're ones failing vaccinate citizens. Texans need them? 

Because Texan grant immunity. Duh.

This different. decision reduce herd immunity put others risk yours, businesses tell don’t want plague rats scurrying premises. brain Murdoch propaganda congrats! happy get 2nd last week hit nerve? old place spent half million upgrading HVAC... yup lol. concert sports venues airlines? grocery stores establishments? really think deep ""papers comrade"" order enter everyday common places good idea wont ever abused anyone? like all. 

If government mandates every person gets vaccinated, fine.

But defer authority corporations instead. 

This decision company business making. There's financial incentive so. liability infections happen premises. people getting sick vaccinated. 

We're talking transmission willingly unvaccinated person another willingly unvaccinated person. two people willing accept risk, anyone's business two them?

I'm anti-vax. I'm positive they're safe. phobia needles. I've never even gotten flu shot. I'm personally worried catching flu covid. want it. government going make me, absolute bullshit fucking Wendy's could.

Well, can't make mandatory law, refuse unvaccinated people private property :) So, earlier week (maybe weekend), saw post article someone UK NHS basically discussed COVID endemic need learn live it. specifically, conversation comments may seeing ""birth"" enedemic coronavirus strain, likely throughout history dealt coronaviruses... 

But life can't find post article. 

Any help? record. everyone travels spend winter sipping mai-tais beach.

There many folks sides border need travel for:

* Medical care
* Family Care
* Work
* \+ host non frivolous reasons. 

Trying lump travelers category rich rule-breaking vacationers disingenuous. Mac 🤦‍♂️ unfortunately stupidity ntue world become accustomed too. Man would really like see doctors get spotlight. downright primitive media government appoint one guy job. Also, changed opinion several times. need committee doctors media working together publicly. Wish knew earlier buying Lysol I've ever owned life reality vaccine protect infection high rate.

great point! Official statement coming later today, according Danish media. Sports venues, concert venues, airlines, etc. Already common over. Additive would mean add probabilities together directly cannot do. Everyone knows binomial distributions except two people mentioned expect 50% chance getting COVID touching 5000 surfaces. agree - math checks probably way could convince go venue like theater indoor restaurant pandemic over. Canada problem. infrastructure ready pump 60 million vaccines need build them. then, we're stuck taking whatever USians Europeans spare Ok continue think let know things going Europe whilst I'm pub next week. Nobody said additive. said, probability/risk go up, beginning almost additively. State mask mandate lifted Indiana today, excludes schools, businesses wish keep it, local cities/towns want still enforce it, meaning entities still required wear masks. 


Anecdotally, seeing people grocery store, gas station, etc. wearing masks. Hopefully vaccines win race fall time. vaccine manufacturers haven’t met half promised quota.

Australia way behind vaccinations also don’t need barely cases, let alone deaths. Daily cases flat. MHRA EMA give different advice, gonna make things worse IMO. need page offer simple, clear messaging proceed going forward. EMA suggests limiting gets MHRA don't, trust authority erode. 40% Adults, kids eligible Summer earliest. Devils advocate: seasonality may driven primarily temperature, behavior idea private entity requiring proof vaccination - evidence directly helps assess someone's risk causing sickness someone else - somehow *worse* *forced law* show government issued ID full identifying information (address, birthdate, height, weight, eye color, whether need corrective lenses/glasses, on) penalty law absurd. 

I saying many people parroting lines like vaccine cards erosion rights start ""papers, please"" ones line support completely useless overreach like Real ID might help catch terrorists (it won't... sure hell helped government make great facial recognition biometrics database photos!) help deport terrible, terrible immigrants lived peacefully US 15 years. 

Proof vaccination least direct, tangible item directly impacts around you. Something like Real ID - *actual* rights erosion government overreach - not. 

Again, saying - I've seen cognitive dissonance places real life point. I'm also nervous even though probability low.

Don't be.

Yes, believed small risk risk tiny everything life carries risk.

I imagine probably worry eating meal restaurant yet 180 people year die food poisoning alone UK.

Evaluating small risks something humans terrible - people scared flying driving. Neanderthals Survey population 655. exactly telling statistic. People middle ages burned Jews Jews wash hands thus sick much thus must responsible spreading diseases. strawman argument, slippery slope argument. AZ OX vac much failure. company, UK, world. 1/3 people vaccinated people know many people vaccinated be.

My worry would also drop record low! trials rate cases started diverge control group around day 10 increased plateaued 14 days.

[Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine starts work 10 days 1st individual level definitely want assume protection day 10 might start see impact population vaccinated people point. Covid taught people little common sense. joking? 8x put ‘little’ aside? 3 years earns would taken 24 years Italy. personal representative Schwab helping invest avoid taxes, HSA fully funded, 401k limit.

The problem bad example points. scale income normal calculations don’t work. We’re banning ideas now. 

*idea government mandated vaccine passports aren’t weren’t fucking thing* Company stated voluntary, happen. Funny enough was. family ate outside Palm Springs 110 last June. actually wasn’t bad, ones eating patio. week later indoor dining stopped cases began rise everyone else eating outdoors. Lots Australians crapping correlation isnt causation. Trust experts. Calling anyone concerns antivaxxer. came read ""private companies right admit whoever wish"" crowd claim violation civil liberties. 1. one walking right border, people cross detained. 

2. Texans stayed Texas, fellow Texans ones suffered decisions, personally wouldn’t care whether got vaccinated not. don’t stay Texas though, people places Texans might travel right see hard work sacrifice flushed toilet outsider doesn’t believe science. I’m actively getting pounded second moderna dose it’s serious I’d take side effects covid day Well already know golf fine! Yes! talking point about, vaccines prevent severe disease, fuels hesitancy. People interpret as, “why bother? still get sick spread it.” reality vaccine protect infection high rate. course isn’t 100% protective, it’s good vaccine history. I’m talking mRNA ones least. nonsense. None vaccines 100% effective, we'll never reach point *everyone* safe. Sage even using justify extending restrictions next year. what's endgame? UK stay lockdown forever? point individual need make choice: want survive want LIVE? might stupid question called ""social"" distancing? I'm always disappointed level detail stories. One person quoted said people vaccinated, indication vaccinated relative infection, vaccine number doses. 

The person quoted mentioned persons became infected ""fortnight"" second dose, timelines circumstances little vague still. live Alabama buy theory too. Boots ground reporting here, quite lot state stopped wearing masks February cases watching anyhow. Hospitalization early April levels state. say mask wearing down, even suburbs restaurants go staff even wear masks. 
I think actually hit magic herd immunity, vaccines coming mop rest. county 11 percent population get covid, near 40 percent positive percentage various times year. would bet actual infected percentage around 50 percent. No, political dispute UK! /s that's frustrating. Israel indicator it’s around 50% population one shot. current rate happen beginning may making sweeping generalizations based one (second-hand) anecdotal account? Maybe standardized version vaccination ID card would good start... Instead piece paper. news, water wet He’s going around comparing salary many non American countries think he’s trying brag pay don’t think he’s actually anywhere else saying much makes people countries.
And like buy hot wheels think rest now. also thank Marissa Mayer took Yahoo made everyone working remote come back started moving industry bring people back site. probably using one online calculators take account fact we're getting amount doses April Q1. Canada they're one dose, spreading three four months get second dose. Canada legit fucked up. welcome. mean, everybody reddit said production dispute Hahah dont believe reality. Germany currently vaccinating around 200k people day, unless dramatic change dont see happening. bad people work refusing get even company literally bringing silver platter.

While many struggle find appointments, work going outfit come factory vaccine hand dole out, people going refuse conservative media rotted brains. There's also mundane aspect robocalls making Americans wary answering phone. get call number contacts list, likely extended warranty car sort gift card scam. None hyperbole. act like government world stuff like this. know answer, also somewhat immunosuppressed since take Remicade Crohn's disease. least last time researched it, big concern immunosuppressants might reduce efficacy vaccines. Officially still get vaccine offered you, unofficially sounds like immunosuppressed absolutely try get one two dose mRNA vaccines simply give headroom.  difference 75% efficacy 90% efficacy much bigger people large realize. mean single dose? might 66%-80% efficacy people thought 2 weeks first dose. much changes months single dose even less understood afaik. Probably Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Tuesday government expects 25 million Spaniards to fully vaccinated coronavirus late July, confirming end-August target inoculating 70% population. ""The pace vaccination will accelerate April and month improve vaccination pace previous month,"" Sanchez told press two weeks covid done me, I’ve got vaccine second wave started. need Finally didn’t say made wrong choice. It’s still possible reach right answer calculations full mistakes.
I’m pointing premises incorrect choice (regardless whether it’s “right” “wrong” one) based miscalculation. 
It shouldn’t difficult concept grasp plenty people make right decision wrong reasons. 
I pointing claims 1) doesn’t pay health insurance 2) doesn’t need safety net, false. 
In way ever imply take Italian job instead. 
But informed would allow plan ahead, example. clearer understanding situation allow shift “I’m 100% fine way everything going right now”, “things great, there’s always chance things might go sour I’d better plan ahead contingencies- I’m making 8x before, able put little extra aside case”.

As statement “he afford health care” goes, you’re falling exact trap I’m trying highlight him. afford NOW. doesn’t need it. happens if/when loses job? Then, no, wouldn’t able afford unless plans ahead.  say fairly normal? can't international travel? EU yes problems mostly related AZs piss poor delivery performance (in combination betting many eggs basket local governments)

But EU first approach would problem many countries. 48 million doses various vaccines exported EU soil 20201, 10 Mio going one way Brits, 8 mio Canada (which get single dose USA GB meanwhile) 10 Mio Mexico etc.... would go EU first approach well lots countries would seriously f\*\*\* up. 

In meanwhile British US press hammer us bad vaccine rollout, speaking hypocrisy!

Even 2 kids school wont get shot probably june even likely AZ still prefer open EU approach first everyone else die approach, one world hope Canadians, etc.. wont forget this! come never tried good ol head sand technique? /s Fair enough. gave bad example. one certain. School districts tiny bucket money play lots expenses cover. Upgrading HVAC systems may highest thing priority list. 

Given unlimited funds, course! true, held events 40,000 people yet? ""I've done math.""

Wow. scheduled begin vaccination general public July earliest. health workers border workers get right now. agree! I’m baby get tested going hospital, wear mask nurses doctors room (ie: labor, sucks) yet I’m fully vaccinated. feel like get little freedom I’m fully vaccinated?! don’t even ask. yes sub full people can’t handle reality. Sorry, know fact you’d never died covid? Abbott throws red meat idiotic base time. years ago idiots convinced Obama sending US military Texas overthrow state government aka Jade Helm. Abbott actually bought stupid ass conspiracy theory. 

Abbott one worst governors. think approach reasonable. think right curb spread, need target spreaders first. 

I suspect primary focus rollout strategies reduce death hospitalization numbers first, trying get herd immunity. Downvoted semantics (vaccine causes *production* piece virus rather containing it) otherwise true. news vaccines get job: literally required decades now. try getting job healthcare without vaccinations. 

The alternative allowing vaccinated people return live without restrictions keep restrictions enough people vaccinated hit herd immunity.

Where heck think eugenics came this? Every sports venue know digital ticketing option go call arrive game paper ticket printed day-of. terribly inconvenient go game smart phone, is, generally, still possible.

My big hobby theme parks would hugely problematic use cell phone get in. leave car go theme park want bothered I'm fun (that half work around airplane mode) want risk losing roller coaster (that part cannot short spending money locker every ride). It’s nice know actual argument. hope bunch movies coming soon still theaters time I'm vaccinated... ""We know"" answer too. is, ""Masks help worried panic buying want make sure HCW need."" that's exactly Microsoft - localizing wages.

It make sense pay SV salaries outside SV. stopped sanitizing cold groceries four months ago, although still try little careful using wash hands handling them, (mostly) avoid using non-cold groceries.

I started getting concerned could harm good using disinfectant wipes, like bits disinfectant could seeping pores plastic packaging (especially thin plastic packaging) could end damaging health (read articles suggested possible).

But get still continuing careful. Even risk low (and I'd still like see studies CDC using updated guidance, longest time saw couple studies basically said 'it's hard proper tests, know aerosols pass more'), reducing even seemed worth me. Depends exact Ad used.

Also, major uses approach would [cancer extremely concerning.

However, mRNA replace them, it’s maybe bad. Well, people choose get vaccinated baseless conspiracy theories would choosing put themsleves class. really civil rights violation yourself. People legit cant get vaccinated allergies medical reasons still get vaccine passports, qr codes, whatever option afaik something people want permanently. way safely open concert sports venues full capacity right - We've already lost sooooo many venues pandemic. there's way safely open, support lose more. irrelevant medical information situation asked. context matter. Yeah don’t understand whole push. I’m vaccine passports checking vaccination status meantime we’re path towards herd immunity, get everyone vaccinated doesn’t matter small percentage people aren’t vaccinated nobody dying even getting sick. We’re going get herd immunity quickly seems like complete waste time resources this, would bet would herd immunity months vaccine passport systems even rolled out. see hospitalizations time statewide across Texas within regional service areas [Texas Covid-19 Hospital Resource Usage wife pharmacist small town. ballpark numbers here.

Norway population 5.3 million averaging 2 deaths day past 7 days meaning 0.4 deaths per day per million COVID 19.

UK population 68 million averaging 35 deaths day past 7 days meaning 0.5 deaths per day per million COVID 19.

Situation really dire UK either. didnt call antivaxx.

But situation definitely used antivaxxers definitely say ""see vaccines cause bloodclots"" also grateful AZ vaccine roll achieved.

No argument regard. Current CVST issue aside, clearly effective vaccine. others too, means luxury choice, investigate things further. Everyone know got pretty damn sick Pfizer/Moderna. Like bed ridden day two. One guy headaches weird came back crazy elevated levels white blood cells lab test. 

Everyone know covid mild cough, sniffles. Chill.

Whether that's risk worth taking you. course traveling get vaccine 0 risk either.

BTW, solid percentage herd immunity ever, herd immunity depends effective R, depends behavior. Also, overshoot number time infections keep happening herd immunity reached take quite time. like goes 70.53% whatever noone gets infected ever again. Infections get fewer fewer immunity grows. fact Texas dropped it, highly publicized criticized nothing happened good indicator everywhere could same. I'm sure, barring scandal recall something along lines, I'd imagine going somewhere September-January. muh vaccine! Tylenol help? increase capacity based vaccination rates hospitalizations? US successfully it? Proof vaccination get quarantine. Hence acting incentive forgeries. 

People upset vaccination status doesn’t matter (help) border. 

Vaccination status doesn’t matter (help) border it’s easy fake, people shown fake documentation it’s easy so. say virus vaccine incredible varied reactions are. folks know who’ve gotten rona definitely didn’t enjoy it, meanwhile ones know got vaccinated felt crummy day don’t think anyone bedridden. felt pretty fine shots, never really get reactions shots injection site soreness. [Almost: *nearly Mine's little buggy, firmware update scheduled download 3 weeks. Well 10 years implement it. I've real ID since 2014 so. That’s argument authority.

He’s comparing one day last week one day today.

Meanwhile rolling seven day average cases per CDC, hospitalizations. 

Rolling average standard much pandemic due non-instantaneous reporting cases/deaths. getting Pfizer moderna, sure get second dose.

please pretend like polio covid even comparable Exactly vaccines enough? Tbh isn’t expected? still giving small amount first doses, ensuring vulnerable fully protected. still hit government’s goal every adult offered first donation July UK administered 30+ million 1st doses seen 7 deaths attributed blood clots, total. 2 1/2 months. Thats significantly less 1-2 deaths per day Covid. 3 various risk groups. something people want permanently.

The point give government sort power, never, ever give back. happens COVID vaccination becomes irrelevant medical information? entire adult population opportunity vaccinated stop requiring vaccines enter places? wait teens vaccinated? wait babies pregnant women? wait every backwoods hillbilly living grid gets shot whether want not?

If we're still trying coerce people getting vaccinated daily COVID deaths flu deaths, hard reach see companies government employ tactic get people comply stuff. Even benefits society, still wrong punish people getting voluntary medical procedures ostracizing certain parts society. Last year April 6th 1526 reported deaths US

Today April 6th 530 deaths. 


Deaths dropping steadily. think happening, we're starting see effects vaccines action here. Everyone 16 eligible vaccines yesterday FL. hope so. Cases started rise already. speed limits stop pushing accelerated car. law create 100% compliance, mean try.

It's well good deciding got COVID risk factors we've seen countless times stop passing people die it. know right concede let companies whatever hell want fuck what's worst could happen. nobody's forcing carry papers, even get vaccinated begin with. arguably civic duty so, legal consequence. want talk strongarmed due power businesses, corporations employers citizens, that's different discussion. Let try asking clearly I’m interested thought process here:

If business wants proof you’re vaccinated, wouldn’t go different business doesn’t ask proof? prevent 100% complications get what's deal? like there's pfizer moderna world use. don’t know else really say really appreciated got vaccination. I’ve watching numbers feeling optimistic feels much real now. too. forget get vaccinated. go exchanges get dirt cheap unemployed heavily subsidized. talking biden clear helping create program leaving states decide uses program. state already requiring passport. result businesses arent getting money. literally spouting nonsense every thread U.K. obsessions unhealthy, I’d worry mental state actually gave damn you. Troll gonna troll. U.S. largest concentration pharmaceutical companies world. course much easier ramp production, small country like Australia. Making vaccines complicated pandemic low priority even pharma companies (because little money made vaccines). Even AstraZeneca practically zero experience vaccine production prior Covid. reason got produce Oxford vaccine political decision keep production UK rather depend countries. sorry, unfortunate situation, remember science isn’t definitively set link vaccine &amp; blood clots, even extremely rare. Godspeed  case, yes. Requiring vaccines social events isn’t good idea available years ago, funding upgrade earlier Plus graun. certainly not. Young people ""life death"" situation regardind Covid all, ethical give vaccine potentially serious deadly effects safer vaccines. Yes am. sick adults acting like children. vaccinating society 100 years. want part society give little personal freedom everyone safe. believe literal propaganda feel like victim. canceled: [In pop culture, canceled means make someone something irrelevant due current guys still pretty shuttered? Agreed 

What medical reasons can’t get vaccine? then? original studies wait long enough, far effective first thought. US government not. Texas zero ability impose NY, vis versa therefore it’s level worth discussion. Unless Tx order says NY passports, would interesting. much shorter version better post made, but:

No, really isn't.

We mardi gras 2020 right mask mandates stay home orders put place. critical lag sure, probably caused lot problems, early early pandemic agree bad optics, pandemic sometimes choose two less stellar options. 

Option 1: Junk vaccine entirely/ wait months testing it

Option 2: Send countries need vaccines, acknowledging slight increased risk blood clots

Which option leads less deaths short long term? That's need federal government step require vaccine passport many things essentially forces states comply.  Vaccines work yes side effects. Everything life comes risks. saying vaccine 100% safe. saying man saying something without giving evidence. safety vaccine, countless study already many case ? here, missed BMI qualifier checking CVS website daily book wife I. disinfect groceries? I'm sure wash fruits veggies warm water, people actually putting disinfectant food? mean, still better sending vaccines all. vaccines save lives blood clots take.

It necessarily need AZ vaccine, everyone absolutely get vaccinated. young people refuse vaccine.


Nobody obligated risk death vaccine especially vaccine literally kill you. Maybe people risk group still worth young healty not. possible Phase trial determine vaccine harmful side effects.  Sweden? so, get notified cancelled?

So clear link title suggests? Local media always going start running fearmongering vaccines brings clicks eyeballs. way backfire R states. chance. way representatives going standing vaccine passports hand trying argue black people denied entry grocery store absolutely allowed vote. known while? thought determined back like May surface contact realistically common mode transmission?  Yeah terrible advice. million people followed advice, significant number would die.

It's even debatable. Anecdotally, nobody know able pick vaccine want, assigned them. Imagine logistics gave everyone choice. 50/50 two different kinds people chose 80/20 whatever reason etc. already struggling logistics think they'll give people choice. suppose 3 dead number concerning. Would useful get detail age/health conditions/date infection etc. I'm mean last count, 18million AZ jabs resulted 7 fatalities 23 cases clots. that's across age groups 50+, along younger risk people. 1:600,000 clot, 1:2,570,00 fatal incident. I'm pretty sure anaphylaxis higher risk. Jesus money already? passed funding stuff! Unless aren’t US Nobody forcing injections anyone's arms, relax lmao. Businesses venues right refuse service unvaccinated want. choose get vaccinated, that's fine, entitled enjoy services don't. That’s straitforward.

Cancers common specific cancers exceedingly rare.

Let take HPV case.

The vaccine tremendously effective, given entire population, there’s little actual effect men, although men take role preventing cancer.

In fact, cancer vaccines make dent inoculate big portion population even people reap gains it. 

In theses cases, vaccines needs risk-free, individual gains small. There's lot middle managers know justify salary everyone working home without issues. can't cause fix issues easily could office. Yes, covid statistically less-dangerous typical influenza season.  get grocery household needs one shipper one shipment require extras?

I'm doubting can't done well (very inexperienced thank humoring providing details), feel like often folks rely ordering things need piecemeal. 

If one crucial grocery gets forgotten, require additional shipment?

China virus control domestically. I'm sure like selling vaccines using part vaccine diplomacy, want even pandemic end, economies open back people start buying made-in-China goods boatload again. positive vaccine news good China. point american history required prove vaccine records leave house

Saying won’t able leave house without proving vaccine records definitely fearmongering won’t happen one proposing it.

What I’ve seen far places like NY businesses ask something like want, like taking temperature door. second longer need spend money paying someone that, they’ll stop spending money that.

Saying need EO Texas prevent Texas government requiring vaccine passport fearmongering guy passed EO guy would decide whether state government facilities would asking vaccine passport. North Koreans credit, absolute zero Covid cases. read NK press. There’s reason shouldn’t except idiotic governors like Abbot Desantis turning important vaccine requirements culture war nonsense. Vaccines required large high risk congregate settings like colleges voluntary institutions. not-yet-vaccinated person know vaccinated?

I went gym last week sudden, mask compliance worse been. Maybe people vaccinated, maybe not, want get sick I've chance. people get resurrected too. I’ve heard referring people wont get vaccinated think bill gates gonna micro chip them

Do realize people really believe that? That's like fringe fringe. lot people, however, questions safety vaccine emergency FDA approval made companies sketchy histories, especially companies zero liability. things mentioned anything current covid vaccines companies

Isn't kind big deal? McDonald's got caught knowingly selling big macs asbestos them, would argument ""well put quarter pounders!""

For record, I'm anyone getting covid vaccine want it. think forced anyone. Nah Biden said something like 11 million doses coming think last week ""only"" like 4-5 million it. Im curious weeks closer 11 million, like 5-6 million. knows - maybe another 400k week. J&amp;J super inconsistent deliveries far. Pfizer/Moderna well oiled machine point know expect 


From understanding mix wont really affect timelines (so PR department says) Obviously choose, schools, universities, employers, airlines, cities, etc. choose require it. came see ""private companies must shut year"" crowd suddenly care private property rights. Nothing terrible happening. like flu season, old already sick people died, deaths rare. causing trouble fear pandemic. president work around restrictions making almost every bussines essential, would much worse. economy Starbucks, Costco Microsoft, OK... Boeing probably took bit hit though :) would rather not, would drop phone. Denmark, 41. According current schedule, get first shot late May early June. did, ain't showing nobody ever. Nobody needs know personal life obviously don’t see irony comment. Whatever. long don’t lick green wallpaper :P selfish person.

hence pending divorce. stayed in, dont go out... 1 day vaccine test positive... idk many others infected.... J&amp;J kicking ass right now. got vaccinated late yesterday afternoon, woke 2:30 morning freezing, roasting, freezing again. Splitting headache, chills, fatigue right now. I’ve never noticeable reaction vaccine before. Thats everything open started testing ppl like ""shit many ppl it""

It origional exponential growth US (I think, armchair analyst) think people avoiding vaccine ignorant?

We know work. Plenty us educated. master's degree related scientific field, I've taken graduate level courses nanotechnology biochemical engineering.

The Pfizer Moderna vaccines creating colloidal suspension trap mRNA sequence lipid nanopartical.

The J&amp;J vaccine uses shell dead virus trap mRNA get cells.

That mRNA sequence encodes spike protein SARS-Cov-2. idea being, nanopartical viral vector keep mRNA stable enters cells. cells, ribosomes read mRNA synthesis spike protein, triggers immune response create anti-bodies.

It sounds great theory. far seems work pretty well. exciting technology possibly astounding medical applications future.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* feel you. hesitant first vaccines seem rushed, none fda approved. 

After research reading, fears quelled made appointment. (I couldn’t gotten jab sooner I’d wanted to, tbh. Even medically vulnerable couldn’t get shot first town demand hospital high. it’s like delay cost anything.) 

I’m partially vaccinated. Lmao, Jack SCMP posts chinese propaganda. Starring think guys simply dont like chinese period. Nvm, starting think it. know it. Imagine actibg like US embargo nit worst siege human history acting like US isnt worst human rights offender world. mixup terms might affect first dose projections? people already there. parents fully vaccinated already gone 2 trips. Life normal important ways them. think anyone ""happy"" wear mask, responsible thing do, continue least next months, least majority vaccinated. nearly life changing enough stop close woods finally. Yet got vaccination card yes? acceptable allow people freely choose divulge information private company?

No one sub talking people 'freely choosing' anything. v-safe participants reported injection site reaction (dose 1: 70.0%; dose 2: 75.2%) systemic reaction (dose 1: 50.0%; dose 2: 69.4%) days 0 7 vaccination (Table). frequently reported solicited local systemic reactions first dose COVID-19 vaccine injection site pain (67.8%), fatigue (30.9%), headache (25.9%), myalgia (19.4%). Reactogenicity substantially greater second dose vaccines, particularly systemic reactions, including fatigue (53.9%), headache (46.7%), myalgia (44.0%), chills (31.3%), fever (29.5%), joint pain (25.6%).

For lazy pretty sensationalist headline given country North Korea. specific protections discrimination based sex, race, disability. Everything else fair game, companies refusing entry wearing mask. critical mass people vaccinated yes, kill grandma.

Unless medical exemption get shot. they've made point send medical help parts world crisis situations. CDC says technically accurate, easily misunderstood facts. take time craft message right way. 

""No evidence COVID vaccines stop spread"" ""While believe vaccines effective stopping spread, yet able confirm. do, safest course action act prevent spread."" going choose believe true.  Another year assume meant. again, compared what? evidence logical reason believe child gets covid randomly develop damage random point future. logic assume vaccinating kids. I’d sure hope not. real alternative hell guidelines. them, yes.

The reality private businesses (employers), universities, schools (eventually), airlines, federal government, cities, etc. still require them.

A minority percentage people refuse vaccine, despite consequences, get vaccine vaccination card. I’m similar spot right now. Whole family vaccinated be. parents convinced they’ll get variant that’ll surpass vaccine asymptomatic vaccinated person, die result. brother’s left front door 15 months believes he’s fated get long COVID (no seriously, thinks that’s fate goes outside). 

A lot people issues paranoia, agoraphobia, etc. develop get worse this. isn’t much that, especially aren’t becoming threat themselves. see people normal stuff, think they’ll start come around. parents actually started going stores again, agreed meet family month - big steps, since they’d previously bet strictly isolated fall. Tetanus shot hurt hell lot first Moderna one. I’m back “wear mask everywhere times inside house” city month place really expected one inside business. fucking hate it. anyone say HIPAA violation? Sounds fun! think already sure thing enough vaccines US may. fine, 40+ million unused doses sitting shelves right another 20-30 million coming week next. right 80-100 million unused doses confirmed already. Unless plants stopped producing right (three different companies different supply chains) plenty vaccine everyone. seen risks death severe illness lowered, definitely seen 100%, especially vaccines. also still risk mutated strains. Oh will! 

My state kind sucks vaccination rollout, I'm dead end list (24, COVID, health issues), plan getting ASAP can.

I little curious I'll traveling week. concerning given much South America using vaccines similarity P1 variant SA variant. got second Phizer shot yesterday fully expecting feel bad first. Honestly I'm little tired today sore arm - nothing like much like shit felt first dose. Hmm. Waited line. Got shot. Drove away. proof whatsoever ever happened. Wow that’s pretty good considering Michigan at. Compare 1.8M non-vaccinated see great is. somewhere pretty good outright stunning. Especially consider 117 infected (they data 129) 11 hospitalized 3 died (all 65). plain remarkable. misinformation masks Asia still amazing me. ice rink day one TVs showing 2018 Winter Olympics South Korea. saw maybe one two people crowd masks. It’s “everyone wears time” thing. there’s pandemic, masks used they’re sick there’s poor air quality. comply state’s mask mandate spend rest life masking I’m sick. Note cases reopening metric case. oh lol, yeah definitely gonna low, though think would 'lagging' imagine lot places would applied doses open weekend surely gonna rough weekend. I'm NYC though, want authentic heartbreak experience Yeah, would problem ended happening. think it'll happen.

On one hand, even mutations diminish vaccine's effectiveness, looks like it'll probably still protect serious infection boosters urgent. hand, [scientists guessing virus mutate several different since mutations keep recurring independently - might continuous chain new mutations give boosters all.

And then, happen years road, there're lot groups looking different mRNA vaccines COVID's proven viable platform - there'll probably lot manufacturing capability soon anyway. Lollll like honestly even think look whether saying true? Trump said hoax big deal, Democrat fear mongering make look bad. absolutely made R v thing. song Dawsons creek. Ya know, ""I dont wanna wait.."" stuck head that's.. fun guess. county I'm already 65+ 89.4%. came make sure made sure. Nah yesterday they’ll go back normal sparse attendance South Africa already approved Pfizer. initial lab-tested reduction efficacy would likely put level J&amp;J, therefore threshold. B1.135 young population, preventing severe symptoms, hospitalisations deaths far important South Africa. 

I’m happy that, irrespective 800-strong study released positivity rate placebo group lower 3%. simply conducted whilst SA generally low positivity rate, whilst J&amp;J coalface severe surge. Would still 100% comfortable taking Pfizer though. really matter much. personally would choose Pfizer one heard less severe side effects. fine choices. logic I'm gonna need 7 8 vaccines, pronto. idea vaccine passport **to take part regular life activities** 

I emphasized would understand point.

Never necessary show proof vaccination enter bar attend concert, yet we're heading.

Stuff like traveling foreign country going public school different. True... still think timelines based upon vaccination rates though. X percentage population gets second dose, we’ll open everything back 2 weeks then. May force US! gonna lose 550k games  200,000 michiganders total tested positive timeframe... without even math I’d say that’s pretty good point thread ever ""lockdowns"" efficacy. ever give thoughts said ""lockdowns"".

Nice try there, bud. Go peddle bullshit half-assed arguments somewhere else. trialed J&amp;J feel 100% safe (after 57 days efficacy reaches 90%+)

However... choice would choose pfizer due data Israel. Agreed! someone moved around lot 20s, making friends coworkers new job new city pretty much friends had. friendships stopped coworkers stopped, I'd rather short-lived friendship friends.   comfort pub bonus get keep drinking Pfizer county live reach 1/3rd vaccinated today tomorrow 1/2 within 3 weeks. 

Feeling pretty good One helluva 3 weeks flatten curve   Yeah way lot people going snap wallets hit. I’m supporting business institution tries continue restrictions everyone ample time get vaccinated.

I masked distanced pandemic, weird social engineering experiment. suggesting coronavirus going ask pronouns are? think 90% possible, think would surprised many elderly people still figured get appointment. Many tech savy even use internet, coming months get point walk vaccinations around country GPs office. getting vaccine simple going pharmacy pick prescription offered spot.

As happens could see us approaching even exceeding 90%. 

This also generation still memories horrors polio big believers vaccines. Variants exploding across Canada 5 days:

P1 doubled 737 March 30 April 5th BC. 

P1 tripled Alberta.

B117 doubled Saskatchewan.

B117 soared 73% Alberta.

Hockey pandemic danger, shows theyre losing control situation. 2000 cases two days less surprising bunch millionaires getting it. it’s creeping elite wealthy circles, it’s going much worse ordinary working folks.

It also shows transmissible P1 variant is. spread far group people tested regularly take whole host extra precautions (e.g., private flights; leaving hotel rooms socializing team mates' hotel rooms road). spreads like wild fire there, imagine quickly spread schools, workplaces etc. constant surveillance people relaxed about/don't access kind preventative measures (like high quality masks). talking low dose administered numbers article quotes 6 week delay. Canada right operating SIXTEEN week delay. aghast lack rationalization doubling extended time.  weird works, live 3rd biggest México city, everything open without masks, clubs, parties, casinos, cinemas. restaurants, bars, everything open full capacity week 10% hospital occupation 2 months now, feels like restrictions reducing cases virus nature love mine...equal better filtration N95, no-fog, lot manufacturers adjustable straps mask stays mouth talking. Under-promise over-deliver. This... Search Etsy ear savers get generic one Amazon. little strip fabric silicon buttons straps go around. Seen lots nurses use it.  Thats works Yeah I'm sure last longer, I'm wondering going play long term. Obviously 7.6 billion people need yearly booster prevent another pandemic lot production capacity going needed. 

Obviously everyone rightfully concerned getting first dose seen much discussion regarding medium long term strategy. I'm okay vaccine passports long implemented everyone chance vaxxed.

For example, June 15 little doubt anyone wants vax Cali get one. point, getting it.

But implemented vaccine passports, say 2 months, go gym, that's unfair. guns doors? college something similar, hybrid learning. Hopefully changes I’d upset didn’t. class full vaccinated teachers students doesn’t allow us live normal college life, don’t know will. What’s worse college students already highly low risk sacrificed enough virus yet still going need taking precautions lot places might thought one function vaccine:to reduce risk death particular virus. called yellow book certain vaccines required certain countries. Definitely, something transcends Covid. doesn't. numbers WELL within already stated efficacy vaccine. fact, numbers BETTER stated efficacy. 

While certainly, monitoring rates infection population wide sequencing going necessary on-going process, ZERO signs data variant overcomes vaccine. yours? dont miss coworkers all. form connections need via calls. Plus, people judge much based appearance clothes etc nullified remote. also communicated colleagues remote need to. Otherwise, person, get work done rush complete commute home pick kid. I’m sucker punishment I’ll keep trying teach you. Though think already suspect wrong you’re scared show working.

What you’re using additive rule probability. wrong formula give wrong answer.

It doesn’t use multiplication. 1 + 1 = 2. (There multiplication symbol formula, didn’t multiply 1 * 1 get 2.)

Your way, 2 touches 2/10,000.

So 10,000 touches 10,000/10,000. kept adding.  100% chance catching covid touching surface 10,000 times.

That’s right answer.

That would saying 1/2 chance tossing heads. two throws it’s 1/2 plus 1/2 ... 1. You’re 100% guaranteed get heads two throws.  agree correct?

The additive formula want work odds “or” problem.  Odds rolling 6 3 1/6 PLUS 1/6 = 2/6 (or 1/3 rolls 3 6).  That’s says “or” formula.

If “and” question, need multiplicative formula.

The trick work odds not-becoming infected (or throwing heads).  coin, it’s 0.5 odds tails first throw MULTIPLIED 0.5 odds tails second throw.  0.25. 25% chance tails twice row. means 75% chance got least one heads. Doesn’t make sense 100% chance?

Same repeated touches. two touches multiply odds infected (0.9999) odds infected (0.9999). Repeat touch. first 0.9999 close enough 1. 1.9998 close enough 2.  10,000 touches big difference. masks perfect people wear eyeglasses fog worn correctly. Never said anything dying it. referring getting really sick/long haul covid. life. [Lincoln Park, Old Town, Dunning, Portage sure mean question. Requiring masks makes lot sense people required wear entire time venue.

Requiring allowing people take eat drink makes sense since sabotages protection got. matter wear mask going take get sick anyway. guess forcing college students get meningitis shot attend schools ridiculous well Hall Director junior year (when RA) Baylor kicked one women's basketball players (Odyssey Sims, 2nd best player team Griner) hall move-in verified proof vaccination. sure one, yeah, ridiculous people realize already standard every university.

Although, maybe mindset coworkers college liberal brainwashing avoided costs. absolutely devout worship masks certain side political spectrum incredibly bizarre. many governors pushing mandated masks remain rest lives? feel becoming anti masker- everyone wants vaccine get one, hell continue hiding faces? normal scary many people okay it. long keep mask mandates require vaccine verification indoor events, think that's way accurate descriptor.

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree. Everything open....

Just clothing standards certain caveats, mean something open.

Do consider restaurant ""fully open"" require shirt shoes? movie theater fully open require people certain age see rated R movie? Bar fully open check ID's door? 

Because seems like argument here, judging reference recall, I'm guessing using politically-motivated reasoning. Right get vaccinated ASAP. make superman put odds greatly favor. What's disturbing article align stats see elsewhere. says 40% American (adults) least 1 dose 25% fully protected. Bloomberg link shows 32.6% 19% respectively. I'm sure correct... either... Bloomberg link one I've considered authoritative, far. distinction seems ""adults"" TheHill link, since says one quarter adults 60 million, total 240 million, elsewhere show population 331 million. Still... 91 million non-adults? everyone talked penetration need reach herd immunity. understand count infants, count 240 million people? so, herd immunity around 75%, 180 million people? would sure lot closer done, so. Hmm. cases deaths nosedived, I'm excited go visit UK one day. Im big Arsenal fan dream always watch Arsenal lose person earth going there? going say cdc says really need link them, article Governor seems hiding lot things last year. Also article 8 months old.

Right? people inconvenienced requirements designed keep us safe, they're welcome stay home. People otherwise would’ve turned nose would complaining trying get appointment lol annoyed masks. seems like exorbitant amount design new mask current ones work fine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Agreed. statewide mask mandate ended Texas couple weeks ago, plenty people still masking places go to.

I'm guessing Memorial Day I'll seeing significantly less masks Texas, it'll gradual change. right. want go fucking movies already  laughing, toddler trip.  don’t know they’ll ever allow true “just walk get it” like flu shot unless find vaccine stable punctured. People always need grouped 5s 10s within hours. Politically can’t allow hundreds thousands doses expire nationwide consistent basis. go in. WFH everyone most. go kick boxing class, work home, son more. Go beach work , shit. Really hope requirements large events changes. Really point restrictions hit mid June/July, vaccinations flourishing. Young kids won’t vaccine yet. 
I’m curious see protocols stay place then. gish gallop thanks. Maybe people feel stigmatized obese try addressing obesity ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Yes, people medically unable to. majority folks throw hands air, coming excuse explain obesity besides living unhealthy lifestyle calories calories out. someone gets asymptomatic case means they’re gonna catch (at least long period time) Except there’s retractable roof going fight SF based employees want work home want Kansas salaries. without regulation, corporations always win. US policies line pharmacies followed US policy, since federal government directly providing vaccines, run sites followed policy. would imagine something similar would happen. Probably numbers lagging holiday sunday help keep fans socially distanced 110 degree days. mean indoor dining obviously need mask bars allowed open max capacity make sense either. big feeling many mask mandates turn retail store public transit type thing able make choice whether wants take risk going out. risk tolerance isn’t someone else’s vice versa. 50% adult population general population?

Also, would re-open 100 people dying per day?   Canada never reached 200k per day 7-day rolling average going down, up. id say mostly people got taste working home dont want lose that. require information already maintained somewhere though? far know there's national vaccine database, maybe missed it? Well, good news mostly vaccinated Moderna Pfizer. 

What i'm worried vaccines shortages, provinces delay two doses order protect maximum people. strategy seems effective B.1.1.7. partial immunity fare P1? Thankfully, seem good South African variant evade immunity, still! apologies. confused another user making analogy doesn’t fit. 

But agree point nightclubs venues. places nothing. 

As effectiveness. shown slow spread better anything else we’ve got save vaccine. average age UWS also higher, probably vast majority qualified reason age, chronic disease, etc.. still carry spread it, infections unvaccinated individuals. 

It's important remember learning go one, erring side safety worth saving lives for. going reaction usually vaccines. I'm concerned want follow different vaccine. Newsom's idea post pandemic life means continued masks large gatherings. might well tell people bother getting vaccinated since lives never come back.

I really hope big names side political spectrum condemn this. would choose spend rest lives living fear disease extremely effective vaccine against? What's point? There’s going national stockpile refresh always need face masks hospital surgical settings. Might well see can’t make better version there’s ton money attention thrown industry. Hey, least skin start peel whole [The force people pretending over, like almost everyone sub, continues greater force accelerating Interesting. think happening Netherlands: graph shows daily ICU admissions percentage winterpeak (100%). absolute amounts, clearly shows ICU admissions changed age group compared earlier waves. interested absolute amounts, look [this think fine call reopening they're removing restrictions operate.

Is tricky thing say yes without added context. say yes, felt required say ""yes, authoritarian defined as"" average person would react certain way.

You say increased regulations. ""So think okay increase regulations bureaucratic burden certain times"" something nature bring bad connotations. ""So think okay add extra laws certain times"". Many ways make seem like NYC already piloting program validate 3rd party app use app allow private businesses say whether come in. 

I see problem that. already schools. could show card pic card wouldnt care. dont like government sponsored centralization ""access passport"". seems like BS could go down

Try accurate comparison explain wearing mask abit longer ruining life that's proprietary data J&amp;J.

however monday prior visit donated blood tested positive vaccine antibodies. Way people would rather get vaccine forge card One step deterrent. Right? Like privacy doubt bad things. course everyone wants work home... noone would want go back office. way easier, doesnt necessarily mean better company tho. pushing people wear masks Covid thing? Actually laboratory testing using live P.1 isolate showed AZ vaccine quite effective it, B1.135 much problematic study

As vaccines, bulk Canada’s rollout actually handled Pfizer vaccine somewhat lesser extent Moderna. AZ kinda like third player. ...Crisis Communication 101 reported wife received crisis communication training: ""sorry, answer question right now. Sorry, I'm available interview today, see scheduled press briefing tomorrow answer questions. Sorry, want accidentally mess data can't reply even caught lunch back office. Here's email address, here's phone number, I'm happy pass confirmed information confirmed.""


Just ... whenever blurting something may make bad situation worse, say nothing. need rude, answer... (easier said done) completely rejecting authoritarian scenarios involve tracking behavior

You already report vaccines go school. already thing. ""behavior tracking"", called ending disease. 

Do phone? tracked. can’t, company closed offices nationwide due pandemic won’t open anything back end year. working home, actually home working (I b2b call center). Lmao sounds like Glee Zombie special making lol. “The vaccine makes us break song spontaneously!” much EU solidarity Reread post try again. current government collapsing Sputnik vaccine right far know. I’m saying previous analogies weren’t accurate. compared apples oranges. 

I’m sure last year. kids pictures taken without mask. I’ve many outdoor activities last summer mask. 

The mandate go away eventually. I’d prefer go little farther needed, lifted come back. Maybe save life couple that. small inconvenience worth that?

Why ever stop wearing masks then? hang long failure find vaccines. come still wait SIX WHOLE MONTHS end rollout?

And also: january, asked put travel restrictions, waited waited waited? long? provinces suffer inability act fast. Pfizer, got second dose Moderna Friday well. plan much else weekend case. many side effects, tired next day, well SO. necessarily feel crappy also want leave couch/bed napped lot. go lunch next day promptly got tired went home nap. key hydrate lot get shot. hopefully fact regular people masks aware slow spread common diseases agree, referring smart PR-wise

It still make contradiction, primary point. Geez look comments too, lot pro Osterholm people seems  geez... even put job? find another job, sheesh would suck. Haha worked pandemic, wear mask least 8 hours day (caught covid anyway, that's besides point) got used it. Kinda crazy federal elected officials got vaccine back December regardless age Baker getting despite 64. general risk hanging friend who's dumbass.  think jobs lost printing passports /s situation could even come close current limitations basic rights freedoms would war form martial law. addition 2 people said, apparently oregon receiving average amount vaccines per capita. may federal facilities state feds sending less vaccines agencies institutions could said thing concert last century. Someone every crowd something another person crowd could potentially catch, disease would serious. risk was, always, there. start basing public health policy outlying cases, we're finished. point, might well close everything, seal doors windows start prepping steaks medium better. Cases flat week ago MI. One day isn’t trend course, hopefully it’s start better cool people work with. also ever want give single co worker mine ammo potentially get fired things say time. Darn, 1.4 million doses today, still 3 million daily vaccinations average though.

Probably due Easter though. talking private venues getting acces least full name medical data... data Brazilian P1 variant? wreaking havoc BC (Canada), UK variant ever did. wonder there's breakout Michigan, possibly undetected. friend covid make out, 5% chance. Yeah, young kids bad working food service handling everyone's silverware imo. vaccines undermined let rip society. Covid zero isn’t happening.

No one going continue distancing masking years years come end sight. flu SUCKS, honestly wear mask every place go rest life major pain ass. 

Can imagine wearing mask every indoor event? Four hour concerts? Basketball games? Museums? Work conferences? didn’t complain pandemic, complain pandemic over. think least surprising part news! news... Water Wet! know way work now, expect people try enforce two months basically everyone vaccinated. makes even less sense policy. gets back point either safe isn't. safe, need virtue signaling policy actually safe -- yes, always going risk spread amongst unvaccinated population. $100? even tootsie roll? That’s scary! guess certain spaces make mask-wearing permanent. Certain hospital wards, senior centers flu season, etc.

I also think mask wearing common certain spaces (like airplanes mass transit) indefinite period come.

I think mask wearing grocery store continue another month so. location go somehow open appointment, yeah. pretty much everywhere booked, gets full soon open appointments. like trying buy Coachella tickets Yeah, weird. I’m going university LA, expect person next fall even sent emails informing students plan that.  stand close radio towers otherwise hear static head.  Chile, deaths hospitalisations 50 years old aged men. Younger people *suddenly* worried virus. good bad emotions that. J&amp;J side effects joke me. Lasted little 2 days. drive case count zero need shut everything make happen

I know actually driving policy delusional behavior pandered way Jail time fraud! It’s perfect! multiple kids preK - K

I’m screwed anyway, get colds soon go back every fall. think california among last states end mask mandate, even though sky fallen states ended theirs. Arizona closest state ended theirs, [their numbers continue vaccination rates increase. 

Although part thinks they'll surprise everybody drop earlier news reporting. California done surprises already, like allowing indoor performances. expect news drop all. Correct. 2 forces, relaxations pretending fueling spread, force vaccinations reducing spread.

COVID spread up. force relaxations pretending greater force vaccinations. Probably won’t while. It’ll take time country get back “normal” know of. 

Happened post 9/11 US, it’ll happen post Covid world. 

New normal name game. mean look work place now. Working home acceptable seems working companies didn’t see beneficial. them, new normal welcomed lot workers refuse go back office amount work they’ve done office. might something daily government announcements ""You really pessimistic right now"". give ideas... Wait doggone minute - promised impending doom head CDC. I've never troubled wearing mask, stuck bed unable anything flu. uwu didn’t recommend masks 2019 either, mask wearing still right thing do. Don’t follower, leader. right thing. PEOPLE... 1 dose Vaccine week mean immune, gave us knows many else selfish

Been saying people ""bUt WaNT Go oUT"". suddenly immune got one vaccine dodos. consider pool fully open required wear shirt. consider movie theater fully open required blindfold.

Well, asked restaurant requiring shirt shoes, movie theater showing R movie requiring ID's. 

Instead answering that, changed things. answer restaurant ""fully open"" clothing requirements public health reasons, instead ignoring question? 'I got mine, fuck everybody else's seems trend here, it. Gets vaccine, follows mandates, home year, 'its much liberty I'm gonna poopoo whole idea'. Like, dude, ready bus heading next stop...just hop ride done it. Damn people fucking stupid assholes. I'd rather catch flu every year meant could work, travel, shop unmasked. bet $20 charity winner's choice hit 200k every single day week starting today Sunday. doesn’t. Mask mandates eventually lifted honestly last thing lifted. cost nothing upwards 60-70 percent states residents vaccinated, mandate really stay. MLB implemented mandatory vaccine negative test entry. Let’s hope sports leagues follow suit, well concert venues large indoor gatherings! Don’t come you’re anti vaxer. blocked. Arsenal supporters club New York. Believe meet watch games also arrange trips London (in normal “mass debilitation event” new one. looks like that’s new boogie man  Bolsonaro worst enemy. really highlights dangers populism. Especially pretty much people wanted vaccine received Hell yeah I’ll take one cold per year flu every years wearing mask ever again.  US also reaching 1/3 vaccinated tomorrow. thats cdc recommends literally washing hands using hand sanitizer frequently prevents colds. don’t really need mask cold. There's whole article behind headline btw, bullshit all. us (EU, UK, America) putting eggs one basket depending vaccines get us mutations varients become even partially vaccine-resistant real concern. vaccines undermined way, we're back square one.

Countries managed well taken serious suppression route casually rolling vaccines part overall strategy, they're one tool arsenal. subbreddit? easier fight something exist claim victory actual work governance fixing real problems. for? Power money comes less visible things easily, without mob noticing. well 80 percent protection even getting shot. 14 day window conservative- 90 percent 7 days post second dose. Gotcha. I'm sure people would comply though. hard restrictions seem going well Europe, currently, even close numbers proposing. I'm sure asked million times, healthy 30 year old male eligible schedule vaccine. option go areas covid clinic I'll get either Moderna Pfizier go local pharmacy get J&amp;J. recommendations option take option would take? Don’t know tell man. one allowed delivery virus pushed vaccinated. Sounds like don’t want ever seen hospital? North Korea? big concern would then, like next couple weeks. despite usual pessimism agree- time case rise people make immune, making harder harder. wants perpetual state fear even though make sense, all. He's despot.  Abbott bans **government-mandated** 'vaccine passports' Texas

This ban explicitly publicly-funded entities. right businesses, entities require vaccine passport — there’s order mostly covers Texas government agencies, also states “any public private entity receiving receive public funds” also cannot require passport. order states includes grants, contracts, loans forms taxpayer money going entity. (Reuters) - World Health Organization back requiring vaccination passports travel due uncertainty whether inoculation prevents transmission virus, well equity concerns, spokeswoman said saying stage would like see vaccination passport requirement entry exit certain stage vaccine prevents transmission,” spokeswoman Margaret Harris questions, apart question discrimination people able vaccine one reason another,” told U.N. news expects review China’s COVID-19 vaccines Sinopharm Sinovac possible emergency use listing around end April, Harris coming quickly hoped need data,” said, declining provide information, citing confidentiality.

They still don’t agree vaccines prevent transmission.

I thought would concerned equity that’s whole reason existence. hotspot

You think US going hotspot 70% population vaccine? so, US bigger problems tourists anyway lol recall election estimated take place november unless new pandemic hits, newsom probably gonna sail easy victory day manager — who talk every single day feel like know pretty well point — made joke height, realized absolutely idea tall lol Good. Rescind/abolish lockdowns mask mandates entirely. states need follow suit. needs stop posted. Newsom saying mask mandate stay even full reopening. okay normal. aware campaigns put pressure society right thing incredibly normal?

This wouldn’t different “click ticket” schools ensuring everyone vaccinated coming school. danger others about. far aware evidence severe outcomes vaccinated infected. Though again, advisable know sure. better I'm NYC, plan all. nice see plan, always move things like Biden carry oxygen supply. study watched people six months, vaccine still working.

We've got every reason think it'll work whole lot longer, study say ""at least six months"" they've watching people six months far. It’s conservative virtue signaling, nothing more. June 15th we’re expected 70% US population vaccinated. I’d say surge would impossible then. literally friend say getting time good least 3 months see point risking getting shot lasted long. 
As long risk surge Business isnt gonna take signs required till CDC says reached 70% vaccinated. It’s enforced people kinda chug alone. 

This proven FL TX mask mandate business still “require” time clear given. show statistics vaccine studies, probs infinitely convincible average OANN/fox news watcher. They're likely bring lot shit country, ever demand federal vaccine passport diseases? calm lol whole ""this go forever people demand end"" line bs cover argument people use justify selfish behavior. somehow deluded think acting like entitled brat somehow what's going save society. Facebook, lack critical thinking. Side effects Pfizer much better blood clot, simply comparison discomfort death. jump vaccine passports coming from? government giving business information. end day still decision give information out. also business' right refuse serve decide make choice. decisions, rights exercised here. Move attacking you, belittling you, insulting you.

He literally told lived cave last year. Honestly, really take offense that, comment huge issue, many people taking pandemic seriously. However take trying dismiss comment coming elitists prove point. never shipments recorded sunday monday, tuesday first day. won't. They'll still mask mandate. They've called ""common sense"" keep masks indefinitely. That's reopening. That's normal. Newsom decided California residents get normal lives anymore subreddit cheer. Reclaiming name Grandpa Joe, away awful deadbeat Grandpa Joe forced daughter toil got chance go chocolate factory. wondered something similar myself. Could NPI, suppress wild-type coronavirus, giving variants unobstructed highway speed establish dominance?"
