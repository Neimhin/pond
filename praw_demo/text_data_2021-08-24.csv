So, get bitten teeny tiny bat toe sleep never even realized it, 5 months later virus traveled nervous system brain, headache thought could due dehydration consequences late night netflix binge could actually first sign impending death. key word we're going get 1 million+ going dead united states. Taiwan's gotta get vaccines many people possible next outbreak. Yes, *so* predictable. There’s huge overlap unvaccinated hostile mask mandates, course unvaccinated would take opportunity blend maskless vaccinated. CDC see this? expected people follow common sense logical? Expecting illogical could do... 40 times long? AIDS 120 years old? us actually listen leading scientists world read statistics publish.

They tell us fatality rate age 12 kids one million. 

They also tell us risk myocarditis caused vaccines higher age vaccinated people gets lower, e.g. highest risk myocarditis resulting vaccination teenage boys. 

I know argument doctor OP referring would wait vaccination 12-16 year old kids... suspect willingness roll dice one million odds would factor. get jab move life.

If vaccine, thing preventing moving life government. one even pronounce ""Arkansans""? ADE Antibody Dependent Enhancement effect antibodies work making easier virus enter cells. Normally, antibodies attach exterior bits virus (such spike protein SARS-CoV-2) prevent virus binding cell receptors use enter cell. However, cases shape antibody instead preventing it, virus+antibody combination easier time entering cell.

The well known example ADE Dengue virus. Dengue actually family 5 related, different viruses. Infection one causes body produce antibodies effective particular member family, also bind somewhat Dengue viruses. However, binding good enough neutralize Dengue viruses subsequent infection different Dengue virus result severe disease virus easier time spreading inside body thanks antibodies.

ADE shown vaccine trials past. concern ADE SARS lab environment. going vaccine development SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), concerns vaccines might cause ADE. However, billions shots already arms quite large number vaccinated people exposed COVID-19 since getting shots, conclusion clear: Vaccines perfect breakthrough infections happen, generally less severe infections unvaccinated evidence ADE seen.  literally citing studies (the limitations actually hilarious fact cited goes show much rely press releases) referring vaccine somehow ""better"" targeting spikes... somehow ""disproves"" importance natural immunity possibly better vaccination? Anyone brain would expect something built target spikes similar/better at... targeting spikes. 
 
This another example people misreading misinterpreting press releases they're unable read headlines, classic example ""science press release"" here. Adodie noted, even know study specifically saying - study refers pretty much eliciting immune response (natural immunity) vs twice (natural immunity + vaccine). Again, anyone brain would expect that. 
 
There's immunity antibodies - Cells B Cells exist. Natural immunity may better responses, therefore probably making better dealing variants (somatic hypermutation), STILL know long immunity strong immune response COVID actually lasts robust is. specific ways natural vs vaccinated immunity better other, there's money made research never get much research showing anything articles note limited/specific examples vaccine better (as showed). 
 
Here sources (low n, had) shits gigs anyway show importance natural immunity. read/understand anyway based previous comments:    
 
Natural immunity's ability deal variants:  
 
Annnd nice article showing research needs done vaccine memory cell responses provide solid answers, notes robustness natural infection:  
 
The linked study article (and another 2) case actually capable reading past press release headlines:

We'd almost back square one, issuing emergency use,

why would case since it'd still covid different enough spike proteins need make new vaccine? flu vaccine act way? seek EU time new flu vaccine every year, would need new covid vaccine?

genuine questions here. time vaccine authorized every kid already infected. Nursing home breakthrough cases usually going serious. bologna buffet. mandate requirement? confused word. law mandate? Anyone believes anything batshit looney says good luck lol Stupid thing coughing spitting food already illegal pandemic :P Says man greatest incentive world vaccine resistant variant transmissible virus change whether vaccinated not. case virus aerosol enclosed space someone get it. unavoidable. Things like masks used reduce viral load, also transmitted respiratory droplets, prevent getting it. Reducing viral load means likely get sick sick quite long. 

Vaccination, like natural immunity, gives body blueprint recognize. already knows protein sequence white blood cells information without exchange means get sick likely get faster. 

None changes easily virus transmitted, immunity changes length time takes body clear infection. 100 miles west. mask mandates, vaccine mandates, seeing goes... longer takes, likely virus mutate evade vaccination. keeping going ability potentially rob rest us small fragments safety finally managed obtain. frustrating. I'm medical field lot people field (speaking mostly myself, pretend speak all) - know much longer take this. mention many lost. lose many medical professionals healthcare systems fall apart completely. already experiencing shortages real issues there.

Thank saying this, every time hear voice reason feel drop strength return fight another day. think they're asking clinical trials need repeated, questioning whether vaccine actually end safe. Yeah viruses ""die out"" becoming mega infectious barely anything you. goal replicate. made call data available.

Citation needed. needed good guy virus perhaps lead insurrection! Let's work up! We're DONE, whatever means. Nope. companies succeed, they’ll make fortune. vaccine 3/4 world want, plus boosters every often.

I hope succeed. upvoted ya   what's gonna happen current boosters 6-8 months happening USA/Israel? 

Isn't gonna get confusing public? Like 3 shots, need Delta specific? keep hearing current vaccines actually good against, wanes time/over delta take medicine intended large animals,"" Gov. Hutchinson said reference online misinformation implying certain livestock drugs help prevent COVID symptoms. Water = wet R = (45.6 × 95)/(54.4 × 5) = 16

The unvaccinated 16 times likely die Alabama admitted hospital. anyone 12 years older COVID typically early stages disease asymptomatic mild symptoms. Rule thumb apparently within 10 days symptom onset importantly, sick need hospitalized. guess get sick, antibodies work well anymore often go traditional treatments and/or ventilator.

So people like Trump recently Texas Governor Abbot got monoclonal antibodies mildly symptomatic even asymptomatic.

We seem decent supply it, least places fire COVID. Anecdotally treating physician seems good amount discretion prescribe treatment. day spoke ED physician hospital young woman looked covid pneumonia CT, PCR test negative, ED doc said she'll likely test positive 24 hours would go ahead offer regeneron. diagnosed COVID patient clinical symptoms CT scan, even tested positive, able prescribe treatment based that.

The difference staggering. People spend money vacation home.

Also lot tourist-centric attractions accommodation drop prices match kiwi spending power, people going 'oooh bargain ski holiday time'. Throw lower transport costs within NZ well means people spending lot freely might otherwise taking excuse travel around country bit, spend holiday money place.

Kiwis culture big overseas trips (because mission get anywhere). gone away, redirected internally. Possible r/HermanCainAward nominee? literally patients sleeping cots last year. Also, beds hospital speak staff/supplies on, plus physical space patients. iCU bed isnt equal something med surg bed. weren’t vaccinated (not medical reasons) go back line. homeschool, try reaching local/state/regional homeschool organization. Homeschooling difficult - loads resources available. make ""personalized"" ""out box"" want, terms curriculum, homeschool organization help determine what's best &amp; family.

Homeschool organizations often help coordinate mandatory state testing requirements - responsible homeschool families do. tests get sent government showing ""on track"" child's education is. I'm guessing mandatory states, us Minnesota.

I homeschooled life, difficult times experienced it, also lent many opportunities public school friends able experience (and vice versa). There's pros cons - biggest benefit child's education. allows flourish areas they're talented in, provides 1:1 ""tutoring"" opportunities areas struggle with. started college 15, math &amp; science nerd still trouble spelling ""conscious"".

People often worry children's social abilities/mental health homeschooling - I'm sure different pandemic - really, figure together. lots things homeschooled kids meet/interact children homeschooled. Honestly, last list worries :) People required vaccine lose jobs/privileges. fair bit Tall Poppy syndrome rest world eh?

Getting assed kicked bbq? intention all, say unfortunately deeply rooted issue repeated multiple times history. See ""Anti-Mask League"" 1918/19 flu. even in-person maskless gatherings ended superspreading events.

I 100% agree previous administration deserves vast majority blame, actual leadership needed start. It’s unpaid. article:

“District administrators offered let take nine weeks unpaid leave re-evaluate status then.”

But don’t worry, she’s already got GoFundMe page set - joke. virus mutates anymore, people going start saying vaccine that's making mutate.

My antivaxxer family members already saying delta exists cause vaccine smdh 100% interpreted headline. Like court defense: “I plead guilty, believe virus sentenced, me!”  There’s thing “god given rights”. nature, “god given right” would something could taken away. So… clearly doesn’t exist. think numbers incorrect. think mixed daily number total numbers. 


Let’s see:

1, 7, 11, 11, 21, 21, 35, 41, 62

Those numbers daily new cases Auckland Outbreak. 

We currently 210 *total active cases* community. 

If exponential growth, day would positive cases day before. would climbing exponents, seeing new cases. 

Note today 15 case jump. 

It’s also important note vast majority cases today close contacts people already identified cases places interest. unknown cases popping up. able easily track determine got virus. 

So… no. It’s exponential it’s jumping magnitudes numbers. 

If exponential, would well

Also, saying Secretary General health basic math bit silly. team behind knows stuff proved planet know talking about. I’d suggest, Respectfully, remind best informed people planet handled pandemic better *just anyone else*

So Ashley Bloomfield says seeing exponential growth, trust him. 

Cheers. Brrr, cold take?  positivity rate counted number *tests* given. Highlighted since did, dipset. say that? No. know plenty elderly folk family fully vaccinated, living normal lives.

CECC much asked everyone stay home unless work, closed schools, limited gatherings five, banned indoor dining closed many non essentials there’s nowhere hang. could go there’s nowhere go supermarket. 

The contact tracing/isolation (still is) quite aggressive. far lower rate unvaccinated people though that's important. almost everyone vaccinated, virus would circulate little would able return normal, minus nonessential physical contact, never good idea anyway. said article also mentions scientists believe SARS-COV-2 continues mutate eventually lose ability infect people.

Not quite said. Angela Rasmussen, virologist University Saskatchewan Canada, told Telegraph possibility vaccine-resistant strain would require many mutations spike protein virus 'work' anymore,"" Rasmussen said.

She's saying SARS-CoV-2 eventually lose ability infect people - - saying order mutation bypass vaccine, would need mutate point longer capable infecting anyone.

So new, vaccine-proof mutation would die inside host, dominant variant would continue dominant variant.

It's entirely possible many vaccine-evading mutations already occurred, died host able replicate inside cells. also important know anything covered China's side. evidence coronavirus evolve evade T-cell B-cell immunity.

It likely already has, offshoot successful. Well, obvs. evolution work, significant part population vaccinated places, evolutionary pressure huge. 

We already see Delta degree. Yes, vaccine still ""works"" makes difference, longer prevent infection transmission. think next evolution something else.

The point nobly waiting need it, waiting right too. guess what, say sweet vaccines despite others needing do.   first graph shows cases logarithmic scale, yet trying compare graph exponential function standard scale. shows major lack knowledge, [exponential growth looks like linear increase logarithmic 7, 11, 11, 21, 21, 35, 41, 62

4 days increase, roughly corresponds serial interval delta is: +200%, +91%, +218%, +273%, 195%; clear indication exponential growth. Additionally increase far roughly exponential proven first graph - showing roughly linear increase logarithmic scale. 

Also cases infected lock-down started shortly lockdown measures force, thus measures could significantly decreased reproductive number. lockdown measures show numbers (in days) may longer exponential growth, whether case still unknown.  hide data government? leaky

What even mean. honest, lockdowns compared countries even harsh. help everyone (well mostly) part masking following guidelines.  may true govt decided delay vaccination suggest reasons suggest. time better understand decision right one. personally think bit botch up, hindsight always easy.

In case, delay cost us couple weeks lockdown, apparently print money days... would nice print money fix existing problems rather pay another level 4 lockdown may avoided vaccinated earlier.

We're literally following exact supply schedule contracted Pfizer January February, difference government switched plans slow, measured rollout 2 jabs 3 weeks age groups everyone getting firsts jab ASAP second month two. Hilarious comments. relevant point because...? Ah, obvious! Thank answer! we’ve lived Covid free vast majority past two years. many countries say same. 

Sorry can’t understand that. Yeah might help us stop deadly disease know could new way. turning eyes Iceland, Malta, Iberian peninsula, Arabian Peninsula South America

All medical treatment potential ti harmful.

What's interesting fund paid even vaccine actually cause harm! could total coincidence (which happens often, vaccines given ages issues also occur chance). claim vaccine injury without proof vaccine caused still get paid. That's fun paid much. example, vaccines cause autism, yet people paid anyway. know right? headline really something. reading article seems we're missing first part story debate whether Adult entertainment considered essential level 4 lockdown. definitely didn't.

Heard Interesting note many unvaccinated dummies longer care ""only authorized emergency usage"" part need treatment....   Hopefully ends regional issue. area 91.5% eligible vaccinated. I'm also kept us going office least 3 days week entire pandemic case someone came in. came back full time last summer around november forced close Aprilish forced us back 3 days week full time july 6th. give hope find place permanent WFH field. Look [a log may understand they're this.

Remember, vax rate would still make even deep red US state blush. Work progress, due still limited supply. lockdowns restrictive measures sustainable.

We never really US anywhere couple months. behavior never matched supposed restriction. Basically point we've said, ""everyone own"". Please don’t project hopelessness onto kids. pandemics end. really, really hard little ones told never end could completely fuck mental health. Good enough American Academy Pediatrics, good enough me. saw someone else posted recommendation. like ""If leave now, get popcorn."" turns ""okay leave now, still catch previews least,"" becomes ""if leave now, we'll miss first part movie."" vaccines works target variants, even going coronaviruses. Depends definition ""collapse."" nursing subreddit, saw definition collapse describes exact situation regional collapse.

Collapse defined as, COVID crowding medical treatment. Cancer treatments delayed, elective surgeries postponed, super-urgent care (strokes, heart attacks) forced wait hours (which pretty much bakes crappy outcome). 

If ""collapse"" means ""totally non-functional, videogame-style empty hospitals"" we're *that* point yet. previously said we'd control vaccine 65% effective. much better, we're still not. one ever thought vaccines would give 100% protection. Pfizer &amp; Moderna clear “95-98%” thing. material risk catching covid, tell, let alone force, people get vaccine. They'd confused headline well, article specifically mentions end September likely October.

But far full approval, 12-15 isn’t fully approved yet either. mean need percent get herd immunity.

""While full FDA approval likely several months away, Pfizer's vaccine could cleared emergency use earlier, possibly October, submission trial data."" F evidence prove risk serious outcomes children ""still fairly high""? vaccination rates increase, selective pressure variants evade immunity. 

Excellent point. Thanks informative response.  Get vaccinated lose driver's license. Simple effective.

A cursory glance comments surrounding topic show many people concerned forcibly making people destitute refusing authoritative overreach returning society semblance normality. concerns far virus taking seriouslly early January 2020, well made rounds mainstream media. Moderation key healthy society people clamouring civil rights sacrificed illusion security. WA outbreak try spread here, fleeting transfer pub everything. first two weeks July. Zero restrictions since, border, thanks zero covid.

By zero, mean there's literal music festivals taking bookings right now. last line tattooed me! stopped doing?

I ask serious, good faith, non-rhetorical question.

I impression LA totally open, wear mask indoors show proof vaccination certain things. correct? There's prison ramen cookbook. hospital currently 15% vaccinated patients relatively high vaccinated area. know spewing absolute bullshit statistics. you’re saying there’s hope?  seeing number? Nothing like smell desert rain though curious, software engineer thing computer programmer?  Well that’s mean. innocent people get hurt needlessly? hate them? Yea cause super dumb send school without vaccines. calculating wrong, though.

You need include living people calculation.

So US, 140 million cases 600k deaths, mortality rate is:

(600k - 600k)/(140 million - 600k) = 0

See that? subtracted dead people.

So survival rate 100%, say 99.9% packs bigger punch.

/s somehow clear. Many developed countries deaths day NZ total, unvaxxed, planning administer boosters. Boosters necessarily available right now.

Then obviously there's rest world, could donate share. European countries already it, Pfizer (so outside covaxin scheme AZ).

You're want doses. obvious fair enough, literally nothing ""not needing it"". Same, like 'How misspell cougar?'

Oh.... vaccine effective reducing infections significantly. That's immunity. Immunity mean 100% reduction possibility infection, vaccine history ever effective.

 


Please, stop ""correcting"" people correct. Clearly everyone must gotten least twice! /s ?

I'm anti mask. latest data J&amp;J suggests become 2-shot, eight months shots. ;-) mean like Israel good control pandemic?   don’t hospitals turn away anti-vax patients give goodie bag full bleach filled syringes horse dewormer bill $100,000 “treatment” simpletons claim works? Seems like great way make money improve hospital capacity. 100% agree. Prayers causing mess. Teaching bronze age magical thinking scientific method critical thinking core people cant make good decisions. Prayer wishing so. So,we fucked. However, conveniently skip fact pretty much whole world STILL needs do.

That's incorrect, US EU vaccinated vulnerable (who chose accept it). highlight country afford Pfizer large outbreaks, I'm ears. dead  Eh, point don’t bother. Thin herd little idiots, we’d better long run it.   rant? Seemed fairly tame considering situation.

And accurate.   Yeah, that's yuge fucking dropped alright mean, yes, that's true. would accurate say *mostly* themselves, well killing immunocompromised, already poor health, people need urgent medical treatment unexpectedly, cancer patients, children certain ages certain states, unlucky. 

It's wide spray damage, though *largest* group suffering it, also creating huge amount human shrapnel tearing many people. Anxious. good feeling. Hoping best important information would be, many children need intensive care, get long covid long lasting problems. 
Yes, covid serious disease. need think ahead
Which state want achieve. understanding possibility live it. got vaccinations, hopefully prevents enough serious outcomes... record, basically correct, need divide number calculate equation efficacy spread disease, well.

So vaccines/natural infections 90% effective, 85% would actually need correspond 85%/90%= 94.5% population needing vaccinated infected. Gots ensure 300 million Americans get tendies. *Kia Ora intensifies* Personally I'm celebrating... like looking awe people ridiculously stupid. fucking take animal medication instead vaccine, hard watch So… no.

So, one covered farmed mink, sounds like getting rid farmed mink (or vaccinating them) could keep check.  Oh please.    State Senator F comes global warming. Like, solvable, won't. COVID broke faith humanity. man never right 😂 Eventually, protection infection turn white noise. Protection symptomatic infection vaccine’s effectiveness measured, it’s always measured. There’s growing evidence vaccinated individuals infected much less infective unvaxxed individuals( surprise hardly immunologists). Asymptomatic vaxxed individuals likely hard time spreading virus. way find list vaccines approved WHO? cannot get vaccines like Moderna Pfizer country. might stuck Sinopharm, Covishield Sputnik. sounds incredibly frustrating. douchbag parents New England too, enough stop mask requirements.

OP missed point, multiple times.  think want part article. Effectively pregnant women times likely need serious medical intervention non-pregnant women, quite significant. pregnant women still generally young women baseline risk pretty low getting pregnant several times small number still (reasonably) small number. nonpregnant women, pregnant women frequently admitted ICU (10.5 versus 3.9 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 3.0; 95% CI = 2.6–3.4), received invasive ventilation (2.9 versus 1.1 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 2.9; 95% CI = 2.2–3.8) received ECMO (0.7 versus 0.3 per 1,000 cases; aRR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.5–4.0). Thirty-four deaths (1.5 per 1,000 cases) reported among 23,434 symptomatic pregnant women, 447 (1.2 per 1,000 cases) reported among 386,028 nonpregnant women, reflecting 70% increased risk death associated pregnancy (aRR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2–2.4). Irrespective pregnancy status, ICU admissions, receipt invasive ventilation, death occurred often among women aged 35–44 years among aged 15–24 years (Table 2). Whereas non-Hispanic Black African American (Black) women made 14.1% women included analysis, represented 176 (36.6%) deaths overall, including nine 34 (26.5%) deaths among pregnant women 167 447 (37.4%) deaths among nonpregnant women. 
Increased risk ICU admission among pregnant women observed strata particularly notable among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) women (aRR = 6.6; 95% CI = 4.0–11.0) non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women (aRR = 3.7; 95% CI = 1.3–10.1). Risk receiving invasive ventilation among pregnant women aged 15–24 years 3.0 times nonpregnant women (95% CI = 1.6–5.7), among pregnant women aged 35–44 years 3.6 times nonpregnant women (95% CI = 2.4–5.4). addition, among Hispanic women, pregnancy associated 2.4 times risk death (95% CI = 1.3-4.3) (Table 2). influx patients took horse dewormer. someone drunk driving everyday, wouldn’t happy died hurt someone else? easily contribute, internet way everyone's mind. centrally organised planned campaign, like Qidiots plan way Iqada did. surprised nations decided add disinformation organised way, though. would people upvote incorrect information?

Fauci CDC seem line version, worth.

I think really true.

They (correctly) argue getting vaccinated infected gives much better protection infected. Given basically downsides getting shot, everyone get vaccinated. 

That different argument one natural immunity fades quickly somehow weaker vaccine induced immunity. Pediatricians kinda definition know lot healthcare kids. Kids tiny adults bodies react differently medications dosages adults. 

We want kids vaccinated. toddler, work large ER new wave constantly around COVID. REALLY want kid vaccinated. also really want good evidence dose first 1) best chance develop immunity 2) least likelihood side effects.

It's beyond worthless. Politics capatalism Maybe need vaccinate people Delta Air Lines charge employees company health plan $200 month fail get vaccinated COVID-19, policy airline’s top executive says necessary average hospital stay virus costs airline $40,000

CEO Ed Bastian said employees hospitalized virus recent weeks fully vaccinated.
The airline said Wednesday also stop extending pay protection unvaccinated workers contract COVID-19 Sept. 30, require unvaccinated workers tested weekly beginning Sept. 12, although Delta cover cost. wear masks indoor company settings.

Delta stopped short matching United Airlines, require employees vaccinated starting Sept. 27 face termination. However, $200 monthly surcharge, starts November, may effect.

“This surcharge necessary address financial risk decision vaccinate creating company,” Bastian said memo employees.

Bastian said 75% Delta employees vaccinated, 72% mid-July. said aggressiveness leading strain virus “means need get many people vaccinated, close 100% possible.”

The Delta CEO referred COVID-19 mutation originated India medical name, B.1.617.2, rather common term, delta variant.

New reported cases COVID-19 U.S. top 150,000 day, highest level since late January, although rate increase slowed. Southwest, Spirit Frontier blamed virus slowdown customers booking flights, U.S. air travel remains 20% pre-pandemic 2019.

Delta United already require new hires vaccinated. major U.S. airlines, including American Southwest, say encouraging employees get vaccinated required it.

Delta’s requirement weekly testing unvaccinated employees start Sept. 12, requirement unvaccinated wear masks indoors takes effect immediately.

A growing number companies including Chevron Corp. drugstore chain CVS announced require workers get vaccinated week’s decision Food Drug Administration give full approval instead emergency-use permission Pfizer vaccine.

The FDA’s move could boost U.S. vaccination rate, fell 3.4 million shots day April 500,000 day July. since climbed 850,000 day concern grows rising number new infections caused delta variant.

If can’t even go run myself, outside, without mask isn’t life worth living rn  Testing antibodies requires blood draw. quadruple it? aren’t mandating, there’s ways get there.  already implied scared contracting covid vaccinated individual.

I fear covid months now. Excellent. needed. People increase risk *to others* need pay more. temper bit, cases long enough ago longer sterilizing antibodies cells system. memory B cells around make new antibodies quickly, still get sick spread others. 

If guess, number folks *active* natural immunity probably 20-30M range. wondering much fear related whether live area prone lockdowns.

What noticed travel non lockdown states fear walking around without masks lockdowns months serious infections deaths remain scant.

Yet travel lockdown prone areas people terrified vaccine conscious explanation fathom think verge black plague lockdowns mask wearing.

In words appears people stop overly concerned see normalcy action.

I wonder many overly concerned commenters live areas without lockdowns while?
Anyone care say state country? like well wears mask. would expect nothing less  I’m talking story valid news. Reddit comments, it’s sub rules happy someone died wish someone would die. always report comments aren’t civil.

I feel stories circulate, better informed people think somehow invincible become.

I fully expect see similar press releases countries within 30-60 days. get vaccinated? expect accepted hospital get sick. 30-60 days growing number hospital ER's ICU's swamped closed new admissions. means triage. Vaccinated patients higher chance survival. Triage 101.

It police offers patrolling streets ticketing anyone home... jailing people... welding doors shut (like China). would also require government organizations partner hotels rideshare companies (like Taiwan) soon land, required picked company driven designated hotel police officer would call daily 14 days quarantine.

Vaccination brainer. think need control groups point wants live world boring? much ""gift tax""?

I know get $xxxx ""tax free"" seems like giving heirs million bucks week die - even pay income tax - would preferable losing 3 week ICU stay.  Fortunately, acts God factor property insurance--and they're often covered.   much people refused protect families endanger COVID (let's stop calling choice take vaccine) simply dropped dead home impact society I'd letting choose hill die decision means many others suffer. Many people surgery need care ICU bed surgeries simply cannot happen beds occupied. 

If end waiting days easily lead complications issues also paid for. unable see family idiots read something FB shit.  Ah yes seems expanded instead full approval. Either way great great news! Clinical studies since Nov 2020 show 85% reduction death hospitalizations. Endangering who?

2) Due Delta’s higher R0, updated 80%-90% That’s get count done least year. gonna raise obese people though? course don’t care employees. But, like lot big companies self-funded insurance, hundreds thousands employees getting Covid hospital stays going hit bottom line. 

From insurance perspective, ending vent hospital Covid basically elective procedure.  Yea true, illness less severe honestly curious cross border travel border opens, sort ground rules place. Problem everyone wasting time mask arguments anything else (like FDA approving vaccine 12s). lets forget 12s get vaccinated. wasting time masks arguments focusing getting many students vaccinated eligible. 

I know unmasked schools getting headlines surges...but masked schools also experiencing huge surges. believe simple cloth mask effective 8 hours close contact Delta. mention lunch/outside activities/sports etc... they're fucking dumb.

Nobody happy insurance sit make understand much they're paying little coverage.

Obvious negligible edge case exceptions aside. Hospital Administrator here... ""spitball"" month ICU costs. Dont shoot messenger here, depending age things could looking anywhere 500k 1.5 million.  way many variables get far cost. telling know.

However.. patient UNINSURED ( means even covered Medicare Medicaid ) program patient charged gov pay small portion bill eat rest.

This goes across board, whether uninsured fully insured, total billed amount NEVER hospital actually gets paid. EVER. know infected everyone mean anything... Right??? mental gymnastics astounding. Well good, getting focused studying origins next pandemic, might even pandemic smart it? Smart!  Brilliant!!!!!!!! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Best decision ever made. vid Something keep mind - billed rates hospital care entirely fictitious arbitrary. *actual cost hospital * 24 hours ICU around $10-20k. submitted insurance, charges look astronomical, often around $100k+, adjusted insurance agreements much lower. patient uninsured, amount charged lower, still arbitrary, there's insurance deal adjustment applied.

Studies estimate *costs medical providers* based *amount billed patients* fundamentally flawed. smoke cigarettes, self-employed, pay higher health insurance premiums. risk = cost. That's discrimination. likely require insurance payouts care remain employees. Respectfully, please don’t make sweeping presumptions immunocompromised immunosuppressed folks. 

I’m both, cold flu never life-threatening like covid. never wore mask pandemic. Millions people like would probably say exact thing. 

The fact remains, covid isn’t flu.

Pointing us doesn’t help argument, fwiw. 

Thank understanding know risk tolerance react accordingly. Essentially telling *us* “do anyway” doesn’t relieve anyone else responsibility.  Holy shit cheap plan.

My premiums $500 month $4000 deductible. Trump Biden individual states, messaging unity Covid awful. believe ""misinformation"" lack clear messages caused past spike Delta.

If get vaccine give sugary donuts make risk diabetes &amp; death COVID-19!

OR suppose could skip vaccine &amp; donuts break even?

Gotta keep public messaging ANYTHING diet &amp; exercise!  overall impression mixed.

**On pessimistic side:** 

He seemed pretty convinced new strains inevitable, we're going see sars viruses jump species increasing frequency.

On new strains, mentioned B1261 (from Columbia) one shown deadly, represents 9% cases Florida... though say much deadly, so, either know, anywhere near twice deadly.

The extra jumping fleshed out; assume based ever growing populations ever growing invasion previously untouched habitats.

He spoke increased reactogenicity booster shots; bode well people's continued vaccination uptake. Seemed mRNA vaccines generally less likely cause uncomfortable reactions J&amp;J (or adenovirus-based vaccines), following J&amp;J one mRNA boosters caused vigorous immune reactions (and thus symptoms) mRNA boosters atop previous mRNA vaccinations.

Likewise, seemed suggest reactions new strains likely worse whether someone convalescent immunity ('natural immunity') immunity vaccines. definitely likely scare folk might've fence vaccinations (even though says thing happens 'naturally...' 'natural' immunity less effective overall).

A mixed-bag sharing vaccinations kids aged 5-11 6 months off; due FDA requiring longer follow-up window required adults. great we're extra careful kids, means we're gonna feel full brunt in-person schooling's effect overall spread till well next semester.

Overall, seemed pretty sure things gonna get worse get better.

&amp;#x200B;

**On optimistic side:**

He made clear vaccines great job reducing infection, hospitalization, death rates, across variants; mutation rates slowed vaccinated populations.

New vaccines works also seemed really promising; targeted specific strains, looking train immune systems S-Protein, specifically meant effective known sars viruses. latter two seem like major leaps forward could significantly turn tide now, provide amazing help dealing sars viruses going forward.

Novavax sounds like promising, new vax already trials seems lowest reactogenicity vaccines date... could big help uptake rates fence.

Also, spoke many vaccine delivery systems horizon; focusing largely ease transport (good helping rest world get vaxxed), everything vaccine pills inhalants (which could help folk cool needles decide get vaxxed). seem like really big deals me; especially transportability.

He spoke well Native American communities vaccination programs (eg. Navajo nation better vaxxed rest country large).

One major thing far less likely end ER ICU using vital resources contracting COVID vaccinated. Currently, hospitals city (and cities) capacity ICUs unvaccinated COVID patients. get bad car crash today getting kind care expect emergency situation. choosing vaccinate cause larger problems society whole. 

Not mention, people getting sick COVID costing insurance companies money, higher rates go up. even without universal healthcare, still paying peoples' medical care due ""risk sharing"".

Conclusion: probably trust Worldometer data two weeks ago. Supreme Court disagrees. Jacobson v. Mass, decided, ""It within police power State enact compulsory vaccination law"".  appointment CVS I'm 4 months (thought 5 first dose).

Anyway, right booked like ""you're dumb.""

Now I'm thinking delaying two weeks time data comes out. How’s third shot Regeneron working? Push old people way recently? see point, unfortunately can't know yet (just know early stages viruses). Everyone wants vaccine able get free 6 months now. want vaccine already it, that's fault.

There vaccine shortage. There's enough go around. try let know works you. mention one comply anyway. coworker's biggest reason getting it. bad still get it. Wonder also pro private business rights. Seems like everyone wants cake eat too.  Initially, back mid 2020, reports saying 85-90% population fully vaxxed order reach herd immunity. number surprisingly dropped 15-20%, became clear initial numbers would even close met. Canada is, right around 65% fully vaxxed 73% partially vaxxed. 10% numbers, eligible population, means 10% belong kids 12. way we're going get anywhere near 85-90% kids vaxxed. Even then, bit stretch. wonder many conversations happening around rebrand Delta right now. I’ve seen all! Good lord. exactly trying get across?” one Facebook user commented photos posted school board meeting.

Come people really dumb? significant dust experimental Anthrax vaccine Iraq timeline. people ill effects probably want repeat boondoogle. certain news outlet telling people otherwise unfortunately. portion population actually thinks 7 figure healthcare bills somehow better everyone getting equal care taxdollars “Off cuff shooting hip”… mean like do, post links articles you’ve never read argue opposite want claim? Probably not. healthcare system joke is, throw pandemic top it’s 100 times worse. Well let’s see cities defy entrench governor paper tiger. That’s one! long doctor let eat, they'll live. prisoners least parasite free. Still low gesundheit watched morning matter fact. I’ve watched year. first video feel jumped gun said things shouldn’t saying.

Just saying. Highly disagree take one. 9,000 new cases GA today. [These signs?](http://eaglenewspapers.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2017/03/29/songer_sign_w_t670.jpg?b3f6a5d7692ccc373d56e40cf708e3fa67d9af9d) Yes, lot companies wellness plans incentivize weight loss, smoking cessation, healthy blood sugar blood pressure. sad, always breakthrough cases sort. get hourly happy-ending massages succulent fruit hand-fed every waking-moment? certain? thought knew everything need vaccines?  also provide financial aid university, unemployment, housing, etc poverty stricken. like social services like people portray. They'll catch first Would make sense bring variant specific dose mRNA. FDA already said want 2 months data clinical trials EUA. There’s already on-going clinical trials it. variants going keep mutating. Neighbor tested positive Monday literally day yesterday today. piece shit.  That's appropriate. Dishonorable discharges saved felony level crimes. Rape, murder, war crimes, things nature. 

Don't cheapen it. Refusing vaccine simple administrative separation. Well, duh. think B.1.621 *is* Lambda variant. Getting what? COVID going anywhere, every surge end sometime boosters might help. mainly killing old fat people. Look science. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Appreciate clarifying elective procedures. Idiot would know that. know. Regarding population unfortunate individuals, sucks… IMO sad reflection USAs overall HC system diet lifestyle.

Still kind fucked health care works  Yup. logistics bringing new type vaccine market widespread use smart offering third dose third dose proven incredibly effective -- now.

Simple get this? seems like resistance infection fades vaccine, haven’t gotten enough data say much much certainty. Even faded resistance much better none, might far reduced. 

It seem like resistance severe illness hospitalization mostly stays strong. *as literally pro vax person says every thread* goal vaccine. look vaxxed vs unvaxxed numbers hospitals: still looks good vaxxed people overall. grift fellow idiots care.  know people vaccine recently got sick. still problem? people acknowledging this?  think Pfizer makes less 250million doses month year production. know probably easier switch new variant-targeting booster WT vaccine go nothing making mRNA vaccines. still going transition time quality control steps. maybe end month, could rate 100+ million doses, even get producing 300 million doses month, that's still 40 months get enough doses assuming 2 doses needed, unlikely 40 months.

Unvaccinated people get sick die. Eventually everyone exposed form immunity it. lot savory fried foods bit funky, like steak chicken tenders. Movie theater popcorn sad one, tasted rotten. Thankfully, drinks sweets generally unaffected, fully enjoy desserts time indulge haha So, we’re allowed talk now?

Isn’t made worse vaccine “leaky” makes breeding ground mutations?

Most subs delete comments “conspiracy” 🤦🏻‍♂️ Welp, guess we’ll wait roughly 40% population dies off. say amongst every war, home Christmas Easter something effect. time it’s idiots we’re fighting, they’re neighbors family members time it’s gonna long drawn fight enough die forced comply reality we’re facing. don’t want keep taking different vaccines different variants. people fing get jabbed stop spreading shit already? even available site disused article. feel bad though 5% though bascially killed 95%. wonder alot could made idiots overrun hospital. Oh no?!

Am compassion idiots right? there’s 8th graders may half fully virtual freshman year. wife says sophomores year seem like older 8th graders. Don’t worry, we’re well way LOT natural immunity. won’t vaccine rolled enough population. covid response minister basically already said so. long get new vaccine version approved EUA? I’m saying there’s flip flopping things. Masks helpful, knew that. Yet told everyone aren’t helpful you’re middle pandemic.

Ok, actually know fact. sound reasonable? live Jackson work Josephine. hospital Josephine turned single bed ICU rooms doubles still running space. Jackson much better. However, same.

Yeah unfortunately shoot conspiracies virus manufactured force vaccines yada yada crap want act like agree might best place this, I’m combative I’m legitimately curious. vaccine doesn’t stop people getting covid. still considered vaccine treatment?

Our vaccine rollout literally slowest high risk essentially exposure vaccine uptake prevent massive surge.

Thanks attacking a-hole (talking guy, twoquarters). Nope. Nothing done start adjusting expectations point many people die per year. already number used covid, we'll get used new number. anti-vaxxers never listened Fauci immune information. They're literally choosing die covid rather get shot behave responsibly don't. local children's hospital ran ICU beds week ago many kids got sick lot schools even back session. due mix RSV Covid kids hit double whammy viruses. Multiple school districts Texas close starting seeing numbers like quarter staff students sick quarantined due exposure. We've send people hospitals far away Idaho. That's approximately 1500 miles away nothing available closer.

I see active Charlottesville subreddit. used live there, one favorite places. hope things get bad entirety gulf coast states mess right now.  Same, except covid February I’m Washington. 

I’m curious, foods still taste weird you? it’s mainly coffee, peppers (bell &amp; jalapeño), coke. seems effect acidic things. others can’t remember, I’m trying make list encounter them. found Twitter thread previously COVID positive people, coffee common one. Idk much research done feels strange COVID might making things smell taste funky long time many different people. 

Here’s hoping neither one us gets covid  studies shown viral loads 1000x unvaccinated infections. 75% reduction vaccinated infections pretty damn good. We’re getting heard immunity one way another seems shouldn’t one coughed  love going one part reddit another seeing wrestling references everywhere   Rube questions: released January, long could arms? idea release means already gone necessary testing?  think really true. 

In UK, example, 1.2% infections confirmed/suspected reinfections April 12 June 27 (a period Delta became dominant) ([see pg. 36 higher reinfection Delta Alpha, nevertheless, reinfections major force.

(I'm tired look UK's aggregate infection point point -- would necessary calculate efficacy-like number -- needless say, lot 1.2% Brits infected point) Thats type logic corporations use destroy forests, pollute water, pollute air, underpay workers, destroy cities, corrupt politics, steal property, deny healthcare, start wars etc...etc..etc

I blame idea people use diety excuse want long ""sins forgiven"", free pass. ideological poison. Darwin really interesting article explains screwed 60 years  employees even work on-site offices anyway. ""F*** I'll see tomorrow!"" - covid 19-28 Natural herd immunity is. We’re Plague Rat-Shaming phase. you’re eligible yet remain unvaccinated, you’re beyond reason. Hope makes becomes pro vax. Unlikely alas Please share DM well, I've looking I'm sure I'm finding legit not. Thank you! nurses left care them. burn insane. love LAUSD this. Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead trust virologist says viruses CEO Pfizer.  10 000 people died hospitalized due breakthrough infections. What’s reason assuming none people receiving treatment vaccinated? people like paying arm leg tickets.  !remindme 2 weeks People refuse get vaccinated need think motives who’s trying “kill” them

What’s gain killing 70% America That’s good point playing odds. kind situation, extra-cautious actually riskiest thing could do!

As Canadian member Pfizerna crew, concur assessment “experiments” lengthening intervals mixing vaccines.

It’s pretty clear three week interval doses based expediency completing trials quickly possible, scientific justification thinking would best interval. I’m immunologist, reading analyses, seems like would extremely unusual short period turned ideal giving booster. 

There’s optimism administering third dose, much longer interval second third doses lead development much stronger long-lasting immunity. Nothing ""conspiracy"". CEO wants sell new products. That's literally works. wont last though. Look Israel. Sadly way win thing world leaders afraid of. COVID never going away rednecks gonna redneck (and die) saying since day one pandemic.  Ok colleges Florida going require already? need Satan's butthole says ""Please resist science, need priests here"". Conservative rural America’s Jonestown. can’t self-eliminate lethal virus, maybe horse wormer trick! Natural selection sure. cashing out?  Wait thought COVID wasn’t real? Bunch sunny day fans. us tests required test Covid mid march.. kept saying cases really Canada watching knew shit already control lack testing.. insane watch. Well can't speak everyone, vaccine. group people denies vaccines group people deny lot things science community. simply tired people. nature wants take them. bat eye.

As comment investing beds staffing. invest beds. would okay that. would also okay that, think know stance above. staffing hard. keep hearing articles nurses leaving even enticement higher pay. throw money problem, someone take money. seem like right time goes on, think become even less so.  gotten vaccinated. also (from I've read) apply physical sports. nice soccer season starting I've two seasons young kids begging play masks off. hard easy either. restrictive, I'm honestly surprised whinging comment section. Also people saying gov Brown needs focus vaccinations... highly paranoid state referring ""Vax sins"" ""Brown's needle rape"" spout vaccine killing people (not going wear mask) listen tells get vaccinated No, that’s works all.

An even smaller percentage died: 0.003%.

compare number non vaccinated ICUs place. idea variants coming west, come west, way shape form related ""going lives soon"" ludicrous. 

The variants come literally billions unvaccinated people developing countries, 60%-80% vaccinated first world countries, amount masks grocery store vaccine passports go public events change that. 

They might get **detected** first time west financial technical means decipher it, unlike many countries, odds substantially mutations happening first world. 1 Timothy 2:12 approve statement strange people keep talking endemic use argument dance lifestyle restrictions, something would make endemic.

It’s fact life now. Like flu. You’ll get shot every year that’ll that. Eventually lockdowns masks wane. People won’t live way forever. could 50% chance catching Ebola every time go outside, eventually people would go outside. isn’t sustainable long term - people inevitably revert pre COVID behavior point. many “no shit articles” need see No, cases shoot ""*due breakthroughs*"".

Yes, lot breakthrough infections one would expected efficacy original strain. **BUT,** main problem still unvaccinated, since delta much transmissible. reason cases shot up.

But again, also think, adjusting vaccine Delta would make lot sense. think, one reason takes long go clinical trials again.  try come scenarios I'm angry. yes, covid deniers, anti maskers, anti vaxxers make angry, figure way make *accountable*.   


Less priviledges move freely attend entertainment venues, air travel, etc. also hit HARD wallets.....that something \*understand\*.  

They denying care truly need ICU treatment tragedy. Herd immunity function R-naught (basic reproductive number R0)

Herd immunity calculated 1-(1/R0). average Covid patient infects 7 people, R0 7, means need 85% population immune herd immunity kick in. R0 higher theres higher threshold. 

That's arrive number.  Take note, America Ferarra! don’t need make funny covid pandemic god given right work somewhere else.

Also, July Delta became 50% cases (page 13). data mostly Alpha. presumably, looking even worse WT infection Delta. live Linn, ICU beds county counties region 2.

Pharma CEOs best interests heart, goal make money. sell governments preordering boosters perpetuity that's great bottom line. Everyone getting infected gets us closer herd immunity least. real worry less lag time til new vaccine trouble revaccinating. huge logistics cost hurdle convincing people vaccines work (even though really do) met bother new variant happen need another vaccine obviously work need new doses. expect lower vaccine rate now.

EDIT: Ugh natural immunity also worth less vaccine reinfection based much percentage immune escape new variant would be. Anything 50% would resetting clock back January. Nope, isn't. live Lomita. Throughout whole pandemic seen maybe 4 people without masks indoors. way believe it’s 10% people outside walks/ exercising wearing masks, maybe believable. ""just flu"". 

The problem people generally know wtf flu actually is. think headcold. 

The flu joke. sure is, home. true. billions vaccinated, dozen thousand dropped dead vaccine causing severe immune body responses. perfectly within reason. U still get vaccinated. gonna wait like year coincidentally vaccinated people high risk first wait pretty much year anyway. Get man Nobel prize really backing corner, though?

As conditional statement, basically ""if succeed, fail"". mentioning specifically? paying attention anti-vaxing movement COVID? really pick probably controversial vaccine, MMR, COVID vaccine example something people feel differently about. multiple measles outbreaks parents refusing vaccine. modern anti-vaxing movement started almost three decades ago Andrew Wakefield published fabricated study Lancet using false evidence linking autism MMR vaccine. lost medical license, damage public health welfare single person since then.

Vaccines mandated decades atrocities resulted. kabuki part. read multiple times. Phase 3 trials supposed go 2023 spread rate.

This assertion false. true small percentage breakthrough cases similar viral load unvaccinated people, transmissibility rate unknown viral load similar fraction time (3-4 days). 

A scenario: visit group 1000 vaccinated people contact covid past week. 5 (0.5% based North Carolina Dept Health study) get breakthrough case. Assuming 5 people infected week ago, high transmissibility window passed, extremely unlikely catch something.

Now tell scenario work 1000 unvaccinated people exposed covid past week. Wish one hand, shit Oh we're getting 90% immunity one way another.  Yes. Yes, could. since strain exist yet, can't start working new vaccine right away. We'd almost back square one, issuing emergency use, good luck convincing people already wary current ones. got jabs March, there's data point you. isn’t wrong. It’s God given right f***ing moron. boosters becoming thing. I’d love see number breakthrough cases days since fully vaccinated. guess many breakthrough cases happening people got vaccinated early effect lowered enough couldn’t fight getting sick. Basically point Covid like car crash happen. 

The vaccine like seatbelt 

No guarantees either way odds drastically favor one enough people get naturally develop antibodies become like common cold flu. would much sooner young health gained natural immunity last year. risk quarantined herd immunity taken hold. less effective vaccines variations. transmission became staggered giving life generations COVID. variations happened slowed spread county 38% fully vaxxed.  trouble world stupid cocksure intelligent full doubt.”

Thank unvaccinated BS.   movie 8th grade depicts well. Middle school kids biggest assholes you’ll ever meet Damn. looks like hurt. Must messed toes long while. fauci saying fully vaxed people don’t need masks, even delta. 2 weeks later isn’t true? probably think lawyers, police, judges, politicians paid say things, DR’s SCIENCE Holy shit, sucks. went USC years ago definitely would ruined experience I’m rooting them.

Thank much. one drew parallel

Who really think crazy can’t see that? Man, pessimist saying would last year started, I’m fool. Agreed completely. natural immunity always completely ignored?

Obviously, vaccine-induced immunity much preferable getting immunity way (EDIT: clear, folks make immunity gained ""the way"" even stronger getting vaccinated). pretend can't important part contributing population immunity levels wrong Or....the 40 percent Israel said several weeks ago.....why earth use data handed us countries experiencing changes first? cursory glance comments surrounding topic show many people concerned forcibly making people destitute refusing authoritative overreach returning society semblance normality.  

This makes sense. People concerned making anyone else destitute. People *are* concerned protecting love. correct, morally good thing - taking vaccine - available nationwide several months now. people, concerned safety, witnessed fellow Americans concerned phantasmal erosions personal rights right, morally good thing - taking vaccine.  

If everyone could trusted pay damages caused driving *need* mandate automobile insurance. everyone could trusted willfully support communities donations need mandate property taxes. And, course, people could trusted get vaccinated free *need* mandate vaccination condition participating daily life.  

We deal reality, now, eternal boogeyman dressed concern freedoms. turn unvaccinated people away they’ll infect others, vaccinated unvaccinated. It’s safer share resources.  may latest guidance, late 2020 thought negative result 6 months might infected shouldn’t taken definitive it’s possible antibodies could waned undetectable level (a positive result consisted relatively definitive time). So, couldn’t hurt check, it’s negative you’ll likely never “know” sure. Bourla added Pfizer could produce new versions vaccine combat variant within three months discovery. ""We built process within 95 days day identify variant variant concern, able vaccine tailor-made variant,"" Bourla said.

Fucking modern medicine amazing! 

And people freak please realize boils basic evolution. Basically virus propagates reproduces, likely mutate. said article also mentions scientists believe SARS-COV-2 continues mutate eventually lose ability infect people. there's that...fascinating stuff really. Curious, one get antibody test? I’m third moderna virus month first vaccinated

I’m planning vaccinating kids us personally. pandemic ends vaccinated .  Yes exponential day larger increase. absolutely need get control gets manageable zone. big word. get doctors rural areas advocate vaccine opposed spreading doubt fueling fear. somehow depoliticize it. Americans stop acting self-centered think communities vulnerable among us. Big word, IF.  Correct Tim Dillon show. Welp, disappointing see CDC completely misconstrue study citing.

[If read compares individuals previously COVID *and vaccinated* COVID vaccinated. found lower rates *reinfections* amongst vaccinated.

Thus, study compare vaccine induced immunity natural immunity. says -- among previously infected -- vaccination still boosts immunity.

But press release study, declares triumphantly ""Vaccination Offers Higher Protection Previous COVID-19 Infection."" 

Sigh. wonder long covid antibodies found. virus Sept 2019, always wondered covid around longer. probably covid, typical cold. Wound permanent ear vestibular damage. government what’s dictating life next 4-5 years. you’re Vaccinated genuinely need keep giving fuck gotta remember worrying issue never solve said issue, said previous similar comments exactly like meteor big ol space rock either fling sky destroy us either way matter much time let eat outcome shall change end  think, spirit AA, people start Morons Anonymous. 

""Hello, I'm Cleatus I'm moron""

Hello, Cleatus! 🤦🏼‍♂️ primary care doctor me. cant comment costs. zero me. Covered insurance. don’t lol. stopped giving shit six months ago It’s mixed bag. almost certainly close zero severe cases test group, last heard, also nearly severe cases placebo group. Kids’ lower risk makes getting comparative data harder.  much antivax. Well ya, plenty them. told can’t live life unless receive vaccine created beyond realistic timeframe authorized Trump admin pre approved FDA what, less 100 hrs… Yeah many people still gonna get even FDA approval, I'll tell what. approve one them(J&amp;J example) would give lot confidence ones approved means formality sake. mean when's last time millions upon millions people already got something approval. I'm sure happened often. 

It's like actually approve it? Imagine backlash, would absolutely insane. possibly open box. gonna get approved matter what. Someone ask prove it. It’s infectious. friend unvaccinated both, severity Found optimist! know medical field friends definitely getting worn people refuse vaccinations tout conspiracy take horse medicine, seek medical care get covid.  amazing read. Coming CEO company stand gain lot fear mongering sell products definitely makes less credible, would prefer organizations like CDC trying sugar-coat things time upfront concerns. Things like ""get vaccines go back normal"" leads people becoming less trusting institutions come back shortly like ""haha, kidding. Put masks back stay away public places again."" 

Obviously basing recommendations decline cases current dominant variants. enough data know would not. serious concern given attention people would know things may change variants come data long-term effectiveness vaccines rolls in. 

I want working shadows, keeping expertise leaving public shocked hospitals suddenly overflowing again. Lol, that’s first I’ve seen one. Couple months? hope you’re right Insurers deny hospital expenses unvaccinated COVID patients honestly recall source, recent story important point: masks reduce aerosols extent, wearing worthwhile.

I especially enjoy anti-maskers claim masks ineffective, also claim can't breathe block oxygen. right thing. Depending data set, covid 20-1000x less likely spread outside. That's everyone talking opening windows schools.

This nothing pandemic theater we're done it. bomb threats charges coughing yelling plea to.    Sure.. intial wild type sure.. Alpha Delta changed that.. study june 2020.. year outdated. 

Based current reports children hospitalization time high  douche going like Hep B vaccine.

God, really hope so. 

I say though many people forget coronavirus influenza virus. think lot people default comparing coronavirus influenza Spanish Flu last major pandemic different viruses assume we'll need yearly vaccine covid like flu. Maybe will. that's given, either, point.  guys heard deez variant Happy help. learned it! Checkout wapo article, go calculated etc Even got released hospital day caught COVID, would longer infectious 18th month. think he's lying easy prove timeline showing COVID test hospital records really excellent, looking for.

Yep. Last saw AZ still unvaccinated. still ton unvacced chew through. fucking embarrassed state live in. That’s fair. and/or Grandma vaccinated? SARS-COV-2 continues mutate eventually lose ability infect people

if does, strain would die immediately 100%. Doctors feel uncomfortable making kinds calls. want save every life. outsourcing problem rest society. want able treat COVID patients means millions people go work. worth fair, especially post-vaccine. cost benefit add up. COVID endemic, build clinics. really.. made call data available.

The decision heavily weighed twice amount people protection vs full protection vs protection.. right call.  Boosters normally given 6-12 months initial doses lead longer term immunity higher efficacy.  also knew mRNA vaccines given short dosing schedules speed collection safety efficacy data.

Educated decision based history weighed heavily providing people protection.     gender race it? matter? I'm saying forced vaccinated, restrictions prevent hospitals burdened applied entire population select group responsible boat son then, senior high school March 2020. Looking forward thing like prom getting walk stage front people know family graduation recieve diploma. 2 week early spring break announced, quickly came, extended. We, quite obviously never went back. 

I must admit, feel robbed pandemic. Nit missed things like prom graduation. joined Army afterwards. seeing family day graduated basic, could attend one proudest achievements person. also extends AIT. I'm extremely proud I've spent last year doing, there's many things generation missed on. 

Especially point life achieving many things quickly, want pandemic end celebrate achievements families again, rites passage come back.

Right now, suspect runs way, managers trying find fluff code insurers pay them. vertically integrated, would try find every excuse cut costs, would hope mean cutting corners.

I markets work, nature health care makes really bad fitting market pricing. rife imperfect information natural monopolies. shame one figured non-market solution... worst happens we're prepared it, evidence overprepared since even bad. /s 70%, 79% reduction transmission. time N95s extreme 


Most definitely material matters, N95s electrostatic well.

I assume referencing recent study University next variant comes along changes mind…. again. It’s ok though, Bill Gates save us all. 🙄🙄🙄 would billionaire another $999,997,000.00. Life throws lessons learn them. Deny science? Here’s deadly preventable disease you. 🎁 Maybe get gen 3/4 vaccines? Things like nasal/inhaled vaccines provide secretory antibodies pan-covid vaccines would probably go long way getting handle virus. that, refuse vaccines, masks, social distancing obstacles solid control covid.

Also, think current production estimates current vaccines nearly enough vaccinate everyone wants vaccines time soon. could least accomplish that, would put us lot better place get ahead variants. may year away? depends much boosters needed. 

So I'm pessimistically expecting couple years dealing science manufacturing catch enough going back normal extended period (eventually could another novel pandemic, hopefully decades, could bring back stage 1).  millions doses week. mandates FDA approval, expect increase. 90% high bar, though. feel climate change. COVID seems like test run see humanity come together work toward common goal. So, I'm thinking we'll either bake death, suffocate atmosphere, whichever comes first. so? bfd..  would one keep year's supply food? 

Buy pallet long lasting foodstuffs keep years expired, replace new lot?

Buy one years worth canned type food, keep eating one year old stuff replacing new canned stuff?

Neither option sounds ideal me. petulant children. Almost one Portland likely seriously put this. people know much interested staying informed taking whatever measures protect families complete strangers alike. rules appear perfect.

What's more, indoors outdoors concepts, hard features reality. outdoor spaces risky others, delta transmissible enough exploit that.  following health directives global pandemic quite mental also know ends -- Facebook memes. think discrediting all! conversations important helpful! rigor vaccine judged stays same. expectations set safety wise, puts anyone ease. folks know boosters created sent market, means original vaccine effective safe expect booster follow suit. people get released hospital still infectious? Also, hes lieing? pretty hefty cough. asked us turn AC. urgency Thailand ‘learning live Covid-19’ country's economy heavily dependent upon tourism. need people coming out. Correct, however current data seems show natural immunity fades faster vaccine immunity. result coronaviruses work. Wow It’s official AP title actually works news headline context data day behind.

“Woman coughed market produce, claimed virus gets jail” read “Woman coughed market produce **and** claimed [she infected corona]virus gets jail.”

Not greatest headline. article even tell readers take covid, mentions kind people taking large animals. almost telling go get small dosages vaccinated US (we're 50% vaccinated) ~4. Ro unvaccinated delta Dies Darkness

Across United States, number coronavirus cases has skyrocketed, leading calls public health officials to mask up regardless vaccination status. Many vaccinated people asking whether it’s time get booster dose. math behind spread infectious diseases like covid-19 help us see it’s not.

Support journalism. Subscribe today.

The change coronavirus guidance Centers Disease Control Prevention local authorities came delta variant, epidemiologists estimate basic reproductive number 6 9. basic reproductive number, R0 (pronounced arr-naught), measure average number people directly infected single infectious person scenario one population immunity disease. original virus caused covid-19 an R0 3, meaning someone infected April 2020 would, average, infect three others. delta variant is two three times infectious; average, one infected person may infect six nine people none vaccinated prior infection.

But basic reproductive number alone doesn’t tell whole story. really understand expect delta variant, need consider vaccinations, natural immunity precautions people taking lower chances exposed, wearing masks social distancing. that, epidemiologists calculate another measure, called effective reproduction number, (pronounced arr-eee). helps us estimate much disease may spread population least immunity. Technically speaking, measures many new people single person infects, accounting whatever precautions people taking overall immunity levels. Whether we’re talking R0, value larger 1 means trouble, person infect one person, disease outbreak continue spread exponentially unless take action.

Story continues advertisement

The place time calculated R0 using fairly simple equation: Multiply R0 proportion population susceptible disease. proportion expressed 1 minus proportion population immune disease, incorporate different types immunity. mathematical terms, equation would Re=Ro*(1-x*v), x*v proportion population immune, x percentage people fully immune (i.e., vaccinated) v vaccine’s effectiveness.

Understanding formula yield important intuition boosters aren’t yet helpful, let’s walk simplified example supposing everyone population vaccinated.

Calculating effective vaccines new variants challenging, epidemiologists estimated two-dose vaccines are about 85 percent effective against delta variant. That’ll value v, one important caveat — simplicity, assuming vaccines effectiveness, don’t great data vaccines differ delta variant. demonstration purposes, we’ll use R0 8 (although range 6 9, try values see things change). Based numbers, estimate would around 1.2 able vaccinate 100 percent population. That’s still higher 1, barely, it’s definitely within range control measures frequent testing contact tracing would probably enough stop outbreak.

Story continues advertisement

But don’t expect everyone vaccinated. Tuesday, about 50 percent of U.S. population fully vaccinated. Taking account 85 percent efficacy vaccines, means 43 percent population protected delta variant. scenario R rate Israel dropped since August 1st (they started rollout boosters). ~71% eligible population R number, basic reproduction number virus, falling since early August, Monday stood 1.14, compared 1.36 August 1. R rate 1 indicates every infected person infect one person average, rate 1 means virus spread Faces. it? Obviously ability provide care exceeds people need everyone recieve equal treatment. resources limited factors come play.

If two 30 year olds come covid, one fully vaccinated, underlying health conditions means they'll less likely recover care less getting vaccine intention ever getting one underlying health problems one bed... 

What suggesting preventable case, would likely lead hospitalisation vaccinated, recieve preferential treatment healthy. Essentially care prioritised born better genes. fate sealed moment born inferior genes speak life choices, thing control absolutely role play conversation. correct? else treatment allocated lucky enough born better genes less fortunate could protect themselves?  No, medical professionals projecting fall 2022 since end last year. based people’s actions end 2020. I'm still interested getting it, giving someone else, giving kid, etc. careful person general. case, would nice see 93 year old grandma feel good it. on. downvoted - really important ask questions get right answer! would rather people ask put ease. appreciate bringing up.  Oh no, Anyways… Makes sense since they're facing client traveling time. smart enough anyway. radicalized military personnel soon. Morona virus strikes probably going trying lock patent. doubt intend manufacture something reduce demand product. Upper Midwest fine. Don’t lump everyone convenient boxes. comedy though? There’s something said laughing shared experience… even it’s horrible That’s really headlines written though. Less more. Especially newspaper/article headlines. one fine imo serves purpose separating two descriptions: “coughed market produce” “claimed virus”. 

The headline could “woman coughed market produce gets jail”, “woman claimed virus gets jail” would fine. Since want include (obviously) needed single comma separate  worked once. Fuck company shitty growth potential I'm super glad see move. Hope encourages larger companies same.  Pity. What’s dinner? That’s said last year! We’re fucked.. That's works lol. can't put vaccines water supply. right endanger health safety others. See comment (and comment) flu vaccine created! Like poster mentioned, covid vaccine tough get ahead amount surveillance we've flu vaccine. nearly impossible proactive covid vaccine point time. fact lambda variant working booster fantastic though. Still, relies fact virus mutate horribly January release. boss told us pack work items two weeks 😂 vaccines require booster every 6 months would say bit noticeable difference. thought types deserve mention dictionary ""hypocrite"" entry, think mentioned ""Irony"" definition.

But course speedy recovery wished for, harrumph, harrumph. Thank you. anyone downvoting question: asked earnest. mostly making self deprecating humor, I'm curious occupations referring to. use degree current work. going make booster vaccines mRNA specific delta variant? read looking 12+ full approval application September. Leopards ate face.  live Norway  Sorry believe viral creationism. think god personally creates variant &lt;3/s Godruitfulright Great article research. would lead believe conspiracy science government want inoculate vaccine etc. know, microchips etc. opposite, types venues investigated stop virus. You’ve jumped getting vaccine wearing hazmat suit. You’re reaching see right? 

It might helpful read vaccines work. It’s full proof way prevent disease. Picture like someone vaccine army 10 men. unvaccinated men. virus air 9 particles vaccinated won’t get sick. 14 likely will. 

On flip side vaccinated person likely expel 5 particles unvaccinated going expel say 20. (This simplified right record)

So put two vaccinated people room. one covid doesn’t realize yet still likely won’t get vaccinated person sick. 

Put unvaxed vaxed person may expel 20 particles meaning vaxed persons army can’t fight off. 

This getting vaccinated important. It’s viral load immune systems lower part. It’s like boat sinking 5 us bailing water boat. 5 sitting there. Either get boat doesn’t weigh help bail water. right unvaxed like unneeded weight already taxed system. It’s weighing us creating problems be. Awesome stuff, don’t already tailor make yearly flu vaccine whatever strain de jure flu season? simple. parts world can't afford vaccine campaings national scale. Eventually virus mutate reach cause can't contain it. unless vaccinate whole world population reasonable time span, wich never happen even everyone willing take shot, still problem  also honest acknowledge comment section better. Even commentors trying darnedest facts, they’re still likely qualified really responding. That's lot 95 days though. variants around This. much this. vaccine works. healthy fully vaccinated chances heavily side.

I still think wearing mask indoors avoiding crowds smart testing defences often never good idea. part pandemic healthy vaccinated. what? ""Eventually"" shows agree anytime soon.

The Plague (Black Death, specifically thinking of) around ~7 years everyone susceptible died off. Cruise ships go foreign country though I'm sure knows that. shit Pfizer: moneymoneymonyemoneygivemeyourfuckingmoney cousin former nurse Yamhill. begging elderly friends Facebook get vaxxed, still lot friends doctors nurses seeing first hand chaos ERs. disheartened see barrage nasty replies needs “do research” vaccines killing people, covid. known decades, still listen kooks medically trained friend best interests heart. really convincing people. there's mandatory vaccines, free masks patents vaccine course likely emerge many dumbfucks vaccinating helping virus chances mutate. guess new mutation emerge Florida still gona emerge part world can't afford mass vaccination campaigns like rich countries, eventually spread can't stop happening, least good excuse act like week hope see current exponential increase stopped even better, reversed. popular term ""flatten curve"" meaning ""no longer exponential"". call hurricanes hoax. effect. God damn Obama that’s 

/s mean, term ""vaccine-resistant"" sounds like vaccines work all, doubt ever black white situation. efficacy could drop, probably never zero sudden. indeed variants vaccines less effective, like South African (P1) variant. luckily contagious variant, dominate. Maybe chances mutation makes virus contagious resistant vaccines small?  Six months ago February, height second wave. US losing thousands day. Meanwhile, NZ Covid Free. 

I think would wise NZ go hard immunisation world needed more. 

I’ll go back Triage rules - ordered early could, nations needed us time. waited.

Whether choose forced wait immaterial. position need vaccine immediately. 

We still strong position, outbreak doesn’t change that. still plan made back March, vaccinated 25% population last 30 days pretty awesome, picking steam. Would love see venn diagram ""Antivaxxers"" ""Antimaskers"". Yea someone know thought way too. he’s ICU fighting life. given 4 people mom included. 

Your body likely won’t handle it, also risking lives others. Remember Trump told us would gone April 2020 heat would kill it? Breach leak? Seems convenient. Yeah. lot people takeout, nearly everyone. Vaccines free? kind weird subscription models thinking cost money? ""Guys see ^a ^^storm, ^^^^do ^^^^^^youuuuuuuuuuuu?????????""  Texas mandating vaccine?  Take out, friend, take out.  Yep. There’s verse Bible advising leave camp need shit, bury you’re done. Great advice don’t access sanitation plumbing. Oregon sounds like insane place live considering events transpiring past years. point, yes. would propose eating without taking mask...? They'd cult leader MLM scheme within month. call target rich environment.  current vaccine 80-90% effective delta. That’s good measure, since also works strains virus, well best possible formula moment. move back animal population exclusively way through. get significant number people immunized either natural infection vaccination. Vaccination would ideal we’d save lives either way works. virus endemic we’ll developed protection future. virus won’t change much. mutation spike significant render newly mutated strain useless change morphology spike protein significant bind properly binding site. Well, there's issue. Taking public. Mythic Quest? Apparently episode season Zoom? see though. Uh yes, yes would. _If everyone_ it. kind consensus impossible, 🤷‍♂️ Username checks thought they’d created vaccine within days given virus’ makeup. 

Moderna produced first batch vaccine Feb 7, 2020, 25 days China shared genetic sequence Jan 11, 2020. maybe takes longer get mass production fair, people freaking also unlikely believe evolution. Rabies sounds lot like meth bing.  Yeah, Japan's vaccination speed good, got started super-late. think good place months, then, things dicey. quite hard mean many things. felt hit quite hard vaccination, meant high fever felt unwell.  would say likely lower protection time vaccination. Like see Israel. 
We need vaccines guess. Every 3 months?? willing pay take country needs more? 

Why would we?

There finite amount vaccine, especially last year NZ ordered it. Well yeah, agree going hard way. disagree going anytime soon. Every variant worse last unlike viruses, Covid produces many asymptomatic cases long period time presymptomatic people spread virus disease take population. selection pressure towards reduced virulence like influenza viruses onset symptoms transmissibility tightly linked. thing affects Covid transmission changes human behavior, like vaccination masking, fuck already know working. explain scariest part rabies you, leave rest mystery.

When start notice symptoms, late. already dead. Seriously, amazing many people still gone back normal pre-2020 living. think secretly liked 1.5 years using ""when end"" excuse keep living like that. far Taiwan mainly used AZ Moderna, good chunk come donations US Japan. Medigen (which vaccine made Taiwanese company) starting used Monday deliveries Pfizer doses supposedly starts soon. never played Plague Inc...

Uuuuhh... serious question, ""birds shit"" reference birds literal shit? shit birds stuff?  Beg differ, anecdote part pattern deeply concerning. case whatever good infecting people (e.g. strain mutation) keep infecting people. many people consistently failed realise. case lock hurt economy 'crack on' hurt health system. locking going hurt both, lockdowns lesser two evils. hint UK 'pingdemic' people work droves due told isolate track trace app. elsewhere (as case) we're seeing reality it. people already has. people taken verocell vaccine allowed travel Europe countries? vaccines provide 80% protection. prop ability 22 31 catching 0,000000074

It likely due close proximity long exposure time made possible small ""tight"" group. Duhh…. English degree like literature? extremely well read? Seems widely applicable lot jobs.

Or bicker vs you’re day? Alright. 

Then show work then. I’m happy take look math use prove *opinion*.

If it’s simple, please show me! I’m happy learn. show work. 

But stress *again* Dr. Ashley Bloomfield lot knowledgeable us. says [cases exponential trust expert analysis decidedly non-expert opinion.

But see numbers week. :-) flu vaccine targets 2-4 strains/variants

Why put many strains flu vaccines possible (e.g. 20+ strains) instead trying guess 2-4 strains? Viruses living beings! swear, amount times seen this...does nobody remember high school biology.

Even Matrix got wrong. google translation: ""It gone someone expressed almost closed nostrils one morning, over, someone hit quite hard"" Didn’t data Lollapalooza confirm outdoor transmission highly unlikely attendees required follow vaccination testing policy admission concert? course GoFundMe already raised Positively reinforcing self-entitled behavior Denmark cannot chose vaccine get cases, guess mix four vaccines. way knowing. fingers crossed Covid-19 ""die out"" becoming new cell structure.

Sure, odds great... Yeah think tough really stamp thing out.

Japan really shitty vaccination rates even wonderful mask adoption. (canada) great vaccination rates, big centers decent mask rates, lockdowns totally ineffective compared places like New Zealand Australia, there's places like Brazil, Mexico, India US... Yeah make sense, maybe become highly contagious less deadly. Welp. We're fucked. Why, isn’t impressive enough? vaccines provide 80% protection. prop ability 22 31 catching 0,000000074 that’s stupid. Don’t force needles peoples arms. also hate 'pa-riss' instead 'pa-ree'? 40 times ? collect breakthrough data hospitalized die. get covid. …. get second cat it’s shot Well, yeah, that's exactly point. One way other, via vaccination sickness death, get there.  
Sadly, looks like we're going get hard way, like Plague eventually ended Middle Ages Europe. Im assuming vax pfizer moderna? That's exactly true.

There animals humans.

Humanity lucky small pox incapable spread animals. case, small pox would probably humanity forever.

Covid-19 spread animals, therefore, probably humanity forever. strain lost ability infect people could still spread animals eventually back humans. Whoever going vaccinate already has. Save breath, Fauci. Yeah, current variant, maybe, would need another 70% globally reach levels immunity, take years best case scenario. heard breakthrough infections? Look Delta ripping relatively highly vaxxed population. next variant going us? going get past accept global problem county, state US problem. key ""at earliest""... pandemics last years could end anywhere month 2024. Oh wrote thesis virology dethrone Pfizer’s ceo cuz profit. indeed subsidized student. Okay, aware. Thanks. Although still can’t find reference hospitalisation anywhere. said, don’t even think “sane” goal. certainly don’t.

Nonetheless, *are* legit epidemiologists advocating (see:@EpiEllie Twitter, prof BU, example). also clear. healthcare professional, condone kicking unvaxed people die alone, wish death turmoil anyone. 

But. I’m trying help convey healthcare professionals feeling fighting hard past year, still trusted meme saw FB, favorite radio/tv talking head.   Thank you, hope get feeling better too.  want sit front seat me? Lol like poured liquid fire try put liquid gasoline world fire.

And everything fine. Australia going waaay hard direction us. Source: Floridian.  calculating 85% “bare minimum”? think healthcare ""collapse"" enough staff walk hospitals become unusable. think that's unlikely though many people stuck job half nurses antivax anyway probably care. protest COVID-19 testing Broward schoolsBrooke Baitinger  parents flocked Broward County School Board meeting Tuesdayto protest coronavirus testing proposed three buildings.The parents cited concerns — circulated social media — achemical used sterilizing medical devices, including nasal swabs usedfor testing.

People responsible took precautions going die od selfish assholes. know!! :(

Did hear Neighborhood Council sent letter city opposing vaccine mandate? listened Zoom meeting go first draft insane might think - Nazi Germany yellow stars, tyranny, leper colonies, etc. etc.

I think need huge GOTV effort next time. like 65,000 people hundred voted NC election. Yeah… *why?*

Why poor people, uneducated people, black people getting vaccinated? supported Trump? (I mean, obviously comes black folks). poor uneducated?

My point is, Trump correlation causation. people would’ve probably largely gone unvaxxed regardless. thought Conservative? Genuinely asking, lazy google. shit! Good luck that. banjo playing hicks busy banging cousin popping caps prevent preventable. But…horse laxatives work! ton friends freshman dorm talking spring break (which week lockdowns started) everyone saying ""well I'll see y'all late April, time finals."" voiced opinion us never going back dorm except pack stuff leave. hated right...

Given bad Delta is, need excellent vaccines, ""not bad"" vaccines. (showerthought) vaccinations mandated prisons, would give people last days death row? appreciate way put that. Grieving need social support. Sometimes need hug others cry… need able look others eyes connection.

I'm sorry, thank family member patient FL hospital COVID right now. (my sister-in-law) ICU briefly seems getting better slowly (still long way go). Yes, unvaxxed, sweet person. Scared vaccine misinformed sure, although brother vaxxed best try convince her. another one who's realized mistake regrets choice.

I've thinking lot people caring her. know must exhausted frustrated right now. 

I'm sure say really see appreciate you. hope rest develop enough natural immunity catching disease decrease spread

I’ve protected myself, whole world stand still? I’m sure it’s complicated understand it’s really frustrating it’s year pandemic sign things returning normal. 😂😂 Nobody knowledge viruses knew couple months. I'm shocked we've gotten vaccine 70% vaccinated short amount time. doubt all. GOP benefits LOT creating / maintaining boogey men actually anything. Keeping people angry keeps cash / votes flowing. Immigration control another example. politician wants ACTUAL solutions. want angry base whip donations / votes. let get straight…

He’s paying lip service “encouraging” vaccines, requiring vaccines state employees, teachers, anything like that. Instead issued executive order prohibiting businesses Florida “requiring patrons customers provide documentation certifying COVID-19 vaccination”.

Meanwhile, despite significant levels spread Florida strain hospitals, refuses issue statewide mask mandate. went banned mask mandates schools he’s attempting pull salaries school board members defy trying getting board members replaced.

Basically nothing mitigate spread, perhaps it’s accurate say, actively working measures mitigate spread.

Instead mitigation measures, he’s encouraging people go get Regeneron’s monoclonal antibodies if/when get sick.

And despite fact biggest campaign contributor confirmed investments Regeneron,… isn’t money? 

Why everything possible let highly contagious infectious disease run rampant state? Yet promote treatment? What’s end game?  Pro-booster, agree data boosters would useful. still think least at-risk people get boosters (if least 6 months), people probably isolate much possible wear good masks properly get info (which assume happen 8 months non-at-risk people could get vaccine - not, getting boosters based limited data probably still good idea unless gen2 vaccine expected immediate future).  anyone know possible treatments field hospitals?. never seen one. anyone still listening jackass? YA! Screw sorry \* holes! Sent pm Poor downvoters going shut hospitals contract COVID. one sympathy literal prevention mechanism involve poisoning horse dewormers. Sorry. data shows 88% hospitalization. think literally cultural awareness empathy half countries are. even get people admit mask ideal cases raging.

We 70% adult vaccination rate, talking about?

Your mass vaccination plan would cover everybody planet order work. western countries, ones ""cultural awareness"" get vaccinated, Somalia, Afghanistan, etc. don't, continue mutate spread. ""solution"" unrealistic. pass herd immunity achieved, mostly natural infection given world population outside West. Ouch   Erradication basically impossible since infect multiple organisms (Cats, Tigers, Minks few). know lot anxious parents. feel you. let get right. need make people feel way out. nonsense hear mind boggling. 

A guy told today bad news me. said what? said 79 year old aunt said vaccine kill 2 years.  said two years live might well live up. record guy vaccinated believe that. wanted make laugh. aunt really believes stated. need everyone. majority country, 70%, vaccinated figured out. ones dying. Hospital staff: space left cafeteria tables.

Hospital staff: Oh hospital full. set field hospital middle school two blocks away. point.

So defense asked step outside. point (normally) friends family hug clap wait. 

At point one advisor committee room argue. missing? need add? proven case? not? 

Now argue one two things happen:

1. open door advisor asks come back in. happens going tell can't sign doctorate collectively come plan salvage work. worst case scenario rarely ever happens.

I vaccinated. I'm getting real close longer giving shit pandemic. advised take **live virus** vaccines. None Covid vaccines that.

There's else viable go. made lol  There’s really much reason seriously concerned children far. might unknown long term consequences line, mortality rates continued along pattern delta variant original virus. elderly high risk serious health problems, children rarely issues all.

That’s say shouldn’t take measures reduce chances getting covid, like would virus, don’t see delta variant changing equation much there. I’m kind worried boosters though, months first, vulnerable, wave people needing boosters wear earlier people don’t get right away see another spike deaths. Especially kids going school/interacting more, people going back work, holidays, etc. Please find source this. ""news source"" (which actually opinion piece, although understandable can't tell since [most people dumb tell says encouraged people take vaccine. ""omission"".

So exactly talking about? guess, I'd say mad telling people get vaccine every 24 hours. currently FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines live vaccines therefore be safely administered immunocompromised people.

The spike make changes limit antibody's ability bind parts spike still able job infecting. surfaces proteins complex different grooves charged regions. Add fact proteins natural movement, surprising flexibility bind. 

There's sometimes trade-offs, known could variant comparable higher transmissibility, similar immune evasion, similar virulence compared Delta. There's papers suggesting there's specific known mutants could help evade immune system, ones already exist seem particularly bad, ones exist real viruses (only pseudoviruses require multiple specific mutations) worrisome ones. 

Unfortunately, good experiments said pseudoviruses done, even know would perform vitro assay. Ideally, would data animal tests. unknown. experts things possible. 

Something worries problematic variants (B.1.351 Delta, example) arose without vaccines (there still natural immunity people infected). vaccination rates increase, selective pressure variants evade immunity. could cost infectivity/transmissibility non-vaccinated hosts, group relatively uncommon really important good infecting them. Yep - sister-in-law posting social media Jan 2020 telling us stock masks, hand sanitizer, etc. even sent us bunch supplies make sure everyone least something use shit hit fan. contenders /r/hermancainaward months people get vaccinated would really helpful. kid tests positive Covid, schools require classmates test negative return. take appointments could used treat non Covid related healthcare issues.

It’s statistically already you’re vaccinated Shes pretty standard NY right leaning dem similar Cuomo truth never stopped anyone.  yet many third world citizens even gotten first dose. virus defeated vaccinating everyone, administering booster doses.

* [March government buys enough Pfizer cover entire population using single vaccine. could streamline supply delivery single vaccine.

* already purchased orders number vaccines Janssen, AstraZenneca, Novavax.

* MedSafe able approve Pfizer first, went whole country (and pacific islands like Cook Islands) 

Given vaccines different storage requirements, wait know one would approved create infrastructure that. 

So… mean? 

We bought bunch vaccines early, wait regulatory approval began. need rush approval *we Covid free* ability rush emergency approval due diligence also could watch US UK began vaccination. 

That’s key. weren’t going get vaccinations new year, didn’t know vaccines would approved first, know, executed plan.

Nah bro, I'm young healthy, need it, thanks! CDC currently using 90 days post infection count vaccinated exposure. So, assume got 90 days protection - get shot. Please give evidence whereas virus slow mutation rate mostly generates point mutations small insertions deletions evade t-cell immunity. 

There evidence antibody binding escape motifs spike protein receptor binding domain immunodominant, point mutations abrogate large amount focused humoral response, simply believe say evidence escaping cellular based immunity. create mutated coronavirus can't people sick county bit 70% implemented another mask mandate. ICUs almost full (I hear taking people southern states close use full). One local hospital cancelling non essential surgeries. high vaccine rate combined things making vocal anti vaccine group even louder - saying rate vaccination high need another mask mandate. Many think immune system protect them, many fallen conspiracies. many gotten vaccine, I’ve personally witnessed lot taking Covid seriously community. didn’t take long know wish someone would figure way make happen Please downvote comment.

Spell out, come I'm tired people. There’s gotta illegal routes take getting vaccine no? Like there’s vaccines damn CVS, remember Canada everyone scrambling get vaccine AstraZeneca widely available, 40+. approved Moderna Pfizer 18+, wasn’t enough go around friend DM’d groupchat saying knew guy pharmacy would illegally give AstraZeneca. didn’t follow thankfully Pfizer/Moderna shipments started coming boatload. guys travel bubble aus.

Also, tell Christians “no, cant church” literally anything else allowed open, theyre gonna pitch hissy fit rebellious loud pissed off. 

Like Im person services—ONCE SAFE. one cares safe situations DeSantis knows butters bread. one fucks mouse coming hear complain know potential consequences taking reasonable precautions going want anyway?  Mister Ed pleased. Belgian here, situation pretty decent i'd think.

Most things fully open (except clubs), vaccination % high, hospitalisations slowly rising, calculations say going overwhelm hospitals covid health tracker basically. Interesting. Millennials Zoomers hate tech writing field? Matress company CEO says need fancy mattress sleep better.

OMG conspiracy! Jeebus calling flock home. 

What’s big deal? Narrator: indeed find out. fact Reddit ground zero misinformation

If true, Facebook ground -1000. Around 1% population getting vaccinated every day, there's massive explosion 39s getting Pfizer shot September 1. handled covid well last year, year fucked vaccination drive, finally enough vaccines, right percentage Australians getting vaccinated per day higher ever US UK, looks like we'll overtake US first shot percentages soon (we're currently US managed despite vaccine shortage issues). Thanks lockdown, Aussies trying get vaccinated soon possible, jump hoops get mine. *ACKSHUALLY* clearly understand facetiousness, hyperbole, humor. really depends principal. One district could care less spreading disease others. ""These mutations basically chance try Delta easily spreading unvaccinated""

Lets ease misinformation. Vaccinated likely get delta carry viral load. Vaccinated less likely hospitalized. vaccinated unvaccinated ability petri dishes variant. choosing risk health yourself, class, community ""God given""? i'm assume also pro-choice, anti-death penalty, pro-meth, pro-drunk driving, anti-drivers license, pro-euthanasia, right? right?? Tbh probably never.. it’s going take enormous amount effort try put back box. Even say country became virus free, you’re still relying global population well order fully eliminate chance immune escape variant mutation.

Look way, time takes entire globe reach herd immunity time virus try mutate past present vaccine. Virus’ 1 objective that’s survive truly race virus. longer sit debate masks work take vaccine, worst odds get day passes.

Anyway, shouldn’t say never like said it’s enormous effort needed. Much currently doing. think mixed daily number total numbers. 

In exponential growth, increase proportional total number, they're exponential. matter one look at. Exactly. People like spout whole ""virus tend evolve less lethal"" general, that's true, dead/sick hosts less likely spread it.

That's one things make COVID ""scary"" - easy transmit show symptoms. well could evolve 10x deadly, long still spread week sick, really much slow down.

Note: I'm suggesting that, likely is, rely bit foolish. would require many mutations, spike . . . what? fuck happens flu? need new vaccine every year? 

It's called [antigenic common enough term it. I'm suspicious doc.  need sharpie basically commit crime get Covid vaccine pack ramen?!?!?

I see absolute win. Good luck. seeds? seed might considered alive, yet potential life destroyed. Viruses resemble seeds live cells. certain potential snuffed out, attain autonomous state life.

Viruses don’t carry metabolic processes, don’t cells, simple, inert bundles genetic material, like biological chemicals poisons living beings, seem like chemistry set organism, 'live' borrowing cells real living organisms. classify intestinal flora intelligent brains, although think flora influence behaviour. Viruses nonliving parasites living metabolic systems. Especially Arkansas. Honestly higher thought would be.  Georgia, one 36 year old vaccinated man died last week he's basically symbol people refusing get vaccinated now.  evidence? Citing Hawaii? Mega lol. I'm even sure what's point trying make, island 100% enough? Omg totally got me, can't argue that, must admit superior points. Move sweden, dont care noone dies anymore like insisting living first version Wikipedia says, even bother knowing actually says... almost like everyone forgot viruses work comes covid. GTFO pro-plague sack donkey turds He’s breathing, vent is. Without he’s toast. thoughts prayers won’t beat medical science keeping alive right now. like science behind vaccine would have. Pfizer needs add something vaccine make people intelligent. use seatbelts, wear helmets bicycles/motorbikes? Death still result this!!!

Do use condoms? still get sick /impregnate somebody! Can't use those!

I understand people ass backwards. They're really anti vax, anti mask etc. Apparently, they're pro- Covid.

Especially alternative is....whatever got going on. trying con? sources? know much situation. Mandate vaccine they'll double refuse. Yates say it, need bribe them. potential answer obvious question ""what waiting for?"":

The CDC expected number per million vaccine second doses following:

* Avoided infections
* Avoided hospitalizations
* Avoided ICU admissions
* Caused myocarditis cases. reported range--I'll calculate using lower bound.

When vaccinate males 30, avert average 1533 hospitalizations per myocarditis case. ratio falls 62 (ages 25-29), 12 (ages 18-24), 4 (ages 12-17). reason, females lower myocarditis risk vaccines.

Vaccinating 12 17-year-old boy likely cause reported myocarditis case (56-69 cases per million second doses) avoid ICU visit (71 averted per million second doses). two deaths prevented (per million second doses). child underlying health conditions, expected benefits presumably lower

Across age ranges reported far (i.e. 12), pattern decreasing benefits increasing myocarditis risk moving younger age groups.

FDA authorization vaccines older adults absolute no-brainer, shame waiting December 2020. eventually get age groups balance costs benefits obvious. 

I think need prepared data showing mRNA vaccines deserve EUA healthy under-12s. People treating bureaucratic delay, think (or be) genuine empirical uncertainty behind it. oh....HAHAHAHAHAHHA...😐 Give Dr. Fauci already. You’ve told us need us have. rest either die finally get vaccinated hits close home. amount talking TV Congressional hearings idiot Jim Jordan going change minds. way... normalicy   Almost always.

I'm hoping stay strong, reap rewards spreading viral beliefs, rightly direct rage insurance companies bankrupted spouse got supposedly-nonexistant virus. think people haven’t gotten vaccine going couple free donuts can’t actually serious. Nope really, it’s going affect ways casualties. stand though admit layman’s perspective may bit inflammatory. wanted challenge apologize! Keep nutjob away teaching position.

People like America backwards  really discrimination though. Law, education, marketing, etc. Honestly straight give deadline get fire don't. public health hazard absolutely would illegal do. Won’t send collections possible bankruptcy line? criminal. Lobbying seems like root evils. bribery results richer rich people degrading country. free everywhere? feel like remember paying like 2 dollar charge back march I'm sorry losses. say losses financial toll just...the gift keeps giving. aunt job uncle passed, made whole experience worse. aunt fortunate many expenses, job LPN, hope. I'm sorry mom house, healthcare crisis unconscionable.   Hahaha it’s starting get crazy. Pay health insurance blindly believe TV personality turn politician. Normally would agree you, cumulative, monthly average. percentage would get lower shorten timespan. Seems like decent snapshot asking, ""Of people vaccinated, many gone contract COVID""?  could believe this. I've never seen ICU vent costs, friend recently hospital stay 2 nights. normal room, ICU. bill room, MRI, IV bags, almost 60k. released, looked medications dosage amount, one medication insured would've costed 80k. number may go may require dosages.



Edit: talked friend. dose 15-20k, 4 doses far. require dose indefinitely every 2 months...
Edit 2: numbers numbers uninsured. Luckily insured, getting high risk demographic vaccinate. thank Captain Obvious. symptoms ceased within hour that.

Good hear, thanks update.  he's going declare victory like he's reason surge ended. temporary lockdown

We've never really lockdowns America. I'm working school even kids clearly sick teachers turn blind eye. mention seeing students purposely sharing kleenex get sick get sent home. get students need interaction other, opening schools starting look like mistake... ( live state mask mandates) say anything insurance companies

OP though. one brought doctors nurses it. OP saying insurance companies cover cost. Oh saying body fat percentage.   ha. sarcasm doesn’t translate well reddit. i’m opposed stretch imagination. 

this shitpost commentary Q antivaxx culture armed forces. forcing willing go home cause won’t get vaxed don’t want 5g nanobots good thing. think found specific booster delta compared original shot much different increasing efficacy. know still trials using delta booster though know actual results bit Among them, collapsing fit coughing.  Good points. also could spent last 18 months installing HEPA filtration better airflow classes. Invested online learning crap. Instead nothing sacrificing entire generation. Source?

I know many animal reservoirs this. conclude it’s prevalent pathogens? studied common cold amongst animals? looking argument, want know data supports this. Thanks.  guess meant testing, meant like widespread testing reporting moving flu model need medical treatment (including getting prescriptions recovering home) get tested doctor. like get tested see covid need quarantine go quarantine home, needing type medical intervention.  next time? next time?

Why want keep getting sick? difference obesity contagious. One person obese endanger rest community. idea come would apply jogger running alone? Nothing I’ve seen suggests that. explicitly crowded outdoor settings.

Who suggesting masks needed lone joggers? Well won’t happen. anti-vaccine crowd won’t moved anything. winter terrible! spelled fall 21 wrong There's also Milan, Ohio. Pronounced my-lan  Canada, Belgium, Iceland, Denmark, Chile, Uruguay higher vaccination rates point. looking countries 70% + vaccination rates, Isreal. There's lot speculation covid vascular disease, respiratory. also Indiana; ""ver sales"" story written clearly, think jail time making bomb threats. coughing incident happened year unrelated (although probably figured jail sentence). must sort conspiracy unvaccinated!!! This! I’ve saying too. touted vaccination success 60% vaccination gonna get there. Delta may need 90% people form immunity. believe main campaign contributor stock Regeneron, yeah, it’s going fatten Presidential campaign war chest. think it’s highly county specific. Parent 5 year old kindergarten. Yep, that’s feel right now. 

We kept daughter home last year due Covid. longer luxury, pandemic bad ever (and get horrifically worse winter). think Russian book Jesus comes back Christian leaders want kill he’s going ruin racket. country health department Santa Clara, Ca episode Curb link:

“We also unable estimate attack rates available data, meaning comparison rates transmission settings impossible achieve.”

It doesn’t seem like article proves think does.   New Zealand. There’s lot overlap Disney vacationers humans children. True, flu see perfectly healthy 30 year olds ending double lung transplants dead flu. need better covid damn unpredictable. Better protection. Better treatments. 18 months ago China denied Covid existed. 

Now China one still cares stopping it. 

It makes really depressed rest world seems shrug shoulders tens thousands people die every week. 

Please get vaccinated, wear face mask, avoid travel lockdown cities covid cases. born Utah (lots family still there) grew Nevada- I’m you. Utah fantastic medical system… don’t think people realize horrendous Nevada’s is.

It’s actually better Nevada decade ago, says lot. wouldn’t ever want emergency Nevada it’s big part wouldn’t want move back.

Utah also younger population low obesity rate. helps well, even higher cases, cases less likely serious.

Covid spread rampant Utah last winter though, school starting I’m worried Utah going see lot deaths time around. Especially wildfire smoke combined inversion valley.   can't expect good control then? Gonna bleak winter. wait, FDA approval meaningless 
 people genuinely believe Dr.Fauci leprechaun created AIDS? Wow. I'm fucking shocked. /S also handle mental health, different beast still takes staff address.  kid last third K person, mandatory masks. kids wore masks like fucking *champs*. Showing cool designs, complimenting strangers' masks. polite bunch around, expect great things generation. really age containg source, i.e. coughing, sneezing, talking spewing spit. mask use far perfect every kid masked could see may stop spread covid. all, means, plus mitigation measures (ventilation, social distancing, etc) makes less germfest normally is. public health standpoint it’s insane. Removing tool belt need ridiculous.

Definitely mandate vaccines, though. it’s much better nothing, one dose doesn’t protect well hospitalization seniors. Partial vaccination efficacy substantially lower, 65 older partially vaccinated 64% less likely hospitalized COVID-19 people help, stuck loop  NRA want bad publicity conference super spreader event. 

Also, know factor NRA, price liability insurance public events spiking again, especially cities without mask mandates. thread, someone pointed Covid vaccine shield. sword. 

It supplies immune system weapon fend virus, two problems: Something needs wield sword (i.e. immune system needs work), still overwhelmed many invaders (i.e. high viral load exposure).

So unfortunately, old sick people, much vaccine do, especially initial virus exposure high prolonged.

I sorry loss. 

Vaccination still best weapon virus. even politburo would've attempted large scale all-encompassing operation, politburo *lot* crap ""crowded outdoor activities"" way lone jogger nothing wide open space hundreds feet. outdoor sporting event concert, least see logical sense suggesting it, drunken participants yelling standing shoulder-to-shoulder, blanket outdoor mandate (to include lone jogger example) not, way, based real world scenarios, science, statistics. matters amount exposure whether vaccinated. vaccinated heavily exposed delta variant likely test positive (like eat restaurant go church half people COVID positive around hour indoors). positivity rate area stays 5% large majority vaccinated lot less likely get symptomatic COVID even delta variant going around. dare go area positivity rate 20% act like I'm bulletproof I'm vaccinated. I'd act I'm vaccinated take precautions earlier pandemic (like avoiding indoor groups much possible). numbers based anything pull thin air?

WTF no? look data every claim make. Excuse you.

I think particularly controversial, include source - anyone actually even PEEKED data, clear vast, vast, vast, vast, vast majority dying unvaccinated point. going lower bound though (though apparently, actual lower bound around .1%, .2%), possible number getting COVID higher - words ""it might low .2% (though actuality, based CDC data, might low .1%). multiplied death rate around 1%.

I used article, gives lower bound .2% upper bound 6% (which need multiply 1% death rate COVID get % chance vaccinated person dies COVID, .2% dependent article (which states CDC data indicates around said vaccinated weren’t dying. true.""

No didn't, said technically true, misleading, is.

By accounts, around 1500 vaccinated people US died COVID total, since vaccination began.

In contrast, 1,700 people died COVID US August 19th.

So have, one day, COVID deaths US vaccinated deaths US December.

So yeah, vaccinated people die COVID.

But 9 months deaths even equal ONE DAY normal COVID deaths among unvaccinated sometimes. Hurricane, Utah. Pronounced Her-ah-kun. locals correct fucking day. Phil Valentine POS get concern, really realistic expect we’re going data long hauler vaccinated people close vaccine soon delta variant dominant US? guess depending definition “long haul” Press X Doubt. Sounds like problem supporting states schools don’t want right things… [this 95 10,926 worldwide instances transmission classified outdoors.  Mandate vaccines , masks. Punitive measures vaccinated pointless cause anger pushback. We’re ones filling hospitals. 

The fact even bringing cancelling outdoor events insane. Zero COVID never going happen. big think China I'm aware that. I'm sure also aware much America different NYC might well another planet. get vaccinated scum deserve help. treating vaccinated point. less yeah. Peace I'd take deal I'm big fan ramen vaccines, I'm tough customer there. absolutely getting cut owns stock company charges 1250 treatment rather getting free Vax. Look up. Get vaxxed free ffs Ok, next time get COVID? Lol idiots *Preface: I’m pro-vax get booster soon it’s recommended/available!*

Anyone 3rd dose booster shot yet?? Curious hear symptoms felt after.. low symptoms pfizer round 1 felt like hit truck pfizer round 2. curious expect time comes around again!!

Hope safe, happy, good day! Screw opt weekly testing nonsense. Go go home. medical concerns exempt. nothing accurate saying everything know coronaviruses pandemic suggest asymptomatic spread would prevalent. essentially thing saying know everything research two viruses make blanket statement coronaviruses

Where's blanket statement?

Everything know certain point =/= know everything. Natural vaccine immunity. I’ve explosive diarrhea worse covid. keep rockin superiority complex vaccine lol lot fully vaccinated people going Mormon too. Salt Lake huge gay population (and otherwise liberal people.) represent large amount people getting vaccinated.

There entire church wards unvaccinated adamantly vaccine. Especially get 30 minutes outside Salt Lake. Thank you. article doesn’t seem actually add anything new. war christmas, 100 years later  Hong Kong also still zero covid strategy. still impossible travel unless resident. even need vaccinated stay quarantine hotel. Don’t forget missed weddings funerals. Also incredibly heartbreaking exact!

They celebrated, stopped (try pay vaccine) re-opened 60%. Many countries higher vaccination uptake still keep NPIs continue push vaccinations. words, greater percentage vaccinated people live Alabama. Pretty funny reply got hit auto mod. Vaccine cheerleaders need stop contributing covid misinformation. Thank you! good know!  Donald Mcneil Jr! dude hold back said shit going hit fan. time driving podcast stuck day. That's spent sounds exactly like experience finally got ""they shipped"" email today. VIDA? science-based organization.

It always mistake science-based groups try play politics. need review Pfizer data rapidly get EUA kids whose parents want them, rapidly Pfizer applies late next month. ....does it? depend parent? I'm confused right now. I'm saying anyone necessarily ""forced"" anything *most* kids, hit certain age, object poked doctor - begin get say?!! school requiring everyone vaccinated starting November 1 want enroll spring classes :) feel safe since everyone wearing masks get vaccinated able attend!

and no, mean hate black people, whatever bizzare shit got accused last time said was... unvaccinated people that's probably minute amount.  think whole picture Although immunologic benefit cited researchers relates protection diarrheal diseases especially prevalent developing countries,2,3 breastfeeding also shown protect infants extraintestinal infections, otitis media4–6 respiratory evidence animal studies work suggest cells breast milk survive passage intant's digestive tract, taken gut mucosa, found draining lymph nodes.3,24–26 Evidence cells remain functional comes observation positive skin responses injection mycobacterial-purified protein derivative transferred one individual another breast milk. I’m saying vaccination definitely end solution (how get past this) takes 4 weeks unvaccinated person gain meaningful protection Delta that’s going help short term problem Oregon’s rapid increase cases. Restrictions mask mandates help flatten curve quickly. It’s temporary band aid quickest acting one. 

I think issue is, restrictions working, public health officials seem forget it’s temporary drastic measure lose focus vaccination long term efforts. really triple entendre use word 3 times, distinct meaning. double (or triple) entendre saying multiple meanings, there's one meaning here.  conservatives designed way privatise keep NHS free point service. key words “free point service”. means, citizens never pay it, however, they’re using taxes. privatising they’re keeping “free” time spending exorbitant amounts unnecessary private treatment.

Eg they’ll sell hospital, ran privately profit, tax subsidies pay everything. still appears free, it’s costing taxpayer 3-4x amount prior. drugs agreed buy US left EU. cases cost 10x amount get elsewhere, it’s still free person, company’s probably giving PM comfy backhander. 

We also private healthcare, imagine pay better, poach best doctors services etc two-tier healthcare system. rich get best, isn’t stopping fucking tax payer NHS lmao. But, must stress adore NHS. Without it, sister wouldn’t here, we’d probably millions debt thanks surgeries. companies this. Insurance companies raise premiums like they’ve done smokers Lmao. mighty thank you, kind human.  first, sorry dad.

im trying understand setup. mother's responsibility nothing? wife need go back lawyer specifically certain words clauses responsibility part?

fyi...also md. remember couple weeks ago people saying boomers vaccinated Sturgis problem.

That age well. amusing  Next step don’t support Covid treatments unvaccinated.

Cool. stop there? Let’s refuse treat people obesity too. all, that’s choice too. Let’s also refuse treat car accident victims didn’t wear seat belt. choice. People don’t cross cross walks, people committed crimes. free medical system refuse treat people things don’t agree with! 

You know what? Let’s refuse care republicans. That’ll teach ‘em! line slowing down, hence infection rates dropping.  That's Covid toilet paper hoarders waiting for. Wouldn’t easier schedule people unvaccinated give less shifts? don’t agree policy two pronged approach would good Gave upvote +69.

Except work home.  depends state live in, people keep responding contradictory information. US states, part correct. debtor would estate deceased. technicalities course large parts couple’s joint assets bypass estate entirely become fully property surviving spouse. community property states, however, debts deceased accrued marriage conveyed surviving spouse obligated repay joint assets. answer just... get vaccinated? What? Obviously want shitty pharma companies profiting pandemic really see alternative is. Things need start happening convince people get vaccinated, every company starting charging extra $200/month unvaccinated employees, it. Don’t spread kind fear. homestead totally protected this. whole saga taught easy turn people sociopaths. find group hate. aren’t going stop spread. It’s feasible. encourage vaccine, expand medical capacity, return normal life per comfort level. 

If want avoid crowds wear mask, so. idea obtainable goal allow us move ridiculous. going reach zero covid. ‘getting past this.’ Average house state north $500k , no. Ya, kid NICU week paid total $70. We’re fortunate good health insurance vast majority people US, isn’t case. Best luck India. already do. insurance mandates health screening blood work lose $1,000. stick goals meet that's another $600 things like smoking (already HUGE addition) losing weight, sticking diet, exercising, going PT issues, drinking often etc. hell been? damn near industry wide. causes death also higher much older republican demo. chance 2024, none 2028 lost 20 million (not necessarily voters, enough put presidency permanently without huge policy shift party.) gonna dumb, gotta tough..

I guess. Found thank Tax benefits. Especially one die. Properly structured, pass stock, real estate, etc. person 0 taxes. fact, even cause base value stock rise time death. So, bought stock $1 $1000, selling would mean pay capital gains $999. But, buy stock $1 rises $1000 die, spouse receive stock starting value set $1000. sell stock $1050 pay capital gains $50. sell $1000 pay taxes all.

Also bunch legal issues come various situations married. obese well? Obesity surely costs lot, possibly covid.  unvaccinated doesnt mean risk either.

Check percentage unvaccinated vs. vaccinated getting admitted hospitals see insurance would care this. There's high correlation can't believe people still asking questions like could antibodies already, correct?

Sure definitely could.

That mean avoid exposed virus.  means avoid regular risks like car accidents, heart attacks, falling ladders.

It's matter risk management. variants we’ve seen far came developing countries much lower vaccine availability, worry given sheer amount vaccine hesitancy US, spread potential future variants *facilitated* US illegal ACA individual small group insurance (except smoking). group insurance illegal raise rates unvaccinated HIPAA, give 30% vaccination discount. Land free, hospital debt. highly suspicious information mixed doses way effective double mRNA - far I've seen one source that, questionable statistics place. Looks good true. 

I know looked at, comprehensive study conducted heterologous dosing, reaffirms studies (CombivacS, several German studies) concluded more-or-less thing. [South Korea's breakthrough cases vaccine really bares well.

[Relevant data AZ+Pfizer, even 28 dosing interval, generates ~91% anti-spike IgG volume Pfizer+Pfizer, 230% greater cellular ""several months"" pretty much would take implement vaccination passport 

Then good thing already using things. end week, they'll required venues activities. case I'm going need someone inject hot throbbing meat heard pandemic government call increased doctors, nurses, medical staff? heard anyone suggest expand resident slots, fast track programs, revise training, start training emergency staff, offer scholarships, anything increase supply medical beds?

They're stealing billions you. disagree; send *cowards* home. I’m sure I’m misinterpreting you’re saying definitely minding vaccination else it’s actually get past this… email Tuesday, South Dakota Department Health spokesperson, Daniel Bucheli, said spikes Covid cases state ""are following national trend experienced every state.""

cough, cough Mister Ed got goddamned vaccine, he's dumb horse. rather amusing two separate debates time. anyway, think probably agree disagree. personally fear happens open door prioritising right life (treatment). get point might 'fair' people facing consequence actions eyes, definitely black white argument. end day politicians want sorts discussions think need bloody careful blindly pass red line can't uncross. Things like set presidents future. anti vax crowd keeps looking reverse masks protect vaccinated they’re ones ending hospitals. numbers two days ago 95% people hospitalized area unvaccinated. even tested positive you’re looking .15% overall hospitalization rate past week. would appear even low mask rates vaccinations certainly working. southern states low vaccination rates like 5 times many case northeast.

And then, spoiler alert, end video says get vaccine ""I've read bad stuff it, change thinking study."" \[Do think vaccinated could stopped here? ""Not time believe that."" !&lt;

Unreal. Put plainly: everybody needs vax. Everybody. Simple that. agree, especially vaccines COVID 19 give blood clots, sure you’ll survive COVID 19 fucking die, health costs blood clots? blood clots lead strokes, heart attacks, etc. money going coming pocket, already strapped cash pocket mean. healthcare universal free citizens think citizens would get vaccine. rate increase also dropping earliest hit areas like Florida. They're probably able write charity something fucked like that. ""Helped poor person, 1M write hospital profits"" wonder, communism, socialism, libs? feel like I'm gonna start correcting people saying diabetes type. Type 2 Diabetes fat people. Type 1 diabetes autoimmune like lupus. start paying extra premiums insurance top ridiculous insulin copays I'm going lose shit. right, thanks People need look HMOs. system f'ed solution working towards single payer, need see HMO works you.

HMOs cap ""max pocket.""  2021 $8,550 individual $17,100 family. HMO max pocket $1000 per individual $2000 family. possibly pay year $2000. Deductibles, office visits, open heart surgery, ventilator, insulin, prescription drugs, emergency room visits, ambulance, whatever. matter happens can't pay $2000/year.

And cadillac rich-ass person plan. work small company offers typical insurance plan (a PPO) HMO. HMO slightly cheaper PPO.

What downsides? jump hoops. need specify ""Primary Care Physician"" a.k.a. family doctor. time need go specialist, he/she refer you. That's dead simple though. careful ""out network"" shit, cover that. search doctors insurance provider's website call make sure covered. live, take back bend trash bad upcoming market crash ruin firms like lol. local population small, local hospitals also proportionately small. local hospitals fill up, people go farther farther care. 

People went back home Sturgis got infected filling regional hospitals too, so… Let's face it, upset property destruction loss life. hospital? it? GOOD Obese smokers die sooner poeple live healthy lives.  Taking care elderly cost dead person. Maybe obese pay less! Good stuff! want anyone punished refusing take vaccine even though could. Yeah, Youyang Gu great thread likely reach herd immunity back Feb, mentioned delay vaccinating children one largest  guess wants press getting ass sued. right - still fossil fuel loving idiot control.

I hope party get voted next election.

It public health disaster open 70% adult population vaccinated.

The hospitals strain bad flu season.
I shudder think health outcomes 300-400 extra people needing hospitals per day flow percentages needing intensive care.

I got vaccinated soon could got son vaccinated yesterday. 
Due slow vaccine take roll lot people 20’s 30’s getting first vaccinations.

The NSW government given access extra vaccine supplies due badly managed outbreak.

The current government NSW Federally dumb enough try save reputations try force rest country open 70% adult population full vaccination course. 

They won’t allow extra weeks need build full immunity due large population Sydney NSW claim 70% vaccine rates large parts Australian population outside NSW city centres remain unvaccinated.

People living land remote areas going die much larger numbers due lack timely medical care. That's horse dewormer pills talking, need get them. People able laugh one thing hating separate thing. ban doesn’t apply US Citizens green card holders. neither, enter, need present negative test within 72 hrs travel even vaccinated. human-rights abusing jacka\*\*es. Here’s another moronic position: eat ass  barbaric rest capitalistic healthcare system. 


Exactly. actual liberal would disgusted using cudgel. 

But left leaning authoritarians call liberal it. say transmitted easy not. However 40% White tail deer believe 500 covid 19 antibodies, imagine jumps species think it’s possible all? literally never happened. Sure eradicated diseases, that’s thing stopping current acute pandemic. pandemic phase point.  Neither poor diet, leading cause obesity, heart disease, diabetes stroke epidemics west.

If that’s enough, [recent showed plant based diet cuts odds moderate severe COVID 19 outcomes 60% compared standard American diet. low-carb diet faired worst, know it’s sugar. still consider unhealthy diets “pre-existing conditions”? employed place cuts insurance rates employees things smoking/nicotine use. anything new. vaccines train body’s immune system respond virus hasn’t seen before. people experienced form flu virus. speculating, may haven’t side effects flu vaccines. Still media focus side effects may affect people’s judgment whether side effects happened vaccine happened feel shitty time. mild aches pains shots, get mild aches pains lot, can’t sure vaccine caused them. 

Plus, got shingles vaccine earlier year side effects two days sick bed highest fever ages. Still, much better getting shingles. Oddly zero effects second shot got six months later. ...yet next big mid-west wave begun. barbaric rest capitalistic healthcare system. simple fact individuals hospitalized due Covid cost insurance companies not. insurance company recouping added risk.

I wonder fare court. never will. Ugh. want hoverboard. that's way things work.

Vaccines work training body create antibodies protect particular virus.

When exposed virus, starts multiply. **You infected.** way prevent happening, unless figure way live without ACE2 receptors cells.

Fortunately, vaccinated, memory cells immune system recognize SARS-CoV-2 spike protein dump antibodies. antibodies bind *infected cells*, marking destruction. Then, immune system's cells come kill infected cells, preventing virus replicating. Eventually, infected cells killed. immune response fast strong enough, experience disease (COVID-19).

But order get immune response, *have* infected.  Personal experience add this. article confirms thought antibodies vaccinated, breastfeeding mom's milk. article says know babies getting antibodies system yet going GI tract. (we drink vaccine get vaccinated)

Last week, tested 19 month son breastfeeding mother fully vaccinated 3 months. blood test tested negative antibodies. disappointed heard similar information study. seems Antibodies transfer him

There still many benefits breastfeed keep feel need anymore fact vaccinated breastfeeding vaccinated mother. worried headline reddit post confuse read study. 

Keep safe approved vaccine. times. sub place depending phase moon such. Medical Medicare actually extremely comprehensive worthwhile coverages poor making less $40k year receiving strong subsidies lower taxes vs overseas.  actually. 

If working one track mind would happy forcing people vaccinate disgusted barbaric means using achieve this. 

Thinking hard sometime, take time need minute replying garbage. mean lie? Because.its definitely lie. 300 cases less Japan yesterday (let sit moment) 6 deaths? Bullshit. Yeah, wearing latex gloves Stihl leather work gloves pump gas! from? mother’s family Crestview. check here? Herd immunity relies sterilizing immunity have. Delta happily walk wall vaccinated people asymptomatically vulnerable. Vaccines might slow prevent paths vulnerable populations need stop pretending herd immunity realistic goal, isn't.

This ends everyone becoming infected vaccinated average individual broad durable immunity case covid another illness. Endemic covid best option moment. Glad see this. friend went sadly passed away Covid complications 60 days ICU. memorial weekend everyone attending asked wear colors OSU memory. LOVED OSU. 
RIP Mark R. great guy, son,brother, dad, husband friend many always hold piece hearts. numbers looking covid deaths vs vaccine deaths? numbers tell you? Alpha think strain United Kingdom memory serves. Aka b1.1.7

Wild type technically og (original gangster kids days say!) strain regards nomenclature, variants get delta naming. elsewhere

I love country without anti-vaxxers. means probably making close $80k year saving $8,000-$9,000 year taxes vs country like Germany full medical coverage. $500 month still basically ahead even full deductible next year would ahead again... This. instance, higher education free Germany. flu right better firing ass getting companies doing? Cheer up, gotta find silver lining. straight admitting literal one-track mind, know that? Random question, sexual aspect lifestyle, blown proportion popular culture? would grunt moronic incoherent position? say you’re trolling contrarian, humiliate yourself. someone texas, help? ban MMR vaccine mandates schools? took long buy vaccines, that's MUCH lot harder Brazil secure 422 million doses (first second dose) Uruguay secure 6 million. money, Brazil can't buy much doses even country wanted, much vaccines available. 

Brazil first offered Pfizer-Biontech vaccines [in August 2020, accepted offer March alone makes huge difference vaccination timeline two countries. Also, infraestructure huge difference. lot harder vaccinate 211 million people spread huge territory like Brazil vaccinate 3 million citizens live small territory almost half people living single city (Montevidéu).

In practice almost impact vaccine delivery, compared factors. taking less week received vaccine lots distributed cities. TOD (transfer death) beneficiary designations houses bypass probate. POD (payable death) beneficiary designation bank account. states, cars bypass probate. probate means private creditors can't collect assets.  sweet corn! 🌽 🌽 would COVID still spread way? logic, air breathe isn’t free, coalesced solar system surrounding planet force gravity cycled ecosystem. point is, breathe outside without paying anyone money.

Oh yea def! example, bcg vaccine, like holy moly knew covered many potential illnesses! initially tb, like studies still done today regards things could protect against! friend fully vaccinated 2 months still caught delta 2 weeks ago. lost sense taste smell overnight, minor congestion fatigue; confirmed test covid 36 hours later. senses started coming back bit around day 5. He’s still testing positive virus though. Great news! Surely insurance companies passing savings back vaccinated people right?

... Right? Diabetes obesity contagious. Tagline: Live Menos give raise money me? can’t even afford health insurance.. 10k max pocket whole family case emergency. Realistically rarely ever hitting co pays set prices. making 100k year saving average $10-12k year taxes vs country like Germany full medical coverage. would rather pay $10,000 year extra taxes matter $10k max case emergency? American healthcare system parasitic corrupt. It’s absolutely disgusting. everyone knows health insurance tied companies shit changed, want change get behind people DO. separate dumbass antivax idiots, aware people multiple paths thought, shut take horse deworming pills. means get booster -2 days ago instead 2 months lol. absolutely this.

I would go little say, noble thing accept small risk order benefit society. gets little murky forcing kid take risk without consent. serious side effects vaccine children, even incredibly rare ones, expect lot parents opt out. Even parents happily got vaccine themselves. Companies Tobacco usage already. Korean tests coming positive soon getting sick found dead/parts virus people still shedding. Obviously reinfections happen, early reports Korea testing errors reinfections—all cultures came negative none infectious. Lol know phones still icu. Nothing makes harder watching idiots die knowing existence killed people too. 

The good thing actions garbage insurance companies conservatives defended much going f*ck them. maneuver delta tip ice berg. Others going use elective procedure exclusions pay care unvaccinated people.  Who? comes suprise all.  longer virus allowed continue wild, variants develop. Sometimes contagious well

Turkey, (like many states US hearing overrun Delta variant), low vaccination rates.  Fuck feelings get goddamn shot.  understand case, particularly blame black community (although specifically mention them.)

At least understanding though, black people disproportionately denied vaccines. people unvaxxed either children, people literally cannot receive vaccine health reasons, *choosing* get it. 

That's bit gets prefer bankrupting unvaccinated you.  catch one strain once? math mentioned article. math breakthrough cases/# fully vaccinated. article states ""Of fully-vaccinated New Yorkers, 0.33% diagnosed coronavirus""

I know that. Read reply. math use trying determine question appear believe question worth pondering: well vaccine protect exposure? 


But math used - breakthrough cases/total vaccinated population/time gives completely different look. tells likelihood vaccinated individual contracting virus period time. representation real risk. real world, people always exposed. again, assume exposure? question want answer ""How likely vaccinated person get COVID NYC?"" number gives pretty good jumping point. Ayds Diet Candies : Hold chocolate going Florida coast next weekend meet vaccinated family members unvaccinated children (under 12). get antibody test go? staying house eating inside restaurants, wearing mask - precautions take?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* still set much pay it. always pay more, going paying less unvaccinated employees. think right reasonable comfort levels risks CoViD need achieved get back normal. also think hold different ideas (at least surface) reasonable, much we, society, currently freaking out.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It would reasonable comfortable risks CoViD faced day 1.

If US made zero efforts flatten curve, would've totally overwhelmed health systems lost least 3,000,000 people end 2020.

IMO, would've sent nation never seen state utter panic chaos could easily gone way civil war (over toilet paper alone).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Regarding overall concern; US Lockdowns generally lasted weeks, happened far often 2020 2021; we're headed right direction. Overall, stringency 'lockdowns' 2021 also reduced; often limited business hours place full-on stay home orders.

Likewise, restrictions sorts, even mask-mandates, lifted (at least temporarily) places US 2021; returning hospitals got overwhelmed various counties, slightly sooner better foresight.

Perhaps dramatically, last year made students learn home whereas we've sent back school year; masks, that's still way better.

The Delta variant made huge dent progress, yet recall full-blown lockdowns happening anywhere US past months.

Overall, society, we're acting far less concern things worse; we're clearly moving right direction, seem alongside rational reasons less concerned (significant vaccination rates, slightly improved therapies, related reductions worst-case scenarios).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Regarding viruses mentioned, even now, time single infection MMR family noticed, health-system immediately reacts quarantines invasive mitigation measures; generally without protest.

By treating viruses caution deserve, able keep old viruses interfering society whole, able live without real fear daily lives; yet still vaccinate nearly every child gets born MMR bundle... without society-wide conspiracies concerns freedoms.

Perhaps importantly, comparing concern vs concern then, 1963 (when population 57% current sizze), 500 people dying per year measles. We're losing least 300 times many people CoViD; so, increased level concern quite rational death rates CoViD come close flu, it'll entirely reasonable treat same. point, it'll still killing least 5,000 times many people currently killed MMR bundle combined.

IMO, people's responses wearing masks far blown proportion people's reaction to, far, deadliest virus hit US century. life insurance payout bypasses probate, creditors can't collect it. icu 1 day 3 hours vent lung surgery cost = +/- 175k. Total hospital bill lung surgery 12 day stay reg bed 535k. amazing insurance paid $0

Edit: COVID related I’m vaccinated bc I’m stupid feel like right freedom.

This problem. feel / believe right. But...if we're strict founding document(s) lists right life, liberty, pursuit happiness - I'd argue thats specific order. Right life transcends others, case right liberty pursuit happiness depriving others right life.

Also, always classes 20, things like 10-12 required specific instruction like ceramics. hold 35 students together matter what, sounds insanely hard manage, I'd never try teach full time.

There's lot teaching, fully acknowledge role easier lot ways. I'm saying even part time role became much handle emotionally came managing pandemic home. students kids, took break teaching. Even teaching adult classes. 

Teachers, especially public school teachers, special breed saints. sharing perspective diminish what's going teachers, rather say even easier, part time teaching role easy burn out.  Dont worry. Texas Florida picking slack spades. Mormons actually tend keep tons canned / jarred food hand. outdoor transmission data delta? 

I spent spring summer visiting grandmother FL, I’m back seems missed window things safely friends, figured least try stuff like golf eat outside weather stays good outdoor transmission isn’t issue. 

I’ve tried finding concrete numbers struggled respect delta  often go together:

Entitled prideful individual establishes GoFundMe make funds lost selfish decisions  Sooo never then? think thinking people know going facing large hospital bills, motivated take free vaccine prevents pay case get infected. Insurance companies want people get vaccinated trying think ways force people so. think pretty soon vaccination status impact insurance premiums.

And course motivation profit. business capitalist system. virus hitting bottom line. want pandemic sooner rather later.

It’s reason Disney making vaccinations compulsory staff soon guests too.

Please confuse trying explain motivation agreeing them. believe profit healthcare, social care elderly care. Gotta pump stocks numbers  mean I'm young vaccine. possible would need ICU bed, chances really low me. continue shocked divisive covid is. Worse, I’m painfully aware exempt that. think time particular ceo, would prudent say something effect : ""we studying evolution virus prepared combat needed"". theres many people think 100% money grab. im looking you, Cole beasley. want laugh time, sad. That’s huge assumption she’s making Like opposite plague inc. Delta variant originated India. 84 million people India live extreme poverty, means access basic human needs. They've going lives entirety pandemic, 3 weeks lockdown death sentence.

Delta transmissible alpha, delta get alpha. matter time became dominant strain.

And next dominant strain, probably come another high-density, high-population country whose citizens can't afford stop working, spread even quickly. on, on, eventually everyone antibodies.

The time eradication passed, COVID stay, need get vaccinated accept getting exposed inevitable. (And hope future variants less harmful.) built process within 95 days day identify variant variant concern

And US can't stop migrants crossing border. 212,000 people caught illegally crossing border *last month* - largest number 20 years. CBP's estimates, least many migrants escaped country.

Then there's economy, also shut 3 weeks. Nothing in, nothing out, supply chains completely disrupted.

Good news, though - 3 weeks later, we're COVID-free fire everything again. takes one sick person sneak start sneezing, time we're right back started. Lockdown, freeze economy, deploy food trucks. Forever.

Or get time machine built kill one tiny little pangolin. Highly solvable. remember, exponential growth. Give weeks 90% even masks. No. 80-90% must **immunity**. We're going get there, cost suffering deaths necessary. Make unvaccinated people wait outside tent Texas wait treated. Far could tell look viruses family get idea could happen. Covid family influenza. 


What understand flu segmented genome means develop new strains reassortment two different flu viruses, includes human, pig, avian influenza viruses. means develop new strains partly escape immunity quickly. single stranded RNA virus Corona easily. 


The thing receptor corona uses infect cells found many different organs vascular systems covid produce systemic infection. Far know influenza always? usually? infects cells respiratory tract. Notable worst flu, one caused 1918 pandemic lethal covid. corona viruses like SARS MERS 10% 35% lethal.

So right need really cautious comparing viruses. teach'er.  exponential growth, day would positive cases day before.

Each numbers listed larger previous. That's literally showing  vaccine immunity falls quickly does, natural immunity quicker. natural immunity likely hold us threshold long enough, especially world wide disease. year ago Melbourne coming lockdown?

We knew lockdown was. Ever since started knew we'd hold till early November. is. magic number.

70-80% goal countries. Higher 80% seems difficult, that's long term plan, 70% puts much community still risk. lot people, like sister, want vaccine, still unable grab it. open people 30s waiting vaccines start dying, well shits fucked. true. Look thread worldnews linking exact article. cesspool. virus loses ability infect die right away. literally cannot spread anyone else can't become prominent There's nowhere near enough vaccines antivaxers matter much yet. long time slow rate production. brother saw living grandparent traveling without swabbing vaccines available. Saw issue actions either. flabbergasting. Unconscionable. Bewildering. Yes, states biggest cities ones open world contain virus. territory 250,000 landmass twice size Texas international Airport could manage. secret!! could manage pull off?  Plus he’d miss Regeneron kickbacks gets treatments give require people virus first clinics set specifically lot people complain misinformation vaccines lot things internet fact Reddit ground zero misinformation. none stop misleading title misleading title. Yet comment controversial thread. 

I got vaccine every get anxiety Pfizer done sinister 'missed' something studies.

It shame humanity cannot trust companies supposed save life find weird reddit even sceptical.

But guess antivaxxers miss information leave room that. makes wonder Pfizer allocated money ""fight misinformation"" way. 

So many questions wait know think global warming wipe us that. That’ll dawg.   don’t think people sports event wear masks? born early 90s GREAT time born. Children first things generally stable nice time child. Yes recession stressful many families (I’m forever changed it), personal level job market fine time graduated college. pandemic easiest us aren’t parents work corporate jobs. last 20 years wild man would want even five years older younger.   God given rights classroom. 
Yeah I'ma stop right there, dick, lady? I'm American. 80% magic number.


You've weeks away getting back normal long now? Yeah delayed trigger approach. difficult pull terms evolution though luckily. hey man, got bills pay  every human selfish. Yall got snake bite juice? TLDR:

*Protection two shots Pfizer decreased 88% one month 74% five six months. AstraZeneca, fall 77% 67% four five months.*  literally said don’t care others. would u/HermanCainsGhost continue explaining benefits vaccinating population care yourself? nothing different opinion. everything opinion selfish one. likely anyway. probably faster anti-vaxxers, scientist fully expect vaccine resistant variant. think Pfizer ready produce another vaccine quickly. No. really. Losing ability infect clear distinction. Highly infectious barely effect cold is. professional actors, stay character matter what! know better would thought real deal. legal CEOs make much!?! even do???  You’re mind think it’s easier force people aren’t vaccinated wear masks get take vaccine actually actively protect them.

Masks didn’t control pandemic before, aren’t going now. can’t enforce them, enough people wear voluntarily. way vaccinations localized herd immunity. option  Arkansawers Arkansans goal post moving? policy Australia always - would spend 2021 trying get population 80% vaccination rate soon possible, get rid lockdowns, might keep masks indoors that's it. then, states planning snap lockdowns, working perfectly fine (see Perth, Darwin, Adelaide, Brisbane (twice), Melbourne, even across pond Auckland). one states, NSW, thought snap lockdowns necessary, thanks we're third wave. 

The overall strategy trying get 80% never changed (even slower hoped thanks ScoMo dropping ball vaccine rollout), go extended lockdown try suppress virus (Melbourne might still manage get there), try limit damage vaccine target reached. 

We trying get Zero Covid forever, we've always known zero covid temporary thing, goal zero covid 80% vaccination rates. Unfortunately NSW failed (and maybe Victoria, we'll see), stay lockdown limit damage keep rest country open. shouldn’t teacher. New York, still started enforcing masks vaccinated people doesnt anything spread Delta still get covid easy. soon even 100% vaccinated current vaccines sadly effective. thread actually interesting informative. much rather see facts presented read bunch conspiracy mess discrediting great medical professionals scientists trying stay ahead virus get control. politically motivated experts unreliable regardless distinctions Right feel death rate COVID big enough change minds. 3% death rate means 97% idiots eventually survive keep talking bs rest lives. Awww, New Zealand, well!

Hope get control people showing types sentiments made mop local COVID wards rag   freedom gazillion percent!! kind report put smile Antivax people... feel REALLY bad current students forced study remotely. US around world.

I sincerely hope get thing control sooner rather later.

There silver lining though. Many working remotely etc. figuring actually want lives there's definite change work culture general. 

And course minimum wage debate especially US. 

Just hot take (if that's correct phrase) sitting toilet browsing Reddit. lie say 95 days? April January like twice that. imagine partying fun without testing quarantines shutdowns. feel really fucking bad college kids right now. aren’t. They’re easy get commissary (as long money) easy trade already. haven’t prison, I’ve jail lot. wouldn’t incentive. It’s traded thing already.  there's one person think completely invaluable opinion, dumbo need effective treatments. wish discussion news every night. watched video today someone whose opinion vaccine problem, treatment protocol problem. Doctors used administering IV vitamin C, D, Zinc help body heal. Hopefully last spike final big one then. lot us (like me) going vaccine + natural immunity. last paragraph nonsense - computing resulting R value, required vaccination rate.

The correct values reach R=1 92.6% 98.0% (with VE=90% 85% respectively, R0=6 - numbers). 90% vaccinated, VE=90% R0 resulting R 1.14 thus exponential growth range.

R = * R0 susceptible population = 1 - v * yields vaccination rate v = (1 - R/R0) / telling truth? mean delta wrecked havoc since April year, talk booster talk delta specific variant. mRNA vaccines cause body grow spikes coronavirus immune system detects intruder teaches immune system detect kill. spikes change much immune system may trouble detecting/killing. modify vaccines change spikes body creates teach immune system detect/kill new variant. people still going cruises? Eh... skip ahead ""shrimp ok"" ""rapists buy way wife"" sections later book.  We'll call uneven moral landscape. worst thing experienced result pandemic, count lucky instead sad it. mechanism action vaccine, basically priming body's immune system fight future infections. absolutely right ability inoculate population effect ""herd immunity"" tenuous best, given waning efficacy Delta. better think prophylactic like annual flu shot. prevents getting hospitalized (or worse). Otoh Regeneron antibody treatment indeed true therapeutic given get infected. quite effective given immediately. patients wait breathing issues hit miss. ultimate virus would super infectious one takes like 6 months develop symptoms already infected bunch people die It’s actually pretty good! one kid whole school one neighboring school. week roll dice. study demonstrating that? ever get 70% vaccinated much less 90% vaccinated. second fuck Deloitte paying people little.  don’t think it’s appropriate extrapolate global level - don’t need give every single person two doses newest version vaccine. Original vaccines provide immunity. whatever used, date would helpful make nationwide policy increase amount ~$3,000. Even wackiest anti-vaxxers would fold kind money. data read average age 82 fully vaccinated died. saying agree, Texan small school district, complicated ""they want to"". Last year school district hard time remote option picking folder papers Monday returning Friday.

Sorry, really want tell me, lot families / teacher PC / tablett / phone all?

Because use zoom 40 minutes free that's long enough least online teaching. I've learned world would better without ""god"" fellow. Less wars, less excuses accountability man.  Make sure vote upcoming recall election. quite possible one person might replace current governor California 25% vote despite possibly 49.99% voters rejecting recall. Adopt yourself. got booster cvs partner walgreens. 6 months

Immuno 3rd shots given honor system.  Lol realize many fucking kids fundie morons have? may impact third people develop long COVID, many active individuals can't walk 100 yards,"" Chilton said. ""The question investigating is: enzyme still relatively high active, could responsible part long COVID outcomes we're seeing?”    going happen saying went Mexico group 8 people. 4 us (all vaxed) caught Delta. took instant at-home tests government data. breakthrough rate may much higher people realize. Symptoms mild though, guess vaccine + natural immunity, that's kind cool. happening ever state ;) Yet governor California facing bogus recall election. Here's messed is. majority voters support recall person gets elected one votes field replacement candidates. There's well dozen sitting governor listed field. quite possible one person might replace governor California 25% vote despite possibly 49.99% voters rejecting recall. mention California gubernatorial election next year! could give $100 stimulus anyone provide proof vaccination. would effectively make everyone eligible Love Americans think whole world like 😒

We literally weeks away 80% vaccine coverage. try contain wave get there, open up. either thousands unnecessarily die. course come country half million died, that's probably problem notice amount vaccinated required herd immunity going too? 

Not mention, several experts admitted herd immunity vaccines impossible, many vaccinated still carry spread virus. end 2024 get trump back Australia turned totalitarian state cool make booster 95 days taking January? get current formula works OK delta presumably delta/lambda dedicated vaccine would work even better today’s environment. Ad agencies always like see copywriters, proofreaders editors, plus anyone works account side would likely benefit since clear written verbal communication key role well. Viruses don’t goals. ones exist successfully replicated, that’s it. There’s goal kill host. super infectious deadly virus could mutate wipe host. aren’t trying wipe host. aren’t even really trying replicate. exist *because* they’ve replicated. 

Noting successful viruses don’t completely decimate host observational hindsight. Places like India never unfuck issue. can't, there's way logistically it. slums size chicago... Well, antivaxxers die out, eventually we'll reach 80% vaxxed understand NZ strategy. never claimed forever zero cases. strategy accepts outbreaks happen, leaks MIQ. Everyone expects it, everyone accepts govt transparent that. I'm teacher, principal regularly reminds us take laptops home case lockdown happens. need reminding months totally normal life pass between. prepared again. 

The NZ strategy zero tolerance cases escape quarantine, going straight strict lockdown. people trust govt worked 3 times before, people follow rules. seen failure, seen another chance part. Honestly kind patriotic thing, there's level national pride it. bet it. reinfected natural antibodies much protect that.


So we're held hostage unvaccinated. Yes, lot people area dial available (there's lot farms, etc). Hell, even new house neighborhood use cell phone Hotspot first year built. 

They actually record classes people like us broadband, though, rest tge online experience joke. yet - delta variant vaccine. Exactly, strain without mutation would simply continue replicate see logic behind OP statement. IIRC Kroger $25, sure still  Yeah hypocrite like saying virus exist also getting vaccinated IIRC Kroger $25.  Hey, you’re comment contained one set facts one set opinions. suggested downvoted opinion rather facts. Get stupid?  doubt covid back Jan. 2020. first case diagnosed Colorado March. course virus likely present state that, point spreading. said took antibody test, that's knew got covid Jan. 2020. said get vaccine already covid. suspect get vaccine reasons, made ""I got covid before"" excuse come antivaxxer idiot. I'm glad survived recovering, feel he's completely truthful. instance, Florida passed big ""anti big tech"" law exempted ""company owns operates theme park entertainment complex"" - without exemption, Disney+ could face fines/investigations law, could quite costly.

This particular law much threat already stopped injunction courts, IANAL [judge's seems suggest state much chance winning. Same, literally made comment able know ever infected. Guess can. goal posts move again…. Sigh. miss old life  glad got 2020 vaccine 2023 model looks nice thought hear autopilot better Tesla already exists -- HIV. Thankfully, treatable now, people spread asymptomatic months years.  thought natural immunity lasted around six months-ish? cant wait. Hopefully society collapse time put end bullshit good.    now. There's chance get 90 percent vaccinated rate outside urban centers. going thing long time. always wonder asymptomatically infected (or infection January 2020 COVID - sick WEEKS).

~~Sadly, get antibodies tested vaccination~~

The million dollar question people feel safe enough resume life (of course getting jab lowering risk factor) No, facts, backed data cdc. funny much antivaxers alike. &lt; 1% fully vaccinated rate flying packed cargo plane...I think incorrect statement.  Godammit triage considerations taking unvaccinated first likely get severely ill die? fuck? shit always come religion? It’s like Wars around world, they’re fought religion So, I'm wondering. idiots think one dose horse dewormer makes Covid immune realize would take every day? mean what's plan going brains? ""I'ma gonna da libs taking horse paste everyday months. take damn vaccine.""  free, widely available easy way prevent this….oh wait…  Well great well stuck endless cycle waiting new vaccine. Half people getting it. virus infecting half mutates become resistant new vaccine. vaccines cause mutations. mutations random. causes mutations spread. vaccines help lower spread also vaccinated people sick fewer days, less time virus mutate body. Kids 12 represent 17% population. unless vaccines available parents vaccinate high rate, majority end infected develop natural immunity, get 80-90%. means never... freedoms gone, get ready camps, ladies gents. ""really"" know. makes difficult fully vaxxed ppl carry much viral load un-vaxxed, ppl seem communicable right infection, incubation period shorter. Unless someone tested every day hard say they're positive not. best way judge look case load &amp; positivity town/city state. seems high compared regions country, hanging out/socializing basically roll dice. note 30 chances hospitalized infinitesimally small fully vaxxed, financial effects quarantining catch covid. city Texas currently #1 taking Afghanistan refugees. Maybe educate country live go believing things read reddit. Panic worries meantime. 2018: kill you, makes stronger.

2021: kill you, mutates tries again. We’re 800k doses per day, way better million per week employed Republican right work far God-given right. employment comes employer God. Mediocre vaccines would fine WT corona. one contagious serious diseases besides whooping cough measles, actually need good vaccines. I'm going wait change numbers three times. increase mean exponential increase. answered person's question given visuals better explain exponential situation.  amazing, worth remembering bad 90ish days exponential spread be.

That’s also vaccine. testing scaling manufacturing capacity get people.

We REALLY don’t want go there. would vastly beneficial avoid path. demote hurricanes tropical storms? We'd stop much destruction save many lives. Lol.

Yeah virus like plague inc. might well die without host can't replicate.  kind contraceptives. name Good thing dude right truthful every single thing said since day 1. Even got 85%, 15% unvaccinated would probably live areas thus create repositories outbreaks variants Lmao Fauci said pandemic could continue summer ‘21 conservatives berated many states hitting peak rolling deaths infections summer ‘21 dominate everything climate change full hits 10 years. care Corona deaths half world fleeing homelands.  think 90% pretty far fetched

Just curious. living?  passing staff students' families. 

Kicking premises self-defence move behalf everyone premises. often think taking active precautions catching Spanish Flu?  kill everyone don’t think that’s really feasible lethality high means less chance spreading, basically become infectious less lethal perpetuate spreading “survival” Chili lime shrimp

NGL - fave... Good question.

Yes, goal vaccinate everyone eligible end year. always plan.

Why sooner?

Well, achieving ""Covid Zero"" meant able first line Vaccines came available. ordered enough vaccines, parts world *\*cough US, UK\** midst second wave, priority. (also, US England also manufacture vaccines, currently capability) 

Think standard triage - sick, could wait.

We secured supply, could get entire supply immediately. also infrastructure give 4+ million people two doses speed larger populous countries can. made plan skill people, roll main portion programme 5 months. 

So far, received 35% total allotment. used 27% total allotment. average time vaccine gets country arm someone sits week. getting larger shipments vaccine, started July - started ramping programme.

It always intention try immunise everyone Christmas. plan January, still track that. then, maintain elimination strategy, current outbreak change that. saying people need endgame - tried one, Delta ruined that. showed us hard way that, like not, virus decide timeline.

We're impossible situation. People need endgame impossible give one. terrifying. Yes, seriously. understand claim made post replied to? Honestly depending bad delta gets might actually good sane people turn tail move liberal areas people shockingly lost ""faith"" doctors scientists. 

My county 94% people age 12 least one dose. Look carried that. look still missing. people suddenly change mind. even countries like Spain showing enough people vaccinate, measures needed decrease infections. cost antibody tests/does insurance normally cover it?   going pockets across country going fine see cases many states spotted high outbreaks unvaccinated counties lower vaccinated counties. ever considered messaging him? teacher tell would LOVE hear you! Correct. upvoted comment it’s true. pretending government doesn’t care money anymore sudden?

2 days… sheesh, wife gonna kill tell story. XD  nothing won’t Deep South left. Hospitalisations going overwhelm system see picture like India. Sure, sensible person would wear mask that. Again, completely missed point comment. removing risk transmission. one said that. reducing number people transmitting sure though. Thats logical proven statistically. adding clarification comment seem get that. power trippers holdouts. em’ pay pocket premiums shouldn’t go something that’s preventable. uptick vaccinations Texas since delta cases started spike late last month. I'm cautiously optimistic it'll scare people getting protected, getting harder know someone directly affected Covid-19 might convince people bigger threat realized. One cards draw board game Monopoly lets instantly get jail without paying fee. gave card prison guards. work. many it’s durable especially variants. got original strain seem great immunity delta.

For vaccinated immunity modeled reasonable accuracy. wont happen scientists saying strain become resistant would kill virus major change spike protein would happen nullifying coronavirus attacks. guess weren’t quite talking thing. figured they’d done everything human trials June. knew delta bad news India. 

Once they’ve got knowledge it’s good go wouldn’t expect month lead time producing hundreds millions doses monthly. 20% catching virus mean millions dead. Especially south. wonder stage certain people realise killing people political views similar maybe good idea.  Makes sense Yeah first thought well. rest time talking fast make new one resistant variant. Seems planting seed. hard hard days get correct information, everybody's financial political interests always forefront. try listen scientists seem proof yet mutation inevitable.

(between days 3/4 5/6). \*does happen exponential growth situation\*. saw exponential growth, would see increase number new cases - i.e. higher jumps new cases.

I guess possible efficacy might increase mitigating measures taken think kids going back school negates that. 0% take it, so..... could easily mean discharge.  Ah yes, god-given right risk students' health safety. Pretending end spring 2022 also naive. Upstate NY Cay-ro, My-lan, New Leb'nun, Del-High Aythens. like deliberate.

That said... can't teach kids anymore (at least right now) helping kids online school. I'm burnt out. I'm tired. I'm tired managing house (/kitchen), I'm tired helping manage emotions flared isolation/covid fears, get paid enough teaching (even private/part time) toll takes plan/manage/monitor kiddos. think lot teachers feel way - traditionally also ""woman's job"" we're often pushed back home making roles regardless we're working full time not. there's also fact class 25, say average household size 4, essentially exposed 100 peoples germs every day. huge, complex issue.

IIRC it’s vaccines cause variants aren’t preventative, officering opportunities genetic mutation.

Anyone knows talking correct I’m wrong. I’m open understanding challenged. Ugh It’s exponential 

[definition exponential exponential, would 100 cases now. Today daily briefing Secretary General Health said “steady increase, exponential”

The case numbers showing lockdown absolutely needed start seeing reflected lockdown next days. 

In words, nearing peak outbreak. three working vaccines US multiple development. also say need wear mask, back tracked 6 months later? Close enough. Manitoba. Ironically, highest overall vaccination rate country, also home regions absolute lowest. sites Australia New Zealand produce vaccines?

It’s hard believe this. comes basic risk-management. 

It often helpful ask, ""What's worst could happen?""  then, prepare contingency.  happen, preparations wasted.  But, does, glad prepared. Sadly, bar raised teachers properly compensated important job do, find plenty like her. moot point, since that's federal government's job. Arguably selfish behaviour I’ve witnessed time planet.

That's degree idiots get science math hard.

Source: English degree If. Good point. Breezy Point's situation might like Israel, shot's effectiveness appears wane 5 months amid Delta variant. Older people got shots first. need booster shot. mindset, might DNR anyway. want flavors get outside. Chili lime shrimp, southwestern chicken.

Meanwhile safe bet soon pass vaccination level that's kind thing do. Still waiting study link. 

NIH says:
""The new evidence shows protective antibodies generated response mRNA vaccine target broader range SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying “single letter” changes key portion spike protein compared antibodies acquired infection.""

Which opposite statement natural immunity better depend Triage computer algorithm. Doctors nurses make decisions rationing care based real time metrics. Stop looking edge cases trust professionals uphold Hippocratic oath. I’m wondering well, talk shifting 3rd booster dose mix actual delta booster falling wayside   husband there. snickered comment. Serve divorce papers. province Alberta?  place inbred hicks.

Good idea 💡 might introduce needed depth gene pool. problem person acquires natural immunity likely infected variant vaccinated are, also stronger vector (vaccinated individuals breakthrough case recover quickly, so, host virus less time), case - first infection reinfection, represents opportunity virus mutate. 

Given enough chances, virus could mutate form nullifies benefit current vaccines, game begins scratch. 

Even individual regions nations manage get upper hand virus current form, global situation hard control. 

If citizens wealthy nations good isolate, could afford do, could focused vaccination effort nations isolation option compatible survival, lucky, might defeated virus way. Since didn’t happen, think nations get upper hand virus choice close borders prevent spread variants. lacking countries, think roll dice whether survive. 

We lucky faced challenge benefit unprecedented technological resources, even squeak time, failure act cooperatively common good us eventually, don’t make enormous social progress. someone lives Alabama legitimate fear me. extremely paranoid going end getting shot administrator anti-vax syringes full saline.

NSW lock hard fast enough. NT 5 months long time. 150-ish days long time. We've known virus well year now, thats long time. taken steps protect yourself, family, friends, community, country, selfish, delusional, ignorant, lazy, deserve whatever happens you. Michigan alum say I’m pleasantly surprised. could solved easily.

If someone gets sick can't get vaccinated legitimate medical reasons; contract trace non-vaxxer infected them; sue person. 

I believe forcing anyone vaccinated, freedom comes responsibilities. make irresponsible decisions, made responsible negative consequences them.


Also, health insurance companies charge refuse vaccine. pay someone makes bad choice? Health insurance companies charge smokers add insurance claims costs. What's difference? Lmao wait gamma strain come like 20 percent death rate

Couple surveillance done across nation, pretty good idea strains dominate. said, uncommon flu vaccine 30% effective. one reason (among many) covid vaccine impressive. People understand amazing science high efficacy rates new virus like this. Obviously RNA research around long time, extremely grateful vaccines!

Hopefully convoluted answer somewhat answered question :)  Moderna focused B.1.351 back then. Delta considered low escape variant. late April Delta strain considered seriously, even know July going explode rapidly elsewhere. Even started mid-July, we'd still 2 months clinical trails new vaccine would begin. then, could Lambda 617 newest concern. 3 months astoundingly quick able create specific vaccine deciding necessary, without able predict variant going next big thing even 1 month advance, we're going fighting reactively pan-covid vaccine.

The flu vaccine targets 2-4 strains/variants IIRC, get breaks battle flu try make best guesses flus going common probably use data hemisphere fights battle flu half year separated other. comparable covid season many cases, many new variants. flu lot older new variants still fit well-known subtypes (ie: H1N1), lot better knowledge expect flu. even advantages, still struggle getting right years. don’t listen science?

Congrats, Governor Noem ...and could trust fellow Americans, might comforting. 😞 said nothing vaccination status. Definitely, caught covid , thought antibodies built up. Reading though foolish assume would ok caught again. Decided get shot, feel lot better mentally all. Politicians get avoid tough conversations using universal mask mandates look like they’re making effort improve situation. 

Here Chicago, mask mandate cases alone go 400 (in city 3 million, mind you.) impose vaccine mandate like major cities? least vaccinated demographics already underserved preventing non-essential activities would require discussion mayor cowardly have. 

That’s government gets something playing people. Immunity mrna vaccines fades fast. Vaccines really going differ drastically delta regard. woman 30s died Sydney home Covid. Left husband children

Don't think dying good health either NZ much better job world; especially comparison shit show USA (I American). Yeah long still millions morons refuse get vaccinated. 2019 virus needed measures 2020 2021 could project good control 2022 make 2023 primed ready set 2024 precursor 2025’s steps reopening 2026 society 2027 2028 latest.

We got this! comments ridiculous. Nobody preventing double masking. vaccinated, cares. protected becoming ill. know Covid fear mongers don’t want hear though. 

I’m vaccinated myself. trust vaccine protect critical illnesses. Yet, Covid fear junkies love say “Just get vaccinated” reality, vaccinated changes absolutely nothing them. still scared don’t trust data. Lmao  Ton wait see people really hoping responsible people would work getting vaccinated virus would go away. don’t even know niacin get need it. I’m exactly denying importance, rather it’s literally never years mentioned me. wouldn’t exactly call ignorant science.

Does really surprise health mandate policy makers haven’t slightest clue. 

Especially generally hold conservative values(not polarized mudslinging kind) belief things remain same, thus predisposition resist change? Watch Q idiots start taking anitvenom treatment Well file 'Not Surprising All'. impossible goal.


NT massive area small population. 250,000 people live there. even international airport?

NSW different story. Sydney city open world. hundreds flights going place Earth. millions living there.

You're comparing apples oranges.

No one goes NT. Many people go NSW. Literally said last year **Queiroga announces 3rd dose elderly immunosuppressed September Minister Health Marcelo Queiroga announced night Tuesday (24) September 15 applied booster dose vaccine Covid-19 elderly 80 years immunosuppressed people (recently transplanted, cancer, severe burns, etc.) taken second dose vaccine least six months date chosen because, according minister, Ministry Health's calculations, entire population 18 years old already vaccinated least first dose vaccine. immunizer chosen booster dose decision came meeting Tuesday night technicians Ministry Health representatives PAHO (Pan-American Health Queiroga also said decision took account progress application second dose general population.

""We good amount doses Pfizer, Astrezeneca also enough doses. But, minister pointed kind problem Astrazeneca vaccine, since API still comes China, interval remain 12 weeks. lol it’s crazy brains broken mask thing. it’s unbelievable. tiny piece cloth! studies compare side side vaccinated unvaccinated populations long term (greater 6 weeks) respect side effects? convince them.  submission linking google.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Found article (take look come NJ doesnt mask mandate NY ""Save idiocy. Again.""   Charles Darwin died 100 years ago legacy lives fools! We'll get there, either people get vaccinated Covid make sure there's less people get vaccinated. Thank changing mind! think error classify everyone gotten shot yet beyond hope. still plenty people waiting fda approval, time, information, whatever. hear you, willing bet another 200k+ people get first shot tomorrow US. day too. Like, every day week next.  peaceful way. kind way. loving way. tolerant way. way.  Try telling friend. seen since start pandemic. told today caught COVID-19 twice, times laid bed 5 days. asked get vaccine, believe it. \*shrug\* supposed impressed ? link Pfizer’s ceo . unfortunate choir good example 100 percent protected coronavirus, even fully note Statens Serum Institut (SSI), Pfizer vaccine provides 79 percent protection becoming infected Delta variant, contagious variant. vaccine Moderna provides protection 88 exposure
There thus doubt vaccines Danish vaccination program work quite also underlined incidence unvaccinated 353. is, 353 confirmed cases coronavirus per 100,000 fully vaccinated, incidence 41.

IE nothing see here.... 'student', PhD. working virologist. PhD supervisor literally wrote book ('Principles Virology'). facts. Hawaii, we’ve exponential rise case count. 20s day 600 day now. Hospitalizations currently 400 unvaccinated 50 vaccinated. It’s crazy. First glance headline looks bad. want add clarification variant isn’t going resistant vaccines. current one produced alpha variant. course create new vaccine target variant. lol masks months ain't ending perfect citation, maybe try one: ""Early results indicate potency engendered antibodies generally reduced faced new variant strain""

There lot confusion question. said news yesterday. say control yet, getting there, article saying. point antivaxxers we’ll get 85% vaccinated attrition lol country fucked costly test US? many group ended requiring treatment, level?  far tell, article doesn’t mention anyone hospitalised. mention one infected sick others, nothing hospitalisation. US never reach number. Source? admitting process evolution natural selection real thing? I'd call win admit understand biological theory real. I'm assuming thought much repeating bullshit read Facebook though. vaccine get rid Fauci? I'm sick him. Yeah seriously who's making decisions? (HURRY FUCK FDA)

As parent feel part same, although reason takes time young children doubled amount time review data.

It's suspected approval happen mid winter.

As said wish would hurry, hand don't. 12 weeks, reduced 8, average 11. know, years ago whole anti-vax thing seemed like bit joke. always bit sad, could mostly ignore assumption people would smarten soon real outbreak something act like reasonable people. 

That joke stopped funny year half ago, feels like we're transfixed kind horrified fascination people would willingly themselves.

Crazy talk, one would ever seriously disregard kind idea. quite serious. 20 flu got bacterial pneumonia luckily hospital fluids observation. could barely breath cough bad I'd puke. running fever. fucking sucked. took good month feel better.

The flu sucks incredibly health time, eating clean, lifting, running, etc.

The flu kills people, even young people certainly older folks (my aunt died 60 flu).

People clue. think mean eventually people left gained immunity naturally. really like speculation. think you’re right. outbreak America 100,000 deaths. complaining 200 cases. joke literally hot take area march lockdowns happened hope you’re right. I’m clinging onto bit optimism point. God far less honest I'd scam shit heads end, seems easy get chucklefucks throwing money scream republican bullshit. Lollapalooza mandated vaccines negative covid test. long ago enough proof super spreader event. That's nobody pointing fingers anger. Lollapalooza right. Stop framing simply result idiot people choosing remain unvaccinated US. Even mandated 100% compulsory shots here, woke tomorrow got number magically, still volnurable. everyone earth vaccininated, virus continue circulate mutate. held hostage people's choice here, also totally inadequate vaccine production distribution bottlenecks affect global spread coronavirus. asinine thing me. 600k dead 330 mil US. means essentially already killed 0.2% US population. even every single person US infected virus, there's way survival rate 99.9%.  feel like people always looking scientist tell want hear. Pfizer CEO, UK health minister, CDC say virus could mutate evade vaccines, found virologist flyover Canada says we're good!

There strong evidence coronavirus evolve evade T-cell B-cell immunity. mutations luckily taken yet Delta easily spreading unvaccinated, sure let's keep fucking around find happens enough dead natural immunity. go well lol -_- could infect animals (or plants) humans. get diseases humans don’t.

Look happened chestnut trees. 4 billion chestnut trees got fungal disease died US. basically extinct US. chestnut trees icon culture beautiful. subject many songs, street names, food, shade, everything.  Sorry, I'd rather listen virologists CEO Pfizer. Whatever available availability problem. US pick choose probably Moderna. 

Pfizer vs J&amp;J vs Delta questionable. Pfizer efficacy seems wane time doesn’t seem effective Delta. South African testing accurate (which given 400k people be) J&amp;J’s delta numbers largely unchanged variant. Pfizer meanwhile get booster, J&amp;J moment, haven’t gotten vaccine yet would matter time need one anyway.  long enough timeline probably doomed either way.

Eventually humans fuck bad enough block sun destroy water sources hell, mutate a.virus that's actually deadly enough kill us all.

Might well make traffic go away open enough housing everyone wait. would fair. Exactly. wonder much efficacy vaccines trials boosted tested times social distancing mask wearing. Even test group get placebo adhere closely guidelines, fact lot stuff shut down, people around masked up, large gatherings, etc already significantly reduced ability covid spread. 

At least seems vaccines decent preventing hospitalization death.  happen virus never spread well. prior highly infectious strain continue dominate. Really depends are. Japan 48% eligible fully vaccinated started 3 months later US cities enough whole populations seen high percentages 85-90% range getting shots. going take time countries still process. 

But US, yeah doubt going hit 80% think there's already something like small number people resist vaccine  Well, possibly may already mutated one infect people stand reason spread. worry that. concerned infect make people sick. 


The lucky mutation would one mild benign, infectious, similar enough existing strains anti-bodies produces would attack existing strains. would something natural vaccine. Millions would die get point, probably. Georgia game somehow see one coming?

Maybe Georgia fan!

(In seriousness, really sucks people charge going forward something reckless dangerous. I'm sorry.) Spring 2022 ay? LMAO. gonna living cardboard boxes time shits over. current vaccine's like 90% effective it? That's chart local pharmacy shows. virus even necessarily die. Spanish flu ultimately became flue. right, nothing caring people's wellbeing them. Depressing. feel like 2021 version tide pod challenge  couldn’t google? 100%? Perhaps obligation citizenship... Hopefully happen it’s wishful thinking. Could evolve something spreads easily time deadlier.

That’s vaccinations important, even don’t protect 100% infection. Less spread less mutation quicker solution whole mess. ones inside people rather shelves. Moderna seems fairing better right now.    Dr. Noc thumbnail? It’s mostly completely avoidable scenario. county sitting 68% vaxxed heck lot happening (we also high numbers infections early on), many wearing masks, many getting sick. enough people vaxxed numbers drop.  additional reason logistically difficult vaccinate people countries don’t great infrastructure Whistling away fact immunity natural infections vaccines drop significantly within months world remains unvaccinated. US. pull Jacque Straps… strain however wouldn’t become dominant one host pool would decrease lot. way propagate = way become dominant. right, mean include access. choice, think. Glad least data social media sources people use, although they're still bit broad. r/covid19 certainly better facebook due tight moderation focus direct scientific publications, I'm sure parts reddit. Social media useful place find people give context studies done answer questions them, depends community. Yeah, need lose weight, start. vaccines bought us time get ready resistant variants.  See y’all next year. next. Jab term shot commonly used outside US. great questions, right, shouldn't. surely hope need emergency use authorization variants vaccines work now. did? would situation could prevented misinformation. Let's remember whole branches government world-wide anti-vaccine, anti-masks policies.


So again.... try explain new vaccine already doubt current ones.  variant US? Maybe. next one? one after? ever. Unless simultaneously vaccinate global scale.    Oooooh Shirts nuisance feasible long term. Yeah you’re going bad time haven’t realized likely stretch beyond spring 2022. Yes. Cases plateaued falling hot spots.  we're expected learn? 

That lockdowns restrictive measures would learning affect behavior infection / hospitalization / death rates? 

Infections may higher country used to, high vaccination rates counter hospitalizations deaths.

 softened way saying ""giving up""?

Continuing failing strategy worked unwise. old get moderately sick tend die younger people would likely survive. article severe cases get deceptive results don’t detailed breakdown catching covid multiple times? get infected asymptomatic first time around, likely asymptomatic caught again? feel sorry willfully ignorant easily brainwashed. vaccine, won’t need monoclonal antibodies.

That's actually true. Even though vaccines reduce severity virus, still possible get seriously ill [or die delta even ableism blinding this. 


[According vaccine reduces likelihood dying getting seriously ill ~96%, reduces likelihood contracting symptomatic case ~88%.

Why think much harm give monoclonal antibodies people? desire kill people unvaccinated?

DeSantis making money btw, that's debunked conspiracy theory. herd immunity effective, 95% population needs vaccinated. Otherwise wont effective Also originally Tennessee. Vols haven’t long don’t know take L anymore. seriously. wish could say surprised me, doesn’t. Might helpful extreme minority cases exactly point. another 50% kids infected result another 300 deaths. many matters great deal. 99% won’t die. They’ll clog hospitals Take shot! dumb a$$e$ unvaccinated keeping pandemic going. Let vaccinated people try live lives least. question medical priority. Denying medical assistance reason would barbaric we're talking anti-vaxxers getting people killed ignorant asses hogging ICU beds. Or, since money matters, Disney could throw weight De Santis political rivals deal next election. doesn’t make sense. Vaccinated individuals likely survive thus need less resources. Unvaccinated need resources less likely. tunnel never ends 😀.  invest beds staffing instead ok killing people, mean paid enough taxes things.  Tbh I’m pretty appalled anyone would consider withholding treatment folks dying dithered long vaccine didn’t trust risk/benefit equation adults slam dunk, definitely approve thing right away, kind thing. lot nuanced kids 12.

There 1.9 million confirmed covid cases among ages 0-12 US. Among ages 0-14, 257 deaths (they seem publish 0-12 number, slightly lower).

That means that, best case, odds vaccine save 0-12 year old's life 1 7,400. that's assuming every kid caught covid got tested, vaccine 100% effective. reality, we're probably looking like 1 20,000.

So, vaccine completely safe, approved. But, severe side effects, even incredibly rare ones, probably won't. already know vaccine cause myocarditis rare cases. question one balancing causing rare side effects vs preventing rare complications. difficult problem, taking long. agree Cullman wrecks fuck us. supporters biggest reason country mess right now. Anything Fauci says doesn’t say held since ‘moving goal posts’. Well, much moment  made appt pharmacy walk-in?  understanding verbal attestation requirement.  mental gymnastics I've seen fb amaze me. flip numbers ""proof"" vaccines work saying new cases vaccinated people. were, purely hypothetically, planning engineer virus weapon, starting years ahead *exactly kind anti-vaccine stuff that’s going around last years,* would definitely part strategy. Undermining confidence vaccines general countries wanted target would smart move. 

Now, I’m means saying what’s happening, just, conspiracy, would working. guy punctuates. instinct it’s billing error. would call clinic. 189 total patients, 159 (84%) received second dose mRNA vaccine, 30% given antihistamines shot. 159 patients, including 19 experienced anaphylaxis first dose, tolerated second dose without severe complications. Immediate, potentially allergic reactions occurred 32 (20%) patients resolved antihistamine treatment. Median patient age 43 years, 86% dude constantly full shit. I'll believe see it.   This.

I've never afraid vaccines got kind stuff time kid. Yeah guess hospital hospital. get 65 Fultondale get 565 thinking takes hour. area we're lower population density, outdoors parks, etc generally like 1-5% people masks we're also yards apart least. go higher density areas, would say like 75-85% masked sidewalks. good things.  Probably lol disagree. need massive production respirators happen. got worn least save people high transmission situations, we’d see go precipitously. Cloth masks good short periods opening indoor dining idiotic. month people wearing real masks indoors would crush spread vaccines. He's saying shit like year. US? ER?  Blah blah blah old fauci bs.  (2 vs 6 months), FDA wanted trial subjects children 

40k+ adults phase 2/3 Pfizer/biontech 

Originally planned 1k children, FDA asked 3k children midway trial 

(Typical phase 2/3 trial size 300-3k adults across 1-4 years, Mass shooting every couple days: Concern.

Covid: Oooh, we'd better careful.

Take note, antivaxxers: Even NRA thinks Covid dangerous are. common view.  [There strict rules allowing medical treatment enemy deny fellow countrymen similar consideration regardless personal choices would utterly inhumane.  ""It'll help die, also get 100 bucks nice""

""Wow $100!""

""Uh yeah.. also dying part""

""Aha. get money?""  33% 12-15 year olds vaccinated. know several fully vaccinated parents 12-15 year olds waiting vaccinate kids. wonder 5-12 gets approval 12-15yo vaccinated. Would parents able request lower dose 12-15yo?  I'm nursing school. skip year come back - seat guaranteed year enrolled for. shitty freshman year winter bad sophomore year gonna suck too.

Most majors probably relatively normal year considering still pandemic. Nursing, need clinicals hospitals infested COVID. schools shut down, learn injections catheters without going class? Taiwan get praise deserves, especially since managed control COVID without going harsh lockdowns. South Korea, well days due Delta, get much praise utilizing lockdowns either. goes Iceland, country barely talked all! somehow Sweden became no-lockdown poster boy, get it. Feels like never  Covids going around long time even bad... deaths unhealthy people vaccinated fine. Fuck lockdowns.  lot
Just like politicians. fecking douche bag I'm done giving shit ""skeptics"" whatever think.

Also, ""skeptics,"" ""contrarians."" skeptic willing change point view face overwhelming evidence. Yeah. True dream one thing. Actually achieving another. heart believe done head think otherwise, take care everyone careful safe please. remember guy wasn’t lying?… either.  today stop living fear FFS. can't even imagine I'd feel spouse killed mom dad.  Stop blaming idiot others act. idiot told people take vaccine multiple times last 2 years, took himself, told followers take vaccine week again.     
     
There isnt one boogeyman including lifelong idiot democrat (trump). always huge chunk Americans trust government. say ""played,"" implies government getting something this. Sure, wearing mask annoying, governor get ""playing"" people way? Medina, Ohio - named Medina, Saudi Arabia pronounced Me-dine-a. There’s whole lot contradictory studies subject….natural immunity simply disregarded lately disputed top virologists epidemiologists. read article BBC days lot stats go window Delta contagious bypasses vaccine antibodies.... think still applies There’s nifty chart shows risk reduction person age 70 vaxxed drops risk level unvaxxwd 50yo person who’s 50 vaxxed drops risk unvaxxed 20 yo.  Etc lower ages there’s diminishing returns compelling older ages.  It’s pretty clear point herd immunity possible breakthroughs,vaxxed folks transmissions rampant. reduction much viral load spread week infection reduced Hospitalization huge deal , cases relatively mild, perhaps eventually attain herd immunity antibodies developed milder cases  motivated forcing everyone back office, sounds like Deloitte thing do. Repost like every damn hour sub today. Delete this. Yeah don’t believe that’s going happen. appreciate enthusiasm. next two variants going wild cards. Fellow TNF blocker user traveled lot work HBV prevalent areas….. really careful “immune” here. Even immunocompetent individuals, vaccine’s effectiveness monitored around 20 years it’s super clear long memory cell immunity last. Furthermore, breakthrough HBV infections happen, confirmed anti-HBc antibodies well HBV virus PCR, FDA prescribing info says immunocompetent people tends lead transient asymptomatic infection. There’s data patients TNF blockers would do, especially given TNF plays key role mounting overreaction latent chronic viruses like HBV TB. Watch Fox News plays refuse get vaccinated making virus go longer. bunch people want see people die make side look bad. numerous studies /r/covid19 agree this: single dose vaccination sends measurable immune response (mostly antibodies, may try measure cellular response) much higher either vaccination infection alone. Search ""previous"" there.

There are, knowledge, studies looking reverse: measurable immune response I'd say forcing immunized people wear masks indefinitely, chance severe infection miniscule, *is* nefarious. “14 days flatten curve” whatever saying. think randy would try says Much hate shatter collective dream, one ended unexcitingly... exchange happened like 2am, next morning already exploding across social media... went radio silence took off, maybe unenthused see conversation plastered across Takeaway lesson learned post chats long conversations Wtf article Sure… Slutbuster. brazil variant back. don’t know massive difference antibodies relative spike variants change spike make less effective, wane time. actually takes 1 parent agree. ok, guess anecdotal evidence fact. unfortunate fond memories college, one best times best moments countless people's lives. Bro, I'm American know exist watching CFL like twice year lmao nonsense over. We're getting past long time it'll continually make rounds. 

My main concern...the eventual variant(s) develop vaccinated person. bug major issue vaccinated wreak havoc people zero previous exposure. Count it.

I'm sure people fighting ""vaccine"" though. Exposure key eventually moving forward corona shot best way via controlled exposure. Um.... things even remotely normal? Yeah, sure, people back offices little bit, income recovered mostly...

But normal? Masks everywhere, temp checks, (I deliver food) orders people would rather left sitting rain front porch risk seeing another human.

Yeah, normal ain't. something could prevent getting really really sick covid... know human animal transmission found sorts animals US. know mink human transmission possible, [and occurred don’t think true though. someone died direct result reaction vaccine, would heard now. yet seen reports mRNA ones. People dying getting shot coronavirus something else entirely different matter. - 90% chance unvaxxed ones dying COVID states waiving cost fair, yes right, eventually tax payer ends paying it. hope seeing recent data Israel UK worried. - ""every man pure propaganda begin notion defies first couple hundred years american/new world history working together  think CEO Pfizer receiving expert opinion Pfizer's huge team virologists regular basis?

Oh, Reddit -10000 whataboutism  anti-vaxx crowd take common scientific knowledge use confirm biases even more. 

It's exhausting downvoted?? impossible know sure though. model mutations might affect receptor binding etc perfect given huge number potential combinations amino acid sequence spike protein impossible say vaccine resistant mutant emerge

I believe unlikely I'd rather prepare eventuality given many variants popped far, many mutations happening every single day across planet. might unlikely enough time opportunities even unlikely things bound happen eventually Wow good them. beginning Taiwan Korea touted handling crisis, Taiwan zero cases yesterday, second biggest number ever :(  fuck would remote learning illegal!? would thought crazy ass religion would turn people science??

So anyone following Little League World Series? “Bye Felicia”  shame doesn’t matter there’s capacity. thought Birmingham already full. Time triage protocols. unvaxxed choice less likely survive. Means wait.

Harsh? Yeah. supposed sacrifice elderly save economy last time. least unvaxxed sacrifice rest us. sounds familiar engagement party Melbourne cost 350,000 Yes. Bad idea. already Lambda variant even 2 years 1/3 country seemingly willing fight die getting vaccinated. also hoarding vaccine get herd immunity smaller countries still waiting. COVID chance mutating waiting get vaccine antivax, discriminate. think lost COVID won. Gotta agree you. physician, academic, lot writing. best medical student majored English Stanford. wrote science paper, almost edits needed. thing beauty. medical students, smart kids, struggle basic writing skills. Celebration K-8 Osceola County It’s sad. Regeneron approved treat mild moderate cases, also efficacious take within 10 days symptom onset. It’s panacea efficacious severe cases require hospitalization.  still insanely low number skewed numbers early, harsh European surge early 2020. I'd rather take hundred deaths total complete lockdown left people desperate. We've opened completely now, also fine summer without restricted dying. summer traveled around Europe, attended football matches packed stadiums everything pretty much used to. country everything vaccinate much possible keep restrictions bare minimum. 


But sure, keep telling Australia good job. Everyone laughing you. said things would normal basically defeated COVID months ago already  animals people getting US? Snake Oil salesmen old get rich? Quack doctors? Anti-establishment hippies? Evangelical pastors (not including guys tv - regularly tv get rich)? evidence sort evolutionary pressure case? comment exactly zero data available back Isn’t case pretty much every city? Moving goalposts. cost people get vaccine, creating subscription service model. tbe kroger one differentiate vaccine covid antibodies  Well they’re taking shot matters. Vaccine shot think one creators Oxford vaccine said same. Yeah vaccine companies financial incentive keep recommending vaccines prefer take advice CDC scientific organizations. guy still around? Mormon family know bedroom converted food storage. canned food, dried beans, rice, etc. eat it, replace immediately. haven’t really delta yet. I’m dreading it. one time leaked rural area (someone returned abroad rumour person chat neighbour); local government hard-locked tested 3 villages. CECC decided move entry quarantine government centres hotels (no quarantine home even live alone).

Imagine leaked Taipei level 3 restrictions. would torn right through. information wrong. 

Current: 23,057

Peak (January 12, 2021) : 28,889  in: Believing stupid things face opposition leads bad results. News 11. wait til mutates again! US European countries hoarding vaccine poorer, small countries still waiting get population even getting vaccinated throwing doses vaccine. COVID care vaccinated unfortunate ignorant chance mutation remains groups. Laws require act shareholders interest.

Obviously laws require make false statements, system created environment everything created around short term profit. They're anymore....   Get better God. Masks schools please. Someone tell Florida. Welp that’s happening.  line vaccinations local CVS insane today. Literally stretched pharmacy counter way front store. asked someone line waited long, told ""I guess time take things seriously.""  doubts before, stories anti-vaxxers dying enough tip edge.   Lol, I'm Italy. remember article, got ridiculed everyone, rightfully so. Please next time save embarrassment hastily googling first random source find hope looking informed.

Additionally, early days lockdown Wuhan similar. look [this see late January people still going *relatively* freely. around mid February lockdown got toughened point people got banned leaving compounds all. Obviously rest China lockdown significantly lighter whole period, except hotspots. idea NZ waited others needed patently true... believe it?  NZ placed order later oecd nations, willing pay get earlier. supply online, NZ vaccinating good rate. really case nobility, NZ continuing wait others get it? still plenty countries supply issues... Yet NZ happily vaccinates ahead them. NZs current level 4 lockdown surely succeed country covid zero again. achieved without vaccines.  change selfless selfish? Sure is. Prior immunity usually decreases transmission morbidity/mortality. 

It might effective vaccination definitely riskier, help. worn mask. great daily vaccination numbers, good luck all! agree entirely. altruism excuse case, would still waiting ""places need more"" get vaccinated rather started couple months ago. Probably quite long time yet too, since developing world going finished vaccinating quite time.  good point! easy, using logic. could upsetting way. look graph, well way flattening curve.

In fact could update daily like, way track learn together! 

I plan update next week minimum.

Cheers. Yep, Billy G. China putting finishing touches now. sympathy time low many posted willfully ignorant see them. almost everyone outside software development come January 1st 2000. Many will, hopefully majority. Definitely all. Protection infection. Protection severe illness hospitalisation remained 90+% range current elapsed months. ""So we're held hostage unvaccinated."" 


Wow It’s still hugely expensive treatment everyone able access. cases ever had. don’t think smug. 

I think pragmatic, folks annoyed worked. 

It’s lot Tall Poppy Syndrome frankly. ""Disney can't move""

Never dare Mouse Upper bound mortality probably around 1%, real value probably closer 0.5% hospital system overwhelmed, 0.3% (since regions overall mortality Covid19). 

330 million * 20% * 1% = 660 thousand. 
“” * 0.5% = 330 thousand

Can also assume would less would already infected unvaccinated population skews younger. 

I would prefer skipping unnecessary death vaccinating everybody, think realistically would less couple hundred thousand extra deaths - millions. vaccine protect 100% catching virus. dramatic lower risk bad course disease hospitalization. willing pay take people need now? changed? see absurd claim is? understand powerful political spin. question ignorance - compared vaccines (e.g. influenza), normal enough? in, always expected efficacy rates would fall way?  don’t think 100’s thousands deaths inevitable. think government everything power prevent that. may vain hope, way together, means hard yards Christmas, cool.

As country understand that, accept hard work comes it. 

But that’s decision, one think remembered well look back era.  That’s U.S. president 2016-2020 (whose name mention) arrogant started hate anyone deals absolutes comes vaccine. 

You know, moronic statements like: 
""Vaccinated people still get virus, therefore vaccine nothing good."" 
""Some people get side effects vaccine, therefore vaccine bad."" 

People like deserve get Covid, least 1 person world Covid without symptoms proves virus nothing everyone overreacting (or moron ""logic"" exceptions? know, trying understand hurts brain). remember thing last year. don’t care. Zero restrictions except literally banned leaving state...

I get WA extremely isolated anyway world able leave state even family emergencies etc would considered massive restriction far beyond us Europe dealt summer vaccines 100% efficacy infection. smaller chance catching comparison unvaccinated people. though, vaccine good preventing severe illness death. might mild symtpoms symptoms all. Lets imagine need additional vaccines multiple times. People afraid vaccines seems disease itself. safe vaccinate couple times get sick covid. could negative effects multiple vaccines reality?  anyone surprised? large numbers unvaccinated people taking even fewer precautions before. actually probably assume mutations like already happened. person happened never spread it. End strain.   ""Why would we?""

Because everyone needs global pandemic. Countries like Finland Bhutan got barely touched whole pandemic still secured vaccines early on. NZ done same, maybe could stopped covid zero nonsense spared month (hoping one) stage 4 lockdown.  barely anything you

That's survivorship bias.

If SARS-CoV-2 retains presymptomatic infectious period becoming much deadly, easily wipe us all. virus (obviously) can't successful kills host prior retransmission, successfully replicated spread, obligation keep host alive. vaccine 100% protection virus.  choir returned joint trip Italy. 31 people away. fully vaccinated coronavirus except one received one sting. long get shot 10 days exposed fine.

Their reason unless desolate place rabbies almost zero deaths. left untreated. fucked. Might well take easy way point. living beings!

That's nearly cut dried make be. definition 'living' kinda class 'species'. ask 100 biologists, probably get, like, 10-15 different answers. really hard nail down, pretty much human classifications nature really care about.

Bringing high school biology pretty moot, high school science classes teaching material cutting edge like... 80s 90s, best.

TL;DR, biologists think viruses qualify living, don't, also kind moot point, universe actually care bunch monkeys ball dirt decides call particular collection atoms.  Hello everyone

I looking data says odds dying (or hospitalized) vaccinated unvaccinated people different age groups. 

Something like “30-40 years old: Unvaccinated 1:100.000 – Vaccinated 1:1.000.000” on. is, data like different vaccines would even better. 

(I hope right place ask stuff like that)  think works like this. duration exposure matters. Constant exposure days end tantamount repeatedly rolling dice, whereas math assumes one single roll dice.

EDIT: mention vaccine efficacy % concept chance getting infected per incidence exposure. CDC plans send people door door, certain talking heads encouraged unvaxxed shoot healthcare workers. sure plan still not. aren’t allowed edit titles articles. It'll always ""What kill you, makes stronger."" talk applies sides. resistant ... current vaccines.

There selective pressure mutation beats acquired immunity, means slowly start popping proliferating among vaccinated people.

It sudden drastic first COVID-19 waves, since brand new virus, still contain structure us immune against.

A new vaccine, tailored modified spike protein, effective. Remember singing choir large spread virus too. Plus masks. what’s point? endless cycle money fear/control companies. (Yes, aware downvoted shit saying Reddit.) tell one dying covid. hospitals classifying way get sweet government $$$. we’re getting normal college experience least

Well... Except us middle college pandemic started. Online classes hell last year. Chemistry labs Zoom fucking pointless worst.

Not mention, lot us trying make connections get internships. I'm trying get med school couple years last year half, completely impossible find sort internship work kind bolster resume. exactly magical ""normal pre-2020 living"" place is? travelling anywhere still quite hassle best impossible worst, masks &amp; crowd restrictions still thing.

it's great youre fine now, far ""normal""  technical writing field enjoyable plain boring? IIRC making disease transmitted birds probably shit form. while.  Especially could vaccinated earlier less likely position No, millions people morons. are.

1. None current vaccines provide sterilising immunity, means vaccinated people participate mutating &amp; propagating virus.

2. Millions children vaccinated time soon extremely difficult assure vaccine safe youngest. Meanwhile, Israel already seeing sharp rise Delta cases among children younger 9, important transmission vector society.

3. Mutation seriously dampened current vaccines, firstly (1) also manufacturing &amp; distribution swamped slew factors ensuring even 10+ years world enough billions unvaccinated provide virus new mutations high rate. vaccine working expected need cloned antibody transfusions unless immunocompromised, whole point vaccines creating strong inmune response, main component inmune response antibodies.

If lots people dying blood loss due traffic accidents drunk driving maybe need drunk driving rather opening bunch blood banks. sure would go full trials again? Since adaptation, much simpler procedure, like flu shot? Trump came way video news (reddit) feed. Trump came like February. clip CPAC. Goes show u Reddit isn’t best source info, scenario it’s timing. lot lives could saved ppl actually got news news sites instead popularity sites Reddit. that's whole point vaccines. First vaccine needed covid virus mildly worse normal flu. get vaccine lethal variant likely emerge. Hi everyone double jabbed Pfizer caught covid anyway . Feel grim. Doctor told rang uncommon. ? ??? Anyone explain I'm double jabbed yet got virus ? still hoping comeback, message like flu right along. seem equate change numbers exponential growth correct. 

We steady growth, exponential growth, difference. 

Once *again* arguing me, arguing Dr. Ashley Bloomfield, expert field, expert team lot access information (or I) have. 

He says seeing exponential growth, need accept that. 

From [the ""The good thing steady growth, exponential,"" Bloomfield ""We know actions slow spread virus begin see slowing numbers increasing indeed, fact rate exponential explicitly Alert Level 4 “Contact tracing, isolation, community testing genomic tracing - together wastewater testing - powerful tools help us identify extent outbreak, important thing control people abide Alert Level 4 restrictions.""

You calling idiot doesn’t change fact seeing exponential growth. arguing expert, me. 

Cheers. No, it’s not. Masks magic, almost every place US masks worn year half point, numbers generally Actually likely don’t covid right vaccine technically gained ton ground. healthy that’s main goal here. they're still much risk catching it, spreading outcomes *worse* death. point vaccine never protect you, protect system. Similar data California. hospitalisations, 97% unvaccinated, 99.5% deaths unvaccinated people.

Breakthrough cases exist, negligible minority. Right now, pandemic industrialised countries propagated exclusively antivaxers, they're also taking normal people them. see much plan there, delaying inevitable hoping best mostly. 

I mean, cannot even much plan anyway. open, outbreaks anyone else. Must heartbroken that, making money. graduated 2019 pilot (earned licence part degree) one could say poor timing  make vaccine, Biontech develops it. clinical trials. talking this? ""We could wait"" bogus argument. Plenty countries ""could wait"" knew would happen case outbreak occurred soon. NZ preferred smug convincing special. gonna happen Im person two states I've wearing mask eating out. idiots like fauci need stop spewing crazy talk start reminding people still get delta even vaccinated likely spread well. means stocks lose value. However mean value fair, stable, set growth.

Just ... weary. hear company news again, means opportunity buy stocks gains likely gone, hike peak gets correction. though people think viruses work like Plague, Inc. like it'll mutate suddenly everyone who's infected new variant.  Given attitude towards would’ve thought you’d willing show superior credentials, what’s going here? Plan accordingly people, especially car crashes, heart attacks etc.

So many nurses health professionals burned out, leaving droves now.

Not Texas US, Canada even countries high vaccination rates. nearly 2 years this, end sight, understand. thought maybe conjugal visits may help yeah. people forget low cases dropped last summer Europe. 

And southern surges US delayed around two weeks compared last summer. strange seasonality nobody seems addressing. Larry David germaphobe pandemic. COVID make show even better. sister Kindergarten teacher (in inner city) started person. said class immature, developmentally delayed she’s ever had. kids likely spectrum need special attention didn’t pre-K getting intervention would typically get around 3 4. We're 8 years  Even that's thought, still gave disease directly resulted death! reaction that? Nope, all. Stay mad, science denier.   Pulling ass think ICU bed given covid-denyer anti-vaxxer whatever want call someone gotten vaccine? trying understand viewpoint.  Unless youre college student area trips liberal possible,

I say rather liberal dude going school LA. 2 weeks! vaccinated unvaccinated contract spread virus... locations per state region free. It’s everywhere. $600 ridiculous unfortunately found hard way labs charge lot basic tests. Yup. think people begging 5-12 vaccinations represented discussions. suspect child vaccinations shake 1/3 unless schools start requiring them. Goalposts, keep moving stonks mean Agree! felt like way comfortable skin high school. middle school braces, felt like parts body weren’t growing rate(huge feet/short height). also really annoying middle school… glad found chill. Fat chance. many stupid Americans. virus mutates anymore, people going start saying vaccine that's making mutate. There's end people's stupidity y'all know I'm lying.

I'm telling y'all prepare this. people talking Mayo Clinic data? study 14,000 people published New England Journal medicine showed Pfizer 88% effective preventing infection delta. Last heard, Mayo Clinic data peer reviewed. study spoke difference vaccine effectiveness much smaller among persons received second dose vaccine. “any vaccine” analysis, vaccine effectiveness 87.5% (95% CI, 85.1 89.5) alpha variant 79.6% (95% CI, 76.7 82.1) delta variant. BNT162b2 vaccine, small difference effectiveness variants seen second dose: 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 95.3) alpha variant 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 90.1) delta variant.” [Even looking clinical symptoms, children reduced disparities observed cases could explained children lower susceptibility infection, lower propensity show clinical symptoms both. estimate susceptibility infection individuals 20 years age approximately half adults aged 20 years, clinical symptoms manifest 21% (95% credible interval: 12–31%) infections 10- 19-year-olds, rising 69% (57–82%) infections people aged 70 years. believe unvaccinated individuals capable producing antibodies?  think less deadly flu suddenly? dead weight society along future

Your mindset cancerous choice wording makes abundantly clear. ideology predicated collectivism ""greater good"" always ended worst atrocities human history. Neither absolute anarchy authoritative imposition healthy conditions society advocate latter. free though, they're paid money. either account difference inflation printing money increased taxes, either way, that's money funneled pharmaceutical companies expense say matter.

Yeah, governments make calls people. expect direct democracy something? richest country world handle financial burden continuing keep vaccines available. care money, I'm pretty sure there's strong argument made financial burden COVID less vaccinated population even greater. affordable housing healthcare already huge problem compounding issue adding another layer payment even gain access right participate ordeal.

I kind doubt really concerned actually addressing issues. Would take money funneled around ""at expense say matter"" that's what's really important... think honest affording vaccines really last moral perspective, vaccine mandates fundamentally wrong.

I agree. arguing way think things would lead slippery slope arguments really pushed it. reality mandates vaccine would save many lives small burden individuals.

Edit: Also, flu vaccine also ""free"" end users cases well mandates.  Even awful system cares money people realized getting vaccines people cheaper dealing sick people. years ago, COVID visiting laws extended family came visit. baby brought sat baby lap while. 

Later night, realized flu.

I felt horrible! worried gave child. distraught, practically inconsolable. turned baby fine get sick. grateful.

My point is, understand someone realizing passed virus someone vulnerable might've preventable vaccine, feel huge weight guilt discover virus passed killed two people?! least there's Big Bend National Park. Part heart always live there. Perfect metaphor life: Sometimes things end abruptly fault try enjoy appreciate can. Ugh, Ohio state alum yet still Steelers fan  company work announced something similar. one allowed building Sept 1 without full vaccination. everyone required work least two days week office starting mid October. calling someone moron listening doctor disagree with. can't turn around make appeal authority next comment.

Also vaxxed, go back normal life. virus going away, ever. we're gonna get antibodies one way another. vaccinated person getting infected make news. vaccinated person getting infected make news (and get tweets). always represented discourse. daughter attended second day kindergarten today. told teacher COVID quarantine 2 weeks. make 2 days. faith us making past September.  r/nottheonion   tied stimulus money getting vaccinated  Fauci ever said anything first time actually ended correct? Every time something new come mouth never come fruition. It’s constantly updated. really say shit timelines. Can’t live life fear, go seize day. Thank you! Seriously. Slutbuster reality check. think people concept world actually works anymore. Mmmm...school lunch nostalgia...  Adopt pls year 3020. Humans expanded stars colonized hundred planets. defeated one sentient civilization reduced dust. allies lturians helped us develop flourishing civilization. However, backwater system single named habitable planet named Floribamassippianasas, Covid 3020 broken out. 

All systems managed stop spread wearing masks (a part exosuits) vaccines (now jellybean flavors). Yet Floribamassippianasas pandemic rages. Iturians urge Federation glass planet inhabitants contain danger. use fact Floribamassippianasasans’ advanced transport bass fishing boat evidence hope inhabitants joining humanity stars. 

President Andrew Obama Clinton Roosevelt Eisenhower Washington looks Galactic Admiral. “With heavy heart must tell glass them. won’t listen science, believe universe flat, refuse acknowledge reality. must end sad chapter join civilizations universe.” 2025 we’re making alien contact won’t even matter Agree armchair doctor statement, 100%. image problem people like me. people think immunocompromised, think people cancer, AIDS, HIV, something along lines. think someone see carrying life normally thats vast majority is. boss? got awful autoimmune disorder bet absolute tank woman gives all.

Indy100 news aggregator; original article Olympian , Coronavirus ultimate game changer,wow pay them?  Caring others communism. tax breaks untaxed organization get?  Lol 😂 Seasonality doubt strong factor. don‘t know see controversial. Look Ukraine versus Chile past two three months. Ukraine barely vaccinating cases still dropped like stone entered summer. Chile vaccinating early well, still struggling entered winter. saw last year Germany well. Unusually warm September, barely spread. Literaly week weather turned cases hit like ton bricks nothing else unchanged (schools already began weeks earlier). Florida Texas also popping around time last year. There‘s million things play course, seasonality seems like major factor. WINNING! Fascinating says lot stuff. I'm vaccinated wearing 3 masks like Fauci said do.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* likely similar mandate smallpox vaccine compulsory everyone take matter situation unless medically dangerous.  They're still people.  Certainly summer heat kill virus. True, everyone different pandemic experience. goal set months ago still policy. Call CDC actually starts setting standards. think next 6 months see people learn (maybe hard way) vaccines much safer alternative...

Yeah, think ""oh shit"" moment recently Delta variant spike people realized verge burning finally got vaccinated. Same. got grad degree music. Final project write symphony. Spent months rehearsing full orchestra. One week premier shutdowns began. 

My symphony never get played. never opportunity again. flat-out told kids never happening. never going away. best case scenario, keep vaccines date variants becomes seasonal flu type deal. i'm vaccinated, they'll vaccinated soon they're eligible (HURRY FUCK FDA), we'll getting boosters recommended, honestly expect result worry covid anymore, 2022 2025 ever. easier pessimistic constantly disappointed.  consider scenario social distancing impossible. Maybe populated area, that's really mandate targeting understanding.    Yes. Someone needs get damn stockbrokers. Exactly. Masks one part issue, real problem enough people getting vaccinated, schools like colleges even requiring vaccination. Yeah, fat relationship per say, intimacy companionship things make happy. believe may trying reply directly specific person. so, bottom right hand corner comment “reply” button, simply click reply directly individual; response end notifications comment like one. Exactly. gotta make sure obese Americans get treatment last matter vax status. people made lifelong poor medical choices. 29x likely hospitalized unvaccinated, 5x likely get Covid unvaccinated.

What happened ""numbers guys""?  positive side vaccine still reduces hospitalization risk least 10x

There's nothing wrong that. point thinking even higher that. again, doesn’t show chance going hospital. shows infection. We’ve reached plateau. Anyone wanted vaccinated is. Anyone doesn’t continue not.


This happens live social media crazed society doesn’t know difference credibility doctor guy went high school flunked science.  I’m curious people feel sending kids school year. daughters first year real school know Covid general effects kids less, delta variant thrown wrench us. hate idea missing “school experience” obviously don’t want dumb. Dr. Strange going pissed vaccine **only** reduces likelihood dying getting seriously ill **~96%**

Not attacking funny seeing *only* followed 96%. 

Re antibody infusion; cheap plentiful. Ideally, folks would vaccinated antibody infusions would reserved high risk individuals (elderly, immunocompromised, comordities). Steal value meal twofer.  mostly fatigued second moderna body aches. definitely hits people harder. Hope feel better soon valid concern raise. implement vaccine mandates subsequent mandatory booster shots every 6 months, essentially turning access daily life subscription service model. Hahaha communication end mask mandates realy end insight everyone vaccinated icus strains healthcare gone. 

They can’t give end date new strains something else may change.  alpha wild strains vaccine blocked virus spreading seeing break infections.  Delta changed that.

TL;DR can’t give end date since things change target met prolonging public health measures. First all, great suggestions.

I'm saying ""we enough"" all.. Honestly everything said seems legit. Beyond legitimate, suggestions seem reasonable actionable.

My follow-up question would be: pay this? implement? get hesitant board without killing them, simultaneously protecting everyone else?

I ask questions 1) simply know, I'm simple person limited info make decisions 2) want people grasp full reality I'm asking; there's simple answer. solutions minds might work, basing assumptions limited information. think know best reality know nothing, take lil modesty pill. wait Covid-22😬 Ok...but start rumor guys gaining solid 1/2 inch second shot? yes mean solid. Thanks this. might people get concerns first second shot, getting voluntarily take third shot may difficult. covid cases subside, may big deal people get grandfathered requiring proof 2 shots jobs. depends much waning happens, effective boosters are, many cases are. 

Also new variants might make current vaccines count anymore, even antibodies long-term immunity WT stays. that's issue vaccines waning. ever find prison, feel like ramen would one things available would remind humanity, simple may be.

The state society sad one, I'm glad people might winning twice scenario; vaccinated, something feel happy about. Disney World (what I'm assuming mean ""Disney"") mandating vaccines visitors. employees right now. study 50,000 patients Mayo Clinic Health System, researchers found **effectiveness Moderna's vaccine infection dropped 76% July** - Delta variant predominant - 86% early 2021. period, **the effectiveness Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine fallen 42% 76%**, researchers insert &lt;laughing crying shouldn’t, science increasingly shows universal masking outdoors significant effect. that's messed hospital system sad.. kids missing really great events. Prom graduation two looked forward years. I’d felt really sad able attend either them. certainly portion people think vaccine evil whatever, also portion people necessarily reject medical science instead think risk Covid overblown entirely made up. get Covid realize need medical help. I’m stupid yet I’m psychopath, who’s winning? Endless variants, never let end   Ah sorry get notification children accepted? kid currently waitlisted placed 3rd grade sure what’s next. Also, working parent? Okay Today second day new class fifth graders. smiles energy beenradiating classroom…even masks on. It’s amazing feel happy back something somewhat “normal”. hope last longer 3 weeks person…and FDA cannot approve vaccine kids quick enough.  Ten days resolution symptoms (except cough anosmia, may last weeks,) good enough. Especially vaccinated. know doesn’t stay contagious past point. grandma 92, got COVID, didn’t even got hospital recovered. vaccine. She’s oxygen. never before. believe COVID partially blame 100% blame. always good health life healthy weight. Okay , use punctuation next time

Thanks advise 

Be well

Sorry bad anyone even read article? says applies outdoor events social distancing possible. blanket outdoor mask mandate. concerts similar events.

The headline misleading clicks. kids vaccinated flu? age category pretty much risk. 

Of death. 2% kids flu end hospital though. still understand kids getting very, sick developing MIS-C. pussies showing school board meetings demanding kids attend school without mask regulations.

&amp;#x200B;

Shitbagoons gonna shit  Well think narrative ""what children"" Delta variant contagious seems infecting young ones alpha variant was. across nation increase number cases children return school course corresponding increase number hospitalizations.

Here latest data available. nice little article interviewing pediatricians:   opinion recommendations logical given circumstances time. Efficacy preventing hospitalization same. number fell 80% efficacy, all, isn’t bad. active stock market might disagree regarding productive part, agree intended sentiment wholeheartedly none less. Pussies. claim they're tough afraid anything guns. what's problem? zeta, eta, theta comes along... equate reading shit random people Internet ""research."" Oh, research scientist? Internet connection too!  Paywall. titers don’t say you’re immune per se, says immune response surface antigen — is, immune system recognizes virus. That’s akin antibodies COVID vaccination, it’s guarantee can’t get breakthrough infection. It’s better say you’ve vaccinated immune response.

(FWIW rheumatologist puts HBV panel routine bloodwork lab reports REACTIVE/NON-REACTIVE antibodies, even numeric level.) difficult things considered. dating? one wants date me, lol. opted son preschool, sucks lottery system hard get into. way, there’s many brainwashed idiots America. old kids get masks well work? thing PCR test done clear based symptoms. fever severe disease. Still lingering cough taste/smell. 

 However, it’s 10 days. **I**nfection **F**atality **R**ate Covid around 1%. IFR smallpox around 30%.

1 x 30 = 30.

This lie, misunderstanding comment responding to.

But right delta infectious smallpox. alpha strain not.  appreciate link. surprised much hesitancy back more, suppose can't know. 

Regardless, pretty fucking obvious people today feel differently covid vaccine versus MMR vaccine find sickening many people like op initially responded seemingly incapable thinking topic memes.

My anger you, guy. Neat. hope never ends. like pandemic saga. wonders medicine. (I’m joking). many days ago get first dose? Even titers say I’m immune? agree it’s warrant reckless behavior Yeah really showed guy knew talking about. said bold things like:

The pandemic going global

We going lockdowns US

We prepared would affect lives since would biggest pandemic since Spanish flu. 

I stared ceiling night. I'm scientist virologist involvement FDA... know approve things they're deemed safe based science.

Sorry, response vague reason... booster children vaccines safe they're deemed so. Would prefer rush things knowing might unsafe, appease public?

Not rude here, frank, anything. *sigh*........guess we're fucked what?

 still ""REAL NEWS""!! really find hard believe vaccines optional prison. none stories, one hundreds others like it, get retold Faux. beat goes on. logic go least another year this. Relevant username like packed bars COVID, miss going almost empty ones. pandemic won’t 2024 Sorry want vomit dear

This old lady aware history see writing wall.plus lazy use punctuation 
But got drift anyway ?
If ,sorry ..can say try 
Be well  Legally speaking parents married? Sure.

Realistically? gonna want page making decision.

Unmarried? cases take unless one parent ""deadbeat.""  may... Would nice know, make covid less dangerous learned flu dangerous assume. Among Us Carol Baskin winter zoom Christmas? Fully agree Yeah that’s fair. 

It’s also weird Midwest ok, except Missouri. strange virus. beds available foreseeable medical emergencies faced pandemic Experts never said large waves large amounts hospitalization we're seeing never end. understanding experts said, typical comments sub. agree chronic issues burden healthcare resources currently set place (in America). 

And. say one answer fix would lie, id billionaire responding Reddit, lol. 

But there’s many factors go play, debate Reddit isn’t place, especially different nuances play it. 

But. start. total failure country healthcare, prevention, education, etc. years powers ignored, mighty dollar. obviously exacerbated current pandemic it’s strain resources currently it. fix night? course not. 

So ask, healthcare professionals getting fed now? It’s 100% effective resource (yes vaccine healthcare resource tool) effectively reduce spread, importantly hospitalization rate. it’s willfully ignored mentioned before. part (my opinion here) that’s really getting healthcare professionals misinformation spread covid vaccine, factual standing science. 

Imagine completely discarding vaccine Bc microchips it, it’s designed kill/control you, whatever half brained reason get is. people (not everyone didn’t get vaccine admittedly, majority would say least anecdotal experience) willfully ignore science medical advice, dismiss it. Yet first seek treatment drain resources 02 sats drop 92. believe it’s straining healthcare professionals currently working ass (for year) stressful/tiring situations. It’s literal slap face. 

Now tie together best way, imagine (healthcare professionals/healthcare system) boat middle ocean. sudden. 100 holes, quickly filling boat sea water, inevitably leading sinking boat causing sink. Obesity. COPD. Heart issues. Etc. COVID represent holes “boat”. Now. biggest hole (by 3x-4x) filling boat fastest time COVID hole. MUST immediately act patch hole prevent quickest demise “boat”, quickest (easiest obtain, cheapest, proven safest) “patch” everyone use patch vaccine. immediately cover hole prevent water filling prevent quickness water sinking ship. 

Does mean “holes” (re COPD, obesity, diabetes) also sinking ship huge issue? all. must better nation empathetic people plug holes. way get plugging holes, “vaccine patch” isn’t applied effectively timely. resources continued thrown hole, continues grow, could (and have) able patch pin prick, titanic iceberg level hole. 

And throw attention trying patch COVID hole, there’s really reason point bringing holes, yes filling boat, far even close rate COVID hole is. think wrong subreddit; climate change. vaccinations estimated 80% effective preventing infection study period. 

Not bad really  thought-trip earlier was, head, defending movement 1-10 student-teacher ratio, *even then* thought ridiculous one adult human charge *TEN CHILDREN.* 

I understand society expect singular adult human handle children time. There's reality makes sense. 

All said... Thank so, much do. poor starving time I'd donate extra salary y'all, joke. rather clear it. another wave cases already incredibly high. fact mask mandate late, early. Hey there, also isolating right Covid. got vaccine well. short, it’s keep healthcare system collapsing. proof still get sick hope we’re also proof won’t get hospitalized it’ll run course mild rather severe symptoms home. know state today first time announced there’s ICU beds Covid patients. timing sick Covid hear information! knees thankful grateful I’ve vaccinated science given gift us. hopeful return teaching soon instead spending weeks months recovering. hope feel better soon! Hmm, maybe commit crime… Right. Vaccine infection would much safer way around. 100% Anecdotal evidence, spent days outside camping friends. Apparently, one vaccinated happened covid. another friend breakthrough infections. group vaccinated earliest late January. far, rest vaccinated tested negative. Ya I'm kinda delirious right getting third booster today holy fuck abs sore laughing comment thread 🤣 lot deniers Ashland Medford White City? used live Ashland 2006 part program trying convince parents vaccines cause autism. parents changed mind end day, astounded me. educated and, likely, wealthy. wrap head around position. news reports proof God real? sure plenty realness Covid. countries worse outbreaks already done it. decide whether countries waste doses, even did, thousands still better zero. again, excuses.   know several people took approach. finally got jab seeing Delta surge. contact someone tested positive. flatmate. get pfizer shot now? help short time frame? tested negative yesterday. Here’s comprehensive answer, saying it’s 100% probably something might already know.

There’s lot factors come play: age, general health immune system. Secondary considerations might include time since got full vaccination. 

It really ""common"" ""rare"" either. Saying something common tends one statements people make don’t reflect actual statistics. biggest consideration vaccine doesn’t give 100% protection contracting virus know - likely made huge difference recovery seriousness infection. 

Think like Kevlar body vest. wear might never get shot (get infected). wear get shot end bruise (as - symptoms serious enough call doctor) bruise serious enough hospitalized. Yes, still hospitalized shot wearing vest aren’t dead. -10^45 unfair estimates. Leviticus 13:45-46 says otherwise would Jesus. issue is- we’re bunch laymen relayed information media full bunch laymen relaying information incredibly complex science. suggest people follow @sailorrooscout @mugecevik Twitter among immunologists. give straight, way informative news since they’re actual experts field.

I actually made Twitter account answer. right. thoroughly convinced vaccines work point, still get shocked/confused/unsettled reading media headlines. mean, probably purpose - get readers otherwise, think counterproductive times like these.

Do accounts recommend follow stay date research also understand research means? 10k title bit misleading Usually authors write headlines. Maybe subs allowed submitters alter titles address misleading nature headlines, we'd better. live mostly rural TX county way many people act like Covid exist. Low vaccine rate, hardly anyone wears masks, businesses capacity, events going usual. Thankfully, huge amount deaths, probably due low population density really big events outdoors. someone die Covid complications, family admit it. hear things like: happened? ""They got sick, took turn worst make it"". get sick with? ""Oh, kind crud, got lungs gave 'em pneumonia"". Basically saying died Covid without saying died Covid.  saw mentioned official verbiage/an article saying recommended? Need send mom definitely press issue anti-vaxers staff. negligence child endangerment part. feel pain daycare thing though. We’ve move change daycares three times 2 years. 

Things peds different. drugs, safe dose per kg adults maybe lethal peds, especially younger age groups. vaccines careful one goal vaccine ramp immune system get respond strongly antigen want start targeting. effect ingredients vaccines essentially excite immune system. Dosing important though. want excite immune system want excited reduce effectiveness vaccine. 

You also really want studies done large enough sample sizes even 1% kids reaction vaccine start applying kids population huge number kids. 

There probably argument companies FDA done studies pediatric populations concurrently studies adults, time passed. want studies quickly possible still correctly. Especially given large numbers anti-vaxers latch publicize vaccines rolled early dosages optimized peds significant numbers bad outcomes. could reduce vaccination rate reduce effectiveness getting vaccinated (more exposure risk breakthrough infections). 

In short want scientists get right first time can’t stress enough important dose size pediatric medicine. Also sounds like start looking ways pressure daycare requiring staff vaccinated. Unfortunately good daycares definitely supply sided market don’t know there’s lot good options there. kind needless endangerment others anti-vaxers part piss us medical field much. Fire her.

This. refuses come work it, job abandonment. shows refuses wear mask, policy violation. wants sue wrongful termination, let her, watch lose. alternative headline could ""the coronavirus could become less deadly"". still exemptions. Parents needed send note areas. literally never got told points. even little leaflet. What's point , surely vaccine ? 

Aren't vaccines meant , vaccinate ?

Why everyone care getting vaccine vaccinate , original desease 0.5-1% mortality rate ? 

Why people care much ?

Feel lied want get jab half made really jail time something different. like saying ""Man drove without license gets sentenced death"" death sentencing murdering people. stupid. yeah gets clicks. expect hearing Corona virus day die. It’s going away, ever. lifetime, yours. Give three shots time send Covid’s house. I’ll end pandemic real quick. Studies show kinds shit, one informing booster shot policy shows increasing vulnerability hospitalization among elderly starting around 8 months. reached herd immunity, Covid would account 10% deaths school age children.   would follow current FDA guidence, says get one month apart.

I pretend know FDA, think fine discussion Reddit, would take medical advice somebody Reddit. COVID kill people, people kill people... True. Maybe genius Larry David company could find something pandemic would work. problem finding something beat death already memes Twitter everyone else. dunno. think lot principals would bothered act refusing directive rather risks associated refusal said directive. really ask prayers thoughts ton thoughts situation I'm 1 inch away spewing everytime happens. sad loved ones doubt pushing vaccine worried would happen. rest encouraged shit, ya go! wanted. true, studies shown immunity clearly decreased 6 month mark. total disaster coming, vaccinated higher spread Delta variant I'd say pandemic devastate NZ.  obviously reading posts.

I'm NZ.

[Millions already donated right-meaning stupid people. Philippines archipelago comprises 7,641 islands - distribute there?  tested positive days ago. Minor cold symptoms. Pfizer vaccine. Quarantining now. saw morning announced antibodies went lot second dose yes recommend booster. Yay Victoria! gets many parents complaining kids getting proper education whole remote learning, cool schools close week longer kids learning anything all.

I get it. sent back school option remote anymore, thankfully fully vaccinated still worry bring home school shut point think reason back in-school learning ""but remote learning working!!!"". Well, get miss possibly even more. that's see immunity wane. eight months, need booster. Never heard pronounced “pa-riss”. I’ve heard “PAIR-iss”. Ruined? Wow. Literally go get third shot want one. one stop you. Click bait title. Shame you, OP  Without opening article, republican? can't say country could accept vaccines, waste fewer NZ. Okay then, lets send get thrown away. Great idea, brainiac. Oh, cool. get free antibody testing part COVID benefits (this timeline worst...) tested positive COVID Friday. guess I'll go get antibody testing see virus versus vaccine. also right let lol. wish could take back,"" said.

I impressed. Anyone see anything j&amp;j booster recommended? That's far likely vaccine's reactogenicity, inflammatory response immune system body kicks high gear trying ""save"" you. thing happens fight flu viruses enzyme described covid-19, would likely suffocate death peacefully lot respiratory viruses body mount crazy response trying fight viruses, including things like fever inflammatory response. know suffocating death sound peaceful, there's really real thing doctors see walking dead people happily walking talking critically low oxygen levels hours days away dropping dead. author article. Titles misleading Agreed. zoom episode thought episode alright. I'm referring show think NBC maybe.  looks good J&amp;J quickly infected, many overall. 

I included caveat mortality becomes worse hospital overwhelmed, saying impossible. mention God really makes impressive. agnostic fuck even know god would want everyone wear mask. stories bible like this. literally like reading quoting play book whole lives game day opposite. 6 months yes? Already got mine long vaccine somehow reverse everything gonna fine  understand boosters made. flu, example, yearsssss surveillance data. lot times scientists guessing strain based data. can't necessarily get ahead covid strain like that. 

Also, there's optics play. public want 7 booster shots. makes sense give current vaccine (which provide decent protection severe delta cases), plan January release new booster formula, gives time monitor new strains along way. course, there's pressure get right. I’m convinced all. don’t know won’t say people got J&amp;J, go ahead get Pfizer Moderna dose. J&amp;J used virus carry payload. body attack carrier virus. say doesn’t appear issue, haven’t studied real world yet. Historically wars fought territory. Sure, tribal warfare includes concept divine duty acquire land, that's used excuse reason unto itself. say never happens, nearly common people throw around.

Distilled core, human nature; exists regardless religion. that's fighting fire fire! disrespect title... Since keep posting over, I'll keep giving reply.

You could easily donate share developed countries still deaths day Nz total, among fully vaxxed, support booster policy. could also make donations poorer countries, price factor.

Or maybe donate Australia speed campaign since outbreak right now.

You're making excuses even need make, said Nz MUST donate doses. heard friend ""who cares, everything worthwhile life causes period disruptions!""  end pandemic seems far again. Another lockdowns, another regulations worrying numbers anti-vaxxers. staying high plateau. vaccine symptoms/recovery time look like curiosity? Maybe people need take vaccine… horse medicine stay hospital you’d say it’s God-given right leave class whenever feel like it. Someone said day…all people dead what? supposed move lives pretend didn’t happen? national outrage mourning ? accepting death moving like 🤷‍♀️? didn’t know answer her. sound like whiny kid,

I promise you, don't. already this. job we’re required get flu shot annually various titers checked hired on.  Hahaha. Good thing I've never uttered visited family there. Haha. Without knowing getting breakthrough, dataset grossly incomplete. would good know many infected getting seriously ill.... many people actually getting infected. especially important population vaccinated quite different population unvaccinated, instance, people serious underlying conditions (like Cancer HIV) chance getting vaccinated. Elderly fairly high vaccinate rates too. much this. Chise one best sources there, incredibly well-versed subject matter knows cut bullshit explain things way rest us make sense (and without absurd negativity everything).

But overall, funny joke anti-vaxxers moving goalposts time, rest us keep thing. time last year, hoping vaccine could clear 50% efficacy floor severe disease death, we're upset vaccines drop \~50% 6 months *against infection*. problem much news, data analysis done unqualified people thrown us daily basis; hard make sense (and exposed vast majority people lack even basic understanding statistics). 

Long story short, vaccines work, work well, happy continue work medium-term hospitalization death (maybe even long-term, data yet). end day, that's vaccines supposed do. hear people arms flu shot generally 30-40% effectiveness rate, even advertised making symptoms less severe catch it. That's COVID vaccines viewed, except cross-spectrum usefulness significantly higher flu vaccine. Oh, clarify, doesn’t give odds… calculate that. ""odds"" tbh, aren’t going useful there’s many factors come play personal basis, like region infectious rate, policies etc. 

As well Canada primarily 2 vaccines- Moderna Pzier - AstraZeneca stopped relatively early.  personal choice unquestionably impacts others will. really simple, are. do. Odd.

I devout Christian course spiritual journey come realize Christianity teaches stop self absorbed concerned needs others.

In context, maybe, maybe, like wearing mask? people spreading misinformation profit charged international criminals. article say 1 ended hospital? Google Translate make mention that. count lucky. I'm still sad everyone lost, including small things. wrote: 

Many developed countries right deaths day Nz total, among vaxxed, rushing secure boosters. could donate share it.

Affordability nothing it, could donate like countries done Pfizer (e.g. Poland recently). infrastructure lame excuse, decide whether country infrastructure factor either way, otherwise could give vaccinating underdeveloped world hey, they're gonna infrastructure anyway, bother.

You're making excuses, funniest thing is, even need making them, like argue donate share - course don't. part, part, part. 


I always say got vaccinated rest country. city, relatives, hospital staff, states don’t compete New York resources help hospitals… 


But I’m ready think I’m frustrated, virus attack past best vaccines we’ve got. 
    don’t want get sick. don’t care it’s mild, don’t want get sick. mother-in-law elderly diabetes; don’t want lose her.

Now it’s me, feel betrayed let Spanish flu stopped mutated tranmissable nonlethal strain. Misleading nearly 50 U.S. Tyson chicken plants opportunity win $10,000, week next five weeks, they've received least one dose vaccine, according internal flyer posted Facebook.  announcement, company said would pay worker $200 get vaccine, addition previous policy offering four hours pay get jab outside normal work hours away Tyson location.

I mean, still great incentive title makes sound like every vaccinated employee gets $10k. Ah - sort of. trials usually prove effectiveness rather safety. We've established vaccine safe initial dose, booster needs prove actually effective clinical trials. booster also approved either emergency authorized use FDA approval. clinical trial data submission booster, we're usually looking different standards.  Prisoners can’t get another job switch different university. It’s one place where, believe 100% vaccinated, mandate would actually unethical. 

Though society decided treating prisoners unethically perfectly fine, I’m also surprised. perspective, hated remote learning classroom. felt like actually learn anything, even wanted to. Apparently needed learning environment even get things done. take away me, I'm brain dead person Earth. Also, easy get distracted, least. could turn camera, phone whole time, play Xbox whatever. long vaccines kept free people widespread access like now, matter paperwork.

They're free though, they're paid money. either account difference inflation printing money increased taxes, either way, that's money funneled pharmaceutical companies expense say matter. Access affordable housing healthcare already huge problem compounding issue adding another layer payment even gain access right participate ordeal.

From moral perspective, vaccine mandates fundamentally wrong.     High vaccination rate relative term. still 40% population running around unvaccinated spreading virus. guess US ""wont get past it"" since way get 90% population fully vaccinated. year 3020. Humans expanded stars colonized hundred planets. defeated one sentient civilization reduced dust. allies lturians helped us develop flourishing civilization. However, backwater system single named habitable planet named Floribamassippianasas, Covid 3020 broken out. systems managed stop spread wearing masks (a part exosuits) vaccines (now jellybean flavors). Yet Floribamassippianasas pandemic rages. Iturians urge Federation glass planet inhabitants contain danger. use fact Floribamassippianasasans’ advanced transport bass fishing boat evidence hope inhabitants joining humanity stars. President Andrew Obama Clinton Roosevelt Eisenhower Washington looks Galactic Admiral. “With heavy heart must tell glass them. won’t listen science, believe universe flat, refuse acknowledge reality. must end sad chapter join civilizations universe.” Boomer here. You’re completely correct. I’ll add back media give voice people like Jenny McCarthy others ilk. could get interesting.

Let fight. did? High fiving? care social distancing?!

This obviously good news. They're gonna need help get. Don’t worry vaccine. took sucked 3 hours. fever, chills, shakes, nausea, puked lot (I prone vomiting easily due illness). happened 9 hours injection (2:30-5:30am range). I’m young adult age (20-25 years old). fell asleep 5 morning woke 10 feeling fine. symptom slight fatigue. following day symptoms. disappeared. back normal 24 hours injection. Easy recovery. hell stayed optimistic? kinda antidepressants on? want some. everyone would followed rules likely would have. Working great Israel Remember trump made chief medical adviser president 2019 liked **Sam Seaborn**: 1940, armed forces among twelve formidable world, obviously going big war. Roosevelt said U.S. would produce 50,000 airplanes next four years. Everyone thought joke. was, turned produced 100,000 airplanes. Gave Air Force armada would block sun. vaccine efficacy wanes time took time Delta become dominant strain, curious whether vaccine actually less effective delta so, approximately much less effective vs original. think effectiveness boosters give better view this. boosters highly effective delta vaccines waning effective.  I'm losing hope. seems like way get Covid-19 US control there's people left catch it.

Until disease started really absolutely fucking clue stupid people be, compared before. \[removed\]  Ramen sounds like much better currency cigarettes. every person thread saying kind thing needs take long look mirror naked see mortality vulnerability. better hope vulnerable body lands hospital shortages fixed people made smarter demands system instead taking callous executioners stance.  want lifestyle determining factor care get?  want panel nurses assess redeeming qualities mistakes?  Really look people.  I’m vaccinated fully reject notion caste system y’all proposing dystopian nightmare instead demanding infrastructure. Like WHY?! job market 10 years ago. force, per say, employers schools vaccine requirements, nowhere turn vaccine. create community desert care. 

Living society requires social contract. anything otherwise would like coddling people prefer drive opposite side road. puts lives danger, expected either comply societal norms fuck right off. Thing is, ready able go everyone else around (more less) ready go too. True. Exactly   valid question think going forward. But, implement vaccine mandates subsequent mandatory booster shots every 6 months, essentially turning access daily life subscription service model.

this necessarily true all. TBH think know enough much speculate, let's go pretty bad scenario boosters really needed every 6 months. long vaccines kept free people widespread access like now, matter paperwork. bit hassle sure, wish life easy. want talk subscription service model life let's talk education housing rest healthcare on. Two weeks flatten curve! it! roughly 20 times less likely.

So obviously worth mandating masks environment. bang buck. feel bad kids yet another year ""normal"". field trips, expect stops starts virtual learning, temperature checks, etc. We've already give one one activity quarantine requirements.

BUT I'm going put brave face kids. online options even did, work well kids. kids older elementary. guess stop feeding troll. headline says ""pandemic"".

People need get grip actually look numbers. taken good look trash around country? unvaxxed fucks DIE OFF, nothing going get better  Dr. Optimism willfully ignoring autumn disaster vaccination rates improve dramatically, sensible person expects will. Probably not. there's time medically socially acceptable wear mask, probably wouldn't. like wear shirt area shirt-wearing weird. said, may start wearing n95 masks often even get rid covid things like flu season air pollution bad (yay pre-existing respiratory illness!)

Masks make lot sense wear shirts 90% time climate. Uh, people already passed genes unfortunately. Anti intellectualism unfortunately also seems hereditary too. good fitting, layered cloth mask nearly effective N95. mask wearing substantially reduces transmission severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 2 ways. First, masks prevent infected persons exposing others SARS-CoV-2 blocking exhalation virus-containing droplets air (termed source control). aspect mask wearing especially important estimated least 50% transmissions persons never develop symptoms presymptomatic phase COVID-19 illness.1 recent laboratory experiments, multilayer cloth masks effective single-layer masks, blocking much 50% 70% exhaled small droplets particles.2,3 cases, cloth masks performed similar surgical procedure masks source control. Second, masks protect uninfected wearers. Masks form barrier large respiratory droplets could land exposed mucous membranes eye, nose, mouth. Masks also partially filter small droplets particles inhaled air. Multiple layers fabric fabrics higher thread counts improve filtration. However, observed effectiveness cloth masks protect wearer lower effectiveness source control,3 filtration capacity cloth masks highly dependent design, fit, materials used. Standards cloth masks needed help consumers select marketed Richard Sear, co-author study Leader Soft Matter Group University Surrey, said:

""While wearing simple relatively inexpensive cloth face mask cannot eliminate risk contracting COVID-19, measurements theoretical model suggests highly effective reducing transmission. hope work inspires mask designs optimised future hope helps remind people importance continuing wear masks COVID-19 remains present filtration, effectiveness, fit, performance cloth masks inferior medical masks respirators. Cloth mask use mandated healthcare workers, priority provided proper respiratory protection. Cloth masks suitable option community use medical masks unavailable. Protection provided cloth masks may improved selecting appropriate material, increasing number mask layers, using design provides filtration fit. Cloth masks washed daily high-exposure use using soap water appropriate methods. think good news all.

You would think COVID exist here, gauging people's behaviors. workplace (manufacturing customer facing, thankfully) require vaccines, require masks vaccinated. Nobody work masked many open anti-vax. Nobody checking that. workplace COVID policies incentivizes getting testing, burn limited PTO get negative result. I'm regularly teased still wearing mask work.

We marked essential lockdowns we're happening, despite stated reason us staying open 0.004% output, run product lockdown anyway. We're going shut coronavirus again, automotive shutdowns pull rug orders. 29x lower risk hospitalized vaccinated, 5x lower risk catching COVID. saying we're fucked. Got it. UK is, fact, good place ""right"" endanger others. ""teachers"" do. comment needs way, way higher up.  got us vaccinating. begging people get jabs that.  think opposite, covid deadly compared past pandemics people seem brush off. think people would literally need bodies streets take shit seriously.     Folks seem justifying willingness leave people dead based assumptions effectiveness assumptions personality unvaxed person assumptions pandemic would wasn’t folks.  know even 90 percent vax,  need beds, would prevent waves happening variants, always prevent hospitalization 1) Israel ultra high vax rates (Pfizer) hospitals full anyway, cannot admit new covid patients.  Why?

Choose heed medical advice peril! Uh oh. wonder know it’s approved FDA yet (just EUA). Gotta get mud fight little! would technically true everyone actually stayed completely isolated away everyone weeks. nigh impossible actually enforce.  That’s sound advice, except antibody treatment primarily used save lives unvaccinated people. Rarely administered people vaccinated, though used symptomatic breakthrough cases patient immunocompromised risk factors.

Nobody say sure whether De Santis actually profiting treatments, sure odd fighting hard guarantee everyone FL exposed COVID pushes treatments cost hell lot 5 cent mask costs. Prevention essentially free, almost zero economic cost, sickness cure costly, guaranteed, cost FL economy billions well thousands lives. Ban vaccinated stadium! Let super spreading begin! remember reading back covid infection/recovery vaccine might best combo. reverse? Vaccine infection/recovery? went get tested today cause feel like garbage. Gonna get results tomorrow. I'm worried I've fully vaxxed 2 months Moderna, I'm curious resistance increase aftery body opportunity deal real thing, training vaccine. armchair experts sub say “just approve it” without realizing myriad concerns dosing differences infect you?

And likewise evolve variants?

Do want novel strain evolve get past vaccination (which would lead lockdowns again), much deadly younger people get out?

I sure don’t. Hahahaha fit theme becoming monster fight monsters. 95% frighteningly low. especially feel sorry 5% vaccinated. know fda approves vaccine? It’s looking school outbreaks saying “yeah good enough let’s approve it”. It’s rigorous process It’s absurd. Places Staten Island already it. couldn’t go Chiles BWW eat go movies. care random people? didn’t make headline saying nearly half….. thank That’s said last time   almost completely agree. gets dicey start considering covid related vs non covid related.

Doubt Vaccines prevent transmission Delta - solution stop shutting schools kids get Covid Several positive tests different types. symptoms mild (literally lost sense smell took test first place). also tested positive antibodies test couple weeks covid cleared I'd say definitely it. odd unheard apparently.  get *enough* people vaccinated pretty much business normal. guts mandate participate things. ""Bolsonaro files lawsuit Supreme Court Congress **for** law granting compensation healthcare workers incapacitated due covid-19 pandemic.""

Sorry butchering title. I'm native speaker hurry. sympathy went looked Facebook profile. There's lot hate towards minorities, Pro Confederacy crap, transphobic stuff, along anti mask crap would expect including political gun stuff. asks money help pay funeral federal assistance funds. 

But never say safe wearing mask getting vaccinated making mistake acknowledge things would prevented happened husband. sorry feeling much sympathy I'm sort right people.

She business nails hope infect lot people ended hospital. Actually it’s 

“4.2% people *aware* infected COVID *in last 2 weeks.”

We talking 50 positive tests town 1200 people. Yeah helped America secure first vaccines record time. 

There definitely could done blame virus came China collaboration lied bad stupid. It’s like someone blaming Biden car accident road Canada didn’t pass infrastructure bill yet. class too!

Friday 13th March. gone school (almost) 4 years point, none us idea day would become. one teacher upfront going on, though, spoke thought. honest us, told us actually getting sent home, ""then God knows when, IF, we're coming back."" last minutes, started put personal belongings large bag take home him. 

We said him, ""No way that's gonna happen, would crazy! I'm sure we'll back time graduation.""

Sorry, read: 

""Bolsonaro files lawsuit Supreme Court Congress **for** law granting compensation healthcare workers incapacitated due covid-19 pandemic."" Oh come on, thought could kill anything guns. Even covid virus. realize don’t believe that, right?

Gotta make shit fight dumbass claims.  Thank additional info doubt it, say need photo vaccination card. easy find online? live parish barely 30% vaccinated.  Great argument! immunocompromised tell first shot? confirm. youngest 37 years old told doctor grandma years baby. Yeah, mean, okay. always people understand science process. Much like climate change, vaccination believed disbelieved.

Also, source ""almost everyone"" staying put two weeks? realize ""flatten curve"" means ""decrease stress hospital system"" ""end covid"", right? 

What goalposts moved? moved? moved? whom? Thanks. agree you, even then, sure next seasonal flu especially deadly children? experts saying next flu mutation could worst one yet.

I wish better solution, think best close schools winter months out, better way dealing airborne pathogens. may even decades now. 

I see that's even controversial opinion, unless someone willing sacrifice lives countless innocent children. expected flatter curve

By whispering sweet nothings ear? Right! 

Because careless fat people infecting people fat, making fat, thereby filling ERs fat people infect people waiting room “fat” waiting fix dislocated shoulder.

Because thing, right? Found land whale. Ramen dehydrate tf you, packets full sodium  NYC here, yes homeschooling year also. space kids far enough even mask mandates. two nieces got delta covid really sick one may heart problems. willing risk long term health problems kids. We'll wait till vaccine.  ranks Vatican canceling Easter, Saudi Arabia canceling hajj, Ireland canceling Saint Patrick's day buy bulk 20 cents pack, buy prison $1.20 pack. art inmates got paid noodles (ramen), would pass antivaxer played it. Conservatives: ""see told control."" right, still get even we’re vaccinated. It’s great won’t get seriously ill it, also don’t want get all. I'm SAH dad. 25 years. next strain comes 3 months later, we're back shutdown mode. Immunity makes difference though. Oregon's population (57.5%) fully vaccinated. Vaccine efficacy hospitalization delta 93%.

So vaccinated people required mask outdoors even though odds transmission lower risk severe disease already mitigated immunization.  tell you. say that, trying understand point. We're talking Delta variant affects kids, start talking grandparents. point? Getting next 50% vaccinated going impossible. Agreed agree, honestly shocked got one fast, let alone multiple. Misery loves company.  going work regard weaning vaccine efficacy. guess we’re going get shots every six months?  someone lost track time, October month change away, holy shit  mean fact got vaccines effective soon pretty much miracle.  Good luck! wish vaccinated family members housemates sincere hope accidents medical emergencies requiring treatment anytime soon.

(A friend friend Texas told us brother lost two fingers saw accident. Hospital wouldn’t even attempt reattach nonessential surgery. Everything won’t kill fast denied.) family America Europe UK, you’ll see never? people never able visit countries again?   Happy new Governor already! Uh, 3% risk death? knows. hospital better home sure. ICU? intubated? either good signs. friend double pneumonia years back 60s came through, sucked.

And yes, said vaccinated better though true people die unvaccinated true people unvaccinated die. Omg yes! They’re worst. It’s even delay bothers me, it’s lack communication it. agree obesity burden healthcare system resources could used elsewhere? clear I’m trying blame overweight people, one million straws camels back. brought comparison I’m baffled Reddit calling hospitalized people thrown condition preventable. one specific condition. 

This topic since mentioned work healthcare, widespread easy implement response overburdened hospitals? Haven’t local regional hospitals overwhelmed flus past years huge red flag higher ups? impossible? “Spring?! sabotage progress!” - anti-vaxxers READY RUMBLEEEEEE (mom 1, 3 5 year old. Bring shots, bitches!) guess overlap people private health insurance people unvaccinated probably pretty small.

It’s educated, successful people- part- refusing vaccines. It’s uneducated, economically disadvantaged. People likely didn’t health insurance begin with. Good Bot, nice date calculations! get vaccinated worry getting test. least sue drunk driver

Great point! Something looking thought of. read layout railroad towns? I’d link weren’t mobile google “t town railroad” able find links. I've heard people saying feel like sinus infection. Less coughing, etc. Interesting note, many reports 'long haulers' getting vaccine find symptoms ultimately end greatly dissipate. Need data here....   grateful right nothing Texas near me. assumed. wanted make sure wasn’t using key word. 90% epidemiologists surveyed believe COVID eventually become endemic. endemic, variants inevitable.

We've eradicated one virus human history, took 100 years concentrated effort that. COVID's stay.  Dust. Wind. Depression.

Guess I’m little sick part loves West Texas always will. also vaguely remember something in-demand ramen Orange New Black. Right, it’s ridiculous. 

My unvaccinated grandmother told me, “But history teacher got covid fine.”

Well yeah, 10 year old cousin experienced terrible long covid months meanwhile 98 year old woman hospice know tested positive covid completely asymptotic. virus crazy unpredictable. Get vaccinated people! agree mostly you. able eradicate SARS-CoV-2 fact animal reservoirs.

If friends fully vaccinated (and there's nobody else around) wear mask (and healthy). going grocery store there's poor ventilation many unvaccinated people different story. wear mask.

We really need LOT population vaccinated. Especially children spread SARS effectively adults. People wonder many cases now. truth Delta variant super virus something like that. 48% public **unvaccinated**^(1). unvaccinated people decided go partying like tomorrow restrictions lifted. Even though still thousands cases reported everyday. moment though masks social distancing need sad truth. mean lock-downs btw.

And United States: need change deal disease culture. **NEED** go somewhere flu/common cold (like grocery store, pharmacy, doctors office on) wear mask distance yourself. annoying people care spread potentially dangerous annoying virus.

Are one crazy conspiracy theorists thinks safe effective medical treatments COVID-19 money-grab? Every case tracked... ok  right. fauci telling people wear masks trump repeat stupid. 

Oh well might pandemic year 2 atleast people panic buy masks!!

It's like people could used cloth anything else. 

It's like common sense sneeze shirt elbow pre-covid anything... Yup, vaccinations, cause helped Delta varient showed primarily heavily vaccinated areas...

Not saying he's wrong, saying add happened... Well, Covid isn’t bad guess. dissatisfaction caused gap people's expectations reality.

Yeah. know many people thought vaccine=COVID over. kept masks CDC lifted restrictions May, friends extended family like ""why?"" said need data vaccine operates wild among wider population time. felt confident generally prevents hospitatlizations death, expectations low. Luckily, city majority take masks either, we've hit less delta compared places. hear stories friends places... also know number people who've breakthrough cases, they're shocked angry like vaccine ""failed"" somehow. told vaccine miracle problem solver. one (critical) line defense way soon return 2019 behavior attitudes, even half wear cloth masks (KF94s/N95s/KN9s widely available now) chin/nose, go crowded indoor events hours, suddenly wonder caught COVID? live lives, unrealistic expect lives two years ago. 

I'm increasingly starting believe society going get pandemic old-fashioned, hard way prior pandemics, that's shame. But… but… Trump gone?!?

People didn’t seem get Trump symptom, root cause, much bigger issue country. Great idea. stop there. general let’s fat people, smokers, drug addics high stakes sides, sides lot lose.

Disney can't move Disney World state, De Santis totally leverage apply.

I suspect De Santis going back down, cause want fight.

But wanted take Disney, could:

* Investigate number (probably) illegal labor practices Disney.
* Pull back generous tax benefits state offers Disney. instance Disney set get almost $600 million tax breaks state Florida next 20 years, one new facility Disney building. Take another look peculiar ""Disney exemptions"" various laws. instance, Florida passed big ""anti big tech"" law exempted ""company owns operates theme park entertainment complex"" - without exemption, Disney+ could face fines/investigations law, could quite costly. laws similarly exempt Disney rules companies follow Florida.
* Reform zoning / height limit / ride safety laws. expert this, seems savvy enough, could write law forces Disney tear / retrofit certain rides, maybe make really expensive operate. bunch performative bullshit. would never comply this. Source? misunderstood advice. convenient excuse. I-O! them? Well goes winter US. mean party, right? one special nicknames leader one denigrate members of? That’d better question person’s doctors. It’ll depend individual person, care they’re receiving, whether secondary infections, etc. last mortality rate 50+ saw something like 5% - older data, I’m sure it’s accurate now. hit like mack truck, viruses that. vaccinated, expect move thru quickly. rest positive, know signs watch might indicate medical care needed. OTCs friend meantime. hope feel better soon.  heard before? Yeah dude, dream. Lol. point… shit, might well pray. already it, it’s late anything else. That's thieves general, nothing stealing. get news OANN? Yeah supposed sarcastic know school back session covid running rampant hard find covid test Georgia.

I feeling little sick today think allergies stuffed nose sore throat diarrhea think unrelated. thought might try get test sure, despite vaccinated. Nope! Can't find appointment within 30 miles Monday. decided skip gym see feel tomorrow.

My mom feeling really sick though, 101 degree fever headache diarrhea. rural Georgia. Can't find test Friday. going try make 2 miles urgent care center tomorrow open see get tested, receptionist advised. 70 (and vaccinated, wears masks -- though go eat last Thursday wear mask eating) though there's lot things covid really get tested case.  Fauci pathological liar he’s last person I’d listen concerning health family it’s PRIVATE BUSINESS, censor whatever want. Freedom speech applies gov. Go start shouting random conspiracy nonsense random small business see long tolerate it. can't decide whether feel relief might mean vaccinated inmates feel sadness shame conditions handling prisons. Wait...people hesistant HPV vaccine took ten years enough.. DOOMED civilization Good. willfully unvaccinated chosen fate refusing protect themselves. embryonic treatment? Spoofer. Got 3rd Moderna. Sore arm fatigue. Nothing happened still school could ever remotely classified one best moments life. life began day graduated. Sorry, kids getting extremely sick, affect them.

If did, they'd first get vaccinated. Typical federal government nonsense.  


Right, let's try thing work first time again. Surely, it'll work time things super bad.  


You're certainly clever one, Dr. Fauci. would without you? did, would mild. stress. Let vaccine work magic. Dont drive car eat veges. It’s extra frightening realize one educated areas United States. Bad title. fault, OP. got super excited Tyson employees myself. Isn’t slippery slope argument anti-vaxxers use mandates restrictions? least 3 strains (delta, lambda, new one Miami) notable concern according Mayo Clinic grandrounds. It’s good mode look see different strains interact looks reinfect individuals infected different strain. Though wish accurate testing specify strain folks infected better data. wife said something taste Columbia English called America, that's everywhere. Lots people rural south getting live bubbles oblivious posting covid fake facebook echo chambers. lot need good reality check. Unfortunately getting good daycare isn’t easy, high demand low supply. usually pay effectively non-refundable deposit get kid waitlist hope get in. person said they’d waitlist year, likely paid deposit vaccine. Going back low supply bit good daycares, there’s probably lot options unless they’re able wait another year plus get another daycare. it’s choice keeping job daycare, that’s pretty tough spot, lot sympathy predicament. 

I definitely think put whatever pressure daycare ensure anyone might contact kid vaccinated bare minimum mask policy place strictly adhered to. options maybe limited well.  I'm kind hoping coronavirus turns zombie virus culls big numbers. option seems catastrophy Like HEPA filters? cause issues HVAC systems designed them. terms surfaces touchscreens, fomite transmission covid relatively low risk. United States could literally fire...every state fire.....still 50% (+/-) American citizens would agree call fire department. way reach 85-90. FDA doesn’t want repeat issue earlier summer something like elevated risk myocarditis vaccine isn’t detected EUA already granted mass vaccinations already started.

Despite fact risk low (lower risk myocarditis COVID-19 even) still causes people question safety vaccine issues aren’t caught early trials communicated effectively front. 

I know lot people clamoring kid vaccines guess it’s actually going tough sell parents vaccine young kids, already see 12-15 range. hiccup rollout vaccines 5-11 year olds could tank whole thing. saw quite examples r/rareinsults there. require boosters though. COVID vax needing quickly people refusing get vaccinated all, giving virus avenues propagate. Isn’t risk?  True thats entirely unexpected strong indication problem. Periods ""substantially"" altered many aspects life. even assume every case related vaccine effects quite likely side effect immune response vaccine periods return relitive normalcy without effecting reproductive health.

We often forget sick substantially effect women's periods. natural response often overlooked public discussions health. wonderful news!!! MANDATE VACCINE Oh god! hope okay, hope kid gonna okay! Thats seriously crazy shit. People who're easily swayed *science* shouldnt really allowed say whole damn state- especially state like Florida. suspect covid pregnant beginning pandemic mitigation vaccines couldn’t get tested. I’ll never know not. child born small 4 lbs explanation full term healthy. suspect got covid may affected growth. almost died nicu she’s one year happy healthy. can’t grateful nurses doctors saved life. even 10 years ago may made it. one ever suggested navigating pandemic easy. That's exactly govt safety nets health care systems make recommendations, mandates, careful select put people charge educational systems. always need competent people afraid follow science use funding, things like pop unexpectedly moment. wanting things they've always obviously work. Yes, make conform... marketed way though. Healthy individuals get ""discount"" live unhealthy lives habits. Like we, people Reddit, use sexual functions anyway effect economy like closing things does.

Mask mandates absolutely negative effects businesses, though, albeit less lockdown.  Thanks. I’m sure that’s network insurance heard good things place. way perpetual lockdown! majority population vaccinated, Jacinda seems concerned locking people up. Pathetic vaccine rollout. Imagine side effect. Yikes. choked laughing this. Vaccination passports funny thing say willingly fully vaccinated person. ramping evidence vaccination super effective testing positive/being infectious/developing minor symptoms, makes less less sense allow vaccinated people somewhere without precautions anyway.

It may make somewhat less sense before, still makes enough sense implement. starters, governments' primary goal public health measures always prevent healthcare system becoming overwhelmed and, purpose, vaccines still highly effective. personally agree used sole justification, many effects even mild asymptomatic infections personally devastating, going get much better governments.

Vaccine mandates serve dual purpose reducing viral presence community among vaccinated populations, also become self-defeating incentivizing vaccination; say, vaccine mandates convince enough people get vaccinated get us close 100% uptake, vaccine mandates longer needed.

It's worth noting epicenter continent (yes, North America) months ago province ship ICU patients third wave. really, *really* bad here. horrific second third wave. still relatively fresh everyone's minds modeling released yesterday predicts even *worse* scenario, despite 65% fully vaccinated. We're province 1.4m, even rate expected reach nearly 71% coming weeks (assuming first-dosers get second dose), still leaves 400k people zero doses. There's reality allowing delta rip 400k people (plus probably 150k-200k breakthroughs) end disaster. case rates lowest outside territories atlantic provinces again, time strike get ahead it. seems going two extreme protracted crises may finally pulled leaders' collective heads specifically blocking people going somewhere die (the field vaccines really shine)... sure want tax money spent that.

That's oversimplification. ""they die,"" could become part tsunami flood healthcare system without it. suggest increasing healthcare capacity: healthcare system world scale quickly enough handle delta surge, matter much money throw it, especially *everyone* dealing surge simultaneously can't push pull resources regions. viable action preemptive. Outdoor transmission substantive risk.  guy absolute fucking idiot. Antivaxxers strike again. math dropped 10% countries' level, 9% countries' level?

Give break. global pandemic, everyone suffers. sad education something covid alone responsible for. None parent-note counties anymore. Orange County made switch. Gervais, Oregon = Jer-VASE, according internet, I'm sure I've heard called JER-viss. know. That's whole joke comment. important. Even adult population top percentage world measuring vaccination percent. course losing immunity majority vaccinated long time ago MIGHT help: disclosure, waiting information getting vaccine. I'm anti vax, weary vaccine comes quickly (albeit, attempts coronavirus vaccine around longer) one many people taking. missed long-term effects, would behoove us population vaccinated. know pro-vaccine echo chamber, however, downvote will. Anyway, show link tell body wishes leave alone afterwards? Trust he'll make decision that, may make uncomfortable, he'll comfortable with. Quite true.

I'm glad see jail time, note plead guilty felony count. Depends state. Florida answer no. Hospitals Indianapolis habit replacing nurses 10 years experience. systematically pushed field replaced new, cheap, inexperienced nurses. Perhaps shortage would manageable experienced, trained nurses valued retained. 15 percent United States population age 12, qualify take vaccine. people can't take religious medical reasons. Based alone, can't possibly get 85% least here. vaccine treatments knowledge available, can't begin fathom stupidity created this: admitted *anything* vaccinated treated first. Thay danger others. Even covid, refuse wear mask hospital, maybe can't wear mask depending medical condition. Doctors allowed treat treat vaccinated people. wouldn’t call stupid. Especially since 300,000 people refusing get vaccinated overwhelming hospitals creating unsafe situations rest us weren’t pathetic cowardly got vaccinated. would say it’s last ditch effort try stave emergency created stupidity. It’s sheer insanity, it’s absolutely ridiculous wearing piece cloth nose mouth become huge political schism. idiot trump wannabe governor threatened withhold funding school tries implement mask rules. School started August 10, one kids already spend week home quarantined due contact. absolute madness. chance Labcorp quantitative test? friends got last month get sample ""normal"" ranges antibodies amongst us. variation pretty crazy even amongst people 2 mRNA shots around time. Well, expect refund drinking alcohol, then, counter overweight!

I get uneasy talk different prices health care that. know already smokers I'm imagining 100-point survey determine price based lifestyle risks. Obese? Drink alcohol? Drive 10,000 miles year? Gotten speeding ticket? Etc, etc., etc. Obesity risk people's *health*, *money*. still part discussion around universal healthcare, comparable COVID situation. Yeah .. sure bro. . frog waterproof ass?  3.6 roetgens, great, terrible Well that's pretty obvious why. Uruguay 3.11 million population Brazil 211 million. 

That means Brazil vaccinated around 56 million people almost 20 times population Uruguay. 

No disrespect effort country doing. realize wholly anecdotal, conceived *so fast* second COVID shot, almost startling effective was. bought bunch Conceive+ aids shortly beforehand...

I experience altered periods (basically second full-blown period barely week first ended). clue bearing conception. know, could've actually 'boost' needed. bother, look EU documents EMA, already German. Good Delta! Maybe convince science deniers get vaccinated. /u/sryth88 response wrong. ACA prevent ACA compliant plans. Delta Airlines self-insured comply ACA regulations. ACA compliant plans cannot charge based health status except smoking status. Jacque one outspoken lawmakers COVID-19 vaccine mandates authored legislation would bar government officials business owners requiring Wisconsinites vaccinated COVID-19 show proof vaccination access services.

No isn't. Sorry, let’s make confusing. Delta variant airline that’s going charge unvaccinated employees higher monthly insurance rate due Delta variant COVID, Delta variant causing insurance rates increase patients work airline variant Delta? Don’t worry folks, confusing situation I’ll clear everybody involved! Time start confiscating icecream trucks. Thank Dr. Cookiedough, lesson viral transmission vectors. god tho?

Humans invented lots them. kids already harmed return classes precautions taking place. give damn shot. One important parts Bible religious people conveniently forget is: “love thy neighbor”. They’re busy getting high self-righteousness completely ignore existing world around them. 'The former' would obesity, diabetes. diabetes genetic lot type 2 diabetes lifestyle-influenced.  America, Fuck YEAH! brother finally decided get vaxxed order go concert. dumb come something inconsequential, sorts mandates help get people vaccinated. people obscenely obstinate?

Thankfully Australia *is* going route, western countries Europe proven effective way. weaning vaccine efficacy

To prevent spread. 

The vaccines always designed intent mitigate hospitalizations due COVID. fact also prevent spread happy additional effect. vaccines jobs spectacularly well look rate vaccinated individuals hospitalized versus unvaccinated. sign part vaccine waning efficacy.

Additionally, even without booster, still less likely transmit Delta fully vaccinated versus someone not.

Yeah, friend similar case, healthy 25 y/o, older relatives vaccinated younger sister got vaccine got dirty fever couple days, prefers risk covid big chance asymptomatic rather suffering side effects. mean technically could happen, really unlikely. still tell get shot understand thinks like that. think second companies use practice loophole try get money people pre-existing conditions, paying attention last 10 years.

America weaker virus control people divided. new cold wars internet.  Take governors mansion. Interesting thoughts, compelling chart long last, think back normal. waiting current spike ebb maybe we'll get another taste pseudo normalcy next big variant scare wave. 

Vaccinations going up, great, soon we'll need boosters entirely reconfigured vaccines. virus going always outpace us fear unless gov takes heavy hand somehow forces people get vaccinated/boosted time. needs global too... Well hey, ever want nerd out, I'm ears!  sad part people side argument claiming inflating numbers, reality under-reporting. tell story: anti vaxer city told wasn’t letting college age kids get vaccine. Reason 2 months got hers, stopped periods hasn’t one since. PLOT TWIST: SHES 48. Scary part she’s RN. hell wrong people good, all.  worry tremendously unvaccinated kids despite fact I'm lucky enough send school district mask mandate every mitigation strategy CDC recommended. 

Our district offered virtual year sign-up cut ended June. Everything looked pretty damn good back June.  plan right watch numbers district like hawk things get high I'm going (try least) demand allowed revisit virtual sign-up.  

Our district started Monday today 5 positive cases, district wide. Obviously ideal they're blowing away districts mitigations. They'll anything addict people sugar. sure. recent shift quadrivalent vaccines seem significant tradeoff far know. know technical limitations, safety concerns, economic calculation. I'd imagine 20+ overkill though. 

From understanding, two common subtypes influenza 2 lineages influenza B (which covered quadrivalent vaccine). Flu subtypes people think hear flu (but pretty similar epidemiological properties) names like H1N1, describe two different surface proteins. H protein 18 numbered versions N 11. commonly found humans - two covered vaccine. Still been! Well made bail end. followers probably thought martyr, targeted government part cover 

Sounds stupid timeline, really think kind misunderstanding - think said ""unvaccinated allowed in"", meant ""looks like vaccinated significantly better public picture"". 


Problem last time checked vaccines reduced chances become case something like 3x. downward progress - lower lower numbers collect data, recent stats Israel percent vaccinated among population among new cases looks even worse. two get closer, reasons allow something specifically vaccinated dwindle.  


The whole system, surface, ""you're allowed get back normal life we've told you"". going case soon. already perceived many like ""if told - going punished"" - sides fence. I'm concerned slippery slope too. I'm vaccinated def anti-vax we're headed toward future a-la-carte checklist every ""risky"" activity engage forced complete get covered. That's interesting read, thank you. bet Florida list read article, relation companies ""healthy lifestyle"" stuff now, reward people take part (rather punishing) reduce premium (probably described). remember reading something can't punish you, reward you. Likewise, imagine concept. realize started back up. 5.1 episode 1..... fucking yikes. excluding pre existing conditions.

It's incentivizing choices reduce costs.

And that's nothing new. smoking, losing weight choices factored costs. even simple free vaccine. like… equal parts really good really underwhelming.

We need facilities need WAYYYY more. Europe paying facilities made. Yeah, way FLORIDA TEXAS this. Ive heard cases. current insurance provider checks Tobacco use. Yeah I’m sure ACA anything it. It’s employer sponsored. already number choice related ""conditions"" smoking, mixed biometrics (high blood pressure, high cholesterol etc), even yearly physical. way since least ACA passed, potentially longer (personal experience dates 2009).

They done discounts instead penalties, presumably upping employer subsidy base premium still same.  countering cynical view we'll get control years never. work? entire sub Reddit seems pointless now. 0 new news. reports terrible statistics over.

My pitchfork ready Closer 70% - still leaves lot idiots downstate would think natural byproduct age group largely vaccine available, serves proof vaccines work. Masks schools start, really effective enough own. need protocols place, like cohorting, distancing, testing. district dropped everything masks. trick put kid shoulders put long trench coat top yourself. Don’t mind tiny arms people. Hate hear that. Even initial doses provide protection severe outcomes least. 

Don’t quit trying though. may able talk it. Urgent care Turns NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) paid shutdowns, contract tracing, mask mandates work. American federal government needs start implementing them, yesterday.    CDC made full list ingredients available Send link. Honest question:

Why think 70% table? Right biggest barrier ineligible groups.

Once everyone vaccinated pretty easily get there. Might even get 5-12 elgible. delta spread much vaccinated unvaccinated

**FALSE**. Breakthrough infections among vaccinated people far less likely infections unvaccinated people. everyone vaccinated virus would die out. That's proper herd immunity does. stop infections, makes infrequent enough R0 falls 1.

Stop spreading lies, Russian bot. Yeah Chicago like 80% Illinois  I’m US appears companies vaccine mandates. Ah, fuck. Thanks info. crushed hope ever going able exit shit- carousel ride around circles forever piles shit shit on, thanks info. went urgent health center. giving much credit, likely called 911 911 told call poison control gave number haha town Celebration Disney-owned?

Comparing covid traffic accidents tired argument.

By definition animal virus made leap humans. 

Let’s say raising livestock. Would people eat less meat? Doubt it. Would people pay sanitary meat? That’s hard bet make.

TEMPORARILY also many things cause change cycle including stress, sickness, diet change, medication, weight loss gain etc. Toyota one example. 

How matter manufacturer use? Even use hypothetical made car manufacturer, basic critical skills pick inferences. work? expected variants happen. literally biology works. Everything happened predictable payed attention.

No don't. think I'm priority brings next question. Money.

Money matter. course make money influences decisions laws. But, what's better making money vaccines business usual. government wants people get back work, shop, stop worrying getting sick. Hear again, government wants normalcy least illusion keep making money. Vaccines best way this, turn need effective, means slightly backwards sick way, yes, health/ability return normal priority.

Have thought that? Honest question. still getting mRNA booster Anectdata donate blood Red Cross been, recently, covid tests donations. one donation post-Moderna flagged specifically passing one two tests likely indicated vaccinated individual. Previous donations vaccination plain negative covid. stopped testing next donation.

Again, personal anectdote [Red Cross talks differences antibodies 2 types tests are/were using. **Q: different COVID-19 antibodies develop exposure virus antibodies develop reaction **A:** Antibodies individual produces they’ve exposed virus slightly different antibodies individual produces they’ve vaccinated. individual infected virus, produce antibodies multiple regions virus. Red Cross, use two antibody tests generate results blood, platelet plasma donations. One test – Ortho’s total test – detects antibodies spike protein virus. detects antibodies different protein virus called nucleocapsid protein. donor COVID-19 vaccine, generate antibody spike protein nucleocapsid protein, occur event COVID-19 infection. I’m genuinely surprised group incentivized get vaccine all. remember meat processing plants big spreaders virus last year, employees forced work closely together, also likely live smaller homes larger family groups. worked chicken factory, would raced get shot first chance got, even meant pay docked. explain joke?   *any* major corporations requiring entry frontline workers vaccinated? 

CVS corporate, pharmacists nurses. Walgreens requiring support offices stores. Walmart HQ stores warehouse workers. Restaurant retail probably cluster due franchising doubt we'll see 100% mandates time soon.

If unvaccinated want work seems like millions jobs work, time being.  Could interesting premise movie, vaccinated people immediately becoming infertile, procreating people unvaccinated. wonder fucked humanity would be?  Ninefold sounds great. wonder long booster last. wouldn’t surprised becomes yearly thing like flu shot. yesterday Uk covid cases 13% last week. declining couple weeks end July starting early august ticking back  Surface transmission incredibly low. Always wash produce that’s good practice even covid. need quarantine items sanitize clothing unless like work medical covid unit basically marinate it.  Prepare get brigaded triggered kiwi’s. simply can’t fathom possibility shit going south. Never seen blind confidence people. Toxic positivity beat covid. Tennessee 🙋🏻‍♀️ wish every time experts talk herd immunity requirements, many people going immunized, would actually get lest somewhat granular specify whether projections take account immunity natural infection.

Roughly 38 million US infected far, CONFIRMED cases. undercounting order magnitudes goes even more. That, combined EVENTUAL vaccination percentage somewhere near \~60% could (COULD) maybe get us ""out this"". I'd probably get Pfizer booster regardless lower dosage. Moderna intends file lower dose boosters still 3x Pfizer dose. 

Inexplicably done phase 1 trials vectored booster, though enough j&amp;j shots anyway. antibodies transfer breast milk actually protect infant coat GI tract. Antibodies cannot transfer GI tract bloodstream humans. Women informed this, misunderstanding prevalent even nurses often wrong. was. They're differentiating though booster dose had, would called third dose original vaccine considered part primary series (this immunocompromised people).

They're also testing different boosters, one original shot got half dosage. mean sit watch govt let place burn down. time move. ""I think also need conversation country thefood lobbies keep much American food utter garbage filledwith sugar 20 different names.""

Are worried covid mutating? fluffy ones downvoting you, point. Lord mercy right. vaccinated spreading virus tiny fraction rate unvaccinated spreading it. Feel free Google numbers.  Assuming vaccinated person unvaccinated person exact odds spreading Covid someone else flat wrong. wonder future variant-targeting boosters able use reduced dosage due pre-existing immune system familiarity pathogen. maybe not, since targeting variant naturally implies teaching immune system recognize something new, reinforcing something already known.

But yeah people follow herd. … Voluntarily wearing masks Covid flu.

It's year half.

You know now, right? good anywhere better people vaccinated. republicans pushing antivax since tax released. ""those us ""

I sure know category placing in. regret saying ""delta ravaged children""? Lol funny say that. third strain actually new discovered Miami, novel wasn’t even given Greek letter name yet. least knowledge. Lord mercy. CDC says vaccinated still spreading disease. vaccinated protect me, protects you. I'm curious know effort going. I've heard zip good now. hope still progressing! Notice also long term account. Remember Reddit shitposting Ron Paul funny cat gifs? teenagers hoping boomers die financially ruin people careers want novel vaccine. True. feel reward people right thing, rather punish wrong Sad read spelled black-and-white, guess lot infectious-disease experts around world suspected quite time. certainly makes sense, given transmissibility delta. Welp! got wanted. thoughts prayers needed. understanding he's responsible medical bills deceased.  Anytime!! Maybe send stealth way drum business, like get bill, heart attack go hospital. Maybe nothing Novavax get around fact body never produce nasal antibodies long. Yeah easy get caught loud people realize people change minds.

I think there's large chunk people held numbers looked really good late last spring looked like realizing can't skate finish backs us got vaccinated earlier year. That's nowhere near obese. Obese starts BMI 30, 25. cases, death negative impact libido. way rest us ever chance returning normalcy know he's gaining, point. can't wait outbreak Sydney control, soon new outbreak states close borders again. Either ok opening active outbreak, they'll never open, need aware that.  Pfizer approved. Moderna still working thru process expected gain full approval within month.  question vaccine safety. seeing numbers Korean news reports healthy people dying vaccine. wonder precaution taking vaccine, ie category people take vaccine?   it’s incredibly hard anything bills. dad died years ago, hospital sent mom bill. Even insurance $200k. obviously couldn’t pay wouldn’t anything.  literally lost house mom declared bankruptcy. physicals body fat percentage. combined much better indicator adverse health possibilities overall truthful face value numbers

This quickly gets us back judging people health condition responsible for. much better ""insulation"" mutations, yes. diminishing returns vaccination terms decreasing infection. course mutates enough efficacy vaccine falls low going issue. think lowest efficacy percentage tested 50%. WELL current vaccines &amp; mutations great, see massive mutation spike protein 85% number falls apart need new vaccine. vaccine worked. Millions eligible receive yet may come surprise given things keep saying, YOU. wish demand vaccines would skyrocket US...

And taught growing proactive far better reactive… yet regards virus many people seem willing take reactive approaches instead proactive ones… Im body size yes. Im obesity, otherwise we'd steady punt obesity decades. obviously factor diet. Thats thing, werent compared now. Whats changed? thought Delta Dental! That's good info. Thanks. sense insurance companies going bankrupt near future expect people pay bills full yup happily pay extra 100 month use nicotine. like tobacco pay insurance.

time chuckle heads like un-vaxxed pay well think ever possible without vaccinating children 12. people actually think this? predicted months ago. brought everybody became legal experts overnight telling obamacare mandate it. Like ive always said, benefits corporations make us it. lets see really afford extra money keep called freedoms. they're replacing experienced staff inexperienced staff save money salaries, I'd say they're going beyond trimming fat, getting muscle. high BMI probably fault. majority society high BMI, probably societal problem; individual.  fuck. knew health care US expensive, still blows mind. expected around 100k course.

But can't use anecdotal data either way. example experienced pregnancy loss.

Those stories dont matter. 5-7 days infection chance correct positive highest. Email uncle They’re going let virus rip kids stock market maintain all-time highs. bipartisan perspective United States, I’m tired pretending otherwise. politician, one, single one supports even temporary lockdown. Again, unvaccinated kids whose progress learning may permanently crippled virus, teachers. 

They’re admit vaccine efficacy wanes, too. Really makes wonder system that’s functionally incapable even barest protections. 

The government sent zero masks students, new hospital constructed since beginning pandemic. privatization hath wrought. Gaze despair. I’m vaccinated, I’m afraid virus unvaccinated. Ive directly exposed multiple times past couple months infected coworkers. Even deadly global pandemic deserve level shade. googled never heard before, found found pretty surprising!

The national cemetery established Civil War grounds Arlington House, previously estate **Mary Anna Custis Lee, great-granddaughter Martha Washington wife Robert E. Lee.**  Santa Clarita Diet. God, that’s depressing. mini staycation planned them, guess I’ll try make sure it’s filled good memories case last. 

But also use Roman Catholic guilt taught child shame going. Capital Regional Medical Center Tallahassee, Fla., terminated contract emergency room physician selling parents mask opt-out letters school children, according *Tallahassee Aug. 22, Florida's Leon County implemented stricter mask mandate requires school children medical exemption forgo masks. Brian Warden, MD, told parents anti-mask website would provide signed medical opt-out letter parents $50. Dr. Warden said signing forms affiliated hospital medical group. Capital Regional Medical's CEO Alan Keesee requested hospital's board directors vote terminate Dr. Warden's contract. ""We act absolute integrity do, expectation providers behave way consistent values,"" CRMC spokeswoman Rachel Stiles told *Tallahassee Democrat* Aug. 24. ""Immediately upon learning physician's actions, began process removing providing services hospital vote, Dr. Warden told *Tallahassee Democrat* provide publication comment. It’s different picture. Total vaccinated population incorporates overall risk infection time period. Whereas %vaccinated total cases gives snapshot effectiveness preventing infection exposed.

They’re valuable. Risk exposure part overall risk evaluation. Coincidence came right Big 10 said COVID affected teams would forfeit games? think not.  Haha oh it’s angers experimental antivirals NEVER get released - stuff like ' DRACO ' antiviral; here's news article 2011: tested worked cold, flu, even Ebola. definitely would work COVID.

Like excuse 'lack funding' - they've literally already shown safe enough could literally change everything.

Its unfortunate could saved much lives released YEARS ago.. Think COVID - MANY many viruses.. least perhaps people I've seen seem apparently working similar exact thing called ' VTose'.

Unlike antibodies that'd coat virus's exterior still infect entirely covered antibodies antibodies may work kinds viruses / mutations - antiviral gets soaked bodies cells detects virus infecting said cell latches onto infection code virus injects cell modifies infection part virus lacing self destruct 'apoptosis' code onto - instead cell looking infection code producing viruses instead starts read code see self destruct code cell proceeds immediately die. cell undergoes 'apoptosis'. antiviral designed go similar trait viruses share start infect - regardless species / mutation.

So imagine antibodies perhaps vaccine immediate antibody dose DRACO antiviral last line defense -just case virus get antibodies. There's reason practice banned health insurance. think kill 10% population health problems? kill everyone childhood diabetes? Cancer? Asthma? refuse give healthcare unless they're really rich? that's happens use formula health insurance, practice banned.

Most things drive health care costs things people minimal control over. Charging people unreasonable rates alive health problems horribly unethical practice.

So Delta? specific concerns whether give lasting protection due potentially shorter incubation period.

Yet, many scientists acknowledged (through careful analysis data) efficacy Delta lower original strains. still protective hospitalization infection, sky high rates saw DeSantis deserves everything gets almost science keeps changing new data, science care beliefs happening change time, science care beliefs based reality things constantly change scientific approach needs adjust new data comes affects currently accepted truth(there never really truth though, science fluid ever growing data adjust understanding state mind based data).

Science always welcome data, people engraved beliefs not, set stance hold stance matter new data disproves stance

This Wednesday morning, Ministry Health (Minsal) reported 392 new cases covid-19 Chile, somewhat higher 387 infections yesterday, lowest 16 months.

From data day, 279 patients classified symptomatic 85 asymptomatic.

""Thirteen regions decrease cases last seven days 14 14 days,"" explained Minister Health (s), Paula Daza.

""The variation new confirmed cases national level -19% -27% comparison seven 14 days, respectively,"" added Daza.

The Metropolitan region one cases , 213, 54.33% total. end spectrum Magellan, zero PCR antigen diagnoses.

However, total number people active stage disease went 4,423 4,115 , another minimum pandemic.

**Positivity keeps falling**

At time, Government reported PCR positivity set 0.98% analyzing 31,128 tests coronavirus.

It first time indicator fallen 1% since records, reaching lowest value entire health crisis .

The regions scored 1% PCR positivity Magallanes (0%), Arica Parinacota (0.24%), Atacama (0.25%), Antofagasta (0.36%), Tarapacá (0.41%) , Los Lagos (0.62%), Coquimbo (0.81%), Ñuble (0.81%), La Araucanía (0.81%) Bío Bío (0.90%).

If antigen tests added PCR test, balance Wednesday included study results 38,029 samples.

**ICU deaths**

Currently, integrated system 3,086 enabled critical beds, 563 free, leaves occupancy 81.75% .

There 796 hospitalized patients covid-19, 609 connected mechanical ventilation (76.51%).

The two age groups represent highest occupancy group aged 60 69 years (30.28%) 70 (30.04%).

In terms deaths, Department Health Statistics Information (DEIS) added 17 deaths associated virus.

Thus, total number deaths pandemic reached 36,718. NY it’s safe assume nearly everyone fudged numbers.

I bet 1 million deaths country alone.

""METHODS
From December 14, 2020, February 28, 2021, used data “v-safe vaccination health checker” surveillance system, v-safe pregnancy registry, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) characterize initial safety mRNA Covid-19 vaccines pregnant persons.

RESULTS
A total 35,691 v-safe participants 16 54 years age identified pregnant. Injection-site pain reported frequently among pregnant persons among nonpregnant women, whereas headache, myalgia, chills, fever reported less frequently. Among 3958 participants enrolled v-safe pregnancy registry, 827 completed pregnancy, 115 (13.9%) resulted pregnancy loss 712 (86.1%) resulted live birth (mostly among participants vaccination third trimester). Adverse neonatal outcomes included preterm birth (in 9.4%) small size gestational age (in 3.2%); neonatal deaths reported. Although directly comparable, calculated proportions adverse pregnancy neonatal outcomes persons vaccinated Covid-19 completed pregnancy similar incidences reported studies involving pregnant women conducted Covid-19 pandemic. Among 221 pregnancy-related adverse events reported VAERS, frequently reported event spontaneous abortion (46 cases).

CONCLUSIONS
Preliminary findings show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up large numbers women vaccinated earlier pregnancy, necessary inform maternal, pregnancy, infant outcomes.

more link  52% people vaccinated matters. We’d need like 90-95% people 12+ get stands 13-14% country minimum ineligible get vaccinated FDA approval comes 0-12  stuff mentioned great execute limited funding? It’s complex situation. think open Australia, ie states hospitality still full swing etc, allowed see Sydney looks like 80% committing join there.

There's need commit - sensible thresholds could ""once Sydney peaked, and/or back hundreds cases per day"" ""until everyone wants vaccinated been"". Currently there's still queues weeks long, everywhere country.

What's gained locking percentage must open Sydney, close hospitality / introduce mask orders, today?  clever tactic. Cast blame toward government policies want impose employees avoid blowback. Unfortunately, lie. doubt $200 go away instead everyone else going see premiums increase amount months. mean Obamacare literally got rid ability insurers rate based pre-existing conditions go guess. Absolutely hysterical party ""fat smokers diabetes charged healthy person age"" crowd took complete u-turn want's financially ruin people refusing vaccine.

Keep telling great freeing socialism tho haha. Well funny say lol folks helping gather data lab model, clinical research model well. Public health underappreciated field, play pivotal role analyzing effect novel maladies towards general population low end right ballpark, lowest costs. upper end would $3M range. 

Different situations, different years, different treatments going on, added daughter's 2 weeks NICU cost $1.1 $1.4M - range medical billing enigma way keep straight, categorize it, even put chronological order. clue actually happened either. insurance though, seeing insurance prices. likely uninsured people would see entirely different numbers. Junk logic.  overweight drug addict complex diseases contagious others easily preventable simple vaccine. Yup, use stick approach. South peaking guess that's good, waste life! hope unvaccinated survivors wave finally get vaccinated help stop next one. Yeah, go states DHHR website read. need links 50, manage? statement incorrect. Please give exact numbers explain this. height, weight, body fat percentage gets there? assume mean women since said 30%?
Also, I’ve never heard realistic public health professionals suggest use body fat percentage measuring population scale practical. mean, guess part Herrenvolk is, decent amount time.

Train new people, find raw materials pay greater production, pay equipment made. take long time start now. here's situation, fully Vaccinated J&amp;J vaccine several months ago. wife got first dose Prizer last Thursday. found later day directly exposed person tested positive. sick (maybe sinus infection) scheduled get tested later today. question happens come back positive got first dose immediately exposed me?

If virus replicating vaccinated person possibility there....for much dreaded variant form. Better safe sorry. country wearing masks outdoors year including jogging one complaining. Maybe country difficult without crying. clarify - there's currently two Australia's.

The locked Australia, Sydney/Melbourne.

The open Australia, life unencumbered, can't enter locked areas. Nightclubs, masks, covid, hospital issues, etc.

The current plan was, 80% states open other. road, open world - maybe everyone wants vaccine one. now, there's still long queues.

Since then, Sydney outbreak happened, never really tried get back zero. Or, did, everything wrong.

The PM saying moment hit threshold, open Australia open borders closed Australia. normalise restrictions, capacity limits, close nightclubs surge past, mask orders - whatever looks like, still vaguely defined moment.

Those state premiers saying ""give us bit time see Sydney looks 80%, see we're opening to, committing now"". PM says no, commit now. why? What's gaining this?    true.

Has also talked incompetence lies health experts (CDC/FDA) contributing factor? People arent going trust CDC CDC deliberately lies masks preserve healthcare workers.

Has addressed terrible policy decisions politicians ranging Trump Cuomo leading 10s thousands preventable deaths?

Has addressed absolute raftload elites caught flouting safety protocols told us necessary? Absolutely disastrous public trust.

I dont want blaming trolls Facebook easy scapegoat cop out. Every level failed here, presidents governors CDC/FDA Fauci.

Ummm, ""God"" nailed cross...do really think wear mask? point declared incompetent, guardians would get vaccinated so... [This clear things up.

You're talking arse. I'll take gallon. Yes, one testing called mRNA 1273.651. Revealed subtly latest investor press release (Page 28):  super optimistic prediction. hope it'll hold seeing Australia handled Covid far, I'm still sceptic. Um, nope. realistic really already seeing hundreds thousands breakthru cases  It’s big deal. jog 4 miles time mask on.

How could something evolutionarily disadvantageous take over?  Neither examples complex biological structures. think got wrong, reporting deaths following vaccine, even can't verify death caused vaccine. guess question becomes breakthrough infections become ""escape"" infections. already know Delta notable transmission levels vaccinated populations. 

What would consider variant move silently vaccinated populations kill unvaccinated immunocompromised individuals? Silver linings Delta annoyingly successful, ha ha.   Hawaii fucked? Taiwan much?

Forty-one deaths happened Aug. 19 Aug. 23. 70 deaths occurred June 25 Aug. 20 identified death highest total deaths we've date far pandemic,"" said state epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers.  Enjoy schadenfreude isn’t big statement. First off, likelihood happening actually fairly low. spike protein makes COVID infectious. spike protein mRNA vaccine uses train immune system. 

So variant fully bypasses COVID would require vastly different method attach cells. 

Second, mRNA production assembly line pat. COVID came out. mRNA vaccines pipe dream. Now, digitally transmit RNA code virus INSTANTLY start vaccine. 

Also, distribution networks methodology pat. We’ve already. learned mRNA vaccines don’t actually require crazy strict low temp stay viable. 

In short, many ridiculous improvements processes place nowhere near start pandemic. 

mRNA _permanently_ changed future healthcare massive way. start getting multiple deadly strains COVID coming us, foresee installation local community based mRNA facilities get vaccines made locally within two three months variant concern. 

This isn’t 2019. Oh also competent leader charge CDC that’s nice. Mid October makes sense. measure announced mid July, due vacations everyone opportunity get shots immediately afterwards. France essentially closed August, got simply count month. given delay two shots 2 weeks count, think mid October fair.

It would've better announced measures lot sooner, could've taken effect earlier. given situation, current solution OK. Australia never going get pathetic way handling Covid. failed attempt controlling Covid extreme lockdowns vaccinations pushing problem away. 



It's absolutely bonkers sitting country, completely restrictions, seeing people actually think okay people shamed eating fucking outside Australia. Actually number virus infections went down, number mutations copy errors pool would also go down. would cause chances freak variant emerge decrease cover anti-vaccines, although briefly, main message go shine light lots people entrenched unscientific realities. Forgive believing you, haven’t read anything news resembles you’re saying. People lie Reddit time. Yeah, that's viruses work PC game Pandemic. Everyone knows game serious simulation predicted outcome every pandemic ever.

/s Even countries level anti-vax US, hard achieve, vaccines cover 12s. Australia complete udder shit show. Mid october. 
It removed weeks ago though.  Dude, I'm ""looking edge cases"". asking hypothetical.  realize Covid endemic animal reservoir utilize? It’s never going away, want mass vaccinations yet taken us 60 years nearly eradicate Polio, won’t eradicate Covid. Yes they're respectable institutions. college worked retail woman Masters English. supervisor. Verocell refers Sinovac, yet authorised Europe. think chances higher. know 3 younger (under 50) healthy vaccinated people still gotten sick. got sick, pleasent. situations masks we're exposed. 

And yes like car crash, wearing mask like wearing seat belt. odds getting car crash low, mean wear seat belt. fuck around, find out. Normal per-2020 living can't happen borders reopen travel resumes. think ever happen, especially people need keep getting boosters. mostly, entirely credit Biontech. Pfizer essentially shit. provided distribution system. infections still far people chose get vaccinated? vaccine prevent infections 100% time deciding seems kind stupid. scares seems excellent evolving already frighteningly efficient killer. I've 2 times already, last year year. nightmare virus even vaccinated. really really dont want deal ti anymore. super depressing think experience place escape. Yeah, that's terrible situation. republican governors (not Abbott DeSantis) coming around trying convince citizens get vaccinated....but ""previous guy"" got booed rally weekend, governors clammed up.

So looks like GOP leaders would rather kill base become target base's anger.  F Deaths appear going Shall Named invisible death thing /usa/missouri/

But hospitalisations way up? case numbers pretty high sure ... someone town died. looking wife’s FB page full thoughts prayers requests thoughts prayers one mention word vaccine. You’d think least they’d say hey save go get vaccinated 🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️ Good. help Ohio. please stop talking Israel much antivaxxers does? Israel sitting low steady 60% vaccinated population, people first world.


It's absolutely expected we're seeing giant surge cases there. Good news! every province university named, ""University [province]"" though?  know several people work contracted big pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer AstraZeneca. I've heard, Pfizer willing throw money problem fixed, AstraZeneca pedantic absurdly careful patient safety. general, difficult someone turn blind eye, multiple people need read every document that's generated. there's sort misconduct, would coordinated couple people. Yes, thing vaccine-resistant mutation needs outcompete existing strains. Delta seems issue outcompeting finding hosts, even vaccinated populations.  *This* show work! 

(Thank btw).

I see exponential growth there, it’s also inconsistent. two days see jump new cases. (The two days 11 21) despite increasing number tests. 

Also R factor falling last days meaning we’re heading right direction. 

Alright, Dr. Bloomfield said. think bit context keep mind says this:

* testing exploded 10% Auckland tested, seeing numbers showing unfettered spread. 

* vast majority existing cases tracked infection point. 

* currently active case placed facility help isolation provide support. also helped take positive cases general public. 

I’ll say Bloomfield isn’t someone say it’s exponential without facts back up. 

And lastly, thank taking time. learned something post. see point. 

In general, trust Bloomfield. always told us truth, even bad news doesn’t sugarcoat things. idiot neither team. trust judgment PhD this, saying seeing exponential growth, trust him. 

But numbers prove locking right thing do. 


I hope good evening. Lmao, take advice ""experts"", end back square 1, regardless. conjecture based polarising viewpoints, virus 99.8% survivability factor whether vaccinated. Gotta love remaining 30% get vaccine bullshit reason causing health system collapse. 

Does US system properly verifies vaccination status negative test result? really surprising.

You can't give unvaccinated folks amount freedom vaccinated least negative tested people. Tater tots paper plates , thoughts and.... Let's keep context. past 1.5 years, COVID killed 4.45M people worldwide (Wikipedia). world population 7.7 Billion. 6 people per 10,000 worldwide died COVID.

Tragic terrible deaths, yes. hardly apocalyptic. Means vaccine actually stop transmission allows virus time mutate people - hence numbers still going even highly vaccinated countries.

You entitled participate community willingly *actively* endanger. Simple stuff.   sorry. growing tired educating either way.  Watched video, took notes; lotsa good info.

The section reinfection comes clarify, 2.34 factor difference re-infection rates for

* who'd infected subsequently get vaccine
* who'd infected subsequently get vaccine

It course favored subsequently vaxxed, explicitly talk differing reinfection rates folk 'natural' vaccine based immunity. things said, seems previous infections plus vax better either alone, so, I'd bet difference previous infection vax avoiding reinfection smaller 2.34 factor...which good thing little analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

On deadliness reinfection (from new variants), stated lot anecdotal evidence extra deadliness; sadly, provided numbers go on, even guesstimate much deadlier.

&amp;#x200B;

Really great video; thanks again. Except that’s happened smokers. Research definitely lacking natural immunity time. research suggests longer term immunity previous infection outperforms vaccines, want see real world outcomes like vaccines. Yippee, vaccine cheering squad too, mine. report many hundreds thousands deaths caused late, absent inadequate masking, isolation contact tracing programs? different higher rates smokers. 


You undertake actions overall known cost health care industry--and so, us--more money....you pay burden. you’re calling hatred mostly stemming frustration. We’ve dealing pandemic past 18 months now. want end much anybody. vaccination far best route pandemic.

Though point moot obesity pandemic.  Start paying less based information. adjust corporate health insurance premium. I'd say that's cause concern. Yes, 600,000 tested. did. fucking disease vectors. Delta. likely delta self-insures, could bearing costs directly everyone applauding big business cutting workers benefits.

No benefits cut. person's choice. really matter why, change everyone making less less, dumb asses.

Which completely different problem already done people strain health risk.  think would help everyday life take pause mindful say.

Where use phrase ""out goodwill""? additionally, government NZ buy vaccines? Hopefully doesn’t turn 5 still breastfed covid runs long. Haha. looked seeing could discriminate? 200 bucks pretty modest, think.  Yes. expected 60% population vaccinated would enough herd immunity earlier year. Good lord could said better Vaccine receipt health care. Duh good, another aspect consider arm forces stationed world. continue spread everywhere. problem privacy itself, want volunteer personal info that's you, employers rewarding people based individual health stats?

Im pretty sure CDC suggested getting vaccine previously received getting booster shot. allowed put vaccinated COVID patients first triaging? work insurance industry it’s actually common different costs individual based personal behaviors. Insurance always operated way. protects Group insured poor decisions Individual Group. often see impacting smokers (including vaping).

Insurance large company like Delta generally administered Group (assume everything I’m write generally true always). employees Group. Based make-up Group (age, gender, etc), insurance company estimates much costs Group incur year, negotiates employer employer pay annual premium nets profit insurance company. employer uses market power negotiate lower rates. employer passes cost Group. Individual employees Group generally don’t pay cost. job higher costs higher income, well smoking status. 

So, Delta protecting vaccinated individuals Group costs incurred unvaccinated; otherwise, costs entire group could go up. wonderful decision! time goes disparities become apparent, becomes clear *certain* state leaders worked hard keep virus raging long possible. middle winter.. pre-existing condition. 

And allowed this. obese smokers. Regardless plan type it’s trivial achieve net effect charging 200 unvaccinated. **The** Ohio State University.

Likewise, since building muscle requires exercise long period time, heart someone regularly lifts weights stronger healthier exercise alone. conflation weight bad heart gross oversimplification. Fat bad health. Muscle this, many 80+ see average BMI muscle mass?

I've seen lot fat old people. However, elderly struggle maintain muscle mass due decreased testosterone, sleep problems, activity levels. comes cardiovascular health, less (fat muscle).

Everyone, janitors food service people CEO, employee contractor, vaccination card file HR dept employment, severance, terminated effective Nov 16.   Got it. Thanks explaining. garbage ACA ended being, really astronomically better had, completely inexcusable huge segment population forced death beds early unlucky enough medical condition prior getting insurance mean is, receiving reports deaths today, they're labelling announcing 1-2 weeks ago. effect always looks like peaked two weeks ago, reality, that's data that's complete. Yesterday's data still fraction eventually be.

Other states, hand, dump entire total label ""today,"" even though deaths 1-2 weeks ago. effect graph looks like would expect, two weeks behind. Ok. That’s said understanding. idea resorted name calling put downs, you. good point uneven distribution vaccination. live CT 72% *total* population least 1 shot. Alabama 48% total population one shot. That's huge gap, going quite states get near herd immunity whereas others far away. mean, would lawsuits really ground stand on? High five! thought removed parasites though... LMFAO Sadly that's case. pay dad's bills passed. shitty thing deal top losing loved one. one many list. EUA though far understand. like vaccines (prior full approval Pfizer earlier week). Alexa, play ""Stacking Bodies"" Fit King. appreciate that, thank you.

tl;dr Talk lawyer, first foremost. I'm clear exactly, legal perspective, rationale things jointly owned vs. intersects will.

My experience...

My father whole thing was, ""your mother get everything die."" Which, thanks Dad, way plan. 

When dad passed, talked lawyer explained Dad's estate assets held *only* him, can't come house, cars, etc. advised us pay bills came dad's name. surprised well [the guy estate ($500/hr saved us $50k expecting pay without second thought). 

This got Mom hook hospital stays, rehabs, ambulance, even Visa, Mom card account held jointly (Mom even realize this; best communicators/married couple). say, one signed anything accepting financial responsibility dad. every place definitely tried, even subtly.

With dad's 401k, never actually listed mom beneficiary (again, thanks Dad, way plan!) mom paperwork. point paperwork process, actually open estate Carroll County Office Whoever Charge courthouse. estate valued whatever dad's 401k. Turns husband's coworker's wife actually works courthouse office (she handle Dad's estate paperwork, though) like, ""actually, no, 401k grabs"" (I think b/c mom beneficiary; even without Dad naming her, goes spouse default). think Mom explained things correctly first opened estate English first language. amend estate 401k Mom's name got zeroed (Carroll County saw documentation, hiding lying involved). official document ""$0.00"" revised estate value. creditors file estate, there's nothing get.

I entirely understand maybe even explain well say fact went proper channels estate worth $0.00. ""how much house/cars/jewelry worth"" Mom.

FTR: Next ""to do"" list call estate lawyer start working Mom's estate planning. situation different likely involve plan liquidate and/or transfer assets ages clear things name late. think cases, creditors look asset transfers dating back something like 5 years. 

So, yeah, definitely talk lawyer. idea lot will, too. Okay? Using total number vaccinated people denominator doesn’t really paint much picture me. I’m positive vaccines job information reeks “99.8% survival rate!” drivel last year. good point. older coworker shut brought vaccine, open listening doctor. get vaccine work mandated (before chance talk doctor). want hear me. Good. need pay more. Lmfaoo actually hard headed. 



Fuck CDC isn’t don’t listen CDC. 



May ask simple question. 




When CDC said vaccinated people don’t wear mask anymore. 



Would yelling someone wearing mask even though they’re vaccinated? 


How different saying? 


There epidemiologist critiquing CDC decision masks. epidemiologist critiquing CDC 8 month delay today. Ok ever say kiddo country technically passed along estate (or passed inheritance declined) although creditors claim debts whatever financial capacity estate (i. e. heir obliged pay debt his/her money).

Just wondering different USA around world. worker idiocy causing rise expenses, see problem cutting compensation. ballpark ICU $30k day, average gonna $900k-$1M. 
(I work insurance cost living)  every discussion COVID need consider two facts:

1) COVID become endemic.

2) Nearly everyone world get point.

I really wish two facts would stickied conversation matter country in, cost hospital stay high decent facilities staffing.

That's simply false. plenty developed countries bankrupted getting sick. makes sense, can't imagine bodes well hospitals plateau. part ACA makes illegal discriminate based medical choices. example, charge woman 20’s less chooses birth control not.

Incorrect- [Unfortunately ACA allows employers totally remove contraceptives insurance offer. start testing kids, find symptomatic cases invisible before. Plus school started up, causing kids exposed. bikers must kiss mouth! Step 1: attractive must really desperate dredging bottom barrel like that. ultimate efficacy matter now, prevention Hospitalization Death. sorry. stuff toxic prays people's desire find easy solution. That's scary. many work first place. antibodies last.  Sometimes early delivery save baby's life. course, baby grow without mother, also bad outcome child. also can’t get shot 90% chance making skinny. was, company would worth trillions. Obese tend live shorter lives overall healthcare cost less it. Life insurance die earlier. I'm saying either death less impactful person's family. agree you. fatness contagious probably kill me. ""Tell bother reading article commenting, without saying bother reading article commenting."" somebody study it. employer right ask expect receive medical information. That's violation restriction medical professionals hospitals. allowed disclose medical information without permission. says nothing employers organizations requesting disclose something exchange something else. Natural infection gives varied antibodies simply SARS-Cov2 virus multiple antigen sites. Antibodies made spike well nucleocapsid protein. Vaccination provides spike protein antibodies produced against. 

Antibody titers spike seem higher vaccinated individuals compared natural infection. So, probably source confusion vaccination provides anti spike Abs, natural infection provides Abs spike nucleocapsid. Theoretically want antibodies spike since protein used cell entry. right DOI see way full long term trials completed. 

Why? ""long term trials"" inconsequential. make decisions based emotions public opinion.

They make according science; states attempts casting doubt vaccine bullshit. Crawl back rock. idea new type coffee shop!

Photographic genius. recent CDC study Kentucky suggests better protected unvaccinated. study hundreds Kentucky residents previous infections June 2021 found unvaccinated 2.34 times odds reinfection compared fully vaccinated. findings suggest among people COVID-19 previously, getting fully vaccinated provides additional protection reinfection.

From article question, wanted add! Used brain, understood title still think bad title unvaccinated default state. Pre-covid exist. live covid. Taking additional precautions (e.g. vaccination) lowers risk.
You’re increased risk catching transmitting virus getting vaccinated, baseline. getting vaccinated decreasing risk transmitting covid developing symptoms related infection virus.
Additionally, getting vaccinated make risk infection equivalent pre-covid (which 0), still finite, less risk vaccinated. believe CDC estimated 120 million people USA caught Covid May (before current Delta spike). would think approaching 150 million point. r/angryupvote I’m vaccinated. think insurance companies need (instead also). either may unvaccinated pay much higher premiums, say reimburse 50% unvaccinated.

Everyone seems mindset even tiniest risk kind anyone society remain locked down. example might vaccinated healthy stay home could person rare health condition preventing taking vaccine might indirectly long chain transmission gets virus. words I'm held hostage small minority people can't get vaccinated.

As society lived terrible viruses, polio, measles, mumps, etc. many decades never got 100% effective vaccine, went lives anyway. reach level comfort Covid things return normal. mean time post covid world kids always ones getting vaccinated adults almost never kept vaccines school.

Make pay consequences. Well start with, Biden president pass laws. Congress passes laws. president write ""executive orders"" generally affect federal things example required masks federal property. can't single handedly change laws state local businesses. Congress would that. imagine debates would entail.

Individual companies make decisions whether require vaccinations. hard FDA approval much easier approval. example CVS Goldman Sachs news recently (just two happened read, surely many others). really anything Biden except perhaps generally encouraging people get vaccinated. Welcome “free-market” healthcare kids! imagine must’ve factored decision demand Pineapple Ham! Nah, company already charges smokers obese.

I'm OK pay insurance people's bad health choices. Scientist created model simulate lifetime health costs three groups 1,000 people: ""healthy-living"" group (thin nonsmoking), obese people, smokers. model relied ""cost illness"" data disease prevalence Netherlands 2003.

The researchers found age 20 56, obese people racked expensive health costs. smokers obese people died sooner healthy group, cost less treat long run.

On average, healthy people lived 84 years. Smokers lived 77 years obese people lived 80 years. Smokers obese people tended heart disease healthy people.

Cancer incidence, except lung cancer, three groups. Obese people diabetes, healthy people strokes. Ultimately, thin healthy group cost most, $417,000, age 20 on.

The cost care obese people $371,000, smokers, $326,000.

The results counter common perception preventing obesity save health systems worldwide millions dollars.

Pfizer said couldn’t comment potential regulatory decisions. Moderna said Wednesday completed filing full approval vaccine, uses similar mRNA technology Pfizer-BioNTech shot. Full approval Moderna’s vaccine expected three months, person familiar matter said. Johnson &amp; Johnson said plans file approval later year.

Federal officials last week recommended adults received two-dose regimen mRNA vaccines Pfizer’s begin receiving booster shots September. Officials said time shots would administered eight months second dose people ages 18 older. Boosters administered 80,000 pharmacies vaccination sites operating across U.S.

The effort hinges FDA clearance additional shots, recommendation vaccine advisory committee outside experts Centers Disease Control Prevention. Health authorities already authorized booster shots people 12 years old whose immune systems compromised. People 65 older individuals chronic-care facilities expected get boosters first, along health workers anyone else vaccinated earliest, according federal health officials.


Some public-health experts said boosters aren’t necessary based data shows ongoing protection hospitalizations death initial round shots. Vin Gupta, health adviser Biden administration’s postelection transition team, said believes boosters reserved people compromised immune systems, older people people comorbidities diabetes. “I don’t think there’s compelling data boosters everyone eight months,” Dr. Gupta said.

Leana Wen, health policy professor George Washington University, said approving boosters starting six months previous dose makes sense based available data waning immunity. “That doesn’t mean every patient needs get booster six months,” said.

Studies indicate Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine still highly effective people six months second dose. Yet evidence efficacy might diminish longer periods shot isn’t effective contagious Delta variant, prompting research adding third dose.

Pfizer BioNTech said Wednesday third dose generated stronger immune system original Covid-19 strain compared original two-dose course.

The submission includes data late-stage trial 306 subjects 18 55 years received third dose 4.8 eight months completing two-dose course vaccination, Pfizer said. Neutralizing antibodies—which play key role immune system—were three times much measured one month third dose, compared one month second dose.


The administration third dose also appeared safe trial, companies said.

The companies didn’t say whether data included well booster shot worked contagious Delta variant. However, companies earlier month submitted regulators separate results small, early-stage study showing third dose vaccine generated higher levels neutralizing antibodies original virus Beta Delta variants standard two-dose regimen.

Other vaccine makers also studying whether booster doses could help maintain protection virus. Wednesday, Johnson &amp; Johnson said second dose vaccine found study generate strong immune response, justifying booster shot. also don’t terminate employee pay unemployment, ineligible resign own.

the answer probably no. Modern technology/international travel around 50 years (or 100'ish years generous include passenger liner travel).

Even lower positions requiring vaccinations. saw sign shake shack (a fast food burger place may know) Comrade abbot really showing deregulation state about. mean guess, assumes perfect health. anything happens all, screwed employer fire insurance period.

Crap United. Darn it. I'm *shocked!!!*

Narrator: shocked. model predicts course fall semester, 90% elementary school students get infected without masks, 50% get infected masks.

Masks panacea. best, reduce kid's chance catching covid near certainty coin flip. okay kid getting covid, send school. not, keep Smallpox Anthrax vaccines kill 1 million people get it. Flight Attendant, would take chances still get Smallpox Anthrax vaccines.

What worst thing Flight Attendants getting COVID shots mRNA vaccines killed anyone. evidence anyone reaction either mRNA vaccines level killed them. mRNA vaccines literally safest vaccines ever made.

Note: J&amp;J vaccine mRNA vaccine. First, mRNA vaccine technology still relatively new technology. Prior 2020, never produced fully approved vaccine generally considered unproven. Second, prior COVID, fastest vaccine reached approval ***5 years typically, vaccines take 10 years produce get approved.*** So, opinion, vaccine manufacturers FDA deserve lot credit getting vaccine out, tested, approved within 20 months pandemic started. Science really hard, got done quickly. Third, given mRNA technology unproven, I'm sure easy would manufacturers enroll kids trials - imagine trying convince parents volunteer kids unproven untested vaccine, one never done one timeframe production compacted (less one year development). parent would willing kid tested on, way, credit you, think many parents would sign it. easy get 30,000 40,000 kids enrolled. I'm pretty confident going fast can, profit motive/incentive so, top fact I'm sure many researchers/scientists FDA/vaccine manufacturers also kids remain unprotected long vaccine approved. Side note: Today's Vox ""Today Explained"" podcast episode vaccine booster shots really interesting information vaccine testing approval process:

[Vox Big. Dumb. Animals. Many states don’t even report weekends Whether actually ran red lights sped irrelevant. point stands “personal choice” bullshit argument comes public safety.  calculation take vaccines anywhere near 100% infection account?

I'll certainly avoiding Delta fly; number reasons including one. Yep, work state job make less salary would position private sector get benefits. However, say finding list things excluded really long, mammogram. agree. Salaries higher states vs Germany example similar jobs. making 100k saving average $10,000 - $12,000 taxes every year vs country like Germany. Health insurance high income high tax savings higher salary offset that. Starting business many states infinitely easier overseas. Health insurance max pocket ever really hit emergency that's rare. Making tax savings better financially. universities free plentiful easier get vs ""free"" universities say Germany. state tuition top tier public university averages $3,000 - $5,000 every quarter. astronomical. state's also financial aid programs cover almost everything including tuition housing. Movies play ""too poor university"" card factual. Financial aid remarkable state side higher learning.

The perception states people overseas accurate. party small government… Effectiveness symptomatic disease, hospitalization, death better. that's really care about. Infection mean lot. means infected. infected mean important things happen are: disease, hospitalization, death. Plus infection tests normally qPCR fine general testing case test infectious virus. like $100-150   Neither Boomers got sick.  “If everyone could wear face covering next six weeks could drive [coronavirus] ground,” Dr. Redfield said Monday..

Ahh, see got idea universal masking would cut spread.

In clip, Redfield also Redfield went say wearing mask powerful weapon virus followed hand washing, social distancing.

This early summer 2020, fine information out-of-date, social distancing - i.e. around people might infection - *by far* best way prevent COVID. possible isolate every single person world homes 6 weeks, pandemic would end, would spread.

Also hand-washing limited effectiveness stopping spread, according CDC, virus primarily transmitted contact surfaces.

Delta variant, even that's enough keep outbreak going.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Lmao sounds familiar, minus year. Ya labor shortage almost every sector right now.and 2011 arguably worst job market since great depression. massive lie pushed non-stop power, propagated establishment media, trumpeted masses.

All evidence points conclusion ""vaccines"" - vaccines - entirely ineffective reducing spread distinction vaccinated unvaccinated intents purposes meaningless. data ignored cases covered keep pushing hysteria narrative. told admin needed shut down. didn’t believe me. next week shut down. told colleagues we’d rest school year *at least.* laughed told dramatic we’d back two-three weeks. stayed remote rest year. told librarian school would remote entire next school year. laughed said no, we’d back fall, worst case scenario Thanksgiving break. remote full year. People need listen science teacher. thought already finished testing efficacy we're testing safety.  That’s lot times. know specific trials, however Canadian government investigated got kind data least high priced guesses recommending schedules distinctly different (longer) vendors. probably teaching kids anyway. sounds absolutely nuts. Yes, that's immune system works. body develops antibodies gradually die time, maintain capacity produce again. Well done go Littleton Columbine shooting yet go Texas COVID.

I’d imagine principals prefer hire teacher doesn’t care possibly passing deadly virus students, mention clearly lacks basic understanding science. half million getting vaccinated every day?

This simply true. stubborn arseholes, lot unmotivated people too. young particularly. People's risk calculus fluid, peers get vaccinated change mind. masks required public outdoor settings, including large outdoor events physical distancing possible

Did you?

""masks required public outdoor settings, **including** large outdoor events physical distancing possible""

When masks required? public outdoor settings. Low vaccination rates always leads mutations…that wasn’t really unexpected. didn’t expect 1/3rd country reject it. could've done shit *month* back 2019 people took seriously. July 29, total 358 children reportedly killed COVID-19 So, kids need shot? Yes. great health community health get it? Yes. EUA granted vaccine response hundreds thousands deaths. Almost 1000 kids died drowning 2017. think CDCs perspective, 'emergency' held higher standard.

The numbers actually worse supporting emergency use authorization that. Using [current CDC 474 children died Covid, 228 12-17 range already eligible vaccination 149 5 included round trials. leaves 97 kids 5-11 died. Since roughly 28 million kids age group, fatality rate far 0.33 per 100,000. said, kids definitely get vaccine eventually, somewhat hard justify emergency approval. either scenario difficult. 

In San Diego 73% vaccination rate 131x likely end hospital unvaccinated. 

So definitely choose prevention, somehow still end hospitalized doctor consider monoclonal antibodies. brassy goddamned road runner. cases Texas started slow down? missed Chai-lie (Chili) near Rochester. love Upstate, hillbillies sometimes.  sail port New Orleans. capacity isn’t big Canaveral terms many ships dock onetime. ""No field trips""

I see problem field trips long they're places mask vaccine mandates.

 ""I expect stops starts virtual learning""

Probably depends bad situation gets there.

We tools keep Delta bay. long schools use them, kids go fine. laid supplies toward end February 2020. beginning March wore mask Joann get fabric make masks register, cashier looked like crazy said hand sanitizer station. said ""coronavirus L.A. now"" said ""Oh, I'm worried it.""

L.A. went lockdown 2 weeks later always wonder remembered crazy lady (me) happened. treatments make magnetic? /s office then? 2030.. Jfc.  Aw, shoot virus dead?  Titlegore sight, mind them. see first hand, real.  irecTo precise, shows relative chance developing symptoms versus control group, assuming similar amounts exposure. says nothing severe symptoms be, therefore dshow chance going hospital, though indirectly. also say anything asymptomatic cases definition efficacy.

Obviously, need know lot efficacy versus asymptomatic cases really central covid propagates also big impact long term impairment.

Unless went multiple, believe referring Tim Dillon Show. He’s guest second half podcast, like dry/dark humor I’d recommend checking whole thing!

It weeks ago, one pod week find easily YouTube page it. would rather people shitty immunity getting infected get people vaccinated?

I'd rather whatever gets us immunity overall get mess. end goal vaccines, immunity. Vaccines best way get natural infection turns better think, I'll take it.

Also need stop thinking anti-vaxxers take things pursue damn truth. crazy looking back started now. rotation cardiology clinic. finished talk diabetes treatments early instructor started talking virus china may/may come lab keeping close eye probably gonna come kill us. student take super seriously instructor bit high-strung, say least.

Fast forward two months I'm talking different instructor definitely stop rotations pandemic we're healthcare workers, course we'd work it. days later got notice we'd online out.

And look us now. We've gone hoarding toilet paper shoveling hydroxychloroquine injecting bleach dosing livestock dewormer getting vaccinated. ride. recall correctly, lot hospitals designate ICU beds COVID-19, mean ICU beds taken up.

But still, means vaccinated not, COVID-19 need ICU bed may screwed. Throw pack smokes everyone get vaccinated. thought mentioned passing people sidewalks count this. Really going large crowds like concerts. People mostly pretending someone else turn drop hat. NH live free die state. reject premise masks, testing. Let’s let everyone school get infected die. many deaths... MANDATE it! know google? watch news?   It’s risk/benefit calculation make. risk young children really small, know doesn’t always make anxiety better it’s kid. balance loss socialization early education may affect years come too. know that’s easy decision. Arkansas (6th lowest vaccination rate US) seeing surge hospitalizations. Thanks confirming vaccination, indefinite masking, keeps people hospital.  worried early too. actually reached clarification she’s post infectious known Covid infection. sons positive likely also post infectious.  think confused

Covid zero vaccine roll progressed always policy decided national cabinet

Different states different numbers cases

We well NSW dropped ball  Lie   idno man... cow-de-warming medication evidently pretty powerful.  Cant get covid poop lungs first. where's Delta vaccine?  Even still immunity previous infection already known fade fast. teach 7th 8th grade. students year easily full grade level, two, behind reading levels. aren’t, ones would readers either way - also, socialization off. struggle make friends one another face-to-face, lately catch kids texting one another sitting side-by-side, instead talking. It’s really disconcerting. could control first started, noooooooooooooo Let's litter cemeteries dead kids first, safe.... Well part today. Finally got first vaccination shot. got downvoted explaining still unvaccinated people need incentives easier access information. shows plenty people reached vaccines government trying EVERYTHING actually want stop pandemic That's thing though, actually predict (within reason) type vaccine resistant strains might pop up. seen either a) likely occur randomly b) retain high-level infectiousness. crazy recombinant scenarios could result something unpredictable, current assumption beta variant remain one dangerous vaccinated people. Even then, delta outcompetes vaccines effective enough.  know county record initial shots it’s tempting get $100 booster once. bachelor's degree. summer classes counselor said talked department moved stuff around need take classes summer. even watch virtual celebrity commencement speeches first award. honored. Thank you. made smile:). seem lacking data breakthrough, really understand CDC made collecting priority. data have, better understanding have.

5% seems high me, considering vaccinated make &lt;40% population Alabama. Alabama lowest vaccination rate US, highest infection rate right now. even portion unvaccinated scumbags actually got vaccine, many deaths among vaccinated could avoided. addition, Alabama mask mandate anyone. Vaccinated people immune deficiencies risk factors stand chance, regardless do. super sad. There's catch, though: billions people worldwide still can't get vaccine (because US rich countries producing enough? tried produce more? understand either). mutations happen spread everywhere. We're getting past long time afaict.  Yeah. wish would stop. I'm 100% favor vaccines masks since beginning pandemic... unlike Fauci. Deloitted see this! really. leading indicators good. obvious initial outbreak moved really quickly evidence spreading uncontrollably now. Two new Hospitalizations. cases. also try coup September 7th. Think want. pretty sure never jail. Ramen end everything want get people vaccinated not? Read “just world” bias grow liberal-progressive left-leaning, sure  teacher wrong.

Even cloth masks 80% effective.

NIOSH certified N95s average 99% filtration efficiency (Minimum filtration 95%). 


This Covid wards still open (they obviously use goggles gowns protection+).  actually go Ohio State pretty much everyone know, including ""bro"" types, vaccinated.  Mandates important thing come FDA approval. It’s gonna annoying people can’t go eat, go concert even work certain companies due mandates. Get vaccinated protect neighbor. last year proven anything, guy idea going on. understand people still listen all. irony slate left-leaning news source, right. 


He moved goalposts masking 2020.  
He also moved goalposts considered herd immunity based solely thought population would tolerate. Fauci, douche  statement god damn stupid bewildering see. apocryphal letter Skeeter Paul. 1 Skeeter 21: 11-12

""And God appeared Skeeter told him, ""The wise man wears mask, fool doeth wear one"". 

Skeeter took mean need wear mask. Wish could mandate get   quite possible parts country get past others won't. might result bizarre fencing pressure, something like antivax restriction zones. Unthinkable idea maybe, last years chock full unthinkable things actually happened. places 96% vaccinated still getting outbreaks? Oh miss read original comment, sorry. pandemic never ends… certainly expect that, least friend group. again, started warning people December 2019 stepped warnings January 2020. People didn’t listen, kept trying finally people listened mid March 2020. 

In case happen want prediction, Spring 2022 wildly optimistic Fauci stop peddling hopium. People act though every non-related person infected times maybe, someday, relax. meantime, hopefully CDC gets good messaging place, inconsistency ambiguity related masks public spaces killing people. It’s like none people charge country’s pandemic response ever interacted regular people. Maybe really lizard people…  getting past this. 

And due this, important people get vaccinated get vaccinated best technology since every man/woman themselves.

In theory mediocre vaccines would fine everyone got them. sadly that's case.   Yea February 2020 didn’t need wear masks “just yet” okay buddy  Uhhh... anybody going tell him? know, Orange Plague plans hold fundraising rallies across nation? let people die, mostly republicans, win-win? Thank do. Every kids experience. ^^ Childhoods lost. kids recovered socially academically yet.  Obesity factor, yes. one cannot fixed couple weeks like vaccination status be. 

Fact is, obese people taking beds UNVACCINATED! either way yalls “fat people die first” would likely still hold true anyway.

Why hospitals really “prepared people’s selfishness”. prepare that? kind waste would lead people just, y'know, selfish? don’t actually want lose money. think available Canada. get unlucky get infected anyway, may still recommended you. seems work really well speeding recovery reducing hospitalization.   Where?


You're telling Australia zero covid.

The whole world process getting zero covid. quite opposite, either or. 

Presumably vaccine, still get covid likely antibody levels high enough fend coronavirus. 

The monoclonal antibodies currently emergency use authorization, long doctor feels comfortable treating covid positive still take even vaccine. 

Monoclonal antibodies like another layer Swiss cheese behind vaccinations prevent death. actually happen, big businesses going mandate shots school districts need mandate students get COVID vaccine especially elementary aged children FDA clears 11 get them. like compulsory vaccines, get shot like COVID attending public school you. That's going overcome like public safety mandates like seatbelts, drinking driving laws, smoking indoors, vaccinations schools. make mandatory. rose dead suppose  actually got second dose today. People change  bad part: another fear mongering title article.

The good part: day passing scientists saying vaccine resistant virus unlikely.  Remember individual said, ""[return expected late 2021? So, post-9/11 restrictions end?

That's many us believe masks distancing forever likely scenario. Dude would rather covid work outside bar Florida. humid hot hell going put non smoking, healthy non drinkers front care line. obese smokers put back care line. treat drug addicts people dumb stunts hurt themselves. See goes build ramp put ass local school superintendent promised Newsom recalled, would remove mask mandates school. kids lovers literally line, can’t wait vote [better choice Covid there? cases brought back zero

Melbourne also brought back zero process  Well that's good know terms antibodies still present since March. got March April. So, I’m unfamiliar qualifies monoclonal antibodies. 

Since said it’s “either scenario”, mean high risk breakthrough cases (like cancer patients, etc) can’t receive monoclonal antibodies? got new data breakout Ptown that’s science works changes that’s lot things theories add new data prove theory. mean believe gravity it’s real it’s still called theory. obvious, they're staying, also vaccinate know number higher usually expected herd immunity? Let's hope nobody brilliant idea 69 people indoor engagement party........

#stillpissedoff Passing virus thru unvaccinated fully vaccinated people poses problem tho it...mutating virus stronger forms belive? scientists believe SARS-COV-2 continues mutate eventually lose ability infect people

Yes, would like much. got look like think anything wrong. bother saying shit like that's never going happen?

This tells there's end might well live life. mean get second doze soon release? 1 2 months?  God find job. chance particular region give 2-hour time slot 60 Minutes? NZ simply ordered vaccines later willing pay get earlier.  idea nobley waited fictional vaccine line impressive political falsehood.  Yes, NZ longer supply constrained vaccinating good rate. 6 months behind be. I've read _everyone_ world wore masks practiced social distancing, infections would simply grind halt. Covid would gone six eight weeks.


But nooooOOOOooooo, unhinged ""muh body muh rights"" refuse wear masks continue drag down. Meanwhile J&amp;J's CEO looking forward retirement AZ's CEO want get vaccine chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said ""goal initially really come help"". added: ""That it. **And one option us come help, deliver vaccine, go back core business**."""" odd take. everything right quarantine failure let community. 

They far managed stamp outbreak. able well. Dude, thank you!!! Got sick earlier year get blood tested time. tired. PCR tests came back negative, reason believe accurate due time place took them.

I'm sorry loss, guy married family. 

Do people take side? Don’t freak yet, aren’t NZ. 

Today good day many reasons:

* 1.6% population vaccinated yesterday.
* track immunise 10% population week.
* carpet bomb testing
* numbers climbing growing exponentially.
* health org. estimating case peak happen later week.
* high compliance locking down, testing, staying still. 
* able use wastewater testing track movement virus communities, country negative, unknown spots. 

The motto NZ beginning “go hard, go early.” 18 months done exactly that. *is* part plan set out. 

A week latest outbreak, laid need order open world again. also prepped us hard lockdown event Delta got containment. 

So, 62 cases today sucks, 48-72 hours peak right moves contain it.

Don’t lose hope, haven’t :-)  know hand roughly much R rate reduced by? would really like know single Pfizer shot hospitalization vs fully unvaccinated. Unironically, pm address I'll buy hazmat suit you. I'll pay shipping well. 100% serious really surprised that. Took covid test make sure infected again. Came back negative. symptoms either. Apparently problem Washington State. They're giving teachers school employees religious exemption getting vaccinated districts. 

:/ Awesome response! somone really wants die hill...You high likelihood happening! comfortable death either.These first people show ED (Emergency Department) begging oxygen. bad decisions start impact health others also every right put back line, refuse admittance onto planes venues.I think vaccine mandatory, unless legitimate documented medical excuse that's verified another medical practitioner.Many healthcare workers getting really tired Covid exposed daily.Many infected even full PPE on.I know controversial stance necessary IMO. Thanks. I'm gonna schedule antibody test. mRNA new tech, invested in. Even Canada, far larger country, produce own.

In Aus, able produce AZ - negative press South Africa, Europe, local severely hampered rollout due TTS. much year, predelta, hospitalised due vaccine virus - wonders enthusiasm. noted there's zero deaths due virus state year, Australia highly unusual here.

And pre-delta, thought could limit spread recommended younger people arrived (AZ lower risk older are).

Sometime back early year changed courses emphasising Pfizer majority, supply could attained en masse October.

Yes, naive. much kids 12 israel. People aged 60+ 92% vaccinated. 82% vaccinated adults. really weird look overall population much (in percentage) kids Israel western countries. all. Vaccine development quite quick process. go rigorous testing, sped still thorough.  I'm convinced. way endemic R hover around 1. Sure, R hovered around 1 past year idiot civilians, idiot governments, careful civilians, smart governments, vaccines, travel limitations, whole shebang. currently remain situation pre-pandemic lifestyle causes R shoot 1. leaves several possible future endgames:

* Endemic - keep dancing around lifestyle restrictions indefinitely keep R around 1 (possible think unlikely last many years)
* Endemic - medical factors happen balance immunity spread (also possible think unlikely last many years)
* Ramp-up - R stays 1 long enough almost everyone gets covid (possible actually endgame. add-on could happen one endgames)
* Drop-off - Herd immunity (either vaccines prior infection) becomes strong enough force R 1, infection rates gradually fall 0 (this generally requires remaining susceptible fraction population less 1/r0 r0 spread rate without immunity. happened already many places, ramp new mutations, unclear many mutation cycles keep happening.)
* Elimination - New Zealand's elimination strategy experiment successful, may copied. may require long-term travel limits lifestyle restrictions. R remains 1, cases 0 virus remains eliminated.     Sorry, exponential, dictionary link contradict that. kind progression mathematically expressed using exponent. even estimate exponent you, approximately 1.7 compounded daily, assuming 40 cases three days ago 210 today.  could try using Oxford's risk calculator get general idea: I've gotten infected covid back April 2020. Took antibody test 2 weeks ago showed 846 spike protein antibodies. That's 16 months since last symptomatic infection. thought comparative lit WTF didnt get shit many vaccinated individuals myself, already past this. I'm living life like normal again.

I went expecting evade covid forever. expect get one day believe zero-covid approach.

Once vaccines least emergency approval children, mask mandates need dropped. Yeah, live here, that’s wildly overstated. It’s pretty red, political neck-wise. never truly mandatory everyone. Even current ""mandatory vaccines"" apply everyone, applied sector-basis.

For example, even covid, military personnel tons ""mandatory vaccines"" want deployed, healthcare workers, schools states.

I get covid vaccine getting politicized going years.

They're going drag people street vaccinate them, currently vaccines. Generation C See, add onto that, think it’s kind odd perspective. I’d interested know teaching. Especially based “they’ll stop talking pay attention you’re authority” comment, patently untrue. r/teachers sub full teachers begging help they’re getting steamrolled classes. books books handling issue. 

The “group” thing really helps direct instruction (standing front room talking) tiny part teaching. DO, better. bigger classes never better that. “group” mentality would 10 kids. Upping 30-35 added benefit. 

Saying “sit nice listen” usually works well you’re teaching something WANT learn, like art science experiment. It’s easy it’s something they’re part daily routine. 

The real issue large class sizes isn’t getting pay attention I’m “lecturing.” It’s enough time individualize instruction give deeper assessments. Goal setting. Interventions (this HUGE). Things like that. say person lives city sometimes looking rural life hoping good mix intelligent people....these county county maps seem like good way find diamond rough.

Right it’s level 2, mask mandates still things opened social distancing measures place; indoor dining also allowed reduced capacity. Crowd limits increased too, people still wary.

1 breakthrough death

492 unvaccinated 

The numbers 60 speak themselves.

One biggest differences note 1. Canada much better vaccinated US 2. continue comprehensive lockdown mask policy helped keep numbers 3. access vaccines beginning compared US forced long delays shots (up 3 months). latter means (possibly) greater number partial think money directly, kind power opens alot possibilities would think I'd say that's false equivalence. action illegal everywhere.  also infrastructure give 4+ million people two doses speed larger populous countries can.

I mean it’s good putting mask mandates soon last time slow react heavy restrictions four months shipping icu patients province daily. can’t win. matter does, idiots crucify him. Fuck people. Prioritize vaccinated patients. voluntary unvaccinated themselves. shit giving unvaxxed equal treatment ""moral high ground"" whatever. deserve whatever happens them. owe anything.  Made America look like assholes again, again, again.  Everyone clever pointing previous predictions failed need remember predictions taken account:

* New variants infectious

* Outsized vaccine refusal

* Governments following medical advice e.g. relates masking

You also need remember disease exist two years ago, intellectually dishonest complain failed forecasts e.g. spring 2020. feel way. Numbers higher last year fully virtual NJ even allow remote option state online charter school like states does. 

Due concern daughter husband immunocompromised withdraw public school sign Pearson private academy fully virtual. really means 2024 doesn’t think handle it.  Yep, it’s difficult. remember adults vaccine tested efficacy symptomatic disease—I assume endpoint trial children. easier prove. Yes have, good them, that’s decent development.

And that’s great point bring up- reasons behind *why* people don’t get vaccinated. circles around original point. Man haven’t realized much loved hearing/seeing/having intrusive thoughts Cheetolini every single day. It’s refreshing boring President again. I'm sure laws already drafted. That’s BIG if! think 90% pretty far fetched, however good news everyday numbers climb. slowly increase. bad(ish) news also creep closer closer 90% unvaccinated people pass away. 

I think next 6 months see people learn (maybe hard way) vaccines much safer alternative, continue see steady climb. Hopefully US get approved kids 12 soon. big. You’re gonna wear mask rest life? guy. Oh? bout “Pomm-Pee-eye” Michigan opposed Pompeii? Located county “Grash-it” (Gratiot) BTW. *[cries Upstate NY Winter lasts 6 months anyway]* feel really sorry antivaxxers. dig ditch. Nothing wrong old govy shots. We've taking year everyone great, looks like. I'm sure gonna make without intervention. Fire dem gas chambers. LOL. viral load vaccinated human growth hormones leading us positive direction! MREs Civil Defense water drums

I'd fine handing lot Moving golf posts again! see you..in I.C.U thought going disappear! Wtf!   Free honeybuns they’ll refer friend! Remember Trump said summer heat would kill Rona? we’ll see end Easter? parent want wait, stands now, available babies. sticking annual flu shot year, something people get. Yet, people across ages die flu every year. everyone got annual flu shot, we'd see less deaths. we're going complain unvaccinated, get flu shot also relevant conversation.   Lol remember 2020 told us 2 weeks lockdowns slow curve? 2022 ""good control""? Keep sheeping guys. sure, POS this. least vaccinated POS. What’s option virus keeps evolving will?  1-1/6 = 83.3%, I'm assuming R0=6 (it might little higher). efficacy less 1-1/R0, Rt 1 without measures (ignoring natural immunity adding vaccination immunity) assuming 100% vaccination. CEO Banner Health made $26 million last year. think MIGHT hire doctors nurses? No. Please get vaccinated, listen CEOs.  Good control ass lol stop calling breakthrough infections? Like, they’re common enough point state already know you’re vaccinated still get COVID.

It’s mostly semantics know point I’m done pretending it’s rare. It’s common sure vaccination way go don’t need million fucking articles Melissa Joan hart getting breakthrough COVID someone else. Southern Illinois too. nearby similar here. many oblivious many getting infected beyond me. didn’t plan beds pandemic thinking deeply logically. issue mistaken data point would used calculation weight averages. think turning point. us supported masks distancing everything 18 months say enough.  Hilarious knows that. Sure. Appeals happen. Jab em all. county 30%. holdouts likely need forced mandates.  Eh, think state many redeeming qualities. understand take. problem anyone isnt grateful vaccine expects money POS. kind monster would think promoting masks would discourage people getting vaccinated? Oh also said people vaccinated experience current wave new COVID-19 cases state, saying gets ""little bit frustrated"" jurisdictions state still enforcing mask mandates, arguing jurisdictions implying vaccines work.  telling vaccines work. think that's worst message send people time think data really, really good terms preserving people .... saving people's lives ... reducing mortality dramatically,"" DeSantis said  Similarly- Salinas, KS, pronounced sah-lie-nass. millions hospitalizations, even 4% huge number people accurate say ""If vaccine, won’t need monoclonal antibodies"". 

It reserved people need though.  specific treatment people early stages COVID-19 mild-to-moderate symptoms. criteria treatment according people age 65 older

Those “medical-related technological dependence” tracheostomy gastrostomy. 
It cannot used patients already hospitalized COVID-19 oxygen positive test COVID-19 required, must reviewed physician health professional. decide whether recommend antibody treatment patient, usually means scheduling appointment local administration site. 
The treatments free.  Simple fact matter coronavirus going away. It’s never going away. We’re going need figure live it. Every person (barring medically unable) aged 12+ US ability get vaccine, incredibly effective preventing serious illness and/or death. Delta variant super, super transmissible. Get vaccine get Covid (or sometimes - vaccinated, incredibly rare get seriously ill though). choice. Let’s go business accordingly.

Also, since onset pandemic, less 400 children (anyone age 18) died Covid US, less half number died pneumonia. 70 million children US. chance Covid killing child exceedingly rare. Let’s put big boy, big girl, big whatever gender identify as, pants, calculate risk, make life. cannot continue live afraid. cannot continue stay home shelter place. cannot continue hold kids home school indefinitely. Let’s use individual liberties freedom best families. longer public health crisis - ERs filling easily remedied vaccines people’s arms. It’s time unite, time respect decisions others consequences decisions, time live life. well anecdotally went drugstore chain Monday get flu shot dozen people line pfizer shot. prior Monday, I've there, they'res nobody line anything. know coincidence, I'm hoping :) fucking bonkers Black people used medical experiments centuries they’re untrusting doctors. However, blacks getting vaccinated big numbers recently surpassed white people vaccinations. Orange guy’s supporters far least vaccinated group. Yep. didn’t get anything got shots. mean unless count protection hospitalized maybe dying. think still petty good new all. may need often. Anti-vaxxers please boycott Disney.    pandemic likely stretch least 2023 unfortunately. long world vaccinated, we'll keep getting variants. Nice! That's got getting vaccine. Using force result enough remaining people actually getting vaccinated. It'll cause chaos. Another vaccine triage post, totally fair makes lot sense especially since vaccinated person less likely die. way hell corona desantis let voter base get relatively worse treatment. it’s old fuck, much news-maker even then, game changed significantly since then, post history indicates you’re borderline illiterate, that’s what. Try harder pick sub audience less critical eye.  Yeah, spoke nurse there. They've converted recovery room ICU overflow. I'm sure people play biggest plays stock market much productive money hoarders penchant thrill seeking, suppose cash infusions takes scale mass production companies go public. First off. Good losing weight.  let walk issue consider long known smoking causes lung diseases comorbidity worsens outcomes many diseases including Covid-19 .  We’ve known many decades long it’s crazy anyone even ever smokes.  Yet one 7 adults do.  don’t look ingredients science. don’t care cigarettes benzene . second hand smoke kills tens millions people year.  Even quitting folks remain increased risk. seem agree people deserve medical care (they - don’t seem concerned taking bed ‘virtuous’ person decent civilization beds sick people ).  consider long known obesity causes heart disease, diabetes, comorbity worsens outcomes diseases including Covid ,  Look science going back decades.  know processed foods cause weight gain sedentary lifestyles cause weight gain yet data falls deaf ears Americans sit couches indulging foods entertainment, binge watching tv, never taking walk exercise.  obese neighbors science need fail year year improve condition (this rhetoric ugly rhetoric) . seem agree folks deserve medical care. do. means taking bed virtuous person? society beds sick people.  unvaxxed.  Yes unvaccinated makes person vulnerable increases risks dying covid. data decades like obese folks smokers have.  Consider it’s Less year rollout vaccine, product got fda approval YESTERDAY . I’m amazed feel comfortable declaring consumers product considered human get medical care failed report within months eligibility deprived medical treatment left die?  . 80 percent planet vaccinated part lucky minority.  still catch spread covid, claim “done part” injection, think spread little less unvaxxed folks especially masking ...it mostly less likely hospital bed.  believe better person taken drug reduce COVID symptoms still spread covid. family fully vaxed Pfizer passed covid person person July. vax doesn’t make superior unvaxxed neighbors , fortunate. I’m going demand better leadership scapegoating public health policy. Vax substitute infrastructure. paid taxes need Get beds staffing need it, every sick person needs care We're geting past this, then. county stlaled barely 50% nobody else getting vaccine. county shop worse: 43% moving.

On bright side, got antibody test back today: zero antibodies actual virus, nice 696 spike proteins Moderna jabs. Feelin' good!   watched episode today. That’s flat wrong. Kinda? Taking shirt one first things get home they're annoying: much rather wear mask shirt (and felt way covid context balaclavas). think that's enough reason say they're feasible long term.  mean deaths scant non-lockdown states. Arkansas moved #17 per capita deaths #11 short amount time. Mississippi #3 gaining NY/NJ accumulated deaths first months pandemic. Lousiana right behind them. 

Just look total death graph NJ versus Arkansas medical conscience objection law doctors could use refuse treat unvaccinated. won’t. It’s oaths. Though we’re point they’re literally deny care patients due lack bed space/medical supplies/meds needed.  “Top 20 ways pandemic could get worse. Number 7 shock you!” intelligence community stunned Taliban’s sudden takeover Afghanistan left thousands Americans stranded there? one propped WMD story justify invasion Iraq? live here? true statements false. let kids play sports without masks parents crammed spectating area can’t socially distance must mask.

""Severe Covid rare people fully vaccinated. paper published last month, Centers Disease Control Prevention said received reports 10,262 breakthrough infections April 30. tiny fraction 101 million Americans vaccinated date, though agency noted likely represented “a substantial undercount” breakthrough infections.

Of breakthrough cases, 10 percent patients hospitalized 2 percent died — cases, patients hospitalized died something unrelated Covid-19. median age died always game. deal kinda bumping slight random. awash delta least states. one put full test max viral load impacting vaccine quite time. mask vax let blow happen without mandates. what's plan happen? What's game plan/end point enact vaccine mandates? 

This serious question trying answer. Vaccinated people continue punished people get vaccinated Hillsborough county schools 50k students, doubled amount schools recording cases. Site changed title. CNBC originally “Delta” instead “Delta Air Lines” despite fact biggest campaign contributor confirmed investments Regeneron,… isn’t money?

It noted Ken Griffin also invested Pfizer Moderna. Moderna's stock particular exploded Regeneron. Whether Desantis promotes vaccines antibody therapies both, Ken still getting richer. There's lot people believe fate something similar. say things like ""when time, time"" act like they're powerless anything. maddening helpless are.  stack Governor's front yard. way Arlington Cemetery started. huge problem whole pandemic - letting perfect enemy good. “Wearing masks doesn’t guarantee won’t get covid bother?” “social distancing doesn’t guarantee won’t covid bother?” course “vaccines don’t guarantee won’t get covid bother?” Like people think one mitigation measures isn’t 100% effective every single time it’s worth ever all. Although let’s real type people say shit like wouldn’t interested partaking mitigation measures anyway regardless effectiveness. No. First shot wrote, kids haven’t time get second course opened weeks ago.

We don’t big gap AFAIK, people seem get second shot. We’re still bound deliveries city age groups 85-97.9% first shot bit less second. Lower age groups (&lt;40) still getting second one take maybe two months get fully vaccinated. Exactly. mess Disney they're allowed require vaccinations ships completely gut argument cruise lines can't same. they're afraid hypocrisy FL. Spreading anti-vaccine information harmful others. care, children fat otherwise risk, want know much lower risk hospitalization overall rate could skewed kids pre-existing health issues. No, makes sense. case, weighing risk may worth perceived risk point case. 

I think trying get original comment belief “just get vaccinated” everything would alright. Clearly C*vid n*t going away anytime soon. Unfortunately, live fact choices day day carry increased possibility affecting someone. think mitigate possible risk factors loved ones life completely rational. Sorry came wrong way. don’t want people labeling others “Grandma k*llers” visiting elderly taking believe good mitigation practices. V*ccination visiting someone mitigation tactic, masking. guess p*rsonal ch*ice based information you’ve taken in. 

I appreciate civil, way. dont see ""Tex"" named world. heard? anti-vaxxers healthy never need use health insurance never get sick never pre-existing conditions. /s  Cominaty fully approved Aug 23 available yet. others still emergency use only. vaccinate kids risk?

If prevent spread told vaccines prevent spread vaccinated people still need mask? 


I'm board vaccines, I'm struggling figure problem vaccinating kids addresses. Sounds like someone butthurt shame.  There's lot people bother getting give shit unless someone love dies it, even then.. may get it. headline read 2 ways: Delta COVID strain also raised everyone’s insurance premium… [WHO Status Covid [PDF warning]

Looks like Sinopharm BIBP approved 07 May 2021 NMPA (which think Chinese National Medical Products Administration), Covishield approved 15 Feb 2021 DCGI (which think Drugs Controller General India), Sputnik approval hold rolling submission Russian approval agency incomplete. [Like Florida passed law penalize tech firms de-platform last minute, add exemption ""company owns operates theme park entertainment complex"" Yep, sure. think morally sound response feel cases painful tragedies, examples far short potential humanity currently is.

At time, personally felt gaslit people. year half we've heard *incredibly* stupid shit, like ""Well covid bad, know anyone who's sick it?"" anyone grew stubborn, insecure, fragile parents infuriating hear. shoots emotional flashback makes feel helpless, like sense reality matter, like truth power I'm whim someone else's headcanon. one people winds hospital gasping breath final moments, feel pain pointlessly losing another human, also feel like world makes sense again. feel grounded, sane, vindicated. yeah, comes furious, triumphant *I told so.*

I feel particularly proud that, really feel ashamed it, either. wish lived world could feel pain loss, are, one. people work jobs, chance win $10K (at considerably better odds lottery) nothing ignore. Tyson trying lure people safer lifestyle, instead mandating (and losing bunch employees).

The carrot may mightier stick.  hoping would something like this. leaders / staff large church family attended since child vaccinated. kinda hoping would host vaccine drive honor part memorial. unvaccinated square one.

I pal. gotta get Christ injection veins. workers comp insurance effects interesting employers mandate bad reactions paid for. want know, oldest daycare days week I'd rather send big risk healthy kids.

I think PC nature society contributing withholding information fear offense, much like responses here. prefer palatable term, call obesity. fat fat may even obesity triggerd higher risk. Maybe even overweight. Smart vague? convenient combination. Thanks taking time, yes read part study. know CDC still recording kind data? says ""weekly report"" top page can't find newer one district COVID “Dashboard” last year weekly statistics many students staff currently positive, presumed positive, quarantine stayed summer summer school. mysteriously disappeared month ago even though summer school still session; link still “the content looking cannot found.” Kinda made side eye little. 

I kindergartener they’re allowing one parent walk first week. mask mandate. class 20. first day child came mask mom told TA “He doesn’t mask need give one.” said would hadn’t time got settled said goodbye. TA mask nose whole time. 

They mask breaks too—eating/drinking (I mean, yeah), outside time distancing, PE either inside out. They’re supposed wear bus (we drop-off, bus afternoon), there’s distancing buses kids attending year aren’t A/B weeks. sit siblings kids good masks it’s unnerving. 

I live high positivity area low rates mask use. people know unvaxxed, people don’t wear masks out. know lot people health care pharma industry still don’t take seriously, even spouse. gaslight self sometimes constant barrage quackery I’m around. 

I hope family stay safe whole ordeal. think it’s gonna long school year unfortunately. fiancee taking classes Texas State San Marcos saying there's little mask wearing majority classes might help classroom they're sitting hours end kids move around lot school mingle random kids several minutes time hallways, line bathroom, car rider line, etc.

So might perfect even hour protection would help reduce cases. Nobody implying masks would bring cases 0. I'm glad cities trying something. need develop system defy tyranny anti-vaxxing. feel probably titled something like “for better worse” guess that’s click bait. last heard FDA requested additional enrollment trial bigger data set 1 month Delta exploded. Sorry don’t info fingertips. 

All reports showing response similar adults sometimes stronger. Always use duckduckgo subjects controversial. return results  There's shortage all. That's hospital administrators make hundreds thousands dollars telling media. Nurses scheduled like shit, paid like shit, treated like shit, literally spat screamed anti vaxxers covid positive. blame one bit walking. watch defiant fools die needlessly every day. imagine?

Meanwhile hospital administrators keep raking money, give nurses thank pizza (fuck administrators like this), make schedules worse raise pay. act surprised Pikachu face nurses start quitting droves.    Holy fuck 😂 takes 14 days effect kick in, based clinical data approval studies. second shot boosts effectiveness, modest one shot. best time get vaccinated 14 days ago, second best now. Good luck happy negative. Stupid-19 really epic. totally relate sibling part anti-mask trump train. 

""Penis looking fuckstick"" one write down. backdate deaths actual date death. creates impression low deaths, added like 100 various dates August, around August 12 so. think number probably close 200/day now. looks like PDF released findings.

Square one. Mutations inevitable. boosters inevit. sickness endemic forced take mildly effective cocktails. I'd feel betrayed well, pal. say hospitals admit unvaccinated person COVID-related symptoms, full stop. Ever brain fart mix former latter get irrationally upset someone suggests diabetics pay born way, immediately feeling dumb? Yeah neither. they're allowing crew spend $2,400 annually right danger every passenger? Fuck that, make get vaccinated get flight. cant life understand state mandated business install anti virus level filters HVAC (air conditioning) systems eliminate touchscreen checkout systems.

This would eliminate huge amounts airborne touch related transmissions. thought illegal ACA. different self-insured? accurate? It’s illegal companies discriminate cost health insurance benefits employees. vaccines think illegal. business cover every employee equally, cannot discriminate. understand feeling. However, point it’s - think hospital beds take resources suck others. People dying ICUs filled covidiots refused get vaccinated. Innocent people suffering choices anti vaxxers make. ever. Trust around especially people talking quitting jobs forced, gunning anyone comes door ask vaccine. real information yet, optimal booster timing. I'd personally wait information rushing dose #3, even though there's probably little harm, likely add dose #4 turns there's better timing/better mix/not mix. 200 bucks month shit ton. might quite mandate, far away either. Yeah, original strain R0 2-3 needed 50-67% immune. 

Delta R0 8-10 need 88-90% immune. 

Actually caveat actual immunity - since vaccines aren’t perfect need correct that, actually probably closer 95% said delta. 

Many vaccinated get exposed circulating strain increase immunity baseline, eventually we’ll get boosters. 

TLDR need vaccinate many people wear masks foreseeable future. Florida...always leading way!!! Yeah, either people get vaccinated, unvaccinated die denominator shrinks. Either way rate goes up. :P Bring on. think also need conversation country food lobbies keep much American food utter garbage filled sugar 20 different names. we're let's get Universal health Care going mental health care bet number people struggle obesity also struggling untreated treated mental health issues probably pretty high. say someone struggled weight times cannot always afford good mental health care. partly fault main stream media. lead ""just likely spread"" headlines opening paragraphs, buried ""less likely get infected"" toward end articles like minor detail. Vaccinate cows covid solved lmao. act like 1800s names diseases. :just kind crud"" want people die, getting burnt going 2 years. People stupid. let run course hope make out. family member 2 weeks ICU family still get vaccine. going course people change minds. Idiocracy proposed smart people busy children dumb people know stop children I'll allow it. Anti vax tax. know now, physicians specialty hospital always went needed ER, tucked away lot people seem know there. would first place I'd start needed one. Shouldn’t 85-90% must immunized either naturally via vaccine? Hey picture local paper. like quote appeared news channel’s Facebook page

WTF basically stands Florida point. We’re hot mess one interested cleaning up. Anyone know allergy meds suppress Covid19 symptoms? Specifically runny nose post nasal drip subsequent phlegmmy throat disappeared taking loratadine (the 24 hour OTC one big box stores).

I allergies normal also poster child mild case Covid Delta would probably look like: original Covid December 2020 mild symptoms; one shot Pfizer back May; extremely healthy.

My allergies daily. days mow lawn pretty much expect show up. Yesterday specifically, though, pushed longer run exhausted may stress triggered allergies. days like yesterday worried potential spread, though, want know take allergy pill symptoms go away clear necessarily?

I know testing one-off option but, coming end summer fall, allergies going twice weekly occurrence me. work fully staffed office building also want brush potential mild Covid I'm fine. ""at home test"" would put mind ease. I’m former tbh get patient confidentiality needs situation publicized. Americans exposed helping shut collective conscious.  We're not. literally zero restrictions nightclubs forced close 2 am, masks required either. Get past? Nah gonna normalize it. become like flu. Let’s move shall we? Bad reactions incredibly rare even nudge dial workers comp. pause lasted like 2 weeks. giving constantly since then. significant numbers still giving people. anyone else think really bad idea generally open stores like walgreens cvs testing obviously draw sick people mix healthy people?  We’ve maybe 4 months so, prioritised certain demographics first, like elderly. Fairly recently they’ve open general public. Yeah, vibe “we’re real safe, I’ll postpone getting till next holidays” we’re “okay we’re back lockdown, little do, let’s get vaxxed”

Plus lockdown postponed couple days vaxxes, least flat mate gonna first day lockdown said postponed week. Important note fully vaccinated non-Covid pneumonia somehow antivaxxers keep refusing get hospital issue scary. 

It's time triage care vaccinated folks first.  (Obviously apply anyone young vaccinated)

Also, there’s element opposite Trump cult wants think helped. Stupid dying somehow became political. extent yes. imagine goal hide government. think point took at-home tests convenience, result government know got covid. There's really way inform government getting covid, without taking test testing location, perhaps want expose anyone else covid find already know. cared wasn’t vaccine. think it’s terrible 600,000 Americans die. think it’s terrible know there’s essentially magical prevention device, nearly every death turned magical prevention device.

Well could get *worser* Incorrect. are, depending study look at, 3 5 times less likely infected **with Delta** vaccinated. exactly zero studies show conferred immunity vaccines. one, post it, I'll point misinterpreted it. Haha, found ICU nurse. 

That pretty intense flex, friend. one hospital ever called inotropic supports. I’m sure retired military medic could handle rate changes levo. won’t find many types around lol least still God given rights!
/s ancient Hebrews would quarantine leprous outside camp. knew social distancing. reason mask mandates germ theory disease yet. big problem hospital's mandate vaccines. caused large numbers medical staff quit cause low hospital bed availability.

Mandating vaccines among health workers counterproductive. ignorant people. immersed made choices lots experience going firm therefore likely quit. Florida going obtain herd immunity natural way seems. good. Zero covid difficult strategy original strain, nearly impossible now. declare war things either endlessly profit - like drug war, continue grift tax dollars - like dragging foreign occupation funneling tax money away probate government contractors. profit made COVID-unless someone like Ron DeSantis - who’s literally invested paid company pushing Regeneron. get birth works charge nicotine users, generaly unhealthy (according biometric results) premium, makes sense here. He’s also pushing quarter ton. He’s chart — comorbidities chart. 

Being antimask antivaxx got death wish case. won’t. It’s oaths.


Wrong. We've reached point triage/ration medical care. means prioritize vaccinated healthy people would likely recover medical intervention. Non-Vax sent home oxygen best.  Could anyone possibly copy text non-American trying convince pregnant best friend bigger risk get it? 😭 he's unvaccinated. he's obese. friend mine same. husband survived, hospital while. Super quiet vaccines. Fuck. grim. wish people would wake real danger virus take preventative measures. Anything possible. particularly likely, though, unless immunocompromised, case anyone's guess. $200/month pretty big incentive. $2400/year. pretty big penalty pay ignorant disease spreader. 90% vaxxed huh? Gentlemen, pleasure. Breeeeeaaaaasssssst miiiiilllllllk....you make daaaaaaaaaayyyyy Delta carrier Yes. Guess we're fortunate medical professional wear mask God given right infect others. ok oscar company that. September 1st, one allowed building without vaccinations. October 15, everyone must come office minimum 2 days per week. Yes, antibodies work. would also true natural infection. thought Darwinism dead.  It’s Arkansas several times last month. moderna tell us booster look like? Shame.

Anyway, we? Delta Airlines getting Corona Beer treatment variant wave. better hire Snoop Dogg help out.

""Foshizzle nizzle. want get high, fly Delta Airlines.""    Kinky new therapeutic option emerges. definitely going lead protesting obese people charged more, diabetics charged more, etc. make awful transition?
Or care previously? Sorry , capitalism doesn’t like idea. Gotta keep stock market up.  know days. daily case numbers falling next week I'll start worry. administering J&amp;J US again? unvaccinated want work $15/hour stock job

My understanding, someone works local Dollar Tree, paying $9.25/hour. Rural north Florida here. store manager quit months back, unable fill position. wonder why. reading scores 3 6 percentile points lower. median math achievement dropped 8-12 percentile points

So guess know bad is. Yeah really. Would hard mask distance couple months take vaccinate population? Millions people wearing mask every day year half! NZ needs couple months. 🤷‍♀️  could seen coming. maybe sign!

It's perfect ""be careful wish for"" moment. - undertakers loving Gov. DeSantis's business model industry # CoViD Exit Strategies Worst Case Perspective

Before vaccines, let 3 million US citizens die CoViD would reached steady state (where, first, we'd expect 76,000 CoViD deaths per year; number would drop time). 
 
At point, thanks vaccine, even vaccinate another US citizen, could get back ""normal"" letting ""only"" another 670,000 US citizens die CoViD. 
 
The slow burn population managed mitigation efforts would've taken little 5 years never gotten vaccines. 
 
Right now, 180+ million (at least partially) vaxxed US population, similar, slow burn would return us normal year. 
 
Vaccinating remaining population (at least, 12) could accomplished three months.  
 
If somehow manage take vaccine route, could maybe normal Thanksgiving year, could definitely normal Christmas. 
 
Either way, assuming insane new variants, we're year normal, and, people would right thing, could start fresh 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

(questions critiques welcomed) Triage needs revamped ground areas. I'm aware contagious, children ultra low-risk group Covid yet people continue advocate extreme measures protect them. seem rational me. couple days back mentioned probably already hundreds cases (cause math), paragraphs ready go ""proving"" wrong. 

I disagreeing, still disagree, idea hundreds unknown cases floating around community already. one giant super-spreader cluster, Samoan Church conference. That's different loads unknown cluster city know about. 

The church cluster much easier contact trace quarantine within close-knit community. Unfortunately low-income community large multi-generational families high rates obesity risk factors. expect lot cases spreads households. blow numbers, create much risk community already quarantined. 

From friend mine makes mathmatical models, expect 90 cases tomorrow. worry me, long cases epidemiologically linked lots new exposure sites lockdown. scary thing 90 even 100 cases day. many cases infectious community. number stays zero, virus hit wall soon R-rate vaccinated populations able control Delta outbreak starts, understand certainty. may matter much mass testing is, false negatives, mostly pre-/asymptomatic spread Delta.

China controlled Delta lockdowns population vaccinated far less effective vaccines (and thus need continue using harsh lockdowns). Queensland shut Indooroopily cluster Victoria seeing cases fall similar vaccination rates weaker lockdowns NZ. 

The false negative rate PCR tests very, low. anyone close contact 3 tests even negative must quarantine 14 days anyway. none flatmates family public negative day 5 test well. Plus lockdown already limits contact anyone could dramatically. 

I remain confident outbreak crushed. big question long take. I'm hopeful 4 weeks China, couple lockdown violations bad luck like August 2020 outbreak (an illegal church service created new cluster mid-lockdown extended restrictions several weeks), could see stretch couple months more. Gotcha yeah agree. 

This pandemic combined work culture social policies put lot people really shitty positions. Thats fair then. periods altered by: jet lag, changing diet exercise habits, exam time stress, taking birth control pills morning pill, getting flu, etc. None effect fertility. get long term immunity getting Covid twice anyways. Honestly it’s weird parents won’t let kids decide age like, 14. mom strongly encouraged get flu shot every year left certain point. Good. nice done unhealthy choices. think ""tired"" word would use. ""Exhausted"" appropriate I'm feeling, perhaps ""pissed off"". month almost normalcy long phase pandemic last? Private businesses free mandate vaccines state. kind complicated. Districts virtual school option, state 2 options. One full time, home school oriented go pace.

Apparently kid advanced basically virtual school they're regular school whatever they're advanced in. point sending kid school virtual school. health problems lead overweight, like disability limiting mobility limiting ability exercise. Plus, can't catch bad case obesity passing obese person grocery store. Unvaccinated people increase costs themselves, obese people increase personal healthcare costs.  drive-thru sites CVS site near little shed built outside store testing it. big signs front building warn COME INSIDE COVID TESTING.

Almost everyone going form immunity boosters kick provide even more.

Covid continue making people sick killing forseeable future, finally becoming deniers claimed - bad flu season. understand importance schools parents students receive proper education. 

However, mask mandates simply aren’t going work school environment. 

You can’t expect kids especially young ones social distance properly wear masks day. It’s reality. Add certain parents forcing politicized views pandemic kids it’s disaster. 

We’ve waited long schools, end year 2022 won’t end world keep kids safe least states likely require vaccine mandates students high vaccination rate. 

Otherwise going haunt parents effected children getting sick, long covid, worse: children parents potentially dying.

I could probably cause whole bunch water damage house brought inside turned on, would really say house flooding problem control!

The RSV thing kids unfortunate states lots unvaccinated people, definitely agree. would almost say kids need masks RSV since many kids underworked immune systems right now. Nah push forward. either get vaccine get immunity infection. Either way push forward. majority high vaccination rates Chicagoland, handful counties downstate decent/okay vaccination rates - notably Champagne (UIUC), Sangamon (Springfield), McLean (Bloomington/Normal), Monroe (Wealthy STL suburbs) counties. rest downstate real bad. really good friend mine talk vaccines already 2 Pfizer doses said scared vaccines giving form disease future children future could make likelier cancer something. antivax close all, fact whole family vaccinated, stuff can't possibly true right? mentioned read articles I'm pretty sure bullshit antivax articles. It'll look like first shot. I've already gotten third shot moderna (immunocompromised) Well example Covid may kill people even denying medical services.

Electing right Governor might save life. Soooo we’re going get past then? Holy shit I’m guessing Delta doesn’t run health insurance company. Good point; don’t know what’s worse.  honest, scares hell me. already problems area can't afford anymore. course people going say, can't afford covid either. However managed avoid coivd whole time. can't risk impact bodies cycles. None immunizations caused menstrual problems. pandemic over, parents going realize they'll need take larger role child's learning want maintain forward momentum. saving lives? good, take money. - cancelled wintering plans Florida 2nd season row happening. hit sorts solicitations RV parks past 4 months Florida Arizona, something never seen before. intentions going place COVID addressed seriously. alone Delta makes HSA contributions work towards weight loss healthy weight range, way yes. put premium BMI fair What's going Novavax? would think would working 24/7 try get emergency approval still nothing. Yes, aware delayed approval submission US yet again. applied approval India, Indonesia, Philippines think plan apply approval UK soon. took long? Unvaccinated people choked ERs across country, must costing fortune. Breakthroughs thing despite misconception, brutal. something fight disease critical ending all. believe it’s they’re raising premiums, rather taking away $200 worth employer provided incentives. 

I.e delta paying $250 towards employee premiums, awarding $50 unvaccinated. overall premium didn’t change, split pays did. whitehouse strangely enough.  Oh yeah, I’m Life insurance industry know well. Funny enough, covid questions (vax otherwise) still don’t show carriers exams Perhaps get 85-90% places, nationwide. JoCo, Jake. JoCo.

These days enrich cereals pastas also found various proteins veggies. told need actual venom counteract stuff inside vaccine, think they'd start Snake Bite challenge? Save ventilator someone else. cases increasing slightly England good amount Scotland.

The idea anyone pandemic it’s premature.

let schools full unvaccinated kids start one thing declaring victory. That's want know. problem people believing various deities religions. problem people cherry picking rules choose follow based situational needs wants. one ever said was. anything 100% effective every stage useless harmful now? full approval FDA convince him, nothing else will. Nothing do. remember article UK saying despite effective vaccines are, vulnerable still likely need hopsitalisation vaccination young person. build them, come.  someone shame oldest got vaccine ""now never children."" flash anger, said, ""But least she'll always phone signal."" can't reason people. already got stupid reply someone else assumed correctly would go road Chicago, Milwaukee, Madison, Twin Cities fine. surrounding areas significantly less fine. getting sick covid long nasty illness long term effects. People covid struggle breath die, it’s easy way go.

also much less likely get seriously ill vaccinated. plus high level vaccination protective everyone.   would assume process would make vaccine less effective buy I'm scientist say, maybe yes maybe (and extension KN95 KF94) masks EXTREMELY effective protecting protecting others. surgical mask tightly fitting cloth mask somewhat effective (nowhere near N95 though). Surgical masks cloth masks largely show. Ah see. something like art, agree group helps loosen feel less self conscious. Except poor kids get stuck one art prodigy every class haha. 

The hard part think everyone agrees small class sizes better. don’t want pay it.  mean ""getting past this"". occurrence variants? know vaccines stop variants right? delta spread much vaccinated unvaccinated virus loads shown. continue true since later variants evolve differently earlier variants.

So mean get past this? understand. Well, freedom ain't easy guess... living make believe world believe that. keep big load away me. It’s 20 years since 3000 Americans died 9/11 still memorials stories papers moments silence...etc. 600,000+ dead year people don’t seem give damn. nobody able declare war coronavirus.... preaching choir, fam.

The site, located Bloomington, Indiana, United States (US), operated Catalent. site perform finished product manufacturing.

In addition new manufacturing facility vaccine, CHMP also approved several alternative sites responsible batch control/testing packaging finished product manufactured Catalent.

On 30 July 2021, CHMP already approved scale-up active substance manufacturing process two sites US (Moderna TX, Inc., Norwood, Massachusetts Lonza Biologics, Inc., Portsmouth, New Hampshire).

&amp;#x200B;

news flash, bleach ain't injectable amount stupid I've read online, might want change 3025. March. threshold positivity 0.8, still trying figure constitutes actual protection, that's one goal study. Also, understand ""units"" arbitrary may translate across different testing programs. little Texas study, range 0-2500, ""above 2500"" possible result.  college. bet form application anything college get plenty troll applications hard separate real ones

It's already anecdotal case particular makes little sense take particularly seriously.

I'm concerned data breach anything say anything points vaccine bad, scientific not, get downvoted. safe space. There's way I'm going convince parents get booster shot. whole song dance first two. 🤦🏿‍♀️ Missouri... AG put lawsuit school mask mandates kidding. Stay home read family Bible. Well pfizer got full FDA approval like yesterday, so... mammoclonal antibody treatment getting downvoted. feel like clear lot people vaccine prevent covid. I'm correct, extremely successful preventing original strain last year, Delta strain. Wtf wrong people? like lives devoid meaning combat ""mask mandates"" wearing mask part identity. Never knew putting piece cloth face could controversial. honestly pathetic. There's real things fight for, right wear mask ain't it. also need stop using total vaccinated pop denominator. Break daily cases % vaccinated not. That's much clearer picture. Yes we’re concerned Hmm. Well people die even vaccine wouldve died without one even faster. people really dog shit immune. none. can't read article behind paywall. upon research seems talking number *Adults* received first dose vaccine 73.2% according CDC. 60.9% total population (including children) 1 dose 71.2% 12 older least 1 dose. Back original point talking *Fully* vaccinated. numbers drop 62.6% adults 60.4% people 12 older 51.6% population including children. opinion delta variant strongly affecting children 51.6% number need get 70% start reach heard immunity. I'm scientist cannot speak data means new variants started spread. Source - moms stay ICU 1.75ish million 5 weeks intubated entire time except 3 days. survive. thought dad going heart attack got bill. ask much still pay even insurance. want stress already was. Insurance judgment, cares correlation traits claims.

If top 10% claims coming people shared trait present bottom 90%, increase premiums people trait. care trait is, even directly care correlation trait health outcomes. want balance actuarial tables. comparisons silly. Bhutan got doses via donation. Finland part one world's largest economic political units. think lot people forget people lives school. It’s extra curricular activities also help spur rise. 100% masking schools distancing soon school kid gets sick it’s attributed school opposed gymnastics, dance, soccer, football ( outside school).
I also think school session forces people get tested would say school isn’t session.   J&amp;J much higher breakthrough rate either mRNA vaccine. vaccines (vectored inactivated) even worse.

You're probably right Pfizer lower dose. see us hiding vaccinated non-mask wearing people... think failed explain point. 
It really persecution elicit outcome. 
It persecution proactively get result want. 
We know shaming people doesn’t work (nor anyone). 
We know though ban people taking part society, measurable impact. 
We know change, finding new method mitigate negative impact society. There’s definitely something bizarre submitting detailed health specs insurance company, everyone line. don’t personally mind anyone knowing blood labs, get it’s concern. personally draw line sharing part genetic code 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yeah agree. Children company mandates fill gaps, maybe liberal cities put mandates well. saying vaccinated still spread disease. vaccinated protects vaccinated. Well maybe, breakthrough infections cause concern us. looking research standpoint good measure. want place last year struggling going overtime, caught unprepared malady people thought would Easter. 

We should’ve prepared better don’t want make mistake again. mean accidently leaked lab due poor safety big issue. Roger, Roger. Curious why? socialist/communist regimes handle dissenters. Promise utopia, deliver kind of, strip away utopias anyone central command deems ""other"".

Edit: forgot ending everyone starves another country save people. agree - insurance companies need pay care though. would real brave parents, first ones name child router's IP address.. Yes. That's good times. Sturgis 2020 took 3-4 weeks. expect same. typically included fetal tissue objection, way. people cite use fetal tissue production manufacturing rather initial testing, requires ongoing use fetal tissue. Dead people need houses :P Sure, point below, Delta move hub would plenty States bidding war offering tax incentives get come there.  Nothing different first dose. yeah, i'd assume so. unvaccinated made personal choice inoculated contagious/deadly virus still infect vaccinated people. whole point vaccination help protect others around helping add layer protection yourself. Tell overweight contagious since missed prior answer? Yeah Im fucking board people facing consequences hurt financially. Make pocketbook suffer. really wonder affects people waiting treatment. Like folks arent even covid I’ve reading that, short staffing issues, wait hours doctor even available. wouldn’t surprised tacks thousands dollars onto bill, hope doesn’t. Yessir. read guy get 3 rings shots like 3 4 months due relocation. take across world dont fuck around vaccines. It’s hovering around 240-260 last days. probably wellness plan rather straight BMI...or I'd hope least.   Google reporting number long time though…. even mean? Lots things ""could"" happen. data people original Covid getting re-infected Delta severe case vs original compared second infection asymptomatic milder?  novavax proved stop infection much higher rate could probably get approved basis Pfizer aims stop severe infection. Yea, misinformation huge hurdle get vaccinated. Especially given mRNA vaccines relatively novel technology (though vaccine studied ones we’ve date). folks set ways makes sad treatment politicized antagonized year ago research folks overdrive trying develop test make sure get mess. Say Joseph Stalin, zero COVID-19 deaths rule.

Article, however, [MK Chief Minister India's Tamil Nadu State. Thank you, lot's ignorant people spouting misinformation here. also can't done people individual plans ACA compliant well. ""We're Delta Airlines, life f***ing nightmare!""

Sidebar really like flying Delta bad rap. Yes, them. three big carriers got together blocked Google Pay attempt force us.

Then Apple mobile payments payment ""first"" years Google allowed compete.

-Still bitter Note krispy kreme customers - next time see hot doughnut light, go ask fresh doughnut *before* goes thru glaze. incredible. good luck. i’m feeling way. Jfc like we're already blade runner. people eat shit up?? able find quick search, I’m sure there’s others, believe NIH ongoing study well. report findings 84 women received SARS-CoV-2 vaccine pregnancy 116 women control group receive vaccine (Table ​(Table1).1). Women vaccination likely deliver vaginally. first inoculation 46±24 days delivery 75 patients known vaccination timing. Vaccinated women showed robust antibody responses, whereas women control group negative examination women vaccination showed increased incidence decidual arteriopathy, fetal vascular malperfusion, low-grade chronic villitis, chronic histiocytic intervillositis compared women control group (Table ​(Table1).1). Incidence high-grade chronic villitis higher control group vaccinated group.

As previous study, differences directly comparable, calculated proportions adverse pregnancy neonatal outcomes persons vaccinated Covid-19 completed pregnancy similar incidences reported studies involving pregnant women conducted Covid-19 pandemic. Thanks much explaining that. wondering could due restrictions ACA pre-existing conditions. makes sense. I'll definitely check Grand Rounds thing; thanks. 

If non-vaxxed re-infection turns twice deadly, would surely bump death estimates, extend time till normal (at least, fail vaccinate majority remain hesitant), likely even boost steady-state estimates. however believe would add much. 

Since reinfections still less likely initial infections, reinfections would way deadlier boost 670k deaths estimate 1 million. would push us closer two years till normal (given vaccinations).

In 2020, shutdowns, masks, restrictions made majority hospitals able keep (as stressful terrible was)... could've waaay worse. 3 million people could've died, yet ""only"" lost 300k first year.

Even potential far deadlier reinfection unvaxxed (at rate two half times higher vaxxed), we're still least 3 times better start 2020.

In 2021, we've thus far managed keep overall hospitalization rates par last year fewer restrictions mandates (thanks vaccines). 

If things really start getting control again, though folk less likely comply, restrictions mask mandates reimplemented. Either way, worst-case remaining deaths much smaller before.

&amp;#x200B;

Off watch Grand Round thing. Bats big deal. come crawling wood work soon shit talk downvote. don’t think it’s approval. It’s early trials determine difference efficacy. 

If numbers staggeringly different one way other, I’m going make choice get booster it. I’m going wait regulatory agencies ‘approve’ mixing matching. feel like sympathy cost wise patient pull though.

If do, happy pay full amount. not, maybe charge cost?

Truly sorry loss stress caused. Good. Awesome haha, love stories behind eveything. There's town long Island called Levittown one section streets named orphan girl Mr. Levitt told he'd give money every street named. Something like that. I'd love compile town lore book like that.
Always nerd things, new friend. I'd love Faraday room lol honestly need stop reporting ""since January"" data post studies months starting J. Yeah, think extending pre-existing conditions good idea. That's already done dystopian fuck. Vaccination separate issue. FDA approval vaccine mandates reach 90%. matter time. 70% figure referring adults received least one shot. think disingenuous say half country vaccinated reality ""unvaxxed"" population consists people waiting second shot children (who least risk covid). Thanks condolences. billing dept hospital told throw away bills, there's way anything cost. yes I'm US, desperately trying leave mainly shit like this. What's happening new strain causing vaccinated people able infected / spread slightly lesser degree, severely less issues body deal properly vaccines. young vaccinated matter. Us flying, vast majority vaccinated reporting infected waste time. used scare. understand FDA requesting info. thought time. 

We’re time. Delta saw that. 

The reason don’t see kids bad shape adults less bad habits (years smoking/obesity/high BP) even things rising among kids. 

What kids much much longer shelf life. 55yo sequelae going suffer lot less 15 yo damage. supposed take Freedom^tm counter COVID? oral injection? shove ass? Agreed. Research definitely shown true. biggest concern touting studies like worry may persuade pregnant women wait get vaccine pregnant false hope breastmilk provide protection baby. currently several Facebook groups pregnant women I’m 36 weeks pregnant, seen multiple women say going delay getting vaccine baby born. concerns given many reports I’m seeing pregnant women getting severe covid cases dying. That's good news.  actually live one vaccinated states, holding vocal minority (that can't avoid) probably messing perception. awhile since ive sunday school, isnt passage Leviticus diseased wearing masks seperateing group clean again?  do, choose exercise keep ~~bribes~~ campaign support coming really. person exercises like fiend eats right control weight diabetic insulin high legacy BMI bring keep certain percentage. That's still going healthy BMI range, treated like lazy, diabetic couch potato candy cake eaters, we're not. whole risk profile lower, even though BMI still high.

Secondarily, BMI created 1831 racist, sexist pig whose stats reflected concept right weight people age, average weight far lower average height much 4 6 inches shorter. really good system, create new one based current science. vaccinated unvaccinated shouldn’t scare you.  Yeah! Take anti vaxxers smokers, obese, alcoholics etc..?

Health care provided based ability pay. nature seriousness condition.

I think 🤔 Heck, daughters NICU stay millions 2 weeks! would hesitant use former Governor questionable morals judgment yard stick nearly question honesty. Even one shot covid flu vaccine (I think difficult imagine happen quickly), year covid shot fine absolutely necessary. 

They need work formulations vaccines though order lower side effects. got vaccines fun hoping figure stuff well. ideally like flu shot people side effects. 

Thank reasonable. many people not. nyt paywalls. fully vaccinated. that's probably accounting immunocompromised people missing third shot series partially vaccinated (it consider booster anymore: standard part initial shot series now), may actually 50%. 

That said, Delta 3 times contagious evades partial vaccination lot better WT Alpha. longer use partial vaccination significant controlling virus. new variant, need 85% immunity instead 60-70% immunity. 100% people fully vaccinated would still give 85% immunity alone (however people infected fully vaccinated could help get total immunity number) waning immunity Delta's limited escape. ACA mandates pay 50% employees healthcare costs even paying can't individually take away employee paid premium, across board. compare long COVID? sorts things prevented. easily vaccine.

And many employers discounted premiums losing weight. That’s new all. Delta CEO referred COVID-19 mutation originated India medical name, B.1.617.2, rather common term, delta variant.

Lol Something like already kind exists. Old flash animation “Ghetto Delta Airlines”. sure appropriate days. 

Definitely dunno dude, “Delta” kinda ruined Animal House now. Mental health definitely taken toll, well elective care treat possibly terminal maladies caught early. I’m saddened inundated hospitals south since it’s going result deaths vaccinated individuals needed said elective care (I.e. cancer, solid organ transplants)

Eh infections still value research purposes knowing variant. ask me, rate it’s matter folks going get infected. 

As long covid. honestly don’t know, we’re still trying find out.I saw recent article saying may found enzyme formerly sick patients may cause delayed recovery, we’ll see!! I’m excited see find help! correct, \*Fauci\* choose beagles. hate animal research myself, tried job required work mice quit. beagles docile entire animal research industry uses them, far uncommon. i’m sorry loss. assuming you’re US, system ffff’d im sorry aunt received bill. Concerning company’s press release made mention booster shots potential impact delta variant safety relatives vaccine available make risks COVID well within parameters used living normal life years. overweight contagious dangerous others around you? Snake juice, say? Narrator: no, won't. calculations trying minimize risk breakthroughs using whole vaccinated populations denominator including data Delta dominant strain virus. need areas reporting figures June/July Delta factor, grouping vaccinated people together they've exposed virus. gives better indication vaccine efficacy 6-8 months, especially older populations. created

Variants ""created."" called mutations.

And TIL: UK apparently ""3rd world country"" now.  think probabilistic terms, absolute terms. possible. likely. likely depends timing doses, immune system, viral load got exposed to, many exposures, strains, etc, etc. 

But unlikely events happen time dealing large numbers like, say, 8 billion people. get Covid 3 doses Pfizer? Yep. *somebody* get Covid 3 doses Pfizer? Almost absolutely. you? Probably not. Got em coworker tragically lost husband covid. difficult breathing night, went downstairs sit chair try sleep, woke dead. inability breathe caused heart attack. 

Other information, vaccinated (based political reasons), wife adamantly swears die covid doctors lied death certificate (because allegedly collect $1000 lie death certificates - though clear president Trump sending checks!). 

She however accept FEMA funeral payment people died covid. done that, still insists die covid. Someone know sudden acute medical emergency. May pull almost immediately required ventilator. covid related.

Took almost week find open icu bed somewhere state.

But everything totally fine Texas. recent poll could find indicated 49% parent plan vaccinate younger kids. Delta surge could push number higher knows point.

[The poll found 51% parents children ages 3-11 say unlikely vaccinated. Additionally, 40% parents children ages 12-18 – group currently eligible – say new strain comes Florida hope sue living shit state.  Canada never outdoor masks mandates far lower death rates west coast states them.

They security theater. They've got anecdotal data anyway, participants successful pregnancies.  And? imagine lawsuits. disproportionately impacts minorities, even though intention I’m vaccinated, don’t think forced upon anyone don’t feel anyone denied medical care either.  weird think anyone would think spewing forth spit around ""god-given right"" tiny droplet form. mean think much times relatively harmless inhale time. pandemic much bigger deal swapping bodily fluids people. weight loss candy!??? Big time oof. That's an... unfortunate... coincidence company. Sucks. leave tables streets permanently. SCV always manages suck ass section that? restrict them? data that? feel like would spawn daytime movie flustered relative committing murder pillow. I’m technically obese. I’m 5’6-5’7ish, female, 155 lbs. body fat percentage like 28% something last checked. wear size small size medium brands shirts. case anyone wondering, refusing get vaccine, without approved exemption, would likely considered [failure obey punishable Uniform Code Military Justice, based past precedent.

Punishments vary, [troops refused anthrax vaccine punishments included docked pay, loss rank, dishonorable discharge, brig time. mean time reach 85% matter much mutates?  completely ignoring fact 99% severe disease death unvaccinated.  Kids protection.  would rather live life fear getting shot someone proactively protects children community probably anything change mind. make sure ok looking mirror admitting that. Black market sperm. feel ya there. It’s complicated emotion-triggering subject. 🤔🤔🤔🤔

It’s encouraging mothers get boosters Flu TDAP pregnant start vaccinating quickly follow timeline Pfizer, early december NZ five billion unused funds unspent wage subsidies earlier costs lower expected economic recovery stronger (thanks covid zero). enough, debt:gdp ratio great, borrowing current low interest environment easy cheap. What’s backup plan? future CDC says “it turns vaccine isn’t safe kids, everybody including vaccinated adults going mask forever”. That's thinking can't find data supports one way another. vaccinated still spread virus saying can, doesn’t matter every adult vaxxed kids aren’t, still spread. ACA limits employee contributions 9.83% employees income employee coverage.

Parents clamoring, don’t blame them. agreed to/signed in-person school months ago, masks, social distancing reduced capacity effect cases - plus Delta. And, time, Pfizer projecting September availability vaccines. go class like month mask distancing get shot, sounds good right? 

Except now, places least, safety measures gone we’re hearing vague “mid-winter” predictions vaccine availability. remaining \~50% get shots.

Short blanket vaccine mandates imposed state/federal government population (which I’m favor of), I’m yet convinced individual employer mandates much. IDK, Delta FAR best policy responses COVID US airline. I'm difficulty putting hands it, remember last year looking pneumonia numbers told strange story.

The average US deaths pneumonia around 50k per year. first quarter 2020, already 50% number. pneumonia deaths, testing. first quarter testing increased able identify COVID cause death. 

Here's best info get, blue pneumonia death line, realize chart ends June last year. now, current US stats. 

66% least one dose 59.3% fully vaccinated. 

7-day average hospitalizations 88k compared 127k January peak. ICU 22k compared 28k January peak. 

7-day average new cases 151k compared 259k January peak. 7-day average deaths 1.1k compared 3.3k January peak.

It apparent despite decent rollout vaccine, new strain significantly dangerous. would completely screwed without great timing vaccine. quickly approaching high level damage proactive measure taken within next 15 days. surprising. 

Per CNN, US intelligence agencies obtained database virus genetics WVI kind analysis, seems nothing came effort. don’t think that’s shocking. school session I’d imagine people would get tested ( probably prove don’t it) positive. Fir people don’t believe civics issue can’t imagine getting tested unless absolutely to. Yeah, like, someone going blood pressure cholesterol levels, provided they're good, are. Congratulate me? isn’t true lmao Nice triple entendre got there. Even managed neatly stack third use without seeming forced. sorry hear that\^2 They’re Natural Health-style mouth breathers. Moderna yet officially approved FDA. submitted request today. pickle there. So...fuck everyone 12 eligible vaccination guess? nothing context conversation serves piss people off. thought made good point first section last sentence poisons message. 

I’m stranger that’s opinion. Type 2 diabetes*

And even believe exercise proper nutrition prevents type 2 cases anyway. Sure have. I'm highly suspicious information mixed doses way effective double mRNA - far I've seen one source that, questionable statistics place. Looks good true. 


And I'm sure mean rest it. There's good information much immunity stays (because, among things, even good idea much see), there's even less info actual Delta, ""several months"" pretty much would take implement vaccination passport system allows ""business usual"" give vaccinated best case scenario. ready time makes sense. 


Vaccination passports make sense vaccinated people community reasonably free new cases (this, political promises, staple voluntary vaccination significant part shaming non-willing ones getting vaccinated). They, see more, not. lowkey want healthcare/insurance system collapse never gonna get better exists now. Like 1500 cases day sign growth. Seems manageable. also weird period couple days first shot. timed perfectly getting BC expecting start bleeding couple days, day stopped taking pill. weird read wasn’t uncommon, knew stopping BC would make things weird anyway. vaccinated?  Or, anyone anywhere got vaccines. literally questioning right now. Interesting - I’d guess loophole - Delta, **self-insures** employees

I stand wrote companies don’t self-fund insurance :) bunch people get sick instead. would do? I'd let go. end day, personal decision. time persuasion over; everyone made minds. get figures useful some. They're important. average person gauge anything. much public panicked by. think people paying health insurance? They’re adults making choices. someone doesn’t wear seatbelt highway, rest us don’t pull make safer them. Triage Nurse: brings today? 
Patient: Fever, difficulty breathing, I’ve lost senses taste smell. think might COVID. 
Triage Nurse: vaccinated? 
Patient: No. 
Triage Nurse: God’s done. Next! point I'm one month full lockdown, national guard streets handing MREs Civil Defense water drums. shut down, pay everyone stay home, freeze markets come side. Yeah, stupid part. don’t like Putin all. He’s piece shit. broken clock right twice day. think meant 95% people died unvaccinated essentially willing risk lives safety precautions result, 95% people unvaccinated. 9kgosh 

Slang keeps getting weirder weirder they? number vaccinated dying might low .2%

So 1% chance dying disease general, vaccinated dead make .2% number, talking like .01 * .002 = .002% chance dying vaccinated.

So mean **sure**, ""some"" vaccinated people wear masks still dying COVID, but... many.

If numbers applied 600,000 died COVID US far, would 1,200 people, rather 600,000 died.

Saying, ""some vaccinated people dying COVID"", technically true, really give accurate depiction what's actually occurring. data coming less ""it's unvaccinated getting sick"" narrative holding up. Israel several months ahead us. vaccinated unvaccinated getting sick roughly rate. light end vaccine tunnel far looks like vaccinated less likely get severely ill although, considering trend, likely change well.  inconvenient uncomfortable times

No not. really need accelerate least 5-11, given havoc Republican shitheels like DeSantis Abbott wreaking schools. thought going quickly? can’t imagine unintelligent reason think that’d case.  ThaMouse: “The matter take seriously, boy, you. politics bore me! demeanor pouting child.” country way higher population happen case US? thought Fauci said possible. suspect kids they’ll try live kids rites passage. would devastated prom, enjoy senior year college friends graduate together. wrong many people afford endless stream N95 masks? Also given piss poor government signalling 99% folks dont realize N95 masks truly effective masks  FDA way slow. damage done time kids even get shots. Yes. Yes, does. higher viral load infectious individual others. And, rate transmission one individual much ~5-8 new infections, something cannot taken lightly. transmission rate high, takes initial infections kickstart explosion cases. wait see New Zealand looks month two. Delta getting foothold there, think current lockdown measures enough curb spread enough avoid total overrun healthcare facilities. Especially low vax coverage have. Passing virus onto many people per infected person leads exponential spread cases. Alpha bad enough that. Delta absolute monster comparison. Consider factors, play tape way through. taste schadenfreude. 

(It’s delicious.) Guess lockdown work okay, that's probably far read anyway. 


You act like Doctors never get shit wrong, like they're omniscient beings predict exactly everything go. They've already explained masks multiple times thought bad idea. abundance masks doctors would've went without. 


We saw great society handles inconveniences possible future supply chain issues toilet paper &amp; hand sanitizer &amp; first started. They're responsible leave next guy given chance.  Disney would end IP rights Florida Man^TM short we're truly fucked. Oh beautiful... spacious skies.... Reality check: literally everyone stayed home 3 weeks virus would’ve totally eliminated.

This also still case today. welcome. breakdown vaccination status hospitalisation / death? Florida actually appears relatively vaccinated, wave highly county specific (i.e areas low vaccination). Unfortunately think wishful thinking. People universal healthcare make opposite conclusion say, ""See? profitable companies can't even it, makes think lousy, corrupt government could better?"" Holy methballs speed man know it’s bad Texas NRA won’t even go there. According mom heard 95% deaths unvaccinated told yesterday. 

There's sizable chunk nation complete uninformed/misinformed. Mom Europe dying last two years able go. Thankfully good it. Head tap man That's meat supposed cooked consumption don’t need buy time anymore. There’s vaccines every vulnerable American months. hospital system would fine people gotten vaccines. 

The hospitals aren’t burdened states good vaccine rates. even close. Yeah, rush? /s boss, respected hell of, dropped line last fall. 


Are hiring? mean, last time checked Covid Delta R0 6 7, whereas flu around 1 2. think that’s plenty reason doubt flu likely C19 whoo! Life could dream  live, 3 feet. Asinine. Never underestimate stupidity, honestly fully expected shit. strong feeling(because plenty people told wouldn’t vaccinate) gonna drag it’s ass across next 3 years.  thought flu? Cancelling flu? Seems weak ask me. putting effort HARD! telling make appointment online GO SOMEWHERE?? They'd shot could order one uber eats. like 2142. There's huge difference voluntary drive lining kids vaccinated them, though. think OP envisioning polio vaccine clinics schools 50s. would fly today.  sympathy unvaccinated COVID patients. You’ve made choice, got rights, go cure yourself. We’re screwed, aren’t we? ""there’s reason walking around mask."" link

He said March 100 cases entire United States. right, reason wear mask there's maybe one case entire city maybe entire state, literally 0 cases. That's applicable 100k cases day.  Delta pretty nuts. care kids, 3 kids, recovered covid, fine. order millions kids die, half Earth's population would die. That's happening. may watched couple times… love PBS! really cool see new angle footage. Well that's good. Vietnam also buy one mRNA canidates dropped US market? People right trying discredit vote, essentially attacking peoples legitimate votes. How's different? I'm saying people lose freedom speech probably keep mouths shut. writers Constitution could never imagine social media rampant stupidity exist it? Why’s that? That’s spend lot time outside. really congruent? I’ve getting told recent spike much worse rest country. Yep. live near major hospital North Carolina, people regularly come across state see specialist here, even normal times. either we’re wearing masks requiring proof vaccination. Educate  U.S.: every college person fall. Make 2032. That’s percent means. 

In Alabama right now, 36.8% population fully vaccinated. 48.3% least first dose. 

But people died COVID Alabama, 95% unvaccinated. OK get it, get vaccine feed ramen. It’s time force anti-vaxxers get vaccinated. vaccine’s proven safe. Even apprehensive possible side effects ended getting vaccinated anyway nothing bad happened me(I J&amp;J vaccine). barely even typical side effects you’d expect vaccine(chills, low fever, etc) stories people tell health ruined vaccines either misleading outright lies anti-vaxxers literally threat public health. need start getting authoritarian fools. complain said authoritarianism, tell loved Trump attempted coup. wrong, Florida also rest country visiting last couple months. work tourism Central Florida week saw huge drop off. 100 people day 15. bet spike way down. scared people know point they’re willing get vaccinated.

So many afraid think genuinely believe whatever told them.  ask honest question?

Does ever get embarrassing, stupid pretend pose kind argument? basically relies conceit uneducated understand concept takes 6-8 words explain, go use pick fight something complex vaccine efficacy populations. Like that's gotta bit humiliating level, right? Either really stupid, pretend even though know not. 

The vaccines extremely effective safe - 90% hospitalizations unvaccinated people, huge point evidence vaccines favor, especially considering vaccine developed address primary strain currently circulating. reputable doctor would ever claim vaccine ineffective protect 100% recipients 100% time future mutations, especially outside efficacy trial environment recipients' medical histories cannot accounted for. Vaccine efficacy considered individual level - ""is reliably effective eliciting immune response protects disease"" - community level - ""if enough people vaccinated, help slow transmission level cannot vaccinated protected"" - course anyone sort functional understanding basic science knows need many people become vaccinated possible. Like real mouth breather understand that, know? problem. give everyone third vaccine shot Regeneron. tried buy N95 masks late January ""just case"" saw Home Depot completely cleaned out. realization.  …duh… told Pfizer pediatric trial unblinding would occur December unless EUA authorized then. 3 year old got second shot mid-July.

What prepandemic? One teacher per 25 students? (Frigging ridiculous start) 

The system flawed covid. single human possibly expected corral, connect with, educate many children. parents can't even handle 1-4 kids, lol.

This pandemic really showcasing flawed societal system is. said vaccinated weren’t dying. true.

Are numbers based anything pull thin air? Even without antibodies may well protected ways, like T-cells Wonder flip flop one trust Fauci????? Ramen noodles abundant food item jails prisons. definitely hot commodity. Pickles tuna packs however... honestly think large portion population wants many COVID rules remain place. mean, find plenty people reddit admit LOVING wearing mask public. Plenty want work office close, too. 

Even outside love restricted, quieter world COVID lockdown, lots people going act like amount COVID bad. Like we'll able eradicate like Polio. 

I'm believer vaccines. result, feel like hanging bunch vaccinated friends, way hell going wear mask. We're vaccinated Polio MMR, go around worrying viruses, we? Now, came home gathering felt like cold, started running minor fever, I'm going stay away friends loved ones, especially vaccinated. would flu. 

What's happening public health officials, rightly so, still concerned VOLUNTARILY UNVACCINATED people. 40% population still unvaccinated, still overwhelm hospitals, mention kill quite kids spreading around COVID unwittingly. 

Once pediatric vaccine kids 12 approved, I'm unlikely continue wearing mask. point, aren't' vaccinated, damn fault. Israel still hanging around 60% vaccination rate. many experts said previously, enough. 

I know Israel touted vaccination success story. one first start vaccinating, that's it. clickbait fear porn. listen Osterholm Update podcast said Minnesota DHHS tracking cases 9 events month July, outdoor events. 

I don’t anything specific, didn’t share specific details, would seem, Delta, outdoor transmission possible. 

I don’t think blanket mandate would necessary, outdoor events like concerts etc., might bad idea. recent really help much yet.

So 'despite recent booster shots' make much sense context. Kids vaccinated could potentially prevent closure’s happening? 

Unless feel since risk Covid small schoolchildren, closures shouldn’t even happening. I'd watch told son mid-2020, maybe 4 years, when, US, countries, people travel them, vaccinated, covid tests widely available become common, week/month going restaurant, theatre, movies, airplane, concert, sporting events, medical offices, going work school results back within minutes. Then, start say , control, ID covid positive immediately isolate provide treatment needed, prevent spreading virus. 
Until then, managing risk. There’s three South Bays CA. One SD, LA, Bay Area. Gets confusing Cool, thanks Wow, right! said month ago again, IMO many schools shutting back mid September. 2020, Dr. Fauci says Americans comply health safety measures pandemic reigned months. 2021, Dr. Fauci says Americans comply health safety measures pandemic reigned months. 2022, shit makes angry disappointed people. know people whose elderly parents/grandparents got it, one died widowed permanent health problems. whole family still refuses get vaccine. Knowing people, surprised, hard imagine could possibly make want rush asap get vaccine one else go loved ones did. Yes, likely. However, help some. I’ve already acquaintances gotten shot following approval. 

More importantly, private public enterprises willing mandate following approval. wasn’t impossible before, likely less pushback obstacles now. Beautiful women low standards want nothing escape? got none. Thanks anyway COPIUM 36.8% population fully vaccinated.

That jaw droppingly low. Therefore refutes study completely? Fauci says ...stopped listening. real question need ask is, “how many people must killed stop him?” Live life 365 part statement incorrect though? nothing wrote Vaccinated people aren’t ones filling hospitals. 95% willing go rollercoaster without safety belt strapped.

Funny enough, COVID 10x fatality rate polio.

You incorrectly assessed risk. county jail gave inmates value meal McDonald’s got shot. burden proof lies you. Authorities subject, like CDC Mayo Clinic, contradict statements, recommend masking outdoors social distance cannot maintained, reduce spread disease. reason recommend this, trying help us control spread Covid. 

If you’re going challenge guidance world’s experts subject, need least provide kind source supports argument.

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, you’ve provided none. US could largely now, society willing make sacrifices.

Vaccine mandates, passports, mask mandates, actual lockdowns appropriate, restricted international travel would done it. dissatisfaction caused gap people's expectations reality. could start explaining people long enough timeline get Covid. many unreasonable expectations course people going unhappy things go way want to. Yeah that’s true logic applied every vaccine that’s existence right now

What, can't  county jail gave anyone got quarter pounder meal McDonalds. mean yes, already established poor risk assessment, else trying say? Cant Abbot Texas Supreme Court overrule them? wont even allow mask mandates, makes think vaccine mandates fly? still gonna get that's case happen pandemics throughout history?

Probably even get close kids start getting shot. way many people unvaccinated yet. #same, lol Misguided message discipline. unvaccinated Americans think Covid vaccines  
threat health contracting virus itself, according

 Americans least likely receive Covid-19 vaccine mostly white,  
Republican less likely college degree, according  
Kaiser’s data.

Data lie. Brazil uses AZ Pfizer now, require 3 months doses. Uruguay uses Coronavac (21 28 days). comparison meaningless.  judging people based weight make sense. poor metric, details beyond start getting really invasive fast. 

I understand setting insurance rates based things people easily control, like smoking keeping vaccines, based things behavioral component, lot complicated that. Depends risky behavior defined as. going drinks weekend risky behavior? commuting long distances work every day risky behavior? Sky diving? Texting driving? Sex w one person? Eating fast food week?

We're gonna end place we're preventing folks normal things insurance company continue profit. You’re part reason people midst addiction don’t get proper help support. last time checked vaccines reduced chances become case something like 3x. downward progress - lower lower numbers collect data, recent stats Israel percent vaccinated among population among new cases looks even worse. two get closer, reasons allow something specifically vaccinated dwindle. 

I going preempt point post, forgot. Canada's vaccine situation different US, three distinct critical ways:

1. us used extended dosing intervals, found greatly boost antibody counts compared trial intervals.

2. good proportion us used mixed doses, shown generate potent immunity, especially cellular immunity generated viral vector followed mRNA.

3. us received vaccines relatively recently still near peak immunity levels.

A good majority Canadians several months away waning immunity, makes complete sense *now* immunity levels high, viral circulation low immunity whole system, surface, ""you're allowed get back normal life we've told you"". going case soon. already perceived many like ""if told - going punished"" - sides fence.

I think lot scared people havent truly accepted mortal yet. happens get older see many friends die. younger avoidance death seems permanent.

Perhaps Christian acceptance inevitability death makes people Christian states less concerned becuase state change simply chance acceleration inevitable. That's hypothesis. However noticed people states tend engage risky actions anyway.

I know gotten older accepted reality death, avoiding every chance becomes less important maximizing everyday. Also low crime clean air leads possibility charging cancer. lose limb. become liability insurance pay more. 15 year old received second vaccine July I'm wondering start think booster him. 

A booster ~60 days pretty early. I'm hearing recommendations US 8 months. Israel trialing 6 month boosters Pfizer strong results. leaning towards 6 months personally. meant shifting employer payment side employee premium per month $1000 month maxed out. companies (no idea Delta's like) bad expensive plans ($500+ family). Rather jail, I'd like see sentenced transporting dead COVID victims morgue. Although finding solid data unfortunate ones fatal reaction directly attributed vaccines, anyone truly believe numbers fact statistically alarming? point would significant amount concern among health medicine professionals, news agencies would reporting ad nauseaum. deaths inevitable. But, considering ~4.7 BILLION doses administered globally, amount people fatal reaction vaccines really appear infinitessimally small vs billions helping protect save. Thank issue is, drinking big problem compared COVID. 3 million people die year drinking drinking doesn’t spread like COVID.

Maybe. Idk. vert different use cases, normally. insane use monoclonals instead vaccine. Insurance companies way settled. Monetary penalties refusal coverage un-vaxxed going hammer need. correct? third shot received 8/19 CVS like first second shots? told testing delta beta vaccines adjusting dosage? thought illegal ACA.

why think that? read ACA, borrow opinion media? It’s terrible, like everything biostats, it’s it’s used. 

For example, say unhealthy, can’t think situation would exception. No? Quick Google search says 51.1% fully Vaccinated Lol... heart shaped donut clog heart. 

Seriously, though, like rewards. I’m much rolling spiked clubs unvaccinated (no vax job, insurance doesn’t cover, etc.) rather carrots, fun thing seems like optimistic time wasn’t even long ago. Ya know, pre delta hard get appointment vaccination popular. - literally ""kill them"" - see horror, undertakers see $$$ Sometimes frequent. insurance companies try incentivize issue like obesity giving people discounts employees exercise regularly fitness programs things like that. think something like obesity lot harder define something like smoking. say anything insurance companies, I'm talking doctors responsible clinical treatment. **do have** legal duty provide care.

 - simple triage healthcare? unvaccinated person coming treated placed end line given least priority vaccinated. Thats medical treatment besides COVID mean worry this. There’s reason encourage folks get flu vaccine every year. Fun fact mRNA vaccine supposed tested flu virus covid came along, decade worth research able implemented help speed vaccine production process.

Now covid much newer, deadlier, especially delta infection rate similar measles. take account communities extremely low vaccination rates, like look breakdowns state vaccination rates divided county, states vaccination rates 40% adults promising, section include approximately 150 individuals already received one three COVID-19 vaccine regimens currently available FDA Emergency Use Authorization United States: Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (also referred Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, Ad26.COV2-S), Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (also known mRNA-1273), Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (also known (BNT162b2). vaccine group enroll 25 people ages 18 55 years approximately 25 people age 56 years older. Twelve 20 weeks following initial vaccination regimen, participants receive single booster dose Moderna COVID-19 vaccine part trial.

25 people per sample group likely small gain approval. successful likely undergo many trials granted approval variant higher R0. cousin's wife physician's assistant telling family friends vaccine cause fertility issues. father-in-law 60's worried vaccine affecting sperm count, refuses vaccinated, wife, adult children. never said wasn’t fault. hurt you? father alcoholic growing up?

Mostly license plates NY, NJ, PA, it’s hottest month much covid. can’t fix stupid already do, carrot stick. Gym memberships number steps, example, lower health insurance costs. Delta could thing here. Raise everyone's insurance $200, give discount up-to-date vaccines. correct. They're testing 50mcg dose booster (original 100mcg). They've also developed variant specific vaccines Beta (called mRNA 1273.351) Delta (called mRNA 1273.617) along w/ half/half mixes w/ original (totaling 50mcg). remains seen variant specific forumlas creates actually provide significant benefit. Early interim data discussed preprint (and /r/covid19) overwhelming. 
 
So yea, 3rd shot current 100mcg formula work (and likely better) likely twice large booster they'll ultimately settle on. 
 
Pfizer's mRNA shot 30mcg booster dose. 
 
All booster info Moderna investor press releases: Lady, God denies 'right' teach. Period. Yes. posted something mentioning articles hospitals overrun without listing - many. laughed instead looking. stop racist incentive start? bet could buy decent house cheaper, that's sure. trials Pfizer submitted FDA conducted itself. 

It doesn’t mean evidence trials studies conducted outside entities. also may received breakthrough asymptomatic case months ago. mask mandate going make difference. Kids basically incapable wearing masks correctly even best intentions. class 50 kids would literally spend time fixing kids masks.

Secondly masks replace social distancing. need social distancing work. think schools even mask mandate dont facilities meet safely. 70% adults vaccinated US. Throughout pandemic told rate needed reach herd immunity. changed? get it. Delta’s insurance provider raising rates Delta offsetting rate change. I've heard ICU room $10,000 day. That's counting treatments machines everything. least $300,000 there... medical ethics work

And remember know analysis intial reported covid deaths revealed actually covid caused covid simply covariant.

Now course might true reported flu deaths however likelihood covid actually closer flu perhaps 2 4x.

And remember covid deaths caused ny forced mixing sick peoples infirm nursing homes due bad public policy. similar policy flu likely flu deaths would also much higher.

And dont forget flu covid deaths actually usually time shift event rather true state change. Every year matters like cancer kills would otherwise live 20-50 years.

Its comparative.

The end analysis though covid nothing like plague like people thought might be. Thank goodness.  great life Norway, lmao subreddit reading? front page story company finally charging unvaccinated people healthcare, we've anticipating months.

Moderna started rolling submission June 1

Moderna completed submission August 25


So 1 month behind (consistent always ). FDA highspeed/alleffort review Pfizer/BioNTech, unsure moderna

My guess early Oct, depending whether FDA prioritizing booster shot review Yea given delta ravaging children safeguards place protect infection certain school districts, it’s going go up. Freedom Fee Delta put hub anywhere else issues. Georgia would hurt Delta would. Booyah! Keep putting squeeze losers. break eventually. ""Necessity authorizes seems require measure, disorder infect Army . . . dread it, Sword Enemy."" -George Washington requiring vaccines smallpox army American Revolution.

 Sit down. soldier. would make go home, lack personal constitution stand something bigger yourself. Yeah. shifting towards vaccine + mask requirements go indoor public areas. hard eat properly worn mask, indoor-dining still something requires mitigations handle this, limited capacity, increasing ventilation filtering air. Also larger indoor events may need require vaccination + testing + masks case numbers high are. regions near zero even negative hospital capacity may need strict short-term restrictions. Remember told us Children dont catch covid? key _almost_. doctor put me, somewhere labcorp's site made sound like could order à la carte. imagine insurance covers via doctor order. noticed coded reason ""possible COVID exposure"" presumably reason. 

This test: ""Trimming fat"" great strategy winter hits Oh wow, thanks context! Didn’t realize fired comparison total employees. Makes sense then! Thanks clearing misconception had. Wouldn’t make sense name variant Spirit instead Delta? comes whatabouts.  time reproduces mutate. happens, greater chances one mutations something worse, also spread faster, either contagious evading vaccine. necessarily fatal though, far providing advantage virus main things would contagious able infect people already vaccinated. Delta raise health insurance costs unvaccinated employees $200 ""Bodies stacked ceiling""

And yet even dead, would still vote conservative... (sad smh)   Plus, adding COVID vaccine massive list vaccines _already_ mandatory service, really isn’t big deal. 

Anti-vaxers cry COVID vaccine it’s politicized soldiers required get full gambit vaccines _LONG_ time. drop bucket. hard parse statement.

We already 85 90% immunity many parts country due natural immunity. CDC estimated 130 million covid cases. dont know exactly many 18 months in, testing still atrociously bad.

I think testing every American, vaccinated not, every week.

I've tested takes like 15m time.

Secondly, statement true. never ""past this"". Delta 30 100 times transmissible but, importantly, vaccines increasingly poor job preventing infection spread. 99% job keeping hospitalized dying. apparently 40% preventing infection. numbers like genuinely wouldnt matter 100% Americans vaccine would still spread mutate (because vaccine sterilizing vaccine)

If ""getting past this"" means instead things like hospitals overwhelmed right country largely past this. couple states low vaccination rates (TX, FL) arguably poor policy decisions, getting slammed. live highly vaccinated area state single digit deaths past couple weeks    Put writing then. 85% America gets vaccinated stop masks Covid laws. know lot people would get vaccinated believed would put end Covid orders.

Right people concerned government overreach vaccine side effects. idiots actually don’t believe vaccine much smaller, much vocal minority though. Mother God. deliberate mismanagement unhinged governor criminal. Almost anywhere (that's third world status) safer Florida right now. Difficulty breathing means less oxygen baby. Simple concept IMO. federal level, state state varies. Staying home also option many places, funds care parents work, obstinate decided make rules virtual classes. Yes, perfect, also permanent, need get people vaccinated buy enough time get kids approved vaccines. Good.👍 want ""freedom"" horse medicine🤣? gonne cost you... Lots! Stackin bodies, stackin paper actually believe agenda? year ago calls covid nursing homes last one last month. That's really saying something ridiculous number nurses aids homes drank con's qoolaid never get vaccinated. far good considering folks arw frail living terrible conditions. 

My vaccine 9 months old exposure frequent. yet pop positive doubt dire say. curious, run county level state level? thought called food courts. would guess somewhere 500k 1.5 million. one reason make clear people conservative views, Republican and, even isn’t accurate. certainly don’t want anyone ever lumping likes Desantis. terms politicians either side, one worst.  solutions next major pandemic would likely involve significant changes current methods food production. assume global response climate change it’s nearly impossible time money invested make changes. audibly spit coffee saw this. colleagues also find funny lol. Thank you. can't EUA vaccines there's approved option.

From FDA issue EUA, **there must adequate, approved, available alternative** candidate product diagnosing, preventing, treating disease condition. potential alternative product may considered “unavailable” insufficient supplies approved alternative fully meet emergency need. potential alternative product may considered ""inadequate"" if, example, contraindicating data special circumstances populations (e.g., children, immunocompromised individuals, individuals drug allergy), dosage form approved product inappropriate use special population (e.g., tablet individuals cannot swallow pills), agent may resistant approved available alternative products.

Yeah fucking people over. Correct that‘s least America, need get life insurance. treatment unvaccinated? why? thought worried what's medications willing Russian roulette covid instead. Gives shits charge smoke, drink live dangerous lifestyles?

If need consistant. know inferior. think got big?  Yes issue availability, give surge per capita like US Italy issues availability. really hard comprehend? Yeah 2001 ACA vaccine manufacturers multi-billion dollar contracts government. free. paid taxes. completely fine. There's zero reason avoid mixing shots. Considering comparing cost medicine US, relevant compare average wage US.

Which actually something like 36k year even 40k. think party dumb enough that. think they're going keep cutting funding NHS make look inefficient obsolete, slowly start advocating privatization, ease ""burden"" NHS created. tax  Probably -- vaccines make fairly small proportion stuff immune system deals body already dealt non-vaccine stuff floating around.

Also, seriously consider getting childhood vaccines. Several still intermittent outbreaks several much serious risk adults children.  also pay higher insurance premiums. could wait years. Covid, one form another, stay.  Well before. risk there's weird allergy know about. Allergies treatable lookout. $1.8M would gross earnings time, taxes living expenses you’d nowhere close that. people outraging also ones see issue privatized healthcare would call federal universal healthcare ‘communism’ three affordable high quality health care. never surge point availability question.

So saying *there issue availability countries*.  vaccine prevents getting *really, really sick*. still catch get sick.

Staying home week mild illness way better way better hospitals, right **having close doors** intensive care beds left. Nope, there's absolutely additional risk that. body never vaccinated, infected various pathogens many times presented many immune responses. body way knowing difference. would lot worse US health care system set like Europe’s. health care system save city that’s nuked. bringing state health care system could worked really good argument. Totally agree winter gonna rough; guess, given slow vaccine uptake, lose another 300k US citizens Feb 2022. point, we'd ""only"" another 370k go reaching steady-state, would pace new normalcy end 2022.

Do know Gottlieb explicitly referenced little worst-case scenario analysis portion basis analyses? Ignoring fact cost technology massively inflated due problems, ventilators $30-$50k, get used many thousands patients decades replaced. two weeks usage add, say, $100 cost there.

How close $1.4 million now? “made killing”

Not vaccine 100% effective obviously, reduces chance death 99% risk hospitalization 97%. insurance companies make great point quick jab much ask want keep current rate. 

I’m still fence rate changes, etc., definitely see merit argument.

Edit: also obesity isn’t contagious. Another valid difference. Unfortunately, going prioritize prioritizing based whether done asked prevent first place going high order bid.  (I know nothing costs even less America)

I think fair question ask immune systems evolved adapt increasing variety/frequency pathogens encounter due same-day international travel made possible modern technology Pick metric doesnt BMI could something subjective like 1980’s classroom kids bully fat? yes, need pay higher premiums.  Someone needs nap! control weight, number factors affect ability control weight (both genetic, lifestyle) puts judging people weight far slippery slope setting insurance premiums based things people can't control, and/or giving insurers employers way much control people's personal lives. fat muscle. Well, time would fat, people actually athletic might problems metric used. Discounts physicals charging fat people more, especially nation fat people. Ironically, actually fat ever been, also think obesity epidemic sudden wave laziness taking US last 30 years. likely environmental causes work disrupting fundamental bodily processes interfering hunger regulation. yeah, slippery damned slope.

Having said that, getting jab hell lot easier quitting smoking, get jabbed. 5’10”, 195 lbs, muscular, low body fat. Apparently I’m “overweight” BMI 28. 3 days later, viral, ""heartwarming"" story patient chose allow condition become fatal save family $1M. hope learn disdain Economist much do.

In meantime, new evidence connect COVID-19 laboratory leak. Also, lot people, weight gain really hard reverse BMR low naturally, means hour rigorous exercise brings back average BMR. unless exercise like 2hrs day PLUS eat 1000 calories day, good luck losing weight. you’re building muscle time, you’re going really lose weight. like pooling costs like unvaxxed. pay fair average cost decision.

Someone suggested unvaccinated pay entire hospital bill need visit ER worse cruel option, since unvaccinated financially devastated others sniffles never caught unaffected. misinformed choosing get shot already comes increased risk death, shouldnt toss bankruptcy lottery (which less effective deterrent monthly bill). Yeah slippery slope, logic know oath is? one bound it? also bump cost life insurance? Since know… many people dying Covid? Pre-existing conditions aren’t thing anymore though? Cleveland clinics hospital system increases insurance premiums don’t meet minimum “being shape” guidelines. may vary state Ohio definitely discriminate Youre must one persons wrongly thinks word “but” negates anything previously said, im sure youre nice guy. Spoiler: won't

They'll scream cOnSitUsHuN Facebook start GoFundMes. alternative view happen hospital hallways become full corpses? mean, starters completely left technology there. 

But I'm debate costs, I'm pointing maintain semblance correctness get upvotes piling here. People many different reasons wanting get jabbed. young healthy people natural immunity prior infection. plenty vaccinated people pieces shit, look Gov Cuomo example. vaccinated gives confidence infected negative test three days ago. hole unvaccinated slip (contracted COVID test) much larger hole vaccinated (a breakthrough case).  certainly hope correct. knocked multiple diseases past/present mandates.

The bummer sometimes took generation common mandates school mandates.  issue hypercondriact ( anxiety issues health always go doctor thinking something might seriously wrong even though ) already many worries vaccine long term health effects FDA approved mRNA never used humans companies liable kills . worries me. Living anxiety jab even anything. else lied about. know arm explode 6 months ? Almost everyone work refusing take vaccine. actually gets sick transmit kids. People still complain still get infected forget ""who FDA listen them?"" need new job. 

We many people got Covid, surprisingly one died yet. live here. Sigh. even Johnston county parents freedom group. Seriously. dumbest dumb.

Yes, life insurance pay directly beneficiary, bypassing estate.

I've got beaches way closer. go parks. means I'm going. doesn’t make better… paid actor-takers two random questions I’m hoping get rough answers since “hot” thread today:

1) nobody able publish information vaccine efficacy month vaccination? data available? enough vaccinated people infections past months start understanding waves like prevented future boosters x # months. 

2) tests falling cliff US? close peaking issue getting tests? we’re peaking I’d expect 2-3 week plateau rounded top due school starting sharp fall like we’ve seen past. also think Polio vaccines terrifying?

Yeah South Dakota far highest rate case increases country right now. fact, rate increase dropping areas US. *inherently* convince money all. convince interests worth addressing legislation. fact Covid reinfections still quite rare, breakthroughs, still pretty rare itself, appear common reinfections.

""We know need it, can't two weeks rules made up."" altering compensation based medical status is, literal violation Americans Disabilities Act, certinatally violation spirit law.

They already this, not. fact also violates HIPPA essentially compelling employee restricted compensation divulge confidential medical information.

No discussion insurance company doctor. 

Your employer asks proof vaccination....like already many fields, school, even certain allowed, 100% provide precedence kinds medical discrimination.

This already allowed.

[new today presents nuanced complex view. say ""Vaccination produces greater amounts circulating antibodies natural infection"" antibodies Evolution b-cell antibody generation said end two months vaccine continuing 11 months natural infection. Antibodies said fade 5 months natural infection 

Basically, everybody wrong everybody right different ways. Whoever says knows exactly going lying. questions appear settled: vaccines produce antibodies natural infection. Antibodies fade rather months both. produce memory b-cells capable generating improved antibodies years future. study cited report finds b-cell improving process stops weeks vaccines continues months natural infection.

This obviously last word subject. TLDR: Vaccines produce antibodies natural infection fade away months. produce b-cells work improving future antibody response, however natural infection said carry b-cell evolution several months longer vaccines.

Incorrect - provision ACA forces insurance companies cover specific procedures - ACA requires insurance companies provide basic coverage general medical help.

Money talks. know smokers explicitly allowed ACA. heard obese people ""conditions"". health insurance asks smoker, sure premium difference ""no"" ""decline answer"", ""yes"" cost $50 (per month think). Nobody asked obese, could probably find out. pharmacist couple weeks ago got fired selling fake vaccine cards $10.

Also worth mentioning Soviets exact thing.  definitely depend area, 10k day regular hospital bed Several companies already cost differentials based smoking status; job involves designing desired rate structure. try incentivize healthy behaviors instead increasing rates obesity. instance, many companies programs pay monetary rewards BMI BP improvements. I’ve one company ask rate decrease designed employees meeting healthy metrics. provide improve health metrics get lower rate retroactively, it’s smart design. I’ve seen once. Yeah bro worries.

There's legal rights spouse entitled to, like making medical decisions incapacitated and.... uummm... can't compelled testify court specific way... and... eerrrmmmm... get throw party stops Boomer relatives making little snarky comments.  Moderna best vaccine. statistics show Moderna best one delta. 


What mean follow science? data straight says Moderna best one. following science. 



Now terms getting booster there’s lot factors come play. 


1. got covid 2 weeks ago science says antibodies last months. 


2. CDC says get 8 months first vaccine. Considering didn’t even allow everyone get vaccine late April early may. would mean get December. 


3. Last year major spike December/January assume thing follow again. 


4. Globally people haven’t even gotten first vaccine it’s bit unethical getting booster. 





Considering points. say fuck CDC recommendations waiting 8 months. get booster November prepared outbreak happens December. November also around time antibodies getting covid run out. 

Just FYI acting everyone shitting isn’t going change peoples minds getting vaccinated. That's really true. brainwashed-idiot faction thinks way. rest us entirely aware system dogshit, there's thing ""good"" insurance here, lack ability change system. Well come vaccine problems suppose could entertain argument.

So, theoretically, sick partner could rack $500,000 medical debts passing away, estate worth $250,000, surviving spouse would SOL. Whereas, divorced prior medical condition, widowed spouse wouldn’t hook whatever debts deceased’s estate accrued. 

This speculation part, though. I’m also lawyer. And, like mentioned, I’m sure estate planning processes utilized specifically handle situations like without loophole divorce, I’m fuzzy details. should.

You’re going make health decisions pandemic based articles read Reddit? cut chase explain that, system/test/definition flaws, doesn’t mean it’s meaningless. BMI imperfect, tests measures are. extremes (high low) it’s usually quite clear, get closer defining “normal” value, everyone fits that. That’s biostats works. 

Example: someone tests negative covid, 100% covid? No. make test “meaningless”? No.

For rest medicine, like every test order, every physical exam finding, every feature someone’s history, etc.

If better system BMI, would love use it. would educate saying it’s meaningless - look alternatives / drawbacks / benefits / etc. Good.

Every state US (ok maybe all) unique variants, one, pop different dangerous Delta.

Unfortunately, appears Delta first appeared India, high population high population density country, also issues public health general healthcare, Delta appeared major vaccine deployment India.

So may countries similar issues India, knock wood, messed confluence everything happened India-- high population, high density, relative lack sanitation health infrastructure compared countries, vaccine. took lump sum states statutes limitations medical debt, paid $10 month years debt would legally expire (they tell has, might figure out).

And medical debt affect credit score. It’s like every country. like US friend Australia booked three friends shots one knew keep looking Right, I'm thinking what's stopping employers deciding tomorrow they're going deducting hundreds dollars paycheck.

I know health insurance benefit outlined contract employer pays 80% it. I'm wondering contracts structured allow employers raise costs like this. implement they’ve already implemented price hike unvaccinated. What’s stopping applying every employee? what’s stopping removing people get vaccinated? You’re gonna tell huge corporation like delta airlines gives rats ass employees? It’s study doesn’t know answer questions like smokers higher insurance. point vaccine 'when get covid"" if. getting vaccine purposely taking steps prevent getting sick. **have** pay it. don’t, hospital sells debt collection agency. hunt take everything own.

But hospital, get money think fact children pulled schools early 2020 gave people false sense security children catch transmit it. think children's infection rates 2020 low virtual hybrid in-person/virtual.

Edit: lesson learned; don’t use Greek symbols company name they’re used lots stuff Nope, brief comment it. Delta Airlines incentivized vaccinations offering $20,000 (or $50K forget) lottery. disagree. one impressed amount upscaling production EU, known bureaucratic nightmare most.

Thanks extra vaccine production, get 2nd vaccine next monday rather month originally supposed be.

What weird municipalities pretty bad informing people chance rebook second shot way earlier, abundance unused timeslots... Anyone least 8 weeks since 1st vaccination walk beginning monday get second shot basically Someone last week assured plenty! Weird? Lol nothing left estate, believe declares bankruptcy goes away basically.  Debt passed along next generation.  $200 month get health insurance delta. Anyone spouse's plan opt company health insurance getting billed extra money.

I'd also assume instant start charging more, people drop instead paying extra money. Forms “MEGA-ULTRA DELTA CORONA COVID”!!! survival rate 98%…..yes kicks butt might disable life.
But alive Following numbers complex you’re making seem. doable read reports understand numbers. Going med school doesn’t give unnatural ability read scientific papers science isn’t nearly complex seem think.

The issue people lazy look numbers read headlines news sources didn’t read reports themselves.  simple really. They. chose. not. to.  bet hired Corona beer's PR guy. He's shit could prjbalh handle it. kept Northwest name instead 1. Seatbelts prevent death.

You realize cant get 100% protection *anything*. black white. Look Ontario's numbers youll see 7x likely catch covid unvaccinated 22x likely end ICU.

Next time put stats instead saying black white statements. 

For example: chance dying toilet holding newpaper Sunday slim 0% Friendly reminder anyone needs hear it: **each state Statute Limitations medical debt.** state 3 years. time collectors might still try get it, absolutely obligation pay. medical debt ruin life, try run clock making partial payments, missing payments etc.

Unpaid medical debt hurt credit score 7 years - depending situation might acceptable alternative. Accounting misuse part designing good system. it’s easy abuse it’s good system. say system okay. talking strictly dollar amount bills accurate. guy replied originally thought actual amount owed. Yeah, know details friends insurance, luckily insurance makes doses $5 each. However, insurance changing soon, he's student insurance university, I'm hoping finds something good, least terrible new job Well, would made difficult understand delta which. misremembering someone post thread guy r/legaladvice asking could anything it? friend (we're American) travelling US years back got car accident. ER overnight x-rays done etc, thankfully relatively fine. bill around $20K, remember correctly. Thank God smart enough get excellent travel insurance trip, insurance company covered whole thing. Meanwhile partner dislocated shoulder snowboarding here, went ER x-rays MRI done, shoulder put back in, painkillers, bill like 29 euros. whole healthcare system US baffles one biggest things I'm thankful I'm American. country definitely perfect, least lose homes declare bankruptcy medical bills. whatever merit worth, covidestim, site Gottleib likes point lot, recently put model 25 50 states spread rate less 1.0. talking about? Don’t weird. honest idea much month ICU ventilators costs, I'm rolling bandwagon poking seems ridiculously expensive healthcare costs US.

We've got house price crisis country - sure US dollars average prices Auckland million NZD. Well, knew healthy 38 yr old woman died Covid. know 20 year old formerly healthy guy extremely ill. American? pretty good coverage Canada. course there’s 600,000 US citizens died it, although likely young, healthy people died - there’s probably still enough number concern people.

Perhaps wasn’t explained terms remember understood well. look news articles vaccines   = 94% effective 

Most news articles read explain fairly often well enough readers understand. COVID hand? fuck dick medical insurance industry treat non-vaccinated people like smokers. Lot folks probably gonna hit round two winter thought safe caught last year.

Good lesson here. Even people vaxxes need booster. shit rough. Instead, Frank Reynolds made virus video. lobbying completely outlawed, less informed legislative branch. would bad lot emerging industries. Hard enough get people wear masks indoor.
Btw restaurants (at least area) anything limit diner distancing servers w/o masks.

To honest, probably good idea get curbside delivery. gig work get see all.  say fuck CDC completely failed us. 


1. beginning fucked making tests causing many people die. 


2. said masks don’t work told us get it. btw scientists Asia recommending everyone get it. 

3. Finally, said please wear mask. even 50% country vaccinated said “masks required” gave free everyone. 


So yes fuck CDC. don’t comparing anti-vaxers anti-maskers ridiculous. It’s almost like ignored everything said focused saying fuck cdc. 


Nothing said goes science don’t focus lied? Additionally, obesity isn’t transmissible vaccine obesity exist. We're well, national holidays next month (Sept 18th) normally date people travel party lot, much like USA July 4th, we'll see country prepared end surge cases. still know delta around significant numbers managed less controlled. 

Today also announced 1 million people already got booster shots. Yeah real scary convincing anti vaxxers get vaccinated. mitigating cost covering them.  Yeah. see 30th birthday party September. cousin kinda stubborn. said thought going die covid. vaccinated yet. really want explain her, screenshots real people groups I'm contracting covid again, bad experience. get vaccinated wish would listen me. pretends watch tv, care politics, fox news channel see time. hard time believing mind guided programming watches. nursing, along cops gym teachers, preferred profession school bullies they're positions power others, especially marginalized you. folks take attitudes rest life report many hundreds thousands deaths caused late, absent inadequate masking, isolation contact tracing programs

Yeah would really hard. could probably pin hundreds thousands early lack efforts led massive spread.  brother asked Delta serves Corona beer planes. data support? disregard looks like (I'm worldmeter) completely changed reporting like 2 weeks ago, I'm sure behind. surprised governor something Right, seem bad guy stupid guy something extremely stupid admits it. seems setting smarter future good fortune future. That's good enough. need fired. would say anti-vaxxers getting large dose personal responsibilty. need universal Healthcare asap totally understandable, hilarious use aeroplanes travel accident risk 1%. get it. Great response. Especially bit everyone receiving quality treatment. I'm awards pretend gave gold.  no. thinking arby's like it. guess devil's advocate rate low enough entirely within margin error earlier tests less effective tests. fucking Arkansas, gotta ask?

I imagine training sessions corporate communications calling Delta variant, suspect note given interviewer: “Delta corporate communications agrees televised interview provided broadcaster ask questions about, refer it, Delta variant.” exposure coronavirus that's even question worth considering. course people exposed covid infected covid. That's scientific question. like saying goalie saved goal even though ball coming way. Thank you. wild...every parent understands unsolicited advice judgements come along new baby add covid everything explodes. Damned damned don't. appreciate validation say. Maybe it'll remove society. Pre-delta, probably correct.  good insurance cover vast amount hits co insurance expected. 'You signed line mine.'

First words DI uttered wrong. many shots first week camp. matter wanted not. Orders baby. Orders. think masks magical COVID-proof barriers, absolutely not. every single person world wore mask 24 hours day, COVID would still spread. That’s funny, scheduled mine yesterday 9/4 6 months looking data figured best figured CVS wouldn’t care. Sadly probably one Absolutely, opens door start making overweight employees pay fair share since obesity costs Delta more. Win-win! Pushing treatment vulnerable population FDA warned people use? 

This ethics violation. Inmates can’t exactly “shop around” better care; ability make informed voluntary decision compromised. Good. Let's see people feel healthcare right. sage advice. “In together” “heroes” turned “not way, fuck em all” real quick Florida reported 42,722 COVID deaths.
[CDC excess deaths 40,313 range.

California reported 65,228 COVID deaths.

Texas bad one. 53,662 reported COVID deaths.
CDC excess deaths 61,185 75,851.

Of three biggest states COVID deaths (CDC breaks NYC New York analysis), Florida's numbers excess death range.

We counting everywhere. understand health insurance? deductible high average $3000-6000. way? thought well detailed sourced Everything? think goes nature? Deer dancing wolves around blueberry bush?  “The Research Triangle, simply Triangle, common nicknames metropolitan area Piedmont region North Carolina United States, anchored three major research universities: North Carolina State University, Duke University, University North Carolina Chapel Hill, located cities Raleigh Durham town Chapel Hill, respectively.” confusing all, you’re trying read like sentence book, that’s contextually wrong way read I’m due till next month I’m gonna wait official approval anyways use brain read headline contextually lmfao  That’s nothing company wife works raised health insurance 100% 3 months ago they’re ones health insurance company. hope can't get x&amp;y health reasons get exemption.

They're lucky consequences extend beyond employement. How? insurance policy $1200 family deductible $3k OOP limit. total 4200 paid, pay anything else, even 10 million...  realize mentioned insurance covered right? Well vast majority individuals family's also insurance handles it. higher deductibles course 1-3 years actually ends much cheaper higher taxes even max out. Let's use Germany example. Someone making 100k euro year average 45% tax deduction vs 120k USD year (rough conversion) around 35% tax. extra 10% Germany amounts additional $1000 usd month taxes. know amazing insurance could get $1000 month? Talking basically everything covered near zero deductible. Especially 20-50s..

Your model much healthcare costs inaccurate without modeling much typical individual pays. works favor group people 50-70k year range get little extra aid health insurance. sub 50k use year get additional discounts deductibles premium via healthcare.gov along lower taxes  Work related seems top inspiration people simply get vaccine apathy. big rush workplaces started allowing vaccinated workers wear mask, there'll another due financial incentive. apathy cost $200 (assuming get month), I'm sure makes feel terrible. Yeah born April 2020. Literally right started. nurses 4x day, basically times also nap. told friends straight saw nursing toddler keep comments unless vaccine haha. live TX know trying kill everyone point. Honestly think convince country vaccines mandatory. mean, get it. super fucking brainwashed would become psychotic vaccine given you, fine, don't. That's causes nut jobs get fake immunization cards shit. can't fix misinformation, can't stop fox news. least feel like choose vaccinated, allowed interact members society, especially KIDS. Yeah, means i'll able get booster November rather January. 

Given live PA, officiate swim meets winter side job, sixth month wait far better me. protect way protect cold flu.

I’m tired hearing lazy hand-off. 

I’m immunosuppressive therapy autoimmune disorder. I’ve never worn mask cold flu season; didn’t need to. I’d still catch wasn’t life-threatening like Covid. Millions folks like would probably tell thing. 

**POINT BEING**, pointing us doesn’t excuse anyone else’s lack responsibility community. 

Why hard people comprehend? coworkers still denial, talking illegal fire employees vaccination status.

I sure hope actually look employee protections right work state, something tells get bogus law expertise idiot facebook. say ""technically"" telling reader precise using standardized method determining whatever talking about. informal.

In case determining medical obesity, thread about, measure BMI.

Now whole host problems talk regarding BMI whether good measure, right measure, etc. many references obesity contexts, but, good bad between, use BMI right now.

Not big deal imo may explain post taken Honestly don’t give crap that. spent year trying help people see aren’t willing help others. got vaccine help avoid mess irresponsible people, get Covid spread CHOOSE to, die…well, bought tickets. Unger.

Pretty sure Congress would pay bed. paying everything else already. going really solid argument used court charges drinking driving, stealing, drug possession etc brought up. 

He also may need read constitution couple times. Probably both...I know 12 people died local hospital system alone yesterday....and 74 total past week... numbers never going accurate unfortunately... people worried government pfft! Watch companies, they’ll charge pay you. Lololol Yeah, mine alarmist 2.5. don’t tell anyone still nursing don’t want judgement-but really, best can. kid turned one right s**t hit fan, home since. don’t know breastmilk helps, can’t hurt, guess…I know recommends nursing least 2. nurse morning, prior nap, prior bedtime, hope getting benefit vaccination. child want do! That's people choose get vaccine, also including people genuinely can't get whatever reason, right?

Like kind people genuinely can't get vaccinated also kind people probably really, REALLY need health insurance. Everywhere public health setting start, I've told patients protected weeks second dose. Obviously full truth bit complex that, decent enough approximation. Patients days dose 2 definitely count partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated. We've known since earliest days vaccine distribution COVID. 

Anyways, I'm clinical immunologist, answer questions may have. However, would encourage actually read links posting. I’m sure that’s it.

But think month now, transmission lower FL northeast. 😎🤏 stupid know do? friend says antivaxxer going cause storm require children. repeats talking points antivaxxer. got vaccinated, husband did, family did. gotten children shots. weird worst pandemic 100 years people think there's wild conspiracy wanting vaccinate children. get it. Kids get covid super low risk serious disease. non zero number risk it? Post viral syndrome joke.  Shocking!  going entertaining watch anti-vaxer's heads explode news. next variant agree you; record, think fertility link. scientific perspective, disappointed article: dismisses side effect ""stress."" would interesting understand hormones regulate immune system fluctuate immune response.  Yeah lot people it’s necessarily massive point contention get vaccinated, don’t really care covid it’s low priority. Make enough nuisance vaccinated lots will.

Full stop. He’s politically (and personally) aligned Gladys trying help save face career-ending, unmitigated fuck inflicted country. Thank Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri Arkansas. also refrain calling Delta variant used letter abbreviation avoid calling name, aha Delta sure since took second Pfizer month ago

I sure works. find variant get sequenced separate procedure. work aerospace company ~5000 employees globally. retail operations small number customer service reps sales people would considered ""frontline"" guess. 

All US sites weekly testing several month earlier year. Recently site work resumed weekly testing everyone regardless vaccination due couple breakthrough cases. Personally, like old people priced insurance.  vaccine, won’t need monoclonal antibodies. Florida strategy let people get sick make take long iv treatment. It’s expensive too. 

See monoclonal antibody treatment reserved people can’t get vaccinated poor immune response. 

This another money grab certain people able access. read statement. due respect Academy, also experts perhaps public health policy hasn’t considered Academy (like maybe skipping steps approval process might inspire confidence vaccine fuel vaccine hesitancy). event, don’t think disparaging FDA helpful. fair. I’m sure agenda. know liar I'm calling out.

Quit bullshit. Imagine wanting 50 dollars twin minutes work. 2 hours somehow get stuck behind wreck near Cullman. see many comments ""I've got shots, I'm taking precautions anymore."" know *know* still get sick infect others, *want* know, seems way common mentality going keep pandemic going knows long. swear. New York little places get tested everywhere. someone lives Florida went get test recently, wait car outside Doctors office hour. almost like want test people. Florida Board Education directed withhold state funds monthly basis amount school board members' salaries school districts response, Broward listed nine school board members, $46,773 annual salary. Alachua County provided board member salaries $40,287 four board members.

These folks don’t make tons money (which another whole topic entirely) it’s like saying I’m going give money candy here’s new car. trivial amount money that’s withheld come lots different places (including federal government bc apparently states don’t handle bidnass) wants money attention. fired screwup publicly spreading lies FL COVID reporting. didn’t listen colleagues sand didn’t listen bosses bad call also bad job. went made show invented bs colleagues shady, pro-death assholes.

It's probably overzealous, think nefarious. vaccine mandate would better, likely would rouse opposition.  Lol…you care way much this. Good talking ya, good night! Fauci American hero. Trump American zero. Definitely question patient’s doctors, Reddit. Ask blunt, honest answer sugar coating, they’ll usually lay you.

Overweight factor, much actual obesity. Mid 50’s isn’t good. sick enough admitted isn’t good, especially right sickest admitted. unvaccinated definitely good. long holding aren’t intubated, there’s still hope. logic would never isolated originaly. delta healthy people rarely got seriously ill either. high risk people, can't even take vaccine Wow. much quid pro quo. hope result Australia stops helping US half arsed wars start around gobe. Eh bullshit. 2 weeks wasn’t solving anything. logic doesn’t work vaccinated people spreading covid . much Lot .  25 percent Los Angeles new cases fully vaxxed.  Many unreported . cannot argue herd immunity. argue unvaccinated folks getting severe cases burdening hospitals disproportionately. foreseeable it’s acceptable simply run beds blame sick people dumb decisions made vulnerable smart forward thinking, clearly much average person. sure knew better everyone!  well catch (lower percentage unvaxxed)

Correct, much lower rate unvaxxed? significantly lower?

At lower rate, even infected. [reduces length  (vaccinated people clear virus faster aren’t contagious long) [even Ct “viral load”, vaccinated people less culturable virus actually *less That’s media’s fault bad headlines. Governor’s fault. Pandemic Boogaloo We’re right UGA. Got news today we’ll full capacity stadium vax/testing reqs ZERO mask mandates. Athens effectively Raccoon City game weekends.  current variations, surely variations develop around world upcoming years.  Yeah, collaborate Zoom calls inside office masks shitty mood vs home comfortable excited work.  That's reality works buddy. ICU full affects dumb ass too.  mean yes leave beds open case know, people absolute morons emergency like let's say cancer patient, although sadly said cancer patient discharged way faster doctors would like thanks morons.

Nevermind fact Texas already asked 2,000 nurses.

Beds one thing, staff another whole ass problem that's going keep growing long people stupid get vaccinated even FDA approval.   Mask mandates vaccine free available even rural communities US since spring/early summer. I'm talking specifically people affected covid. vaccine still infected point need hospitalization, believe point given priority someone infected covid chose get vaccine.  hit nail fkin head.

Hopefully everybody hold health issues months hospitals room staffing take care them. Great point! Glad expert qualified build response based real data would thought risk losing taste smell, organ damage would enough material risk, would wrong. Telling people waiting gets benefits probably good thing also need people get booster shots 8 months previous shots. Antibodies fight covid infection? 🤔 feel like quick shot could thing..... know harder appears be. several month gap adult clinical trials ending kid clinical trials starting think could shortened situation this. Pfizer adult data finished November, I'm sure would shortage participants ready go December/January. recall listening biologist make claim survival fittest, survival friendliest; form strong communal bonds neighbors also species win long run, genetically speaking. borne research showing dominant chimps less genetic lineage downstream successful (friendly) bonobos, example.

Covid gives us good parallel- people refuse take vaccine show independent strength whatever instead best community experiencing environmental pressure much greater vaccinated, long term ones choose right thing community get vaccinated end remaining gene pool longer, average, antivax idiots. Basically. Usually implies deep expertise specific area. Johnson’s Johnson’s

Johnson &amp; Johnson I'm honestly sad nobody pointed ""spreading"" joke. developed nations doubt will. Maybe scientifically should, socially people fed up.   vent comment, I’m really tired friends family don’t want get vaccinated, one reason another, usually boils fed misleading information. mother, got ass kicked COVID, big anything fucking vaccine prevent covid. sister trying hawk propaganda garbage me, citing research, can’t find ANYTHING corroborate claims.

Just hour ago, tell friend it’s right unvaccinated, it’s someone else’s right choose close contact you. 

I’m tired. best! love state.   2025 estimate unvaccinated dead? 20% positivity calling bullshit that. I'm glad made effort, never busy times went. surprise see close. Scientifically, yeah. Human behavior wise? People aren’t going live like much longer. Even masks probably going gone far that. Right, point people vaccinated walk get one anytime choose to. Lack access issue US months. Idk downvoted it’s even comparable. job market leaps bounds better 4 years ago CDC would love track it. States cooperate CDC power enforce. Heck, CDC recommends masks, yet idiot governors literally pulling funding schools schools mandate masks. CDC can't force reporting. CDC budget manpower. Lol boundary need draw  love make like going back WFH giving letting covid win. fucking intelligent move make care employees physical mental health. virus exposed much company give fuck employee. Think covid like cigarette smoke. someone smoking, close enough wind smell it, congrats covid! 

If listened experts before, stop now? idiots really thought we'd woods last year. Remember experts saying vaccines year away, good vaccine coverage would take another 6 months? That's _before_ delta variant hit.  like rerun show one likes constantly on.

I zero sympathy left someone refusing get vaccinated, getting sick, change heart death bed. That's it. Yes are. fully legal, especially live right work state. Yay! Oh that's exciting! Mid September guess. Two weeks labor day darwinism winning   pandemics end. 1918 flu isn’t pandemic anymore. Covid isn’t going away totally, won’t live rest lives like this. Center Countering Digital Hate study months ago found *12* individual people responsible 65% covid misinformation social media. fascinating study really emphasizes ease teeny tiny minority people push batshit crazy insanity social media. can't keep blaming shot sex 4 months? mean point lime watching bizzaro tv show. run things say mouth hangs open. think run double blind tests find *ties off* Almost getting boring, yet, it’s still fascinating underestimated central war rhetoric successful masking campaigns 1918 influenza. 

Those refused mask (and many) openly labeled traitorous, harming war effort. midst major war (with military drafts, austerity mandates industrial mobilization) perhaps could tempered NPIs last year better compliance vaccination. He’s giant shit stain WI politics years. feel young family, it’s hard muster sympathy asshole.  Better COVID brain fog.  Ok, apply logic anything ever leave bed.

Some people immunocompromised, vaccine doesn’t work well. cases, unvaccinated could well directly cause death someone trying right thing. aged, another group typically works quite well, may work perfectly because, well… old that’s happen.

You can’t really around last year half still ignorant fact repeatedly stated vaccines 100% effective, it’s important everyone get reduced transmission, comes fewer cases fewer mutations fewer deaths involved. That’s false. guy still tv every day giving covid updates. find flip flop every issue Who, cdc current past president . going go away recognize pathetically low death rate, worth shutting economy (or even preventing us going social events) survivable illness. care sycophantic DNC - everyone secretly hates lockdowns, hates masks, hates restrictions.

But yeah, I’m you. Transplant patients turned said transplant refuse take health seriously. They’re going give liver someone refuses stop drinking alcohol.

We already make decisions. Prioritizing vaccinated people isn’t much different. Granted, people hospitalized vaccinated, it’s still concern.

And feel like anything non covid related deserves seen first, someone shouldn’t die heart attack, unvaccinated people overwhelmed hospitals. :/ It’s shitty decision make, ignoring medical professionals saying get vaccinated. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

First, antibodies always wane infection vaccination. NORMAL anything. body memory cells make infected again. antibodies actually lot protection compared T-Cells. real deal, kill cell infected SARS prevents infection lead disease.

second, CDC tends test individuals qPCR test they're infected vaccinated. problem? vaccines really protect infection. protect disease, hospitalization, death.

another positive note: parts spike T-Cells recognize changed all. Meaning immune evasion. think missed chance, use word delta lot, owned something exactly position like never elected. government meant enforce anything police completely unaccountable anything? simple fact unless significant percentage population vaccinated COVID-19—we could stuck fighting virus many months even years come. time public private sectors come together, listen science, mandate vaccination. 
“The AMA robust policy vaccine mandates - tool used across U.S. around world generations defeat polio, measles, vaccine-preventable disease. now, urge similar mandates defeat COVID-19 pandemic.

These studies serial interval actually include minimums, ""source"" seemingly unforthcoming. Insane done research semi-famous incident Australia found someone contagious 24 hours, panicked locked entire state. later found person lied history serial interval much higher. Ever since I've entirely assumed 1-day serial interval impossible. laughed said that. obviously going much much longer, wanted give people hope temporary.

Vaccines, especially third booster help prevent Delta. It’s never going away, everyone vaccinated, even Delta would overall nonissue. 

If rest country gets infection rates down, masks come again. seems like surge picking back up, mandate comes back.

Anyone who's unemployed year get Obamacare deal. Still quite right. 

Vaccinated people much less likely infected, yes. Potentially 20x less likely boosting, least 5x less likely mRNA 2-dose vaccines healthy people. 

Vaccinated people significantly less likely spread covid infected. completely missed media headlines, backed research. Peak viral load - likely peak symptoms - comparable, vaccinated people recover much faster average. 

Of course, know vaccinated people also significantly less likely require hospitalizion die infected. narrative tends overdo effect, though - smaller protection infection. think so, half family got live affected large cities. Number 1 hospitalized rescinded pretty quickly. think overly cautious one sure long term effects. sick dog two days second dose. worth it. 

But becomes vaccine need take yearly, would prefer side effects getting way less. clinical studies available time support outside 2 months post first shot infections. looked pre-prints available data.  recall heavily weighed previous vaccines initial doses follow booster 6 months far better research.

Discrimination illegal. Discrimination basis race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender sexual orientation illegal Title 9.

But everyone discriminates time- go grocery store discriminate brands products time. Perfectly legal so.

In fact, also discriminate hiring people, based things like criminality. is, want bank robber, example, bank guard. Perfectly legal.

Here, insurance companies evaluate risk noticed non-vaccinated people tend higher chance covid hospitalizations. Therefore, order profitable business, adjusted rates according health practices.

He’s probably right individual level. Maybe talk collective level (low-probability event + massive scale = problems). 

Scary anecdotes scorched-earth approach. He’d probably recognize never trust again. discriminating based religion?

no, insurance companies makes business decisions based pure math. pry people's lame excuses endangering lives.

For example, cry hoarse drinking driving mandated religion. still higher risk injury death, govt can't force insurance companies insure lower premium - entire industry would die of! lol Sorry anti-vaxxers, free market spoken!   hope one good thing comes this, country's workforce recognizes badly exploited is.

Are impression covid eradicated? get impression. long term germ continued series variants humanity forever. one ever said could eradicated. Government can't really ""force"" people get vax.


But insurance companies going start.

No different smoker. biz treating preventable diseases choose risk might well anything instead something half-assed, tbh. term looking ""stop loss"". There's whole different set rules lol. example, stop loss insurers exclude individuals, called pandemic eye opening. naive amount selfish, proudly ignorant people. way! Freedom responsibility!   paying attention? US donating vaccines 3rd world countries months now. 110 million 65 countries. ton given total population, countries.

You sound like want universal health care? fully support that.

But first point - private business decision, ""big gov daddy"" - I'm sure connecting dots. lot us happy it. recently called doctor's office find visit would insurance told could copay $15 specialist copay $25 $158 maybe $324 potentially $539 know coded. matter would specific thing, would come coding.

Incenditally, also pay $94/month insurance, $2500 deductible plus 10% pocket(over deductible amount), everything pay actually falls within deductible. Also, I'm considered pretty good insurance. one way solve free rider issue.. Brucella problem labs infectious, immediately obvious grow - UK, fairly rare, might lab couple days able identify - time whole lab needs prophylactic treatment.

*E.coli* \- particular produce shigella like toxin, problem low infectious dose - less 10 organisms would probably enough cause infection.

In three decades working clinical microlabs, think 3 occassions proven laboratory acquired infection. Theres nothing new regarding virus-No ""new"" variants outcompete delta, people get vaccinated mostly fine(just like vaccines supposed do). western country vaccinated theres nothing else do-better switch covid news. Why?  number factors affect ability control weight (both genetic, lifestyle) puts judging people weight far slippery slope setting insurance premiums based things people can't control

What things affect ability eat less calories?  I'm familiar allergy tests, vaccine reactions same. vaccine needs deliver payload cells let immune system react. case mRNA vaccines, deliver mRNA cells manufacture spike protein. immune system reacts that, causing symptoms. skin test cannot replicate that, think there's screen duplicate that. guage reaction, need cause immune system respond, administering vaccine. 

 besides, severe reactions vaccines incredibly rare, far less dangerous virus itself. fact view people refusing vaccination idiots. Vaccination one greatest advances human health, one shot prevents getting sick. easy prevent horror we're seeing southern US. thin 30% bodyfat, different BMI I'm teacher nurse, worked nonprofits 4 years. true scary. none immunizations impacted good chance one wont either. 1st covid vaccine impact mine. 2nd cycle noticed heavier flow...I usually little none anything noticeable. However recently additional unrelated vaccines impact. immune response. next month completely normal vaccines. However one know noticed difference cycle thought crazy :) . ...they are. Neither risk community current pandemic, keep swinging missing. 


Charging diabetes dumb unhealthy/obese become diabetic (Type 2). Omg. horrible. People really need SEE shit.  $50K / day - that’s right I’ve seen many conflicting reports vaccinations vs natural protection far Covid protection. article studies seem imply natural infection may create adaptable B-Cells evolve longer period time vs vaccines. Yet Mayo Clinic (which question intentions study, I’ll hold thoughts it) implied vaccinations give far better protection, natural protection fades relatively quickly.

And fact Covid reinfections still quite rare, breakthroughs, still pretty rare itself, appear common reinfections.

Yes breastmilk contains IgA antibodies. However stay baby’s gut provide passive immunity hours baby eventually digests antibodies eats again. never cross bloodstream baby never creates it’s antibodies it. protection breastfeeding lasts long baby breastfed. antibody testing checks IgG IgM antibodies via blood. Since baby doesn’t IgG/IgM antibodies breastfeeding antibodies receive (IgA) won’t cross bloodstream, blood test tell nothing baby testing for. would work baby known case baby vaccinated. vaccinated pregnant babies get maternal IgG antibodies doesn’t last long hence start vaccinating babies 2 months last year city sturgis voted rally. ignored city council. grasping anything help year. aren’t good. tradition thing.

What? would definitely possible progression variants stopped Alpha. Cases dropping exponentially Delta took off. happens turn critical medical care business. Texas shithole state apparently. Oh sure! wish hospitals part grand rounds like that, especially talk issues relating public discourse. It’ll potent weapon plethora misinformation running rampant nowadays! Nothing special contribute except say imagine stressful special needs kids. see appreciate keep kiddos safe. best. Well, named Greek letter indirectly. Delta named named Mississippi Delta region 1940s. 

Of course, river deltas known deltas Nile River Delta looked like.. letter Delta... end named Greek letter. Wow. guess I'll getting booster dose then..... sexual part big respected part, means required. Lots aroace folk fandom. Sorry that’s works. insurance companys need money *insert reasons here*. sure eye opening  mean hardly first time people caught getting hired Majors. think heard everything heard story new hire freezing asked kind engine King Air has. Holy fuck ads!!! 😱😱😱 No, much 'literally idea"" vaccine affects kids 16. There's approved EUA 12-16, multiple ongoing studies kids younger that. FDA asked larger sample size due slight risk myocarditis, otherwise safe effective, expected.

These pediatric studies several months data thousands participants. something gone horribly wrong would heard now.

Meanwhile delta ripping kids, hey let's keep pretending vaccine somehow total wildcard dangerous disease itself. goalpost moves fast, fucking blur! Yes, he's kinda vaccine guy really. 'coercian bullying' seeing insignificant decision getting vaccine be.

Vaccination poster child ""Miracles Science!"", invention saved innumerabe lives, go save millions things destroy families daily basis. father watched brother die disease youth saw eradicated - may get see eradication HIV, took dozens peers away height living New York. Losing friend HIV commonplace scratching another losing lottery ticket, he'd say.

For lived empathize true consequences eradicated diseases - choice get vaccine brainer. simply boring, massive self societal benefits. Imagine sitting circle people, everyone pushes button get $1,000,000. refuse hit button absurd, *that* draws emphatic response 'people like me'.

We right make educated decisions health, however also **responsibility** comes public health (e.g. vaccines).We cannot simply sit back participate. Thankfully, accepted right responsibility, exists mountains data. Whether EUA process, clinical trials, vaccine's ingrediants, short term side effects, potential long term effects (e.g. zero), etc.

I fault anyone skeptical careful health, every right trust dude internet pursue information yourself. also fault pissed condescending dude internet.

But end day - data, social responsobility, basics human sympathy empathy - vaccine objectively correct choice, refuse simply selfish. Hey get this, read news maybe common knowledge yet, apparently lot people getting sick dying covid vaccine side effects. even people think they're healthy need vaccine getting hospitalized too. Crazy world numbers big understand, know. Starting think Cuomo fella Dude OK?  Thanks passing along. problem cost differences obese / non-obese going accumulate ages people prime working years.

So insurance companies people whole lives, cost differences obese obese great. instead likely years periods difference obese / non-obese greatest (e.g. ages 20-55) Medicare covering period healthy-people-costs start incurred (ages 65+).

&amp;#x200B;

So might obese person:

Costs age 20-55: $400,000

Costs 56-74: $200,000

&amp;#x200B;

And thin person:

Costs age 20-55: $200,000

Costs 56-85: $400,000

&amp;#x200B;

So lifetime costs ($600,000) both, age 56+ costs healthier person higher live longer, costs period private insurance obese person much higher thin person ($400,000 vs $200,000) \*will\* get worse.  
We're addressing issue. lockdown, remote learning, hell even wanna pay us extra money. austerity get tf back work time. They'll kill kids grandma whoever keep economy going. enough locals felt strongly different time take action"
