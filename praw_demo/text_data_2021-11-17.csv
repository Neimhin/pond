0,2021-11-17," 34 got mine today. Soar arm whatever, gonna live.  One reasons, sure, you‚Äôd regress factors (and vaccines probably largest coefficient). 

However, air filters tons knock-in benefits anyway carry on! Shit! Job enforcement vaccination got thrown court? Fantastic (not).  true. joke.  Agreed. Covid still wreaking havoc World. quite yet, unfortunately.    Got booster last month. Currently struggling fight delta variant.     west cannot believe media portrays different. want china look good... I'm jealous herd immunity, no. move on.

Yeah, boosters also gotten. People commenting type post mentioning it‚Äôs always 2nd dose knocked feet.

How common phenomenon, didn‚Äôt experience symptoms second sore arm two days.  I‚Äôll start saying she‚Äôs educated (masters) medical field - like me. makes baffling. misinformation crazy!! She‚Äôs full government conspiracy train. Thinks vaccine terrible killed people government isn‚Äôt telling us. Thinks won‚Äôt able get pregnant cause birth defects. Tells watch dopesick open eyes big pharma they‚Äôre make money. It‚Äôs China‚Äôs fault, also somehow Fauci‚Äôs well thinks he‚Äôs devil gain function research.  ‚ÄúEnforcement‚Äù‚Ä¶ yeah that‚Äôs inaccurate. didn‚Äôt ask see ID. vaccine card verified wasn‚Äôt fake state database. office went WFH Thursday (the 12th 19th, unsure) things started getting bad insane lucky that. 

A us still going days, Friday coworker's partner came pick came office minutes. week later started displaying symptoms bad case, luckily survived well now. contracted days came office. done WFH thing would standard Friday happy hour \~100 people main area hanging drinking beer. 

Still can't believe close came massive outbreak. would say least lot better though. Per population percentage people infected per day US 0.00027 Australia 200 day would 0.000008% infected day. may look like that's massive difference. Zero may achievable still great numbers! Yeah, rest world lockdowns like would killing it.  Israel pulled recently, least zero deaths. Eastern Europe getting hit hardest, rich region (especially look outside big cities).

That said, lot countries region, problem much legacy communism, left populations extremely suspicious authority vulnerable anti vax rhetoric. one expects consistent. mean there's still morals two years this? üòù fact PA one 13 original colonies already eliminates mid-west state. mid-west largely consists states/colonies founded US expanded land, part sort frontier. 

Also I‚Äôm sure getting cultural argument. seem imply since PA industrial cities like Pittsburgh Erie culturally fits mid-west, yet mid west states like Nebraska Iowa don‚Äôt cities still considered mid-west. Also Trenton NJ another industrial city considered rust belt yet doubt would consider NJ mid-western state. 

I live Philadelphia, I‚Äôve many places across state. one considers PA midwestern state, US census doesn‚Äôt consider PA mid-western state, I‚Äôm pretty sure nearly everyone mid-west doesn‚Äôt consider PA mid-western state. PA claimed mid-west, people would either confused laugh you. 

Sorry long comment, PA mid-western state geographically culturally. I've actually found really hard find booster shot live red area. gotten weeks ago least I'm dumb dumb want March 2020 happen again.

***Again***?  appreciate integrity, also supposed first go around. time booster supply/demand issues.

One thing taught me, look family. Nobody else seems give damn, waiting around proper authorities give go ahead quite frustrating. Exercise that. Alberta, opened floodgates eligibility yet booster. Got second shot June 26. Leaving international trip (for 3 weeks) Im guessing close eligible return. 

Anyone know exacting booster? 6 months day 6-months...ish?    when? 90% Irish adults vaccinated. Everyone who's either want medically able get none go pubs. virus going away. going lock country every months rest time save couple dozen people's lives? spread family. doing? Yeah except necessary. New Zealand example locked hard heavy borders. kicked hard. able enjoy fairly normal life exception masks distancing. able enjoy many luxuries inside country normally would unlike US spread everywhere.

You pointed started China. Much harder contain something starts no? That's preventative measures fast acting would saved day... 

Yeah great freedom. Yet, freedom killed tons loved ones disabled many others. year half get vaccine would much ask grand scheme things. Everyone pretends way went saved economy... However, controlled could supporting business like restrauants much more. Instead shut down, bring back online, shut down, give subsides... Plus, people got sick cost tons money foreseeable future. 25 working government full time highly educated position. I'm disabled unable work government paying live. medicine costs minimum $100,000 year. rest life. many people like survived cost nation rest lives. That's minimum $6,000,000 me... hate it. Now, think people like me. 

We even worry imprisonment people made small sacrifices help others like wearing face mask... Many countries succeeded think like that. me. Booked appointment thinking I'll get third dose Moderna. pfizer, got that.
Mild fever sore arm. Yes, apparently big countries. studies found Pfizer effectiveness dropped 67% six months, whereas might drop low US. know, giving example different established religion following leader. Thought declared Europe epicenter Covid  Seriously, read comment J&amp;J participant got antibody tested five months shot S-antibody reading 9. comparison, Pfizer Moderna recipients usually readings 1,000, least hundreds, five months. 

It good idea concept, J&amp;J awful. 75% Irish vaccinated assume means virtually adults. herd immunity? 

Even end? never going away. still worried stay home let everyone else roll dice.

 I'm glad government bullshit anymore. vaccine everyone vulnerable chance get it. Time move on. also gives option hiding displeasure making mean faces customers annoy them. Winter. uptick occured around time last year. There's still many people never vaccinated caught virus yet hitting now. Judging pattern, it'll probably January February cases go down. Exactly! didn‚Äôt wait got booster anyway colossal fuckup. one knows they‚Äôre never waited long. Heading wrong direction.       Religion: Covid exist Holy Spirit keeps away (as know will) God's plan.

Science: Let's test vaccine novel virus lockdown environment assume work people allowed gather receiving it.

God: Facepalm Ontario that, cases low relative Quebec, - so, yes

Both provinces closing 90% eligible vaxxed, HEPA makes big difference   be, California declared everyone post 6 months eligible  I'm reading, young, healthy person could reach peak antibodies 7 days booster.  vaccinator knows they're doing. Although average anti vax type might know that.

tbh make much difference issue hand. Humans strong, primal aversion idea anything pricking injecting something body (whether bloodstream, muscle, skin). There's probably hundreds millions years evolution behind it, since things nature venomous animals parasites.

Cultural depictions injections also tend extremely negative.

It's probably easy exploit unconscious anxiety turn conscious fear. Conspiracy theories generally tend boil giving people explanation feel uneasy attacked.

I think might see big increase vaccine acceptance start using ones require needle. pill, patch nasal spray induce kind unconscious unease. Old people vote. shit Canada. Nightclubs industry remaining isn‚Äôt full capacity, even fully vaccinated. sports arenas filled capacity.

Even #covidisairborne folks good answer nightclub dangerous theatre COVID floats air like smoke. puritanical bullshit doesn‚Äôt impact Covid causes long term damage November 9th, believe need booster 6 months original vaccination, supposed give booster. turn away going CA Dept. Public Health. swear God deny minimize covid I'd slap develop first brain cell.   happened Nova Scotia tell since live Nova Scotia extremely well entire pandemic. edge case entire population province pissed .   Cool, lets use one country hugely culturally different west example. plenty examples COVID zero failing succeeding since DELTA. county full breakthrough cases. currently sitting vaccinated hospital ventilators unvaccinated. Upvoted back 0. unpopular, may right. It‚Äôs moving target. Sounds pretty selfish. Taiwan begs differ definitely Aaron f!@*‚Äú&amp;$ Rodgers. JFC cant take anymore NZ harsh lock 4 months still getting \~200 daily cases. Zero dead there.    ZERO COVIDis night impossible DELTA. Melbourne &amp; NZ tried months incredibly strict lock-downs avail. NZ still getting \~200 cases day months upon months lockdown. Zero COVID great pre DELTA world adopted would probably better position globally. worry guys, he'll flip-flop different number next time he's camera. what? agreeing fact currently lying data... proof that. hide excessive spread death two years, there's way. 

If talking rest said. Then, saying factor ten counting deaths would still far US total death. Even factor 100 still would reported 4,636 deaths far. US reported 766,000. definitely feasible off. However, likelihood developed country underreporting numbers much without noticed would quite hard believe. religion bans wearing mask getting tested?

This false dichotomy. it‚Äôs binary outcome herd immunity vs exponential growth. It‚Äôs logical fallacy OP made. One get endemic phase population highly protected, full protected herd immunity level. see cases, exponentially growing cases. Yup. Nightclubs changed opening hours already. making classic mistake here. Understanding matter slightest. Anti-vaxxers care facts. care people die. simply want told must something. hopeless cause. noted final decision likely decided Supreme Court, likely enforce it.  That's I'm saying both, vaccine patents got waived issue, vaccines produced like dozen two tops global entities there'll always unforced supply crunches Cooking kills viruses.

So measure success ""How done April 2020 November 2021"", yeah great. Unless covid later check antibodies - tests detect vaccines, past infection.

Three days make difference. Let's say third dose tapers double current immunity would really good, 50% instead 20-30%. would mean R0 reduces 6.5 5 lot.

Any chance stopping exponential growth delta vaccine herd immunity would mean requiring 90% vaccine immunity, might mean shot every two three months forever?  Ah. That‚Äôs good data point. 

To clear: I‚Äôve argued air filtration instead stupid plastic barriers year. You‚Äôre feeding assumptions further. Haha.  We're making 1.5 billion doses month. We're pace 20 billion total doses end year. *have* get first doses everyone willing take them. 

But supply issue, even though completely failed 2 billion doses monthly manufacturing ready year ago. We're *still* wasting doses giving second doses old people young people get first dose.  We're letting doses go bad thrown away. We're letting funding logistics hold us back - worldwide dose usage dropped 1/3 peak (per ourworldindata) even though manufacturing continues rise every month. 

There's easy answer. *all* need three doses. Ya, necessary us anyway might helpful covid. 

Definitely vaccines responsible fact infected employee spread anyone else. also zero cases pre vaccine era. environment pretty high risk. thing *perfect* compliance even everyone careful.

Or maybe got really lucky. We'll never really know. good employees. complete non issue.  looking like temporary solution.

According one group researchers, surprising answer may delta variant took care act ‚Äúself-extinction.‚Äù 
Three months delta variant spurred record daily nationwide caseloads nearly 26,000, new COVID-19 infections Japan plummeted, dropping 200 recent weeks. Highlighting drop fact deaths reported Nov. 7 ‚Äî first time happened 15 months. 
Many scholars point variety possibilities, include one highest vaccination rates among advanced countries 75.7% residents fully vaccinated Wednesday. potential factors social distancing mask-wearing measures deeply embedded Japanese society. 
But chief reason may related genetic changes coronavirus undergoes reproduction, pace around two mutations per month. According potentially revolutionary theory proposed Ituro Inoue, professor National Institute Genetics, delta variant Japan accumulated many mutations virus‚Äôs error-correcting, non-structural protein called nsp14. result, virus struggled repair errors time, ultimately leading ‚Äúself-destruction.‚Äù 
Studies shown people Asia defense enzyme called APOBEC3A attacks RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 virus causes COVID-19, compared people Europe Africa. 
So researchers National Institute Genetics Niigata University set discover APOBEC3A protein affects nsp14 protein whether inhibit activity coronavirus. team conducted analysis genetic diversity data alpha delta variants infected clinical specimens Japan June October. 
They visualized relationships among DNA sequences SARS-CoV-2 virus show genetic diversity diagram called haplotype network. general, bigger network is, positive cases represents 
The network alpha variant, main driver Japan‚Äôs fourth wave March June, five major groups many mutations branching out, confirming high level genetic diversity. researchers thought delta variant, U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention says twice contagious previous variants might cause severe illness unvaccinated people, would far vibrant genetic diversity. 
Surprisingly, found opposite true. haplotype network two major groups mutations seemed come sudden stop middle evolutionary development process. researchers went examine virus‚Äôs error-correcting enzyme nsp14, discovered vast majority nsp14 specimens Japan seemed undergone many genetic changes mutation sites called A394V. 
‚ÄúWe literally shocked see findings,‚Äù Inoue told Japan Times. ‚ÄúThe delta variant Japan highly transmissible keeping variants out. mutations piled up, believe eventually became faulty virus unable make copies itself. Considering cases haven‚Äôt increasing, think point mutations headed straight toward natural extinction.‚Äù 
Inoue‚Äôs theory, innovative, would lend support mysterious disappearance delta variant‚Äôs spread Japan. much rest world similarly high vaccination rates, including South Korea Western countries, suffering record waves new infections, Japan appears peculiar case COVID-19 cases remained subdued despite trains restaurants filling following end recent state emergency. 
‚ÄúIf virus alive well, cases sure would increase masking vaccination prevent breakthrough infections cases,‚Äù Inoue said. 
Indeed, unexpected plunge new cases following summer wave hot topic discussion among many experts, including conducting studies coronavirus, according Takeshi Urano, professor Shimane University‚Äôs Faculty Medicine involved research led Inoue.

‚ÄúNo genome data exists, it‚Äôs hypothesis, disappeared, never see light day again,‚Äù said. 
So chances could see similar natural extinction overseas COVID-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus? 
‚ÄúThe chances zero, seems optimistic we‚Äôre unable get hold evidence, though looked various data countries,‚Äù said.

Yes health services strained. restrictions decrease spread help health services less strained.

You could argue reduced people's opportunities outside low risk environment exercise increased health service strain.

At best emotional reaction.  can't see benefit spread slower leading fewer people getting sick, fewer people dying? Giving hospitals time prepare? Giving governments time mobilize distribute PPE? 

You can't see benefit pre-Thanksgiving spread lower, meaning Thanksgiving Christmas spreads would lower? 

You can't see benefit month's worth people getting vaccinated reducing spread much countries food distributed markets bazaars I‚Äôm sure ever realistic long.

Jeez. Found original study, numbers are.. 

AY.4 - symptoms = 370/484.  
AY.4.2 - symptoms = 66/99. 
P=0.04 

AY.4 - COVID symptoms = 224/484. 
AY.4.2 - COVID symptoms = 33/99. 
P=0.02 

Probably needs studies confirm, find significance. 
Earlier UKHSA found lesser hospitalization mortality rate AY.4, larger sample size. contradict results, still little odd. 
If less patients symptomatic, might actually contribute increased growth rate see AY.4.2. People able self-isolate realize they're sick. don‚Äôt qualifications all? That's kinda point. skilled necessary medical workers often paid much less already underpaid service workers.   seemed harsh enough, month quarantine enough. 

How get people showing pro-red bias here.

Only in-so-far people make timelines justify biases. I've success local hospitals pharmacies, etc. booked. Good luck. vaccine know protects something 100%. Additionally, almost every vaccine requires boosters. vaccine requires 2 shots get 95% protection death 3 shots get 95% protection infection give take seems pretty standard me. course 100% correct. need encourage people get boosters discourage them. insanity! own, specific case fine though get shot. last sentence:  intentionally stop emitting CO¬≤ actively passively willingly killing others.

Well, yes, that's true. pollute intentionally deliberately (e.g. rolling coal) much culpable others.

The people lock completely (i.e. basically us) extent contribute ongoing pandemic, get vaccinated going beyond actively (and completely unnecessarily) endangering others.

Just can't avoid stepping ants walking outside mean could well start shooting kittens fun. perfect able criticise people choose antisocial assholes. anti-vaxxers causing huge spike.   Take look full list qualifying conditions. long includes even things like mood disorder. That's thought too. they're thinking vaccines make virus disappear, dealing COVID naive uninformed manner.

The covid pandemic meets 2 nascent airborne respiratory hazard requirements needed require respirators risk jobs (grocery clerk, bus driver, etc).

Meeting 2 requirements means mandatory levels ppe, provoded employer, fitment check program.

But instead got ""wear old piece cloth face""

Wow. shockingly regressive.

What next? ""Hardhat-shmardhat, wear whatever hat laying around"" - OSHA, probably. told trust experts.

Fauci says get booster. 

My local pharmacy says no. 

Who's expert?   That‚Äôs relevant. earlier posters trying argue absolute statement two states: herd immunity/zero covid versus exponential growth. said bearing point; actually contradicts thank making mean endemic phase presents acceptable level risk avoid quarantining affronts 'normal life'.

Acceptable whom? Maybe personally want see absolute zero risk, fine that‚Äôs personal preference. many government many people, fully vaxxed (which could include booster dose point) represents reasonable safety level. highly vaccinated areas, it‚Äôs mostly pandemic unvaccinated. vaccinated population shares tiny fraction case load. 


I‚Äôm saying personally accept risk assessment, lots people feel way. personally want minimize risk, certainly can, wearing mask top getting France endemic phase Black Death 

Black Death covid. One disease another. different version ‚Äújust flu‚Äù logical fallacy spring 2020. Even CDC's [booster information gives ""examples workers may get booster shot"" - implying includes even work outside broad vague categories listed examples. vagueness lends 'oh gee misunderstood thought job fell categories.'

And, maybe article uses term ""jab"" hard time taking seriously that.  personally believe it‚Äôs big deal would help us get normal quicker stable manner, get it. I‚Äôd rather people board boosters anti-vaccine passport that‚Äôs trade off.

Like said original comment, frustration post yesterday brigaded whiny pseudo-anti-vaxxed think boosters worst thing world can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôll schedule day

Are quad shot latte drinker too? tell us stay inside 18 months? They're together picture drew. also stripped away lot hope majority people semblance decency. appears it‚Äôs minority majority everyone else die means lives inconvenient course still mask indoors public

Are particularly high spread area? like 8000th time, deaths wrong metric.

Hospitalizations big problem. could save every single COVID patient, nobody could dying, hospitals could still overrun COVID patients, standard care could drop across board. agree messaging awful boosters admitted necessary earlier. don‚Äôt see person went got booster feels taken ride government says made right call choice beneficial. Like, they‚Äôre agreeing did. made right call. 

Being taken ride would went got booster came boosters nothing actually got saline arm. wise thing ""80% vaccinated means masks"" deal. Several States done successfully without outbreaks rough approximation, none gotten it. even many polling indicated would (around 25%).

Well supply still issue lot places. think we'll see 25% number pretty soon steady drop vaccine rates age. Similar 12-17 year olds, got first 25% month took 3 months get second 25%. stop talking masking down. would trash something find sensible yourself? everyone followed MASKING social distancing guidelines day 1, dank pit now.

If everyone followed guidelines day 1 one would wear masks all...  know answer first question, would expect someone three doses Moderna going much antibodies someone J&amp;J Moderna booster. 

In specific case, think kind moot point, since hybrid immunity. really good shape compared people. thought that, work schedule makes hard. Plus work environment office care masks despite mandate. feel like matter time get want ready guess?  got mine Friday felt fine Monday! myocarditis vaccination really serious issue. Aside rarity, severe almost always fast recovery. 

myocarditis COVID, OTOH, far serious.

Does anyone seriously think myocarditis vaccines fatal causing long term damage? OR, *finally* come terms reality accept Covid stay forever, it‚Äôs past time move restrictions mandates Assuming ICU cases ineligible children, that's 13.5 fold higher risk ((6/10)/(4/90)) critical cases among unvaccinated.

That's pretty reasonable whole population, countries vaccination offers better 20 fold lower risk younger adults, benefit modest, maybe 5-7 fold, elderly also intrinsically likely require critical care infected. actually 3,000 sampling standpoint plenty.   people actively break laws/regulations

DeSantis *has* actively encouraging people break laws regulations. He's *encouraging* (see 8 year old suspended school wearing mask, held press conference), also *rewarding* behavior (see $5000 checks he's offering unvaxxed police officers defying mandate states come work Florida). probably wait 5-6 wks shot 2, instead minimum 3 wks.

Thats good plan. data pretty clear 3 weeks short already given away 250 million doses free, billion doses order giving away free, administration investing billions expanding manufacturing capacity today.

While agree allowing patents IP protection life saving medical developments immoral, situation, ""IP law"" line joke. None poor countries speak even capability manufacture vaccines, moot point. Legislation/job loss worse death, death doesnt convince people get vaccinated arent going get vaccinated. unlikely get vaccinated. narrative changed many times since start whole thing. Coronaviridae new thing progressivley gotten worse last 25 years. vaccines bandaid bigger problem involves elements problems found solutions.  booster every 6 months thing? gotta ‚Äúresearch‚Äù Facebook first  Wtf...I can't take shit anymore...   real issue many people expect right answers right away Fauci kind magical incarnation Google Search Nostradamus, course people really know much viruses work capable since pandemic history something taught well grade school. probably

The south mostly already went huge delta wave midwest northeast not. we're reversing - amateur guess cold weather playing part northern states, forcing people indoors. weather south mild comparison. lot folks ***felt*** we'd always need boosters

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, despite right ***feeling*** going happen, without actual data back up, would irresponsible CDC make claim they'd criticized making unfounded claim regardless, much like they're getting criticized ***not*** making unfounded claim back right now.

IIRC, actually said was, ""at time feel boosters necessary"", course Delta popped India, spread around world, changed game entirely. re-infection even thought possible enough evidence occurring significant enough levels raise concern. virus sets pace here, researchers scientists best can. state, also need comorbidities. want booster shot, thank you. can't get :| approve 5 safer already limited interactions kids get. Wait real talk, doctors measure ask smoke right? Like assume mean ""are SMOKER?"" Like pack day even week. modern times, Church Christ, Scientist denomination Christianity openly discouraged vaccines. Yet, suddenly people persuasions decided religion somehow forbids one vaccine want. 

Really objections rest antivaxxers, hide behind religious rationalization want seem selfish. Thank congrats! good people. image tourism. people always use example thalidomide. thalidomide babies born result mothers taking drug *wasn't* approved morning sickness. That's example FDA actually job, inspire confidence organization got Pfizer pflu time. flu arm felt worse afterward. ""super immunity."" fine.

There still studies done mixing matching protection, boosting farther better boosting sooner original dose. signs (yet) people ""serious complications"" went J&amp;J Moderna. article seems mish-mash different data writing seems conflate things together.

Any evidence waning immunity seriously disease seems confined elderly long term care facilities.

There's evidence boosters also additionally reduce hospitalizations 2-shots people over-40, claim see waning there, claim even better.

Then speculate it'd good younger people get boosted since probably protective concede difficult see numbers.

Hospitalizations unvaccinated people also course rising cases hospitalizations rising. There's mention categories people proportion.

I think there's anything false article, hot mess different claims mashed together. look Vermont's Covid data, something stands June 20th vaccination rate first dose started slow significantly (less 0.1% point getting first dose day)

And time, 73.3% states population least one dose. 

Fast forward five months later November 72.2% received second dose. 

So guessing contributing factor folks getting doses partially protected. 

It's interesting data lines increase cases, started around mid-July. 

The majority vaccines state administered (65% population) got first dose May 15, 6 months ago meaning vaccine waning efficacy majority vaccinated population. 

My assumption is, end June lifted restrictions vaccinated opened risk taking. vaccinated assumed mostly safe, unvaccinated care watched closely nervousness. 

Now folks still wearing masks public, think overall trend year seeing friends family, people started taking smaller calculated risks meeting indoors larger groups friends family. Causing spread. 

And contributing that, could Delta raged unvaccinated groups past months, circulating vaccinated community, unvaccinated cases beginning slow down, time vaccines wearing off, variant likely circulating vaccinated groups causing breakthroughs. 

Eg. Moderna's efficacy rated 89% effective March (against mostly Alpha variant) September rate dropped 58% effective. legal things disagree fundamentally different encouraging people actively break laws/regulations. doubt. several counties near 18+ vaccination rate ~39%

This link let track I‚Äôm sorry hear nephew. comment rude, apologize. Man, whole thing really highlighted education system failing even harder thought. That‚Äôs image says, mask requirement Yep, vaccines much better. title incredibly misleading taken down. Netherlands wait turn...so I'll boosted somewhere February. kindly put it, please go intercourse I'm boosted personally feel like I'm getting taken ride. shit see come covid really unsettling.

Because viruses change, evolve, adapt keep spreading replicating much possible, often times ways can't predict ahead time. fluid situation dynamics likely change several times pandemic through.

I'm saying party this, hate hear, ""Well said one week, B next!"" Yeah! That's shit goes dealing fluid situations many moving parts constantly changing data variables! think Nostradamus works CDC predict everything go years ahead time? No!

There's thousands scientists researching every single day trying get ahead it, fact is, viruses nature, virus always ahead curve researchers always trying keep it.  I‚Äôm day dreaming wondering constantly exposed virus best case long term immunity. 

For example, infected mild symptoms last December. full vaccinated April/May.  exposed virus since then, would reset immunity? Would exposed constantly require body maintain immunity?  Rushing market without data also potential bodies attached it.

Remember Fen-Phen? Two drugs administered correctly relatively beneficial, administered together caused heart valve issues? administering together done research backing up, never approved FDA, people suffered. may see numerous attempts lawsuits normal process; not. man *took away salaries* county school boards mandated masks. man threatened cruise lines COVID-19 protocols. man whose *only* goals economic political. regard anything benefit politically.

For example, service workers high risk exposure due high volume human interactions. contrast, someone works home would likely need it. said, free may future, worth getting mind.    Plenty sources there. one lied extremely disingenuous say so.

The messaging confined relatively small places masks would far useful hands people trying contain outbreak general public, point little worry about.

More importantly though, think telling every time crackpots want talk authorities ""lied"", literally always go back misunderstanding masks two entire years ago. Give already, know exactly think.  like idiot laminated mine since free Office Depot ""I Lrrr ruler planet Onicron Varient 8"" recommended people 18 up. 17 year old child got J&amp;J shot I‚Äôm counting days til reach 18 get booster. like flu shot places around world counting people *needing* booster shot certain number months past original second shot. getting first round, good go.

However, low death toll, also extremely low case count impressive comparison (talking like first 6-8 months especially, nobody really knew contain &amp; worked)     lying? think conspiracy say two shots kept secret revealed 3 shots? find interesting New Zealand point view. Jacindas major actually Bachelor Communication Studies think showed comms.

And credit comms well. Simple easy understand alert levels helped aliviate lot confusion early on.  [So study came claiming masks reduce COVID incidence 53 true, honest question: Germany all-time high cases virtually universal masking, apparently people wearing higher-quality F22P masks?  vaccine regimes kids involve sequence 2 4 shots course 1-2 years (sometimes 3-4 years). 

The flu vaccine every year - lot different flu viruses. 

So either yearly covid shot well, lasting immunity 3 possibly 4 shots. 

Now lot data, looks like would better space first two shots - like 2.4 3 months rather 3 weeks (Pfizer) 4 weeks (moderna). Boosters really started administered end summer, there's much way data yet another 6-8 months. 

Also, putting aside, we'd much along towards ending everyone eligible got initial shots booster. beginning outbreak did, don‚Äôt really see evidence maintained entire time. evidence this? It‚Äôs pretty hard hide control pandemic inside country two years.

And point welding doors. whole thing welding people inside apartments actually myth. actually happened buildings would weld exits instead people exiting several different entryways would go one exit help control spread better. whole thing welding people apartments fucking lie. 

I live Long covid every day life it‚Äôs totally fucked up. athlete two years ago barely get stairs. Kind fucking freedom this? Delta, might good enough, we're seeing immunity waning combination immunity naturally waning bit, short interval first two shots optimal, also Delta much nastier strain. worked working now.

The stats bear out. trials, population boosters 90% fewer hospitalizations, severe illnesses, deaths population two shots.

Add speculation help transmission potential develop long COVID seems clear smart thing get booster.

We get vaccines, anyway.

It's currently *not* clear we'll need boosters, since big driver current need Delta, another, worse variant show up, might enough.   right here. 

I think many people assuming booster last long first round, haven‚Äôt already reports boosters last LEAST 9 months afterwards (bc that‚Äôs long data them)? last time heard months months ago. even last year. people going ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good 2‚Äù comments make zero sense. refusing booster shots indignant? fit virus doesn‚Äôt give shit what‚Äôs convenient continued problem? 

Why opposed third shot you‚Äôve already gotten two therefore, hopefully, antivaxx moron (with obvious caveat health issues reaction problems prior vaccines.)

Also, again, LA County following Orange County's epi curve closely despite differing mask number geographical regions time spans choose, probably find place almost anything happening :)

I buy this. 50 % effect stopping transmission absolutely enormous would plainly visible epi curves places mask mandates widespread mask wearing versus places without mask mandates low mask wearing.

For record, I'm 2-dosed growing exhausted bureaucracy surrounding immunizations.  complicated, over-think it. question cardiologist.  vouch this, got pup pandemic. want around people never met humans. first 5 months life. barks every single person dog sees. tough.  live work area barely 40% vaccinated. diabetic coworker second job McDonald's found today antimasker/antivaxxer working COVID days tell anyone. Guy told McDonald's doctor given note go maskless duty. coworker freaking may exposed. kidneys 15% effectiveness he's pretty frail he's going raise hell tomorrow McDonald's. wears mask constantly partially vaccinated.  I've often seen PA counted one. midwest fairly contentious issue I've noticed, interesting discussion... Missouri frequently included midwest, including official US Census definition. But, similar US Census including Maryland Delaware south, think that's historically-true, presently-false assessment. Missouri part south. Pennsylvania, straddles Northeast/Midwest divide Philly half fair call northeast Pittsburgh half fair call Midwest, in-between quite fit either.

If want exclude PA list, that's fair concession. also include two Pacific-coast adjacent states AZ+NV intentionally. point feel it'd fair exclude well, leaving picture basically unchanged: 57m vs 54m, instead 69m-64m. Even 57m-64m, net conclusion changed: midwest empty lot people.

Note know mention disagreement conclusion focused PA part. noting clarity. precisely, article came Guardian mentions study BMJ link it.  reporters this?  people call Grauniad? matter much here.... look population size compared land mass. called density.

Taiwan's density is: 1,742 people per mi2

UK density is: 727 people per mi2

This huge difference favor Taiwan. Disease spread air borne particulate dependant upon proximity. closer together? Tawainese are. obvious US cities hit hardest first even though R (infectivity per person) value much lower covid beginning compared now.

The UK definitely could done Taiwan did. failed miserably. Leadership Boris Johnson could blame. Also, westerns alike entitlement whatever want. cultural difference us many Asian countries. look outcomes whole effect me.

Yes, United States well Taiwan could due WAY larger population. big difference start make difference. However, US could done significantly better failed. China way bigger populous US though managed way better. 

The pandemic taskforce removed Trump meant identify disease three months advance. Taiwan highly successful identified problem early implemented strategies effectively deal it. new Zealand. 

It would feasible US identified early cut boarders, stop travel, implement couple week hard quarantine whole country. national guard military could used deliver food time. could retained hard border lockdown entry. country could opened back inside. would inevitably better economy did. exactly New Zealand did. perfect way better.

If extrapolate death rate Taiwan new Zealand per population apply US population death total tiny compared currently have. Even multiple numbers value ten still fraction death saw... thing bx not, doesnt matter dont speak Dr. dip deaths didnt last long back 1500 per day Yeah, sucks them, but, customer, like it.

Colorado governor signed executive order adults qualified. booster scheduled Tuesday.    quit bitching we'll get thru unity. study says masks reduces incidence 53%, \*if\* wearing masks, would twice many cases right now. may true, regardless many cases right now, right? study say COVID, says half unmasked incidence.

US can‚Äôt handle covid, there‚Äôs WAY survive smallpox.   fact: CDC entire team health communication specialists apparently absolutely nothing.

This entirely purpose, CDC (and agencies like FDA) wish otherwise. 

I‚Äôve worked pretty extensively public health messaging issues (as researcher, marketing person). rules governing government agencies allowed say extensive draconian - western nations. Industry fight tooth nail every step way, too, they‚Äôre opposing public health campaign affects bottom line. 

As result, we‚Äôre left combination milquetoast advocacy short term campaigns expire take full effect. There‚Äôs also massive funding issues. 

What need WWII style information campaign whole government kind effort. It‚Äôs legal, funded, would vigorously opposed appropriately half elected representatives. 

Hell, one prominent political leaders cussed Big Bird trying make kids less afraid getting shot. Imagine good ad campaigns would half Coca-cola actively trying run company ground, getting promoted so.  Even fucking Mexico online database vaccine receipts QR code people companies check.  work clinic giving Covid vaccines. literally even bother asking anyone qualified boosters ""qualifications"" vague pointless ask. exactly problem relying people‚Äôs ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù rather science. People gave experience flu, diseases fade background vaccine developed. Even flu, people catch every 5 10 years, it‚Äôs yearly disease people. would use lot caution trying extrapolate know flu coronaviruses.  Theres really reason spread fear this. vaccinated protected be. Studies showing vaccinated unvaccinated spread Covid easily one another. choice put safety risk point little bearing own. 

This we're still seeing breakthrough infections high levels countries like Israel Singapore 80% vaccination rates. Vaxxmaxxing  Yes, except you‚Äôre allowed travel, work, eat restaurants without proving you‚Äôve flu vaccine. sure really opinion either way that, it‚Äôs wild times we‚Äôre living in.     that's cure... improves chance getting sick  absolutely science thing became ""corrupted"". message ""don't wear masks"". ""don't wear masks unless sick"". people (excluding healthcare workers etc needed protected line duty) wanted wear masks largely selfish; wanted protect themselves. Whereas public health perspective, limited masks, masks worn infected.

With SARS, people infectious developed symptoms. March 2020, reports pre-symptomatic Covid transmission lousy China anecdotes. What's worse high profile NEJM article Chinese conference attendee Germany spreading symptoms developed [torn discovered fell ill enough take acetominophen/paracetemol. thing pre-symptomatic transmission, general public need wear masks unless symptoms.

But then, 2 well- researched articles demonstrating multiple cases pre-symptomatic transmission accepted published CDC's journal March 27 April 1, April 2 3, CDC made U-turn recommend universal masking, including cloth/homemade masks protect others wearer, rather way around. 

It absolutely science-based decision. messaging failed convince public. people hard time separating concepts wearing mask protect vs protecting others. You‚Äôre still fully vaccinated 1&amp;2 J&amp;J. wish one vaccine the/a card, you‚Äôre special case far know? got mine 05/05 state live (CA), rite aid, cvs, Walgreens saying I'm eligible. I'm 18-49 underlying conditions occupational risk. ideas what's going on?   many people baffled this? simple. Google it.  found late. Rejected boarding plane. ü§üü§ü  Exactly doctor said.

Yes. 6 months second one. It‚Äôs messaging - we‚Äôre watching pandemic real time. Findings change. Yeah, could also make case PA southern state touches Maryland. could say Florida western state touches Alabama‚Ä¶ touches Mississippi‚Ä¶ touches Louisiana‚Ä¶ touches Texas‚Ä¶ touches New Mexico‚Ä¶ touches Arizona‚Ä¶ touches California. 

See silly gets? PA midwestern state, part frontier midwestern states found, geographically fit bill. cities PA apart rust belt, isn‚Äôt unique Midwest. masks reduce transmission COVID. people use them, less transmission. 

Whether right tradeoff risk convenience different matter ... fucking sick 2 doses want third. least third Moderna.  mean, really bad able *plan* feel ill?

Since pandemic started, basically times I've ""sick"" vaccinated. covid used get sick enough miss work several times / year, course would always surprise happened. Colorado Sure. definition changing communicated expectations - aka moving goal posts ‚Äúcompliant.‚Äù

There vaccine protects well spread, especially SinoVac. That's also Singapore introduced lockdowns despite 90% vaccination rate.

Vastly different vaccination rates realities focus on. 

It's good policy copy another country blindly without research.  never said someone better, others make something save face politics Israel US same.

Different demographics. Different levels vaccination rate. Whole bunch different factors consider. better collect data people use models info countries.

The booster going help, acting like people ""defenseless"" wanted long recommend something.

If fully vaccinated still well protected, there's big difference like, 70% efficacy 90% efficacy, right? mean fucked without booster. higher chance getting infected, still going better time someone vaccinated alll.

Inhaled hydrogen (‚Äúactive form hydrogen‚Äù (APV; (H (H 2 O) )) powerful antioxidant anti-apoptotic properties used number experimental clinical studies recent years. 
 
Purpose . study safety effectiveness inhalation (APV; (H (H 2 O) )) rehabilitation program patients infection caused SARS-CoV-2 virus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2) recovery period. 
 
Material methods. randomized controlled parallel prospective study included 60 patients underwent COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019), post-covid syndrome (ICD-10: U09.9) recovery period, clinical manifestations chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) received standard therapy according protocol management patients chronic fatigue syndrome (ICD-10: G93.3): physiotherapy ancillary drug therapy drugs containing magnesium, B vitamins L-carnitine. study participants divided 2 groups: group 1 (main, n = 30) received daily inhalation APV; (H (H 2 O) m) 90 minutes 10 days. (apparatus ""SUISONIA"" Japan), group 2 (control, n = 30) received standard therapy. Patients groups comparable gender average age: main group - 53 (22; 70) years old, control group - 51 (25; 70) years. patients 1st 10th days. Observations determined biological markers systemic inflammation, oxygen transport, lactate metabolism, intrapulmonary shunting, 6-minute exercise test, vascular endothelial function. 
 
Results. main group, decrease indicators revealed: stiffness index (SI) 8.8 ¬± 1.8 6.8 ¬± 1.5 / (p &lt;0.0001), activity alanine aminotransferase 24.0 ¬± 12.7 20.22 ¬± 10.61 U / L (p &lt;0.001), venous blood lactate level 2.5 ¬± 0.8 1.5 ¬± 1.0 mmol / L (p &lt;0.001), capillary blood lactate level 2.9 ¬± 0.8 2.0 ¬± 0.8 mmol / l (p &lt;0.0001), calculated index intrapulmonary blood shunt (Qs / Qt, according Berggren method, 1942) 8.98 ¬± 5 , 7 5.34 ¬± 3.2 (p &lt;0.01), number leukocytes 6.64 ¬± 1.57 5.92 ¬± 1.32 10x9 U / L increase following parameters: reflection index (RI) 46.67 ¬± 13.26 63,32 ¬± 13,44% (p &lt;0.0001), minimum blood oxygen saturation (SpO 2) exercise 92.25 ¬± 2.9 94.25 ¬± 1.56% (p &lt;0.05), direct bilirubin 2.99 ¬± 1.41 3.39 ¬± 1.34 Œºmol / L , (p &lt;0.01), partial tension venous blood oxygen (PcO 2 ) 26.9 ¬± 5.0 34.8 ¬± 5.6 mm Hg. (p &lt;0.0001), venous blood oxygen saturation (SvO 2 ) 020.6 ¬± 51.8 018.1 ¬± 61.1% (p &lt;0.05), partial capillary blood oxygen tension (PsO 2 ) 48.7 ¬± 15.4 63.8 ¬± 21.2 mm Hg (p &lt;0.01), capillary blood saturation (SsO 2 ) 82.2 ¬± 4.2 86.2 ¬± 4.8% (p &lt;0.01), distance covered 6 minutes 429 ¬± 45 0 569 ¬± 60 m. 
 
Conclusion. Inhalation therapy AFV; (H (H 2 O) ) rehabilitation program patients underwent COVID-19, recovery period, turned safe highly effective treatment method. Positive dynamics noted form decrease manifestations latent hypoxemia, increase exercise tolerance, decrease endothelial dysfunction. laboratory tests, decrease number leukocytes, normalization lactate metabolism, decrease fraction intrapulmonary blood shunting right left.

I expect numbers go dramatically slots become available  scheduled kids get got call couldn‚Äôt re-schedule anywhere week :/   I‚Äôm glad kids able vaccinated holidays takes bribes? FDA OSHA?  remember, Alpha Federation Cardassians live, Romulan Klingon territory (though they're Beta Quadrant).

Delta known Borg. That‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt say shouldn‚Äôt getting vaccines Global South, went get booster (immunocompromised), one hospital network equipped give Pfizer regular basis- hard see could easily distributed places terrible infrastructure, even though Pfizer donating doses infrastructure needs.

A better solution public pressure companies got public funding develop vaccine give, patent waivers, access tech knowledge needed produce distribute countries need. need even C19 becomes endemic.

All i‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs complicated first world people giving boosters.

But selfish i‚Äôd life seeing large groups friends live performance back someday.   started exercising outside first time (consistently) quarantine, changed life better. strongly believe made beginning pandemic.

To clear: always exercised regularly, equipment home continued so, moved running outside. think getting outside home huge gamechanger. Sry, meant, hospitalised cases 50+. 

&amp;#x200B;

To last sentence: 

People intentionally stop emitting CO¬≤ actively passively willingly killing others.  system place innovating 


Weird way innovation encouraged old German patent system. current system stifles innovation. holds true experience. got two first dose last Saturday. think local kids done.   still early demand. five year old got shot three days ago, trying schedule since day 1. one checking anything ... go get 

It‚Äôs like February, supply limitless demand low. You‚Äôre taking someone else‚Äôs spot.  certainly could people demanding 18 months now.  Alright country going approve booster everyone then? I‚Äôve sitting hands waiting get  COVAXIN 

The vaccine developed using¬†Whole-Virion Inactivated Vero Cell¬†derived platform technology. Inactivated vaccines replicate therefore unlikely revert cause pathological effects. contain dead virus, incapable infecting people still able instruct immune system mount defensive reaction infection.

Also better defense emerging variants according data. United States provide vaccine equity giving everyone equal choice want pandemic   good idea get it.

One thing helped side effects knowing that, despite feeling little icky hours, actually sick, mental burden bear. rested bit.

The efficacy booster shots significant. Trials showed reducing hospitalizations/severe cases/deaths huge margin *over control group people already two doses*.

CDC, high schooler playing hard get. wanted everyone get booster made guideline. know result internal strife external politicking what, wishy washy dissembling inexcusable. hope masking planes never ends

Pre-pandemic, found every plane ride roll dice. I'd get sick half time.

I'll wearing masks planes on. Good read! Good God. conspiracy delusions illness themselves. even realize made friend sick?  get people arguing they're conveniently ignoring pile million dead Americans. see cases occur within older people.

This simply true. deaths hospitalizations old people, cases not. last huge wave Spain e.g. completely driven unvaccinated young people (who largely chance yet get vaccinated) spread (mostly vaccinated) older generations.

The deaths hospitalizations mostly (but exclusively) older people, reason got infected almost entirely due insane spread among unvaccinated younger people. cases really low, absolutely clear timeline unvaccinated cause peak, ended affecting vaccinated older population (since protection perfect know).

People intentionally get vaccinated willingly killing others.  Exactly. I'm vaxxed, probably going get booster soon, family vaxxed (actually, every person spend time IRL is) I'm going hold celebrations. high costs estimates PHRMA industry groups like Tuftss use quite sly tricks get people believing highly inflated development costs justify backend costs leading incredible revenues.

High cost development estimates many times untestable data, ignores enormous tax subsidies reduce costs inflates results imaginary expenses, profits could earned drug companies invested research dollars elsewhere.


Not even damn source line you‚Äôre saying.  That's hope I'm hearing now.

Apparently, we're dealing two problems. First short interval first two doses probably suboptimal time test for. Second Delta arose started ravaging world, infectious.

The good thing similar problems necessarily arise next half year. It‚Äôs bit shit excuse spend marketing stock buybacks. Yeah, bother slowing 99% completely fix everything stop completely? much better even bother trying. got second shot feel thing. whole drive home, kept thinking myself, ""they must screwed up, stood said something.""

What‚Äôs wrong authoritarian rules around it. Polar bears penguins live opposite hemispheres; never find together.  Again, job. I‚Äôve already done lol  Ok I'm boosted personally feel like I'm getting taken ride. shit see come covid really unsettling. 
When shut parks pandemic. Blah blah blah, go develop something give away free, we'll talk. reason remove mandate stupid people programmed faux News. talk country majority anti vaxxer. logistical issue Lol. Bud you‚Äôre parroting lobbying group lines. It‚Äôs funny see people superficial knowledge something pretend knowledgable on. 

Hell, you‚Äôd even read wiki link you‚Äôd see numerous studies calling PHRMA groups claims bs. 8 year old got yesterday Publix husband got boosters. Holiday surge Christmas getting us!  Honestly, talking doctor, appointment scheduled Sunday booster. even lbs overweight former smoker, technically qualify CDC guidance.

It could potentially come early today tho FDA, tomorrow CDC  yeah, statement Fauci scared me. work uni could get booster. 20 yo son kidney disease got his. leaves wife teenage daughter. told wife try using job (public library) justification able schedule one week. Thankfully boosters approved every adult, soon starts I'm going get well. 

Until boosted, mask public thanksgiving likely lot like last Christmas, unfortunately.  places taking anyone. Make appointment Walgreens something. probably take you. wasn‚Äôt technically quite due booster got one easily anyway. much living covid vaccines 7 day average 88,000.

The lowest ever got 11,000 last summer. Keep wearing masks everyone... 

This yet, things LOT better last year.

Covid annoyance 2022. Vaccines masks? sure anyone needs hear trouble finding one, apparently Meijer too. sure national mom told said lot people know. Hope message gets someone needs it! problem dealing it. lockdowns, vaccine mandates, curfews...etc. nothing like flu shot. Flu shots mandatory lockdown world flu season. Countries need wake fuck realize covid endemic non sense making worse feeding conspiracy theorist. offer shot, promote benefits, done it. AZ, various school districts partnering Safeway/Albertsons get vaccine schools. convenient  Go CVS online make appointment, click box eligible, get shot. check shit except date last shot. Got booster couple days approved even though eligible saw open appointments daily.  keeping anyone need KNOW need booster 6 months thanks countries. also know booster works damn near everyone... vaccine know care work grocery store office yourself. effect body same. works one type employment, works all. wait bureaucrat give ok protect health. Get shot. Fellow Nutmegger here. don‚Äôt qualify current CDC guidelines got booster anyway. person administering asked questions said happy see people getting it. Go get boosted! got moderna booster almost 2 weeks ago. Texas that‚Äôs got it. Daughter brought home school infected whole house. fully vaccinated well.  Ned Lamont encouraged adults 18+ get boosted. Americans qualify based set criteria anyway‚Ä¶ go get one. Morons never learn. I'm myself. Got soon eligible April. different world kids - scary. 5 7 year old shot, hesitancy. probably fine, also brand new idea long term effects might be. 

Thalidomide probably never happen exact manner - great example things slip us effects might known right away. Keep mind still drug use considered safe right application. took years discover limitations safe use however. Yeah don‚Äôt know comes from. US 70% adults fully vaccinated 80% least one dose.   one checks jack. think guy rite aid going grill job? correct answer.  Yeah, I'd still take 2 weeks covid, though. so, largely agree it. science communication throughout pandemic bad way explained solely scientific understanding evolving almost certainly real effects peoples behavior. Cool, go ahead develop covid drug free hand over. Actions speak larger words.  That‚Äôs marketing ploy. didn‚Äôt actually thing said would do. Lol Yes. four us able get boosters. kids 5 months shots school life wanted make sure covered. issues afterwards. Maybe slightly sore arm. Yes, said, premature assume. fact COVID infection plus vaccine create stronger immunity implies nothing innate SARS-CoV-2 precludes sustained immunity immunocompetent individuals. 

We developed, trialed, began mass rollout vaccines less year. knew two things them: safe, least trial window, highly effective. 

While everyone optimistic (myself included) two-dose vaccines would durable, think anyone *surprised* not. mean cannot made durable improved dosing schedule (which, unsurprisingly, priority testing given incredibly compressed timeline development). 

Regardless, permanent 6 month booster schedule. effective dosing schedule figured (e.g., first dose, second dose two months later, third dose eight months later, etc) potentially followed annual boosters worst case scenario. 

We two doses super rapid succession despite people believing optimal. people trialing vaccines dumb, trying save hundreds thousands (to millions) lives developing testing vaccines quickly possible. achieved that. excerpt:

Now, NIH-funded team discovered least part Delta‚Äôs secret, it‚Äôs attributable widely studied mutations spike protein links human cells ACE2 receptor. turns specific mutation found within N protein coding region Delta genome also enables virus pack RNA code infected host cell. result, increased production fully functional new viral particles, go infect someone else. wonder 225 million vaccine doses U.S. delivered countries helping put dent that. not, 1.1 billion we've promised help, along provided wealthy nations world. am, Austria looks like success story. Higher vaccination rates, ffp2 everywhere, stricter rules enforcement.

People Croatia best pretend pandemic all. Lol. past job mine. actually thing read Bloomberg article actual knowledge of.  Maybe ought go develop drugs treatments decades spending billions distribute hard work free. common sense understand arduous expensive process drug development, manufacturing distribution.. course ignorantly point marketing buybacks reason justify ignorance. Pretty sure even current guidelines include vague things like ‚Äúare increased risk due exposure‚Äù stuff like that, would zero percent let stop me. nobody gonna coming around trying punish people this, anyway. need criminalize non-compliance, catering selfish, ignorant assholes give shit anyone cost lives MILLIONS pandemic. Croatia 7300 today 4 million population.

Seems like whole part Europe fucked. Yes, slow vaccinating kids no-one wears masks, including kids school. there's little point 'a little bit vaccinated'. two shot regime working anymore. Germany ICU beds left. One thing people still scared myocarditis issue. still don‚Äôt actually know common age group.

The theory worse see older kids probably better due lower dose actual data yet. trial simply wasn‚Äôt big enough detect trying. late bay area, CA! literally third line mine first day available. would first someone needed bathroom turned paperwork. logical discourse works. making absolute statement states herd immunity/zero covid exponential growth. given counter examples. Coming back examples Singapore Denmark doesn‚Äôt argument. want argue absolute statement, burden proof disprove counter nations slightly slower growth rest higher degree natural immunity

Sweden ‚Äúslightly slower‚Äù growth rate. simply didn‚Äòt exponential growth throughout delta. far know, natural immunity roughly equivalent partial vaccination. You‚Äòre making point implying natural immunity could another factor.

this basically contradicts said earlier. argument made gone ‚Äúthere cannot possibly state herd immunity/exponential growth‚Äù ‚Äúwe could eventually get endemic non-vaccination means‚Äù. notice logical fail here? latter basically argues former. It‚Äôs called moving likely also end exponential well.

now that‚Äôs speculation without evidence. happens science fact/data driven? brilliant. [Soon; possibly Food Drug Administration aiming authorize booster doses Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine adults early Thursday, move would expand number Americans eligible additional shots tens millions, according people familiar agency‚Äôs plans. way nowadays. exact thing got vaccine. Yeah apt comparison would 12-15 group. took 11 days get 10% age range. Meanwhile.... rest world üî• seemed harsh enough, month quarantine enough. Also wet markets STILL even supposedly banned 2003 SARS outbreak. people showing pro-red bias here.  Lots online news sources picked study, here's kids die it. 

Verbatim reasoning I've heard several times. thought city would lie get it? call local health clinic they'll likely set up. article state allowing boosters got mine almost two weeks ago. idea 'approved' everybody yet got mine, call local health clinic, tell wanted booster, asked one wanted get shot couple days later. glad boosted. Abstract 
Objective review evidence effectiveness public health measures reducing incidence covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, covid-19 mortality. 
 
Design Systematic review meta-analysis. 
 
Data sources Medline, Embase, CINAHL, Biosis, Joanna Briggs, Global Health, World Health Organization COVID-19 database (preprints). 
 
Eligibility criteria study selection Observational interventional studies assessed effectiveness public health measures reducing incidence covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 transmission, covid-19 mortality. 
 
Main outcome measures main outcome measure incidence covid-19. Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 transmission covid-19 mortality. 
 
Data synthesis DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis performed investigate effect mask wearing, handwashing, physical distancing measures incidence covid-19. Pooled effect estimates corresponding 95% confidence intervals computed, heterogeneity among studies assessed using Cochran‚Äôs Q test I2 metrics, two tailed P values. 
 
Results 72 studies met inclusion criteria, 35 evaluated individual public health measures 37 assessed multiple public health measures ‚Äúpackage interventions.‚Äù Eight 35 studies included meta-analysis, indicated reduction incidence covid-19 associated handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 1.12, I2=12%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 0.75, I2=84%), physical distancing (0.75, 0.59 0.95, I2=87%). Owing heterogeneity studies, meta-analysis possible outcomes quarantine isolation, universal lockdowns, closures borders, schools, workplaces. effects interventions synthesised descriptively. 
 
Conclusions systematic review meta-analysis suggests several personal protective social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, physical distancing associated reductions incidence covid-19. Public health efforts implement public health measures consider community health sociocultural needs, future research needed better understand effectiveness public health measures context covid-19 vaccination.

Endless suffering. could boosted months ago Moderna said would offer royalty-free licensing low-income countries.

I'm way excited this.  Minnesota trouble. It‚Äôs extremely mild fall first taste winter rolled last week. Indoor gatherings going increase, especially NBA/NHL/NCAA games starting full capacity. 

And we‚Äôre 61% full vaccination   know article WI department health actual numbers? figures used article ""age adjusted"" statistics mention methodology raw data. Illinois break deaths around 30% - 40% past couple weeks. state figures directly calculate yourself. link number cumulative break change week week divided total deaths week numbers past 3 weeks 31%, 44%, 35% break deaths. Got booster 45 hours ago. Zero side effects took day case. hesitant cuz shot #2 really fucked 3 days I've things do. Anyways, point shots knock anymore I'm fine boosters. biggest concern. I‚Äôm honestly depressed, mild anxiety   Nobody gonna listen either way point would overwhelmed easily outbreak. I‚Äôm sure send extra patients.  ‚Äúslightly slower‚Äù growth rate. simply didn‚Äòt exponential growth throughout delta.

Sweden exponential growth May - Nov 2020 either covid highly seasonal Sweden.

Last winter Sweden followed growth rest europe 6 weeks delayed. government expects high spread winter introduced vaccine passes first time harshest restriction ever far know, natural immunity roughly equivalent partial vaccination.

Natural immunity delta around 5-6x effective infection compared full No, downvoted masking foolish, advocating terrible advice. deaths also right I‚Äôm reading correctly states deaths decreased despite increase cases. worst state Kentucky increased deaths 0.4 per 100k

We move away raw case numbers get people vaccinated since breakthrough infections rare mild happen. people worried myocarditis irrational uninformed. 

Perhaps, major news reporting done favors here. people go beyond headlines. zero headlines relevant source news people saying *not* big concern. Meanwhile, news came everywhere.  Go drug store get booster wish cashier supermarket delivery guy good day/good evening/good night, hold doors someone leaving place behind elevator? 

It's right thing do. Seems though forgetting 12-17 yo really seeing uptick hospitalization among people vaccinated two doses? 

If are, really slight. got booster, domestic data reflect he's saying. scientific consensus. - I'd advise anyone planning get boosted take following day arrange light day. Every conceivable muscle ached... first jab bad, second one felt like heartburn couple weeks dizziness. feel mostly back normal 3 months later. Booster time! wear seatbelt car airbags?  least study two suggests plexiglass bowls might actually WORSE cases. 

But boy make people feel good. They‚Äôre SOMETHING!  think makes future possibly look less concerning experience treatment improvements, like Covid pills supposedly way eight? BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca/Covishield, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Covaxin, and? find well encounter someone wearing mask ignore it. Escalation situation makes mental health suffer. They're purpose getting mad strokes ego makes more. like ignoring narcissist work, eventually fade away. 300 beds 34,000 people (if that's typo) enormous ? Virtually countries beds nearly 1% population.... seems delta variant really resistant vaccines.

No, not. delta variant far transmissible. way resistant vaccines, people vaccinated dying.

I hate article titles leave critical information, try give clicks. know they're though. news Delta-specific vaccines? would useful right we're giving boosters. taking dose anyone. works Because...to quite honest...the side effects covid vaccines pretty intense. really uncommon someone knocked 24 hours. 1) people like sick 2) lot people cannot take time work.

Everyone eligible next week  local pharmacy certainly incorrect. shocked pikachu faces students forced quarantine

Of course much, much worse shocking things needing quarantine... :/ How'd get it? Yes, lot folks felt we'd always need boosters, even year ago, obvious would need entire population. conservatism certain elements scientific regulatory community regard low risk intervention troubling. 

They want see data. problem is, data bodies attached it. know, great deal certainty diseases vaccines, right course action is, paralyzed.

Fauci knew needed quite time. CDC really failed here, ACIP particular. Yep. hospital NH already sending emails they're 150% capacity urging patients use urgent care possible instead think good exaggerate.  50/50 split vaccinated unvaccinated people ICU. keep mind 50% ICU population vaccinated represent 90% total population, 50% unvaccinated represent 10%. point youll hit threshold majority people covid vaccinated, vaccines work there's lot unvaccinated people pick refering presentation?

Doesn‚Äôt change prudence it. virus epidemiological situation changes, definition fully vaccinated time.

In perfect world we‚Äôd need vaccines, one shot, two. virus doesn‚Äôt care convenient fun us do. waning immunity high viral load delta, boosters clearly needed. Yet post yesterday people acting like boosters antichrist bitched moaned enough, relevant data evidence could ignored. can‚Äôt. Even protection severe disease falls old people quire significantly 7+ months hope vaccine passports go away soon 

Why? Canada they‚Äôve worked great. feel better bars restaurants things knowing everyone vaccinated, it‚Äôs encouraged anti-vaxx holdouts get shots.  Shops complaining lost revenue. behaviour dont really invite enter shops got Moderna booster last week - problemo. first two March, met 6 month qualification, look list conditions 65 (I 38), covers huge segment population. 

I say, though, finding Moderna booster challenge - places offer it.  Demand dropped way still making doses plenty now.  got J&amp;J shot also got booster shot protected much someone say 2 doses Moderna also booster? got J&amp;J shot April got Moderna booster 2 weeks ago. Also COVID July. Seems weaker J&amp;J booster 7 months later would make vulnerable serious complications someone 3 shots. thinking like cross contamination issues like people get salmonella chicken juices. cheaper gym membership

Google local vaccine clinics might find something. wonder pandemic levels Thanksgiving, travel cases. Take care stay safe everyone! freedom though. still get it, spread it, still require booster 6-12 months rate we've going.

FWIW, I'm Republican vaccinated, real situation. makes sense. want wear masks rest life however. smoked cigarette once! I‚Äôm former smoker!

Statistically, dying though. Among states reporting, children 0.00%-0.25% COVID-19 deaths, 6 states reported zero child deaths qualify even 1 lb overweight lol. 

That's like 80% adults right bat. 

Are depressed? Anxious? qualify too. 

But regardless they're open everyone like today so... Gotta wonder many flights going places surging

(You might consider putting ""/s"" first comment) Oh hmphhh got waste prevention shot got mine ask check qualify (smoking one them). 

My mom actually told check box realizing waste prevention actually option... fact ask tells using data *somewhere*.... actually answers know what's going happen. That's we've seeing constantly moving goalposts, statements redactions, slightly altered headlines. Unfortunately, quite relatives even gotten first 2 shots; extremely vulnerable health wise complication

Sorry point people saying it'll likey 3 shot regimen get best possibly longest lasting protection... people willinglyl walking around 0 shots really ay sympathy what's gonna happen them. There's person near signs yard whole bunch q-nonsense. one favorites ""Vax = 100% death rate guaranteed!!!"" I'm thinking... exactly? also introduced new / tighter restrictions unvaccinated today. know true is, I've always heard anything 200 cigarettes life makes official smoker (or ex-smoker vs. never smoked quit). Better late never see  Link Science paper discussed article:
[First Known COVID Case Vendor Wuhan  Q3 earnings report, Pfizer saying 2nd half 2022 6m-2y. Insane, know. hope they're wrong. Wife fully vaccinated, still reservations kids. may wait another year. accept dealing issues something happened due vaccine, know could handle something happened kids due reaction. Statistics prove children rarely negatively affected COVID compared senior population. ny, 48 hours Yeah, selected ""exposure risk work environment."" I'm still working home, wife works school little-to-no mask enforcement live city w/ 50% vaccination rate, feel like I'm cheating system anything. constantly moving goal post. First pandemic, pandemic unvaccinated, pandemic unboostered, point take medicine give us go back form life Every day violently spasm infertile body world, beeping tracking nanomachines drives mad. comfort comes magentized blood attracts swarms spoons bludgeon comatose state unlike sleep. Glad going well you. Speaking going well, gofundme.... doctor said ‚Äúwell know responded‚Äù  Same... happy easy was.  see go restaurants, see friends, etc... sell Yep. Even 50/50.... unvaccinated patients represent smaller % population. looked list literally meet qualifications. want follow official guidelines experts I'm jagoff ""did research"". experts currently telling wait, guess get booster yet. 

Am I... wrong that? ""doing research"" person lie say meet qualification understand it? posted NY Times article paper nurse, first month vaccine clinic bliss. Everyone high fiving cheering, tears joy, fun music, etc. Every day like party. people bitching they're forced get vaccinated work stupid happy booster patients scattered in. Totally different vibe. paper  Plague actually airborne (fun) still doesn‚Äôt spread understand germs thing.  

Scientists actually really close pan-corona virus vaccine MERS like virus won‚Äôt threat near future. also found Ebola isn‚Äôt deadly properly treated supportive care newly developed drugs. so? Yep go get it. may help tremendously areas see worse spikes Xmas/after. 

Guess we'll see. mean mandating lot agencies recommending it, lot people still want take it. personally own, issue guy comes tv new narrative new excuse every week numbers are, people fence sounds like bureaucratic bullshit made manipulate people taking shot, instead changing narrative every 5 mins, allow research play out, give update certain period time, I'm argue people's personal preference making observation.  Thank you. pharmacist said reactions first 2, booster, got every side effect listed. is. might bit cloying US audiences, perfectly normal word 'getting shot.' hurts little, population older +12 86% lack eligible people. mean, [the data clear, uptick last 2-3 

Compared unvaccinated numbers, small. 

Compared previous amount hospitalizations per vaccinated population though, it‚Äôs significant. 

Nothing said untrue even close lie.  mum 2nd shot worst, 3rd one mild. Seems coinflip. concern reactions severity lasts longer 3 days call doc. take care. true end pandemic, approved. Get sick, go doctor, test positive COVID, take pill, go home rest. inconvenient temporary flu, meaningful threat hospitalization death.

Vaccines would gotten us sooner, unvaccinated staunch ever, propel disease endemicity, extent already. don‚Äôt ask *which* condition qualifies you. Getting covid immunity like fucking virginity Covid last year that's different; really know boosters helpful not. there's known increased risk getting vaccinated infected (in trials measurable difference outcomes).   Washington Post noted July details provided W.H.O. Dec. 8 case seemed fit better entry online database viral samples linked someone got sick Dec. 16. response, W.H.O. said looking discrepancy. Well, covid news cycle lasted pretty damn long time lol

Been top headline every major paper nearly last 2 years lol  3rd Moderna worst too‚Ä¶chills low grade fever abt 18 hrs. went away, you‚Äôll fine.  Meh, time would clinically useful pandemic over, yet unvaccinated yahoos running may eat words I'm ineligible booster :( one I'm familiar believe associates. point simply education lot healthcare workers somehow white collar professionals example. 
So holding higher standard fools gold IMHO. wont bubonic plague know treat it. think airborn ebola kind really bad MERS strain. Bioterrorism thing too. see covid, take nearly year get vaccine even youre ‚ÄúWarp(ing) Speed‚Äù. COVID lethal conceivably could similar results time period given sluggish we‚Äôve develop deploy science.

I‚Äôll admit tho unlikely, believe excessive lethality hampers pathogens ability spread efficiently past certain level least kids got last week! happy.     wasn‚Äôt trying say exposure without vaccinated. thinking vaccines plus exposure. don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm kind rambling thoughts know probably still early enough data, anything breakthrough infections boosted? 

My mother in-laws, boosted, pressuring us visits too-young-to-be-vaccinated child (we live rather far them). spouse also boosted, parents much lackadaisical wearing masks go eat, etc.  promised much cautious leading visit. want deny visits, especially I'm overly anxious, concerned kid exposed (our kid home instead school much opportunity exposure point).

They're immunocompromised none side effects first two vaccinations mild reactions boosters. know possible mount effective immune response vaccine even one typical side effects, worry maybe they're riding response boosters.

On hand, since relatively recently boosted, figured better get visits done rather wait cases might surging even boosted immunity might waning. bad vaccinated happens they're syptomatic probably spread much. 

As immunity first shots wanes it'll get worse too. still greatly protected severe illness talking millions people slowly becoming susceptible catching/spreading. 

So boosters needed all. Right now. heard vaccinated Covid give robust immunity effect. Sorry, know source information came from.  NY data month behind..? upvoted comment, think valid point workers healthcare setting, X-ray technicians often bachelors, least associates degree, typically semester pharmacology. yes, X-ray tech knowledge know better. Also, there's also lot picked workplace, opportunity interaction people knowledgeable healthcare setting certainly exists. doctor appointment next Tuesday plan asking booster then. mine Saturday. Felt little tired later day, biggest effect sore arm days around shot. Moderna. mean actually understand germ theory it‚Äôs highly unlikely we‚Äôll get another pandemic like Black Plague anytime soon. 8-12 weeks shot 2

6 weeks max interval considered ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù CDC. last decades first world nations unnaturally safe compared human history every generation expected bunch people die. Even late 1800's normal half kids die age 5. 1800 normal 1/3 kids mothers die labor.    j&amp;j get moderna. nervous now! true children experience asymptomatic mild disease, get quite sick, small number die. It‚Äôs children vaccinated influenza, meningitis, chickenpox, hepatitis‚Äînone which, even vaccines available, killed many SARS-CoV-2 per year. one wants go office Christmas parties, trying kid? think might used qualifier, ""We're ***starting*** see..."", significant amount yet, wait becomes significant pointing trends. Police came pounding door warrant arrest ticking box Rite Aid's website. /s rest country, guys weird us out. vaccine better public health measure?  agree statement bit stretch. scientific community hesitant boosters largely argument using doses vaccinate rest world. idea waning protection need boosters, eventually, denounced also scientific accuracy needed. Honestly biggest issue new restriction point people mostly going observe probably people already 2-3 doses vaccine people likely thumb nose ignore people gotten vaccinated. effectively punishing people right thing. I'm saying good alternative, especially places hospitals filling again. stinks responsible people asked carry water responsible. I'm suggesting culling deer, would severe consequences ecosystem? 2nd shot Moderna April 9th. Asymptomatic 3 days developed cough week. Would known Covid hadn‚Äôt gotten tested. Nope. Op wants inform us, s/he simply provide bit info Agree stay vigilant. 11 year got first shot week ago husband fully vaccinated back April. COVID. far negative got booster 2 weeks ago 13 year vaccinated June. Thought everything right close getting youngest fully vaccinated still got through. time family member doctor believe vaccine. üò°  Yep. calculation.

According [Fast Facts U.S. Total Staffed Beds U.S. Hospitals 920k. US population 328M.

Gibraltar population 34k, 210 hospital beds.

If scale amount hospital beds Gibraltar US numbers, would 2M beds (328M √ó (210 / 34k)).

So Gibraltar twice hospital beds compared US, scaled population. count crime humanity result beneficial humanity? That's exactly did. Next week insanity even trying get booster green light everyone. Smart people going ""Sure, qualify"" fingers crossed behind back getting avoid that.  getting first one today!  really find hard believe. tick eligibility box online CVS Rite Aid they'll vaccinate questions asked.   got buster shot yesterday along flu shot....its obvious double jab shelf life wears off. probably going similar flu shot get every season. I'm fine long avoid severe illness death! theory? Sure. practice? I'm sure would've mattered much. 

So, instance argument PPE overlooks fact issue governments distribute PPE enough PPE globally go around. recall, biggest issue shortages masks (especially N95). solved global lockdowns. sounds like argument ""we reopen everything full never wear masks get vaccinated things slow even bad.""

Oh come on. I'm triple vaccinated. Vaccines proven effective measure primary method mitigation control. 

Masks mild moderately efficacious social settings, highly efficacious used properly medical settings. 100% support masks. article suggests lockdowns efficacious, keep mind within framework various interaction effects provide data diminishing returns time (and associated costs.) Would two month lockdown better one? three month lockdown? Six months? What's inflection point lockdowns hurt help? Vaccines never hit point. Masks never hit point. Ive also multiple vaccines due orders transfer overseas - make feel pretty crappy. opinion, shouldn‚Äôt complaint aimed crappy employers nagging want time work medical event? Instead actual push vaccine every year? Idk.  live age nothing lasts news cycle we‚Äôre next problem/outrage. People exhausted unknown.  really?   Short answer last question: don‚Äôt know yet. Immunologists think may durable 3rd dose, similar vaccines work (usually takes 2-3 doses durable immunity even many boosters 5-10 years). way know long it‚Äôs year since first people vaccinated clinical trials. immunologists doctors also think close spacing first two doses ended looking like one dose immune system, since takes time immune system build response, third dose really like dose 2. Studies underway believe countries longer intervals doses 1 2 like UK.  hospitalizations.

First cases rise, hospitalizations rise, deaths rise.   Nuh-uh. Things binary subtlety grey area. either it‚Äôs 100% ‚Äútaken ride!‚Äù That'd fine analogy rich countries plan ever get vaccines out. preventing countries manufacturing IP laws. does. treadmill home, would much rather run outside simply fresh air. state declaring entire state population high risk. That's untrue encouraging people get booster false pretenses. Yes, conditions make qualify booster. Lessons thalidomide running trials children prior authorizing shots them. know frustrating people kids 5 now, requirements test population good reasons. Sounds like subscription service planet on? Shit normal since mask mandates lifted. state little 50% vaccinated. vaccine. exactly went got booster CVS complete disregard qualifications. Technically I'm sure fell category (they super broad cover huge swath people probably think qualify). still taking chances breakthrough statistic panel utterly dragging feet putting people danger result. meant freedom worrying might happen kids got Delta. know chances small might bad case, 2 year old nephew hospitalized Delta weeks ago trouble breathing. fine now, really dont want deal level parental terror dont to. needed. Boosters original vaccines provide excellent protection delta. example, moderna‚Äôs booster raises neutralizing antibody titers delta 42-fold. likely multiple times needed neutralize delta clip original vaccine regimen neutralized original virus.

We may need make updated vaccines point, time, resources, effort, confusion attempting delta would far outweigh potential small (if any) benefit so. wasn‚Äôt widespread discouragement, also wasn‚Äôt widespread encouragement. that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying happened.  things like suing OSHA mandate due question government authority following normal processes.

Anyway, I'll think twice going again. Obviously pro vax, outside force compelled get but, actual covid though longer duration bad endure. manage large groups people sometimes asking people vaccine cards always end sort issue. People truly paranoid issue. Thanks. I‚Äôm interested. It‚Äôs lot work try follow even main stories happening worldwide. I'll point less 2 months ago FDA VRBPAC refused recommend boosters adults even really want approve anyone 65 (they reword questions vote multiple times). this.  Mind sharing received first two doses?

By Linda Searing November 15, 2021 8:00 a.m. EST


At least 50 percent people survive covid-19 experience variety physical psychological health issues six months initial recovery, according research long-term effects disease, published journal JAMA Network Open.

Tracker: U.S. coronavirus cases, deaths hospitalizations
Often referred ‚Äúlong covid,‚Äù adverse health effects vary person person. research, based data 250,351 adults children, found half experience decline general well-being, resulting weight loss, fatigue, fever pain.


About 20 percent decreased mobility, 25 percent trouble thinking concentrating (called ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù), 30 percent develop anxiety disorder, 25 percent breathing problems, 20 percent hair loss skin rashes. Cardiovascular issues ‚Äî chest pain palpitations ‚Äî common, stomach gastrointestinal problems.


Those affected post-covid conditions, sometimes called ‚Äúlong haulers,‚Äù include anyone covid-19, even symptoms mild ones, according Centers Disease Control Prevention.

But additional research published subsequent issue journal found cognitive dysfunction occurred often among severe cases covid-19 required hospitalization, brain fog issues lingered seven months more. ‚ÄúOne‚Äôs battle covid doesn‚Äôt end recovery acute infection,‚Äù one researcher said.

Could long covid unlock clues chronic fatigue poorly understood conditions?

‚Äî‚ÄâLinda Searing


where deception?  depressingly brutal stuff, kids survived actual Holocaust(!) went lead rich, full, normal lives afterward. loved, lived worst shit imaginable, love got early allowed heal grow.

The pandemic pretty modest compared experience. such, I've largely focused making kids feel happy/safe trust they'll good shape grow up. don‚Äôt think experience typical. long history severe complications allergic reactions vaccines. assumed fine J&amp;J would mean fine booster didn‚Äôt discuss first doctor. think overall OK vaccines, you‚Äôll fine Moderna Moderna boost Tuesday little sore yesterday along feeling tired today soreness injection site.  Depends state read article? sometimes not.  Like doses still get wasted everyday people confused whether they're 85% adults approved CDC guidelines. here. Mine changes based states daily numbers silly.  daughter five want world get better feels like getting worse worse. Lol. Pathetic. covid?  agree worth \*looks like\* Covid + vaccine end game 'acceptable' position Western democratic societies without additional measures.

But entirely plausible calculus apply countries, two-tier world arises. \*we\* 'diseased third world' yellow card vaccine (cf Yellow Fever) testing requirements apply visit civilized East. now?  Getting booster shot later today. got J&amp;J shot March. getting Moderna booster. Unfortunately misplaced vaccine card moved last month. picture immunization record state know I‚Äôll able get new card booster it‚Äôs still frustrating won‚Äôt everything one place. I've read studies refuting say otherwise, looking directly effect mask quality vs mask droplets, anecdotal case studies. 

Either way rock n95s wish CDC would push there's shortage like beginning pandemic. fact loosely worn bandanas acceptable joke. How's freedom panning though guy?  mother died morning. estranged last time saw begged hug me. told antivaxer. Turns already infected virus. $1000 dose, would cost like half trillion fully cover US (including overhead etc). bonus, put clotting agents, graphene, heavy metals, 5G chips liquid AI vaccines!  No, like Shadow PC Discord server boost  actually super helpful reassuring. Thank taking time respond it‚Äôs nice hear people feel way/ situation. try keep things normal possible them.  go zero knowledge virus we're (millions lives saved something close normal-ish returning many us) nothing short scientific miracle. like space program going Mercury Moon Landing months. want sound Pollyanna, we've gone lockdowns mass death return many features life short time. hell achievement.   anti-maskers use **exact** study say right. Thanks advice. I'm due second shot 27th.  vaccine ineffective variants right ? kids relatively safe far I‚Äôve heard. still spread virus even vaccinated right ?
Why vaccinating kids ? Honest questions  would consult doctor specific case concerns.

From I've read, first dose trigger life-threatening reaction, doses even less likely to. doctor. Well story got dark rather quickly. admit mistake point? Acting like healthy person walking around without covid vaccine similar someone knowingly spreading AIDS, typhoid mary killing people path little ridiculous Ok may take time less convenient moment Covid.     Nobody taking anything away.

That's completely dishonest people losing job getting vaccine, certain cities can't go restaurant, bar, tons places. Saying ""there simply consequences"" removal rights. Yes. People stupid self serving assholes. large part population. Look EU, dozen countries can't get 50% people get vaccinated. Stupid assholes. company always hybrid, kinda weird apple honest, even work major tech company, department major retail company... It‚Äôs Walgreen‚Äôs that‚Äôs went for. said pandemic causes lot 20/20 hindsight. Waiting another 3 months opinions change what‚Äôs better leaves exposed. think either one help give immune system boost again. Japan vaccinated slower later.

So yet significant waning young children makes sad live this.

I well consolation, I've read quite bit robust kids' psyches kind thing. caring parents preserve something like normal them, they'll come lot less affected fear be. Covid kills extremely low percentage healthy people, I'm sure calling existential threat anywhere close appropriate. talking forced sterilization, tracker implants, national approved dress code.

You said that, me. topic vaccines fully disclaim there's evidence safe pregnant women, effect fertility either men women. Happy provide source want. yet every single person still forced take it?

The problem government deciding medical treatment people get without individuals allowed make decision power immediately abused whatever want. could use population experiment whatever drug want try out, power refuse it. cons giving power far outweigh benefit  Yep. Mentally hardest part pandemic noticing scientifically illiterate lot people (and I've thinking decades oh wow underestimate problem) willing live imaginary reality, means climate change humanity's future potential. see places like US Singapore, forcing unvaccinated pay covid treatment change much.

People want take vaccine simply take vaccine, go hospital get sick enough covid, matter much pay.

So effectively, want shield hospitals unvaccinated, way really deny treatment.  booster less year later? common.  best way live within current reality. really bad mentally accept things.

Me friends family vaccinated (and boosted based availability). hang regularly. There's risk, we've made peace it. modest inconveniences still deal terms COVID abatement. game changers. compare life like like year ago, remotely same. hope inconveniences safely go away future. I'm also going sit around dreaming global time machine take us back Fall 2019. Awesome, would love get booster holiday travel Whelp, works me. Time make Facebook post!

Flu cases way last year COVID wasn't. Also, know flu we're still learning COVID.

My view government invested ton get vaccines within year want make priority one. think natural immunity 0qrt convo regarding mandates. ""Approved Covid narratives only"", got it.

(Obviously one policing rules silly people able get booster regardless. supporting previous poster's assertion anxiety probably technically qualify based CDC list.)  None said transpiring People catch viruses every year, all. flu goes around every year caught again. also know covid also caught multiple times. That's people think become seasonal virus like flu. I'd love proportionally hear everyone's voice issue, dead people could reply Reddit comment would absolutely drowned out.

You entitled opinion, I'm entitled tired it. That's true. that, like we're seeing COVID, healthy people carry much risk help spread disease vulnerable. years flu vaccine shots down, flu deaths always rise.

Getting flu vaccine bulletproof neither COVID shot, help slow spread disease decreasing infections spread. helps keep elders vulnerable people (cancer patients, immunocompromised, etc.) ICU morgue.  Get Moderna! covid spread midnight. thought done dumb restrictions sake ""doing something"". dangerous pubs open, close them. solves nothing. work retail would consider qualifying high risk since went purposefully vague interact hundreds people day it‚Äôs closely plus I‚Äôm Florida personally I‚Äôm getting booster coming weeks.  Well, got one so...   never claimed majority. lot people got assss kicked days vaccine. invalidate experience others want hear.  also case AstraZeneca?

That‚Äôs point. don‚Äôt exist. many vaccines taken one (or even few) dose set life? many advertised one dose asked come back second dose couple months later?

Again: nobody ever said getting fully immunized meant would need shots future.

Paul Offitt publicly disagreed Director CDC, lets say whether data followed question. Leana Wen, emergency physician former Baltimore health commissioner, called CDC panel‚Äôs vote reject boosters widely ‚Äúmistake.‚Äù

Are seriously suggesting CDC wrong ACIP right? retrospect?  US failed make impossible.

Many countries managed zero covid successfully intentionally transitioned endemic instead currently way zero covid strategy. people unable clear infection sustain extended period time, body basically environment virus thrive in. Due existing higher levels, accumulates mutations quickly. 

The alpha variant believed originated way. Took Moderna booster yesterday. Felt milliseconds sharp pain left deltoid (injection left arm). Woke today body feels like trash. whole body sore feel hotter usual.   Political good understand you‚Äôre fatigued, think people regretted getting vaxxed dying horrific death - alone. Please don‚Äôt care you. Peace love way friend. let know scared needles; get xanax something relax you.  countries could positive case studies messaging?   think bot likes you...

It would interesting know many deaths vaccine actually caused vaccine. those, person issue catching Covid would also fatal?     put others risk of... piece cloth? Seriously?  Really, hard would CDC beginning Covid say ""Yes, face masks effective, paper medical masks short supply right recommend buying making cloth masks instead disposables reserved healthcare staff. Covering nose mouth mask get best option.""

I can't sugarcoat it, Americans pretty ignorant medicine, hygiene biology general compared lot countries, assuming we're stupid petulant children *need misled good* pretty effective way undermine authority. know anyone thought CDC pure evil C-19, portion populace thinks are, doing. 3 shots - driving, getting shot, waiting 15 minutes, driving home - took collectively 2 hours. 

It one least tiring things pandemic.     laid today, got yesterday. identical second, also got flu time. I'm unsure that, mostly Moderna booster ""half strength"" compared full Moderna get part 2-dose series.

I think J&amp;J + Moderna booster still ""fully vaccinated"", though.  Science doesn‚Äôt care vaccine hesitant people think. facts facts  Maybe 70% gotten wouldn‚Äôt stuck needing 3rd doses Yes vaccine requirements, forcing everyone wear masks. punishes vaccinated.

It sucks, perfectly reasonable response facts understand them.  stat actually kind misleading. 177 review data showed, review, people died covid. actuality, 32 deaths day.    boat you. booster, lost balance, could barely walk week. think again, honestly.  Moderna Pfizer since July. get booster ASAP, wait 6 months initially recommended? Technically wait January, I've read before.   let get straight, made argument using completely incorrect information/data someone pointed started accusing argumentative saying don‚Äôt understand science‚Ä¶.seems like definition ‚Äúscience‚Äù internet tells immune system hyper reaction entire body broke hives 2nd shot.

I agree this. I'm frustrated people throw hands say ""forget it!"" without bothering learn even little bit disease we're facing getting frustrated guidance changes time.

And yes, CDC/FDA rest abysmal response this. dispute that. largely, generally right course, little slow respond. got downvoted hell months ago saying would get j j would wait one others. glad waited. understanding:

If kept around full set antibodies every antigen ever ran life, blood would end thick flow.  antibodies naturally wane make space new ones.  hang memory B cells (grandparents antibodies); bump antigen start cranking antibody factories (plasma cells). 

So running antigen period time trigger antibody production nudge immune system keeping family antibodies around longer.

So appropriately spaced vaccinations trick immune system keeping antibodies around longer would.

There also mechanisms (like various forms cells) learn infection vaccination similar way. state, also need comorbidities.

1. one checking comorbidities.

2. claim ""former smoker"" easily. Ever puff one? Congrats, ""former smoker"".

I wish family best.  top head, 2 vaccine series done 2 shots one month apart booster 6 months later way.

A small bit uncertainty payoff vaccines developed quickly. possible booster enough, likely we'll get shot yearly.

As long large pool unvaccinated people thing continues mutate them, uncertainty going get worse. Unless got kids dose (which would probably highly effective), dose. that's awesome! anyone else fully vaccinated, caught covid showed symptoms? fully vaxxed technically May (2nd dose Moderna late April).

About 25% Ireland's total population likely unvaccinated entirely, unclear percentage 75% vaccinated boosted, things going able spread quite unvaccinated populations cause breakthrough infections among vaccinated populations immunity conferred. matter? Getting vaccinated objectively better taking chances actual covid infection. Nice! I'm seeing Poison Well.

I‚Äôd think would intersection point immunity downward trend therefore symptoms immune response would upward trend. 

Obviously clue I‚Äôm talking about, wondering aloud. fine now, sore throat, even know without doctor sending get PCR test .... even fever, nothing.  Hundreds thousands people dying normal. need stop living past. sound like grandparents thought bringing TVs home stupid. It‚Äôs outdated way thinking.   main reason different previous respiratory diseases never caught before. noticing differences versus diseases - instance crosses blood-brain barrier, done - hard separate fact adult first-time infections we're studying.

There's also sort funny mathematical oddity occurring months back vaccine distribution even skewed toward vulnerable populations now.

My take this:
1) vaccines still pretty good
2) may need get 1/4 population boosters point get enough dead end hosts put us least intermediate term herd immunity. Figure recent infections, okay protection remaining non-boosted push us edge.
3) we're probably getting close point exposures highly vaxed settings really concern. Like get letting people direct proximity know, think we're past sending email entire company building covid case. [Son, think mean Planeteers

Yes, reports students asking get infected get covid pass. Morons ask me. don‚Äôt ask. got mine last week CVS. people r/COVID19 argued Bangladesh study critical flaws point useless: Also masks great winter. Keep face nice warm  severe breakthrough cases? 

Are guys seeing lot hospitalizations vaccinated people? even deaths vaccinated people breakthrough infection? 

Side note: places want visit, Ireland top list. Maybe one day. 70% hit herd immunity based original strain. delta strain, you‚Äôll need 90% vaccination rate hit herd immunity. that‚Äôs vaccine 100% effective. Basically herd immunity impossible current vaccines. sure booster shots though So, rough approximation, none gotten it. even many polling indicated would (around 25%).

I guess end ""wait kids get vaccinated"" argument. They're going get disease. shame. hope help sure! Antivax idiots=higher risk exposure. Go get it. mileage may vary course.

Literally case.  Oh good, phew. I've heard people following husband's experience always makes anxious everyone gets looked into!

I'm sure move soon? He‚Äôs asking people right thing (getting boosted) giving reason best questionable. really seeing uptick hospitalization among people vaccinated two doses? so, metric? won‚Äôt go far call wrong, may well right, would want see hard data I‚Äôm convinced.

Do also cases people purposely infecting instead getting vaccinated? new trend Austria, first patient died recently. That's insanity even higher level... Omfg   Good thing got booster scheduled next week I‚Äôm already looking forward 4th! GOOD. Fuck unvaccinated. fully vaccinated well.

How long ago last shot, serious presentation? family ireland. 90% elibible population vaccinated. ireland last week. need vaccine card mask go pretty much everywhere. Yet cases high starting bring back restrictions everyone convinced another lockdown new year.

Do vaccines work? Yes. would probably already lockdown given high cases rn vaccines. 

Are vaccines golden ticket shitty situation thought would be? Sadly looks like thats  randomized; meta-analysis based already questionable studies. Garbage in, garbage out. Bangladesh study much better. seems delta variant really resistant vaccines.

AFAIK, actually resistant earlier strains, really, really fast. fine still high circulating antibodies, fall back slightly slower response memory B cells (longer term immunity), Delta basically race gate body jump start antibody production. still provides good protection far serious cases, that's good.   time come..... Got mine two days ago. bit early maybe opportunity there. got boosted Tuesday completely yesterday, felt like got hit bus yesterday.

Damn, time get boost mobile Ooof man, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm check carding Christmas. can‚Äôt imagine state stores right  unreal much company spent plexiglass...every piece least cost Honeywell HPA300 HEPA filter (that's model cost analysis on), times two three counting installed costs. hundreds full size pieces plexiglass, every person common areas. can't help think, much better everyone would ~1,000 HEPA filters instead.  Same, came shopping district small town, looking shop, many people wearing masks, 240 incidence area. rediculous. entirely relevant. exact reason rational.

Once 5+ crowd got approved vaccines, everyone really seemed forget rest us. really isn‚Äôt even promising news anymore. üòî certain already qualify?

Not making light situation I‚Äôm suggesting expectation vaccinated boosted prevent breakthroughs happening depressed eligible according CDC guidelines. I'm stating facts, feel you.

Singapore almost 90% vaccinated yet 100x surge cases 6 weeks. regulatory framework changing places (CA, NY, etc.) change everyone next days.  exactly (the pharmacy) say, and/or require? vast majority seen require personal affidavit (really check box) saying qualify understand it. Yes different dilution, can't give accurate dose volume liquid small. read mix-ups happening made sure pharmacist used orange cap vial kids. perhaps unsettling feeling knowledge still developed amended (with findings pointing one way others pointing another), rather already given us past corpus. new virus, vaccines developed it. simply less two years data virus, vaccines work virus, etc. Lots people want certainty, certainty can't certainty right now. see mention /r/science thread whether infected uninfected *both* masked. improves mask protection significantly, according study, other, credible studies. 

This behavior need see, overwhelmingly see. US basically optional, people wear whatever subjective reason do/don't. shitshow. Despite wear safest kinds masks available, acceptable (no vent) wear snugly, since studies efficacy well, feel confident unilateral mask wearing brings protection 45-ish range. Yeah worst you‚Äôre taking dose antivaxxer go get boost We'll see boosted immunity holds up, far none really unexpected, least always known potential scenario. spacing original two shot sequences pretty much absolute minimum necessary, known tradeoff longer term immunity favor getting trials arms quick possible. two shot sequences space least several months, longer, require three shots. There's pretty good chance original series + booster provide long term immunity, unless stuck ultra-rapid Delta-style variants need continuous high circulating antibodies, case we'll see. people done masking pointless anyway  shot get? I‚Äôm eligible got Pfizer isn‚Äôt *yet*because got moderna Target population=anyone older 12 mean, vaccines rolling out, public health experts supposed predict Delta would strong variant? supposed know exactly much efficacy brand-new, cutting-edge vaccines would wane time?

This think it. Let's say get booster. immune system recognizes virus pumps antibodies clear again. antibodies still bloodstream encountered Covid 19 wild would theoretically almost immune infection entirely.

Severe illness happens immune system figures correct counter-attack strategy. knows almost right away, that's good get mild symptoms. Maybe none.

The question really is, much ""training"" immune system ""good enough.""
And ""Max level"" even achieved?
 
0 training- vax- obviously bad.                  
2 shots - based hospitalization data still think pretty damn good.                    
3 shots - ??? really, know. question really ""train"" immune system much preparedness 2 shots? 

Based I've seen, experienced, I'm still convinced boosters really needed people, think prioritized people weaker immune systems maybe benefit additional ""training"". 
Vaccine production retargeted focus countries still struggling get enough vaccines first 2 doses. boosters made whatever...

Hope analogies sort help, make went. really taken absolute authority this. trying stay best informed myself. also confusing states said everyone get booster. I'm 6months 2nd shot qualify booster according qualifications listed, everyone seem know gotten one. got moderna x3.

Basically keeping everyone company safe separated anti vaxers applaud get going soon. Don‚Äôt worry, enough people getting vaccine virus mutate again.  healthcare professionals knowledge know better

Do though? personally know field (for example x-ray tech) barely would call higher education. Thanks response. I'm young, physically fit, nothing health-wise complicate case. I'm surprised feel worse time got 2020, although I'm sure something different strains.

Should concern getting false negative getting booster? long wait get booster come back positive? actually disagree with?

You think countries ready? think China model follow liberal democracies?

I noted least three democracies well: ROK, ROC NZ. ""stupidity"" display here? 

I really think liberal democracies great job, need learn lot ROK/ROC, really emulate one dystopian authoritarian regimes world today? 

Everything balance, rights matter long COVID endemic managed. Sometimes appropriate follow rules. good meme mix-and-match study small (50 subjects per combination) structured provide well-controlled comparisons (among things, different pairings ended different distributions intervals doses).

The single-vendor studies larger (but much larger); general CDC/FDA conservatism (staying close center what's well tested) resulted preference using vaccine primary series booster. point, even follow rules? get much it.

From I've seen entire pandemic, public health messaging rules always step behind virus. We're always acting late. husband hesitant we're waiting. initial study large enough identify rare adverse events, know solid idea incidence December. daughter also covid already, I'll look affects things.

I surprised quite parents waiting early birds get fully vaccinated see goes. I'm personally overly worried AEs expect get shot January, feel terribly pressured covid months ago anyway. It'll nice quarantine school exposures though.

I think anyone start January pretty unlikely willingly get though. Compared Black Plague Medieval Europe (*killed 30-60% Europe‚Äôs total pop*) COVID‚Äôs toll (killed perhaps .33% total US pop) mild, even without vaccines. hard say bad would back clean drinking water, adequate nutrition, etc.

But get pandemic death toll like Black Death Middle Ages, really fukin‚Äô scary. know. We'll see. interesting 15 days. Lotta societies would care enough kids could least skip grift middle deadly pandemic, I'm saying. us, though. yes, look  Israel's case rate stayed pretty low mass boosting campaign, seems like third shot longer lasting protection, there's decent chance boosted well enough could locally eradicate COVID least get low numbers Yes, fixing climate change without changing habitat destruction fishing practices automatically improve biodiversity. Come now. watch school board meeting madness masking think- community input public education actually good thing? seems necessary would also hold us back. Glad username literally means boosted. Yup, people really struggle accept fact understanding virus, like many things, *evolving*.

And there‚Äôs stuff don‚Äôt yet understand, working towards it. redditors really naive think scitech. post moderator. look deleted Yeah disgusts folks trying pull shit, religion fringe interpretation see life important protect what's even point? Maybe better chance beds available hospital. Many people around breakthrough infections two doses. Disease severity times lower without vaccination, older people still really bad news. probably contagious symptoms show, fight much faster without vaccination.

If ends Covid, get third dose. Trivial infections reason stop vaccinating. one called false contraindications, following guide german RKI:

Should vaccinations given despite illnesses?

Often indicated vaccinations given certain circumstances mistakenly viewed contraindications. known surveys studies one main reasons low vaccination coverage contraindications, often misunderstood doctors used improperly. therefore pointed again, especially context, common infections, even associated subfebrile temperatures (‚â§ 38.5 ¬∞ C = 101.3 F), contraindication vaccination.

Other false contraindications e.g .:

A possible contact vaccinee people infectious diseases,

Family seizures

Febrile convulsions anamnesis vaccinee (since febrile vaccination reactions provoke seizure, consideration given giving antipyretic drugs children tendency convulsions: e.g. case dead vaccines time vaccination 4 8 hours vaccination well case MMR vaccination 7th 12th day event temperature increase),

Eczema,

Dermatoses,

localized skin infections,

Treatment antibiotics low doses corticosteroids topical steroid-containing preparations,

Pregnancy mother vaccinee,

congenital acquired immunodeficiencies vaccinated dead vaccines,

Neonatal jaundice,

Prematurity: premature babies vaccinated according recommended vaccination age regardless birth weight,

chronic illnesses well
non-progressive diseases CNS.

Indicated vaccinations carried particular people chronic diseases, since people particularly risk due severe course complications vaccine-preventable diseases. People chronic diseases educated benefits vaccination compared risk disease. reliable knowledge flare-ups occurring time vaccination could caused vaccination. actually even known problem poor cognitive function. even young adults whose brains haven‚Äôt finished developing. Ugh open eyes unplug ears realize there‚Äôs actually building fire. issue Delta immune system recognize it. Delta very, rapidly multiplies mucus membranes brute force overwhelms immune system. really overestimate public's ability take data able understand changes literally day day

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* NIH study also used full dose Moderna, showed Moderna booster increasing antibodies 17.3x vs. Pfizer's 14.9x. terribly significant.

Singapore's health ministry says getting Moderna booster receiving Pfizer initial series decreases infection risk 72% vs. 62% get another Pfizer dose. sure used full half dose Moderna. 

Basically, need data. personally chose Moderna booster, think perfectly reasonable stick Pfizer. Eh, I'd say somewhere middle, testing issue. Delta's ability come extremely rapidly (1-2 days, vs. 3-5+ previous strains) high viral loads means significant symptomatic COVID longer term immune response still getting gear. Fortunately, seems like disease progression still delayed response still enough prevent worst outcomes cases. study says ‚Äúbest non pharmaceutical intervention‚Äù. article headline bad. hope reactions become less severe, too. partner got bad reactions second Pfizer shot - sore armpit booster. Hopefully won‚Äôt bad you. change coming winter. going dark.  curious, why? believe British slang that's come common usage recently. You‚Äôre right. every day pandemic thought screwed climate change based public reaction pandemic.  Moderna bigger dose gives immunity many side effects. booster smaller still bigger dose Pfizer. 

If under-30 man would get smallest dose possible, 60 largest. Otherwise really matter. third dose incredibly effective regardless side effects almost short lived. performance vaccines close. initial studies reported slightly better results Pfizer, new ones report Moderna slightly better (maybe Delta, maybe keeps immunity better). differences couple percentage points, chances are, really matter ;)

For worth, Pfizer Moderna booster.

That's works. memory B cells retain coding remake antibodies immune system kept blood full antibodies viruses ever encountered blood would flow like molasses.

That's really true. varies disease disease exposure exposure, many circulating antibodies maintained extended periods, especially response Anyone already can. Besides fact nobody local Cvs‚Äôs even asking anyway, requirements booster things like overweight mental health issues. What, doctor gonna ask see lexapro prescription?

I strongly believe virus originated one China's wild animal farms wild animals (as opposed domesticated animals) kept cramped conditions cages different natural habitat. Chinese government promoted cultivation wild animals increase prosperity rural regions narrow wealth gap cities. Wild rare animals fetch higher price domesticated animals. Wealthy Chinese willing pay high price kick getting exotic dish supposed special health effects.

The stress wild animals experience unnatural surroundings explain diseases cramped conditions make sure infectious diseases transmitted. 

I would surprised Chinese know exactly farm came from. cake lie.  guess MAANG now? MANGA flows better.  dose

(ofc NHS would fund it, they'd get much better deal) common deadly highly communicable virus spread globally idiots allowed mutate   longer wait give second dose benefit it. Second doses given +1 month like half value +3 months. Taken extreme, second dose anyone 50 could probably dropped entirely.

Instead we're giving second doses 1 month first, almost everywhere still. we're giving second doses 40-year olds give first doses 15-year olds, almost everywhere. Delta pandemic magically end give third doses 60-year olds. requires 20-year olds 6+ months first dose. Starting timer ASAP exceeds value dose, regardless recipients' ages.

Try time. fly list Still worth it. Good you. (0.47, 0.29 0.75) mean masking could reduce spread anywhere 25% 71%? That's wide margin error so. is. Grow up.  also holidays logistically complicated time year kids 12 imagine eager, yet scheduled, parents well. think really save face. Like saying ‚Äúhey something!‚Äù Doesn‚Äôt matter works not. Sure, 1 doses little prevent transmission. Even two doses provides small short-term protection transmission (given breakthrough) medium-term protection infection. need 3 doses young protect elderly. enough give 2nd dose elderly person 1st dose healthy young person, elderly person benefit much getting shot directly. elderly friends get 2nd 3rd doses well.  certainly allowed that, though know continue believe existence germs clear consequences infected particular germ. 


Reality care tired it.  Yep that's good point. Since 10 years idea head get stage gonna scramble everything fix this,full speed,Ai, quantum computing,fussion etc. may late though fucking curious much accomplished actually try. Time tell.  Well need immune system right. subscribe , safe effective trade :-)  Masks public places probably norm able reach point hospitalizations remain plateaued even restrictions lifted. hospitalizations per 100k unvaccinated: 44.7  hospitalizations per 100k vaccinated: 4.5.

The data still shows one path safer (but perfect). path remotely safe. ""former smoker"" super broad people probably like smoked cigar something Fire them. fucking mercy.  mRNA vaccines last 3 days body (mRNA vaccine limited quantity fragile).

Imagine actual COVID-19 would made feel.

All reaction spike protein.  boosted Phizer getting Moderna last winter mild symptoms. absolutely could worked next day took advatage fact can't report symptims however mild even day innoculation lovely day off. I'm afraid third shot going problem. Even people taken seriously far it. Motb fear get worse slowly enough people by-and-large notice much fear get acute enough motivate *actual* changes late. us vaccinated. go ahead stop‚Ä¶ Sunday. Sunday chores expected bad reaction. Instead, felt great. swear knocked funk flu shot put days earlier. Honestly, likely moot point shortly. Right now, however, local experts near saying past 6 months boosted. Fauci said national level everyone need boosters. state saying get booster everyone past 6 months. hear plenty experts supporting boosters.

At least, past 6 months, remask public. still likely get serious illness, likely susceptible catching again.     Thanks. read them. might explain South Africa controlling wave well. Go check stats. 3 perfect waves. getting booster unlikely change anything them.

It supply issue much funding logistics issue. wife ran eligible ourselves. risk unknowns seem less concerning us. mention risk bad outcome much higher, even though we're healthy (relatively) young.

We discussed getting son vaccinated definitely comfortable giving months see goes, things considered. districts? heard Tucson. phoenix see happening.  Same. Can‚Äôt book appointment month. article notes gap hospitalization rate vaccinated unvaccinated people smaller older patients. Also, vaccinated people overrepresented data, since everyone brought even something else tested. go ICU something else yet asymptomatic case COVID.

I would say 'overrepresented', represented correctly unlike somewhere tests symptomatic. might want read errors report. paper article describe them. logic, swimming first place. might drown. inconvenient temporary flu, meaningful threat hospitalization death.

my real hope that, catch soon enough take meds, able halt damage cells/nerves nose also organ damage. 

I'm concerned hospitalization death still get left life-long issues potentially even mild case. pills help decrease chances things like long covid etc even mild cases, saying true end pandemic sure. reality majority people hospitalized die anyway, left rolling dice weird post-covid symptoms linger.

Really fingers crossed treatment. Go look Ireland's numbers. deaths high peak rising significantly. Same. moderna booster felt side effects. stronger reaction second shot third. explained perfectly. Ohio's worse. worry kids point. know many anti vaxx parents. children get sick, nothing it. kids protected.   still get Tetanus booster every decade. I‚Äôm crazy term either doesn‚Äôt bother quite much, that‚Äôs probably it‚Äôs phrase grew hearing. None matters grand scheme things, one things make roll eyes. Life goes on. Unfortunately can't. exactly it, get daughter vaccinated soon could get in. yesterday found teacher (vaccinated) tested positive covid. I'm definitely glad least week head start first dose, cautionary pull ""wait see"" strong. I'm frustrated sick it, understand hesitancy especially beginning.

I think part it, least myself, much fear place pregnant mothers general. There's huge list things can't eat, can't (even baths risk pregnant üòë). right start there's external pressure fear something wrong affect child. fear covid fear vaccine, understand parents might want split difference waiting see goes. kids pretty much first line. Went Wednesday opened everyone. 2nd coming next Wednesday. Feels much better got protection school. 

Both excited get absolutely zero side effects. even sore arm.  Ah gotcha. Could try somewhere else close might strict. pretty hard find real-world studies masks alone, almost always combined measures.  Stop trying apply logic common sense political situation.

It make sick. No, people go get shots strict eligibility. Wait, people really get $8. even first became aide paid low. make zero sense. 

First person reported unconnected market November 2019. 
Did people continuously throw shit wall see stick? idea. friend lost yellow book well got one free. digital vaccination passwort free well. Strange. I‚Äôm going going home family holiday season, including 95 year old grandfather. bet ass I‚Äôm using mental illness excuse get booster. Probably. Gas prices supply demand increased demand still limited supply drives prices up. 

Cynically speculate it‚Äôs related slowly dying oil industry trying shore value stock calendar year end. think they're talking specific post. Same. outdoor things, visiting vaccinated family/friends, playdates park, etc, stressful navigating unknown environments (especially indoors). want stop risk assessment head everyday. Oh good. least way parents increased incentive vaccinate kids. interesting assume someone came different conclusion did, questioned anything.

Maybe wrong smart think are, hear there's horse medicine take care that. getting shot better? Gonna need alot die people wise  dumb   meant person replied making reference. can't expect people lockdown dance years. idk option C We're watching knowledge accumulation realtime. fact is, millions lives saved far even 2 dose protection waning. We'll know well 3 dose works March. We're hopeful 3rd dose leads longer protection, world going end need booster twice year. Everything considered, vaccines work well pretty amazing. Thank you! pay attention seems like variants downplayed sort bubble along suddenly goes boom! LOL!

And wait year find Picard escapes Borg!   foolish don‚Äôt change guidelines kids. data says going lot 2nd shot sick kids. Almost 10x many covid sick kids 5-12 group. shall see 4 weeks time. Keep mind CDC reacts data extremely slowly. said, fever child end world, day school work, I‚Äôd rather deal read Pfizer study closely.  Oh man sorry hear. 18-25 range? Canada: 0% got booster Monday even though I‚Äôm 18 weeks pregnant felt fine. almost concerned didn‚Äôt feel worse haha. source read chance?  Nope, all. care less Aaron Rodgers. always told like 1/3rd 2nd dose...hmmm.... Wow sound really smart, I'm happy you.  He's making joke Aaron Rodgers said ""immunized"" meant taken BS homeopathic remedy, vaccine. That's bit bold call 'most vaccinated place world' basically microstate. much less likely caught covid. impossible. ""The rules"" arbitrary differ depending live, wrong. might stupid question I'm educated biology vaccines. say blood keep around full set antibodies thickens much. Spaced vaccinations trick body keeping antibodies sticking around longer would otherwise. 

What benefit that? also remember hearing antibodies one aspect immunity low antibody levels necessarily correlate poor immune response. 

Does antibodies launch immune response faster? robustly?

Is downside tricking body keep antibodies around longer? Would downside got several vaccines once? 

I know they've said there's problem getting covid shot flu shot day. 

I've never heard described way would like understand little better, basic terms. Sadly overheard today homeschooling group canceled museum visit students. parents reminded morning masks required cancelled mask requirements. tonight? 
Want hang beer? 
Damn reply hit mark!!!  People dumb; that's matter fact, unfortunate reality. Society education system made us way resounding numbers.

A teacher know made comment months ago masks even work. even bother wasting time explaining anything haha. Must've came across disinformation misinformation angles studies citing masks work, conveniently leaving fact they're talking gaitors thin cloths peoples faces.

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously also understand loose fitting, dangling mask thing. seriously would bother, hassle much mask fits well. Like mention often, KF94's wear quite comfortable actually forget even often, almost want say feel nice cold haha. even touch lips mouth, ever really feel need adjust mess on.  23.000 Netherlands 17m people. Yup. Completely unnecessary harmful environment boot. Maybe rigid definitional sense doctors going weigh differently daily smoking. We're enjoying nice reprieve right now. Unfortunately, cases starting tick back weeks decline. December might little rough, Merck Pfizer's oral treatments, start becoming available weeks, offer hope. here. overseas trip month ago. Went two weeks left get booster, hell qualifications.  think data suggests efficacy wane slower antibodies ""higher"" quality, however can't really find definitive source this. would suggest protection lasts lot longer 3 doses compared 2.     quit going gym put mask mandate back. Eventually went tried saw everyone restaurant thing wear door work like normal. I‚Äôve (there‚Äôs plenty open space) don‚Äôt fear anymore. I‚Äôm happy still get work haven‚Äôt much sniffle 4 months. 

All risk tolerance though. ""final straw"" lot people fence listening experts. sudden 10s millions people going considered unvaccinated again. Yikes. sure complete lockdown necessary, small number people willing take jab. read article? Here‚Äôs national government must stand people die longer get adequate health care,‚Äù Ms. Rendi-Wagner told news conference Vienna Thursday. Deaths lagging indicator. theory‚Ä¶

I vacation planned southern Georgia fall month checked covid site daily transmission rates, case numbers, etc. month cases rose super high one point county visiting something nuts like 89% population covid (ever). think they‚Äôre period temporary (?) herd immunity due combo vaccinations +
natural immunity covid relatively recently. Pretty sure nuking everything would fastest way could bring cases down. Better pharmaceutical non-pharmaceutical measures. course secondary effect killing everyone would undesired people. 

After that, extreme levels isolation seems like could pretty effective. requires extreme authoritarianism enforce, would continue near indefinitely unless also enforced animals, would likely cause external harm. would effective virus. 

The claim non-claim begin with. There's always hidden assumptions made claims. think headlines need say ""vaccines best public health measure virus except things like extinction life."" Maybe making ""best"" claim rather state better than. day got approved children's hospitals Denver Colorado springs started making appointments two places grabbed one five-year-old. 

A days later opened whole state made another sooner appointment King Soopers last week. They'd deaths hospitalisations get vaccines. Currently one person ICU. Gottlieb thoughts: 

""The reality near term future, best opportunity put immunity population protect settings gatherings Thanksgiving Christmas boosters boosters boosters. I've said before, mixed messages need booster eligible one biggest missed opportunities pandemic.""

""As head Thanksgiving, going see pickup cases throughout United States, delta wave moving populated parts country. think wave infection going bad last Winter was.""

""If vaccinated second shot 6-8 months ago, gotten booster shot yet, would feel comfortable indoor event setting. need approve booster eligibility adults soon possible, need American people currently eligible seek right away."" Yes, want require booster allow unvaccinated get around test.  Yes, funny thing government tries ""copy"" German anticovid restrictions look something, even though Austria fucked almost lmao
Yeah cant even copy well. mutates fast enough become one infectious diseases history year. vaccines seem issue though, virus. need different mechanism delivery effective longer. want never required wear mask ever again. want international travel return normal. want fly without deal fucking masks. 

Whatever takes things happen, care. can‚Äôt move without requiring vax cards, fine. show vaccine get somewhere, masks. nothing cardio. basic that. cellular health, affected many different variables. Cardio much cellular health. However, cardio important, lol. Also, certain adults could get it. 65+ comorbitities hospital staff while, adults took couple months available Got booster knocked wife. Balance. Thanks post. Wrong reasoning me, I'll delete post.  Yep indeed. think worked non-pandemic situations like approving latest whateverinyoumab injection atopic dermatitis, pandemic, day late dollar short basically losing failing get ahead exponential curve. Yeah weird. armpit sore? guess European countries. $700 pretty dang cheap compared cost ICU stay. wish got immune feedback. 3 doses even yawn. I'm planning read depth later today work. posted study another reply thread wanted read though! want show vaccine card every time go somewhere shot that‚Äôs basically become flu shot don‚Äôt get bad can‚Äôt enjoy society? second Pfizer. Huge lymphatic swelling. also several studies people refuse follow restrictions like wearing masks. Results: show psychopathic traits. mental disorders seem play huge role.  mechanism possibility make COVID extinct unless get effective vaccine. definitely worried people lose interest getting 6 month booster going years longer wave wave serious covid infections. Sadly everyone ability take day something like booster shot! city‚Äôs 3,646 COVID-19 deaths November 1, 2021, 51.9 percent diabetes 23 percent obese.

It's vague enough qualify. doooo it!   Yes! didn‚Äôt lymph node reaction 1 2 booster? Oh boy sensitive least week. Hey look, sane comment  Wait 8-12 weeks shot 2. Kids don‚Äôt get sick either way covid. trial like 2000 kids 3 vaccinated kids got covid 16 unvaccinated kids got covid, none got sick. said, 100 kids got fevers second dose, high 104. shows folly pointing whatever state/region bad moment saying ""look awful are!"" shaking head Florida talk Delta hit them.  Right? can‚Äôt believe selfishness. easy fill questionnaire people honest lie therefore qualify boosters federal level...even state encouraging universal boosters. complete mess conflicting communications right now.

I aware kind checking fact questionnaire, lot people lie anyone healthcare provider. accounted vaccination status? data could skewed lot (one group could vaccinated people other, leading asymptomatic cases). assume accounted age difference groups. sure.. level minded, yet cautious vax crowd, maybe told going get really sick based body (versus general statistics) could deal maker.

There always resist underlying fear, belief, conspiracy.. there's really helping them.  FWIW valved disposable respirators turn pretty good job source control well wouldn‚Äôt necessarily rule out. comfortable wear especially gym setting warmer you‚Äôre breathing heavily.  Haha, sounds exactly like Czechia disingenuous point contrast levels willingness receive (or kids receive) vaccine. point highlight superior logistics time around, fine. Excellent Right! noticed lol.    saw guy twitter Moderna Phase 1 trials, got booster 8 months ago antibody levels still (the maximum) got tested last, looks like least good Pfizer  say history high blood pressure. can't argue that, even test spot high. got boosted, fine.   ""It‚Äôs significant proportion, majority means.""

This sentence implies Fauci secret set numbers, yet share them. also makes think coming conclusion based anecdotal evidence.

Moderna booster, setup vaccine appointment pharmacy Moderna get Pfizer booster.  state ability override federal regulators. Ditto got immunocompromised 3rd shot. felt crappy second shot overall intense armpit swelling lasted almost 2 weeks, didn‚Äôt happen either previous dose.  3 weeks ago literally advised universal boosters. Anyone half brain saw coming, WTF public health officials doing? realize yet public gets confused, frustrated angry fast policy shifts? calls whole decision making ability question. would crime humanity.   Huh good know, thank you, misinformed  layered quote satire Fascistic propaganda really seems fitting here. people like you.   help  Yes, Pfizer Moderna booster. serious side effects. sore arm, headache, fatigue. You‚Äôre not, help ease person‚Äôs mind. probably worded better like plenty vaccines, we‚Äôre deficit, worst hypothetical you‚Äôre taking dose someone doesn‚Äôt want dose. amount people that‚Äôs actually medically *cannot* vaccinated absolutely tiny.

Everyone 5 vaccinated now. Young children largely mildly effected covid. also aren‚Äôt places like gyms, bars, events, restaurants.

That‚Äôs argument continue stopping limiting world.   parent comments mention anything like that. *unusually* severe adverse effects. someone bad, ask doctor getting booster.

For people, hand, booster really small inconvenience, getting no-brainer. banned multiple rules here?  Maybe.

More likely Europe region **admitting** increasing COVID deaths.  Yeah, even provaccines social media forces onto you. know theres official cdc youtube channel? never bad idea watch scishow videos.

There also highly acclaimed kurzgesagt, recently published book immune system, heres video covid general also well known ted-ed hope help starting point proper youtube videos  something spreads exponentially, 5-11% reduction spread (for exposure) adds fast. prevented infection could 3-6 future ones prevented (Delta R0 ~6).    Gibraltar averaging ~60 cases day dude. Yuppers. Pfizer Moderna booster.  would actually guess opposite. Strong side effects may mean immune system would strong response virus own.

From I've heard, elderly tend much fewer side effects vaccine immune systems weaker. letting burn results variants back square 1. - right way get boosters, get kids vaccinated, keep Rt 1 probably means mask mandates winter season. time frame second third? restrictions aren‚Äôt work school related? least area vaccinated doesn‚Äôt effect anything else.  assumes third dose provide enduring protection likely will. 

Annual boosters almost certainly end sufficient long run. entirely possible even 3-5 year boost cycle may end sufficient 3-4 spread dose schedule, premature say that. 

Those got infected COVID naturally got vaccinated retained abnormally high protection infection. leads believe enduring immunity created vaccines, take couple extra doses spanning extended time windows.  read they‚Äôve contain it? It‚Äôs completely draconian. I‚Äôm part ‚Äúmuh freedom‚Äù crowd, government literally forces people stay covid outbreak, else go straight prison. don‚Äôt know cheer that. companies worked hire someone general discharge.

A general discharge administrative discharge. one going refuse hire someone unless idea means.   vaccines let‚Äôs move fuck on.

There people cannot get vaccinated dunce. Moderna booster got good, too. Fever/chills, headache, joint pain. lasted 2-3 days. second shot gave 5 days worth symptoms.

I figure booster made sick, COVID would put hospital. modern history, vaccine never worse illness itself.    wife got week we're ""qualified"" give fuck. states approved adults get boosters that's good enough me. Sorry CovFlu gonna take off...  Good point. suppose people naive take statements literally. Although put much weight political soundbites and/or slogans used convey easily digestible general message public. Perhaps I'm intelligent informed understand ""stopping"" covid impossible. lot experts I've listened saying long time. seems like common sense.   seems like waste time.  

Two separate shots seem like big deal.

What would really effective finding way integrate vaccine misinformation. way people receive misinformation also receive vaccine. üòâ hope masking planes never ends, certainly will.

I'm hoping students become fully vaccinated, waive requirement unless symptoms. Kinda like NFL does. There's pretty good chance original series + booster provide long term immunity, unless stuck ultra-rapid Delta-style variants need continuous high circulating antibodies, case we'll see.

Your immune system never maintains antibodies. That's works. memory B cells retain coding remake antibodies needed. 
If immune system kept blood full antibodies viruses ever encountered blood would flow like molasses.

I personally would bet boosters actually offering less duration immunity infection, immune system response covid faster efficient. that's also good sense would mean immune system effectively handle covid minimal symptoms, maybe even none.

The key thing immunity illness immunity infection different things.  Could they're accounting number people still considered unvaccinated/unrecovered point either strong innate immune systems actually recovered past undetected. Almost studies screening people based antibodies, nobody looking T-cells markers past exposure/infection. Even comparing current rates infections symptoms ask different populations infected AY.4 AY.4.2 right measuring difference (it could marker AY.4.2 taking transmission displacing AY.4 among younger less vaccinated people likely spread virus right now).

Any news insight littlest kids vaccinated? right correct answer. media always oversimplify issue ‚Äúwaning vaccine protection‚Äù, whereas actual mechanics immune response nuanced that.

high circulating antibodies (recently vaxxed/boosted/recovered) means intruding viruses get stopped right away. Hence highly protective testing positive PCR test.

antibodies naturally decline time, vaccinated people still protected body create new antibodies demand thanks immune memory. said, caveat process isn‚Äôt instantaneous, therefore people vaccinated months ago relatively prone testing positive. doesn‚Äôt mean prone ‚Äúgetting (seriously) sick‚Äù - immune system kicks gear, antibodies produced body fight virus. literally billions people haven‚Äôt even gotten first dose.

As incorrect administration vaccine assume referring fact people administering vaccine may aspirate (meaning pulling needle back order see blood comes not, prevent injecting directly vein). far know aspiration currently part guidelines vaccine administration bit worrying properly figured out, indeed increase risk adverse reactions?

People tend trust experiences making decisions truth Covid millions Americans it, tested positive it, mild symptoms. really bad virus people would lock follow mask vaccine guidelines. 

Let‚Äôs say H5N1 mutates spread like Covid staying deadly, CFR estimated around 15-35%, Americans would 100% respond correctly b/c would bodies piling streets areas hit first. sure. see argument Fauci making statement mainly preventative measure. Waning protection thing see uptick cases needing hospitalization amongst vaccinated. largely result of, opnion, ""im done pandemic"" mentality reaching population.  cant attest solid figure population would wager non zero anecdotal evidence. would guess close zero.

I feel need share world first world countries. also, tend study effort keep educated matter, believe see uptick due general lack usage known good mitigation factors, holidays, general seasonal aspects winter. last year. bubonic plague kept coming back waves thousand years. would wipe huge chunks population time. COVID going relatively quickly gently thanks vaccines, things considered. recently North Dakota, worked over. commonplace people realize wonder statistics updated. highly doubt it, especially given many states reporting proper infection statistics first place. second thoughts matter. skeptical life return soon. Unfortunately, globally, vaccination rates high enough, worm keeps mutating, quite insidious. think years pass we'll see combination vaccinated people, people natural higher immunity pass genes on, etc. could wrong, hope I'm wrong, remain skeptical.    actually 3,000

You're correct, 3,000 total.

The first 1,500 monitored 2 months second dose. FDA requested second group another 1,500 got shot monitored 2 weeks second sampling standpoint plenty

Absolutely true. problem asked ACIP make purely scientific judgement went rails public policy. Nobody taking anything away.

Might quite opposite First needed vaccine, tested needed 2 doses effective. vaccines immunities reduce time. 6 months noticed, need another dose point get back original immunity. basic science, think instead, oh need 3rd dose, can't people knew vaccines requires doses certain amount time?  ""Increasing recorded covid deaths"". Michigan national news peak.

that's... first thing that's ever gone wrong kid doses smaller amount vaccine? Probably vaccine wearing masks. states already approved boosters adults. Check states health department website see.   Yes definitely agree Covid worry kinds long term effects, wanted kids get vaccinated quickly. ""wait see"" person. waited week, saw 1 million kids got shot nothing alarming news, noticed available times area. kid got shot 1 earlier week. rush wait line hours, wanted ensure something worry about.

I'll probably wait 5-6 wks shot 2, instead minimum 3 wks. That's based every single piece data I've read saying better space out. says get 2nd shot 3-6 wks later, I'll still following guidelines.  even close race. someone came back mandatory work fluff team building event. angry, ONE (40+) people wearing masks except hallways &amp; bathrooms. We‚Äôre IL everyone 2 vaxxed wearing masks indoors. 

I‚Äôm venting, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd learned home office outbreak fucking cautious. % kids need vaccinated hit 70% people shots? getting scientific anti-vaxx line thinking  Wearing mask restaurant upsurd imo. work restaurant see people walking masks, take off, dinner leave masks. 

I mean sitting full dining room everyone without mask(for obvious reasons) difference make put 10m walk towards exit? 

Sorry kind rant, people gone absolutely crazy regards covid. Sorry, situations mind-bogglingly silly me.  couldn‚Äôt even get appointment locally tomorrow 3 kids. probably live conservative state.

While unfortunately lead missteps, worst thing COVID far number people intent dying spite.

They're people stand country 115% wrong, suggest something want greater good issue. Airlines going able handle influx travelers. cancellations going massive people pissed. fear getting injured needing emergency care winter. Otherwise deep well compassion closed refuse vaccination.  took kids last night! would gone last week, viral illness (not covid) running house wait everyone recovered. market still running? place beginning end.

COVID, illness vaccine, studies currently field (I'm actually part one). Hope right! tired this. family member doctor believe vaccine.

fuck tough; sorry. I‚Äôm glad province (Ontario, Canada) never instituted curfew. nightly 6km walks lockdown kept absolutely losing sanity. Meanwhile, friends neighboring Quebec locked home 8pm, unless dog, emergency. dog emergency.  vaccine passport free well Seriously, listen people tell daughter tell white lie get shot soon possible. reluctant first, waited bit. cases surging state, open appointments hard come by. Totally this. anti-vaccine neighbor like proud announce sister got covid vaccinated!

I: died?
him: heu no..
I: vaccines work; vaccines energy shields. moderna booster still 40% dose pfizer original shot Bremen: super easy get vaccine anywhere, tons mobile vaccination teams around town events like football matches. everything overcrowded people want booster shot three vaccination centers city fully booked end year. trucks turn people away interest skyrocketed. Maybe right. Maybe science make decision early stick it. adjusting recommendations based new data sign weakness, right? 

We still calculating planetary orbits assumption revolve around Earth. still treat fevers bloodletting trepanation. otherwise would destroy people's faith science! probably set appointment CVS questions asked. Good thing Ebola vaccines insanely effective ;-)

And there‚Äôs ton research coronaviruses happening right now. like think we‚Äôll ready next one. goalposts move again. Hypothetically tiny Nabs wiping ever gets started nothing really gets stimulated. There's point body expend extra effort winning every battle. there's actually infected cells there's nothing displayed antigen-MHC complexes CD4+ helper T-cells get excited about.

But can't control exposure dose around eventually antibodies indeed wane would get infected massive exposure one day, carries risk getting sick turn transmission risk least. better boost vaccines since get actually sick transmit vaccine injection.

This parents teachers still get sick quite lot around little virus factories day long, get flu shots matter age are. brother-in-law told workplace vaccinated believed him. Jokes got Covid, spread around office died. would trust absolutely one without documentation confirming.  know multivalent vaccines would measurably cut breakthrough cases, improve outcomes future variants, simply allow us cut dose size half get result. incredible missed opportunity. are, supposedly, running trials though. probably tipping point everyone switches multivalent, seeing booster guidance.

But stepwise improvement, game-changer like third doses are.  Comparing [50% increased neutralization multivalent [relationship antibody titers suggests they'd cut breakthroughs something like 25%. order risk reduction treatments MABs, merck pill, dexamethasone, maybe even ivermectin. Unlike those, course, would also prevent transmission amount. I‚Äôm Missouri. dashboards last month St. Louis showed 30% Covid patients 2 dose vaccinated. number dropped 26% patients boosters rolling out. previously low case counts stats numbers going up. Generally good data Thursday Veterans Day last week thrown communication it. people checking comorbidities mean us still trying follow damn rules, matter inconvenient is. probably nuanced even. probably easier body stop fairly short viral exposure (ie, passing, maybe 30 minutes restaurant) less viral particles deal longer term exposure (living someone covid / spending day infected person). Even lot antibodies, eventually, they'd saturated viral particles many free floating ones bind constant stream viral particles? Yeah, 3 days really nothing. gonna dead 80 years. MARK WORDS. VACCINE BAD  agree. days really isn‚Äôt much wait actually grand scheme things. It‚Äôs nice thought folks giving shots needed extra practice I‚Äôm pretty sure didn‚Äôt learn first day COVID shots available. flu kill hundreds thousands every year, even restrictions?  feel anything first 2? second one put OOC day. got booster today wondering I‚Äôm gonna feel like ass   literally get vaccinated first. anti-vax, know vaccine works, want possibility miscarrying becoming infertile. 

So waited got pregnant (which happened August), made first trimester, talked LOADS pregnant women promised safe, addition 3 different doctors (my OB rotates us 4 midwives). got first dose Moderna 2 weeks ago 2nd dose early December. 

I still worried chance miscarrying scheduled ultrasound day first dose everything looked great baby, hearing definitely scared shit didn‚Äôt big flashy sudden spike, long slow climb‚Ä¶  think? something public sector typically paying less recruiting best?  ‚ÄúI want mask forever‚Äù worst messaging ever told us get vaccinated stay inside wear mask anyway. alone made millions people want get vaccinated. Also, there's absolutely reason believe midnight curfew significant impact spread.

This kind thing risks becoming counterproductive. Restrictions restrictions sake  can‚Äôt really debunk ethical view lol. it‚Äôs market failure due it‚Äôs negative externalities. Literally micro economics 101. examples comprehensive list.   ""administrative burdens"", course, admin speak ""bring chief LPO putting stupid ass"". hand, model sailors, everyone pretty much baffled happened. 

In one case, guy joint girlfriend's house young stupid (yet promising) sailor; per Old Man put Mast, typed page 7 let see it; left properly scared shitless XO us tear up; show scare guy straight. obviously worked; last time talking old friend, mentioned said seaman recently made Master Chief.

But circle back original convo, they're idiots, OTH them. need whole dog pony show. deal ‚Äòmasks don‚Äôt work / wear mask‚Äô governmental flip flop messaging, entirely new shitshow moving goalposts many vaccines need vaccinated.

Do 30 year olds really need third doses rest world‚Äôs first?  Given found studies, likely unrelated. especially given we've 6-9 months mass rollouts reports causing IBS, getting IBS. fact worried vaccine could also causing IBS.

Related, experienced similar symptoms decade ago, turned sever acid reflux. hits vagus nerve way triggers heart palpitations. experience drinking, eating fattening bad food? ruined life many months able effectively cure it. worry people buying n95s like toilet paper.

Thats said. Well done managing write nuanced thoughtful comment reddit. People get medical exceptions valid reason avoid vaccine. conditions far between, people typically would even worse getting Covid rely everyone else getting vaccinated. Everyone else excuse. Serbia, recommended get every six months.  figured reason... :( No. reduce transmission particles. first hand experience efficacy.  yeah^ ^ ' instagram bombards medieval times conspiracy, claiming get sick one body fluids accumulates. literally impossible watch credible source youtube video without conspiracists overwhelming comments.

-Joe Biden, October 22, 2020 

Also, here‚Äôs one circulating start: ‚ÄúStop Spread‚Äù       Uh. Literally every doctor I've recommends yearly flu shots. Every place I've worked recommended it. One year work even vaccine clinic even though medical educational work.

If recommended flu shot (fancy way saying get it), probably get often.  you‚Äôd rather potentially die 2 days discomfort? How, fuck, losing three days vomiting, diarrhoea, night sweats muscle pain mild inconvenience? removed regular people's reality think that? 'm done trying understand idiots . Sorry sorry .  I'm arguing rules easy follow. explaining followed, even are, leave plenty gaps spread. friend still alive though? reduces chance getting covid, eliminate. biggest protection hospitalized. Man, remember cases going people got vaccinated. unvaccinated mutate virus Delta. said wear mask knew masks appropriate. Instead fauci company lied. easily could millions cloth masks made week.  favorite ‚Äúthere proof vaccines reduce transmission‚Ä¶‚Äù fueled endless amount misinformation anti-vax propaganda we‚Äôll probably never stamp out. changing availability booster too? eligible it. I'm double doses, took care 2 kids it, without mask. point, unless really nasty variant comes up, I'm good I'm rooting China succeed.

Uncontrolled spread Covid \~1.4 billion people increases probability nasty new variant.  Same. got mine night weekend. felt like shit whole weekend. way worse first two.

I'm glad got need be, sickest I've probably 5 years. eat anything day took good days fully get appetite back. I'm definitely getting boosters weekends. broad anyone wants one pretty much get one. questions sign think may need one, that's it. least places like Albertsons. disagree, can. literally everyone get vaccinated. still cases, hospitalizations would much much lower, possibly flu levels. heard much stuff different duration effect 3 month separation vaccines (I remember speculated longer separation would better), also got mixed shots?

My first Astra Zeneca, country decided stop giving men age, second shot got 3 months later Pfizef. good/fucked I, since working mechanisms already pretty different? say second shot easier me, first gave worse side effects. shit . I'm angry every single one politicians . knew vaccination rate sucked . Back July number first vaccinations started go never picked . government anything ? Well , election coming . know would need booster shots since summer . anything make happen ? Yes , closed vaccination centers . shit making way fan suddenly look like surprised pokemon. even can't pick shit ground . CDU back opposition mode suddenly finding things wrong weeks ago FDP (most likely part new government ) wants treat vaccinated unvaccinated people , want vaccine mandate want lockdown . 

It's like gave responsibilities door politician's office . in, flu shot means give life, according dumb idiot Reddit can't deal wrong internet! Government: Get booster bad person.

Me, old immunocomprised: Okay, I'll get booster

Government: No.

The people lied immunocomprised frontline workers get vaccines: Wow bad person get booster. fuck sub? anti-vaxxers trying infiltrate something? knew vaccine magic cure protection ran out.

People acting like go booster jab instead dying ventilator bridge far... like point view gets decide benefit society whole gets mandated? come something mandated hasn‚Äôt found fully effective many times flat inaccurate? (eg. can‚Äôt get covid vaccinated). something mandated order protect community evidence constantly changing? case one‚Äôs vaccine health choices effect health? lastly it‚Äôs obvious things effective mandate order increase health community whole don‚Äôt mandate ton things like fast food smoking would benefit community whole? (excuse fact common examples brought anti-vax pop think add here) Definitely lower risk.

My concern still people kids might still getting exposed.  realize people get flu shot every year right? never last time flu like 15 yrs ago  saying that, bravado always people entirely expecting one ventilator slowly dying.

If unfortunate enough position, last thoughts ""should got booster"".   bad 1989 guess. They're making observations society today, back functional world massively eroded trust institutions. great vaccination rates, least US still.  Anecdotal, wondering one reasons never outbreak workplace, despite working closely person throughout pandemic. creates dust high ceilings excellent air filtration. 

We've one case, employee gone concert. recently everyone vaxx half staff booster. symptoms sent home two week vacation tested negative. Given timing, definitely showed work infected least days. one else got it. everyone test 3 times. 

Masks, filtration, vaccines work. Even can't distance. Masks big deal me. I'm living fear, waiting around 'get life'. still wearing mask though.   Haha.

Of course is.

Papa Pharma wants sweet sweet‚Ä¶

MONEY!!! Logistics bottlenecks. Every single place taking 5-11 slammed. Everyone different people seems, anecdotally, second shot worst side effects third milder. Personally, felt nothing sore/swollen lymph nodes 3rd Pfizer.  Yes definitely case, like every ""THIS LAST ONE"" messaging we've gotten. stop. also sounds irrational uninformed expect different significant minority US population talking about.  God dude took 2 fucking years people realize obvious fucking thing. pro-vax agree here. travel internationally lot I‚Äôve tons extra vaccines (before trip Africa got 3 4 one day travel clinic), I‚Äôve never side effects felt anything covid shot. Even taking malaria pills didn‚Äôt affect all. three covid shots mine pretty mild doable, definitely felt them.

I understand consideration. Climate change nothing compared biodiversity collapse. area pediatrician offering due storage constraints directed people chain pharmacy get kids vaccinated.  Called chain pharmacy told offering kids 12 call pediatrician. 

Luckily local rural hospital hosting kid clinics every weekend since vaccine approved 12 every time roll weekend, packed. It'll slower crawl way, we've options able get almost 7 year old vaccinated first weekend available. sounds irrational uninformed getting medical guidance major news reporting instead doctor CDC. Also driven mental/physical health pollsters dropped 69% thinking good health October 2020 40% now. can't really blame Biden he's old spotlight 2020 compared bozo office time. talks people realize he's clearly there. 

He's president, job navigate issues country faces. previous president spit roasted global pandemic. current one answer global supply chain crunch? worth vote either candidate think they're awful. agree.  I...don't buy this.. Yes two Pfizer got moderna booster text cut entering post saw 5.3 billion 19 antiviral pills  Better vax requirments endless masks. Anything move masks. Even information people still ""take chances"" leave fate get sick die. presume it‚Äôs earlier guidance. Israel already decided boosters, US still holding line breakthroughs generally mild vaccine protected hospitalization strongly. doesn‚Äôt seem like entirely accurate. 

A lot science changes long takes obtain solid clinical evidence it‚Äôs hard blame people feeling like fed information benefits public health policy time rather information benefits individual protection. would personally feel aggressive pushing one shot J&amp;J better example boosters that‚Äôs another time. 


(Of course I‚Äôm saying stop trusting CDC ‚Äúdo research‚Äù, I‚Äôm saying understand frustrating experience medical guidance constantly changing trying figure best protect pandemic)  Wouldn‚Äôt vax issue?

Sry German news source this, news feed small ticker statement little feed.
""Zwei Regionen √ñsterreich m√ºssen Komplettlockdown""(two regions Austria go complete Michigan going uptick speak, glad got booster early November, three Moderna's me. folks go closest pharmacy get booster. mother got 3 Pfizer cousin JJ Moderna, we're fine.   Ok guess need start smoking stay healthy Without even getting study, headline contains pants-on-fire lie - masks ""the best public health measure virus."" Vaccines best public health measure virus.

The study says masks best non-pharmaceutical measure. Already mine scheduled tomorrow preparation holidays. Yea armpit puffy week I'll surprised see 50% age group next 6 months based polling, etc. qualify. go check box saying ‚Äúfrom interpret guidelines qualify?‚Äù

Walmart literally worded like that.

Did walk yesterday wait super easy. Felt like shit night though :( bad second shot didn‚Äôt last long. Thank god Never realized someone could self identify strongly. data presented shows vaccine reduces transmission answer YES. aircraft loses compression, put oxygen mask first helping around you. Walgreens recommended getting one. deviate cause confusion?  vaccine absolutely reduces severity, 100% effective preventing infection spread virus.

Because care silly irrational stance ""masks anti freedom"". actually consider part solution instead part problem.

Vaccine Vaccine, everyone followed MASKING social distancing guidelines day 1, dank pit now. forget stay-at-home military wives. sure address husband's rank! strawman.  Ok vaccinated over-represented intensive care since 90% population vaccinated. Someone correct I'm wrong.

They're ones spreading like wildfire allowing keep mutating surviving. fuck get booster? clear aerosol masks became sure thing, worry people buying n95s like toilet paper.

Doctors supposed lie patients logistical issues. needed institute rations masks something doctors do. brigaders probably chosen thread target. I‚Äôm Pop Star, Doctor! J&amp;j absolutely kicked ass. I‚Äôm sitting waiting booster shot. sleepless night awaiting me‚Ä¶ sigh Probably want get Moderna, number breakthroughs lowest it.

However, side effect likelihood higher. Honestly mom always kept home school sick, stay home sick guys big problem gotcha, ya I‚Äôm curious anecdotal differences peoples experiences try wrap head around may going on, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre good now! thing think know 100% certain virus novel humans it‚Äôs super weird affects people many different ways. Intuition isn‚Äôt even close enough explaining anything virus disease.   I‚Äôm not? go lots places things don‚Äôt require masks. entire existence comprised indoor dining shopping? can‚Äôt get restaurant library pretty much indoor place without proof vaccination.

Did know occurring many places?   extremely unlikely die 2 doses, right thing. Good job! Wait find covid like...

Honestly messaging farther mark. 2 days fever chills worth respirator food eat taste like feces 10 months hey own! lol flu shot 2 years XD  Lmfao rage weirdo. Blindly trusting government sucks way whatever shit he‚Äôs paywall. think better way end hospitalization death would put effort effective medicines treatments force people get vaccine? mean many people actually get yearly flu shot? 

Feel like pigeonholing big brother says required Pharmaceutical companies trusted. controversial statement. Honestly I'm even adult yet covid yet, homeschool I'm worried tbh. I'd understand much older seem worth since 100 deaths 2 million+ state.   work nursing home 41% staff vaccinated. Deadline Dec 4 get first shot. whole bunch people filling religious exemption papers. 
 pissing f off. None actually religious religion vaccine??! actually went online made earlier post checked availability.

If listened guys, we'd inside next 60 months least cure anxiety.   Never heard them. Certainly mainstream claim.  San Diegan checking in. Depends area you‚Äôre San Diego. Lots restaurants stayed open weren‚Äôt supposed to, lots people pretty cavalier approach covid. Wishing lived somewhere like Seattle NYC right now, actually take seriously. Also loving NYC‚Äôs vaccine mandates bars restaurants. expected it, people want lock down, wear masks, get vaccinated, etc.

I might vaccinated one strain, might even catch one straight vaccinated super good go, that's going stop bunch degenerates spreading covid around, mutating it, getting back new form ready fuck life up.

Sadly they'll people thread acting like doomsday always say coming that's never got first place that, getting vaccines somehow detrimental us. Fucking morons.

I assume we'll lots boosters even effective vaccines future. fine. absolute idiot think problem. go! single \ #

\#foo Anti-vaxx level nonsense. Chill thanos. I'd say reddit supporting covid vaccines quite bit compared social medias. Seems like may change future.   think correct medical term *super duper vaccinated* We're entering Covid round 4 now, there's COVID bonus round plus spring. Maybe there's Covid round 5, still largely avoidable point time. late. Bidens original goal 9/20 really best date. caused massive confusion suppressed number people got boosters.  one seriously thinks initial booster decision based data. mess ACIP think people truly limited means largely stayed due eviction moratorium.

I think people permanently left likely middle/upper middle classes. boom suburban real estate think people trying life long terms residents Catskills Hudson Valley. lot people semi-struggle get NYC despite solid incomes, particularly kids. NYC public school enrollment 5% year would guess many people moved 20-100 miles away.  ""I went Afghanistan totally fine know one"" acceptable thing say, politically incorrect rude.

I hope kind comments get kind treatment road. Take responsibility act public forum know easy. getting vaccinated definitely going stop virus. Well yeah, like lonelysidechick mentioned, exactly wallet-sized. could easily made size regular health auto insurance card.

Also, need card, States certification good enough literally every time I've needed verify vaccine don‚Äôt think anybody mind people freely choose wear masks, right? expect see people wearing masks rest life. wish could choose wear mine. got J&amp;J six months ago. got booster week ago. cdc recommend people received J&amp;J get booster 2 months. wish would open 16 yr olds. teen Texas- mask vax state. Agreed, know exactly perfectly deal completely new deadly virus quickly spread across world perfect messaging data need updates new information discovered.

Sarcasm tell. way _your_ doctor, _you_ patient supposed lie you. Yes, nasal spray vaccines raise mucosal immunity work better prevent infection. fear time one approved, us would already infected. article UK, needs happen US going prevent winter surge. may late. CDC slow recognize 3-dose vaccines rank slow asymptomatic spread transmission airborne rather droplet, biggest mistakes pandemic.

""Fully vaccinated"" mean sounds like rather regulatory term. prevent transmission takes 3 doses fully vaccinated. news double vaxxed astrazenica ? lot people live midwest. prairie west mountain west lightly populated.

The great lakes part midwest includes 5th (PA), 6th (IL), 7th (OH), 10th (MI) populated states. great lakes midwest (great lakes states minus NY) ~66m people. Add primary non-lake midwestern state Iowa hit ~69m. big land area midwest super dense, definitely lot people.

That west coast CA+WA+OR (~51m) plus nearby neighbors AZ+NV (+~10m) Pacific states HI+AK (+~2m) total ~64m (numbers slightly due rounding). 

It's prairie mountain west low populated.  Nah, think Bill Gates wants kill 6 billion people. guy internet showed 30 second Youtube clip! one? still understand US use system France QR code, available either paper in-app, checks government database.

It's fool proof, much better. possible get reinfected, yes, chances dramatically lower. That's US south low case rates right -- nearly everyone got infected last wave. Can't afford anything else I'm afraid. lump.... That‚Äôs point. don‚Äôt exist.

You don‚Äôt even realize proved example worthless. Cheers. investment advice?  I‚Äôm booked AZ booster next weekend. Easy sort NHS website day boosters announced earlier month.   Same. tested positive felt fine. vaccines fucked hard though. Still taking third one believe science, I‚Äôm honestly scared lol single J&amp;J + Pfizer booster count?  Sigh, troublesome thing. Guess I'll need relegate salary future event possible annual shots. Sucks third world ahaha. 

I hope integrate Flu shots atleast win. true. nation decided want information monetized incentive good reporting except, maybe, outlets cater niche market educated consumers. know fact idiots surprised lol  here, sticking Moderna. Got booster Sunday 5pm. Slept ok. Woke mild muscle, joint body aches. Intensified noon around level 2nd dose. Fever got 100.8 mid afternoon. Took Tylenol, felt better bit, took another Tylenol bed. Slept good, woke next day right rain. üíâüíâüíâ remember conspiracy say this.  actual religion. Religion according first amendment ""sincerely held belief"". prevent state choosing religions valid arent exactly know cloth masks appropriate? Make sure factor things like additional face-touching cause. hunch masks might appropriate, really know whether dealing droplets aerosols, *did* know face touching hand-hygiene problematic. *do* know cloth mask's main effect prevent others getting infected. look statements CDC, sayiing early February peopel wear masks feeling sick. point realise long asymptomatic infectivity went - thought likely like SARS-Cov-1, flu bird flu. 

Bottom line - ""Lie"" misleading unfair say was. people struggling balance multiple factors difficult circumstances. doubt would done better time.  Thank you.

Some people may move back, may find can't get money suburban house bought bidding war apartments houses city get much cheaper, any. understanding rent particular rebounded bunch people signed leases reduced rates hit huge increases can't afford, come surprise. 

There burst apartments changing hands situation improved earlier year, mostly compressed activity due market dead long, exodus. Every apartment sold purchased someone market basically back normal. known people moved Catskills housing dirt cheap compared here. think many underestimated cost money time commuting city buses leave early morning get back home evening. know many people particular move pandemic heard read anything it.    comparatively new disease ' making shit go' basically learning changing/adding opinion best public health   Funny happening places, Missouri I'm still eligible get booster want it.  And? vaccines need take lot times, new, instead, get vaccinated die it?  feel exactly like do, many others.  guy, dealt daily IBS bouts gastritis 2 years.

Low-FODMAP diet offer temporary relief, combine gradually re-introducing foods identify trigger diets. Low-FODMAP long term solution, helpful gets bad can't eat anything without pain.

Working GI slow process, produce results.

Eating smaller meals throughout day. eating late night. Minimize caffeine alcohol. Minimize stress. Walk daily. Drink LOT water.

Can also look probiotics.   clue. Sorry dude. :( flu much less infectious. going doctor money time young person way better even 20s 30s issues. üòî actually check background database see shots before?

Absolutely not. Pretty much anyone wants booster get one. definition ""high risk"" due health condition occupational situation deliberately broad something verified. know people even forgot vaccine card, person giving shot wanted know first dose long ago was. care anything else. SARS coronavirus. responding OP's claim coronavirus immunity gone couple years. aren‚Äôt new. We‚Äôve nasal spray influenza vaccines around decade, think? usual time line vaccine approval well year. It‚Äôs Covid vaccine companies well regulatory authorities funding agencies came together approve vaccine remarkably short time. nasal spray companies (or academic institutions) don‚Äôt kind clout far behind begin with. 

Nasal vaccines also need live viruses capable infecting nasal epithelial cells (although maybe there‚Äôs new breakthroughs). makes development approval slower. flu nasal vaccine live attenuated flu virus. don‚Äôt think people would comfortable snorting live attenuated Covid virus, what‚Äôs risk reversion mutation, example? People looking whether AstraZeneca vaccine given intranasally though, since that‚Äôs live virus.

He tried argue assured him, think masks necessary healthcare staff currently stop shortage, eventually come ask public mask up. kept telling no, guess dissuade buying masks??? 

(spoiler: wasn‚Äôt planning it)

I trying small talk eye doctor thought start hoarding. man, live reality think critically. believe masks necessary public also worried enough endanger supply chain. Don‚Äôt treat like idiot.  FWIW, saw post popular epidemiology page FB (called Dear Pandemic) covered fact families 11 year olds getting kids shots ‚Äòno questions asked‚Äô pharmacies. One reason said that, chance child would adverse reaction shot need medical attention, insurance could easily refuse cover it.    need hire guys make Kurzgesagt make messaging country. stuff easy understand without talking you. 

Or maybe guys made DNA cartoon Jurassic Park. people mostly likely anti vaxxers even take single vaccine  Bro happened India even vaccine. I‚Äôm central IL it‚Äôs exact same.

Yeah, same... back days using goods medicine offer. changed mother got sick doctors pretty much fucked even prescribing shit ton antibiotics. question everything docs say visit doctors completely necessary, time trying take care health own. would presume much health comm team hampered previous administration, even allowed keep jobs.  Anti vaxxers idea vaccines work. Lots vaccines requires 2 doses, suprising unexpected people know medical science works.  Covenza? long ago?   make 93% population. previous messaging lie, least US.

Information virus severity actively warped political purposes highest levels government.  think everyone get boosted. Everyone. buy claims article, specifically. unreasonable layperson know p-value is; honest, three thousand people sound like would statistically significant someone without understanding statistics works.

Agree 100% problem lot folks can't expected understand stuff acting though know better people do... getting people killed.  vaccination rates tell whole story. fully vaxed May booster yet, elevated risk. also could become spreader initial vaccine shots effectiveness wane. Soon fully vaccinated going mean 3 shots. science public policy, frequently say ""we absolutely definitive data, based long pattern similar situation, believe right course IIRC, actually said was, ""at time feel boosters necessary""

This really true. Many folks thought 3/4 week interval low, we'd always need something 6-12 months, case EVERY vaccine DTAP, MMR, virus sets pace here, researchers scientists best can.

Ludicrous. know diseases vaccines interact. number non-boosted vaccines provide long-term protection zero. Almost every vaccine requires boosting durable protection. COVID special. behaving like every virus vaccinate against. wear masks primarily people.
