Pretty awesome. People going pubs month ago. opened two weeks ago. dentist staff always worn masks, pandemic not. realize necessarily done offices, wtf not? literally gaping mouth usually least hour. case country Bahrain, get booster shot Pfizer already took two shots Sinopharm. that’s actually relevant me, got 3rd dose booster today, Delta variant spreading like wildfire week ago. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

But shouldn’t “iTs GoD’s iNtENtiOn”... surprised hear work retail rural area. workplace higher rate vaccination area whole. asked questions said know!! Lol. Yeah think fear based. It’s interesting sure, absolutely everyone know wants get vaccine ASAP. (I’m 34) Gavin needs take look around rest country. vaccines incredible. Reopening leading spikes cases. Yes. 3/30 terrible ratio. heck kinda work doing? That's illogical. Even fewer people vaccinated month ago, yet virus cases falling.

This delta variant taking hold. It’s true say, Pfizer increase deliveries 70% EU week, probably get nice increase. hate bring insanely valid point people going wind calling racist for. absolutely correct though; look NYC zip code areas least amount black residents far highest vaccinated percentage wise. weird phenomena.

Turns Chinese Sinopharm vaccine isn’t efficient delta variant. started giving Pfizer booster shits co-morbidites, 50years, immunodeficient prople health care workers! got mine today. 

Source: [Washington Post Post I've yet see actual incriminating email something worth getting worked about.

If anyone wants point something relevant I'd love see it.

I've seen 2 things.

1. said mask protect person wearing much protect others (common knowledge since forever....)

2. Someone sent email think virus might created. sure means anything all.  Nice Western Powers around pace relatively

US 299.1 Millions First doses given.(+ 25 Millions doses released month foreign Countries).

EU 261,8 Millions First Doses given(with 300 millions doses already exported worldwide top + 100 millions month given Italy, France Germany). Yeah, big thing NYC really abundance appointments end March even open everyone another weeks since many elderly immunocompromised needed first. I'm religious anymore grew fundamentalist church.

Jesus two commandments order: love god love neighbor: Mark 12:30-31

I see everything power help protect community getting sick count are. Maybe install ventilation system good filter always fresh air.   problem New York lot rural areas vaccine lot whackadoo people NYC get either religious reasons general skepticism. said NYC ton 70%+ vaccinated zip codes already I'm glad live one. Good. live central Florida, county got 50% fast going 1% week now. gotten 60% last time checked May walk Golden Path doing, prepare humanity coming Machines. old tired nonsense. pandemic expect people positive it? I’m NYC (Brooklyn) still see lot masks even outside.

But bars restaurants, it’s over. good news basically flattening curve, place like MS 35% vaccinated, another 30% roughly immune covid before, still positive cases God forbid outbreaks, statistically relatively minor aside analogy, traveling someone unbuckled vehicle, regardless driving, posses significant danger everyone car. event violent collision, rollover, person becomes 100+ pound projectile appendages. also reason leave shit want thrown head laying around seats floor vehicle. Secure inside something trunk, make passengers buckle. called Delta variant, yes. May sound callous I'm pretty ok it. vaccine awhile, avoided political reasons fucks then....that's consequences decision. Deal it. homeless vaccinated? USA update first dose shots:

Seeing little bit rebound numbers. Hopefully weekend stay good holiday weekend past us. Hell yeah, I’m proud say state one 70%. virus makes there, it’s conducive spreading throughout town. Jordan meme India face: took personally. fluff article, capture event all. watch video see.

they pulled numbers Vax Lottery winners, cheerleading good work Californians, took questions.

first question pandemic, Newsom's wife's business. 

when questions finally got covid regulations place, reporters kept hammering away on, ""but really going lift everything June 15?"" kept answering, we'll follow data.

huge miss press, could used opportunity help advance getting many people vaxxed possible kept trying gotcha him.

hot news tip - recall fail, money wasted election. Old people probably still remember bad pre-vaccine era. Measles vaccinations widely available since 1960s, rubella since 1970s. probably also remember Polio epidemic. uptake younger people interesting. say I've supportive guidelines mask mandates. think helpful wise. going back June 15th seems wrong. see saying name caution, frankly June 15 already cautious date. California kicking COVID's ass well month. economy gearing date public health indicators pointed fine date indeed. throw wrench? Nope lol made restaurants pay open patios shut week later Iowa same. Mark words. idiot always idiot. support Exactly. We're talking Tuskegee study here. We're talking vaccinating vulnerable populations country (those Dementia/Alzheimer's/severely reduced capacity group homes). I'd argue would immoral let die cannot make informed consent. ANMC Providence Anchorage level 2 trauma centers, yeah, closest level 1 Seattle Claim: author article bad writer fucks uncle.

Our verdict: FALSE. author bad writer, don’t fuck uncle. could happen literally anywhere virus Yeah think % people vaccinated state always useful stat, vaccinated usually hanging out, without masks, non-vaccinated people. could see big outbreaks covid happening *years* Alaska rest country county that? I’ve seen Placer, El Dorado, Sacramento county current regulations ignored part everything open. I’d surprised see rural parts state stricter. Dumb states vs smart states. on!  daily average still running 2x 4x states. wonder want stop releasing daily data. Like said unfair FL residents. Michigan's cases dropped significantly we're excellent right now. complete 180 2 months ago. nearest trauma care center sent Alaska is... Harbor View. Seattle.  One, assumption much conclusion I've reached based upon scientists saying. clearly posted source informs belief.

Two, trust scientists trust intelligence community. 

Three, virus emerging October incompatible scientists Wuhan getting sick November? wonder ill effects be? perfect scenario superbugs breed....? I'm alaskan definitely hesitation. vaccination sites across state, bush flew vaccines subsistence villages individually. vaccine sites across state. 99% people opportunity get vaccinated wanted.

We're hotbed special brand crazies. Florida reporting cases deaths per week (Fridays) think it’s time states same?  Oh makes sense. know looked like snowing breathe went away could again. need kids again

And kids vaccinated kids November, possibly October.  till kids outdoors, thank God, without serious chance harm.

Indoors, need responsible grownups responsible rules mitigate harm time. sucks, myocardial inflammation scarring heart lungs. 204 hospitalized, none died. Jan Mar 31.  One great tragedies pandemic little responsibility officials, elected otherwise, willing take making lifesaving yet mildly inconvenient decisions.  

There grownups room.  employment law, health care choices. reason think vaccines reasonable it’s literally already addressed, back original statement working hospital without flu vaccine. think abortion statement outlandish I’ve stated it’s already protected current law. really don’t look “business need” “legal precedent” find headed. 

I’m sure sort dystopian world you’re imagining hospital workers held forced vaccinated, really talking whether employer wants continue work relationship individual doesn’t want conform company policy. Maybe they’ll win lawsuit good standing rights, long CDC says vaccine doesn’t cause undo risk, judge agrees sentiment, probably isn’t new line gets drawn.

If you’ve got say I’ll respect read think I’ve said think reasonable topic. good one. think highly situational. Keeping ICU beds critical levels periods peak infection? Yeah, force masking.

Total 82 hospitalized COVID patients (that's case entire state CT): ditch masks ""unvaccinated folks"" risk damn lives. concern anymore.

So, example, young kids continue masked public places eligible received vaccine. that, unless schools require masks, they'll free exist without them. Hmm low vaccinated states something common. Can't quite put finger it. Maybe something party controls state government. stopped testing, anything report. \*Taps forehead\*

Until pandemic declared control (at least state), populace absolute right know daily numbers. EU already exported beyond 300 millions doses 100 Millions month. wearing N95s hours since pandemic started. Still gotten used them. Umm, would suck one immuno-compromised guy can't get vaccinated. Imagine resentment. give away beer trucks guns! Dude, can’t summarize reasons isn’t good time Florida less transparent right now. Right wrong, that’s looks. Fucking Idaho. dumbasses here. 😫 hope encouraged US. got J&amp;J would love receive Pfizer Moderna shot. No. shouldn’t. Meanwhile, NY suddenly decided unvaccinated kids need wear masks indoor classrooms anymore rest school year. can't figure that's good idea. USA 5th leaderboard countries new cases #1 active cases restrain one swore it’s fake. mask mandates lifted healthy, vaxxed people, things arent open. Northern California county numbers move Orange yellow week refuse according Newsom’s emergency declaration, counties enact stricter regulations way around. Indoor dining still 50% kids still person 3 hours daily. 

In county east, indoor dining 25% bars still can’t open indoor customers. 

California far open Newsom’s press conference today worries he’s going keep stranglehold he’s got state. need two hands IM injection doubt they’d let pull pants inject butt VACCINE PASSPORT!

**A VACCINE PASSPORT!**

**AAAAAAAAAAH!** 70% keeps getting away  I’m completely flabbergasted choice. Everything suggested makes complete sense, instead state decided reason, notice, Friday evening new policies take effect Monday morning two weeks school? can’t fathom thought good plan. assume places, biases?

It could California, know. Lassen County, California 19.8% residents fully vaccinated. Kings 22.5%. Tehama 23.4%. Yuba 25.9%. Mariposa 26.0%. Merced 26.1%. NY ready raw dogging. Right? Always inconsiderate...  It’s pretty telling state general highest combination cases positivity rates (every state either high positivity low absolute case numbers high case numbers low positivity, less) first state stop reporting. scope pandemic Florida basically always impossible track even harder. Lmao shut  would less death Hillary charge. doubt mind . Two weeks! bananas. district still doesn’t guidance whether happening Monday, local antivaxxer contingent already settled storming kids unmasked regardless do. People kid’s kindergarten class already pulling kids back full remote. came nowhere Friday evening one knows do. thought good idea? Merrie olde england little bit both. Always find strange want come single reason something happens reality nearly always combination different factors(opening up, less vaccine efficiency, younger folk vaccinated, increased transmission Delta variant)  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Congrats vaccinated protected :) 3 times week 😆 forgot ""Cancel Culture"".    know numbers low, vaccination rate, many counties, also low. think guidelines fine camps come fall, it’s nuts change things drastically two weeks end school notice. Like…on Monday, kids unmasked, many kids still asked parents wear them. Even given kids *waaay* better adults masking, teachers deal figuring kids allowed unmask, kids wear them, policing resume full-remote lessons kids whose parents pulling again. timing baffling. statistic mangled. around 20.6 million 37.6 million people Africa AIDS (that's nonsense, people country South Africa, let alone entire continent). Instead, opposite true; around 23.8 million 34 million people AIDS live come Biden power, rhetoric literally exact shit Trump pulled, suddenly okay?  We've never seen spread [this before.  Also good reason figure ensure unvaccinated mask lower spread chances mutation. read it. still disagree think makes sense. run elimination strategy tough.

Compare Asian nations South Korea Singapore used let contact tracing handle it.

Still South Korea ton cases. Us population: 328 million


Eu population: 448 million planning vacation California fall...

Oh well! 🤷🏻‍♂️ Guess I’ll vacation somewhere South like everybody else doing.

These perma-lockdowners learn lesson eventually. province program register doses received province? might able get digital proof. I'm wondering, needed level 1 trauma center would actually taken Seattle Canada? Read please, comment. explained clearly assumptions. worst part one dose strategy. People think they're immune virus they're really not. agree surplus less, fewer people vaccinated...  Paweł Walewski 


 
Ido question results research published reputable journal ""Nature"" BioRxiv portal, although first conducted fairly small sample (77 people), second presented form so-called preprint, i.e. yet reviewed verified.

 
It worth remembering, however, individual immunity case many viral infections - influenza, SARS caused common rhinoviruses coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2 first one learned) - many variables decide, careful drawing universal conclusions. enough new, specific variant germ emerge become infected again. recurrent infections due variability microbes immune system cannot respond quickly, strength immune response itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also read: tablet covid shout? Pfizer blazes trail Long-term durability. unsupported hypothesis? 

&amp;#x200B;

According study published researchers Washington University St. Louis pages journal ""Nature"", immune cells retain so-called virus memory, persist bone marrow long time produce antibodies needed. plasmocytes, arise result stimulation B lymphocytes, capable producing antibodies. Americans detected people even seven eight months infection ended. turn, study conducted Rockefeller University New York, presented BioRxiv website, showed cells responsible immune memory, i.e. cells, mature strengthen least six months first covid infection.

&amp;#x200B;

Although so-called neutralizing antibodies decline time, immune cells provide permanent protection event germ already know enters body. Read also: mRNA vaccines effective Indian variant cases, conclusions similar - resistance SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus short-lived lasts many months. addition, vaccinations extend it, comforting additional incentive hesitate immunize. New York Times, Dr. Scott Hensley, immunologist University Pennsylvania, commented natural immunity produced survivors infection vaccination ""seems long-lasting."" mean people recovered covid took vaccine need booster doses increasingly talked context fall next season? Many already come conclusion, perhaps little prematurely. 

&amp;#x200B;

In case, hypothesis necessarily hold true everyone. group people - unfortunately difficult estimate numerous - which, covid, elicit strong immune response vaccination. Perhaps, protect risk contracting covid successive waves growth number infections, people need vaccinated again. 

&amp;#x200B;

The flu analogy obvious. surprised time possible immunize viruses one time, multi-component vaccines protect children several infectious diseases today. Read also: Novavax protein vaccine soon Europe Versatile guardians immunity According authors studies, immune memory B cells, produced response SARS-CoV-2 infection, boosted vaccinations, become exemplary prepared case re-infection germ. even various variants. 

&amp;#x200B;

The question scientists make optimistic conclusions today able predict behavior coronavirus near future? sure set antibodies protecting prove effective variants may emerge time? immune memory acquired disease one acquired vaccination organized slightly differently. fighting live virus different responding single virus protein introduced vaccine. addition, worth remembering B lymphocytes produce antibodies variety enemy-antigens, lymphocytes receive signals body's tissues, thanks distinguish infected cells healthy ones. 

&amp;#x200B;

It educated become memory cells, stay body many years case recurring pathogens. sit lymph nodes wait germs attack again. aforementioned American research, also know coronavirus-specific immune cells survive bone marrow acute infection subsided, constantly secretes low levels antibodies. healthy organism, i.e. full response immune system, memory cells defense division responsible production neutralizing antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgA) activated. 

&amp;#x200B;

But practice, people defend strongly infections antibodies alone, lymphocytes, others antibodies, cellular response strong enough eliminate infection. Also read: still possible get infected vaccination? Much depends age. virus make things even confusing: differences immune response according age. Older people produce less less naive lymphocytes, i.e. cells capable recognizing reacting new antigens previously unknown body. Fortunately, still immune memory cells predominate among cells elderly, acquired immune system respond reasonably well antigens germs already knows. 

&amp;#x200B;

Over years, proportions individual elements immune system also change: percentage memory cells naive lymphocytes increases, well cells inhibit immune response, so-called regulatory lymphocytes, finally, number proportion B-cells blood produce antibodies reduced. Depending many variables (age, efficiency immune system, new variants germs) difficult predict resistance covid develop individual cases. dealing germ linked ability infect upper respiratory tract, similar viruses cause classic colds, deadly traits exhibited SARS MERS coronaviruses.

So guarantee immunity disease two-dose one-time vaccination strong enough protect everyone years, especially SARS-CoV-2 returns form various variants may always, least partially, bypass body's defenses. . - context emergence new mutations - additional vaccinations may inevitable, although voluntary basis, want use probably use them. flu vaccination.

I've worked many places give discounts non smoker healthy shape, take biometrics blood tests prove it. They're labeled ""discounts"" come really know really charging more. dual American/Canadian citizen currently living Canada say heck yeah, send we’ll reward big time, NH! haven’t able go store almost three months Ontario, we’ll stampede North Conway borders open. ;) people vaccinated least one dose: population vaccinated least one dose: 44.59 That's one study even peer reviewed published yet also found **lower T-cell levels** waited 12 weeks. fascinating watch east west coast react differently similar ways.

The West Coast become overprotective they're ignoring science now, flat bizarre. happened 69.420% forecast? Canada delaying second doses, it’s actually really important us know effective single dose act accordingly. Lots countries boat.

I feel like many people Canada think invincible getting first dose reopening plans consider first doses. understanding around 33% effective variant. first doses seem much terms cutting transmission comes variant. Mutations don’t matter unless functional mutations. clearly didn’t read damn thing wrote assumptions, pretend natural immunity doesn’t exist equation fucking stupid. Discussion origin clearly allowed unless debunk lab-leak theory. 5% vaccinated people catch covid, literally number comes I'm still reeling fact food service wearing masks... could huge factor flu viral spreads.  Lmao! DeSantis moron. shows corrupt is. replying u/DanoPinyon ""He recalled. get hopes up."" Hit wrong button probably mobile earlier. UK variant : Daegu, Busan, Gyeongnam... (South East Area )

Indian variant : Seoul, Gyeonggi, ... (Greater Seoul Area) I’m sure they’ve studied one dose Pfizer two Sinopharm. Better cautious, course, maybe it’ll protect way better single shot previous shots. Since there’s 1.3 Billion people Africa fact incomplete flat wrong Didn’t Cuomo mandate students attend SUNY schools vaccine fall? Isn’t hypocritical different standards similar subgroups? leaving state emergency place still power. alarming. Everything allowed open doofus politically inept. whole lottery thing looked like skit SNL. Like American Psycho hosted Price Right. He's total narcissist. Based [Singapore's airport [according Pfizer's they're 75% effective (so less 95% still effective, roughly [same level effectiveness Pfizer SA fully vaccinated people too! demand recount. It’s insane people still won’t take it. vaccine literally free. FREE. It’s like sample Costco. Don’t like it? cares? It’s free. 

Imagine excited free stuff yet turning something free lol Thats good :) read 45-90% people asymptomatic ceased care cdc said well.

Cruise ships prisons admit there's incredibly vague inconsistent guidelines comes schools. vaccinated kids mask school, restaurant retail jobs school? makes unique?

Why massive summer camps allowed let everyone unmask outside regardless vaccination status, kids recess playing non contact sports- vaccinated not?

States like rest us see add up.   China significant technical capability prior research would far ahead began researching vaccine. 

&amp;#x200B;

The timeline feel right me.  need headlines. CNN wants talk pandemic certain someone feel drives ratings. fading sunset resorted taking Covid completely context. Another thing like point percentage new diagnosed covid cases rising among teens children. course is! many people 45 vaccinated, kids make huge part unvaccinated pie.

Cases kids still plummeting parents teachers vaccinated spreading them. lesson mislead cherry picking statistics.  fully vaccinated people. else gonna extra gas panic-bought? Username check out. Upstate NY? Rural Ohio? Midwest? Easily healthiest year memory.

Same except constant Uber eats alcohol. Oh, mistake, looking total population numbers.

Honestly, probably combination logistics hesitancy. lot people Alaska Nunavut, probably lot conservative folks feel threat isolated are. “This virus hasn’t extinguished”

“We’re mindful variants”

Jesus Christ, he’s literally sold perma-lockdown people Twitter. He’s parroting talking points. It’s never going “extinguished” VACCINES STRONGLY PROTECT KNOWN VARIANTS.

These people dumb, oh God. Every bit dumb anti-maskers anti-lockdown people 2020. damage cause society unforgivable. That's need get every healthy person vaccinated protect people immune system. TikTok

Doesn't pretty much tell everything need know? looking city (which teetering onwards 70%) noticed people 20-35 among least vaccinated. Seattle too. fuck college graduates getting vaccinated? missing here?... Australia driver gets fined loses points licence passenger wearing seat belt. thing happened Louisiana. one earliest states get vaccines Republicans refusing it. basically 70% state numbers check out. 

It sucks kid 12 right now. can't take anywhere mask mandates longer place 30% population vaccinated. know going take convince people get point aside Donald Trump making speech people patriotic duty get vaccinated. ya know, there's almost zero shot ever happening. New York's numbers quite low. Plus, they're asking schools able match summer camp guidelines. Let see, something new happens. don’t know much it, made decisions based knew. New evidence come in, know more. updated need done 

This science work. It’s cheating keeps updating based new evidence.

On hand, politician promotes false science pandering base.

Worse, refuses adapt new information recommendations. Surprised New York isn’t yet given covid history variants showing up? forget switch accounts replying yourself? What... a... surprise... Good hear!! family would like visit soon. \*sigh\* unzip... Wait, really 10 million without aids Africa? know people got multible times, even get fully vaccinated still get pass on, wont destroy body way without vaccine.  herd immunity works... herd. 

People outside herd, vaccinate, get indirect help herd overall lower infection rate direct help proportional many contacts vaccinated. 

Yes, Covid continue finds pockets people vaccinated.  says already releasing weekly reports long-term care instead daily reports, switching weekly reports everything.

It says article: “The state already stopped producing daily updates COVID-19 infection rates among staff residents long-term care facilities. daily reports, listed names facilities infections, replaced less-detailed weekly reports.”

Also article: ""The change immediate: COVID-19 case vaccine reporting available weekly basis floridahealthcovid19.gov every Friday."" person know full ""certain"" removed.

Well, bet would bet £5.

So there, might still sense them.

Gave 2 months happen. 

Pffffff Also remember, 2021 I'm vaccinated, however phone microchip thing false equivalency. stop using phone whenever want to, never even get one first place. probably explain use word “novel” person start telling everyone books true enemy need burned.  also added immune covid since May 16 think caught twice since then, time 24 hours.  real hard time believing NJ 70% unless surrounded idiots. immediate family 10, one vaccinated. person know got work hospital choice. Everyone else know interest getting it.


Reasons range fully tested, prevent covid-19, one person keeps referring Legend thinking turning zombie lol. Cite peer reviewed published paper examined impacts menstrual cycles. Good. Fcuk* 'em. Hope catch dei like ignornat fcuks are.

No I'm sorry saying - we've warned backward azs retrads year now. Fcuk 'em.

Notice purposefully misspelled items get point across.      Also less half Oregonians. regional thing. states 70%? highest see 50's. Well speak us I'm British Portugal (haven't left house year haha) would 100% wearing mask, sir. Covid magic. there's virus there's chance catching it. That's awesome!  Italy obliged hospital medical employees (doctors nurses) get vaccinated prepared fired: it’s name superior public health constitutional rules, put simply, name “individual rights”: meaning one forced get tue vaccine lawfully fired work front line hospitals unwilling get one.
Covid-19 can’t beaten don’t fully vaccinated hospital workers. That's bullshit, got strain immune long long time, what's really happening influenza mutates fast, get new strains every year. Take look many people getting jab, slow uptake Covid-19 vaccinations here. people made appointments walking could choose Pfizer (supposed age 18 - 49 age bracket) AstraZenica (for 50 over) Staff would throw otherwise used.  ""cure"" virus still there. very, good treatment HIV AIDS. possible many people live happy, healthy life taking certain medications. know details medicines much costs, definitely something manage. Especially catch early.

Get STD tests people! lot harder CCP kept evidence victims scientists' hands. think majority people actually feeling proud safe vaccinated status. make pay fucking tests. adult body juvenile mind. Dude, I'm America. saw news numbers active cases via Worldometer *surprise,* really low. pre-vaccine timeline. vaccine available everyone earlier, would've got true win defeating covid right now. Aside complete lack social-distancing (both Travellers Staff Airports - board Aircraft completely different unavoidable know), let say this.

I've flown twice past 5 weeks, I've seen people wearing masks either completely loose around face, nose chin, all.

And ONE stopped authorities, arrested fined, expelled Airport.

One passenger flight Townsville even stood inside Gate Terminal wearing face mask all, Airline Crew LET BOARD REGARDLESS fly Townsville WEARING facemask whatsoever.

Then, let's look Cabin Safety Demonstration: One Airline Crew give demonstration WITHOUT WEARING FACE MASK ""so show passengers properly apply oxygen mask"" (probably passengers boarded Aircraft already well infected Covid-19 already suddenly trouble breathing flight NEED it... Yeah, screen anybody anymore, they? Covid-19 Dog, Covid-19 Breath Test, etc...? NONE).

Then, demonstration message passengers Federal requirement wear face mask times travelling onboard... Right announce ""In minutes, Cabin Crew serve in-flight snacks drinks"".

SERIOUSLY.

I talk people International flights Australia get ""mistakenly"" waved area they're supposed in, huh?

So, tell exactly likely...

As face masks... practically year half Pandemic. People know apply wear properly, used wearing properly now.

It takes less time toilet train dog.   think tracing happens florida haha, add count something desantis would.never do.

Stop wasting time don’t care , never yes numbers much higher India gave specific examples numbers dont match guess don’t tell vaccines they’ve already aren’t 100%. I'm pretty sure hospitals can't require they're still emergency use authorization (so can't make requirement employment), likely change vaccine fully approved FDA. 

Still can't believe people work hospitals get everything they've seen. even know anyone who's died signed soon could. Good signs, hopefully holds 13th. virus running amok India bad everyone. Headlines state folks regions low vaccine rates ""sitting ducks."" federal government national database vaccinated individuals since distribution responsibility individual states. 

If EU organize travel certificate sovereign nation states, US able non-sovereign federal states, political quite frankly EU's problem.

But Delta? worse Iota? virulent Nu? place Gamma? Nobody knows, people alphabet soup. might well use scientific names.

The window dressing worried racists. Well news flash: racists continue racists finding rationales marginalise even attack others. Making public health discourse difficult zero impact.

Of course, politics rather public health since start. Remember ""no evidence human human transmission"" Jan 14? week earlier, CCP already officially recognised epidemic. Remember would even recognise existence Taiwan? abandoned whole country fate. credibility whatsoever. might impending doom talking about. Going July wedding (full party vaccinated). travel requirement test even vaccinated annoying, that’s selfish. Obviously easier naturally control comes out, I’m still impressed Hawaii’s ability keep numbers commitment putting people’s safety tourism revenue. No, politicians selected based expertise. fact, humans entire planet qualified handle everything politicians do. really shitty structure. 3 sample 90 people hospitalized vaccinated one dose first 3 weeks? imagine none 2 doses? That's good, optimal good.

ps: I'm downvoted? what? acknowledge science perfect, make mistakes like field

To extent, sure. say like field asinine compare something like astrology science based data. also acknowledge best info time actual science tons data back following that's public policy, legal constitutions, etc, instead globally mandating whatever scientific consensus is?

Nah, that's reason things. We'd much better society based scientific consensus rather lot greed selfishness stuff's based on. I'm primarily talking Australias can't apply wear face mask properly (my 3 year old worn since 2), can't social-distance.

Stupid. Surprise level: 0. Worse. team. higher risk exposure, cover issues hospital. doctors/nurses assigned single department/unit. bottleneck rarely injections. supply. China got high pace initially problems distributing it, built stockpile. reported COVID outbreaks, unwillingness solved itself. stockpile spent, pace slow.

None less, Global Vaccine production 8 billion year end. half world protected. Supply likely sufficient 100% globe mid 2022.

HI second vaccinated state country, I'm sure they'll ever hit 70%. Lol okay fam enjoy feeling better everyone else think complicated that, result political system forcing everyone onto one two teams.

We ended with:

1. wanted schools *and* bars (and almost everything else) remain closed. 

2. wanted everything, schools *and* bars included, remain open. 

There group advocating open schools closed everything else, two political parties 50%+1 party one two aforementioned positions. sure ended compromise did, though. partially true, plenty special industries staff vaccinated also screened (my job included), data smart people look at. Vaccines reduce COVID infection rates. skewed population say.  want stuck home, adapted something pandemic yet. already get used wear mask ( summer version mask called kf-ad.) big picture: Nearly every week past 56 weeks, Axios tracked change — often not, increase — new COVID-19 infections. case counts low, virus well contained, final weekly numbers: U.S. averaged roughly 16,500 new cases per day past week, 30% improvement week before. New cases declined 43 states held steady official case counts haven’t low since Americans went lockdown March last year — pandemic still new, one knew long would go on, inadequate testing meant cases roughly 33 million Americans — 10% population — tested positive 595,000 people died virus U.S., making deadlier Americans past 80 years wars armed military conflicts combined, including World War U.S. largely failed contain virus vaccines businesses began shutting last March. there, virus rolled second wave last summer, cases climbed 65,000 per day, average, hospitals many parts country said failure eclipsed winter, hundreds thousands people per day contracting virus deaths climbed 3,000 per day now, virus really control, nationwide every state, thanks almost entirely vaccines. half American adults fully vaccinated, according CDC. prior organ transplants continued need immunosuppressive drugs keep body rejecting organs. I’ve dutifully followed rules based ‘science’. vaccines kids science told us kids rarely got sick big deal them. there’s vaccine science tells us thing scary kids.  I’m slowly starting go thought dark side- ‘ research’ guys. Bingo. last outbreak Melbourne started handful cases. blows get control. throw much money like, change fact takes months get new factory running. amount raw materials available existence supply chains also limiting factors going change much regardless much money spend.

Also, 20bn may sound like lot, that's peanuts, global scale. I'm surprised little reporting 2.61 HR. know probably come bit data obviously significant useful trying persuade vaccine hesitant. Uhhh...Australia? Home quaratine? Well guess saves trouble manipulating data Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha thought ""vaccine passports"" always referred literally vaccine passports. semantics. Process accelerating evolution virus make infectious study it. yes, technically engineered, conditions created would accelerate evolution specific ways infectious humans. I’m sure can’t wait start exporting shots, making money excerpting soft power third world countries. Also Europe massively increase production domestic demand going plummet matter weeks somewhere doses going go. Apart fact evidence long since deleted, like Covid tests November/December 2019. records researchers going doctor hospital early going say bad cold flu. read cases spread rural regions without much testing capability.

No, OP blamed others “failing stay responsible.” (edit: OP) take blame upon  know that, current rate almost 1.5 daily doses per 100 inhabitants already gave 50 per 100. think giving combination 2 3 dose vaccines (although know waiting periods doses are).

I’m also fully vaccinated.  wearing mask putting limits private gatherings, know normal nowadays. constant wave means alteration 500 700 cases 2 4 deaths per day 51m population. Reading reddit focused thing looking bad data sample. like looking see many people world eat hamburgers going McDonald's. data skewed certain direction... 👏👏👏👏👏 Nearly increase world vaccination rate last month due increase China. might done vaccinations China two months vaccines start going elsewhere, vaccination rates might actually drop. opinion, fact, hence ""I think"".

And base opinion fact countries put restriction Pfizer-BioNTech result data, countries health professionals much expertise do, trust judgement. I’m teacher. 

If district this, would plan I’ve year: protect first. Wear 95 mask class, open windows, stay far away kids possible.

Nothing else do. Masks worn correctly majority kids hard enforce, may make much difference. schools banned students wearing masks. parents still feel they're warranted, welcome demand children wear them.
 
Lifting requirement activity impose restriction it.
 
Thanksgiving months away, like said. Northeast absolutely crushing idk bloomberg says 9 months 75% world pop current rate.. saying wont slow (though global rate still currently increasing) wont hard/require lots $$$ covax poorest nations theoretically enough global herd immunity ~15 months first vaccine approved us sounds like win one wearing masks live NJ. Covid Ohio pretty much back normal. masks mandated unless vaccine yet honestly, folks blended rest. went celebrate start pride day one wearing mask. refreshing scary time. Crazy think light end tunnel might here.

On news though, convention really looking forward August canceled feel like waited least one week canceled :/ Sure - that’s said conducting research publishing. Personally, I’m bothered fact it’s taken long time research conducted, comes women’s health, that’s par course. border

Serious topic, thanks good 🤣 Numbers open everywhere hard guess. 3 billion numbers China EU said would produce. remaining two billion extrpolation form ststisitcs seen. two billion around half, slightly more, produced USA. India, bit less. 

If production expect comes online year around world, maybe could see another billion so.  peak ""I pushing specific agenda."" Stress body tends mess people's cycles, vaccine stress body, surprising impact. I'm Peru. I'm sure countrymen think I'm giving bad publicity go country but... ignore severity virus worse gets since contagious. can't even protect countrymen... What's point publicity? priorities backwards. Well, no... created lab, there's nothing ""natural"" it. 

Have read here: assume means votes Republicans want kill it, although guess might depend upon state. Medicaid Expansion Obamacare big thing states voted against, but, again, people's State Senators, people themselves. (i.e. ""you"" voted elected Republican jerk, *personally* vote like people may done topics things like ballot measures) Yeah officially 11 percent Alabama well, promise actual number closer 50 percent. I'm trying think joke relates discussion username, unfortunately coming blank far. mRNA technologies important discovery antiseptics late 19th century. typical pandemic wave behavior - observed century waves infection epidemic tend roughly symmetric, dropping fast rise crest.
Viral shedding COVID typically peaks 5-6 days infection drops immune system learns make antibodies, spread comes newly infected.  

Simple models pathogen spread herd immunity assume uniformly mixed herd spherical cows 
^(physics joke) .  reality, mesh contacts human society far uniform - almost certainly well-connected subgraphs weakly connected others.

A pathogen reaches one subgraphs spreads easily, so, hits saturation point within segment slows down... Who's ""we""? average number teeth persons mouth gets lower north get! Imagine living so-called ""Enlightenment"" coming idea human beings ""rational actors"" 😂 say 75% COVID-19 shots produced globally year come EU China? Luckily us, everyone needs vaccinated, we’re close point barely reach flu death figures, forgot soon.

I’m sure media won’t let us though. like too. Felt like constantly sick 2020. guess constant low-grade stress tanked immune system. pretend isn’t political failure absurd.

No doubt. Fixing is/should national priority. *sigh* know anyone else...but Newsom presser felt elitist fake. attitude lifting restrictions they're following science make sense areas restrictions lifted months seen rise metrics. seems like he's appealing twitter. worse that. Diarrhea killed ~1/10 Holocaust worth children 2010 alone, unusual 7·6 million deaths children younger 5 years 2010, 64·0% (4·879 million) attributable infectious causes 40·3% (3·072 million) occurred neonates. [..] older children, pneumonia (14·1%; 1·071 million, 0·977-1·176), diarrhoea (9·9%; 0·751 million, 0·538-1·031), malaria (7·4%; 0·564 million, 0·432-0·709) claimed lives. people wonder universal love towards us ""developed"" countries ""developing"" ones. Yeah, difficult. Alpha = UK, Beta = South Africa, Gamma = Brazil, Delta = India. actually makes lot sense allow scientists continue using ""B.1.1.7"" naming system technical side, use something accessible non-stigmatizing ""variants concern"" public facing side. last thing need countries failing search share variant data want ""own"" variant. Eastern Europe vaccinating plenty case counts low, virus well contained, final weekly map.

We war covid 19 vaccines! Botswana also pretty much diamond sub Saharan Africa though. They’ve got shit together. somebody United States who’s job control disease. Good? That's already case anyone refusing flu shots assisted living homes nearly decade nearly efficacious. COVID testing drastically reduced past weeks.  hope numbers stay low, combination lifting restrictions reducing testing time could result artificially lower numbers.  Wait, trucks? duh. hate say it, SARS-CoV-2 cakewalk compared what's possible even likely one considers influenza. lol China exporting fuckton vaccines. diplomatically extremely lucrative. search 'vaccine diplomacy' want know Gotta stop destroying nature viral labs! I’ve seen data suggesting 500k-1m deaths per year malaria, ton people (affects mostly children Ss Africa). LOL, omg made laugh actually snort. lady-like snort. office requires send vaccination proof HR want walk around maskless, thinking also means anyone wearing mask get vaccinated, kinda outing way... broke political pressure last administration little faith CDC effective responding another pandemic. Active case numbers meaningless US. Every state different criteria determining recovered case. New York barely listed cases recovered since start entire pandemic. New cases low. Active cases also low. please go outside touch grass amazing idea  friend honestly sound interesting spy on. Like, China getting this? Basically like Dracula book, good fiction book 
Mix spies fiction, dracula bible letters. 
For similar things 
Create secret plot 
Scare people 
And keep conspiracy theories. It’s coming together. That's right. basing CTV's tracker, also shows Yukon 79.9% eligible people vaccinated, NWT 78%: Yeah, that's kicker. Look mirror America looks like cartoon sometimes. CDC's anemic response big part this. I'm sure political pressure, severely underperformed agency states case positivity rate 3% vaccination rates 60%. Cases lower time last year. would lifting mandates places irresponsible? Maybe should. That's astonishing humbling fact true. doesn’t make sense me. wants shotgun?? Obviously people lots people use them. like Ohio’s plan - give cold, hard, cash 💰. winner buy like. Maybe it’s shotgun. Maybe it’s something else. new variants still spread like wildfire. one checks isolate home  need flights stores? spotting long first shot. weird, happen again. I've fully vaccinated since February. Yea, comment thread weird. Colonialism 70 years certainly fucked every country impacted, would someone try argue contrary? Yes ""securing deals"" small factor, argument similar ""people hood lazy, that's there's poverty."" full it. Actually, that's way saying I'm well informed enough vaccination process Africa say sure one way another. 

So ya, WOULD weird way say agree. diseases (infectious otherwise) political failures covid? Ok. Well. Maybe work getting ready then? Aren’t CDC? Yeah, entirely think regional, strange.  Yeah, find really hard proud Iowan :/ thanks. waiting approval Pfizer Moderna kids. Biden fix way? Pushing frontier humans uncultivated nature brings us contact species diseases Covid19 certainly forget that, broke last year, fact simply ""do part"" order help others, even though means staying home essentially nothing prevent spread COVID-19. amount people know least tertiary contact treat whole situation like farce infuriates me. Death joke, novel virus completely unpredictable unknown us part joke.

I never said gotten vaccine needed it, simply saying demanded far needed used. helped exacerbate situation country like India finds itself. also US forcing export vaccines India. 

As far spending concerned, give us right allow others die create environment happened happen elsewhere. Since largest economy, ""wealthiest country"" believe duty rest world anyone else., looked one world leader.

I'll give original point misguided, seriously die hill one country's citizens matter others. done best even make attempt export something loosen restrictions India's exports rest world, didn't. spend money do, afford to, position in. Even amount spending, theoretically could spending reallocate budget spending, another topic entirely.

I found numbers using CDC data available, mistake. sit 52% 61% population least one dose vaccine, respectively. Almost 90% 98% vaccines given (as relative population many vaccines available, stated). Either way slice it, fact matter selfish face tragedy shuts 5 6b people luxury do. 

I also saying swimming vaccinated people, countries criticizing US past months hoarding vaccines letting go unused rest world struggling, shows duplicity operate. trying get across could easily started exporting vaccines far earlier tail-end May, 2021. Only, that, policies forced export large number vaccines India seeing repercussions this. 

I hope take kind contrarian want see us well. fact, quite opposite, want see us recover, want pandemic recognized national tragedy serious large-scale memorials set amount people lost due virus. 

I think also obvious country would better position large push virus vaccines general right now, point believe lot damage could mitigated. could go talking ages ages, think least agree hypothetical. Trump also controversial dealing Covid-19. president name content probably constantly posted talked might that. Automod could also messed bunch well. everything malicious intent  even specific instance might anything it.

What weird way say agree... know new variants. think part resistance statement flu quite dangerous small amount children. zero risk thing.

I also wonder much averse treatments previous waves many fewer old people. Isn’t Elon Musk named kid? really don’t need mansplaining presymptomatic asymptomatic spread me, well aware difference. point is, currently lot vaccine hesitancy. exactly reason get it, instead ok risk getting spreading others? second dose pfizer really sucked. brain fog three days. Fever chills two. nauseated. Headache. don’t understand anyone would want risk getting covid real, risk symptoms real, months. r/covid19positive ? real people, many young, got long haul covid. cases young people admitted ICU put ventilators. horrifying thing me, sedated machine breathing me. comfortable, potential complications hooked one, 50/50 chance coming alive dying. lets say ok getting covid. also ok possibly spreading toddler flying? unvaccinated classmates college? Sure, covid numbers down, actually *the same* amongst unvaccinated. people getting vaccinated enough currently prevent unvaccinated infecting other. flying later month toddler really anxious mess. found straight airline stewardess easily upwards 50% airline staff antivax. Add that, young people willingly refuse get vaccinated, puts unvaccinated toddler even risk. people real blood clotting disorders cannot get vaccine yet. immune compromised even vaccine nearly effective medications take. older people like dad vaccinated, still get covid exposed heavy enough viral load. Oregon far 1000 breakthrough cases (where fully vaccinated person still got covid - don’t serious infection thanks vaccine, 2% people still died). choosing willingly vaccinate, also going stay masked mask mandates lifted? protect people truly cannot luxury choose vaccinated? potentially vulnerable exposed high enough viral load? fair people really depend herd immunity live hiding forever? Look, I’m bully scare tactic anything. Getting vaccine anything medical truly personal choice. think potential effects everyone else around you. butterfly effect real. Taiwan covid free year half. Life beautiful perfectly normal, whole world applauded stunning model pandemic control, amazing job protecting millions people extremely dense urban settings people use public transit. took pre-symptomatic airline staff quarantined three days opposed least 10-14 wreck Taiwan. zero case numbers numbering hundreds daily (thousands previously) shutting down. 95 year old grandma back sheltering home alone herself. elderly need socializing maintain healthy lifestyle, isn’t food exercise keeps people ticking. skeptical mrna vaccines, consider johnson johnson traditional adenovirus vaccine. pandemic isn’t 80% vaccinated get real herd immunity, you’d surprised positive difference you’d make got sooner later. People like would really really grateful. know, dollar store pregnancy tests good $5-$10 ones. bought bulk pack Amazon 50 tests 20 bucks IUD appreciate monthly check. science validated vaccinated people don’t need wear mask.

Also yeah, Newsom could rejected didn’t *Wars intentional killings*, notable. I’m aware pandemic disease intentionally spread, outside use biological weapons criminal activity. 

Deaths disease much higher deaths war - pretty much always case.

Also anyone gotten vaccine protected (if vaccine indeed work) anyone didn’t voluntary choice accepts risk.

Pretty interesting point. check mine one shots record I’m definitely underreported Boo-hoo it’s piece fucking fabric get answer this, instead people start calling names don’t reasonable answer. 

That’s do. don’t even give shit anymore. Sheitttttt also hope that. would investing wind solar decade ago. live get really high winds north almost 24 hours sunlight seems like brainer.

So adequate time approve vaccines younger people.

Their entire strategy seems priority approval vaccines ample deliveries vaccines cannot delivered (j&amp;j, Novavax) Americans dumb super political. Whatever party identify right wrong. incredibly pessemistic nihilistic person even surprised last year half, pandemic beat every worst expectation every person, politician government handled this. US continue divided double standards two party system. wife's nurse. We're Ohio. area outbreak mostly teenagers. I'm going told me. something really sunk yet lot people fully recover. we've lifted restrictions time kids working full time summer jobs. kept mask mandates vaccinated. numbers, 10% kids getting hospitalized going home inhalers. can't diagnosed long haulers symptoms prolonged period.  Wait, actually thing? ventilation casino really good? 🙄 think onto something, although even asymptomatic infection confers immunity. sort makes sense ""normal"" response ""normal"" viral load elicit better immune response ""low"" response ""low"" viral load.

There remains problem people know they've contracted disease symptoms developed testing (or self-diagnosed even testing available). Many people definitely Covid not. believe incorrect self-diagnosis main reason prior infection factored vaccination program.

We initially estimated 80% infections asymptomatic, know true (in fact, could 80% symptomatic). also caused lot confusion around immunity natural infection. vaccination numbers. take Covid-19 seriously.

Dude, Australia months worth lockdown without repeating reopening/closing 2020. results, **very little** cases zero deaths. honestly fuck animals. figured solar panels get energy direct sun everything else middleman. Everyday come hoping opposite everyday I'm bit sadder. Australia vaccinated time, despite federal government dragging arse, infectivity levels anywhere else. outbreak surprise Australians complacent success suppressing COVID. Australians start accepting outbreaks even good vaccination coverage outbreaks much easily managed. Considering 3rd best GDP results latest quarterly results, suppression vaccination strategy appear losing strategy. year counting lol going doctor, fill form asked preference, wrote no, got Astrazeneca. fine me! good enough pretty much whole UK, fine too.

Especially since pre-40 woman taking pill. still alive crazy.

I believe need open everywhere virus manageable wait long many mutations enough people exposure to. Right, think downvotes would even worse came R0 6.75 instead 6. China laws protect citizens' medical records. can't demand hand over.

Hopefully Indian Delta Variant seems like better fuck around find out. Hello everyone

I got first dose astrazeneca 3 month ago due recent blood clots cases decided wait Pfizer Moderna second dose

Will still protected one dose astrazeneca? corona december still regained sense smell , over?

Will ever come back? anything do? 15% population UK adults. 50% adult population 42.5% total population. 70% adult population 59.5% total population. one get? 

Had similar situation UK - got Astrazeneca vaccine could get immediately, Pfizer would taken 7 weeks longer get (My age bracket getting Pfizer one now, got left-over AZ vaccine 7 weeks ago). Got second jab next week. NEXT THING THEY'LL REQUIRE DRIVER'S LICENSE...

A DRIVER'S LICENSE!!!!1! already case medical field take flu vaccine. Two wings party capital, folks still buy team colors mascots.

Pinning blame china always US' interest geopolitically. Trump making case frankly looked like making excuses US poorly. Biden pushing appears credible, might stick. 

(Regardless truth actually is) inevitable bother getting vaccinated? Could best strategy suppress best possible vaccination renders outbreaks managable without lockdowns?  Absolutely. I’m central California EVERYone know seemed COVID back January/February including mother. doctor advising wait 6 months getting jab. getting one weeks. Oh yes did. I’m extremely hopeful Curevac vaccine, think large chance used booster initial vaccine. still idea it’s efficacy, seem issue collecting enough data due low infection rates. California? Disney World FL. Oh fucks sake many kajillion times fall this? specifically NH That's false. Hopefully. think also CureVac gets it’s final results, it’s conclusive EMA approved, production started optimist deliver whole bunch doses once. would definitely give boost campaign 34-. made decision visit state high cases numbers daily reports available. YES!!! gladly show vaccine card means visit fam!  keep mind, mutation vaccine resistant happens, it’s going easily travel across globe…so would probably happen somewhere else much higher population US get anyway, it’s worth worrying about. People get vaccine also unlikely get COVID die it. vaccines relative risk reduction absolute risk reduction, average unvaccinated person low chance dying COVID. know right many cases vaccinated people?

This information interesting, know Chile 80% new cases unvaccinated almost totality (of vaccinated ones) hospitalized still reporting CDC daily.  well it’s delayed doses Q4 advance, doses previously confirmed accounted for, chance delay. 

In Germany expect higher expected number doses last two weeks June, hopefully compensated elsewhere too. vaccine wasn’t available everyone meant putting everyone jeopardy ones refuse vaccine. word mutation alone terrifying. Belgium depends per region. friend Brussels who’s 36 gets first shot next week. I’m 39 Flanders get 2 weeks. adoption rate higher makes sense takes time. know early pandemic Korea relied contact tracing 

And lockdwon.

They able stay covid free solid 6 months. it’s time weed em  one RN know isn’t “getting anything isn’t 100%”

I shouldn’t know vaccines spread viruses medical professional insane  delivery problem actual delivery Q2 advance delivery Q4?

70% *total population* herd immunity.

We're 59.8% total population one dose (which equates 75% adults).

We're herd immunity yet. nitpick really US European (EU + UK) R&amp;D investments made vaccines possible. invested research past decades invested companies early development vaccines. 

A massive difference two investment objective. US create much vaccination capacity citizens, trying close exclusive deals using DPA ensure production would US shots even though shots could deliver. European side investments open. Production ramped Europe never claimed vaccines could deliver. actively promoted global collaboration.

Only thing US ""global"" WTO IP waiver. Based what? makes believe that? get groceries though right?  Well now, makes whatever they're Florida perfectly justifiable then.

Fewer Fox news viewers /s wonder would test efficacy dangerous viruses like hiv etc Agree 100%. Trump help things all. election year help things fact remains Americans highly individualistic. Even Trump come day 1 told people real wear masks bunch people wouldn't. look things now. Trump told people get shot he's talked awesome Warp Speed yet still people get shot 'cuz ""muh rights"". way Americans are. Bingo. many countries - particularly U.S. - another enormous problem pandemic immediately became hyper-partisan political issue rather public health issue.

Rather ""rally around flag"" effect sometimes see disasters, discourse around pandemic *immediately* devolved usual red vs. blue talking points. people virus, democrats versus republicans.

Unfortunately, tendency towards extreme polarization going away anytime soon deeply ingrained trait country's DNA moment - another pandemic crops up, issue rear ugly head. 2% fully, 17% one dose

Gov incompetent people complacent Almost like 10 countries variants risk us past generations? Spanish flu hit variations eventually disease ended own. SARS MERS fizzled quickly never became pandemics though (and never got around finishing vaccine development anyway). push hard mass vaccination 2009 Swine Flu pandemic H1N1 virus Spanish Flu. Wouldn’t Moderna best bet One [England study found 57% 63% reduction risk symptomatic infection over-80s Pfizer Oxford-Astrazeneca jabs respectively, 14 days single dose. Another [UK study looking vaccines found ""three weeks [first] jab ... infections symptoms fell 74%, infections reported symptoms fell 57%"", little difference two vaccines. Game... blouses vaccines cheap, like $2 dose Astra Zeneca? it’s financial problem even poorest countries world Thank sharing that, think good hear others situation really think gets enough coverage! agree though, one frustrating parts seem follow logic really. Half world remains unrestricted people need negative result enter US. Meanwhile, people like unable enter even though vaccinated legitimate reasons. hope resolution soon sounds extremely specific, given we're human, environments fairly similar. wonder, position might sensible new cold remedies, position still stand emergency? One problems Europe treating vaccines caution regular medicine would receive normal times 1000s people dying day. africans: regular what? Part problem honestly covid hit election year. makes things bajillion times worse. hit year even 2018, things would've different IMO. It’s everyone get vaccinated. Kids still aren’t eligible. 

My kids stuck home fall. I'm embarassed live days. Mask usage town dropped like 25% people wearing outside 50% people wearing one inside point. 

Some businesses still mask mandates seem gradually way out. Belgium high vaccine acceptance? Orleans Parish 50% vaccinated +85% Democrats, think it’s Republicans?  say like that’s good thing. majority people need shot reduce death rate. Compare Germany Spain. Spanish death rate currently way lower German one. It’s focused way people die this. giving people pushy enough get earlier. knowledge use bot Skripts get appointment.

I disappointed things going. many people know need vaccination get yet. perfectly healthy people low risk catching getting first shot. Whelp plague rat electeds convinced people real/a big deal/""would never happen me"", posts calling deleted instantly, days people civil enough care public health kinda True, procuring proper cold storage infrastructure also plays part. Though worth noting J&amp;J vaccine needs standard refrigerator temperature, much hurdle 6 months ago. yes indeed Rapidly turning Kölsch weather Also, space hospitals less serious cases, could take teens children previously maybe would sent home. Took plunge ditched mask (where allowed vaccinated am). Tell ya w'hat, feels good.   Got 2nd vaccine yesterday (Pfizer). say, first one terrible...this one far bad still pretty bad. really dread idea boosters shit knock bad time. hope update vaccines cause many bad side effects. Isn’t gonna time grandmas people pre-existing conditions US get boosters, another round vaccines, December? general consensus seems vaccine provides immunity year, judging Pfizer’s recent comments boosters. 

Granted, it’ll likely go faster due fact production ramped significantly, next round vaccinations would happening Biden administration. However, goes show won’t time 100% world’s population vaccinated simultaneously, there’s eradicating SARS-Cov 2. 

By time developing countries get vaccine next year, elderly US UK need boosters. Approval mean administrate immideately. guess phase 3 clinical trial countries. Vaccines still shortage China, they're improving second dose month. know conservatives hidden got vaccinated know unpopular among peers. also know conservatives told conservative peers yelled it. 

Trump Melania, example, got vaccinated January didn’t tell anyone two months. That’s really good. Germany it’s like that. need really work get appointment. Eh, fair, lot ""rednecks"" also go coastal cities gentrify working class neighborhoods (I'm NY there's ton come try live Sex City life gentrify Latinos Bushwick whatever). wait til then? post removed? clear me, worries  holy fuck, last time checked, world 6bn people. 

fucking hell, feel old important thing prepare next pandemic universal flu vaccine. know possible, governments fund R&amp;D.

As NPI think offering free N95s maybe intervention lowest impact society. Pretty sure going see many masks next winter. (Most) (Western) People like that. conservative: eVeN wOnT tAkE vAcCiNe, SaY numbers percent people vaccinated total population? metric total population states younger populations skew lower. It’s helpful metric looking eligible vaccinated. gets people get vaccinated, worth it. scouring internet found nothing ask here, info one get EU green card covid-certificate travel inoculated ONE dose? 15 cases soon 0? Every single enclosed space decent air filtration. microbes, also allergens pollutants people live cities. Lagos Nigeria 14 million people. super easy get vaccines soon they're produced. need wait months Next AR15s pickup truck raffles, effective disagree here. worldwide cabal got together saw great opportunity use pandemic control people. 

What we're seeing downside bureaucracy. inherently resistant change status quo slow react. beginning countries slow shutting travel taking steps protect elderly bureaucracy slow react. slow react new reality much higher levels community immunity still reacting like half year ago. Um posts Japan exists mock Japan?

Here 40-65 pre-existing condition's appointment begin Jun.21.Still hoping stop stupid Olympics. explain Australia, New Zealand, South Korea's effective response? Maybe could get US pay it?  Yeah is. Yeah doubt EDS top priority kind treatment, problems associated already happened (all siblings scoliosis, two fused spines surgery), curious. Thanks! One thing really need understand better antibodies confer protection. mean vaccine could designed good preventing ""cases"" due lack specificity, still give one boost protective immunity since generated antibodies still affinity virus.

Since noroviruses seasonal seasonality like flu, people want could get annual booster. could still get disease, milder version it.

We see covid, virus cannot mutate enough escape protective immunity, mutate escape level sterilising immunity. virus endemic, possible focus could put protecting vulnerable people, especially complete sterilising immunity seems major challenge (compared to, say, measles achieved particularly efficiently).

I've often thought microbiome would would see big advances 21st century, really whole immune system (and microbiome interface it) know damn little about. Perhaps create coffee table book funny things state could give away entice people get vaccine. 300m total across one two dose vaccinations. Almost exactly 50% population least one dose. Wheat beer slice lemon ain't shabby hot one. Eyyy, home CDC, can’t far top!

Oh.

Oh no. Deer aren’t endangered  Yes, absolutely, also depends live variant dominating. Two doses much better one though make sure receive second dose. look pandemic changed Britain program using combination AZ Pfizer. Completely second that. exactly position (working USA VISA) cannot go visit family home country, despite fully vaccinated paying quite lot taxes US government. disappointed Biden keeping policy previous administration without sort scientific evidence. little stop COVID too, excludes countries exploding cases (e.g. Argentina), account vaxx status require people travel quarantine whatever. anyone know genetic sequence SARS virus isolated bats mentioned Smithsonian magazine? exact name it? percentage similarity wuhan one? Shotguns even less likely used gun murders rifles. 2017, handguns involved majority (64%) 10,982 U.S. gun murders non-negligent manslaughters data available, according FBI. Rifles – category includes many guns sometimes referred “assault weapons”– involved 4%. **Shotguns involved 2%.**

If giving away handgun, maybe comment would apply. areas studied, report says roughly 10% population. Draw conclusions that. Here's Japanese old lady pre-existing condition desperately waiting turn :/

There loud people want spread crazy theory (Who read Epoch times),also gullible people,but majority. read, counts towards areas studied, equated 10% US population. Along extremely selfish many us are, that’s main lesson took away too. Also American. CDC tracks this. 12 up, 60.5% one dose, 49% fully add something touched upon within article - restrictions affect US visa holders reside states, US citizens green card holders. means return home country (assuming one facing restrictions), cannot fly back job position without staying somewhere like Mexico 14 full days first. most, that's possible financially amount holiday would require book, causing pretty prolonged separation now.

To add this, also used embassies restricted countries reason issue visas, led massive amounts stress issues would-be visa holders. example, Fiancés hoping marry subsequently live together states K1 visa faced massive backlogs despite paying copious amounts money visas. couples separated year, included. 

This also stopped people going working jobs would otherwise started months ago. people accepted job go work USA, embassies grinding halt, unable take position. There's lot examples could go into, want write whole essay.

I wanted post show even though some, travel tourism seeing sights, others might mean seeing loved ones dearly miss. others, might mean chance better life, working dream job. something happens restrictions, people's lives continue limbo. lot false commenting Covid worse flu kids.

How false? backed reputable sources date, 74 million children United States, 300 COVID deaths thousand serious illnesses. Hospitalization numbers look worse, Dr. Roshni Mathew Stanford's Children's Hospital says numbers MATHEW: hospitals, child walks hospital admission, get swabbed hospital's experience, nearly half children positive COVID tests actually sick completely unrelated diagnosis, like appendicitis femur fracture something **In children, least, risk serious consequences COVID risk face flu, says**.

So seems disagreement facts NYT article NPR interview, two sources high quality. possible measuring slightly different things. Sorry misspoke. Third wave. confused too. Ray guns? next pandemic involve flu strain, could also another coronavirus, hantavirus, henipavirus (lassa, nipah), filovirus (Ebola-/Marburg-like), something completely unknown yet (""Disease X""). could highly pathogenic flu virus mutates something much transmissible. next one may comparatively ""benign"" SARS-CoV-2, IFR closer 10% (SARS), 30% (MERS), 50+% (H7N9) 75% (Nipah). 
 
Bad current pandemic is, cake walk compared might one day jump animal-human divide. absolutely ready - national level, global level. state anywhere even remotely close 50% population age 12. Every single state 20-27% age 18 (easier find 12, vast majority states 21-24%, Texas 27%) except Utah 31%. saying ain't driving factor. end? increased restrictions gradually going away lately. Okay mean...this isn’t tied vaccination rates really. don’t think plan lift emergency declaration pandemic pretty much declared over, probably won’t happen kids receive vaccine.

Vaccination rates potential rise cases would tied lifting COVID restrictions, still much going happen June 15. Fairly sensible trust gov Russian citizen.  Sounds right..

I guess redditers super rich??? read article?

Yes? like four sentences long COVID restrictions lifted June mandate give authority implement regulations policies without going legislator.

Again... find surprising considering hit goals set earlier year. Absolutely. major metro areas experience next nothing outbreaks probably limited rural areas. 

I doubt panic surrounding medical resources, probably ship patients rural areas areas resources since areas resources experiencing outbreaks all.  No, I’d willing bet statistically picked random person truck drinks shitty beer, they’re likely anti-vax general population girlfriend got second dose days got first dose. force wear mask alongside keep playing field even. we're 26... Killing Harambe shifted universe another time-line can't convince otherwise title correct, referring adults only. 41% entire population fully vaccinated, go adults go 50%.

It’s Californians taking every state lol     We're absolutely prepared pandemic high death rate across age groups. all. even close. seem implying majority COVID outbreaks Canada tied illegal US border crossings. incorrect.

While US-Canada border 'closed' millions people still crossed legally article linked referring to. Newsome validating reasonable worries politicians using Covid pandemic excuse grab power. lot people reason want even though everyone walk get one wait schedule majority US republican males. typical anti-vaxers, specifically anti-covid vax become tribal issue. ultra hippie anti vaxers obviously part, much smaller segment.  ...and thinks 50% anything proud of? Shotguns like... murder weapon choice.

Also, get outside three urban areas, odds dying gun violence drop dramatically.

It’s far less American problem small-number-of-American-cities problem.  party nothing obstruction…

While true, GOP nothing article lol surprising, really, seem like maintained high vaccination rate first month rollout. irony many people (NOT you, definitely people) complaining masks worst things they’ve ever wear, plenty uncomfortable things voluntarily health benefit benefit others.

My comment response attacking personally, general statement regarding hearing many people south complain masks oppressive threatening way. Tagging onto this- eating deer keeps population manageable deer subject disease overpopulated. 

Eating deer literally decreases disease risks.   Please don’t forget people cannot get vaccinated. People certain blood clotting disorders advised getting vaccine. everyone able get Newsome feels needs power act unilaterally. Shotguns manage deer populations feeds poor people.

But f—k hicks, right? Gov democrat thou Production vaccines increasing daily. Hopefully take year half get ""herd immunity"" world. don’t disagree, that’s huge trust system we’re working right now. south, people aren’t even kids wear masks anywhere anymore, neither adults, 36% adults fully vaccinated.  hope numbers remain low throughout high heat humidity summer. MOKDAD: virus mutating faster rate ever expected. seeing new mutations every then, many dangerous.

MOKDAD: They're likely transmitted. one seen, U.K. variant. they're likely make vaccines less effective. previous infections protective well**. that's problem - one spread much faster, deadly.

We’re verge getting rid things. that’s I’m saying, flu bad enough, flu causes 2-3 times hospitalizations, killed 300 kids (with precautions), still learning long term effects like seems triggering spikes diabetes children, it’s worth keeping little caution vaccinated Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC), children generally appear less severely impacted COVID-19 adults. new study Children's Hospital Los Angeles shows pandemic could affecting children's health unexpected ways. study reveals surge patients presenting diabetic ketoacidosis, severe complication type 2 calling shutdowns, people need go live lives. what’s harm wearing mask go grocery store months? agree reactionary (i'm California liberal), complicated Cal OSHA governed board votes based scientific opinion, member &amp; union concerns. Obviously, unions want masks mandated case numbers drop low possible. also minority-advocacy groups want time get black &amp; brown workers vaccinated. communities much skeptical Western medicine consciously avoid doctors sick. groups want time convince lower-income blue-collar folk get shots. Probably millions billions mutations every day. Call us one variants escapes mRNA vector based vaccines - then, variant fearmongering getting really exhausting. else handguns, shotguns, rifles?

Where 30%? Appreciate keeping attention US despite south. omega variant?!? parents went dinner first time 15 months last week. It’s weird time panic, vaccinations keep wave low non-lethal, soon quash it. recall discussing time, sure bad advice. shots EU safe effective. It’s extremely important OP get vaccinated soon possible help put dent spread. doesnt 11 days. UK trials graph symptom onset date diverge like day 25ish, slowly. first dose lot work vectored vaccines takes time.

Stop fearmongering. Rapid antigen test takes 15 minutes, got one local pharmacy done emailed results 15 mins later used drive Italy. interesting post travel sub recently. Guy US went Italy back work, spent around $400 tests. Pretty wild. Soon really 15 cases, zero. Nothing unvaccinated protects community spawning spreading variant though. Original COVID spreading amongst unvaccinated isn’t causing selective pressure variants succeeding. It’s random mutation event viral replication. people infected though, opportunities exist variants pop up. COVID variants aren’t going originate people can’t COVID first place, vaccinated areas statistically better off. 

It may possible resistant variants spread vaccinated population, it’s going *also* spread unvaccinated population, probably worse areas also tend shun precautions well. worst case scenario vaccinated you’re equivalent unvaccinated, case vaccines aren’t 100% effective, they’re still *pretty darn effective*, leaving areas better off. even argument?

Only try hard B.1.617.2 aka delta contagious enough immune escape weakly vaccinated people definitely transmit it, strongly vaccinated people occasionally can. likely total delta cases rising every country except Israel (65% strongly vaccinated summer), even cases dropping.

Doooooooooooom, 204 teen cases!! It’s like pandemic starting 😭😭 always vaccine, distancing measures stopgap measure get us could vaccinate people. viable vaccine point, caught COVID would protected would still need people mitigate risk distancing masking. yes, vaccines important masks social distancing, long run vaccines prevent far people ever deal COVID. since vaccinated people still transmit virus others, breakthrough cases still possible cruise ship. wouldn’t matter. wrong?

Yes! Completely wrong! keep making absurd conclusions based absolutist binary true/false statements. thinking always ""either vaccinated people get infected can't"" ""either vaccinated people transmit virus can't"" work like all.

The fact vaccine significantly reduces infection transmission. way works take values, mathematical calculations determine level transmission infection different vaccination rates, work point, vaccination rates high enough, virus simply can't propagate enough keep infection rates increasing stable - fall even without social distancing etc. 

For constantly talk terms ""either work don't"" complete misunderstanding principles upon things understood calculated. like saying ""people seatbelts still killed, what's point?"". keep employing flawed logic matter much pointed specious is. Stop trying come scenarios mangled logic whereby vaccination rates matter. fact vaccines inhibiting infection transmission, always going beneficial higher vaccination rates. may well spend time trying levitate lifting legs up. fool's errand.

You claimed understand herd immunity was, understand all. Herd immunity need 100% immunity work. understand why, made significant step towards longer making specious points.  posted archive link read without sub[archive link anyone trouble accessing article know get opened post text.

Somehow get feeling ""one man blame"" convenient oversimplification.  concerned need rising # cases UK?

Per ""Ourworldindata"", confirmed UK COVID cases/million fell far 22 April back around 60. R0 1.35.

The UK done quite well rolling vaccinations testing, ""surge"" still nearly close pandemic high 881/million, great trend.

My thought mini-increase contained, like little bump chart opposed huge spike cases eventually return trending lower. 

That said, variant inevitably makes way US, might expect similar increase shock case rates got back 30k range settling again. posted archive link read without sub.  agree SF better rest Bay Area. understand city got large initial vaccine allotment state.

New Yorker good article SF Bay Area's initial response pandemic, different neighborhoods great job, ok….? Man, GOP numb nuts really exemplify opinion - Idiots entire lot you. think need spend years studying come conclusion physically separating people prevents spread communicable illness. physical separation could form closed borders travel restrictions, physical distance people, physical barrier people face shield mask. extremely hard overcome need people socially interact one another transact business person - virus can't jump one person another anyone else around. CEO BioNTech statement ya kook?  Fully vaxxed people don’t need mask up, you’re fine. would sure 'end' eventually, would take years. 'ending' we're talking likely becomes seasonal cold, variants causing natural immunity quite completely immune typically minimizing seriousness infection. 


The vaccines, least nations get large mount people vaccinated speeding end pandemic years. wish publicized fact 45 years old underlying conditions Covid big deal. good context clues reading comprehension huh? also thought two things. friend want vaccine get wants hang out, I? think should.

Also, pre-existing condition, could go restaurant something vaccine? 35 hours since first arm pain pretty much gone I’m starting think jumped line hella early. Sure guy said Florida poorly, responded ""nah case rate average."".  understand using Florida's published case rate indicator success problematic, use defend Florida? We’re gonna send guys doses. Mexico possibly important trading partner, god knows depend migrant workers.  others think safe go without mask vaccinated US? 

I vaccinated, also strictly quarantining family since started. basically gone whole time family.

Just wondering others think. help grandmother lot super important help her. vaccinated too. family.

But, safe? really want get want anyone family get it. said, we've super secluded whole time. okay go out?  people utterly ignore news around world!? makes crazy. Like can't even comprehend shit going somewhere else see eyeballs.

Of course, closed borders helped economy short term Australia lose lot money people travelling overseas people coming in.

And mention deaths relatively non-existent here, besides Melbourne, think single part Australia lockdown lasted 2 weeks 

But relatives overseas, hard (more country) Israel similar vaccination rates, completely open, cases rising. much travel India.

The point vaccine ultimately reduce deaths severity - that's does. still carry covid. still show symptoms. body knows fight now. can't believe many stupid people are.. sort can. No, really? would thought? strategy az. pziler.

Seems ramped now. Still supply issue.  one dose Astra Zeneca give least protection? mean go crowded places even step out, want know whether first dose helpful. 11 days since first dose. sorry ""immune"" meaning 3 weeks first dose. spend time around group people carelessly - feel sick like covid (quik-krete lungs, wheezing, bogged, mood swings, fever) exceptionally mild lasts 1 day instead 3+weeks.  
Do understand? Maybe ought research vaccines work. Many states lifted mask requirements schools, even banned schools requiring masks. Fauci stated vaccines won’t approved kids 12 thanksgiving. someone explain insane decline cases India seeing? need keep mind evidence based strictly populations vaccinated getting tested. 

Most people still seem think vaccinated means can’t get COVID, means vaccinated people likely assume symptoms result cold allergies (especially since many people also seem think COVID causes fever assume don’t fever can’t COVID). 

It’s unlikely many vaccinated people actually tested COVID still don’t really decent contact tracing place, statistics based skewed population. virus wants spread become contagious, easily trasmissable, best interest kill infected. That's variants hit also children. 
Sometimes young people also get long covid sucks. seems slighly different kind disease actual covid infection, similar myalgic encelophatitis way, different approach treat etc. 
About asymptomatic spread, people say rarely happens, actually presymptomatic spread. 

I well informed neither two topics expecially last one, that's know. would like proper research time though. sucks somebody thinks like willingfully spread antivax misinformation, thats case

BTW say single 18 year old world long covid thats good sign, right? 😃

Anyway, speaking (not counting trasmission may potentially responsible for, awful aspect covid mess) certainly afraid long short covid, amount scare campaigns bother me. 

After older people get vaccined reached satisfying percentage, vaccinate university requires me.  Thank that.  Sure Florida's right thing far.  talking about? UK Bolton US... Why? intents purposes, Moderna Pfizer considered equivalent terms safety profile. in, let's say accidentally injected opposing vaccine second dose, would need observed extra carefully? Would therefore also fair say potential booster shot mRNA manufacturer would given matter (mRNA) vaccine used before? They’ve already found vaccine less effective new variants.

Notes: 

* Population uses 2020 estimates, such, percentages slightly lag CDC's 2019 population data.  Hasn’t made case spike anywhere else. Yes, think saying thing here. concerned worried increase probability functional variants presents. would need know many average person comparison first, number seems quite high. case, opportunities potentially make virus contagious deadly essentially. Given many are, would ton people could become incubators new variants worse. Ah ok. ended Memorial Day basically wasn’t sure still tracked reported. reporting daily, headline misleading. 

The CDC still tracking virus variants, Florida releasing state numbers daily basis. I’m glad able fully vaccinated mask mandate lifted. lifted vaccine even available everyone (I autoimmune disease qualified early thank god). soon lifted, kids’ school stopped requiring them. glad didn’t worry kids bringing covid home killing me. still worry kids least kids aren’t affected badly.  seems (I'm southeast alaska, closer you) smaller towns villages community oriented due fact they're isolated many places people related. lot social programs either city/town native tribes.

The metro area Anchorage full people southern states like Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana... places oil gas big, also traditionally conservative.

Southeast alaska much similar BC, type 9f people/attitude. mean, part feels like, reading lines, Biden like, “open everything up. fuck it, wanna die, die.” tell tech possible would sale every pet company world pet owners would love able permanently track pets. Fantastic news. Hope vaccinate everyone soon! tickets visit 92 year old grandmother Jupiter 2 weeks. Bringing 8 year old boy, can't vaccinated. What's risk? way knowing now. That's people care. people need grow realize world extends beyond end nose. actual balanced response, rare! “The states lowest vaccination rates: ""Alaska, Arkansas, Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee Wyoming..""

*me considering rest us lose able travel states*:

“Oh no! Anyway...” seems bit nuts. you’re vaccinated, don’t catch pass virus, mask necessary. you’re vaccinated care, you‘ll wear mask volition, requirement necessary. you’re vaccinated don’t care, soon gain antibodies hard way, masking work mute. I’d pay boost anyone who’s vaccinated they’ll reliable, potentially sick three months so. taken one day learn variant ones care about.

Also, Greek letters hell lot useful one country get two prominent variants. example, Kappa Delta Indian variants. noticed username ha. Ya I've work seen anything beyond Anchorage, Wasilla Knik Goose Bay road... QUITE conservative compared BC lol. figured smaller town would even worse regard. Thanks info :) They'd probably move combinations two letters way digits, i.e. omega would come alpha-alpha, alpha-beta, etc. Then, get alpha-omega, next variant would beta-alpha, (extremely unlikely) event ever reach omega-omega, next variant would called alpha-alpha-alpha. like base 10 numbering system, classification could theory go forever. Fuck ‘em. guess “coastal elites” = people fucking brain. dread coming autumn year. good lord yes Ah, “sack oranges” method Indeed. It’s worrying western countries pretending things still thousands daily cases. It’s like haven’t learned anything past year. end June. believe year June 25th. authorized May 12th ages 12-15. Even got vaccinated literally day, would gotten second shot week. takes time work aren’t protected overnight. anyone vaccinated can't come work get paid unless medical exemption Two weeks guys! Alaska one surprises me. Also Illinois close joining 70% states. 67% currently. India : hold cow urine.

Already everyone seeing govt undercounting numbers, obituaries show lot people died usual, bodies thrown rivers. Every days get see happening govt numbers dont reflect reality. past year tough them.

It complete bullshit suggest wearing mask tough anyone typical age 4. less kids would start.

This already happening. states positivity rates like FL really low raw case counts. FL stands alone many cases every day positivity high do. Soviet Union one environmentally destructive states human history

Also current China capitalist government going say ""buy less stuff"", solution this.

No not. engineered way engineering way too. Thank you!! get part quantity isn’t important individual unless functional. Viruses constantly mutate.  Update: got shot today, foot like 90% less painful now. still walk bit funny hurt much anymore.

What great timing.  pandemic unvaccinated. still it.

[Cleveland clinic study: 99.75% hospitalized covid patients Yeh sort missed point here. mutations = opportunities functional variants. yet. seen far better equipped countries cases spike due Indian variant. Wait couple weeks cases UK also rise. Mass data town lot issues, particularly towns colleges. Towns like Amherst, Wellesley, Newton seem correctly counting college students. disagree. states nowhere near 70%, seem problem. state (Arizona) pretty mediocre, 36% fully vaccinated, far herd immunity. we've restrictions months (jumped gun) metrics budged, they've gone anything. Every surge happened much faster, much restrictions place. 

I think pretty obvious must due natural immunity bolstering vaccinated immunity, 36% nowhere near herd immunity. infection rate Arizona extremely high, top 10 country per capita. feel like sitting duck all. Feels immune. seems foolish totally ignore entire aspect natural immunity look vaccination rates exclusively trying figure places vulnerable surge. HIPAA also hate here. think important federal government health authorities know numbers look like 3rd populous state? many, MANY reasons hate there, removing children equation, 64% adults vaccinated, far 70% people hope for. specifically small number people referring to. biases? Try facts ground. Every place mentioned lagging vaccine uptake overall level education. correlated. Am.i biased idiotic people cluster parts country? damn right am. California fucked places too. Nowhere perfect. relatively uneducated southern states leading charge idiocy. Luckily, “No adolescent deaths virus occurred time period, according CDC.” devastating era able hop plane fly another country over. three times weekly PCR testing. 

Also, pay :) “...hospitalization rates among adolescents 12 17 increased March 1 April 24”

Ok... happened rates since April 24? month ago. 

Also: “However, teen hospitalizations rates March 1 April 24 still 12.5 times lower adults 18 older...”

So actual numbers involved here? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Yeah, can't wrap head around intentions timing. giving CDC time respond inquiry, also putting lot pressure districts act quickly (and, regardless choice, plenty angry parents).

They could taken small step...lift mandate anyone fully vaccinated (which really upperclassmen staff) allow masks removed outdoors. would satisfy issue brought regarding camps, would still give leverage push parents vaccinate kids. head Centers Disease Control Prevention Friday urged parents vaccinate teenagers Covid-19, citing rise number adolescents hospitalized disease **in March April**.

So, basically old news, teens eligible vaccinated. Canada starting slow first doses. 36 percent days doses went second doses, percentage go second doses Children less likely transmit adults, turns out. They're quite sure why. That’s good one ☝️ worries! Yea, need use italics sarcasm font type. probably looked stats that’s case. best thing stay home. Case rate controls population though lol exactly telling truth either. 

Hospitals overrun, waves. wave low point hospitals overrun, services stopped elective surgeries (which huge moneymaker) resume. That's nurses staff laid off. 

As second point, I'm sure insinuating, easily explained numerous factors actually listed state people actually view numbers interesting Googles stats show state anywhere near 70% even partially vaccinated. June 4th California 57% partially vaccinated.

What gives? There's around 42 million Americans aged 10 19, 204 teens hospitalized? Seems like bit overreaction CDC director. crappy headline would be. future journalism “Leadership matters. set tone isn’t serious, it’s hard convince people is.”

If causing much death sickness would people need convinced serious? Everyone would know many people affected caution may take months.... persuade unwilling get shot.


If know many people hospitalized dead would need persuaded? It’s everyone paying thousands hospitalizations increased insurance premiums higher spreading among unvaccinated carries costs, too, says. people end hospital, private insurance, costs get passed others higher insurance premiums. person government health plan, Medicare, Medicaid Tricare military members families, costs passed taxpayers. person insurance, hospitals pass costs patients. “It’s like cost-free doesn’t impact rest us, 

In case, AZ vaccine protects severe disease, getting transmitting covid.. pfizer moderna fare better Yes. I'd say that's pretty true many big cities. large conservative area Anchorage/Wasilla/Palmer Kenai peninsula accounts 450k people total 700k state. anc/was/palm area, population consists mostly transplants, people come military service, mining oil work, construction related mining oil general blue collar, mostly low education union jobs (my dad pipeliner back 80s). transplants come Texas oil rich states overwhelmingly conservative. Theres also shitload old boomer rich people move retirement, almost always conservative. frustrating younger generations actually older transplants overwhelm votes much. Many young people move college never come back. real problem here. Sad doesn’t want admit made love one pass away. interest taking vaccine respect viewpoint. lead horse water can't make drink. changes, state health officials need see **low COVID-19 transmission rates, vaccine eligibility children younger 12 and/or research indicating low impact virus children**, Dr. Betsy Tilson, state health director chief medical officer, told North Carolina State Board Education **looking long-term symptoms virus among even people mild cases COVID-19, well increase Type 1 diabetes diagnoses children** correlates high rates COVID-19 good thing acute symptoms tend less children tend spread less,” Tilson said. “That’s we’re supportive in-person school. look risk-benefit ratio, kids class outweighs risk spread infection.” people still believe CNN propaganda?

I guess so. don’t numbers, autoimmune conditions rare impact many women. cancer autoimmune diseases, it’s likely going somewhere 5-10% adults. 

“The National Institutes Health (NIH) estimates approximately 23.5* million Americans live autoimmune disease prevalence rise.

On hand, AARDA says 50* million Americans live autoimmune disease.
(*The NIH includes 24 diseases epidemiology studies considered appropriate prevalence vary greatly range 3% [4.6%] 8% people US autoimmune illnesses—or least 10 million people. ranks fifth, obesity, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, cancer. area live pretty high vaccination rate, company work even higher rate. know one older guy who's vaccinated yet. pretty strong political opinions express much within company probably want alienate everyone else (he's actually good, valuable employee). I've heard talk vaccination, he's waffling. would definitely enough push get vaccinated. us continue wearing masks hate them, wear one 10 hours day. REALLY tired wearing mask, please everyone get vaccinated take thing off!  NY second hit per capita state NJ, like best could reaching herd immunity naturally well. Thanks post, important distinction. Also, viral mutations necessarily mean ""it Coronavirus anymore"". Viruses mutate often, that's thing. ask influenza. Sorry, meant would taken Seattle? bad enough (need brain surgery something) would taken Canada instead. I'm familiar geography would assume Canada would closer level 1 trauma center Alaska Seattle car move inch unless everyone buckled in.

shit, even dog buckled backseat. Yes, virus might need escape local fitness minimum, possible immune system takes care less adapted region. Republicans worried, numbers take nosedive bothered. Howdy Y'all, welcome State Fair Texas. Really? Shocking! Move greek mythology  Ethically legally Small correction, Italy, France Germany (the three largest EU countries) donate ,75 million. remaining 25 million donated EU countries.  Epidemiologic records routinely shared. Anonymously medical records statistically establish risk factors etc. nobody kittens symptom this. Look FL vs NJ today:

Florida: 4.1

New daily cases: 1,878

Tests per 100,000: 189.6

New Jersey: 3.1

New daily cases: 281

Tests per 100,000: 85.9

The gulf cases MUCH greater population difference. someone concerned themselves, absolutely get antibody test. big numbers game though, small percentage people affects largely irrelevant. Next time says something stupid nanochips, point cellphone tell he's willingly carrying ""chip"" around couple years now... multiple studies. believe two linked megacomment. falling since April... Amen Well lot one country, China, accounts one third shots given far. poorer countries shot vaccine China, India, rich western nations get populations. Colorado weird ass place, say least. Logistics Alaska worse Nunavut. Everywhere Nunavut like barrow also island (literally tones barrows less people island), less flights small communities. Alaska year prepare.  personally think herd immunity unlikely happen does, many years 

Also know herd immunity is, since Fauci's emails proven people exposed covid without vaccinated also immunity, probably already hit number

So already herd immunity unlikely ever herd immunity?!

Again incoherent mess - idea you’re saying. you’re cruise ship every passenger vaccinated, you’re controlled enviornment *guarateed* herd immunity! That’s whole point.  Kinda like Mexico ads.  one dose BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, 32 per cent people showed quantifiable antibody response Delta variant, study found. contrast 79 per cent people quantifiable antibody response original strain coronavirus first 25 per cent showed response Beta variant, first emerged South Africa. known exactly level antibodies required protect disease. 

Doesn't sound like Pfizer booster original needed.

The vaccine needs engineered Delta Beta. needs given double, variants covered. 

Sooner rather later. next 6 months, ideally. Curbside online only, wait. kids need shoes!! trying cover ass. town around 70% wrote ""populous"", means ""densely populated"". word want ""populace"", meaning ""the people"". Oh. cat's bag, Fauci pretends want know them? I’m gonna go ahead assume you’re American top disregard doesn’t apply. got covid vaccine months ago bc it’s right thing wanted protect yourself. effects covid may lungs heart even asymptomatic scary af beyond enough reason get shot early possible. 

Dumbasses persuaded joints, beer, donuts welcome join us bandwagon, convictions really worth ~$6 you’re missing crowd. Go pass around soggy communal blunt homies celebrate immunity there’s mask mandate doesn’t mean kid can’t wear mask protect better doesn't. Alaskans mineral rights. written state constitution. That's money. UBI handout, way state constitution set order guarantee Alaskans rights traditionally ours. sad oil mineral rich states citizens, like hate us it. money taken invested stock market get amount proceeds every year, lot money goes state services like roads, schools amenities would normally paid income tax (which have). Im glad people set site constitution put Alaskans first. seems like rest US could take notes. think leading charge fine. LOL, goes people Northeast....I would say 95% people still wear indoors stores I'm get stare wear one still. again, get hit hard think people still super paranoid. educated boomer types also seem paranoid variants.  Same, area super high vaccination rate...still pretty sad though also area highest death rate overall pandemic density help, suppose. wonder unvaccinated people, finally catch COVID gasping air thinking “hmmm, maybe taken vaccine”. Cool insight. wonder Alaska Permanent Fund anything it? Sounds awful lot like UBI dreaded Socialism Quack. Exactly. everyone get vaccine gets much protection even do...that's people able get it, need get it. countries people would love get vaccine, let alone Pfizer Moderna, Americans privilege choice. reason? made date April everything’s improved since then. could possibly changed? cousin also Guillain Barre years ago got vaccine (I think Pfizer?) totally fine. said mask protect person wearing much protect others (common knowledge since forever....)

IIRC, said email mask keep microscopic virus *would* keep tiny little airborne droplets -- knew coronavirus mainly travels within droplets.

A certain group people trying so, hard make big scandal, least talking point try exploit. seems cannot grasp calendar works. calendar says February, much knowledge later year calendar says June July. Especially *novel* virus nobody ever seen before. Lot people = higher density = opportunities spread

2% positive means something different California comparison Wyoming Nope. power inability relinquish trips French Laundry. CEO correct, staff divulged status voluntarily. dont think there's anything debate Polio break require new vaccine rest us every year

Also remember, though, lot people rural communities seriously time logistics make way vaccination site once, let alone twice exactly 4-week interval came see. breakdown percentages factoring eligible vaccines rather total population? logic antibody tests unmasking. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

The rest us living normal lives months.  10% OKs pop covid. Thats pretty small. scaring reason case highlights difficult truth: affluent nations racing vaccinate populations remain vulnerable long coronavirus spreading mutating low- middle-income countries, lack vaccine kept COVID-19 immunization rates low.

New Yorkers need address garbage vaccination rates Bronx Brooklyn stop wasting breath random hick towns like flu measles, though. Getting unlikely protect future variants. We've already seen lots reports reinfections.

**Confirmed** COVID reinfection rare. Well, yes, higher many countries yet sufficient vaccine supply. supply issue United States: Vermont vaccination rate almost double Alabama. happens run Greek letters? Make learn hard way 🤷‍♂️ Also Volunteer state. 
 
*cries* screwed. say otherwise. point comment irrelevant. oof sounds rough What's difference? know attached needle flex pen go jab. COVID-19 vaccine? dealing high turnover business. Small businesses closing shop across country. Amazon Walmart thriving. It’s shame watch. dentist’s office staff wearing masks imagine helps tremendously. Patients still wear whilst waiting. interesting see handled HR 100% make kids wear masks pediatrician’s office. go well visits week later someone cold. Never. Fails. still easily accessible, weekly basis instead daily. 

And even that's true larger level (questionable, imo), cases overall make difference? imagine small portion cruise-goers Floridians.  disagree \*Wonders fast get 3rd booster Oklahoma\* Honestly though much initial infection wonder much acquired immunity going low vax states. excuse cold storage! (bad joke) Fair enough, I'm probably continuing wear allergy reasons either way post-pandemic. already wearing surgical masks regularly warehouse two years covid, kn95s work much better reducing allergies I'm fine looking like idiot indefinite future. 


Or maybe find job I'm horribly allergic to. Literally true tho *Taps head*

Can't COVID admit COVID exists. BS. Florida still averaging cases per day Texas California greater vaccine hesistancy California well. stop daily reporting numbers push narrative everything fine fact state struggling convince large portion population get vaccinated. Ya that’s exactly happened Texas took away mask mandates...wait. Wyoming low population doubt theyll bad. removed restrictions BEGINNING SCHOOL YEAR things closely related. Cruise ships get less public opposition still point easily accessed case levels 44-year-old article probably one jab 22 year-old probably first. Vaccine prevent infection transmission outbreaks going happen. vaccine meant dampen symptoms.

Also aren’t testing people vaxxed finding many people infectious impossible you’re testing government clear countries could moved green amber amber red. People chose ignore warning went away. Nah man. know happen future. Variants.

Small outbreaks. costly. Still lots unvaccinated people.

A test small cost. town already tested everyone. Sure can. Dealing high turnover costs lot paying competitive wage. yet they’ll actually riding backs people get vaccinated covid never ever hits vaccine uptake exceed 70% title talk clubbing show picture open air market? Testing quarantine full vaccination recommended real. create qualifier? region, should. per Bloomberg, current rate 37M doses per day. 8.7 billions doses left vaccinate 70% world's population (15.4 billions x 70% - 2 billions), that's 235 days left 7 months ~3 weeks. I'm sorry Ben supposed billion? = a^x (where y: number doses produced month a: number doses produced last month)

Between December June, value x 1 &lt; x &lt; 2 Shots shots. make sense trying vaccinate people already covid. Since reinfection rate breakthrough infection rate vaccinated people. yes, living without face punishment lot lessons learned covid pandemic 
Unfortunately like book never opened, may know valuable create book scratch. possibility/likelihood even vaccines becoming available including one's much cheaper produce. would everyone react pandemic ends without world vaccinated. clear. happens cases deaths drop minimal levels people go back normal living? still push vaccinate? There’s little chance engineered lab:

“If someone seeking engineer new coronavirus pathogen, would constructed backbone virus known cause illness”

Also, aren’t foolproof, labs strong safety procedures 

 “The evidence people lab leak lab Wuhan.” place like Texas (which looks low here), cities meaningful. live one top 3 vaccinated counties state haven’t new cases week imagine getting point covid infects 50 million (in US), kills 60 thousand, I'd say we've ""beat"" it.

&amp;#x200B;

we yet lockdown flu

&amp;#x200B;

**Past Seasons Estimated Influenza Disease Burden**   Holy fucking shit I'm misunderstanding you, mutations correlate directly many cases are. slow see fewer variants emerging.

If look carefully VoC appeared shallows sparked new waves. ""13bn go"" there's CanSino J&amp;J 1 dose look Israel, vaccinating 60% population reach herd immunity, I'd say 7 bn go. cynicism opines 6 months vaccination roll out, course going wealthier nations received doses.

I'm sure makes sense China produced doses far India close (if ahead of) US Finally, part really know anything about, chance better vaccines developed perhaps require cold chain infrastructure? imagine that's one biggest challenges developing nations.

AFAIK that's mRNA vaccines require extreme cold environment. [Everything requires normal refrigeration. 

However, vaccines looked effective mRNA prevent infection, they're great option reduce severe symptoms mortality. mean say Easter. going egg face Easter 2022 comes covid-19 gone. doubt it'll work hard core anti vax idiot might enough slightly hesitant.

I would love see huge uptake vaccine among everyone doubt it'll happen without external pressure. would compulsory vaccination want see images police holding people they're vaccinated. would like see people miss make choice get vaccinated. Ideas like curtailing travel availability unvaccinated, ""if want come country tourism either vaccinated spend two weeks mandatory quarantine also travel insurance cover cost covid related costs (medical care, track trace quarantine travel companions)"" sure study university going zoom college unless show proof vaccination.""

Other ideas include non inclusion state benefits.

Youre bad Infrastructure complex cold vaccines need stored Yeah, China 20M+ per day that's India target Come Monday

Wait - decision due soon??? 28% fully vaccinated 2-3 weeks ago

Hi, sorry keep correcting you, again, slightly mark info. UK fully vaxxed 3 weeks ago, fully vaxxed 2 weeks ago.  ones seem trying hardest remain uneducated

Society microcosm. believe still 12 year age minimum getting vaccine. It’s common, young children died COVID. 

We’re yet point “everyone wants it” get it. putting vaccines mind control like conspiracy theorists claim? No. kind technology nonexistent.  got first dose today, really happy, finally! Btw reason go US allow now. slow partially due reallocation (eg look Ottawa). 😂😂 man talks long term side effects mrna vaccine (technology thats used ebola influenza past) contracting covid actually proven organ damage lung primarily sometimes brain

I cite cuz already known amirite 😕🙄😂😊😔👀 Well yeah learned damn stupid Americans really are. I'm American. That’s unusual. decide want booster fall, get Pfizer. due respect, implying anti-Vaxers stereotypical right leaning conservatives… reality many ultra liberal “hippie” also anti-vax well.  Looks like might go 100000 cases/week tomorrow, per Worldometers.  current -34% average week week holds. 
 would first time since went clarify - go essential stores. that's grocery stores - example, includes optical stores.

You cannot go non-essential stores. hope so. sleep last night spent whole morning glued bed. Got almost fell over. 

I'm sure tomorrow I'll alright means issues present would also studied starting then. explanation included QUESTION. Miss 😕. Education expensive, might wanna invest predict, Americans vaccinated, new Covid vaccine development drop zero.

The US developed 1 vaccine: Moderna. Pfizer producing vaccine developed Germany J&amp;J vaccine developed Netherlands.

[And there's literally dozen vaccines developed Russia They'll also insist causes made diseases ""do research"" (watch Youtube conspiracy videos) Political pressure factor, sure. However bigger problem Americans individualistic want want want NOW. value freedom individual collective wellbeing.  less people getting sick since they're vaccinated, would reason get tested  Lived 20 years- idk additional research could convince Florida government way trustworthy. problem suddenly population became 100% vaccinated not. 

It’s like people trying say COVID don’t need wear masks. 

There evidence vaccinated people still spread unvaccinated people. “science” isn’t confident think dependent honest population, have. So, like, vaccines work? CDC doesn’t issue EUA. mean FDA, think. known tho... didnt even cite sources back claim.

However, Pfizer/BioNTech seems delivery issues next weeks, fixed compensated doses later, could get additional delays - still done way October.

I’ve looking something like that. find interesting differences showing. wonder it’s strategy standpoint (relying certain vaccines didn’t deliver much example) vaccine hesitancy. 

Belgium’s rate currently 53% 25.5% adult population almost 93% 65+ 1st dose. Flanders (the biggest region accounting 58% total Belgian populating) even 97.6% 65+. yes we’re mostly using Pfizer ones largely available. personally know people got Pfizer (and one scheduled moderna).

This particularly odd. Comparing pandemics advent modern medicine knowledge warfare good comparison.

Today, knew virus spread yet let kept spreading good portion world refused believe science. science created internet, cars, phones, cancer fighting medicine everything else modern world. 

That's problem. people follow rules believe science. President also downplayed use masks political reasons mislead lied people every opportunity actually disbanded world class pandemic response team fall 2019. 

That's many deaths preventable. PASSPORTS  make sense me. could prevent kind wall. Yet one tell brands vaccines received past.  %100 new thing born purely media fear peddling. Yesterday marked end pandemic personally.

Went event new city (far progressive I'm from, needs added), next nobody wore masks outside. people wore indoors. never realized much missed seeing people's faces. finally feel weight lifting shoulders. depends kind vaccine use. vaccine low efficacy take lot people reach herd immunity. Israel using Pfizer one effective vaccines. Israel’s cases dropped early. Like someone else said natural immunity isn’t robust vaccine. Brazil variant shows you’re 15 years old living somewhere shots 18+ Flu shots don’t produce nearly immune response things.

For adults, that’s thing get regularly enough compare to. one needs boosters TDaP that’s every 10 years (and I’m guessing people don’t bother it). No. heard CEO hospital interview say June 7 comply they’ll put unpaid leave two weeks. 2 weeks they’re employment terminated compliance.

It’s interesting interview one plaintiffs slandering hospital admin saying they’re hiding cases vaccine injury kinds crazy nonsense.

I’m 100% sure lawyer would want discussing case interview like legal chance winning. They’re trying (and likely failing) win public opinion hoping settlement point would be? Sorry dont buy response. Well thought pharmacies grocery stores open, don’t really count optician shops shopping. Even hardware stores closed in-person shopping huge issue emergency house. Hopefully wealthier nations preparing this. We'll need huge teams NGO people go remote cities villages reach everyone. Doctors Without Borders, Red Cross, maybe coordinated UN mission.

And remote areas dangerous, difficult achieve nations. And, course, dealing vax hesitancy refusal confound efforts.

Australia pretty lucky cases explode country don’t push vaccination influenza 1918 SARS MERS pandemics ended. one hasn’t ended yet, right it’s important encourage vaccination. Wonderful news. wish mask mandates lower % would stay place (I'm Vegas went 100% &amp; mask vaccinated, 95% people see longer wearing masks). reading differences Irish colonialism colonialism West East Africa. maybe re-evaluate opinion matter come back make informed comment. Honestly, state, one cautious states managing pandemic (as still fully reopened, plan soon) moves daily reports weekly reports, feel like we're really turning corner thing. Well instead thinking like cost person think like avoiding cost ongoing pandemic. many trillion governments spent relief citizens cost vaccinating world would far lower still expensive far lower. schools, workplaces too. It’s place people spend long periods time near Red vs. Blue.  lucky get 70% That's fair, misrepresentative say ""have able go store.""

There *are* countries kinds restrictions, one them. Exactly, testing widely available. People need tested rate before. got Moderna shot yesterday! look forward second one :) Let’s get one first lady….there’s time everything right it’s time recover  cases drop, less incentive people (who high risk categories) get vaccinated too.   hope stop comparing deaths caused war deaths caused disease soon. completely meaningless comparison.

Deaths pandemics compared *other pandemics and/or outbreaks*; death wars compared wars. *glorified data entry kids even unlikely get even even unlikely die it. sure got many downvotes? cited scientists saying efficacy quoted something article… find information? using Economist check excess death time countries fraction deaths per capita. CDC found single case someone vaccinated passing virus current recommendation fully vaccinated longer need wear masks. Yes less effective 94-95 percent still highly effective.

Mind Governor blamed 2020 summer surge press reporting covid enough. data show indeed Delta variant, Alpha (B.1.17) continues fall Delta exponentially increasing. re-opening certainly played role, trend reversal probably happened Delta variant. I'm thinking UK buried school transmission data.

And CDC changed mask policy seeing increase hospitalizations among children.

I wish folks went beyond protect cannot vaccinate yet  Texas vaccinate whether person documented not. close ties living south border also quietly vaccinating anyone comes across. I’m willing bet NM, AZ, CA also this. pandemic need work together.  1. criticizing way people world powers tend assume smaller entities neccessarily pick side ideology rather simply desire survive, opinions negatively shapes people countries.

2. asked. (As I, someone latin american said simply understand like powers). CDC director access CDC data showing teen hospitalizations dramatically dropped Thank input. hope remain well. you? think simply moved daily reports weekly bundles. I’m Florida, company continuing require masks unless show proof full vaccination. Since Florida, lot unvaccinated people here. Honestly typical anti vaxxers.  people 20s 30s think need really care spreading it.  isn’t problem opinion. possible covid cases lasted less 24 hours colds. vaccination center, that's sure. set priority.

Obviously might ""Bermuda triangle"", know fact (my wife medical doctor), say willing take shot AZ, get vaccinated anywhere NRW within span two weeks. work place gave $100 everyone reports if/when got vaccine. also moved vaccinated people don’t wear masks week cdc update. Everyone normally interact maskless vaccinated masked reach fully vaccinated status. It’s really nice. 1.	Newsom didn’t make decision
2.	This makes bad guy isn’t employer 

When people subreddit become weenies wearing masks? Geeze. European countries bit 2nd doses first doses yes. Germany still almost 300K first doses yesterday, still impressive. Netherlands wait get first dose currently 2 weeks bad. it’s like wearing bra. Mildly uncomfortable mostly necessary public work. I’ve 30 odd years, handle mask longer.

I’ve fully vaccinated since early April workplace Full thousands unvaccinated unmasked kids idiot unmasked unvaccinated adults we’ll masked long time. wear remind covid still exists, reduce small chance I’ll catch myself. wouldn’t kill I’m vaccinated, enough immune system issues want reduce risk far possible covid plagues visitors pass staff.

Plus Love visitors tell smile. Never retail worker.

Most coworkers vaccinated vaccinated coworkers choosing stay masked. least one unvaccinated staff person isn’t exposes hundred kids day herself. I’ve become apathetic. kids parents won’t even put mask crowded building can’t scrape sympathy kids coworker get sick.

It took 2 hours stabilize SARS-COV-2 spike protein similar SARS one could apply work SARS.

Back then, diagnosed automatic death sentence. I’m glad progress medicine made possible people like live relatively normal life. Thank input. I’ve already covid (natural immunity) lost baby last year. I’m less risk people possibility losing another baby isn’t worth it. I’m listening doctor, CDC manufacturers yet complete trials, wrong past. Stories like make us wish prioritized little earlier, right? Yikes! correct! China still shipping vaccines vaccinating population staggering rate btw.

i know country still getting getting doses, life saver we're longer getting AZ's j&amp;j still deliver single dose. friend 50 yo. take shot. several waiting lists. far told chance. brother Prio 3. Also still Chance. Also prepared take anything. Germany? too, extremely, ridiculously rare (right now). helps remind awful stuff happens people statistically likely never worried about. birth control pills literally decades never worried blood clots, example. “Live free die” Officially anyways. doubt honesty countries. Sadly so. Everyone loves hating Florida Yes. Shoes pillows. I’m waiting get back stores. think giving vaccine young people first would've better idea. They're ones often forced work midst pandemic. vaccinated first cases would plummeted zero COVID would achieved, restrictions lifted.  course totally right. think lot people forget damage delayed care do. Hopefully NHS cope level hospitalizations someone who’s overdue NHS waiting list (and elective surgery either) … I’m actually super happy rapidly opening everything despite surge delta variant Lets hope pass humans. Netherlands far vaccinated less people Germany. Germany ppl 50 still little chance get shot. guys different demographics? practical solution. Many Kids don’t wear masks properly begin with, aren’t given option vaccine, aren’t affected virus large. 

This creates system kids mask everyone else doesn’t. result helps one. Vaccinated people safe unvaccinated kids already safe. get that, that's something that's new changing this. Teens.

Let’s forget serious medical reactions vaccine adults. good friend blood clotting, nasal bleeding hospitalized vaccine. don’t see reported press. Good point. People cars wear seat belts get accident don’t waste tax dollars paying first responders scrape dumb asses pavement, could responding emergencies. Funny personal decision still screws rest us. virus doesn’t really affect kids significantly. may vectors elderly vaccinated adults eligible receive vaccine, good masking kids? thought ""follow science""  science. know.... gal work with, AFAIK immunocompromised late 20s fit, covid last summer, got vaccine February got Covid back April. teachers young usually, non masked kiddos.

The Australian government informed Quantas expect open country travel *2024*. making concerted effort vaccinate wide basis seem content let nation kept prisoner next three years, let overseas citizens languish long unless cough thousands upon thousands pay quarantine absurdly priced (as $14k) rare flights.

Well CRISPR tool. actually use eliminate disease, need understand disease genomic level well enough even know fix. bigger problem tool itself, although definitely many low hanging fruits diseases known caused single well characterized mutations, far minority diseases. solve majority diseases require thousands less flashy innovations. still even know half genes E. coli Saccharomyces cerevisiae do. agree wins molecular biology tool millenium, funny can't even use effectively day-to-day older shit better many organisms never got attention. seems disagreement facts NYT article NPR interview, two sources high quality. possible measuring slightly different things.

No.There disagreement: One stating facts, one stirring hysteria (based facts) :-(
Even, hospitalization risk 2-3x higher Covid Flu, still negligible risk. (204 hospitalized course 4 months deaths whole US!)

Original CDC report: mortality stats age (to illustrate risk levels): contributing &lt;1% overall mortality 0-17 age group). wrong media, case simply reporting PHE saying, could well correct. However, quote states ""The majority vaccinated,"". changes nothing; need continue vaccinating people overwhelm local hospitals. far there's evidence happening hotspots either. Either billionaire bedridden.

yeah since then. would put CRISPR, similar tool (whatever emerges) bigger deal mRNA vaccines. really potential radically change nature human species. We’re already seeing case rate among unvaccinated remain static (or go up) state—even overall case rate plummets.

New Zealand worry citizens neighboring countries illegally crossing border causing outbreaks. example, Canadian government determined significant cause COVID cases Canada people crossing US-Canada border, despite fact border supposed closed Forgive I'm Captain Obvious, Mr Bolton's ancestors Bolton itself. imagine we'll get within weeks.

Yes, also need invest schools’ ventilation federal level, I’m saying need look big picture nibble edges problem That's really works. Mutations chance occurring every time virus replicates. takes notice variants requires genomic testing, establishing actually contagious strains (can observed proportion tests turn variant increasing time), etc. virus know many active cases outside host replication carries exactly same.

Disease deaths high rarely compared war deaths reason. Excess deaths per capita.

I’d argue 100k might’ve good though I’d love to, preschool shut several times outbreaks among kids. aren’t going back cases almost zero vaccine approved toddlers.

There 221 million reddit users US. next Country Australia 17 million. India 13 million. starts significantly dropping that. even compare.

Every time see criticism like mind-numbingly idiotic. Respect Natural immunity? basing on? us first half, I’m gonna lie 1) pandemic preventable. multitude preventable errors. 

2) trivializing 600,000 deaths. 

3) Malaria local problem 85% cases Sub-Sahara Africa. Also, considerable effort done figure get virus control. make seem like world care Malaria. 

4) 600,000 dead Americans top deaths. 600,000. think actually realizing many people could still today handled better. 

5) Heart disease contagious. Also, billions spent yearly figure out. Again, acting like accept heart disease actively try figure out.

Wow, great point…. 2021. multiple televisions. Totally agree. many places outside air far clean. full pollutants allergens. Deaths war commonplace compared deaths disease, point. 

No one looks 30k flu deaths year says “that’s half soldiers killed Vietnam year”. 

If compared figures you’d massive number people dying disease tiny number people dying war. 

Again 400k people die malaria per year, mostly Africa. massive amount people die single year. one war killed many people year year would extremely destructive. India: one? may possible deanonymize information number researchers small. Actually opposite. It’s tool quickly develop deploy antibodies narrowly targets cancer pathogen want destroy. speed narrow target key. say ""California"" whole, rather pressure unions who're over-cautious, minority advocacy groups who're untenable position trying protect under-vaccinated black &amp; brown communities world around re-opens. complex issue hesitancy communities rooted mistrust Western medicine, history deception Anglo state leaders &amp; even toxic masculinity. We've 600k deaths already. bunch anti-maskers thought get died it. 

Nothing absolute, we've reduced rate infection deaths thanks people took vaccine. entire population idiots none took it... still shitty situation before.

Can collectively refund Florida back Spain??? 88% effectiveness symptomatic disease caused B.1.617.2 variant, versus 93%

5%, 5X. lol ""What take vaccinate world?""

A whole host civil wars would imagine population 15billion? never flu, flu, hopefully added flu shot road, maybe confusion realized people. “Yes” -Common sense argument science, argument morality. OK force risk, hard quantify much greater 0, children, even decline force adults take simple precautions would lower risk everyone. vanished many dreaded diseases though ""mandatory"" vaccination programs. know protect children it. Nobody forced vaccinate threatened don’t. Many employers providing rewards employees though several states drawing millions dollars though. “encourage” right word.  coincidence ^/s  guesswork, that's disputed. simply know. able work live life normally six months due illness quite impact.

There's speculation chronic fatigue syndrome see huge uptick pandemic immune issues caused viruses may cause it. That's insignificant thing either.

I'm suggesting data points possibility longer term yet unknown impacts may diminish one's quality life later on. Especially prevalent long lasting post viral syndrome (even ""only six months""). much prevalent we've seen respiratory viruses know about. suggestive, though conclusive.

None us see future. pandemic similar impact society 1918 flu, look forward lifetime outbreaks many millions dead years come. Ontario, Canada still allow outdoor/indoor dining, movie theatres, shops, museums, art galleries, offices open. What's opposite slippery slope? escalator lifts everybody up? Punishment stupidity anyway...  also get outsized representation use gleefully obstruct necessary infrastructure. You’re right. Sorry backing source. someone find one provide one remove comment? point teacher NY wanted vaccine chance get it.

...sorry surprised see Florida tbh. Every headline like makes want driverless cars more. year ago: “I REFUSE LIVE LIFE FEAR!”

Now: “NO WAY AINT TAKIN VACCINE DONT TRUST IT”

Cmon bro scared now?  Without line thinking people lacked mental capacity would left die number reasons. We're talking abortions, sterilizations, torturing abusing people, we're talking protecting lives people lack mental capacity make decisions take actions necessary survival.

Otherwise humanity dies generation making sure babies need survive = forced abortion/sterilization. fine. point stop reported everyday. could even go one step say potentially get covid, us vaccinated asymptomatic mild cases. agree, thankful UK right collective point view. Selfishly/for personal safety, bit jealous friends US. know sub much post-pandemic/optimistic mood right now, feel fully comfortable I've gotten jab myself. arent yet though Nope, I’m totally wrong.  Vermont is, terms total population. anyone else tired hearing Fauci never said that. SNL. get wrong love Sarah Palin never said it. 

She said, see Russia Alaska. work retail talk day long wearing mask, 9 hours day. It’s really problem project voice bit. It’s people I’m talking soft voice makes tough sometimes. honestly don’t issue often, people understand need speak heard. Lol, I’m glad company following CDCs guidelines. want passing virus trip planned. virus kills people causes organ damage. He's willing roll dice. every single person passed virus half million dead. can't stop people. like spend time them. respect decision get vaccine. people respect it. don't. ""The rest?"" Alaska considered red-hick state. Palin help Alaska's reputation. hospital stakeholders believe it’s best interest hospital employees aren’t risk catching spreading Covid vaccination it’s absolutely prerogative hospital create mandate. 

I know opinion disagree courts may also. Corporations carte blanche order medical treatments \*they\* decide ""in best interest"" business.  

In mind absurd company require abortions no-brainer order vaccines, fortunately set labor laws sit Supreme Court, line between?  illnesses give right order vaccines? COVID? next big virus? flu? happens long-term studies show COVID vaccines cause serious side effects?

Oh wow. Tell kids died P1 variant. Half team Louisiana *HOSPITAL* work at, planning getting vaccine. high risk (obese, old, respiratory issues). office overlooks loading dock watched 330 fellow humans, died covid, get loaded hearses. makes brain hurt. We've access pfizer vaccine since last December, got mine. committed someone asks question presupposes something proven accepted people involved.

So short answer- know use reddit. use google.

And yes- regardless- get vaccine even previously infected. Feel free google that. Outbreaks rural communities continue probably indefinitely.

It like polio, 90% vaccination rate, rural communities United States still getting 20 years later. Lol saw typo percent positive cases vaccinated people? Fixed Right? 


I've seen skyrocket, too. Rarer, though.  virus remains threat them... everyone else wear them. yes. That's much better alternative. actually make everyone use wheelchairs one person argument. Arkansan checking in, unvaccinated people decided gathering public without masks A-Okay mandates lifted. Never mind they're supposed lifted people got vaccine. pretty disappointing knowing people flat dont care actions hurt long slightly inconvenienced  see stats number people currently still getting regularly tested comparison positive tests? good resource this? probably work requires talking. know someone advised doctor get vaccines developing severe autoimmune disease following MMR shot kid. thoughts folks sort category? wish comment top mean name doesnt really matter. good matter called. that's company refuses go back offices. point going back endless obstacles.

It's matter opinion anecdote simple fact. Same, nothing since April 2017 can't get 5G. /s too, enjoy silver ;) 
Very happy :p 4th - 179.7 - 67.5%

That number seem right. 179.7 high. 67.5% seems right (174.2). Lol resigns, fly away, lives like king! much lottery? sources back saying? seen data prove that. number gross underrepresentation it’s much higher. also won’t know true toll ever likely approximation close 5-10 years. Thanks response, though asked citations studies. sources? know vaccine reported much better outcomes disease itself, people got vaccine available. choosing vaccine covid, deciding trusting natural antibodies getting vaccine. Genuine question- concern friend consider safe?  quotes used friend let go 20+ years anti vaxxer covid conspiracy theorist. went dug became became living reality. didn’t matter said, always , “we see things differently.” No, believe demonstrably true facts. believe feeeeeeeeeeel. Pulling name twice would even comical  It’s probably months

two weeks flatten curve Real question: know 3/30? ask that's pretty significantly lower pretty much every low-vaccination area. suspect possible rate pretty low also willing share they've vaccinated. hell tean? completely OK taking care seniors others social security.  

But say don’t get vaccine (by choice) pay COVID hospital bill!!! That's pretty horrifying take. 

""Lacking mental capacity"" seems mean ""not agreeing you"". actually systems place medical power attorney people *actually* unable make medical decisions themselves, disagreeing medical advice certainly enough meet bar. might sound nice moment common medical advice disagrees something *you* want, assure probably again. Depending state live in, ask physician retail pharmacist. speak Ohio that’s state work in. Ohio state vaccine registry required report to.  Covid cover ups?  right cultural. Indian friends in/know many generational homes parents norm  think difference receptionists wearing one, doctor wears one consults hallways, hygenists wear one panoramic xray, etc... 100% time now. saw commercial saying vacate Alaska one highest vaccinated rates. It’s 600000 measures taken.

It would much worse measures taken.

It could much better USA competent president then. No, it’s extremely unlikely variant shows completely vaccine resistant. 

Also, Florida’s first dose rate isn’t bad, 50.8% people gotten first dose, it’s even higher adults. Vaccine hesitancy = morons Yes, vaccines excellent everyone avail (in opinion). situations masks certainly help protection. Concerned much emphasis placed reaching 70% vaccinated rate. Last heard CDC epidemiologists idea % rate immunity necessary stop Covid public health threat; earlier speculated 80% would necessary. country reaches 70% concerned lots hesitant unconcerned people sit back. CDC etc says need 80 90% vaccinated that's going cause hesitancy backlash. 70% clearly set step, end point.  However part believes need make sure protect truly cannot vaccinated

Thank you. many fail realize this. someone likely cannot get booster due complications first two shots really need country hit herd immunity early 2022. ... Eugenics? Good luck convincing anyone accept solution Agreed. people can’t vaccinated, masks certainly helpful. bullshit

What on?

ON people ICU *ever* third wave (after seniors mostly vaccinated) ever - hell, *double* previous peak.

It's terms percentages, also terms pure absolute numbers. They're specifically talking 18+

Lots stats show eligible population 12+ brings % Jesus fucking christ. How?! I'm asking relates cruise issue, proving vaccination status, ""all reasons"". 

I also really see issue transparency. They're still reporting, less frequently. worst part think *might* take bit longer see increase one, pretty much everyone uses 7 day averages determine anyway daily variations. Potatoes grow dirt, silly.

Also snow much live. Im largest temperate rainforest North america. second shot yesterday, earliest possible state. slightly miserable today. go.  nobody idea talking about.

Because new convention. month old hat. heard potato's grow snow! Saskatchewan still going age, unless you’re high risk. Lifting mask mandates schools reach vaccination threshold (or even requiring unvaccinated people continue wear masks) would useful incentive get young people vaccinated...not mention mask use among unvaccinated people still heavily suggested.

There definitely parents considering vaccinations kids ""get back normal."" skip vaccine...

The NYS health department Cuomo making incredibly poor choice here. Like said, think probably say soon, think reasonable say getting point. surprise Florida first, others follow. states well 70% vaccination rate right now, another outbreak happen states, would worry virus mutating degree current vaccines work it?

Cause live Florida right vaccination rate 40%. Definitely happen. Almost certainly happen June 21 Astoria, still bring masks us wear indoors point us accustomed anything. wear outside.  course done case practical purposes.../s 

Most Florida sub 50% vaccination rates. seem pretty confident \~50%. [Yes, that’s whole group also said data another database -Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) - show rates myocarditis pericarditis COVID-19 vaccination differed expectations.

Shocking! love idea smaller prize amounts winners.  anymore, Newsom pushing back 6/15 reopen CalOSHA passed indefinite mask mandate workplaces No, actually. pockets science deniers everywhere, unfortunately.  Weird flex Even though COVID isn’t yet, it’s nice point know we’re going suddenly massive spike every holiday like last year.

Shouldn't added vaccinated %? NNN said Africa invincible take HCQ…

There many vaccines also paid still haven’t approved, others failed, paid spooled like moderna extent Pfizer.

Without early risky investment vaccines wouldn’t now, neither would production capacity.

And again, one going scramble capital, know how, materials, construction duplicate vaccines meaningful amount time pandemic.

It took US full year, basically blank check complete mastery tech make vaccine production capacity, simply cannot replicated, even India homegrown vaccine using much less advanced tech cannot stand capacity needed.

India authorized J&amp;J vaccine internal use, export US bearing internal use, sure private companies country export AZ vaccine poor countries, talking 66m doses year, nearly amount vaccines US sent India yet approve AZ.

And again, none would US didn’t fund all. wealth power can’t harnessed good isn’t sustained, absolutely put oxygen mask helping others, give away billion doses vaccine next year.

A billion plus doses given away free, country wants them, including paying India make huge portion those.

Do American citizens matter Indian citizens. No, ones funding everything. ones keeping China Russia exerting really awful influence, ones getting slaughtered CoVID still day death rate that’s far removed India’s, yes would get first dibs.

What mean loosened India’s restrictions export, exporting, vast majority wasn’t US.

Reallocate budget spending? would cut, DoD? aware DoD shored failing hospitals full year, two ships weeks thousands doctors nurses across country, DoD bought distributed vaccines, DoD developed one vaccines, DoD manning vaccination sites, DoD makes everything else possible anyways? really bad countries make admittedly imperfect actions US look right saintly power checked stony military.

Again, fire here, put out, fighting fires, country planet would differently.

We exporting vaccines civilians April, exporting vaccines strategic allies December countries could also maintain armed forces (China Russia vaccinated military phase 3 vaccines).

I see person meaningful discussion trying point flaws other’s arguments instead point things might aware of, truth whole thing massive well beyond ability one person lizard brains understand all.

Likewise hope don’t see bashing you, pointing difference ideals realities. That’s largely due ingrained mindset perfect always enemy good, I’ll take good forever delayed perfect later every time.

Absolutely help everyone, response perfect, think overly critical US did.

The AZ released months ago, production outstripped demand approved vaccines sent away, that.

I’m absolutely biased, wife one working 80 hour weeks recently ICU doc, many friends time medical school military doctors (as vet fell schools military interest group even though wasn’t medical school, great social outlet though made great friends) fighting covid around world somehow never get reported on. Haha. That’s funny think about. 

“We really need get people vaccinated save lives. give instruments death?” vaccine norovirus ever? mom really susceptible gets every year. sure would like one it! Colonialism 70 years certainly fucked every country impacted, would someone try argue contrary?

No one's arguing colonialism fucked every country colonized. What's argued long takes get rid remnants colonialism.  gets people talking gives fun softer (maybe shotgun) feel it. It’s much psychological shift people’s thinking getting want win stuff. zaniest prizes think of. would surprised hit 50% fair, would get another dose free beer. Good beer though, like ipas. missing another subset people: want vaccine can’t due medical reasons. people rely rest us get vaccinated thus keep can’t safe.  Maybe true Munich, doubt somehow. live close Pfaffenhofen still waiting first dose. wife colleagues (~20 ppl know personally). Munich.

Forgot mention: group 4, 30 40 years old makes difference. America value human life else. chance better vaccines developed

Where's financial incentive?

I predict, Americans vaccinated, new Covid vaccine development drop zero. I'm hard time hearing people around people. long time since I've focus voice one person surrounded people talking! Good you.

I fully expect area bring back mandates, however. ones government leaders either try ignore and/or downplay pandemic think good re-election chances, turn pandemic culture war thing make solid public health practices something ignore “stick libs”. 

So, - answer question. diseases political failures it’s actually pretty easy straightforward avoid become political failures. dose 1 went away. that's even thinking logistics distribution administration vaccines. Okay thanks could read article Sub  get subscription one medevac companies (ranging 50-125 month) covers copay, insurance. don’t, flight Juneau Seattle costs upwards 100k Oh shit, typo booster another booster. Yeah that's difficult, imagine 3 UNvaccinated people, would feel immense pressure. West Virginia, think. Guns, iirc. includes things like clothing shoe stores almost three months getting pretty annoying.

Edit: I’m pro lockdowns necessary. city million people 29 cases today. It’s necessary more! Pandemics rare comparison though. last time pandemic comparable severity happened 100 years ago, whereas deaths war commonplace. Nobody thinks Spanish flu extent think wars, comparison fine imo So, understand correctly, suggesting colonialism, Burundi would vaccinated due ability distribute rollout vaccines within 12 months? Alabama. Last heard, Alabama Mississippi *the* lowest vaccination rates 50 states. people like cannot vaccine altogether?

Will forced wear till drop? Sorry ty, put nearly 2 years gotta point draw line seems way. bit slap face Russians they're getting vaccine, especially deaths much higher reported.  lucky. NRW example give first doses vaccination centers least middle month, vaccines needed second doses. doctor practices long waiting lists. teenagers 12-15 years old allowed get anything Biontech right now. 

Personally also think can't blame people rather want Biontech Moderna. STIKO (the official vaccine commmission Germany) federal ministry health recommend Astrazeneca J&amp;J people 60 years older. younger people could still get longer talk doctor personal weighing risk factors, many people feel skeptical vaccines STIKO federal ministry health recommend people 60 years old surprise. Younger women especially valid reason skeptical group often suffered negative effects Astrazeneca J&amp;J vaccination. really aren’t big enough population centers north Vancouver warrant level 1. level 1 Canada’s west coast Vancouver, then, it’s easier fly 15 minutes deal immigration Wait tomorrow. think much better position handling next pandemic. made tons improvements society current pandemic. utilized modern tech part population successfully use remote/hybrid working model. still able teach (effectiveness still concern) stop. able (relatively) quickly develop tests, vaccines, utilize MRNA bio technology.

Anything annoyance, can't believe, I'm sorry. mask, suffocating.  numbers spouting nothing teens. Nothing all. Teens get sick die disease. hospital capable dealing massive trauma

We do. Level 2 centers essentially level 1, fewer specialized surgeons hand 24/7. Considering population density, don’t really need that. like think like I've gotten two shots great I'm protected everyone earth access risk covid still exists perhaps dangerous personally people around life I'm looking forward able enjoy again. nephew's live side globe can't see everyone vaccinated.

And we'll never truly know full extent. best stay safe encourage every person know vaccine available get soon possible.  Read real stats. 200 hospitalized, non died. article bec newly released age groups need try scare parents. open air market people getting infected. divided weak. architects empires architects collapse.

I think CDC reporting 6-7 cases myocarditis teen males 16, resolved within 1 week. Reading comment, understand also right elderly, ofc need vaccine reason. 
Pfizer seems like lowest risk (that's one prefer giving fragile subjects, least Italy), already read trombosis cases johnson-johnson.

But wanted express point view. 
Why overprotective parents scared? mean offense

I know 40-50 year olds took covid left children alone. optimal age+not perfect lifestyle+a virus discover artificial (mainstream media leaking scroll phone, know much it, tbh 21th century black plague always seemed weird me)+no vaccine=potential death

In words worry toddler, imo. 

Vaccine+20 year old keto, takes supplements wants left alone=Annoying. 
I scared vaccine covid, thought forced take drug. 

Where's problem at-risk subjects covered? 
Then decide risk whatever want affect people. even country seems like we've coming close. understand fuzz vaccinating 12 year olds now. 

We combat asymptomatic spread vaccinating people risk, also risk trasmitting more. Yes youthful recklessness forgot think immunocompromised, guess right, feels like possibility spreading covid low. presymptomatic gives covid, makes asymptomatic therefore unable give covid. 

I know, there's possibility everything, could die tomorrow driving, small percentages always relevant. valid also, get vaccinated. sad truth way pandemics controlled America control get America. Actually haven’t seen increase it, also it’s caused viruses. might linked, might not.

Why bother protective equipment job? gets way work I’m careful person!

It’s frustrating. Especially see mask mandates nearly eliminated flu common cold year. 

Does two months masking indoors getting sick really seem like sacrifice? 

Especially schoolchildren. Jesus Christ, schools cesspools viral transmission parents protesting mask mandates unvaccinated children. Shots truck nuts! 5x’s worse accurate. NH's offer comes three months late. vaccine shortage February, Canada secured 2.5-3M doses week Pfizer next 3 months. 

This enough give second shots 75% 12+ population late August 400,000/day rate we've sustained last 5-6 weeks. suppose there’s small chance someone might vaccinated uncomfortable sharing information HR.

Does seem fairly unlikely though. ...because took us much longer get vaccination going satisfying rate. California shithole. compare SF us south LA night &amp; day Bay area gentrification steroids working poor blue collar neighborhoods left. Like said, covid’s yearly mortality shutdowns, social distancing, masking. That’s changing now. 

I said still learning long terms effects, definitely causes it. It’s enough concern get investigate it. 

I clearly said shouldn’t stop society. Masking indoors grocery stores harmless. personally don’t think outdoor summer camp activities require masks. Uk Russia Brazil they’re also producing vaccines. Australia think low capacity.  get UK reentry frustrating, that, producing negative tests takes 15 minutes day. people love traveling haven’t able year, that’s nothing. Reality covid never going control US. Let's honest here, handful countries actually got covid control tended either islands smaller populations (like New Zealand) dictatorships (like China). US neither. US option basically blocking anyone entering country restricting travel within country definitely got away snatching people street throwing hospitals whether wanted not. Covid never going control US. we're brutally honest here, even Trump come said Covid big deal day one supported restrictions know **STILL** conspiracy nutjobs US would've said completely fake made restrictions part government plan control us. people shitting southern states 35% one still bigger country stand corrected.

First, I’m happy vaccinated continue vaccinated. think it’s important open honest it’s lonely concerning ride far. 

I took first Pfizer shot morning, end day break bleeding two weeks period scheduled start. never happened entire life. spotting two weeks, “real” (red painful) period.

I went GYN, said it’s true disrupted immune system, didn’t much say vaccine itself. exam, said saw inflammation, took swab bacteria test (negative). said could caused whole host things (some scary), needed track period 3 months establish pattern. period related discharge 7 days 3 months row, I’d need ultrasound. 

This third month, everything appears ok far. Month 1 first Pfizer (total shit show). Month 2 little longer normal. Month 3 appears normal range. 

My second Pfizer vaccine didn’t this, though get slight fever next day. 🤷‍♀️

I think it’s weird vaccine done me, I’d rather deal covid, oh well, guess.

•	535 (18%) died 
 
**135,867,425** Americans fully vaccinated June 1, 2021. 
 
This means that:
