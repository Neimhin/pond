Secondly, masks masks, crowded vehicle likely becomes disease transmission. think correct attributing least problem running capacity. could otherwise ?

In quite cities elsewhere [few exposure incidents traced public think simply places developed countries saw sudden drop usage. say crowding still major problem live, drop passenger numbers obviously enough effect. Genuinely curious, scheduled annual shots go you? say request still needs route up, approval authority (at least Air Force) 4-star general. fully expect *he* deny majority similar grounds choice alone.

In honesty think there's good chance even approved requests still lead administrative discharge, one punitive elements. vaccinated Covid-19 essentially undeployable forever growing number countries even let *transit them* without fully vaccinated.  Everyone work vaccinated except her.
SJS Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Basically it‚Äôs disease causes severe allergic reaction often caused prescription medication antibiotic. it, medication cause flair up. literally proved point - amazing probably'd useless war tbfh  Must nice! funny since COVID cause reproductive issues men due attacks body.  Oh no‚Ä¶  8%, unfortunately triple that.

It's quite sad idiots probably end law enforcement. Well look data CDC 6% die covid rest die covid. show cdc website showing pregnant people dying droves? Honesty finding it, doubt, can't find fact. yep gave months ago. masks vaccinated announcement crappy vaccine cards huge mistakes. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) rare, serious disorder skin mucous membranes. usually reaction medication starts flu-like symptoms, followed painful rash spreads blisters. top layer affected skin dies, sheds begins heal several days.

This sounds Although SJS associated COVID-19 vaccination, rare, benefits receiving vaccination outweigh potential harms. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) acute hypersensitivity reaction causes extensive necrosis mucous membrane skin. mean say claim bs use stuff that‚Äôs tested HEK-293?   Unless link proof that, say 90% shit comes TWELVE people completely insane.

I think total vaccine hesitation 20% 25% worldwide. never vaccinate entire population, impossible. 

But suggest countries protesting vaccines right world wide comes 12 people? possible. two different comparisons summarized Fig.2: 1) 2019 2020, 2) 2015 2019. see men suffered bigger loss covid (look left gray line). also gained life expectancy previous 4 years (look right). Therefore, compare 2015 2020, totally surprising men little better women. I'm pro vaccine mandates gone two ways conservatives liberals. Obamacare prevents insurance companies charging higher premiums unvaccinated.

Honestly insurance companies probably would easiest way mandate vaccine. insurance company wants one taking unvaccinated much game chicken like airlines. logic goes like this:

1. HEK-293 derived (probably) elective abortion 1970s.

2. Elective abortions ""wicked"" (yes, read request used word) reasons.

3. Thousands cell generations half century later, early-stage efficacy test Pfizer vaccine done HEK-293 cells.

4. Pfizer vaccine ""wicked"" can't body.

5. Proceed ignore overwhelming majority modern medicine least knowledge derived research involving fetal cell lines.  Sticks work. Carrots don't. also reserve transplants people actually need them, dad.  even make sense. that‚Äôs like saying vegetables bad criminals eat vegetables something equally absurd damn got downvoted oblivion.

You guys personal responsibility right? one forcing transplant patients get vaccine. cry consequences getting jab go bottom waiting list. Wiping good germs. wash hands since much COVID?

I agree needing use airflow filters. everything. 40000 people US die flu every year, many deaths traffic firearms. gonna battle waning immunity vs boosters/vaccinations/natural immunity/immunization eligibility increases whatever R0 prominent variant is. 

A variant high enough R0 could begin spread waning immunity outpaces vaxes/boosters/natural infection growth. 

Delta R0 7.5, means population must 87% protected prevent spread via herd immunity. We're pretty close US average, states much less.

So basically, figure strain virus prominent, determine R0 figure % population protected. OG Covid R0 2.5, needed 60% population protected get herd immunity. much virulent strain, like R0 16, need 94% population protected. 

Personally, think Delta last ""huge"" wave. We'll regional/subregional spikes long keep vaccinating/boosting, think population protection % drop far enough prevent lot new spread, unless super fit strain comes around. Maybe pull bootstraps! don‚Äôt know nurse ‚Äú5 year degree‚Äù tell essentially same. aren‚Äôt anti-vax anti vax. real sense tho. I'm pretty sure mean *cytokine storm* involved COVID infection.  picked show generality would apply people reading it.    offer hypothesis sinovac plus AZ shows better efficacy symptoms hospitalization compared sinovac plus pfizer?

This definition, clearly see multiple people thread posting sentiment me.

This headline carefully crafted misleading, shared websites clicks. U.S., check web site local pharmacy chains. Many setting appointments boosters. That's set mine (set 6 days now). They'll ask questions see qualify important one vaccine originally had. believe currently people got Pfizer, others added later likely. course born christian.      Winter coming. used define click bait titles nothing article content, purposefully lied seriously misled reader come opposite true conclusion states article. people hyped board media hate train consider headlines accurate crafted interesting exciting possible, always headlines crafted, click bait. keep watering term means nothing become old man yelling clouds. Yeah still see people vaccinated haven‚Äôt worn mask months, minimally wear unless absolutely to. 

I think much larger proportion population gets talked about. Most/all attention seems people either hyper-anti everything, people hyper-cautious want keep masking/distancing stuff long-term two groups trend toward louder views draw clicks antics. 

But would guess (based anecdotal observation NY) pretty big chunk vaccinated Americans, they've quietly returned mostly normal life. Still masking places strictly require it, maybe little observant things like hand washing etc., otherwise largely pre-pandemic normal.   anything actually happen people though?

Genuine curiousity: get told get vaccine, say no...then what? let go move life? sounds like results employer, wondering military holds higher consequence.  Ok thank you. patiently keep waiting.  \*At least according data available us currently ""Vaccine hesitant"" implies there's element doubt that, cleared, would make switch either pro vaccines.

In opinion doubt clear enough? yet hear reason skepticism. That's accurate all. N95 masks effective way prevent spread besides quarantine, that's doctors covid wards still wear even vaccinated. field in? Sounds like workplace exception others here. I'm definitely curious now.  went CVS, show proof getting Pfizer first 2 shots.  would beg differ perspective military slow adopt medical procedures. Medicine military quick adopt new techniques procedures find works. fact, many techniques procedures passed learn wartime medicine civilian sector, especially regards trauma medicine. 

Tourniquets example phased use civilian sector back still lingering fear using tourniquet among medical professionals civilian side. military us know use tourniquet, saves lives. civilian sector started take tourniquet use again. 

OK COVID trauma. know. military also really great preventative medicine (much better civilian sector). Additionally, various diseases researched using military funds personnel past, malaria yellow fever example. ton vaccines get given others even looked civilian sector (yellow fever vaccine). 

I agree, however, COVID vaccine seen best option troops time reduces hospitalization rates infected. think main thought behind mandatory vaccination.

What mean is, look past data want, trending data much important referring future outcomes. vaccinated older/immunocompromised people first, virus moved younger populations (40-65), vaccinated age group started seeing uptick group that, persisted.

Most recently Delta variant, seen uptick reported cases U12 age groups (and consider cases always order magnitude higher official reports).

Well‚Ä¶ Asking myself. personally think better waiting JNJ booster , come guess. Nice company challenge anyone's unemployment benefits resigns due vaccine mandate. However unvaccinated person denied exemption resign goes disciplinary process, lose job, company challenge unemployment application. 

The way see it, shit situation everyone involved. people, rightfully wrongfully, distrust government mass media. much misinformation people going get caught it. sympathize. people lose jobs deserve get unemployment. One issues employer rejects religious exemption application, appeal. employer decide people's religious beliefs genuine? Personally, believe someone willing put career risk, pretty damn sincere. people continued work pandemic due misinformation, distrust, general confusion; go financial hardship. someone scared, distrustful, plain dumb, mean less deserving help time need. 

Employers want lose qualified team members. industry, takes several months get clearance another 8 months get qualified positions. fully vaccinated back April year, zero coercion. genuinely hope everyone work get Covid-19 vaccine. keep jobs, better protected Covid-19.

Anyway see immense challenges getting vaccine poor countries. let us carry medical records around first days knew received. rumor mine food, shots. think lump anti-vaxxers anti-lockdown protesters.

I think covid huge issue boat sailed kind containment long term think full lockdown mitigation strategy workable solution longer. understand anti-lockdown stance.

NYT today.:

The idea especially alluring anybody making effort careful feeling frustrated many Americans seem blas√©. all, Covid fable truth it. Social distancing masking reduce spread virus. powerful people often imagine.

The main determinants Covid‚Äôs spread (other vaccines, extremely effective) remain mysterious. activities seem dangerous, like in-person school crowded outdoor gatherings, may always be. unsatisfying is, know cases recently plunged. decline consistent fact Covid surges often last two months receding, that‚Äôs merely description data, causal explanation.

‚ÄúWe still really cave ages terms understanding viruses emerge, spread, start stop, do,‚Äù Michael Osterholm, epidemiologist University Minnesota, told me. probably right now, we‚Äôre Delta outbreak New Zealand. biggest city, Auckland, lockdown since mid-August. also fair share anti-lockdown protests anti-vaxxers would certainly delay vaccination targets.

It‚Äôs (usually). They‚Äôre terrified they‚Äôve fed steady diet sensationalized garbage years. They‚Äôre entire support system feed garbage echo chamber eventually grew separate reality. Ah mentioned 56% efficacy two doses sinovac. hoping number two doses Pfizer. Thanks anyway.  ""Hope COVID winter less severe 2021"" No, boosters given people received two Sinovac doses bad was.  Oh believe me, am, thing over. Spacing people limit total number people. limits number people expected covid. That's still absurd one wealthiest nations world. developed countries, life expectancy increased pandemic. ones getting shot probably lot ones want cops begin with. hope walk Political tolerance No, said direct comparison done different vaccines used different age risk groups, different contexts. 92% vaccinated, (less than) 1% suspended. 1% 2,200, missing 7% 10,000. Even 10% 7% somehow medical excuses, that's still 10,000 presumably used religious exemptions. paid Russian trolls spouting nonsense

I think enough idiots country. probably need blame countries that... Yes, also based people given second dose, also groups like healthcare workers, teachers, on, received vaccines early. used Astrazeneca elderly Pfizer 55. Sinovac used booster special cases doctors determined safer.  vaccine bit less effective infection Delta @ nearly 70% 7 months, that's pretty great news. Also, really intriguing broke subsets population (age, comorbidities, etc...). Finally, always, results weighted population increasingly building immunity via infection, weighted vaccines. likely scores effective vaccines infection. Sources claims? Vaccine still provides big statistical difference terms immunity. May big compared unexposed unvaccinated, medical workers three shot series. think fine one certified infection. still need 2 shots. exactly sort thing study regardless whether think likely threat. exactly sort thing people afraid necessarily bring know they'll met dismissive answers.

Instead calling people idiots dismissing, bet focusing fears, rather simply safety would really effective. Dumba$$ Yup seems reasonable. that‚Äôs takes. Wonder mentality going back terminated work. Hopefully go back it‚Äôs disgruntled employee. Colorado currently 10-20 under-18s hospitalized covid; unvaccinated. currently 0 hospitalizations due vaccination age groups.

Over course pandemic, 4 under-10 deaths Covid, 16 deaths age 10-19, 0 deaths age brackets vaccination. 

The fact risk getting vaccinated small change overall comparison. 20 dead children worse 0 dead children. also, course, ignores high value preventing transmission.

For exact numbers, under-18s 1/50,000 mortality original Covid (per study) several times higher Delta. Vaccination drops that, probably 95% every age bracket, everyone says 100% vaccinated under-18 yet severe covid. basically pandemic ending antivaxxers seeing sense.

I‚Äôm Covid nurse. vaxxed patient last week. first one, memorable. actually went home fairly quickly. hadn‚Äôt gotten booster vaxxed early on. (Plus, advanced years diabetes, hadn‚Äôt controlling. Plus, obese didn‚Äôt control BP. Etc.) fine went home. actually left room air, unusual patients. Even young guys normally go home oxygen bottle. 

All patients unvaccinated. 

I wish everyone could couple shifts Covid unit watch exactly people go through. short, it‚Äôs freaking terrible. It‚Äôs terrible enough watch it, let alone experience it. It‚Äôs fair. eats young too. eats athletes never hospitalized lives. feel them. fact they‚Äôre unvaccinated makes one bit easier watch suffer realizing lives entirely changed, perhaps forever. People regularly rip oxygen, they‚Äôre miserable want escape torture. makes nurse feel pretty darn guilty. 

We magic drugs. feel super helpless. don‚Äôt know answers questions, ‚Äòwill ever able work job before? oxygen forever? support kids now?‚Äô ‚Äòwhy me? brothers/cousins/friends/etc got virus didn‚Äôt get sick. me.‚Äô know. 

I feel like it‚Äôs largely useless explain people really don‚Äôt want go crap.

There‚Äôs huge range middle ground. us don‚Äôt wanna live bottle horrible impact blood clots anoxia (lost limbs, kidney damage, brain damage, heart damage, etc.) 
I wish everyone could see it, sucks people regretting decision get vaxxed. end, left holding bag. Really. Onslaught?   confirm. go get vaccinated shady ass 90-year-old doctor make green card application.

But course, asking Joe Schmoe get vaccinated order eat restaurants egregious overreaction. No, antivaxxers look headlines like support predispositions Same.

Current US trends definitely positive. Looks like peaked already hospitalizations rise anywhere near prior levels. Cases going well. UK interesting sense cases risen bit hovered around high 30K quite awhile. Good news is, hospitalizations deaths near January levels.

Conclusion? Vaccines fucking work.   Good thing is, risk myocarditis getting COVID-19 0.146%, 6 times higher 0.025% vaccine males 12-17.

Now, pre-Delta, might think ""yeah, 100% chance catching COVID-19 directly comparable."" point basically every unvaccinated person going get COVID-19, they're fairly comparable. say even considering risk myocarditis, ignoring problems COVID-19 cause, still better vaccine, actually lowers risk. Follow money, always going outcome government mandates not. Companies seeing $$$ multi-week hospital stays trying mitigate that. Turns there's really simple free way - make sure employees vaccinated.

Even among vaccinated parents hesitancy vaccinate children. personally trust fda properly evaluating benefits risk Pfizer vaccine 5-11yo. know Pfizer got fastest, really wish choices kid vaccines. countries preferred vaccines given risk profile, wish US similarly nuanced approach minimize adverse vaccine response. (Think moderna young males, AstraZeneca 40s females, one dose confirmed prior infection). get booster? Even got 100% human population vaccinated, already native animal populations. [White tailed deer example. Hoping eradication delusional best. believe issue supply NZ. However like said STILL deaths, even amongst vaccinated. fact, might even see higher death rate considering lot latent community exposure prevent surge. guess end result bit push, begs question, 18 months lockdowns worth it? someone would considered low risk category, say fuck no. first like ""how get boosters without first shot?"" like ""oh......"" give weekly game cards herd. unmasked indoor conversations squirrels. distanced Thanksgiving beaver den. 

It does, also doesn't. risk already there, maybe little risk now, pointed below, big deal.

There's new update today (Friday) - Danish health agency said 'badly worded' statement made seem like paused Moderna. They're still offering under-18s.

Yes, blame media. headline purposely orchestrated get clicks. Dad retired Lt Col. mom vaxxed. got shots transferred Europe moved there. big deal. build decent air filtration system way OP phrased it, sounds like Marine retired. evidence generally Delta variant cause worse sympoms affect vaccine protection, rather length time post vaccination. expect cause ongoing synonyms, risk reinfection/vaccine breakthrough would higher time goes (which may make look like effect Delta).

3. Provinces cities along route travel responsible coordinating traffic logistical support, necessary. destination province city responsible taking measures ensure pandemic prevention control adhered to.

4. Ministry Health (MoH) allocate vaccines, giving priority provinces people returning pandemic areas. MoH Ministry National Defense Support also hand support localities discover new COVID-19 cases result returnees south.¬†

*[note: figures published morning, ""Wednesday"" figures represent happened Tuesday, etc.]* guess it‚Äôs like early days supply issue. stupid, evil. kinds statements destroying CDC‚Äôs credibility issue. Masks work near good vaccines vaccines work like every vaccine 100% effective. statements cause fear never ending protective measures without concern costs measures government overreach like see idea COVID problems mice. Hopefully, I‚Äôm buying optimism ever happened summer  Well 66.2 million fully vaccinated 6 months ago, good percentage Moderna, overall probably fewer.

But rush right now. Boosters new, initial surge people who've waiting getting start, weeks drop off.  Seems like time spent generating revenue pay paychecks. That‚Äôs OK it‚Äôs great litmus test identifying fucking idiots. Oh dumbest 40% police force gone now. There's meat packing plant zip code. 100% source first outbreak area. even reported local paper. sad thing is, zip code also one lowest vaccination county. There's zero outreach pharmacies zip code either. Got Flu shot yesterday‚Ä¶ still debating whether get booster though month (Pfizer).   absolutely agree Solano County proved point. Bay Area counties could completely drop mask mandates today nothing would change kids masking schools high vax rates. 

I‚Äôd double check think Santa Cruz county ended indoor mask mandate today. dominoes starting fall get rid thank goodness. hospital I‚Äôm currently almost 2 weeks now. Seems going ok. Thanks response. ""surrendering"" suppose meant assume likely infected, vaccine would protect serious illness. opposed mindset vaccine make immune infection.

Tinnitus various causes important they'd check figure might causing -- anything earwax jaw muscle auditory system nerve, etc. meantime maybe try simple things like relaxation, gently massaging jaw muscle, etc?  Moderna seems better vaccine anyway; even half dose booster still 20ug Pfizer's. Although sucks cut dose half probably money since never tested anything else. bet 40% 40% cops beat spouse pretty significant overlap. Good riddance bad rubbish. ‚Äû wants to‚Äú.

Only decide what‚Äôs coming body. wait official booster shot JNJ (Janssen). 

I trust JNJ going forward follow recommendations. 

Really fan mixing.  honestly character fault assume grown ass people act like adults. years learned case.

we found yesterday family across street got covid. unvaccinated except girlfriend. mother hospital right now. multi-generational latino family. surprising vaccinated especially senior parents home.

they said coming it. us chatting across street one another, trash day. say 10 days remember party gathering weekend before. probably someone sick attended.

i upset irresponsible. said *thought flu*. 4 days. mom dad still down. know mom now. disease even recover take years life.

i want it. like may brain body current faults. adding please.

they realize keeping us hostage, people actual brains morals. peace. Although lot terrible cops country, major city losing 40 percent police force really wouldn‚Äôt good thing. Hopefully many get jab things could get really ugly.  Same. Shot 3 (general feeling malaise fatigue 36ish hours) worse shot 1 (no real side effects), bad shot 2 (malaise low grade fever chills 48ish hours). 

Had mild sore arm 3 -- never got deadarm lot reported. Yeah didn‚Äôt mean confuse all, that, got moderna, immune compromised get moderna booster even they‚Äôre fully approved hate headlines try make seem like quoting someone fact that's CDC director said, said per article ""We lot science right now. vaccines, can't really predict human behavior. Human behavior pandemic served us well."" mentioned before, hope quit. forced work there, door open leave time. want people act like end taking care family/friends need go hospital, either get vaxxed get way. I'd concerned actually enough make difference 2-5% (whatever) easily replaceable. lot people going cave anyway luxury finding work somewhere else easily. They're gonna end getting shot talk it. ü§∑  Soon we'll see media saying: ""covid cases tens thousands, lockdowns recommended"" They're 3rd shots Moderna them; boosters Moderna half dose. pretty inexplicable anything money grab finding vaccine working better Pfizer room reduce dose. test multiple booster doses choose 50 best; simply never tested amount. think mean behavior worst humanity. become pandemic idiocy. Commander n Chief: Imma need go X country, tear shit risk lives. 

Military: shall follow orders 

President: Oh need get vaccinated well

Military: WOAH CANT TELL BODY Cant wait.  Still super clear you‚Äôll accept valid study.

Study - Unvaccinated individuals became reinfected Vaccinated individuals (100%) previous infection became reinfected

OR 

Study B - Unvaccinated individuals became reinfected Vaccinated individuals may may (ie &lt; 100%) previous infection became infected

Which study applicable you? think want Study don‚Äôt know.

If want Study that‚Äôs exactly study contains keep rejecting **residents aged ‚â•18 years SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) antigen test results**i‚Ä† reported Kentucky‚Äôs National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) March‚ÄìDecember 2020 **were eligible inclusion.**‚Äù

Out curiosity, seem think it‚Äôs easy adjust results study account certain factors won‚Äôt accept one options think it‚Äôs impossible account outside factor? correct? so, think adjusting masks/social distancing possible adjustments aren‚Äôt?

I‚Äôm professional researcher, appear despite posturing, don‚Äôt know isn‚Äôt possible account know exactly you‚Äôre looking go finding research demonstrates (assuming dismiss study above).

I think one interesting difference perspectives US you‚Äôre maybe UK? US don‚Äôt central database infections like (at least I‚Äôm aware of) HIPAA prevents unauthorized disclosure medical information 3rd party.

This next quote talking travel imagine system describes similar enough you‚Äôre talking comparable:

‚ÄúIf traveling documentation recovery, must present paper electronic copies positive test result (dated 90 days ago) signed letter, official letterhead contains name, address, phone number licensed healthcare provider public health official, stating cleared end isolation therefore travel. letter states cleared end isolation return work school also acceptable. letter specifically mention travel.‚Äù

Proof positive test required ‚Äúofficial letter‚Äù doctor clearing end isolation. letter could easily forged and, due HIPAA, it‚Äôs completely unverifiable without patient consent (which obviously they‚Äôll decline provide forged document). runs close honor system mine many experts comfort.

Meanwhile data vaccination card verifiable without violating HIPAA presenting card also provides patient consent review information. vaccine information also stored national database cannot said ‚Äúproof recovery‚Äù documentation (in US) far I‚Äôm aware.

I don‚Äôt know things work UK ‚Äúproof recovery‚Äù opens wide gap relied lives risk.

That fullfact article linked says clearly top:

‚ÄúWHAT CLAIMED
Research Israel suggests Pfizer vaccine much less protective Covid-19 natural immunity catching disease.‚Äù

‚ÄúOUR VERDICT
The research say this. However, **it also says infected people even better protected get vaccinated well.**‚Äù

I still reject study seems like also presented misleading way suggest vaccination much less effective magnitude 13x less seems study may demonstrating benefits vaccination previously infected.

This exactly unqualified amateurs (aka I) business trying parse complicated medical studies ourselves. didn‚Äôt even come correct conclusion seems desperately want natural immunity better/equal.

Regardless, Kentucky study seems address issue well comes conclusion.

I‚Äôm sure find important ‚Äúexactly expect true‚Äù quote. could mean expert validating results could using demonstrate presence bias interpretation ‚Ä¶ something else? it‚Äôs important explain why.

You seem using quote support ‚Äú13x likely‚Äù claim study (or least study general) that‚Äôs really conclusion study according link unintentionally argue position?

Finally, address vaccination reliable consistent natural immunity. primary issue natural immunity it‚Äôs wildly variable.

You could natural immunity asymptomatic infection fades little 30-60 days could stronger natural immunity lasts much longer severe infection almost kills you. two extremes ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù FAR equivalent don‚Äôt think reasonably rely ‚Äúproof recovery‚Äù valid benchmark someone‚Äôs infectability result.

To get ‚Äúbest‚Äù immunity natural infection, something equivalent standard vaccination dose, almost DIE almost assuredly permanent damage body.

Meanwhile vaccine consistent dose results relatively uniform immunity everyone gets big part vaccinated reduces chances dying COVID &lt;1% natural immunity it‚Äôs 3%. 1 2% might seem small death penalty want push % close 0 possible vaccine better consistently natural immunity alone.

I‚Äôll never drop this. vested interest combatting misinformation vaccine hesitancy it‚Äôs important me. I‚Äôve debating keep getting fuel next debate appreciate conversation I‚Äôm learning counter pseudo-intellectuals anti-vax crowd often difficult try blind jargon ‚Äúfacts‚Äù difficult refute without expert they‚Äôll never admit aren‚Äôt. know, seems like common sense me.

If crafted headline probably never would considered someone would think implying people getting boosters first shots that's literally impossible.

Maybe vaccine different doses person could get ""Booster"" (the 5 mg shot example) get ""First shot"" (the 10mg shot, example), that's vaccine.

And someone would brought attention would like, ""Welp, guess people gonna confused think second."" far know, Pfizer Moderna consiered booster shots. Plus, yesterday, RKI longer considers people one dose J&amp;J sufficiently protected (too many break-through infections), much wants take mRNA booster. mean, pretty much lot parts US European countries, good places! someone covid, decided get booster after, count. Could imply already infected getting boosters? know. overtime probably make more. Well, duuuuuh.  2 million people half percent population, that's going major impact. 1.1m definitely counted first shots, think people claiming immunocompromised that.  cops stupid? ‚Ä¶They weren‚Äôt idiots vaccine access yet Rip...and liver disease first 1.1m would counted first shots boosters available immunocompromised I'd imagine people would want say that, often check state db 1st shot verify whether immunocompromised, get card. cops make good money pensions. think LA cops make?  Great news. let's get local police vaccinated train wear masks, too. blind? Read comments thread.  hell. different idiots.   mentioned exact thing idiot posted crazy biden would force upon soldiers(hint, biden military leaders DOJ)

He replied ""please move China cuba"" somehow getting vaccines military new akin communism.

He even serve military. He's beach loving shitty sport fisherman. special kind idiots.   browse everything one set accounts. youtube recommendations straight ouy Jekyll Hyde first I‚Äôve seen comment it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve saying weeks. totally support boosters circumvented beaurocracy get one, anyone got one saying first shot mucking US trends numbers. Maybe it‚Äôs small number statistical impact.  

I‚Äôd hate epidemiologist studying COVID numbers future. Case counts, deaths vaccine rates completely inaccurate point.   headline ""even hesitant getting vaccinated."" No, they're not. hesitant precisely ones stubbornly giving jobs.  one seeing reports mass layoffs/suspensions due vaxx status thinking rest employees probably pissed they‚Äôre pick slack people‚Äôs work? Thissss. I've pregnant twice covid... terrifying ways many people seem understand Oh cool kid now? Awesome! felt like back school ahaha Fair point.  makes language needlessly complex reason. example, American Cancer society recommends prostate exams men 50. offensive right trans people consider men prostates? exclude somehow language. say ""People prostates 50 get exams?"" complex reason. let's say talking screenings uterine cancer. say then? People uteruses? offensive call pregnant person mother give birth? somehow ok one cares. rules avoid offending people needlessly complex reason. fuck governments send pulse oximeters address test positive community test centres. 50% reduction deaths huge benefit dwarf administrative cost sending out.

Could even collect re-use next positive case cost equipment issue   Really? get f' u, think myself. get f'u, going get immunocompromised vaccines suckers.

&amp;#x200B;

I saying first right attitude, least makes logical sense. second lunacy. Maybe booster vaccine time portal along microchip. I'm still opening neighbor's garage Pfizer chippy. wish push everyone get booster shot time comes. 

I think Biden made mistake initially giving incentives vaccines first became available March. would've promoted major incentive, like $700 every American shot (even first booster shot), would've big news time. Even hesitant would've gone it. we'd looking forward another check Christmas. We'd 70% fully vaccinated now. don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs really hard become anesthesiologist‚Ä¶ think two major questions whether variant significantly evades vaccine and/or natural immunity, whether significant waning immunity include severe illness anytime soon. answers great shape, especially work mandates begin.  Makes sense. receive organ transplant you‚Äôre immune suppressing meds life. Johns Hopkins study organ transplant recipients vaccinated COVID many developed zero antibodies. Zilch. need get vaccinated organ transplant happens possible shot developing antibodies. Ditto. We'll dealing long time I'm hoping last big surge we'll see. we've wrong before. Tell women peanut 70 person baby showers vaccines. I‚Äôve never met dumb ppl think know doctors   Honestly think that's best possible solution: let feel pain month paycheck unemployment benefits, offer job back they'd like get vaccinated. Lots primary care docs writing prescriptions they‚Äôre tired arguing want patient go away. least way know it‚Äôs human dose won‚Äôt kill them. Definitely would want anesthesiologist Lol. Says guy doesn‚Äôt understand transplants work. trying figure out

Leave doctors scientists.  think cut cost shipping delivery help fast vaccine given people.

Additionally, plant would good future viruses combat diseases Moderna make vaccines with.  It‚Äôs go immunosuppressants get transplant, don‚Äôt want give someone kidney die Covid 2 months later. Seems fair.  don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs accurate: Tamiflu problem‚Ä¶  Bio tech makes sense IMO. Biology technology. Move Montana. outlawed mandatory vaccination employment discrimination unvaccinated. It‚Äôs funny vaccines mandates decades, public schools, transplants (and medical procedures), military, hospital/medical workers‚Ä¶

And one cares except fringe anti-vaxxers, it‚Äôs politicized suddenly people actually don‚Äôt care refuse life saving vaccine. Yes inevitably certain number infected Australia infections occur 70%+ population vaccinated almost every country bulk infections occured much lower vaccination rate.

Because expect total excess deaths Australia lower countries solution simple. go LA. Got vaccinated 18w 21w pregnant. Found pregnancy thyroid issue. anything thyroid issue time. Thyroid issue likely reason baby SGA (Small gestational age) potentially genetics. met SGA criteria ~grams~. Every healthcare worker said ""oh, shes small, worries"".

Those people unvaccinated care going fuck rest population over.   40 000 (i read 100 000 seems really hight) medical procedures pushed back previous waves running ICU beds meaning ICU beds associated recovery riskier procedures put hold..

The USA hospitals beds filling even couple weeks ago.

We also require full vaccination enter restaurant (or even sit outside) , sporting event (even youth sports) public venues outside malls stores limits capacity.  Mask mandates still enforce vaccinated living pretty close normal lives.  School also require mask..  Two provinces Alberta, pretended pandemic remove mandates June completely fucked right icu capacity..  75% 12+ vaxxed. Imagine shock glands bad vaccinable diseases like mumps. one side effects covid swollen/painful testicles, ovaries (just breast, help) people would run get vaccine. know least services looking manning cuts next years due budget constraints.

For worth, FDA moving light speed here. Pfizer submitted final data child trials one week ago, FDA hold advisory hearing *three weeks* application formally submitted. That's crazy fast. Three months would fast normal circumstances.

The FDA piling people resources onto application move forward fast Furthermore, ship instant get FDA approval, like initial roll out.

This giving much confidence...

The initial roll-out bit cluster start hope tehy've learned lessons time around really get door instantly. it‚Äôs literally not. It‚Äôs something sounds weird you.

It‚Äôs profit warehousing model action. Meanwhile pay they‚Äôre offering criminally low. industries getting message finally raising wages, nursing homes consistently $2-$3/hour less standard rates. doesn‚Äôt exactly keep competitive hiring environment, especially nature work amount effort goes providing elder care. I'm certain sources allowed here, quite articles reputable news organizations discussing this. case counts kids climbing since May, hospitalizations higher past months.

Report: 20% U.S. Weekly COVID-19 Cases Another dream dashed *shakes fist sky*  Correlative study‚Ä¶yet interesting   depends primary goal keep people hospital prevent infections. health agencies far seem satisfied original shots preventing former. There's also argument places low first vaccination rates prioritized prevent deaths. unvaccinated adults keep COVID spreading community, putting others risk. can‚Äôt anything unvaccinated adults, minimize risk daughter getting vaccinated. ‚Äúdevelop it‚Äù entail? would fired cause anyway, typically denies unemployment. 0.5% 4.1 million vaccinated indivduals got infected 
does mean breakthrough rate vaccinated indiviauls 0.5% (which would mean vaccine efficacy 99.5%). would true if 
all 4.1 million individuals exposed virus. 

(To clarify, vaccine efficacy= 1 - breakthrough rate %, calculating one also get other.)

As UK governments report vaccine efficacy states ""Vaccine effectiveness estimated comparing rates disease vaccinated 
individuals rates unvaccinated individuals"" - aka using control group. even vaccine manafactureres claimed vaccine efficacy 99.5%. UK government report ""Estimates 2 doses currently only 
available Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine indicate effectiveness infection of 
70 90% "" sympotmatic disease ""Data 2 doses currently available Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine indicates effectiveness around 85 90%""

Regardless, 0.5% figure incomparable 0.7% figure many reasons keys one are: 
\-The 0.7% figure people severe infection, whereas 0.5% whole population. know people ended with 
severe infection covid higher prevelance comorbidites increase chance reinfection compared average population 
\-They different cities different time periods, exposure virus going signficantly different multiple reasons including different case rates, population density, mask use etc

These figures therefore evidence vaccination alone provides better protection previous infection alone, try present disingenuous. 


Previously infected indivuals asymtomatic recorded ""vaccinated only"" would skew results favour vaccination offering protection, I'm sure would ways account small statiscal impact may results regardless. 420+ comments original comparative study Israel, seen one person flag concern.

""It‚Äôs confusing thought talking benefits vaccination previous immunity want know breakthrough rate someone vaccinated maybe never COVID. don‚Äôt see relevance information context""

There policies (such one article post discussion orignally about) made assume individuals previously infected greater risk catching, spreading dying covid vaccinated infected. Vaccine passports example (that exempt prior infection, many do), allow entry nighthtclub someone vaccinated, allow entry someone previously infected. based logic, needs evidence vaccinated indivudal lower chance carrying covid, previously infected indivudal. information important. 
I find incredibly hard believe comaprative studies would provide evidence already completed, convinced  
that late so. So, vaccinated girlfriend tested positive today. got vaccinated back February. got second shot 19th last month. I‚Äôm starting feel body aches pain, scheduled get tested tomorrow. it, expect?   Dire outcomes mean 9 cognitive tests 2 came significant difference multiple testing correction. low correlations weird age effects (the curves look like covid patients worse tests, certain age. brain stuff also seems show age effect (with cutoff around 62 covid patients start diverging).

Interesting stuff looking forward see comes actual publication, preprint even mention 7 cognitive tests happens there, showing things significant really appropriate more..

Regardless, results would justify multi-year lockdowns waiting results effective vaccines. Moderna 250 phase 1

Background: novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic generated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). primary infection site mucosal surfaces, mainly lungs intestine, epithelial cells infected. COVID-19 spread throughout world, causing millions deaths hundreds millions confirmed infections. Despite global spread SARS-CoV-2, extreme differences countries mortality rates confirmed infections.

Methods: Pearson correlations t-test performed data 137 countries order test correlation number deaths diarrheal diseases (pre-COVID-19 pandemic data) marker countries‚Äô sanitation level, number confirmed COVID-19 cases deaths per million.

Results: found countries‚Äô prevalence confirmed COVID-19 cases deaths per million statistically correlated sanitation level.

Conclusions: hypothesis proposed article low mortality rates COVID-19 countries level sanitation low due fecal-oral infection population SARS-CoV-2, rather infection respiratory system. hypothesis supported protective effect low sanitation level presented work fact lung infection SARS-CoV-2 cause severe pathology, infection intestine generally causes minor symptoms.  surprising. I've rocking 6 portable medical grade HEPA purifiers year now. 

The utter disgrace entire pandemic little emphasis placed communicating public disease ridiculously airborne stupid-contagious result. Air also liquid. perfect medium within suspend highly concentrated, densely contaminated cloud exhaled COVID-19 virions. knew anyone locked us. read weeks lockdowns.

Then Alpha happened. Delta happened.

Not vaccinated wearing mask? using HEPA filters spreading people out? exchanging contaminated air fresh air? Well doing?

I read 20-25% figure before, what's source that?
That alarming. Must remember too, figure true, speaks volumes vaccination. thing changing, though, dose right?

Nope, dose injection would extremely small (hard reliably administer), changed injection concentration. Per post NDC codes, different concentrations billing rules.

That said, Pfizer likely ALREADY manufacturing doses children, delay. Furthermore, ship instant get FDA approval, like initial roll out. such, likely little delay due manufacturing. Sure could, make conditional basic income. stacks.  fairly unlikely still testing positive 4 weeks past recovery. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs impossible special cases happens, vast majority people issue.

So we'll still able use vials, instead someone drawing X ml syringe draw syringe.

Basically I'm making sure going wait shipments new shit. would vaccinated people larger drop life expectancy? anything, it‚Äôs deaths also long term complications contribute this. impact workforce staggering. got vaccine early 2021 get $500 too. share proof full vaccination Hang there. 4 month old older kids household constant worry.

Kids lower risk hospitalization death past, approx 20-25% hospitalized cases moment, longer insignificant. I'm sure numbers hospital/death risk vaccinated adults vs risk unvaccinated kids.

Yes, human behavior decide pandemic ends, people come together take strict mediations lower cases, people reach point fatigue acceptance say they're done. 

For vaccinated, highly vaccinated areas, pandemic really touching much anymore. Life largely back normal, families largely safe they're ready move on. 

For unvaccinated, they're stubborn ideology really matter else happens. Cases deaths touching lives really moving needle them, going take new mitigations point. They're pretty done. 

The societal end pandemic come long epidemiological end, might say already here. Frankly, CDC partially blame manipulating, editorializing, bungling messaging throughout pandemic. Even people actually believe science, CDC working good faith shaking heads messaging that's coming agency. big miss entire pandemic. 

Whatever cause, pandemic people stop caring. anticipate last holdouts happen 2 weeks children get second doses. used give malaria pills soldiers outside USA cause FDA approved. turned side effects psychosis violence green beret killed family period Alpha variant prevalent Delta variant was, **efficacy infection fell 84.8% 67.1%**, p**rotection hospitalisation declined much less, 91.7% 88.7%**.

Everyone agrees degree personal freedom limited public safety, debate draw line. HCA unvaccinated people dying, unvaccinated people willfully aggressively spreading misinformation dying.

The hamburger analogy would like: subreddit dedicated pictures people spreading propaganda obesity actually healthy foot amputated diabetic complications. sure paper, covers issues describe using similar techniques. might unique strategy researchers:

""The anti-vaccination infodemic social media: behavioral analysis"" Germani Biller-Andorno: signed kill people guns, tanks, bombs etc

""Alright, take vaccine prevent dying highly contagious disease military fighting forces get weakened continue fully effective protecting country!""

""Waaaaaa way never!"" Yup.

Glanced workplace's blog, saw 'now pandemic over' first paragraph blinked. sure news lot people. I'd say put studies scrutiny 90% would issues. ok? would describe people deny science endanger others? wrong? 56% country vaccinated. reason think aren‚Äôt enough susceptible people another winter wave year. It‚Äôs honestly crazy see many people certain delta wave last bad waves. Basically means families certain African countries stop banging many children kids likely die diseases(they many children possible sure children survive adulthood etc) vaccine mandate issue really brought lot hypocracy sides. per usual, people caught believing right actually consider sides argument realize truth somewhere middle people caring infection (breakthrough infections, increased spread, long COVID). others think completely irrelevant.

Which wrong question anyway. FDA CDC WHO. care treatment regime safe cost effective. Safe obvious yes. Cost effective also yes. data clear ""memory immunity"" alone enough quell covid especially Delta, least we're pandemic territory.

Also personal opinion, people saying hospitalizations matter dead wrong. wish study handy, US vaccinated individuals higher risk dying covid peak delta wave unvaccinated June. concern getting Shingrex time, bad reputation pretty hard side effects (nothing like Shingles, course - that's HORRIBLE), want make worse. data really excellent point Propaganda works.

Some people hate America figured easy, legal way kill thousands Americans never get caught push propaganda keep people getting vaccinated middle goddamned plague. safe. much less likely catch virus. 6 months, MAY need booster. **All vaccinated people much less likely catch virus**, although primary protection severe illness. 

You vaccinating kids stop tiny chance getting sick, reasonable chance getting somewhat ill (like bad cold), undefined chance transmitting virus catch asymptomatically. 

In fully vaccinated environment, really reason masks quarantines. 

Delta infectious. That's breakthrough infections. worried cold? change life chance catching sinus infection? Bronchitis? No, don't. that's COVID is, **when vaccinated** vast majority neighbors family vaccinated. annoyance, life changing event. 

That surrendering - strange idea. ensuring disease kill you, cause long damage, brain damage. ensuring need vent need supplemental oxygen. keeps hospital. except risk upper respiratory infections living. vaccinate family, turning COVID another URI. second shot. Really hoping worse third lol. also ironic people claim right bodies context abortion dont believe apply medical procedures. 

I think everyone get vaccinated, people absolutely losing right choice setting precedent government mandate medical procedures. misspelled ""People started crybabys started taking excuse follow advice medical experts. Even warned follow instructions would make situation worse. created variants made necessary follow simple precautions again

You‚Äôre referring creation Delta?

Especially non-white people?

This case less cops better everyone concerns. Guess figured pension medical benefits worth freedoms Well, suspect Dr. Taylor TX may bias considering...Texas. Things much better parts country. 

She's comparing current situation completely unvaccinated country. pretty rough comparison

Its also wise point - ""letting guard down"" even mean? actual restrictions place drop, especially areas low transmission. Yes. catch, though, never know covid, kinda difficult. However, hear stories African Americans disproportionately affected covid, figured that's best odds are. Unless Hobby Lobby. They're equal others.  illustrates risk regulatory capture (i.e., companies tell regulators do, way around) sorts things way significant generally understood. surface, think effects would isolated meat packing industry, shows impacts public health.

That‚Äôs real shame. giving kids family needed :( No. 'population' article means total population (including children approved yet). likely almost 80% total population vaccinated soon.

are pretending bad thing? different dilution, vaccine, total volume, lower dose. small doses, using original dilution would make measuring accurately difficult. that's entire context dangers position.  risk mitigation different levels effectiveness. training, systems, processes.  Logging dangerous also shitty risk mitigation strategies right strategies cost much. end result higher injuries fatalities. police officer faces dangerous situations given day risk mitigations highly effective. end result fewer injuries fatalities. Last time checked logger worry tree laying ambush steal chainsaw cut half. realize many ""private"" businesses significant contact public? Except stupid question busy hunting ""victims"" notice deadline. Yeah would better had...

If look I'm actually saying versus strawmen people throwing out. 1.get people vaccinated 2.when high outbreak area large small isolate shutdown. truly limit travel virus going jump new area starve is. Stick fire analogy get rid possible fuel going die out.

If isolating advocating spread virus seem understand that. whole world actually bit bullet last year quarantined long necessary still dealing nonsense numbers economic recovery would farther along. Would need new vials use vials, different dosage? (Honest question)  breeding. People hydrate enough after. arm hurt day Moderna &amp; flu shot. that's it. see all. good put things context. Last year point seeing around 40,000 cases / 700 deaths day. we're 100,000 cases / 1500 deaths day. possibility another surge far-fetched especially people letting guard holidays. But, but, one different! modern science made quickly!! something. optimistic about? isn‚Äôt 1918 flu. vast majority people still unvaccinated. don‚Äôt see situation improves anytime next years. mean article literally talks recruitment issues correlates negative opinion law enforcement work.

In general many people qualify police officer. I'm sure stuck 15/hr thing cops already paying higher wages years like service industry folks flooding in?

There multiple barriers entry cop. First foremost *willingness* already filters significant population people. good time good people apply become cops. Gonna dental floss tycoon... CDC, FDA! delayed pushed back schedule, right on!

SO Thursday 4th November likely first day kids 5-11 would get Pfizer shots *if* new vials kids produced distributed then.

If can, wait day two, likely little crazy first. know someone together. NEVER get vaccinated little nuts happy couple days after. understanding viruses work tested for.

there something called ""window period"" point exposure/infection point immune system starts attempting fight off, creates antibodies, antibodies test for. HIV window period 3 6 months.

This many questions, specific questions asked donate blood- example used needles, gotten tattoo piercing, prison, last year...a bunch stuff like that.

&amp;#x200B;

these answers dictate weather even get donate blood day, done anything last 6 months might put ""window period"", wont take blood all.

&amp;#x200B;

but assure absolutely test everything, every single time.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: worked blood bank, also worked HIV clinic

&amp;#x200B;

in fact, find something blood, mail letter telling found something, wont tell need call doctor, people used donate blood instead going doctor. Muh Freedoms make opportune time defund, reorganize, hire mental health crisis workers. Covid caused 6 18 line duty deaths CA 2021. far.

Last year killed 12 throwing strawman. Quarantining area high infectious rate basic precaution used centuries. rest nonsense trying make say part argument. That‚Äôs 40% shouldn‚Äôt job first place. absolutely agree! nice deal September sniffles, lol. youngest second grade, finally growing worst it, think. cats dogs too, help allergies, firm believers 5-second rule food (within reason, much outside public places sure). consider us extremely fortunate anything chronic worse seasonal pollen allergies. saw friend yesterday chatting got text subordinate terminated. Yesterday final day employees prove vaccinated gave guy end day book appointment. Kid away great opportunity growth field reason. We're Alberta he's engineer. doubt anything else field mandate. like every company goes end 5% quit. 

Good riddance   Guess we'll see happens... Winter surge may start soon. Maybe it'll really bad, worse last year one taking precautions anymore. Maybe wont' bad huge % population already covid and/or vaccinated. 

It's anyone's guess point. 

My guess? bad last winter. still surge. Yeah, I'm south area hit crazy hard (top nation couple weeks), I've telling northern friends lookout, probably coming way soon people indoors. 

In south, we're indoors ton July August oppressive heat/humidity summer rain. schools going back early August refusal school districts require masking, makes total sense went happened.

The things think may save parts north repeat us 1) wearing masks indoors regularly 2) higher vaccination rate. areas things, long, ugly fall winter ahead them. COVID, cops died traffic accidents. could drive better. patient ask question yesterday provider said wait week vaccine get flu shot seem ignoring fact throwing straw man arguments. say shut entire global economy. seem false assumption. would bothered read points I've made isolating hotspots necessary, might realize tilting windmills. appreciate attempts sound smart using big words Straumann logic used people understand they're talking debate. Enjoy day world. Canada gonna build wall, rate US gonna last holdout covid CDC, FDA! delayed pushed back schedule, right on! Uh oh, minorities going beat up! would comply would go lot easier.

Ironic, it?  article talk 15/hr people qualify cop. least find it. 

the article talks police departments hard time recruitiing people.  Florida Man‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Easy way defund scum force? even click know one would be, lol. specific field study hold doctorate again? Thanks Fox News others downplaying covid. people wearing cloth masks, poorly fitting surgical masks, wearing mask nose, that's true. well-fitting n95s significantly reduce spread, probably comparable Janssen vaccine. Janssen 2-dose series Pfizer vaccines alone good enough prevent Delta spreading exponentially, measures important (not things must necessarily mandated). sure 2-dose Moderna good enough not; probably least first 3 months based data Pfizer's reduction transmission waning that. saw video chiropractors really makes sense... seen guy rig rip people's head off? Except clearly statistics back statement up. 

It's even job put lives line Joe Sally walking street fear cops cops fear Joe Sally.

There around 700000 police USA last year 264 died, due covid(145). Let's pretend .017% death rate cops means there's big conspiracy everyone trying kill cops even remotely true.  People whine getting vaccinated getting lives.

However, I'd recommend new associates. Cheers, talking military like talking doctors, many abbreviations.  i've asian. yes hard. wall wall people. sorry offended you. Get tonight. already got 2 Pfizer shots happens dont get 3rd booster shot? booster shot feel like immune system weakened older people need get booster shot anyways vaccine loses efficiency 6 months? 4th booster shot? ""CDC's independent Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP) plans meet Wednesday Thursday October 20-21 discuss COVID-19 vaccine boosters Moderna Johnson &amp; Johnson,"" CDC spokeswoman told CNN email.

Upvoted I'll correct comment. article nuggets merit. truly understand implications mitigate spread. comes goes real understanding why. mean stop things bring good question answer. call BS this, unless provide reputable source. Heart disease cancer higher there. Ah yes, identified two options:

Keep exactly is, remove police entirely start scratch.

Let's try working accountability equation first, maybe?  nurse treated mother wore power balance wristband. may pill monkey, medical facilities minimum standards. work immunologist provided graph covid pandemic overlaid graph 1918 pandemic. scientists interact daily basis seem pretty optimistic.

The fools non-professionals making predictions completely depth, optimistic pessimistic.  article says isolated incident. happened over. happen?

By high-ranking government officials believe COVID. 1. Everyone access multiple publishing platforms. need qualified, talented, smart, accomplished soap box reaches millions. Dumb ideas volume smart ones.
2. Thanks improved healthcare (including vaccines) society done \*great\* job keeping people alive, even past would dumb themselves.
3. Public education totally failed us US large percentage population suspicious anything requires 8th grade level comprehension.
4. revolving door government (policy) research (science), inept communications departments sides, compounded feral news media, tainted (or perhaps totally corrupted) good work done researchers science-based organizations. I‚Äôm Copenhagen Denmark government declared covid risk society anymore. Everything basically back normal. restrictions, mask requirements. It‚Äôs bit surreal think many parts world still ravaged pandemic. suspect ignore law, like laws. people need understand opinion fact. opinion vaccines obviate biology behind them. Maybe, yearly every 5 year booster stop coronavirus would worth it. Get flu shot 

The great thing mRna vaccines easy modify. They'll find new likely target trials that. speed made might able stay close enough behind changes. husband got early 2000's commissioned back 03 so, might FDA approval. We're old.  NFL, NBA, sports leagues definitely don‚Äôt stay isolated ten days testing positive asymptomatic infection. believe policy leagues asymptomatic breakthrough infection may get tested days, test negative, still play. 10 days isolation asymptomatic breakthrough infection seems absurdly necessary. Wait much make??? Always say destroyer humanity rock sixty miles wide, God's wrath, aliens, undead Sun exploding, would instrumental demise, sole cause it. Thanks Id bet money Venn diagram problem officers refusing vaxxed near perfect circle  get rid bad apples, whole bunch spoiled. spreads increasingly fast rate unless wholly excised.

It bugs proverb twisted mean exact opposite. People make bad life decisions good business decisions rare. probably want start looking better place work. nurses giving shots could follow recommendations. medication significantly different effects IV vs IM supposed aspirated injection, includes vaccines.

The fact nobody make right. as, advent automated blood pressure cuffs, *never once* saw blood pressure taken properly, even automated, still mostly done wrong. Sad horrible say maybe let idiots know studies love done India Middle East may drop clamoring Ivermectin like hot rock. ‚ÄúThe suspense terrible, hope last‚Äù Chiropractors virology astrologers science.  Definitely better vaccine still gives protection, meant two doses. know quite people felt completely fine second dose Pfizer. got Moderna husband got Pfizer said fine sore arm day. 

Another thing keep mind going somewhere vaccine required, get shots. want teachers believe science.

Don't want nurses believe medicine.

Don't want cops believe following rules due process.

Good riddance them.  move acute pandemic phase myocarditis side effects vaccines general going become growing problem. less thousands people dying every day getting single extra vaccine dose someone saving measurable fraction life.

Dose size also appears play large role myocarditis chance, certainly scales acute side effects. end moving regular boosters we'll almost certainly want dramatically drop dose. initial pfizer dose 30 mcg, 100 Moderna. We've seen beginnings Moderna dropping 50 third dose, pfizer dropping 10 under-11s. likely want carry even further, different dose sizes under-30s versus 30-65 versus 65+. Ha, quite. 40,000 cases day 1,000 deaths week UK. fact correct. Thanks. mean say fluid. always think phrase ""air fluid"" machine maintenance guy years every fluid power training class/publication drilled head. 

I'm like Ricky trailer park boys sometimes. Cheers. still can't get fact people get news social media platforms I'm supposed ok that. words generation: screwed! said, almost studies already scrutiny. ones generally come easily debunked results like ""the Earth flat"" ""a deworming drugs cures covid-19."" also tend appear fringe science sources, fringe Facebook accounts. cares. Well 80% adults already vaccinated expect boosters generally outstrip first-dosers 4:1. young healthy adults eligible Pfizer boosters? everyone celebrating cops leaving force. fine, guys think going replace people? wants cop right now? nobody. except people even unable job idiots. assholes loose jobs sure, it‚Äôs going bring wave awesome new cops going way better. tell, people want cops right want jump power abuse band wagon. think things going get worse get better Magic 8 Ball says: doubtful.

It complete tally - 17,985 departments US - short tune 100,000 officers. Depending omitted departments located, data could point thread point officer jobs dangerous

I never claimed dangerous job. are, however, 24 jobs likely result worker dying job; directly contradicts justification of, ""Every day wonder last day"".

Statistically speaking, many jobs would much significant concern. numbers simply lie. sensitive topic military choosing separate either ""general discharge"" ""other honorable"", pending couple laws. Discharge ranges honorable, medical, general, other-than-honorable dishonorable. O-T-H dishonorable discharge life long consequences future employment, dishonorable discharged people actually can't even guns. could say military lenient topic. Got Pfizer booster yesterday - little achy cold headache. Second dose hit lot harder even passed within 12 hours.  headline poorly constructed.
I read people getting booster shot without getting initial shot...
They changed subject without clarifying subject changed.
The headline reads would absolutely get red marks shown teacher.
A better way say would ""More people getting booster shot getting first shot."". California knows party...look up. Peace. Aight, bye   Back April 2020 friend mine commented western policy makers, doctors, public health professionals completely ignoring good faith warnings counterparts China.   want apologize inadvertently trivialized toll communicable diseases like flu.

The frightening, harrowing experiences life fighting bad flu viruses. Explosive fever, rapid pulse, dehydration room spinning several directions once, even eyes closed. Clutching sweat-soaked bedsheets migraine tunnels sharply brain roll meekly spew bile trash can. expect covid worse that, find many reasons mechanically remove virus air.

And point, yes absolutely everything. keep gallon medical grade isopropyl alcohol mechanic's towels, spray bottles full 90%. share tools day work, stay clean.

Cold/flu different beasts propagate close range droplet/surface transmission. course relevant really kick ass COVID-19 already.  unsubtly political, saw news article overlap map counties covid cases/unvax'd rate voter turn certain party nearly identical. Seeya! Luddite fuckers. come back.  Id curious see countdown timer showing rate COVID vaccinations would need occur reach 100%

Eg need vaccinate 8 people day, one hour meet deadline.

At point would need hit rate isn‚Äôt realistic, wonder happens? doubt would possible vaccinate remaining 40% one day, example. Protect serve? seem like pleasant person  sure tracking total number officers. FBI data surveyed number officers. claim many officers US. 

My point thread point officer jobs dangerous steps prevent death professions. Looking deaths alone would lead believe Marine Iraq 2003 2016 safer profession above.  Ah okay, actually help. Thank you! said see we're talking misinformation üòÖ  trust chiropractic doctor work back rib pops place.

If want good answer brain I'm going chiropractic doctor going brain specialist.

If ankle problem I'm going foot ankle doctor brain surgeon.

If want good answer infectious disease... get info from? forget people work prisons (guards, cooks, etc) necessarily quarantined. get work, go families, stores, churches, etc.

Also, many prisons pandemic, social distancing inside impossible. meant one infected person (either worker inmate) went prison, odds pretty good infections would start spreading rapidly. people seem catch to. getting boosters, gonna keep wearing masks, cases stay low want. Cases go up, maybe take care do. Fear paralyzing, upsetting, enough stupid.  never understood pushback vaccines. health screenings shots elementary, HS, college, work, travel, etc. Even now, work taking HS campus pay TB screening - standard practice. People need get head ass. Job openings LA cops. Easy requirement: vaccinated.  much ask some.  could opportunity!  Heck lot homeless people vaccinated, bring in. Give em job. fucking vote. Like every election. Priori Argument

A Priori Argument one comes 'knowledge' already know. 


""I think vaccines harmful, therefore alright try get people use helping them."" 
Is example starting 'information' already making reasoning it. reasoning sound, something harmful probably tell people use it. However unfortunately 'knowledge' started sound, therefore everything built upon knowledge sound. 
Like house built foundation sillystring.  


Does help? Straight horse's that's reputable enough you, news, shortage news articles read. Looking like 1000 days rate Civil forfeiture always going far especially officially designated department officers! timeline, fact. rate may even turn threat implementing rule lie threat try coerce businesses implementing without enforcement. Businesses federal contracts (like airlines) clear legal path implementing rules. potential OHSA rule announced day, movement OHSA's part. Seems like lower police budget weed general public rather have, call win, bluff move along. soon many lines crossed count.

...Still true, though.  live SW Florida driving one end area North Naples Sarasota little beyond point I've passed many traffic stops, seen people getting stopped pulled encounters minor traffic issues seen Wildlife cops state parks pulling people see permits passes, never seen **one** police officer wear mask since COVID-19 pandemic began.    put studies kind scrutiny. That‚Äôs you‚Äôre trained school continue practice. reason presentations called journal clubs analyze studies assess flaws, strengths, weaknesses etc, discuss peers formulate decisions whether incorporate information medical decision making. 

It‚Äôs non medical professionals zero idea takes practice medicine, make asinine comments assumptions zero training knowledgeable subject matter. There's bunch treatments it. scientifically minded [here's stuff comb really, best thing would seeing specialist. Oh well! 100% board hardline mandates public health safety issues.

The vaccine 36 months, given vaccines billions people worldwide pretty good history vaccines diseases understand one act. think we're suddenly going grow third arm 36 months? know long-term issues many infected COVID. I'd love see data shows watching ""Squid Game"" make kill exactly 1 year watched final episode. I'll wait. (See ridiculous sounds?)

The Public Readiness Emergency Preparedness Act invoked COVID vaccines due need expedited timeline. Companies like Pfizer Moderna going release product study years without protections place. said, still plenty research back safety vaccine hundreds millions people point receive vaccine safely.

COVID Vaccines huge market affects everyone planet. reason vaccines funded public money everyone needs one stay alive. kinds things funded government keep us safe. vaccine one example.

The vaccine CREATED public money, PURCHASED public money. Operation warp speed basically told companies ""make something prove works we'll guarantee big purchase."" needed increase timeline, basically gave means without needing waste time getting money together. could write best book ever written one's going read unless get editor, publisher, distributor, etc. lined up. basically said, here's money that, write book.

YOU one sold lie. know 97% survival rate means? means 3% people get fucking die! Multiple studies shown people vaccine 10x less likely hospitalized get COVID 10x less likely die they're hospitalized compared moron. Sorry, unvaccinated person. thing, really. Honestly, younger, unvaccinated kids higher risk catching becoming seriously ill covid vaccinated individuals, mask home helpful. 

I'm sure data really supports statement. People want take advantage medical science must abide medical science. almost certainly Emergency Use Authorization. It'll relatively quick mean rushed incomplete. similar situation WA, i'm really worried shit like play well future pandemic. there's strong possibility states refuse allow patients states next time around   may get lifelong effects COVID like lung brain damage. get vaccines, vaccines safe effective.

Exactly one enjoys sensation waterboarded.

I'm confused people choose it. don‚Äôt understand anyone allowed refuse vaccination military. Isn‚Äôt defying order? Ask. people hypothyroidism, Hashimoto‚Äôs autoimmune disease. 

I curious chilblains. kid gets live warm climate. autoimmune disease (one Hashimoto‚Äôs). COVID. sympathize situation, think you‚Äôre making educated choice. would too. Umm priority people paid it, developed manufacture it.

That's vaccinate everyone know one dude (army officer) Facebook posts insane stuff. sure got vaccinated yet he's constantly posting antivax garbage. nothing new. Responsible people picking slack bad actors since civilization started.

...however, nothing OP's complaint, mask requirements going continue forever mass deaths end, reply, aren't. folk still complain rushed it.  Schools empty one knew long would way long pandemic would last. hindsight things could done differently, time nobody knew going happen next. 

The engineering design phase HVAC project size take 6 months 6 months get equipment contractors lined up. actual installation half battle. point ask scientist study: kids die? badly hurt? work? brand new medicine. 100 million adults taken Pfizer shot aside rare serious side effects, pretty safe.

I ton nurse friends certain vaccines including flu vaccine every year.

My whole family military, mom retired ton vaccines military career. Last time deployed 2009, get series vaccines. 

During 2009 swine flu outbreak, lined troops gave swine flu vaccine developed tested 7 months without much resistance. 

These people used fringe social media manipulation (mostly foreign agitators, mostly Russia bot/troll farms) taken fringe mainstream literally killing hundreds thousands Americans.  ""You seem unwilling accept results studies vaccinated group contains individuals previous infection subsequently got vaccine.""

Firstly, ""if vaccinated group contains individuals previous infection subsequently got vaccine."" 

It ""if vaccinated group contains individuals previous infection subsequently got vaccine""

Secondly, accept results. results pertain whether vaccination ALONE provides better protection previous infection ALONE. address possibility previous undetected asymptomatic infection ""vaccination alone"" group, next part comment.

""If want find expert says study valid go ahead won‚Äôt hold breath.""

When recent comments said think Israel study valid? would really like know. idea trying claim point I'm trying make. point would possible recreate similar study, adjustments made address flaws pointed out. seem want believe study possible personal belief possible undetected asymptomatic infection ""vaccinated only"" group would render results invalid:

""I‚Äôm telling you‚Äôll never get ‚Äúclean‚Äù vaccine group it‚Äôs impossible tell someone asymptomatic infection never knew.""

How know certain effect would significant enough render results comparative study invalid? Please understand vast difference between:
-vaccinated deemed uninfected, possibly undetected asymptomatic infection
-vaccinated infected shown positive PCR result/ lab test

""I‚Äôve provided numerous studies viewpoints argue it‚Äôs reliable verifiable vaccination is.""

You provided studies show protection afforded vaccination alone reliable previous infection alone. way proven comparative study. think have, error.

""You‚Äôre arguing honor system self diagnosis sufficient experts disagree""

Again, point said this. Please inform have. think previous infection evidenced either positive PCR tests and/or antibody tests. 

""because it‚Äôs verifiable vaccination is.""

A positive PCR test antibody test verifiable vaccination. UK information stored database. covid pass need travel internationally go events, obtained following positive PCR test. information PCR test stored way information vaccination status, could done antibody results.  i've pronouncing like ""in'n'out"" (bio'n'tech) whole time apparently completely wrong lmao  correct. UI requires unemployed *through fault own* This.

And instead getting dirty money politics, we're treating corporations people grift more. We've living new Gilded Age. believe constructive dismissal would apply person capable performing job question company refused allow them. lot cases, federal vaccine mandate means employee qualified get vaccine shot. would comparable driver letting drivers license expire. skill, valid credentials go skill. putting leave, they're info kept current, maintain seniority, meet necessary qualifications, they're allowed work pay.

Recommend family friends always see MD/DO health issues. [If going believe CDC, believe anyone Thanks heads up! Yeah, wanted see stuff friends family posted. Apparently possible that. Literally worry surfaces, surface transmission something like less 1/10,000 cases. It‚Äôs thing.

Your pretend freedom really exist, global pandemic? Well, does. 

I'm thinking maybe ""ethics"" moral content putting pretend rights freedoms neighbors families health lives.

To fair, want government making lightning quick medical decisions affect 300M people. Something big analyzed carefully methodically. Vaccines non-zero side effect rate possible harm good boosters unnecessary. couple weeks ago.

One arm.

No ill effects. couple days fatigue. Yes. England 1853 (and around 50 years after) smallpox vaccination compulsory infants, opt-out, parents refused fined, put jail didn‚Äôt pay fines. add conscience clause eventually, expanded ability opt 1907.

The US went state state around 10 states (including Massachusetts) compulsory smallpox vaccination, states policies allowed regional authorities require vaccination. Holy Cow! aware this! chiropractor get local school board meeting talk realigning immune system make work properly claim adjustments cured HIV one patients.

politicians hesitant introduce restrictions unvaccinated people fear losing popularity. vaccination campaign promoted well enough lots people trust government. top that, conspiracy theories anti-vax propaganda (some russia) run rampant social media tv.

fortunately, last weeks new measures introduced limit access unvaccinated people restaurants, gyms, theatres etc. impose 8pm curfew waived people vaccine certificates, measures apply places 6/1000 people got infected last 2 weeks. new measures require workers certain fields get vaxxed well, pretty limited.

vaccination rates begun increase last couple weeks that, we'll see enough. wonder we‚Äôd see negative police behaviors also fall unvaccinated resigned/were fired? I‚Äôm interested statistics this... wear mask unless required local regulations store policy.

If three doses vaccine good enough stop wearing fucking mask, nothing is. Uh, think vaccine you? yeah read english! you? literally understand anything you‚Äôre trying say. know write full coherent sentences? Mandates death someone close thing I‚Äôve seen work. sound like 'fuck up'. decisions definitely reads moderna option would still using it. multiple options exist, one higher potential issue, use better one. getting vaccinated still presents great risk getting moderna vaccine. Pfizer vaccine presents even smaller risk. So, point choosing riskier option better option exists. Makes sense.

Background: Post-vaccination myopericarditis reported immunization COVID-19 mRNA-vaccines. effect accidental intravenous injection vaccine heart unknown. 
 
Methods: compared clinical manifestations, histopathological changes, tissue mRNA expression serum levels cytokine/chemokine Balb/c mice different time points intravenous(IV) intramuscular(IM) vaccine injection normal saline(NS) control. 
 
Results: Though significant weight loss higher serum cytokine/chemokine levels found IM group 1 2 days post-injection(dpi), IV group developed histopathological changes myopericarditis evidenced cardiomyocyte degeneration, apoptosis necrosis adjacent inflammatory cell infiltration calcific deposits visceral pericardium, evidence coronary artery cardiac pathologies absent. SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen expression immunostaining occasionally found infiltrating immune cells heart injection site, cardiomyocytes intracardiac vascular endothelial cells, skeletal myocytes. histological changes myopericarditis first IV-priming dose persisted 2 weeks markedly aggravated second IM- IV-booster dose. Cardiac tissue mRNA expression IL-1Œ≤, IFN-Œ≤, IL-6 TNF-Œ± increased significantly 1dpi 2dpi IV IM group, compatible presence myopericarditis IV group. Ballooning degeneration hepatocytes consistently found IV group. organs appeared normal. 
 
Conclusions: study provided in-vivo evidence inadvertent intravenous injection COVID-19 mRNA-vaccines may induce myopericarditis. Brief withdrawal syringe plunger exclude blood aspiration may one possible way reduce risk.

*The rate officer assaults 2018 10.8 per 100 sworn officers. (See Table 80.)*

Of 58,866 officers assaulted, 18,005 (30.6 percent) sustained injuries. (Based Table

You're hopeless. Peace bitches! 40% sucking horse de-wormer. maybe?   Yeah, said already, correct first 30 times posted it. need get basic understanding I'm saying 

I understand saying perfectly, wrong. people stop host virus go extinct like several flu strains last year. Think like fire there's fuel there's fire.

This ^^^, incorrect statement, many reasons others already given you. flat out, completely, totally, hilariously wrong comes Covid. 

I think time go find something else time, seem like getting it.  saw article almost draw like iron curtain see country doesnt trust vaccines want quit job they're idiots good them. airlines implementing mandatory vaccines federal government trying change CRAF contracts easier cheaper comply fight it. wonder many first shots Moderna actually boosters, well. would tilt numbers even towards boosters.

It makes sense though, imagine anyone getting first shot right mandate employer. Anyone else got shot months ago.  Indeed. ü§î nearly high 40% honestly, worst departure rate we've seen mandates federal/healthcare employees like 1-2%. screaming minority antivaxxers trying look tough. I‚Äôd say middle top society bottom society Seems police paid protect top society bottom moreover encouraged always observe division serve vs don‚Äôt serve regard given hypocrisy calling ‚Äúpolice‚Äù instead troops service corporate oligarchs  Thank you, forgotten 5 11s halloween target. That's maybe 4% though, moves target stuck around 65%.

To point, know percentage deaths gen-x doubled. (last summer: \~650 13000 5%. recently, \~170 1300 13%. made post last week links real numbers). number dead much lower percentage much higher. think 3 major reasons may case:

1) frail old people already gone. likely, since major portion old people simply contract it. Since we're longer shutdowns, think likely scenario.

2) delta variant dangerous gen-x. may true, explain percentage much higher. i.e. better killing 50 year olds, would think would better killing 70 year olds, too. percentage stay same, think would double.

3) Vaccination adoption among old people reducing deaths, people resisting vaccination prevalent among 60 crowd boomers.

ding, ding, ding! think favorite theory... Well‚Ä¶.bye Good. Get rid 2-dose regimen create enough cellular immunity fight infection; protection infection primarily driven antibodies. antibodies half-life. Fuck fuckers. Let em quit die American Airlines mandate rolled well, think late November deadline submit proof vaccination. 


The holdouts know resigned getting vax point, job searches, they're able easily find job get away unvaxxed (since think 100 employees vaccine mandate thing). 


Good. need get basic understanding I'm saying arguments keep throwing nothing point. keep infection rates low quarantining would decrease number future variants. 
Less variants= effective vaccines.
 Effective vaccines treatment= less sick people.
Less sick people = less corona virus.
 may still isolated coronavirus animals would result isolated populations Coronavirus. isolated populations could treated effectively letting burn thru human population denser mobile animal species. can't keep repeating assume dense. enjoy whatever view want dont make arguement something not.

I.e. want travel US, vaccinated.

Similarly US citizens need show proof vaccination want travel places need visa. Tell wrong thinking. figure people vaccinated area, Delta variant pressured evolve become contagious.  areas low vaccination rates, Delta variant incentive become even transmissible. idea ""they come door"" BS came from. even dictatorships ever done that.

At best, mandates always like ""if want X get vaccinated."" places existed long time! Heck, work hospital, school anywhere come contact vulnerable people, chances are, vaccinated already various illnesses. work contract. Sorry, done caring people‚Äôs feelings absurd beliefs. point adult come grips fact Wrong instead denying reality around you.

Where draw line firing workers refuse vaccination. Especially effective options working home bi-weekly testing.  Shhh, give ideas....

I vaccinated - got choice. inclined take away someones livelihood due making choice. public health concern - ok - knock patrol civic duties public safety. even docking pay bucks reassigned role doesn‚Äôt include public safety. lets drag mud like horrible people. 

But - thats opinion stranger internet. Feel free downvote oblivion one. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è data RKI. little reason use data.

Worldometers gets German data German newspaper (Tagesspiegel) compiles local regional data (analog method Johns Hopkins University uses times), dozens volunteers programmers. risks perpetuating mistakes way rather large.

Btw, Tagesspiegel data show new cases, 11,429 (that mistake must happened Worldometers' end). show 411 fatalities. obviously wrong. show RKI data, alternative data sources also support this. absolutely disagree get vaccinated. guarantee hard time filling ranks.

I'll answer much deadlier variant much infectious. would happen kept infection rates low allowed medical technology catch effective treatments effective vaccine? nice learned term 'strawman', probably get better grasp means. 

This frankly hilarious. get 3 year Covid lasts 6 mo probably still every year like flu 

This still answer question  actual valid religious exemption

When religious bullshit puts rest world risk dying plague, time start re-evaluating special privileges give religious bullshit.  Wow, really way past point return really need come understanding saying wrong. 

You mean eradication disease impossible easily spreads, lives animal reservoirs? No, that's completely correct, supported literally every scientist planet point. vaccines strain longer dominant mutations allowed, people eased lockdown restrictions.

Delta generated India, incredibly dense borderline third-world population ***literally quarantine*** access vaccines. Please try educate societal norms places India make nonsense comments like this. isolated communities high frequency virus controlled within human population take faster could adapt medically would much simpler eradicate virus. 

No, flat wrong. 

The virus eradicated quarantine soon isolation lifted spread resumes. point animal reservoirs, *it never eradicated* matter humans do, survive elsewhere begin spreading again. 

Seriously, need get grip. November 2021 -- dozens unarmed black men find shot! Tell know absolutely nothing organ transplants without actually telling me. Breakthrough case here. useful info timeline contagiousness vaxxed cases? 

I already feel much better day 3 symptoms, obviously I'm staying home staying away vaxxed family member tested negative. I'd like know need assume worst come isolation (seems like 14 days symptom onset originally, redefined 10 days point). guidelines valid mild cases go away days? *were*. **leading** said government. 

I use leading sense way *""leading""* government parroting whatever BS enablers feeding leadership. 

The issue celebrity politicians, Reagan, Trump, others similar ilk like pop celebrities, tendency surround enablers. hard second guess nobody tells bizarre ideas terrible. allow disagreement, allow checks echo chamber. 

Witness terrible decisions celebrities; favourite example Matrix: Wachowskis ""yeah, totally add huge rave middle part planet wide underground resistance movement, it'll great"". someone tell stupid? bet anyone got fired. 

Same thing happened. Anyone disagrees stupid celebrity gets fired, left enablers accomplices worse, something akin foreign asset handler. wonder donor match situation. donor gives kidney, donor gives kidney. partly employee, least places.

I'm advocating argue means throwing strawman arguments. Would okay first dose pfizer vaccine? kind afraid get second dose honest. Everyone talked said horrible second dose. I'm sure still better vaccine all. sure - I‚Äôm pretty confident regular people would feel way. that‚Äôs aren‚Äôt paid defuse situation people murder broke ass waiters America? one side, death debilitating long-term health issues. side, minor inconvenience protects oneself others.

Really, two sides learn compromise!  think you‚Äôre giving excellent example US police receive training police officers training always defending lethal force first solution GG Here‚Äôs hoping police abolish themselves. Right? That‚Äôs reason cop lol. Nothing wrong Scheduled today!

Barely felt fatigue first two Pfizer shots, hopefully I'll fine time well. 40% beat spouses? really need come understanding saying wrong. higher number host means higher chance mutation going thing keeps virus around. vaccines strain longer dominant mutations allowed, people eased lockdown restrictions. animal Reservoir theory everyone keeps bringing matter. Animals going traveling internationally Infectious rates humans population nearly dense (Pun intended). isolated communities high frequency virus controlled within human population take faster could adapt medically would much simpler eradicate virus. reason World Health experts saying impossible eradicate one following quarantine procedures idiots getting vaccinated. vaccines less effective new variants allowed spread less chance finding general. get think following basic safety protocols infectious diseases effective. would love see example Health Organization quarantining sick people, find one I'd love read it. hope so!

I need job! Fewer deaths shorter hospitalizations good, obviously, clear, Merck's treatement anything transmission. Pretty much yes Pfizer, anything else unless moderna specific set ailments. get 40% less cops, let's cut 40% less funding. That's one way defund police.  Lol üòÇ getting unemployment, hence social services needed. Nah, I'm sure plenty bad apples got vaccinated.  Yeah, understand saying perfectly, people already pointed out, flat incorrect. 

Also general we're talking variants (not variance), would realize chance variant makes vaccines useless incredibly low. That's also pretty well known point. Screw social media propagates false information. understand know informed anything level people creating/misleading/lying public. IMO  know long term consequences Tylenol, yet still take like crazy. Yes, see knew FBI warned protested cops attacked 40% America cheered. ""Stop resisting!""

Most people don‚Äôt know family shitty. People trust personal acquaintances anecdotes much impartial/objective source. someone endorsing/espousing idea like anti-vaccination friends going give benefit doubt time. 

Again, you‚Äôre looking point creator misinformation don‚Äôt need convince friends initial targets. need small set friends see rebroadcast message, travels. talk like know talking about, arguments pretty poorly reasoned. 

Better remain silent thought fool, speak remove doubt.  debate whether airborne come definition airborne. quite clear disease spread two people share breathing air. that's airborne means scientists: means air carry infectious agent, appear case COVID, droplets temporarily suspended air.

i responding question!!!!! PLEASE REREAD THREAD. So, far transmission goes, seems covid transmissible surfaces. Sure, might survive lab metal 24 hours, seem infecting people route.

Last I've heard this, seems Covid-19 mostly transmitted directly one person's respiratory system another person's. means essentially breathing air someone it. travels even better people yelling/talking/singing, particularly that's enclosed space. 

I idea heard said ""airborne like flu."" research I've read (as well anecdotal patterns personally know of) suggests even *more* airborne influenza viral particles are. Possibly due covid particles smaller lighter weight, surviving better directly breathed in.

I understand trouble believing anyone -- new research taking place real-time. tend look research epidemiologists versus listening media headlines, helps keep sane. might enjoy podcast called Podcast Kill You. focused Covid, though episodes it, great way understand diseases work general. Republican governors reacted furiously President Joe Biden said would require employees large businesses either get vaccinated COVID-19 submit weekly testing. Republican- Democratic-led states alike already require hundreds thousands citizens ‚Äì infants, toddlers schoolchildren, mostly ‚Äì vaccinated panoply diseases.

Is strange compare private businesses public schools? ‚ÄòMurica.  Bless heart That's interesting question. unscientific assessment friends family, people already making bad life choices and/or regularly break rules unvaccinated. Would correlation abusive police behavior unwillingness get vaccinated? Los Angeles Canada? OK then.... anyone get booster?

How worthwhile firing unvaccinated? seems unnecessarily vengeful me. FDA CDC WHO. care treatment regime safe cost effective.

Agreed, however outside advisory committee members it. obviously Also personal opinion, people saying hospitalizations matter dead wrong.

I think dead wrong. think face value makes complete sense first second shot na√Øve host developing world would overall good third shot US. However I've seen nothing suggests would actually play out. simply much goes logistics, etc. makes theory vs. practice. administration already committed billion shots donated mid next year. already said undoubtedly boost meet obligations. superpowers need step game too. personal opinion morality problem anything else. +/- 100 million boosters (for would want them) produced weeks. producing well 4 million per day spring, imagine capacity way now. screams equity cost. words ""if can't it, neither you"". wrong.  I‚Äôm inclined agree, police unions inordinately powerful, doubt happen threw 20 things one effect p&lt;0.05.    late flu season. takes weeks flu vaccine kick shot, flu season usually peaks holidays people spread gatherings. unvaccinated WELCOME refuse hospital treatments book.

Then, do, fire making false claim rather vaccine refusal. study focused people phase priority, extra susceptible. seen level waning general population. told kids would get go back Disneyland get covid vaccine, wait get shot. recent examples guide, probably see 40% whittle around maybe 10-12% deadline (especially told request religious exemption denied). push comes shove, grudgingly get vaccine, others decide take ""voluntary early retirement"", percent left suspended without pay.
