0,2021-11-25,"   reviews Michael Worobey’s dissection early COVID-19 cases Wuhan, discovery herpesviruses assimilate cellular kinesin produce motorized virus particles.  Quarantine? Cmon man that’s insane. proof vaccine pcr test. mean, what’s end game UK?

Let’s say compete Delta. UK isn’t going permantely closed border, it’s going get eventually, likely pretty soon. 

What’s value delaying couple weeks? It’s ultimate outcome.  far   vaccinations help variant? two variant. asymptomatic believe. Hopefully stamped out. forget towel!  suggest instead? Masks mandates, social distancing, limited capacity occasions, etc?

In US even dems don’t push things anymore, completely unsustainable. potential vaccine handle many mutations rate. lucky mNRA vaccines already developed influenza nothing exists (from knowledge) counter act multiple mutations rate. 

This serious issue. Wow cant wait US ignore /s 

I tired.  Makes wonder stop treatment covid patients certain timespan. patients like would die, hand, massive numbers people would saved killed new variants. Definitely hard ethical question. Nice thought theory, impossible reality: airlines massively intertwined safety. Safety something handled extremely poorly private businesses inevitably grows lax ""nothing ever happens, paying much this?!""


In general overhead trying build a-la-carte government would likely result greater overall expense simple ""everyone pays pot"" system many countries chosen.

So yeah: vegans pay meat plant inspections, pacifists pay tanks, people walk pay wheelchair ramps, non-fliers pay TSA, NTSB air traffic control. list goes implementing larger exact system would tons overhead.  Hey! South African here, two days ago peaked 1000 cases last night tipped 2465 cases day. cases definitely going again. Prior week, 800 day ( could wrong know Wednesday first time went highest it’s while).    like ""capitalist"" vaccines, go get ""socialist"" one China Russia. Oh wait, vaccines effective best ""capitalist"" vaccines? Shhh... Yup, variant truly much transmissible Delta, time identified already late. Department Health revealed Thursday night genome sequencing analysis confirmed patient, arrived city South Africa, another hotel guest tested positive days him, infected B.1.1.529 coronavirus variant. fully vaccinated.

There many questions: long ago vaccinated, vaccinated with, booster, etc. 

We know much yet hard know whether initiate Delta like world-wide wave. idiot know went Disney posted vitamins took essential oils used shield kids effected recently vaccinated  *sweats Eastern European*  variant already sequenced three countries. US holiday season, unfortunately. Why? Yeah know measures come pass without compromises support. cannot expect successfully introduce new travel ban vaccinated people.

Maybe wholesale travel ban, status check could still happen due B.1.1.529  see excess death graphs. Easily triple report COVID deaths.

We one obese, hiv tb infected countries terrible healthcare bad inequality. would surprised good fatality rate. Monday unrelated went away sleep ""socialism never fully implemented"" human nature cooperate comes personal expense, minority people ever it, unless threatened force   do. mean enjoy treated poorly. Feeling lightheaded week later. Flaring anxiety making worse. feeling lightheaded all? Oh also arm still quite ok, injection site. Lower. Elbow, forearm area. Joe ain’t malicious bruh  Yeah, I've flying regularly nearly 20 years, count incidents one hand, definitely seen flight attendants absolutely lose shit passenger warranted.

Your livelihood hands really bad day. week Pfizer booster I’m feeling lightheaded, it’s fueling anxiety making feeling worse. Anyone else feeling lightheaded week later? read forums people complaining 7 days dose 2 still feeling lightheaded. first sequencing lineage weeks ago. Scientific discussion seems go back 2 days ago. yesterday news picked up. 7-day rolling average cases South Africa tripled week, Johannesburg rise much faster. actually even long enough sequenced cases hospitalized yet us judge virulence.

The available information quite alarming. really much it. easily dismissed like...all of...the false alarms before. wait week see.

Get first/second/third vaccine dose, convince someone else to. South Africa 28% first-dose rate; vaccines work. Yeah Blackpool particularly special case odds ivermectin hdq studies populations high rates parasitic patients?  referring doctors upthread injecting dose rationality discussion. capacities better US. Unfortunately. New variant identified South Africa herd immunity last wave. (Which, however, may strong enough prevent wave) false sense security ... people vaccinated need take precautions

What saying? People vaccinated *are asked take precautions*. false ""sense"" security. current mode operation many governments. unfair putting blame individual individual told need vaccination go back licking others noses whatever *Gestures broadly every country world*  incredible sequencing capabilities owing work TB/HIV. going poison people taking label? Also no.

This verges medical misinformation.

I recommend unless trained medical professional, refrain giving medical advice, especially advice could get someone killed.  Let's first wait till spreads think it. That's done! thing think acting quickly would ban travel South Africa. that's hoping one variant left country already. 1 person did, already late.  US domestic carriers effectively ""lowest cost""? Like Delta might expensive, rate experience planes better flying Southwest.

The whole process across airlines seems designed make humans feel powerless, like cattle, they'll happily charge hundreds dollars thousands dollars it. Easy caps bucko own. Going road I've ever known They're going leave borders open like India weeks days get citizens home US like Delta variant. definitely worked here, got wanted, nearly collapsing healthcare system due variant wanted.

We'll probably see new strain wait weeks days.

Why government like this.  100% knew link would lead hope spreading furry. came backlash received lying credentials?? ""Here go again"".... Im getting booster soon rate...when end. saw Pfizer BOD guy MSNBC say point, could go new variant sample sequenced, adapt vaccine it, produce millions new vaccines ready produce billions 90 days. go FDA approval original one. expert, takeaway asking question is... yes, 3 months plus distribution time.

That like month ago MSNBC. Go Saw another thread wanted make sure noted. Best news I’ve seen today. likely see Nu full nAbs escape vaccines likely barely issues severe disease. encouraging. thread also shows likely won’t outcompete Delta. “ Can’t state still restrictions. Blackpool, UK? Fecal matter? Uhhhh ass dirty bro? Spoiler Alert: end dead point lives. think best could expect ""soaring"" low vaccination rate new variant reduces vaccine efficacy source looking? Please compare Wait see indeed. We’ve holding booked last week fly RSA leaving Dec 7 MIL ill felt might last chance see her… 
Something happen fear none good.
As say, wait see.
😔😞😥 fact people still traveling internationally pandemic insane me. like stupid? know fuck doing? 

You're guy computer home training medicine, experience government, awareness read reddit headlines. Fairness dosent matter. Preventing spread virualant virus does. Saw comment thread wanted make sure saw this… reassuring comforting pray case nu variant. likely see Nu full nAbs escape vaccines likely barely issues severe disease. encouraging. thread also shows likely won’t outcompete Delta. “  big heart sibling. Restoring hope humanity. said data dump. worrying however, displacement Delta undoubtedly Insurance ?   Cause alive go sleep Yes read correctly based total 77 instaces endemic means. fouled out.  Serious publications scientists never showing level concern one. UK already banned travel 6 countries, measure never took L/M.

It could still overblown, knows, early signs same.  Another interesting fact South Africa they've reporting high case fatality rate since beginning pandemic. commentators I've read say tend underreport cases high proportion population access testing. monthly strain! dystopian thing lol I'm starting think thing going around long time constantly hacking away killing small percent population ruining health many others. long long time? Penalties rarely deterrent effect. People think far ahead. death penalty stop murders, example. Tho fair, -8,000 people ~8,000 sq miles, almost automatic social distancing… meatheads Fuck. take booster today US likely follow suit months. Possibly. new variant lmao. recently told peer (I received vaccine already support vaccinations): said flush covid vaccine explained comparing getting bit snake prevent venom spreading. **It's right? say her? get resources/links/articles related statement?** Thank much advance help. Happy holidays. would take long time would difficult process. would also cost massive amount money. She’s prominent presence covid/virology twitter year huge following. fake grifter someone would exposed now. Username checks out. Pfizer make double profit go back months later start Delta though good starting point hop fitness level from. much can. mean uptake issue, quite disaster people anticipate. Ahh, nice live world look last 2 years world wide fuck ups early attempts reopening able make statements like straight face.

So sad... variant have?  may sound like strange solution, that's exactly gotta do. enforce vaccination. article states mostly unvaccinated driving surge mortality, distancing mask rules less stringent last year. 
It includes also significantly higher percentage people 30s 40s last year. seeing pattern. 
I watched closely since late 2019 / early 2020. 
I’ll tuned laser focus weekend seeing develops. hate people this. want reminded comment 10 days? rub guy's face he's wrong?  anti-vaxxer people use kind stuff proof science flawed

But course, fact ""vaccines cause autism"" research retracted, exposed outright hoax *not* prove whole antivax argument flawed.

It's standard thought process conspiracy theorists: evidence refutes beliefs criticized. theoretical evolutionary biology dropout (due illness, incapability) expectations indeed way transmissible Delta push Delta. said thing Delta found India people like 'don't worry, India, we're good here'; case heavily interconnected world like world today. !remindme 20 days Lol I'm 90% vaccinated country tell yet. Fucking hell read 4 different articles get good idea scientists worried transmissibility high variant. honestly even know best one send to, seemed shed bit light situation. They've sequenced 77 instances (that's sequencing, case load) province Gauteng since early November, every genomic sequence conducted variant. amount time, since early November, cases gone couple hundred day thousand day. assuming present outside Gauteng now. 

They're starting restrict flights require quarantine pcr tests get quarantine traveling South Africa. 

I saw first article post online yesterday skimmed assumed, like many, would probably another dud variant scary spike protein mutations low transmissibility. there's still chance relatively innocuous, really looking way, looking good, scientists known raise alarms often raising alarms right now. furry disqualify someone ""proper profile"", take attitude right back 2013 No. I'd rather die. pandemic end soon. refuse let life. explain further? basically Delta everywhere, variant take hold?  Chise extremely prominent figure covid twitter year. sort fake grifter someone would exposed now. knows shit I’m sorry upsets also furry lol Czechia 37% positivity rate seem hit 40% week end. spread others, like vulnerable loved ones visited holidays. People really like thing guess. protesting masks whatnot article says South Africa 1200 new cases day. county Midwest USA 23x cases per day, per capita. Either testing program sucks, they’re lot better mitigation. Ok. I'm abolitionist. Missed part it’s likely evade vaccines huh?   knew could happen world gotten vaccines Africa vaccination rate dismal. Maybe would prevented variants getting churned rate. Can’t update vaccine particular variant, worst came worst?  pretty eerily similar early 2020 started like. 
I’ll watching developments closely extreme interest.  
Whatever SOB turns capable of, really hope doesn’t turn set us back couple years. 
I guess happens get see quickly mRNA vaccines really “re-tooled” needed deal new threat. I've read paper accidentally talked gnome instead genome. Typo's happen. BBC reports giving extra dot. Canada accept challenge 
/s Boosters rest lives Hopefully new variant like new got new variants blew days one talked What's third base? Another vaccine inbound  I’ve got somethin you, snakes money says $1000 unsub /r/Coronavirus... guys suck back in.

Fuck. Pfizer concerned driving drug-resistant strains; people taking pill supposed quarantine. Mixing multiple drugs reduce chance. right nothing mutations people talking Nu. like iOS update. need one unless need one

This true iOS updates too. phone allow that. C-C-COVIDBREAKER  quotes tweet Bloom Labs saying *complete* immunity escape ignores next one says *most* escape we've seen variant.  Increased hospitalization fatality rates vaccinated sure sounds worse. good place ""which decision ethical""-type questions? Subreddit, Twitter account, etc. Specifically wondering whether friend staying quarantined elderly parents ethical going hotel good cleaning practices isolated possible etc estimate .8 incorrect. probably misunderstanding difference R0 effective reproduction number (R-eff).

R0 reproductive number population without protection. virus R0 .8 would able get ground due negative trend would impossible become pandemic first place.

R-eff reproductive number population protection, factoring natural immunity, vaccinations, masks, social distancing, more. virus wave peaks, looking R-eff less 1. Delta R0 around 8, could easily R-eff 0.8 wave peaks.

I believe Alpha R0 3-4 Delta 5-8, 9-10 significant improvement virus could similar game changer Delta was, drastic thinking. new variant delta UK seems 10% transmissible 30% less symptomatic, one hope I'm sorry deal this. lot us dealing sort experience long COVID. we're welcoming want sub  vaccines rendered useless. might offer protection, certainly completely ineffective.  pulling opinion from? looked beginning pandemic. US international travel $214bn per year. We've spent $4.52tr covid related expenses, lost almost 800,000 people. would definitely worth I’m sure fine, it, guys….  Don’t complain global warming hoax Honduran farmers come droves farmers California can’t grow anything... oh wait, it’s already happening would totally get it, even rushed get appointment late December. risk get shorter intervals reason decide 4th dose pull shit again. mean is, totally counterproductive discourages boosters among healthy vaccinated people likely end mild flu. Man, vaccine took months ago looking weaker every passing week. tired loosing hope things getting better, cannot see end this. scares though current vaccines going completely stop effective, even boosters. current vaccines might relatively ineffective new variant South Africa (which I’m positive already coming government won’t impose &amp; keep travel restrictions). 

I agree Long COVID, feel like needs emphasis figuring causes Long COVID long.   basic premise question wrong.  Yup!  UK already countries confirmed found in. 
Probably still late…   Fu*k officially want fucking die already. Pre-Nu ...more variants. America.        It’s already South Africa likely already around world. always case testing lag. 

This need kick high speed mRNA vaccine apparatus gear.  link,

*This new variant, B.1.1.529 seems spread quick! less 2 weeks dominates infections following devastating Delta wave South Africa (Blue new variant, 75% last genomes soon reach 100%)*

So seemed Delta longer dominant due new variant. Govt begging everyone get boosters 5 months time implementing stupid rules. can't make s**t up. Look Screen shot Emma person. Low incidence delta prior  issue took comment somehow “end” this. point can’t.  people like seriously still beating economic drum Covid restrictions?

Simple question? long-term economic impacts 5+ Million dead world wide almost 800k US?

What economic impacts tens millions Long Haul Covid?

What economic impacts Pandemic killing people millions making rightfully afraid traveling personal business needs? Fk shit Australia PBS means household collectively spent $1500 (or $320 concession holders) medication pharmacies year pay $6.60 (or free concession) per box rest year *inhale* North Sentinel Island? get die means. Yeah I'm pretty much ready log server. Dunno getting downvoted much. people want shitty limbo forever. Either literally lock people houses law restrictions. middling shit working. Yeah, please, someone give hope, don’t want go back living 2020. variant going reset everything? wasn’t. low case rate much compete with. makes feel better, it’s HIGHLY unlikely defeat vaccines entirely. hope! B.1.1.529/nu low case fatality rate three suggest, may good news even spreads much quickly delta did. South Africa lot testing per case US UK combined.   likely see Nu full nAbs escape vaccines likely barely issues severe disease. encouraging. thread also shows likely won’t outcompete Delta. “ Indeed, B.1.1.529/nu low case fatality rate three suggest, may good news even spreads much quickly delta did. South Africa lot testing per case US UK combined. I'm sorry, maybe add context. said rest world dirty job fighting pandemic wasting time bureaucratic crap like giving variants greek letter names, help much. truly wanted end thing approve Sputnik Sinovac vaccines, make assessment Covid pills, deliver vaccines third world. Instead, every week exact thing, keep whining ""boosters bad"", ""vaccinating children bad"". thing done naming variants fancy letter names.  I'm sick tired sick tired   Madagascar too.   seems Delta dominating variant emerged. . missed something tweet chain I’m sorry. way it’s end times said variant push vaccination efforts square zero. already though time booster shots cannot imagine outrage ignorant people require 2 doses new variant.  Merry Christmas filthy animals turns Resident Evil Dead Aim. know know.   dunno seems like lot opinions do. scientists think go based hospital cases, think restrictions continue zero covid. good maths well-informed. danger"" good thing annual boosters use target new variants. 

You need new shot new mutation, need annual booster date version vaccine possible. 3rd dose people receiving basically 1st annual booster, \*not\* used target new variants. 

Seems bad.  live Bermuda heading home time States. nice time visit, everyone excited holidays. kept asking people plans lovely hear folks excited families. straight deny entry US citizen territories? States can’t that. care getting covid I'm vaccinated? care getting sniffles. least enough go lockdown prevent sniffles. thing, younger healthier getting vaccinated part protection vulnerable advocating. Glad agree everyone get vaccinated. know living said post, scenario even job forced temporarily shut down, company would required federal government keep employee pay regular salary month, company receive funds government able well stay business. 

If said company shirks fulfilling requirement either pay you, lowers salary, fires you, would violation, federal government would give salary was, pay every week monthly.  Translation: ""I idea I'm talking about."" What? far know asymptomatic though, encouraging. things normalize

If idea would be. remember planning last spring, decided wait mid-late summer assuming would low point. Turns month Delta wave. matter? well squander  There’re whole bunch clinical trials. It’s exactly secret. would get booster 5 months 8.5?  long allready europe. find within next days weeks variant-specific booster would need shown significantly effective (against infection, hospitalization, death) booster original vaccine. Thus far, least Delta, case. Even Delta-specific booster effective regular booster. Maybe true new variant, that's there's less urgency targeted vaccines.  B.1.1.529 seems obviously *at least* variant interest (has genetic markers associated predicted increase transmissibility virulence, changes receptor binding, immune escape, reduced treatment effectiveness, diagnostic failures)

Whether promoted variant concern (direct evidence increase transmissibility, virulence, immune escape, reduced treatment effectiveness, diagnostic failures) issue weeks now. 

South African viral genome sequencers, well sequencing nations high traffic South Africa like UK, running nonstop weeks.    Covid 4, time it’s personal. Delta isn’t dominant SA right now….not much outcompete. 
I’m trying urge people stop acting like end times  new variant results square one I'm probably gonna Corona proved even ""community masks"" effective, usually much medical masks. live country low/no/poor vaccine availability. That's outcompeted means. environment Delta remained flat Nu grew high exponential rate. 

Unless environment.  EXACTLY! Thank you! fighting pay increase penalties! it’s novel. 

If think it, new virus infects humans first evolutionary pressure it’s going face going getting better infecting humans. essentially Petri dish selecting mutations better infecting us. 

Viruses endemic humans longer already picked “low hanging fruit” - simple mutations make infect us better. Furthermore, humanity prior exposure (and thus immunity) them, evolutionary pressure isn’t selecting ease-of-transmission rather immune evasion.  stay Holiday Inn Express last night ""Google friend.""

That's deliberately obtuse.

""Just break law cops judges anything you, bro.""

Just gonna deepthroat whole boot, huh? capacities better US

***looks burnt antivax healthcare workers***

\*chuckles\* I'm danger mistaken. 
All effective restrictions relatively effective, regardless contagion rates. compare Delta? compare infections disease Covid currently compared to?   Shouldn’t put fly list every airline? It’s odd don’t already get charged felonies that, there's also huge counterproductive incentive this. South Africa amazing job genome surveillance detect coordonate transparently experts worldwide. Governements elsewhere might inclined spend less kind scientific research thing gets travel ban. friend sent today got bit scared. kids getting second dose thought finally feel like get new variant! Strap folks. Get ready lock fire ye old money printer. holding gold, nows time buy in, countdown liftoff inflation rocket. Correct, meaning, theoretically, spike protein hasn’t mutated enough vaccine still effective. Israel making Early days yet, Australia drugs like would covered Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme cost heavily subsidised government. give example; needed antibiotics years back, paid $9 pocket prescription. Hi max. Enforced border quarantines success last 5000 years.

They aren’t haven’t effective disease contagious COVID is. 8 year old tested positive wife vaxxed get least show symptoms. 3 year old really lethargic couple days popped like normal. What's chances know it?  Ontop assault charges. throw 7+ years fly list 2022 looking dope  Even ban international travel, virus still somehow leak country. look China.
 strict measures air tight still get leaks fairly frequently. I’m telling downvoted dude. I’m gonna argue mean imply.  might getting downvoted people think you’re antivax troll. You’re clearly based history, trolls like say things like “15th booster now, waiting daily gummies” whatever way mock vaccinated people. 21st century egomaniacs want disguise faces frenzied flying monkeys follow graves. We're putting number African countries Red list today. Sunday travellers countries quarantine Variants always happen, happen frequently spread. People like majority.

And that's problem, reason we'll live (or occasionally die) foreseeable future. would chance new variant makes much less sick? know massive hopium, could also way pandemic course. 

Any data sick people get variant? example 80% people unsymptomatic, could also explain 'sudden' rise (since exponential growth much phase). 

Again, hopium, I'm looking data here. Faster spread bad healthcare infrastructure one main concerns seeing I'm overdue surgery year. local hospitals still clogged antivaxx idiots pretty dramatic effect care people chronic illnesses. Oh, definitely will. want to. going new delta?  Time what? world community failing again? Anti vaxxers fucking again? 

This anything variant considerably lethal Delta straight jacket  make sound simple logistics double vaccinating continent composed mostly third-world countries easy cheap.

And amount despot leaders really think jabs make way arms citizens sold countries? Ur mom mean UK even implement travel bans whole year late. take long, it? curious believe could severe. something makes believe that, bc possibility could go either way? original Hong Kong case received Pfizer May 13 June 4, actually recent 6 months ago. ???

Spanish flu much worse coronavirus - killed far people general, also killed far young healthy people.  lol imagine casually outing brainwashed Greece also impose 7 months validity ages 60+. happen next two weeks so. UK actually careful analysis finds cases variant. EU countries really analyze anything, overlook cases, ban non essential travel UK. hate much, stupid delta already.  'there concerns variant could cause severe disease.'

I seen realistic concerns this. assuming Australia trade rest world US control borders. False equating economy virus. major point keep hearing antivaxx friends vaccines useful mostly used enrich big pharma companies. say lockdowns continue regardless vaccination coverage. say vaccines developed extremely fast properly tested thus, won’t make huge difference. 

In beginning, would argue them, telling vaccines end ask get vaccinated. Now, see sense right. Singapore Portugal reintroduced restrictions. Now, new strain mutations delta.

So, vaccines solution, is? optimistically low Bit hasty there, champ. 'bout sleep it.  Also one detected samples Hong Kong linked someone travelling back SA. 77 fully confirmed cases Gauteng province South Africa, four cases Botswana one Hong Kong (which directly linked travel South case sensationalized news really something need worried about? feel like Xth time I've heard variant ""interest"" turned ""not interesting"". seriously need fly lists people…

I flew UK recently man sittinG behind decided half way done mask. flight attendant came ask put response “or what? You’ll pull kick out?” best stay isolated wear mask! pandemic isn’t over!   I’ve reschedule trip Japan (Tokyo Takayama) 4 times already. Really hoping get go April fellow Americans seem like keeping around long possible. Probably though, given majority major advertisers references coronavirus advertising blacklists happens travel restrictions place. real quarantines (like China Australia had) second third world countries. Thank laugh!  share link said 90% poz tests SA variant since discovered?

I haven’t read yet would like to. wear masks sanitize hands public places force 

Still better US Possibly. 

It's definitely spreading now.
Is Hong Kong
Israel.
South Africa 
Botswana..

It's clearly countering delta America never really locked like Australia did.  Tell yes flush get flu vaccine around time, redirects immune system focus flu vaccine, blocking potential ill effects covid vaccine. Win win. 
Or honest ask specifically sources heard from, find together they’re credible. even would “flush” vaccine? Immediately cut arm like nanosecond get shot? it’s in, it’s in. (Which good). ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ issue then? Israel found first 3. Came country known variant now. Malawi something next one 3rd one india 

how hell guys reach 4th 5th? possibility still *very* premature. long Covid definitely heart/lung damage and/or chronic fatigue, people fully recover months. sucks, it’s long recovery, lifelong disability simply determined time. clear still speculation.

This article least points new spike increased transmissibility, could (hopefully) less deadly/impactful.  cut travel almost entirely. mention vaccine lowers severity decease.  
It's pretty clear Covid stay long run, thus must adapt rather expecting exterminate it. possibility Nu contributing high volumes Germany? Oh dear god happening, going global.
Hopefully resistant current treatments.  real life computer game, closing economy real consequences real people. Yeah genuinely give fuck point. I'm getting booster week parents half mind protesting idiots leads another round lockdowns etc. Keep pushing pills boosters dealing endemic neverending. vacinne might rendered useless variant 30 muatations protein spikes shitty UK response Brexit is, response COVID pretty good. least wrt discovering variants. wish response national level good.  may know much Africa there's children too, think. Honestly Europe taking precautions like masking social distancing pretty low risk least lower anywhere TX am. partner got back France end October itbseems people still taking precautions. Well predictable winter surge. course America consistently 4 weeks behind Europe since beginning mess. know I'll keeping eye European countries respond NU variant adjust accordingly given higher vaccination rates there. Looks like time order masks back medication (not horse paste) international trade takes another hard hit. Probably time buy new reusable N95 set well since stuck public transportation. SA enough vaccines. much antivaxxers though. like delta variant somehow spread africa. (hopefully doesn't) hope, I've reading quickly totally outcompeted Delta South Africa. week since discovered become close 90% positive tests, took many weeks Delta achieved. Even virus wants option 1  doubt uptake high time around, people going crazy becoming sceptical Heh, couple anti-covid drugs hitting next month, we’ll see fare. resistance least USA 1918 mask-wearing efforts. I'd bet someone dug old newspapers Europe elsewhere, they'd find anti-maskers areas, too. 


I think main reasons resistance due connected (social media) divided (bad people political arena).   mean US stuck people Wuhan Diamond Princess onto military bases quarantine. Hawaii pretty strict quarantine rules.  not, sorry. time buy GME late, enough countries blocking flights. really wanted stomp out, everywhere would stop flights everywhere else. won’t ever happen. Eastern Europe? Never thought I’d root delta go delta! Show fucker dominant are!

Seriously I’m fucking tired see hopes getting crushed again. October 2020 onwards. Delta became prominent early 2021. really bad world whole, bad individual case basis.

If take simple preventive measures like washing hands mask might prevent getting all, get odds getting seriously ill really low, even take shots boosters indicated, plus we're discovering new way combating time tons different treatments. family got COVID good time course, nothing serious happened.  I'm laughing panicked sound vaccinated Africa. SA less infections going every European country.

The situation variant nice ofc  like game Plague Inc anymore...  I've ordered ffp3 masks today. Shit. :( Definitely combination factors doses got Africa far late honest. One big factors also SII unable export India's issues. They're restart December looks like may late.  left us cliff hangar, pausing time point aged characters lol 4th time's charm course it. But, Delta someone infected pass around 8 people. 40% reduction brings 4.8 new infections, still higher many new Alpha infections would occur someone contracted it. Welcome never ending loop Nu Thread Sure, it'll slow things down! I'd rather one index case month so, slips through, constant flood them. Remember exponential growth based number existing cases.  wife works ER, keep saying guys need bouncers. Sorry, escape variant one (current) vaccines don’t work against, correct?  vaccine targeted new Nu variant would provide less protection previous strain, like Alpha Delta. soon vaccine protection strains wanes, would surge even we're protected strains like Nu. seen source it. far know twitter stuff.  [The vaccine works delta little bit less effective. Slowing better nothing. think mortality rate higher. biggest thing look for. However, know sure. Ffs. Seriously. can’t wait “I’m going let so-called CDC tell live life! won’t live fear!” people overrun hospitals they’re feeling ill suddenly scared dying. want sick

I good news offer is, crowd news (not saying eliminate it) content makes smile/laugh, get pleasure day. we've got, really. people ""very unreasonable hysterical""? Sounds like there's legitimate cause concern. Sorry what? Oh good lord.   Well alternative see something like national level referendums. carry locking let covid thing. aim UK stop hospitals becoming overwhelmed. happens again? draw line let covid patients die community reserve hospitals anything covid? Sounds pretty grim me. mistake. twenty-twentytwo. twenty-twenty. Two. Simple miscommunication. load bs comment. ""It kill every possible host"". know viruses work ? hosts left virus goes extinct. virus' interest Nature perfect let happen. Viruses evolve become infectious possible lesser extent, become less virulent time live symbiosis hosts. difference recovered vaccinated mostly immune Delta. Might much worse Nu. monoclonal therapies useless now.  read article ago office Pfizer get test every new variant current vaccine. Let’s see find new variant (nu it’s called, catchy delta maybe catchy actually know mean ) help viruses replicate hosts die.  already explained ignorance leads people anti-vaccine ultimately caused corruption resultant damage society.

Your last paragraph proves point. Capitalism merely way health progress. already said lacking democracy part problem - obviously that's part corruption, keep people control instead informed part decisions. Hey! Thanks joining AMA! fake account someone spent past 22 months can, arguing relatives, constantly cleaning masking reached end trying. idea amount vaccines literally distributed world wide fast enough far fetched it’s fantasy. Fibrosis lasts lifetime. Scar tissue organs simply go away. were, Bangladesh.  I'm pretty sure ""hysteria"" 2 years shit countries finally decided game plan new variant appears, countries act quickly fuels hysteria. understand really good data variant.    say, right, making things pretty hard. could given recipe know guess much incentive rich countries     expected try stop transmissions. “And darkness decay red death held illimitable dominion all.” neither, seen lots smart people warn mutation, using bunch words really get, something scary already predicted AI evolution simulating software. don’t think come like Damm - goes plan. Sure, let’s downvote comment point authoritarian government propaganda machine serves purpose. pro Chinese bots jump great firewall  mutated 10 times compared delta 2. Israeli PM announced state emergency. probably worse Delta legit. Apparently someone Israel tripple dosed contracted virus still. No, it’s everywhere, it’s covid No, need ban flying, switch system people fly get permit get pressing, valid reason travel.   magic internet.  Yes, get it. Maybe could given recipe know Chinese could making instead old good inactivated virus vaccines. competition inability colaborate. Pfizer moderna make billions things, need faster expanding production. told isnt point get booster show original vaccine job. body knows make antibodies fight virus. truth this? Yes, necessarily translate severe disease. really know much point, know quite mutations spike raises concerns whether immune systems vaccinated individuals able recognise virus.

We even know whether new variant higher transmissibility yet. need wait see plays out. Stay safe ya'll. maybe case widespread testing? cases skyrocketing way past previous waves, deaths seem low compared previous winter. maybe that's vax  Seems like. possible scientists create new vaccines stage unknown variants? impossible know dangerous variant without affecting person? Thank god someone said it. manyvpeople acting experts Yep. That's magic mRNA vaccines. premature foolish. wait see date service, sake mental health people “sound alarm bells” unless data don’t 2022~2023 gonna scary. fuck.   see point, honestly strange variant particular gotten much coverage alarm bells scientists compared variants. Something seems particular variant. Idk. definitely one follow. Yep, that's I'm too. I'm coming quarantine got infected. whole family got it, double vaxxed. sucked, none us close bad, felt like really bad cold, even grandparents. Honestly ill keep getting boosters come, let go back normal life let infected deal comes listen him. large number mutations relative original virus. already looking like vaccines make asymptomatic like Delta Motherfu*ker      get sick? need first know disease severe evades vaccines. Then, extent. good case moderately evade vaccines. moderate case would severely evades vaccines infection evade both. absolute worst case scenario evades almost completely, case see serious horrors.  person guys tweets specifically conclusion: lots evasion like Delta total evasion, AZ holds well neutralizer, still reduced sickness vaccine, data suggest high transmissibility Look damned comments thread. It’s like people leaping HOPE lockdowns come back. I’ve seen time time again. thinking gain functional mutations work like Ebola degree patient? Thats nightmare fuel right there. sure could work way, even idea bothers lol. anyone post source 500% competitive advantage? want learn it. Lol Hospital collapse care think. sufficient supply Namibia, Pfizer doses expire. overwhelming vaccination hesitance skepticism.  Communication virus vaccines nothing shitshow. People lack tools rational thinking failed politicians, media called experts. make buck. Good hear.

Antivaxxers may another bad time. really big deal? like planning road trip know going due oil change away home. either get oil change early and, may cost effective, worry trip *or* get oil change late get home, saving money increasing risk breakdown unfamiliar area. mean, boils risk adverse someone but, end day, need get oil change either way. become endemic. learn live like flu time analysis yet. Nu first sequenced Tuesday sample November 11th. Cases South Africa tripled last week, there's weeks total data - thousand total cases. Yeah felt way since early 20202020. Even delta concerned confident vaccines would work would get without many restrictions high vaccine uptake. I'm actually worried variant means though control something ro perhaps ten?  It’s better slow plan fight figured out. would sequenced there. 

i read likely evolved HIV patient Botswana elsewhere southern Africa. 20.3%, Botswana fourth highest HIV prevalence world, South Africa, Lesotho 19 mandates barely followed half-assed (go subway live rule never enforced), people getting sick it. Maybe rumored covid 22 speculated summer?  mean he's wrong connections exist, yeah market volatility necessarily indicator 16 years; problem covid particular spreading infected people presymptomatic mildly ill. means much selection pressure become less deadly, spreads perfectly well is. 

It could still become less deadly mutation think that's something we're crossing fingers for, suggesting inevitable likely scenario previous viruses necessarily accurate--they different selection pressures working them. New name expected sometime today, according article. !remindme 20 days  Good points! thing giving hope right hasn’t found (yet) countries going severe Delta wave right (i.e. Germany). spike cases driven variant, would’ve heard already. Even another lockdown possible richer countries, there's never going global lockdown, meaning regions world always breeding ground new mutations. People poor either lock almost certainly die starvation (100% fatality rate) risk virus 100% fatality rate.

Even western world would massive social unrest we've already seen. It’s probably esl tbh. Give break Travel ban won’t damn thing. Depends people vaccinated. Clearly, evidence shows declining immunity, especially 6 months beyond. Without boosters, people going breakthrough cases, though seemingly still reduced severity.  feel like we're point ""science"" trusted ""the science"" politicized. thought endemic meant “this good it’s going get” terms pandemic ever ending Right vaccinated tourists allowed in. Returning Israelis aren’t need quarantine. made whole Africa red flights cancelled. hope that’s enough.  saying comparable, pedantically objecting said Yeah.

Most call Nu-variant though. IDK BBC calls South African. get official name pretty soon, Nu another Greek letter.  think it’s infectivity levels make threat healthcare system. end don’t think Delta alone severe Alpha, spread quicker India meant people died. won’t March 2020 again, even be. words, 2022 new 2020. WTF saw alpha delta increased transmission rate serious thing itself. might put people hospital previous variant, puts in, say, month opposed six months big problem. hospital capacity infinite increased transmissibility worrying thing, bit unfortunately that's are. study discussing different ways presenting vaccine efficacy pointing different presentations sound less impressive, eg relative risk reduction gives nice big percentage (95%, hooray!) whereas absolute risk reduction effect sounds small (only 1.3%??? Vaccines lie!). Ironically, propaganda image exact thing paper warning pretending RRR ARR different levels vaccine efficacy instead different ways presenting data.

I suggest highlighting part paper, discusses less abstract measure vaccine also used derive estimate vaccine effectiveness,  
is number needed vaccinate (NNV) prevent one case  
COVID-19 1/ARR. NNVs bring different perspective: 81  
Moderna–NIH, 78 AstraZeneca–Oxford, 108 Gamaleya, 84 
 J&amp;J, 119 Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines.

Also ask anti-vaxxer relative explain exactly think ARR percentages mean. What, precisely, 1.3% 0.84% measuring? Reduction infections? Reduction transmissions one infected individual? can't answer (and almost certainly can't) shows understand data enough use base opinions on. 

(Even better, ask ask person got question) think late now. vaccines thrown away unused expired, really think they’d suddenly able freeze time ship across world use still viable? well beyond caring anyone vaccinated. far tell protection also wears off. Everyone getting covid inevitable mean try minimize damage causes. Netherlands, preparation terms additional facilities/hospital beds/ICU beds particularly shit. Yesterday escalated new 'phase' meaning almost planned operations canceled. virus r 9-10 like one it’s probably everywhere  good sea countries time respond fast. suspect already spread (I think detect variants spred quite lot) nevertheless positive reaction time decreased, helpfull general. read somewhere flu pandemic 1957 eventually mutated become flu pandemic 1968. Yes, highly mutational viruses tend become less lethal time, linear process. infection, covid antibodies, climate change fever. Mother nature trying rid human virus. can’t really know confirmed cases compare earlier strains. I’ve kinda grid regarding posting virus since end last winter’s wave. Pretty much fatigued done arguing.

I’d say first time I’ve “ah shit” moment may run variant render current vaccines ineffective. HAH.

Nanoseconds friend. Hate point out, probably want close borders strategy methodology deal new strain.  

If everyone drags feet, turns infectious reported, every day close early turn weeks longer stay closed. Hoping #2, years office work left completely ill equipped total societal breakdown. variant didnt kill immune compromised person despite long time. Thats good information, right? would mean variant dangerous, Might containgous become dominant, typical flu sympthoms mortaility.  He’s doctor epidemiologist  damages central nervous system.

Recovery long slow some, much like stroke patient. damage repaired, body adjusts time. would encourage anybody concerns nu head r/covid19, tend pretty good removing comments speculation differentiating concerning data yet. thread topic locked, number good amount well-reasoned, sourced, cautious panicked reasoning it. not. fear mongering. vacinated fine  No, sounds like fancier way saying thing. Praying every god believe variant way less mortal. way get infected quicker, fewer deaths, kills delta, becomes endemic. Wasn’t originally concern delta? RIP Africa guess  go again. Sorry, heard panic

Signed, populace. somehow difficulty breathing oxygen levels 99%, weird us never left Nu Delta Variant: NuDe Variant ;0) 🚀🚀🚀 💎🙌 honestly think pandemic ever end, virus faster speed human stupidity. Brain dead take Delta Plus, too? 2 scenarios last mutation I, absolute layman, mind:

1) highly infectious non-lethal mutation emerges covid becomes equivalent common cold
2) highly infectious slightly lethal mutation emerges die !remindme 10 days country live in? actually plenty people groups actively opposing masks safety measures time. People changed, technology allows dumb people spread terrible ideas much easily greater audience.   Perhaps it’s transmissible less deadly, perfect!  Don’t know grow trees? health experts called mandatory vaccinations Germany, Lauterbach simply politician background health sciences, neither doctor researcher. whole lot worse one’s big one. like going classroom taking poll see kids like superhero characters **only** asking kids wearing marvel dc shirts. Like yeah that's going provide data commensurate overall population point they're actively seeking new variant read competition variants. cases. Whether new variant comes already high wave previous variants lul. year even worse one before.  Annoying see ""South Africa"" variant. first one spot best capacity region. Similar British variant, happened spotted first they're good it. /end rant can't see family? Disagree, like citizens fodder economy, throwing bodies mill capitalism Want get anti vaxxers? Mask wearing disputed going back antiquity. People *always* hated told what's good them. 

We're species total morons failed upward sheer luck numbers alone. people likely get vaccine get it, people refuse still get it, allowing mutations. make seem scientists' seen new variant understand seeing panicked unnecessarily panicked journalist happening.  !RemindMe 3 months Mutations protein spike necessarily bad thing, lot anything. fact make less serious. Thats totally dumb. live place delta went crazy dont even people hospitals covid anymore. Vaccination. New variant dropped!  ‘bulletproof vest’ causes health effects?  want go back office? Mutations random  \*its article reply mine removed bot ""misinformation"" reposted Well, got 10 days quarantine wife ahead then, I'm reading right. track trace called yet? Regardless, sakes would mind starting now? one quoted R0 9 10, 40. Covid made great pool player. Used absolutely dreadful, never miss. pretty mild covid, go hospital, experience brain fog scary symptoms basically stroke. cleared, like flipped switch brain fix hand-eye coordination. Better soccer too. video games. want play anymore. Regional climate weather makes significant difference America. whole country surge once. southern states went wave earlier waning now. Northern states numbers generally increasing. holiday season started yesterday, expect cases go almost everywhere new year. think one worst states Michigan right now. Compare Germany them. reporting numbers right holiday weekend. pretty interesting body research this, referred “transmissible vaccines” “viral vaccines”. vaccines “live” thus can’t transmitted, transmissible vaccines used past. think oral polio vaccine transmissible, though don’t know contagious was. 

Pros viral vaccines would greater population coverage also ability spread vaccines among animals, could help wipe huge virus reservoirs wildlife. Cons would threat vaccine mutating spread, also ethical concerns would method.

In case, it’s something that’s researched! I'm scared Nu much idiocy public &amp; inability politicians exert type leverage corporate interests point.

It matter best long-term approach would be, they'll throw us meat grinder make quarterly profits.

Profits people. Reddit.com everybody. would need happen around entire world exact time would near impossible enforce. completely agree, needs medical staffing help take strain current employees. Nurses paid worth make livable wage burning financial strain too. military budget inflated many years.  Yep. least mRNA vaccines short development window. empathize (although I'm one Americans ... :), but, honest, asking vaccine seem like lockdown me, USA twice many (\~2,400/million) deaths compared Germany (\~1,200/million). 

COVID seems come waves, synchronized. USA bad couple months ago, 'everybody' gotten delta :). Also, may realize COVID restrictions USA local level ... California probably looks lot like Germany :)

I think COVID fact life, think means vaccine mandates, masks restrictions ('lockdowns') also fact life. think that's telltale sign *could* rough months. Ever since Delta came earlier year, variant concerns, nothing like this. DJIA \~900 points media sites variant front center. Fingers crossed bad seems could be.  Seriously? thought read vaccinations decreased 85% hospital admission. barely remember hearing much Lambda tbh Climate change solve climate change too. There’s still lot gather…the main cause concern 30 mutations spike protein. still, even information, still don’t know effect vaccines. fear cause lose effectiveness grounded fear amount mutations has. Again, symptomology. fully asymptomatic, would spread faster. soon symptoms present, isolation starts. point less severe strain spread due actions. choose this, pressure there. Even less infectious delta kept infecting people longer, would take over. Sadly, teacher US, part watches outbursts thinks ""hmm, feels familiar."" absolutely prevent infection.

Yes 100%. person responded simply said vaccine mean can't infected. true. mean, Twitter. expect? Yes, sarcasm. Hi bit Australia ZERO covid, travel bans fact work pretty well! think many European countries 30-70% hospitalized patients vaccinated. disagree, panic always appropriate.  market reactionary always be. Institutions sell news wait dust settle. Retail investors panic sell see market tanking. cycle perpetuates stabilizes.

It matter early panic far markets go. Shit really? feel like person separate account vaccine related stuff instead one twitter account lol  Ok, fine partially right hell, WHO's COVAX mechanism still vaccines supply Africa, also painfully slow distributing them. COVAX's slowness crucial factor well. Worst case scenario virus immune current vaccines Regardless quality US Government response ultimate pandemic, still lost poorly regulated wet markets like one found Wuhan continue lead zoo-viruses. 100% consider China fault virus considering international wet market standards large accepted followed across world. 

Does China poorly regulated wet markets? No. position global commerce far reaching effects COVID-19 demonstrated.  ruin Christmas? Those people politicians, think polls!  We’re 1000 away hitting 800k 😬usa!usa! One question have: assuming caught Egypt? Who’s say didn’t catch Belgium week returning? Hope shift R&amp;D worldwide therapeutic research don’t see cycle new variants letting anytime soon. Need ready treat people vaccines catching up. still wise limit travel. Virus initial growth always *slow* first weeks/months. Importing cases could devastating. point think goal getting time receive updated vaccines, normal antivirals (Molnupiravir Paxlovid work matter variant) hope variant bad science always one step behind virus. politics always two steps behind. policy always three steps behind

We know, see start pandemic, cause alarm. News reserves several days ago South Africa absolutely tourist hub… around 17 million visitors year pre-COVID, almost United Arab Emirates mentioned.  I’m expert, honestly wouldn’t expect less deadly. doesn’t seem like there’s lot selection presssure SARS-CoV-2 less deadly. would love wrong, I’m resigned possibility. trying get information new variant Twitter, dear lord twitter horrible actually gathering information. people whining shit like ""you're bigoted towards Soutb Africans!"", ""a new variant time midterms"", ""this variant never would happened people worn masks"" shit like that.

Very little actual information, bunch idiots idiots. React how? think response be? thinking along lines horrible ripple effects already affecting everyone around globe. Supply chain issues causing prices inflation increase, issue combined packed hospitals creating environment people can’t get medicine care, media sensationalism fueling anti-vaxxers, name some.

Your point taken, personally think broader damages hysteria great.  You’re triple vaccinated thinking cancelling trip? That’s crazy. You’re well protected, absolutely reason stop travel plans quote used antivaxxers Poor people need rich people go countries spend money. God live bubble. Looks like issues sort out. Yup, that's want believe. Places highest vaccination uptake places highest number cases. Lol, vaccine verrrryy effective. Can't wait get 22nd booster shot next year 😄😄😄  certifiably untrue learned Madagascar. even serious? march 2020 lmao. People go lives 99% probably privilege. Without modern medicine, covid could also kill people pretty quickly. Interesting see [21j fall sharply SA new 21K variant increases. everything saw, nothing changed. pretty much effect. thing lockdowns achieve infringement rights, fear. simply effect covid. distinction is, describing dumb money panic he's describing smart money moves...

The entire reason groups called smart/dumb money point. Look ownership %. recall much media hysteria since beginning pandemic though. Yeah never really lived name. attitude  last line defense

Did mean say shouldn't? top, Prof Balloux said Nu diversity already points first case around 3 months, 2 weeks ago. start 0 2 weeks ago, pointing much lower R0  Don’t forget take advantage Black Friday toilet paper deals Buzz offf waiting remake.. Shhhh! thinks he's winning! national public health departments (like Canada's) accepted idea Covid mainly spread longer lived aerosol particles, mainly emitted asymptomatic / presymptomatic infected. 

The WHO, particular, dragged feet this, pushing spittle/droplet responses months ago. Nothings gonna stop except either getting everyone vaxxed get it. Pfizer, initial two doses hte time infection. never knew terrible people judging risk prior pandemic. Watching average joe try understand risk based estimated fatality rate alone shameful. mention morbidity gets completely ignored. 

Polio low overall fatality rate extremely contagious high percent asymptomatic cases (up 70%). ignored morbidity focused mortality ~1/200 (still less 1%!) people end paralyzed would ignored. Somehow everyone understands polio vaccine important still don’t understand COVID vaccine is. Waiting Sigma variant 💪 Way early panicking without actual data. What's R level, severe it, vaccines protect it. know transmissible country 27% vaccinated.  Right, issue COVID isn’t particularly lethal first place. That’s it’s almost perfect virus. It’s deadly enough cause problems, much makes hard spread. Add ability re-infect, it’s serious winner virus don’t think *has* become less severe succeed. breed quicker kill us, always hosts. South African Diaspora found world, like coming going I'd say yes, probably. don’t want downer here, headlines certainly aren’t suggesting this. I’ve reading 30+ mutations. Greatly effecting spike proteins vaccines based one. don’t recall emergency meetings called previous variants. don’t ever recall reading scientists raising alarm bells red flags like before. Well theory much deforestation leads outbreaks, there’s less biodiversity land buffer wild animals humans. yes, nature trying get rid progress made, wont back square 1. sure of. 

It hard feeling suicidal need reach someone sake sake family. uncle conductor train comment upsets me. need snark. small, private religious schools small classrooms low vaccination rates amongst staff students, plus low mask compliance even mandates.

This least surprising news ever. know parents send kids schools attitude /shrug get COVID they'll probably fine. Which, statistically, true. yeah. Everyone schools exposed least 1x school year guaranteed. Hey, comment 6 hours old stuff seems pretty damn crazy right now. awake 6 hours ago wrote comment, though. saying HIV+ women SA Nu variant variant gained 32 mutations. really don’t understand guys’ argument likely didn’t start SA. first reported cluster cases linked new variant, I’d look epidemiology outbreak trace virus origin. likely South Africa. Like said viruses mutate deadlier variants populations immunocompromised serious issues diseases. Also political economic state country well lack government control, sanitation poor public health would make breeding ground deadly variant emerge. much simply contract tracing comes origins, I’d trust science people denial virus started country. Maybe pride don’t wanna face restrictions lockdowns outside world. not. Using argument style though, would instead condemn death hospitals?  absolutely prevent infection. Look whatever report want, I'm pretty sure find there's lower infection rate vaccinated unvaccinated population. New thread furry Moderna scientist stating real evidence outcompeting Delta vaccines likely still effective: optimistic? what's point banning travel 5 Southern African countries, except destroy tourism economies? Forever? ain't gonna work either buddy, back square one variant checkmate humanity. No, actually CDC misreported numbers. Seriously, look up, admitted it.

But people still believe that's want think. Unless protease different, Pfizer's protease inhibitor work, bigger Amazon. It’s individual countries rules. even then, people slip cracks, it’s inevitable. Plan world live in, one wished lived in. Tough times call tough measures, friends. allies would war scared hurting somebody's feelings. vaccine party, amigo. Nope understand that's read news, localized. Plenty states quite well. no-brainer right now. *If* majority cases Guateng, SA means spreading fast rate must contained much possible. 

We time wait scientists figure much evade vaccines monoclonal antibody treatments. Serious question. What's proposal? get vaxxed? Hi. I've got weird question.

I live jurisdiction 3rd dose boosters administered. Eligibility limited one requirement six month period since second dose.

Given new variant concern shows potential escape variant, Pfizer announced expect [able adapt mRNA vaccine within six weeks ship initial batches within 100 days event escape - best strategy going forward?

We're talking people already fully vaccinated since possibly summer. Presumably fourth booster that's tailored new variant would also require time previous dose vaccine. want discourage anyone getting whatever vaccinations - question get 3rd boosters potentially wait longer variant specific booster later, wait see current vaccines perform new variant getting third dose?

For record, detected new variant yet - we've super lucky avoided well. recognize choosing timing third dose extremely First World Problem, still would like advice makes sense now. smart money moves, hedging risks.The poster implied people large stake knows next catalyst. Literally impossible data now.

Its far likely portfolios readjusted another downturn. No. saying flu major risk elderly immunocompromised?  get it. We're missing basic information SA have. people detected mu strain, many double-vaxxed? (I know vx numbers low SA, 25%, still meaningful). vaxxed got many ended hospital vs cold?

Those two important things know right easily. divulging it? asking lot, could someone explain current scientific consensus regarding transmission? understanding virus transmitted primarily aerosols despite thought back first started. risk transmission via fomites minimal.

So, virus variant nu called much transmissible, know might so? less virus air infect people? 

Is consensus this? Ah yes mythical networking coffee maker. unicorns prancing office well? Regurgitation implies lack consideration factuality. “Scientists always pawns military” — late David Marcus never going end, right? Thanks, anti-vaxxers. dont think *worry* helpful stage. aware maybe motivation get booster shot.

Of course, armchair reddit experts assure watchful thing fearmongering, guess things black white.

Get shots, get booster can, realize virus endemic scared, take necessary precautions. There's reason go scorched earth.  Pfizer booster me. Whole body ache, muscle joint pain, fever. wished got work day, since get time booster side effects. Instead, fucked Saturday. got situation stupidity, continues. noticed well recent videos keeps stealthily giving credence ridiculous ivermectin nonsense antivaxxers keep peddling.

It’s shame videos used well reasoned based science wasn’t entertaining anti vax nonsense. mean that's basically vaccine keep boosting. Contagiousness =! illness necessarily looked up! Pretty cool! taking exact fruitless actions nothing original strain. make sense? Geez this? new varients poping every months, Delta started Sept months another one Way ignore massive spike Florida barely crawled way of. I've bit lazy scheduling booster think time stop putting off. data weird, ICU protection falls lot protection death remains same. Unfortunately, true, means susceptible infection matter vaccination status, imply they’ll continue effective hospitalization death.  Well fuck.

If it’s less severe, could big trouble “Based current rough estimate transmissibility”

If talking 500x number seen thrown around doubt it’s going hold up. wait see. Blame media. There's good chance strain nothing worried vaccinated, like others. media runs chaos. would vaccine effective something doesn’t exist yet? case different variant. Hopefully won’t know data weeks. time, virus could much less infectious weaker due modification.

It appears majority COVID samples sequenced Guateng, SA last days.

This appear weaker less infectious. opposite. It’s considered “fully vaccinated “ says goal “keep forever”?

You slow spread better understand it’s behavior come targeted vaccine. whatever worth addendum this, main patient issue Hong Kong also asymptomatic throughout whole experience. details find second one passed far, might early say anyway.

 bit frustrating, actually, people read HK-0 ""hospitalized"" result infection, matter preventative policy rather noticeably sick way. Hong Kong's aggressive testing travel quarantine procedures nobody might ever known this, included. migration high, city low birth rate (under 2 since 2005) Ya know, I'm usually much maintaining individual autonomy forcing people situations regarding personal health, point, I'm starting feel like complete vaccine mandate worldwide, coupled strict lockdowns, warranted. I'd prefer live rest life worrying I'll catch deadly illness every time walk front door people can't get heads asses.  Possibility Nu Variant Michigan? ask mean? would affect people's ability live books videogames one way another? wouldnt allow become dominant strain also reduces hospitalization rates compared say delta style strain?

obviously dont actually know anything yet without significantly data points thought Everyone's discussing covid related Black Friday deals. Free vaccines offered across US. Anyone gotten one hurry deal ends!^^/s talking me? adolescent anyone told get booster? What's noble eight fold path? New data looking grim, obviously preliminary People USA largely buying fox news. problem deeper, though; become cultural phenomenon. I'm sure looks beyond absurd outside perspective, I'm really surprised myself, lived USA entire life. easy obvious solution get vaccinated, like country. that's easier said done here.

Fuck fox news republicans this, course, nothing change.

Honest opinion, think new variant probably nothing worry vaccinated - like others. I'm expert, I'm sure, course. you, I'd probably get shots, get booster (if can), stop losing sleep it.

Glad I'm currently USA lmao. Though city left generally pretty good pandemic start finish. unvaccinated. That’s exactly point: slow spread. It’s never goal stop spread it’s impossible. mean work? Stop hospitalizations? Stop spread? Prevent infection? Prevent death? We’re fucked. overreacting saying things like: 

“We back 2020!!”

“There permanent lockdowns, masks, travel restrictions. Better get used it!”

When say untrue things like completely destroy public faith public health. surprise literally nobody...  fucked again. Yea, def help.

Hopefully data soon, really wanna get hit travel ban again.

For families kids 5, many us still live limbo. can't blame them. American hope reasonable response government expectations low. I’m glad hit money, people don’t care die care least. thought. Welp, come new crushing waves death. goal never stop spread. It’s slow spread.  pandemic proved long ago Governments act logic reason basis. Side note FUCK people traveling internationally without protection vaccine? Belgian patient ashamed.

I'm returning normal vaccine, despicable.  I'm sure cost, Pfizer sell steep discount along published schedule price would increase time.

Moderna meant reduced price, sure anything else. First case ***confirmed*** Europe. One still carrier, vaccine protects serious illness. sure mutation respond efficacy vaccine. us still careful wearing masks. Surely could have, spend half time taking care COVID patients half catching postponed surgeries. United States needs mount full, proactive response new variant early quickly. proposed follow steps:

1.	Full 8-week economic social shutdown entire country
2.	Enforce shutdown using National Guard.
3.	Mandate vaccinations 3 month time period face potential prosecution. 4 shots literally nothing compared dying hospitalized.

Tools like meditation, walk nature, listening music help. needs sticky. fact need one good news   Knowing busy hospitals are, 30% reduction hospitalizations would welcome. could happen drug fully available actually taken patients.

Today's dip something freak about, extent indicator variant taken seriously. 2nd time new varient emerges South Africa!! Countermeasures taken long ago!! first case called Omicron Prime Yeah that’s exactly want also farm house middle nowhere…or cryogenically frozen. point things do.  Honestly think half believing conspiracy theories go searching want believe establishment. worse obviously there's variation country lot medical staff burnt dropping industry. Health South Africa: EVIDENCE Nu variant evades current vaccines plethora problems understand. Ingredients, manufacturing, etc. they’ve pursued back timelines over. don’t think they’d vaccines provide approved tomorrow. does, apologize didn’t contextualize information. lot people talked COVID stay, maybe it’s not. is, safely unmask becomes endemic - “a condition present fairly stable, predictable rate among group people - observed number cases approximately number expected.”

Basically, we’re still dealing lot unknowns COVID, surges emerging variants, it’s way known quantity. contrast, diseases like malaria dengue endemic. Lmao Wearing mask normal everywhere. part US would odd one wearing mask. breaking news; 2 planes Holland, came SA, passengers tested could enter country. first 110 tests analysed, 15 positive. seems crazy me...  shit never gon end way freaking freaking out. felt like under-responsive previous variants. sudden we're canceling flights holding planes runways? know don't?

I'm triple vaxed feel unsafe year ago. …Except 4 Botswana Vaxxed What's magic strategy someone needs devise. easy. Yup spike protein way vaccine worked, also head start vaccine. knew studying Sars. 

If engineer new vaccine scratch could take much longer.

Fortunately, really working front scratch, they? That's good guess. Came comment. last greatest role. give Phalanx African Rabies it’ll good. word that's repeat brain day long. That's biology works Yeah story appears vaccinated people getting realizing finding try board planes. Hopefully good sign vaccine effectiveness severe disease. ""Dutch health service says 600 people 2 South African planes, 15 positive COVID-19 95 negative. Nearly 500 results still pending"" Covid 2022: electric boogaloo simultaneously enabling new variants refusal get vaccinated I'm sure know ""whataboutism"" means.

There's nothing ""whataboutism"" comment, see someone else use word wanted use yourself?  15 positive covid cases two flights South Africa Netherlands. Tested upon arrival. Unknown strain yet, 90+% cases South Africa Omicron... listed full lockdown all. US states still mask mandate. going back lockdown US. say 100 percent certainty. also don’t see many lockdowns happening Europe likely since lower risk tolerance admit could well wrong Europe totally. really expert situation there. Yeah, takes 1 family member get infected outside social circle, spreads family friends go spread families.. children go spread schools. *looks Michigan* yeah, hope Omg!! read book years ago forgot title! Really enjoyed it. Time seek again. Thank fellow redditor! natural immunity might anything mutations lead immune detection escape.  good believing special guess? Necronomicron. point testing symptomatic people. test close contact symptomatic people.  already vaccine requirement foreign travelers entering US. began November 8. contain covid without China level lockdowns. see saying now. way originally phrased sounded like saying dominate news *in months now*, dominate news *for months* starting now, that's all. miscommunication. 

I understood way person replying to. thanks didnt even realize 😂 Except people selling masks, Box 50-pack masks Turkey went almost 70% since start gig, U gotta buy mandated got flu shot tho believe FDA require differences. delivery formulation slightly different similar flu vaccines (which different)

Guess find even required. Theodora can't even spell virus.

I'm massively sure that's actual source... Easy/ med/ hard mode though? curiosity, could someone engineer variant deadly overall? Seems like could make one detected longer, spread faster? could make one would kill faster, spread far/fast. wonder could make one spreads long time activates killer-mode, like time-release sleeper cell.

I'm sure nobody capable things would ever this, bad guy anime script writing wants know possible. IIRC hoped Delta going likewise Calm cowboy. Literally one case confirmed. One. Source? Look exponential growth.

There cases suddenly, incredible amount cases.  CDC, course not. live feeds crowded hospitals looping 24/7 people finally realize. Isnt issue solely approval manufacturing scale currently? reasoning people like you. Good luck. Guess want call ""Xi Variant"" piss China eh? ever say comment? first outbreak Covid-19 March 2020, governments criticized closing borders fast enough everytime new scary variant Alpha Delta, governments tried close borders country variant originated from. Meh, buying panic yet. entirely new virus, hardly think it'll render vaccine useless. completely vaccinated wearing mask indoors probably continue enough. Gotta stay sane everyone. going effective Trump's travel ban China. new variant already States, show. holy whataboutism far it’s becoming really like h5n1, transmissible severe, could also mean antibodies previous exposure covid least able react resistive way. least warrant lockdowns vaccine mandates anymore. virus keep mutating like flu, unless working highly exposure lots close contact covid patients environment, probably don’t need anymore boosters either. trade. Things dropping unusually. doubt it’s US. matter time cases identified. 46% ""herd immunity"" original virus Alpha, absolutely wrong. Delta made next wave worse Alpha would been, next wave still inevitable. Ah yes, like miracle, COVID disappear summer. That's ignorant suggest anti-vax movement Africa resulted variant. 

This variant warning world would happen give vaccines poorer countries. 

It's posterchild ""we're together"" conforming standard; usual, typical, expected.

Getting vaccinations boosters perfectly normal (the list vaccines boosters changes). Right now, wearing mask perfectly normal. That’s worst case according him. what’s likely.   50% according CDC even neighbor die covid people still say “I don’t know anyone who’s died!” Simply bc weren’t acquainted neighbor.

But that's literally works.  Ok, cases mild, asymptomatic needed hospitalization? (I forgot serious ones called). think data collection bias statements.

Younger age groups highest rates infection probably easiest detect variants healthiest (and infected population), course infections variant mostly mild.

I would cautious get full picture. 10 Greek letters go.

Though suspect Pi (Yum), Upsilon (Sounds much like Epsilon), Chi (not obvious pronounce) would skipped confuse English speakers. know say, men Persei Omicron seven, women Persei Omicron nine. incivil to, virus? simple risk/reward analysis right now, learned lessons earlier pandemic everyone waited way long implement ""cheap"" solutions.

Travel restrictions politically cheap implement. bureaucratic implementation difficult. costs geopolitical favor restricted nations whatever annoyance domestic population it. pandemic, domestic annoyance travel restrictions going basically zero, southern Africa real geopolitical leverage west: cannot meaningfully retaliate punish UK/EU/US/etc. travel restrictions. super ""cheap"" easy do.

If Omicron ends particularly bad, travel restrictions pay leadership looks good. Omicron ends overwhelmed Delta becomes footnote, restrictions lifted everyone move on. Omicron would bad gets blocked restrictions, political leaders gain ton it. Maybe I’m getting confused Covid plus rewards card spin offs thought season 8  Plague inc again… explain means morons like myself? people get vaccinated small amount vaccinated people die, people anti vax burden healthcare system preventable deaths, poor people 3rd world countries last line get vax, virus mutate said poor countries spread, pharma companies pump another vax, rinse repeat. Look like we're stuck pandemic another year minimum see going away anytime near future, least next 5 years. Yeah, well, I’m old still consider child stuffed fat ugly man’s body. child inside still knows treat folks respect deserve. Could variant saves us all? we're talking days weeks

This pure speculation. Impossible know advance long emerging variant take spread without mitigation measures place. Except saying “governments didn’t act quickly before, time act quickly.” money things relatively quiet holidays. kaboom. #economy  can’t stop spread variant. people think it’s possible? 

No variant evade previous immunity meaningful degree. None have, none will. 

This primarily media hysteria  heard VOHC before, that's thing Delta VOHC? delta kicked ass even vaccines article answer question. specifically dictates end pandemic, therefore masking? would recommend someone technical reading (but still isn’t expert)? Yeah, 114 reporting lag. Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, etc.  South Africa Delta second half October. everything Beta. South Africa unusual original VOC took over, slowing rate takeover contagious VOCs (Alpha, Gamma) Delta showed up.

But certainly ""competing directly Delta"" actively spreading. Let's collectively log leave things people activity collecting analysing data.

I would hope there's UKHSA release today. They've consistently far best research summaries. I've also waiting [Bedford came (but really tell us anything new, estimated ~5 day doubling rate versus Delta). Though started China, Covid came US primarily Europe. shut travel immediately Italy outbreak, let thousands tourists come back home. time China coming hard much threat. Wait said UK Delta time saying didn’t Delta. China’s big lock Russia’s high number. new variant Covid-19 Omicron start Africa, act surface country. going stop playing stupid games. doubt it. Firstly number known cases small. Secondly, number previously known mutations make efficient docking human cells. Obviously, could mutations somehow make virus less effective, that's purely speculative point.  get mutation starts adding body parts? could use eye elbow. American education smh... remember one time US Customs YYZ overwhelmed, causing like 40 passengers barely miss last flight Atlanta day. whole crowd us running gate saw closing doors arrived.

We filed line agent rebooking, kids watched another dad rage agent kids standing next him, visibily cringing. grown ass man losing shit front kids, literally making situation worse nice agent loses patience.

I told kids, ever act like giant raging toddler front please tackle me. I've never embarrassed behalf someone else's kids.  Yeah know. spike mutations concerning potential evade immunity. wanted bring lab tests showing convalescent plasma work spike mutations can't find article discussed it. 

Not like much choice wait see happens.  course isn’t. Next surge starting now. South Africa’s different story, definitely high case numbers/deaths throughout pandemic, African country probably.  Got boosted 2 weeks ago (Pfizer 3) still side effects. bump, gotten better, sore arm new. Anybody else get bad? first 2 weren’t nearly long, tired such. don’t think I’ll see another lockdown here, many crazies think it’s big conspiracy control minds (and maybe is, seem easily controlled). seem enough unvaccinated people dying tie hospital beds thousands enough make society smarter overall.

The one thing think wise shutting flights parts world known. new strain truly awful would slow spread weeks advantage would beneficial long run. guess we’ll lot info week one way ther other. It’s yet government won’t let go back normal. country really 90% vaccinated could drop restrictions masks, go back normal you’d fine. 

Would covid nonexistent? No. Would every ICU empty? No. vast majority folks, you’d completely utterly fine. Yeah see passing unfair massive scale. big chunk population already 6 months past vaccination, meaning would year long period millions people would able travel able get boosters Thank you. God damnit, don’t want another booster 😭 Facepalming US. Hey I’m AZ too! 👋 it’s normal yes. means immune response working. Also could possibly unrelated.  Yep, too. *Narrator: spread.*  panic

In large, friendly letters time addressed this. many friends think 100% immune can’t catch transmit equate term vaccine such. Still take precautions figure thing out, even means slight inconvenience. That’s works  reveal numbers working with? 100k people study, 6 month period, etc.? 2,000 people dying day, think that's endemic? bridge would like sell you. I'm sorry hear that. Frankly international travel restrictions politics public health. pander certain segments population like foreigners whatever reason. hope things improve get visit gramdma :)  Link? Getting sick protect oligarchs' profits lol sure you’re directing frustration solution rather problem  One uncles got 12 years prison. said first 5 years hard got easier. One things easy relatively cheap. isn't.  know mean. It’s incredibly hard, especially can’t see light end tunnel. cliche corny sounds, going together. new variant turns something though, likely modify vaccine get boosters specific variant. Looks like Christmas came early! COVID 4: Infectious Boogaloo dumbest response yet. Oh shit, y'all fun mr toad's wild ride? many new..we need worldwide code place triggers complete Flight banning seconds days till Covid over, ever gets initially source, I've heard numbers around multiple times last couple years. looked found said 2-8 weeks beginning COVID, I'd surprised Delta shortened time death much guess  gonna fucked US least state. work, 30% vaccinated, we’ve lost people, one cares. 770,000 dead covid thus far..,and still vast conspiracy steal rights. thing worse delta brings us back lockdown phase overwhelmed hospitals etc. dont know gonna keep shit together, think country may flip shit. poor doctors nurses, they’ve siege whole time, starting see light end tunnel, lets hope next train. Thank god direct flights SA Canada. want black face Trudeau appear racist blocking fights. Fair. live place probably see code black weeks nobody that's charge actually seems worried enough something it, much panic already I'm like 'no, anóther complication all'.  Yes… haven’t seen grandma 4 years brain bleed weeks ago. restrictions don’t lift soon probably never see again. I'm hoping vaccine required fly Enjoy Thanksgiving, expect month hits everywhere- regardless travel bans. Delta already uncontainable. contagious, much left do. 

Faster, better vaccines answer. medical systems broken monthly. many people died due far? many coming months? actually seem like safe assumption Johannesburg point origin. could still thousand tens thousand total cases worldwide. Travel bans longer works. didnt work before. reason concerned. short term, guess depends type mutations counter them.

In long term, even worrying. signs spike protein changes within couple years virus discovered, imagine ways (within limits ofcause) evolve 4-5 years. fear endemic. probability evolving variants going (vaccinated unvaccinated) populace again. long COVID nothing scoff at. come conclusion mother nature killing us killing her. like ready delta? moronic thing say. reach word limit somehow! sounds like abused fucking bad Till human leaders take seriously know anything point. usual late..just couple countries banned flights South Africa... leaders usual busy pitty stuff.. letting new monster spread Nowhere person say don’t wear mask.

Ok here’s question then. going vaccinate way point restrictions except places hospitals overrun? They’re basically admitting defeat acquire immunity naturally right? winning bigly, much winning, tired winning 😜   I’m vaccinated (booster all) sick hell right it. I’ve got headlines telling got shit horizon? Hard optimistic supposed miracle vaccines. you’re saying “although spreads way more, potential evade immune system (from articles I’ve read), might ‘muscle’ much harm.” 
???  Hesky , ty vole 😜  Njet, yet.  like 100 days testing. I’d love see action comes it. didn’t delta, despite many opportunities, now? Wait mutates food places already experiencing surge. Michigan getting hammered.  Doctors nurses northern Ontario read say 3 days now.

I forgot mention 3 days now. Ive seen speculation people speculate better developed single, immunocompromised, long-covid patient. Makes sense, sudden arrival variety mutations bad take. think people able placed NFL based solely suspicion? That’s happened tons Muslims 9/11.

That’s implication saying due process shouldn’t apply it’s “privilege.”

Something’s status “privilege” mind doesn’t mean isn’t valuable enough merit due process access revoked.

That said, people don’t wear masks harass flight attendants scum hope they’re prosecuted fullest extent law, including barred flights. hate word I'm seeing often. often. UNPRECEDENTED TIMES Sure, updating vaccine small task, real problem distribution.

We're still trying get rich, western countries immunized first time around, we're already seeing new variants might require subsequent immunizations. Even convince holdouts rich countries get vaccine, going many years entire world access, time we're almost certain see new mutations restart entire re-vaccination process.

This second ""major"" mutation we've seen past 6 months might affect vaccinations, global vaccination rollout takes multiple years, expect see multiple major mutations within windows. number deaths lags behind infection numbers infection numbers spiking, stupid people insisted looking hospital bed usage instead decided let numbers rise. Nos sure lot deaths.    Really? ? transmissible less pathenogenic pls  reason believe crap read Facebook etc. without ability think critically logically information presented.  Moderna’s vaccine ready two days. Glad got sorted out, lol. get back 2023, new variant back square one. Fuck 2020s, shit's birds. point isn’t we’re immune though. vaccinated catch covid didn’t get badly ill that’s also good result. concede may catch covid believe I’m vaccinated won’t bad. 

If wanna make case masks fine. wear I’m asked. I’m 3x vaccinated freaking way I’m social distancing again. That’s bs.  variant developed immune compromised patient harbored virus long time, allowing virus replicate replicate certain random changes resulted present form evolved into.

It could happened anywhere world. Or, ya know, instead spreading misinformation reality, could speak truth.

Point things like delays spreading new varient result people vaccinated resistance it, better understanding new varient emerging along potential boosters methods helping combat prevent reduce ultimate amount people get infected die suffer long term consequences.

Or, guess could continue try act like know talking post BS resulted many people taking proper precautions getting sick worse Covid-19. Fucking game ai op. realistic enough  western governments spent first months pandemic saying masks needed leave supplies hospital staff. clearly contradiction. reap sow. discussion time suggested sort ""all above"" - inaccurate reporting suggested also many isolated locations, generally younger population places, etc. complex picture rather straightforward answer suppose. feel like laugh point. absolutely ridiculous. really anything else contribute, pretty much took extract track member team 4-shots.

 People many countries refusing first shot vaccine, going take second third fourth dose.  Sorry break you, rich already get partake air travel. poor world, large majority never know luxury. Ironically bet they’d wear masks prevent getting contagious vaccine I’m point feel numb all. Something new, something different, something unheard/unseen arises week. Every human making trillions mRNAs every second (duh)  see. think different meanings word “end”. me, last summer “end”. Cases low, deaths tapering off, vaccination rates climbing.

There's little evidence beyond theoretical point variant. Something like Lambda contagious yet managed die out. I'd need see evidence one make judgements means vaccine rollout.

Sounds bad mutations. IDK makes think around somewhere undetected mutated much?

Hope turns nothing. answer never. either always restrictions accept covid new norm single anecdote random redditor's friend vs studies showing vaccines 70-90% effective infection Delta, Moderna's study showing original vaccine effective booster compared Delta-specific booster. That's downvoted. people still realize anecdotes nearly worthless? 1. deadliness delta compared OG strain often overstated. deadly, yes, scheme things, much.

2. Delta came around, virus LOT room mutate. Now, not. We've seen Lambda, Mu Delta Plus become largely non-issues volatile compared Delta.

We know happen again, unlikely, would take true freak-of-nature variant. 54.4% vaccination rate. *sigh* American quickly come realize worst possible way get people something say it’s safety people know problem evil ghouls earth tricking others conspiracy theory vaccines bad making matter realize there's hell lot international travel rich people vacationing around, right?!

Edit: lawyer follows account funnily enough. Furry community small person well known? question whether Pfizer drug treatment Covid, already catch it, work variant. looking like virus going keep mutating evade vaccines- may treatment hope. Ah yes must that, even though evidence of:


-it’s transmissibility

-it’s mortality

-It’s vaccine escape capability 

-if even exists anywhere else right now

You’re talking ass 

People said shit P1, lambda, mu variants… ""horse dewormer""  horse deowomer got booster recently. really never going end, it? Totally agree. Might good time update vaccines soon. Since spike mutation. 

Does look good though. Best case contagious way less deadly. 

The timeframe roll new vaccines matter short still enough kill many. Sorry no, it’s kind crazy. ramp here. It’s pandemic mode forever Also - whether want take seriously not, study she’s referencing bloom labs. suppose also want discredit them? Still recovering booster side effects. SIGH. infecting hundreds thousands, millions people every day. many useful safe medications harm self administer random doses.  That's I'm trying explain you. ""horse version"".

The pills meant horses come horse version-size.

So people able slice pill weigh ative ingredient take dose need would fine. gobble pill get dose meant horse, much human. Good point used go bed high wired… carrot suffocating death surrounded strangers. Wtf hope variant doesn’t spread Looking forward 2020 2: Holy fucking shit boogalo  seems fucked fr People taking pills meant animal size horse. they're eating way much. Delta contagious deadly original strain. know happen again? think referring Trump March 2020 saying would gone Easter.   saying... want credibility make proper profile lol.

Not trying bash but... link Twitter account says end world credibility account face. [Yes, looks like that's they're HK Also, [it's worth reading Twitter Oh no, wacky name.. 🙄  one South African province, dominant strain. need evidence suggest outcompete delta widely.

And again, even end objectively outcompeting delta, indication deadliness.

And even end deadlier infectious (somehow), modify vaccines suit new threat. Hell yeah open airports. Probably, us. That's definitely encouraging news I've read today.  Sounds like likely happen actually. Yes early tell. guys… mean, yes, getting vaccinated important, point going start talking figuring therapies effectively treating deadliest symptoms COVID? It’s endemic now, mutations going keep coming. It’s endless game whack-a-mole we’re eventually going lose.

UGH. gripe anyone patient enough listen. resources could put towards improving filtration/ventilation spent performative disinfection surfaces. It’s like collective knowledge COVID transmission hasn’t updated since March 2020. new guy, whoever might be, would inevitably polarizing. measures required control pandemic reduce spread always going massively unpopular population. Masks never going popular measure. Lockdowns never going popular measure. School closures never going popular measure.

Replace Fauci literally person measures would unpopular, moreso.  already competing Delta, that's issue. sickening annoying. I'm tired going again. feels like never going end variant invades vaccine good night. Governments handle pandemic beyond poorly. watch spread Christmas. One scientists worked Moderna vaccine

The data bloom labs study molecular evolution proteins viruses worries. - could big deal, even somehow end infectious + deadly + vaccine evasive (a.k.a. absolute worst case scenario), face way Delta. Modify vaccines, get distributed, vaccinate poorer countries we're it. members family health issues would put risk.  Twitter anyone take seriously?

Honest question. 

I find tweet says... Well, anything. I'm beyond caring others want think. workplace free all. reminding mask mandates law. I'm targeted workplace rat, believe it? Grown men leaving hand drawn pictures rat show fellow employee pissed mask. Like wtf...it's pandemic I'm telling sneaking smoke bro. wanna die this. Good thing overdone sequels suck.  seems case random flare seems excessive even accounting factors ‘new variant’ seems thing suspect. alpha delta followed pattern. Huge spike, days later, new variant. I’d surprised Germany didn’t decent surveillance apparently UK South Africa particularly good.

And yes hope bring new name soon. Naming place first detected seems bring racists unfortunately mean offends anyway. Sorry caused hard feelings. astrazeneca news vaccine efficacy. really causing hopelessness left fridge open? comforting. Thank you. always variants won’t fully effective vaccine. chance boosters enough. time testing approval, totally different variant concern. Iirc cochise pretty well compared rest AZ awhile, maybe lot uninfected go through.

Lacking proper theater, however, get sued! icu nurse cannot go surges. damn near close wanting leave nursing never returning. remember people laughing delta “Indian variant” known time first discovered. “A double mutation? They’re trying scare us!” 

I’m chicken little whenever anything pops UK already travel ban they’ve little restrictions makes nervous  Ugh. 😒 hate get downvoted, that's fair. answer question, yes concern well founded, no, case. reduction reproduction transmission greater increases risk escape mutant. Case point, serious mutations come countries letting virus run rampant, high vaccinated countries. Didnt wear masks needed social distancing. Huh? P.1 indeed dangerous, responsible deaths South America. Company performative bs clearly means science bs. Man I’m tired this. Really hope variant nothing Delta reigns supreme cause can’t deal another variant changing game like Delta did.  used worried every last variant got reported on. reading, quite literally 100's articles past six months saying ""all need get vaccine"", realized wrong stupid believing hype stopped worrying it. everyone get vaccine, start living normally again. sincerely thought IP *was* public, [I article talk vaccinated? Everyone's healthy Two people Hong Kong doubled vaxxed caught it. returned flight SA would safe assume travelers caught well? Well - there's lot hookworm going around South. Pharmas aren’t them, simply isn’t gonna work. time new vaccine becomes available market lengthy process new variants emerged.

Moderna BioNTech developed original vaccine less month, really think aren’t able same? flight Thailand, delayed hour people got kicked plane find luggage cargo hold give back them... deffo think pay return shipping delayed hundred people. Fuck guys.  Delta escapes immune system speed reproduction, vaccine lost significant effectiveness. delta specific vaccine would 10% better, that, issues waning immunity applies natural vaccinated immunity, nothing new, nothing unique delta. justification get new vaccine, bottle necks associated new vaccine roll out.  Nu Coke

Also think q people would field day nu/new corona  Indeed, it’s actually virus’ benefit super deadly. Natural selection favour virus doesn’t kill host immediately, allows survive, get spread it. says credibility Africa's health minister announced Thursday discovery new coronavirus variant appears spreading rapidly parts looked like cluster outbreaks, yesterday, indication came scientists Network Genomic Surveillance observing new variant,"" Minister Health Joe Phaahla said, stressing currently unclear variant -- currently dubbed B.1.1.529 -- first far detected South Africa, Botswana traveler Hong Kong South Africa, Phaahla added. Good news healthy individuals stand increased chance living.  country crisis 20% adults refuse get vaccinated. thing happened Singapore (with vaccinations 85% total population, 94% eligible). big spike lasted 2 months, coming sharply people getting onboard booster programme.

The biggest crunch us hospital load - unvaccinated people vaccinated elderly health problems filling critical care wards.

we learnt \~10% population getting infected necessary condition ""living covid"". Restrictions starting ease now. 

Hang Portugal! Yep, horrifying. comes nursing , voters devoid intelligence they'll vote safe-staffing nurse-patient ratios they're ""government mandated"". Asking average american think beyond visceral, trained reaction phrase ""government mandated"" asking damn much apparently. 

What's alternative government mandate? corporate mandate, vast , vast majority country lives under. Wage slaves afraid laws protect them. 10% population unvaccinated 30% hospitalizations unvaccinated, means 3x likely hospitalized you’re unvaccinated. thought already Nu variant? Got balance. Get shots, wear mask keep distance. much else realistically do. happened air marshalls? longer thing? do, mutate different rates. need new flu vaccine every year this. use existing technology identify element year’s common strain incorporate vaccine. one 4 months another 6. It’s pointless, right?

Variants keep coming up, design vaccine specifically one variant, time becomes widely available market long series procedures including Development, Trial, Approval, Production, distribution… etc…

New variant already emerged.

No one wants hear this, reached point treat virus like flu, matter vaccine works not. I've many things thrown working hospital years, many times people totally alert coherent.

It's serious issue I'm glad airlines getting exposure wish Healthcare workers received level attention regarding workplace violence face. variants mutated though? reason it’s super variant per se super high amount mutations, varies strains strongly Yep, [this illustrates much clearly one that's getting posted here. still almost 2 million adults per week getting first dose. It’s consistent months. Slow, adds quite lot people several months. Well America massive head start. don’t know current stats are, two apples apples you’re comparing stats whole pandemic. There’s also fact wasn’t long Delta outbreaks began vaccine efforts started ramping up. strain contagious Delta evades vaccine immunity they’d probably need lock again, they’ve also implemented strictly many countries, seems citizens getting less tolerant lockdowns. rate, didn’t say measures failure, saying worked well strain showed contagious methods they’d using. I've 4 myself. original 2, ""off-the-books"" booster, got official booster couple weeks ago. feel pretty well protected. Ebolavid2021 … fuck  Weird things change. variant literally identified days ago. see account literally time ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  self lockdown. Looks like people care. therefore good news individuals 'new mutation' really entail? infectious would mean easier spread still equally potent (if that's right word haha) strain would be? Every time someone gets infected raises risk new deadlier variant.

Wearing masks, social distancing, quarantining ways reduce number people get it.

Face facts. rebel whining.  do, much, much slower. look experts saying try understand rather burying head sand.  Agreed. Sorry. poor job explaining logic. shared Vietnam post also sounded scary turned ok. I’m naïvely hoping thing. except one looks like is. Yay spreads easily delta (possibly much quickly), already everywhere. 

We'll see shortly well actually competes delta immunity/vaccines. 

Scary, sadly wait see. cases Australia creeping due opening borders mostly released internal restrictions Yet many believe global warming. Go figure. Ah yes major news outlet depend fear get clicks factual... Nope. Last week ""Scientists mystified, wary, Africa avoids COVID disaster"".  mean displace variant 90 +% dominant globally tall order.. Thanks this. thought heard distorted takes subject refreshing hear new inanity. NZ passes 6 month expiry. Got 3rd shot today pass expires May 22. Could rise testing outbreak spread makes looks worse relative previous low testing?  ...again...again International flights continue largely unchecked Australia's response covid death rate 29 per million people hardly failure. one hundredth death rate average US state. think say worked 100 times better. I'm much line reasoning. still triage. Based statistics true. one provide stats can't find  Yeh still sharp upwards trend despite error  think problem argument could apply everything. flu? sky diving? going outside?

Everything risk, vaccines keep people hospital cases matter.

And vaccines keep people hospital get them?

And lastly unvaccinated causing issue apply restrictions them. think sensible learn potential risks.

 Boris came lot criticism didnt bans India ages Delta variant obviously going crazy hit earlier Delta countries it. Hopefully he's actually learnt lesson here. think that's people expect. lockdown forever   can't vaccinate everybody anyway

Tell smallpox.  live Europe. :O

But sites shared around world typically slow news day US. Lots people escape phones disconnect awkward family gatherings Thanksgiving, story cleaning advertising.  Vaccinating world would mean putting many barriers viral spread possible. greatly increase chance virus dying quick death enters human body. not, giving open path reach us. stuck like years rate… Although agree, end matter. can't vaccinate everybody anyway. places vaccines ppl ppl refusing it, places would benefit vaccines personnel capacity distribute everywhere, and, again, ppl declining too. call new variant potentially ""immunity evading"" - mean better evade immunity past strain infections vaccines, something 'inherent' strain would make likely evade future variant-specific immunity? (Hope question makes sense) Except toxic liver organs extended use. supposed 2 doses week apart worms, fucksticks taking every day. even care anymore point 🤷🏾‍♂️ possible? Yeah. mostly shifted stuff like ""if classic vaccine used"". standard old vaccines way could within months. could get lot people vaccinate, common argument RNA vaccines new kind vaccine mention last time Delta stop travel negotiating trade deal India. Whereas priority countries Southern Africa, pretty much reason Johnson gov pop red list. anything helps deflect last 2-3 bad weeks they've press wise Drawing gives us time fight keeps spaces open people need hospitals everyday stuff like heart attacks, lost fingers turkey lawn mower accidents true. got shot made instantly happy. Holy shit true. like everything read real. fear even mentioned???? might naturally susceptible virus  fear all, getting used Delta.

Kinda surprised tbh. I'm beyond tired point. nothing left feel anymore.  Plus, different pathogens different mutation rates due biology. might we've finally caught onto island stuff like this. They're also trying desperately 'save Christmas' new infection would mean lockdowns shouting.  scared child getting covid, vaccination really prevent transmission know retires wants volunteer. try see get take crochet something.   would set us back years?   would paywall story??? scientific report. This. hospital close full even full, adds strain everything else requires attention. he's going business trip next week hes got backhanders lose time. Completely worthless? Unlikely. likely dent efficacy degree though.

So far we've seen protection infection drop new variants protection severe disease remains fairly high. could different time honestly know anything yet. Severe COVID widely recognized activation bodies immune system, suppression it.

I idea got idea virus functions disabling immune system. way asserting vaccinated people experiencing breakthroughs. Like all. That's actually part point. necessarily. It’s automatically terrible it’s heavily mutated.   worms Covid Ikr? I'm terrible person! 😂 Absolutely, Going purely hospitalizations age, true around world. true way important booster 60 year olds get 18 vaccinated.   AFAIK, using RNA technology new vaccine could put together matter weeks. don’t know tests would take long last time it’s like vaccines notion become useless. might need another round new shots. sucks still. Wow. Thats less entire county often has. County, country. even state. Good job Canada. Hopefully learning mistakes...

This entire pandemic ""It might bad, might be. We'll wait gets bad take action."" bad, costly decision every time. 

Better weeks re-assess know going on. Yeah, dumb. People fully vaccinated take extra precautions protect people who've willfully decided get vaccinated. I’m sure believe see it. think they’ve oversold ability update speed. gonna keep happening rich countries gonna hog vaccines. I've explained million times. know I'm again. Well luckily rule law rule man.

I agree swift harsh punishment, agree disregarding presumption innocence slippery slope fuck us all

Do really see nothing wrong “throw em jail first let lawyers figure they’re jail already serving time”, all? Like nothing wrong eyes?  One example, millions people doubled vaxxed, evidence. growing trend double vaxxed younger people dying may be. always outliers. It’s downvoted seems imply vaccines aren’t working. It’s like thread driving safety someone says, “well know guy survived wasn’t wearing seatbelt.” would prove wrong try source claims. got booster shot Pfizer Tuesday night, protection yet Thursday night? Where's data? estimate R value? Better safe sorry anti-vaxxxers, yes do. deserve semblance respect. putting lives everyone else plane risk. absolutely deserve swift harsh punishment.   It’s gift keeps giving suppose say ‘British’ rather UK. know country they’re in? Funnily enough, don’t celebrate thanksgiving UK. rest world matter. agree also insanity expect unvaccinated people continue distance live normal life. Glad we're page. thing. We've ever achieved herd immunity via vaccines.  flu changes 2 % genome every year. mutate lot. Flu shots vaccines big brains think active year. got wrong. There's 13 2 Delta know it’s anecdotal know least 4 people caught twice already, keep hearing cases acquaintances too. Doesn’t seem rare Delta. Okay well that's misinformation fro one Google papers come Hey might infected already even know it. Image much completely unverifiable posts manner lunatics attention seekers would limited. may sincere hell's teeth there's thousand users who'd making things interesting tales utter nonsense.  This. get people say variant emerges *will* cause another wave, rather saying *could*. Like people willingfully accept catastrophe unavoidable. mentality bollocks.

What countries ban flights whenever cases spiking certain territory, instead waiting scientists say new variant emerged already late. Quarantining people countries cut anymore, small chance virus propagates regardless. need temporarily banned flare calms up. point recent history emergency care rationed.   article expresses frustration long COVID take little exception shade throws medical workers. see patients long COVID, CFS, similar chronic diseases time frustration real. medical professionals answers them. medications take. tests orders. patients tend desperate answers, any. patients exhausting deal zillion complaints,, none help.. feel written ""crazy,"" medical treatments people. Seeing counselor getting support group frankly best do. gun see 50 patients maybe help.

Well written article kinda hit piece. reading something said South African delaying deliveries due sufficient supply uptake. Stupidity worldwide problem apparently.  Hahaha like one. Except medium age south africa around 27, yeah 34.. public transport.   Brit - two possibilities

1. genuinely something worried about.

2. prime minister currently deep shit number reasons (most unrelated covid), added bonus variant bring one effective thing come time PM (the vaccines) may thing forces job - hence he's taking chances Ooooorrr. could exact thing taxes, like rest world. Well western countries anyway. know speak *hehe*
You frekkin scared taxes rather die. Hello amazing folks,

My 10 year old due second Pfizer vaccine shot, debating reasonable 6 hours getting airplane.

1) increased risk infection immediately shot? don’t believe is, asking.

2) interaction shot Dramamine?

Thanks!  don’t know yet…. Damaging society economy little gain public health. need shut up. Seriously, bold claims like makes harm good. I’m extremely huge pro-vac, even enrolled inactive vaccine trials 2020 november(Sinovac) got 2 doses Pfizer. Next month I’m going get Pfizer booster going 5th Covid vaccine year. kind statements creates problematic opinions fuels anti-vaxxers. said “Get vaccine last line defense. become careless vaccinated. future may need get boosters virus evolving” etc… worth hundreds thousands dead trillions debt. way worth 5 million lives (more like 20 India China counted) Might. Maybe. Perhaps. 

What pile crap. even viable plan, species can't sing tune save working together. right, irks see many people small minded knee jerk reaction ""just shut international travel"" without ever considering consequences firmly pandemic phase, evidenced infection levels peaking currently. 
 idea precautionary principle relates changes status quo, continuance 
 
You mistaken. misleading. 
The status quo pre-pandemic situation. 
 saying closing borders would postpone spread weeks. 
 
I saying enforced border quarantines enable flatten wave considerably. need wait arrival spring summer. 
 words would ineffectual COVID border shutdowns attempted... 
 
Wrong again. 
Enforced border quarantines success last 5000 years. 
 way reduced amount population ultimately infected 
 
You wrong, again, affects average infections together reinfections. You’re posting nonsense every story now. stop. Well played. missed connection cus forgot fill blue toilet liquid. Thats annoying fine. 
 
What really annoying kept lying trying fuck over. Saying things like fault, weather delay...when know fucking toilets cus come plane told us thank immediate mass vaccinations said mutations. Accuracy issue. 20 upvotes post without source is. Well, several hundred others like (94%) scrape found minutes.

I found smattering subs seem focus science. I'll give shot.

Thanks assistance, though. Yea yea calling international travellers terrorists, affect right? disgusting. Many people travel essential reasons world able function without international travel. need ban international travel, need better local measures vaccination, importantly, world work together. That's case US, necessarily elsewhere. Europe liberals who're anti-mask anti-vax they're supposedly concerned ""freedom"". nothing political parties weirdly many Americans (at least live Paris) vote democrats think covid flu. think much less politics social cultural interactions. mean, first reported genomes tuesday, reported local authority thursday, named greek name friday. Liver damage might take time diagnosed, probably overlooked patient dies covid. Marty: “Hey I’ve seen one before.” go again. case counts rapidly go hospitals get overwhelmed...bad shit happens governments competent would supply masks case airborn pandemic. early pandemic government found supply masks. admit incompetent instead said masks don’t work. since many unwilling admit wrong. Great, countries follow suit. This!!!! hard??? Would great “regular” illnesses well.   ...again  they’ll continue spreading forever father ongoing Pfizer-BioNtech Delta booster phase 3 trial. 6 months since Delta became variant concern, booster approved another 2 3 months, minimum.

They could designing mRNA vaccine targeting B.1.1.529 evening, vaccine/booster targeting likely get emergency use authorizations next August.  Merry Christmas everyone don’t think counterproductive means think means. Beta horrendous, virulent Delta Delta wiped out. people 
Started spreading knowing was… get needs reported scientific community consult, good god, let's wait hear real data variant freaking out. understand get blood sera confirmed individual carrying variant actually challenge BSL3/4 get real results without modeling pseudo type? get expensive, damn would much faster. Beta real fear monger paper turned nothing....  point there. Theres data suggest outcompeting. dominant one region enough delta draw conclusion  agree saying, quite politicians benefiting situation major cities (Cuomo example). live Philadelphia mayor trying hard keep NYC, kind pathetic. several times pandemic restrictions tightened reason NYC it. country huge largely segregated politically. news liked cover people south going crazy, heavily liberal areas restrictions gave political points local politicians.   Well accept depress people even locking   friend mine

As evidence bold claim, equals downvote.  Supernatural zombies really grind gears. biological functions compelled eat? muscles even moving?   That’s fair. read somewhere higher viral load correlated higher infection rate, time ago understanding virus evolved greatly. already targets unprotected populations though? makes feel ok thank needed  Jesus makes mad.   Better monoclonals price what? Like $1700 +? appears takes boosters 7 days kick in. That’s much, much faster first two doses though. Oh I'm giving them. get 70% invest good HEPA purifier households, urge businesses, restaurants, theaters, hotels, offices, schools, etc upgrade air filtration, future would brighter. honestly people even invest. People broke. make shot free, make air purifier free.

 lot people trust science realize well filters remove coronavirus air. messaging there. Unless adopt China's strategy, may work, still get leaks pretty frequently  I'm pleased rapidly done. Gives hope contained. personal fear virus adapt target unprotected populations. elderly adults mostly vaccinated, leaves children largest population available new variant target.

But I'm virologist understand what's gone mind. don’t believe COVID endemic point?

The idea precautionary principle relates changes status quo, continuance (i.e. leaving borders are).

What saying closing borders would postpone spread weeks. words would ineffectual COVID border shutdowns attempted, way reduced amount population ultimately infected. third country. look phylogenetic tree covid, delta pushed pretty much variants real quick. Unfortunately govt actually clue do. sweet good money leave experts behind. Thats incentive becoming politician.  Also, cause disruption? ^ Maybe little bit? disruption it'll cause much greater benefits provides. 

I'm pretty sure people calling travel bans live ""big"" countries international travel affect all. People live smaller countries Europe appreciate importance international travel much people. Ok, tell ends leaking one's country spite bans? Where's logic behind that? There's gotta mechanism new variant enters territory, people mechanism. Both. depends Africa. pandemic pathway linear pre-determined. Drug treating X helps people X even also unrelated condition  modern politics modern media, divide two always severe enough warrant hospitalisation vulnerable. rocket science, virulent delta vaccine evasive, soon (if) thing takes hold we're looking full ICUs within matter days, rather couple weeks. takes 0.1% sick rapidly that. Um yeah, did. personally know two people got single dose J&amp;J vaccine, gotten covid winter 2021, got Delta summer. get experience anecdotal, pretend like people gotten infected twice absurd. Vaccine immunity stronger natural immunity. That's data shown us far. Imagine everyone gotten one virus hadn’t mutated couldn’t reproduce. 🤭😡 woah! Wow! Virus gone!! get you. Even less severe, transmissable total number people infected significantly higher compressed time frame total hospitalisation go roof

You'd rather severe virus less transmissable eg ebola Doesn’t buy time? Ah, mistake. thought replying Worth-Enthusiasm. Pavel_Baidurov clearly determined great idea, he’s spamming everywhere. Eh, probably true. Large parts world either under-reporting stopped counting altogether. But, but.. would sensational! smh Gotta careful CT values assuming someone infectious vaccination testing positive via PCR. I'm saying contagious means. PCR detect CT values indicating viral load cannot discern whether viral RNA actually infectious virions. lockdown means. least, nothing like previous ones.

There'll 1 (one!) week January people working home, schools closed, well bars discos, order prevent people moving around much right Christmas New Year's festivities.

Other that, mostly bringing back masks indoors vaccine certificates December. requiring negative tests enter places higher risk, like hospitals, nursing homes, events crowds bars discotheques. 

Which fairly reasonable. Winter. Shit's hit fan. Better safe sorry. work. virus find way leak country. Banning international travel causes disruption helps. extremely pissed 30 people actually upvoted comment.   Bye bye ""Called."" parts country got crushed (NY/NJ first coke mind) parts essentially didn’t get touched. Makes sense 2021 worse terms full country Ok Pfizer, good time reformulate vaccine. think honest. full old blood. People need replaced young efficient mindsets. simply slow, slow. feel comment whole soul.. it’s like we’re wasting life away people carelessly don’t give f easily , can’t put life hold anymore 😔 So, guess Road Rules: Botswana going pushed next year, now. Probably butbits pretty far second far weighs story history tell ourselves. Wars obviously dramatic human psyche pandemics . Case point Spanish flu WW1 Heck yeah :) Cdc issue one famous ""there proof (the new variant bad)"", wait 3 months things get bad issue rushed press release emergency measures way late Agree lesson rn lmao wrote fast, update 5 minutes  ""It may"" enough data say much anything yet. What's scary quickly variant took over. went 0-80% cases less quarter time took delta to. Man, really need learn use paragraphs.

You got good info here, majority people read fucking walls text XD Great Britain Scotland, England Wales. UK United Kingdom Great Britain Northern Ireland. None countries detected Nu inside borders. said Friday (Nov 26) travellers recent travel history Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa Zimbabwe 11.59pm Saturday longer allowed enter transit Singapore. feel like moron

why?  Would kindly explain last sentence layman’s verbiage. Thanks people secretly hope world's next major variant?

So far got guy delta+ 😕🤷 Good! Fucking around plane acceptable. So, countries closing borders reason? seems dramatic pretty daring step economically. UK Israel wealthy countries highly educated teams medical professionals scientists inform thier political leaders. add me. Reading Bloom Labs tweet thread, gist they're saying seems Nu might evade type antibody produced vaccines, mean would evade layers immune system (like t-cells) produced vaccine response. basically, variants, one ""most"" escape seen far, mean actually escapes. might first one make across pit fire, still ends dying spike trap. state WI whole 4000 cases day hasn’t announcement new variant samples collected people. longer naive regards immunity protection

Excuse sir, heard Texas?   people deliberately obtuse here? identified 48hrs ago. labs testing circulating number days. would ot outperforming delta anything yet? Obviously meant longer term. racist? /S virus mutates?

There already new variant spreading It’s less leaders average citizen importantly, might lose election Brah, I'm gonna need sick days boosters XD

I 3rd shot couple days ago worst body aches 101 - 102 fever 36 hours LOL Who's we? Narrator: “But nobody listened” Well, everyone already vaccinated, may ended mutation first place might closer containment/eradication.

Instead may going back square 1 2. That's dumb thing--by US data enough satiate them, it'll late. Can't that, would inhibit profits. Somewhere. capacity. Lol shit never end Oh come fuck on. want damn pandemic constantly worry loved ones every time leave house. point ? 🎶Here go own

Go road we've ever known🎶 27600 cases per day per capita?!?!? remain highly effective preventing hospitalizations deaths, wanes effectiveness mild moderate cases. nobody knows well current vaccines work new variant. point variants stop variants start SARS-CoV-3?  course have. several endemic coronaviruses covid   Days. take days.  Who? Yeah... everyone world lol. many major variants evolved USA? Holy crud, did: well, well. 90s, South Africa’s government officially denied link HIV AIDS, refused free antiretroviral drugs Germany. People afraid drugs plot make sterile, imagine similar attitudes vaccines. long time, need write. normally deleted writings sub continue university party spending time gf.Then got cheated,my country's economy got fucked variant came lol.I aware mutations bad immune escape. First god, really optimistic person variant ""doomsday variant"". Normally 2 escape mutations popular variants like mu,beta,lambda,kappa. B.1640 emerged made little bit worried 3 like(F490,Y449,R346) still sure vaccines work.Then shit came. First waiting max 3 escape mutations checked mutations list 6 escape mutations. numbers mutations look scary. know E484, worst overall one worst mutation class 2 antibodies. K417 worst class1 unfortunetaly G446 top 3 worst mutation class 3 antibodies. Probably worst combo get virus plus N440 biggest escape rate monoclonal antibody(C135) Q493 also shows big escape rate (C121 C144). Eli lilly antibodies cocktails trouble E484,Q493 K417. Regen cov cocktails also took hit mostly G446 N440 E484 Q493. sum up, worst variant far without doubt. monoclonal antibody treatments work work less effective. vaccines, best scenario combinations work together probably opinion,we may need update vaccines first time variant become dominant, hope wrong one can't compete delta.  Considering deelta one ""nu"" occuring time different spike proteins least protection Delta next bunch months. 

We already others pop displace Delta leader, one might same. 

The reporting one feels different though. case, vaccines specific Delta? around lot longer 90 days. Ah, see, climate change potential kill every single human being, long run problem definitely solve itself. Hopefully! indoor Thanksgiving everyone boosted. unfortunately, seem like mu variant. reactions alone understand that.  Smart move now, things figured out. Usually end agree combination thing low vaccinations HIV. Mutations emerge virus replicate human body. immune system doesnt work well,you can't stop virus replication. Unfortunetaly SA popular high HIV cases. Look Beta,C1.2 variant came SA always produce escape variants.  Ha early 2020 living Colorado, started hearing virus read lot foreign politics. hearing bad (it hard find) told people get serious ignored. Within weeks Colorado like second hotspot country one point county highest death rate country.

And got covid coworker believed fake news. frustrating 🙃 U.S. government fund companies’ research development Pfizer vaccine all. 

Moderna J&amp;J benefited government investment development research.  Yall need fucken get vaccinated That’s true, Portugal still top 98% uptake among adults  Chardee macdenis 19  They'd putting different vaccines vials, no? happens used ones? old shit again. Moderna Beta Delta variant vaccines Phase III testing right now. Also, remember Covid-19 sequenced China March 21, 2020, Pfizer Moderna vaccines invented March 30, 2020. went testing months production facilities built gov’t “warp speed” money. time already facilities make vaccines, would test new boosters.

If variant able evade vaccines, definitely boosters stop it, like said. rushed book vaccination appointments France Thursday government announced adults eligible booster shot health passes would longer valid certain period failed get health minister, Olivier Véran, said news conference Thursday France experiencing new wave cases would “stronger longer” one summer, “no lockdown, curfew, store closures, travel restrictions” would focusing vaccinations social distancing measures, said, “we making choice reconcile freedom weekend, anyone age 18 able get booster shot, beginning five months second injection earliest, Mr. Véran said.

Aurelien Breeden covered France Paris bureau since 2014. reported worst terrorist attacks hit country, dismantling migrant camp Calais France's tumultuous 2017 presidential election. @aurelienbrd Supply chains vaccines already spun continues expand. Pfizer making plans eventuality needing roll updated vaccine back Delta first appeared. mRNA vaccines easy update precisely makes amazing relative earlier vaccine technologies.

Basically, trail that's already blazed one vaccine companies already prepping run again. There's probably someone office Pfizer right that's started creating updated payload new vaccine. turns one significantly evades existing vaccines, get expedited put trials soon. watch, next week it'll United States. watch, next week it'll United States. I've also heard started Botswana. SA lot sequencing, likely plays role. low?  educated myself. zero.  South African , test pretty regularly testing centres throughout country. According doctor friends good job mitigating it. really can’t go anywhere without mask hand sanitized. say public lost interest past months lax protection, wear masks sanitize hands public places force , I’m pretty sure personal gatherings none happens. source? miss article? almost like South Africa really good detecting new variants  28% South Africa first vaccine dose. 5% tested positive (though 2% CFR testing much countries; still most). imagine point run issues material supply create vaccines quickly. Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax, J&amp;J year collect supplies create vaccines, doubt that's something keep hand enormous values.

Unfortunately, not, yet. still much epidemic.

Endemic mean people tired following restrictions; means reproduction number around 1, without restrictions (like seasonal influenza). order reach level, need way higher levels herd immunity. means vaccinations, want them, natural infections. quickly hospitals can't handle volume patients anymore. means - unless vaccination rates going go significantly - still take quite while. time Christmas lol Wait Flu H5N6 DLC come 10 years. It’s never done. Masks impede freedom, obviously.

Alpha 50% delta 100% deadly original variants.  got Pfizer booster Monday, worst side effects I've arm soreness tingling Honestly don’t see cases low long sudden happens long elections, wouldn’t surprised number manipulated passed weeks. variant mutated country barely covid infections lmao Sure, nonetheless, variant potentially outcompete delta concerning.   too, don’t really choice 😔. chronically ill covid means you’ll even less time/energy/money deal things shit. That’s I’m thinking anyway.  HK cases double vaccinated. Melbourne’s big half big numbers they’re putting there. 

They’re vocal, insignificant minority. Fuck ‘em. Nearly named variants spread worldwide, it’s clear yet compete Delta Variant.

Looks like it’s going get name likely, might fizzle out. There’s guarantee it’s big one.  think worth noting especially UK tried pin Alpha variant us well beginning. Alot strains necessarily developed test shit Covid much higher rate countries much likely find new ones.

In reality variant probably already elsewhere first ones find it. wife arrived back UK South Africa Wednesday morning. Absolutely full plane. cabin crew repeatedly announce passengers needed wear masks instructions widely ignored. 

So yes, probably late.  many questions:

Missing every report far sick symptomatic people are. guys wearing masks *before* covid too. Yep seems like many people know worse side effects boost original shots. imo makes sense. also isn’t fun. Worth it, fun.  I'm saying would I'm selfish prick. reality could fly Netherlands South African use EU passport get around.

Or could get expatriated. ways around still rich definitely so. lockdown get rid current cases covid decides eat another [super gain another 50 mutation. new variant, expected designated ‘Nu’, found 32 spike protein mutations, compared 13 17 seen Delta variant

too alarmist headline Thing is, countries close boarders Sth Africa keep boarders open countries closed boarders South Africa, wouldn’t redundant still cause spread? countries would need close boarders Sth Africa surely. I’m sick world reactive instead proactive Governments ignore scientists thinking leave last minute late 6 months another lockdown wondering close air travel. Yay   normal panic, extremely concerning. would good countries act sooner rather later safe rather sorry. Cannot imagine pain grief could cause. normal worried panic.

See, mistake: forgot Trump 90% full shit yes health system collapses, ? let old people die streets ? 

mandatory vaccination better option Get grip.

Sorry sounding harsh, seriously…. access vaccine. Quit whinging.  saying.. without antagonistic intention, many countries Africa able acquire distribute vaccine people would grateful eager get it. 

I agree unvaccinated breeding grounds lethal mutations.. saying everyone isn’t vaccinated isn’t willingly so. Shout Sth African variants ramping winter👊🏼 add response, can't ""just"" hire nurse doctors, take years make we're kinda stuck anyway finish studies  Let virus infect everyone, kill many life like before.

I saying, good alternative.   first found Botswana German health minister made comment thinks end winter people either vaccinated, recovered dead. Maybe bit dramatic point. media briefing Prof de Oliveira said 50 mutations  
overall 30 spike protein, target  
most vaccines key virus uses unlock doorway  
body's cells. ...and adapt vaccines (if necessary).  Oh man.. Calm down. idea changes mean virus. many mutations one time. well could still match delta gets left dust. Also, idea might unrecognizable immune system mere speculation point. Again, many changes spike know sure. commentary based mutations recognized, mutations could potentially hinder new version well beyond advantages gained leave same. know yet. know, immune systems deal virus, generally better they'll get it. even matter waiting till ""goes away"", likely never now, dealing still novel us immune systems, well modern medicine. Worst case seasonal corona shot while! 

And try remember, getting mean death. Even 90+ year olds homes survive every day. whole family went delta past late-summer/early-fall.. us got sick.... made through. People getting worked right now.

However.. might worth considering Germany, US, UK, affluent developed countries green-lit booster shots underprivileged nations (especially Africa) access vaccine.

Again, share frustration science-deniers. work medical field can’t quite comprehend people lucky enough access vaccine could ever justify denying it. comment ask pause consider mutations may come communities willingly anti-vax. may want water, access.

American English really embrace ""whilst"" often, much better ""while its"". area high case counts right now, sure. live someplace like US south Delta already burned cases relatively low, community spread less concern matter risk immediate high-risk contacts. vaccinated, boostered, 65, relatively healthy, unvaccinated children elderly home area surging much help anyone sheltering place. Wear mask public, make risk assessment indoors strangers, bad want see friends hug mom almost two years craziness! Say nu variant 2, 3 times contagious Delta. EVEN 100% vaccinated FULL immunity stop spread.

Do understand boosters proposed? protect people first two doses: protected severe disease. ""protect"" vaccinate once.

It trying stop inevitable: get virus people get dose die. cannot stop happening. even annual doses.

You need think yourself, inevitable?

People love think control every outcome. Sometimes cannot, need let go accept limitations modern medicine.

Think yourself, inevitable?   Welcome news 2021. :(  One asymptomatic know sure. Put arm GOT OPTOWRIST  downside waiting cancel, terms refunds such? wait, I'd wait. want jump gun end losing money Nu turns dangerous feared. Biontech data two weeks don’t really understand what’s going wrong here. fairly decent vaccination rate. guess densely populated country still million unvaccinated doesn’t help wanna see family. 2 years.... variant... I'm tired. 2-3x doctors nurses working right world? would come from? Pfizer, neither boosted despite post 6 months. Twitter thread also mentions this. says AZ vaccine might actually work better variant ""We're waiting instructions China"" Maybe it’s distribution networks, technology transfer etc Overall it’s question bottlenecks think availability vaccine issue now

As remember one area countries overthrown patents stating emergency need Brazil South Africa HIV drugs. medications probably relatively easy manufacture. Vaccines much complicated manufacture  No, know heavily mutated possibly transmissible. know causes worse illness yet.  Another point: 
Were really vaccinated? lot people faking it.  Exactly, think ""500%"" figure needless fearmongering. perfectly possible (but proven) Nu spreads easily Delta, doubt large amounts.

What's far interesting interacts immunity, either vaccine-induced prior infection. That's going determine effect Nu western countries. Unfortunately, take little become known. South Africa quite low vaccination rate, fact Nu caused outbreak give us much information subject. 2 cases Hong Kong vaccinated (Pfizer), boostered far know. symptoms cases discovered part mandatory testing quarantine inbound travelers there. thing really infectious say now, you’ll probably already gotten February anyways.  sounds like virus literally turns cells equivalent frag grenades, viral shrapenel :P. proxy - unvaccinated ones taking hospital space cancer, heart attack, stroke accident patients. mask. hinder way.

I'm guessing wear glasses, and/or live somewhere warm humid... New Nu variant  Ah sorry, read article commenting racist issue travel bans. ViX 25 nothing extraordinary  wtf talking Worked New Zealand. 

That it. know immune system works? far understand it, goes like this:

A variant different RNA parent virus

A strain technically also variant, behaves differently parent (beta example strain)

To different virus little complicated. living beings, matter reproduction capability generally. I'm honestly sure would take virus mutate point considered entirely new one, certainly appear anywhere close quite yet. playing, NPCs game know, maybe South Africa charged Europe despite vaccines tested African bodies, fertile environment variants form.
First world nations continue shoot foot name short term capital, humane long term stabilizing solution right front fucking faces. lot spread Africa picking on?

Thats exactly think. test &amp; sequence lot, unvaccinated population Africa whole huge breeding ground mutations. Makes perfect sense SA would place noticed first. Back early days Covid, US even quarantine people flying directly Wuhan. start testing people months after. Uganda started testing people US did.

But China's fault many Americans died. Fair actually think Eric Ding reputable source information jfc. funny thing is, rules driving/using cars protect individual respects them. Prominent example seat belt. Mandatory Germany saves lives. lives ppl using them, don't, accidentally throw someone else car.

And go back historically (like... Talk people lived back then), arguments fights comparable happens today.

Humans weird faster transmission Delta would make thing contagious virus we've ever encountered, margin.

Delta R0 8, measles infects 90% non-immune contacts R0 18.

500% higher transmission would mean R0 40 insane must either false defy least couple laws science.  Thinking canceling ski trip Colorado February this. 

What think? know it’s minor scheme things half fun going bars restaurants that’s table I’m sure see point. spouse triple vaccinated.  information seen yet new variant - OK, super transmissible maybe immunity-dodging, dangerous, dangerous, less dangerous get it?  Look VXX. Today going bloodbath.  Australia created prison camp, doesn’t surprise me. every country cooperative population. don’t think Europe US able impose that. Please continue get vaccinated wear masks. fine /s 

The cycle never end.   South African too, Germany moment, tell SA, definitely wear masks sanitize waaaay countries like Germany.  Many countries never locked barely imposed social distancing point pandemic - wherever located resorted measures past would think likely would new variant really scientists fear.

Manu EU countries already locking 70%+ vaccination rate new variant.. Already happened Australia. People authorised worker list need double jabbed work. updated vaccine.

Timeframe that? It’s significant movement. market moved 1% 3 times already since September. Bet couldn’t name dates times. pretty unsettling. Terrifying, even. We’re right effed, aren’t we. also say lamda, kappa mu variant? variants magically disappeared (at least media)  Hong Kong cases vaccinated. That’s know publicly right now. matter, required EU act time, otherwise Schengen Area pretty much ensures it'll spread think infer much two people, many people would fine Covid even without vaccination Surely ramping summer southern hemisphere  Sorry, current mortality rate Covid there, specific new variant. bad. really whips llamas ass  Theres thing called Economy  mutates bind different receptor, it’ll new strain. 100% correct. Also 2% move nothing. doesn’t even retrace gains previous week. Immunity wears while, need boosters (read: repeat vaccination) maintain protection. regards take new shot every 9 months rest life... well yes... thing go away. countries already beginning straight-up mandate vaccinations (except medical exemptions) hopefully, thinking spreads worry anymore. It’ll named Nu end week. Communism never done, either. Vietnam communist. world capitalist, varying degrees democracy, including none.

Why resistant seeing fucked people are? damaged traumas. People corrupt, people seek power control, people narcissistic, people predators, people abuse others, people abuse kids... part cycles traumas generations.

No, capitalism funds hospitals, prevents rest systems flourishing. Homelessness, poverty, lack education, 'third-world' sub-classes artificially created maintained, exorbitantly wealthy individuals... people allowed breed without proving actually capable parents - news flash - simply capable.

Children abused almost never saved. simply become grotesque disfigures hurt others perpetually. profit goal, we've lost sight important tasks. world's entire ecosystem literally destroyed largest corporations worked decades pollute manipulate species believing things bad (oil companies loved telling people climate change hoax research confirming destruction environment animal life would guaranteed persisted) capitalist, greedy, short-sighted, corrupt way using people resources dumping CO2 methane atmosphere catching form weather extremes.

People still caught Covid time ""catch"" something like this, already spread over. happened Covid first spreading, every variant. remember NYC claiming like 10 cases 2 weeks later city shutdown 500+ people dying day. food water 12 hour flight?! South Africa. many citizens business deals affect? Probably much.

If broke Australia, SE Asia, UK government would probably wait see. say true, fact is, cost two years border closure, months repeated lockdown economic disaster.

Hugs 🤗🤗🤗🤗

Hopefully world comes something allow us live move on. Suspending travel variant detective late already.. Travel areas insufficient testing low vaccination rates preemptively controlled via compulsory PCR testing quarantine   feel bad saying South Africa cesspool right now, it’s economy tatters lawlessness over. Seems like breeding ground new deadly virus little sanitation government control people stop spread mutation. came little surprise current dominant delta strain originated India. original strain started filthy unregulated wet market Wuhan. poor sanitation precursor deadly diseases throughout history invention sanitation products like soap greatly helped extend lifespan humans Masks hurt ears. hate them

But wear need renovating house, spraying hedge.....

...and always Covid risk areas (although vaccinated). Yeah thread seems speculative, I’m sure like that. keep jumping conclusions without data back up.

I hate sensationalism.  Bro... Things okay. lots options fighting virus before. 

I would recommend unplugging news / social media bit. paint bleak possible picture thats gets clicks. nature's way cleaning itself, we're like lice infecting earth. War natural plagues try balance us out. oil price sinking variant several countries released strategic reserves bullets covid cause those. consider ballistic vests vaccines reduce risk.  He's saying came Botswana SA, likely got Botswana European tourist.

Were rush snarky finish reading comment? Came home Thanksgiving current vaccines target original strain really well, Delta slips greater extent, right? Instead vaccine providing close sterilising immunity stopping transmission, seems mainly stop severe outcomes death.

If change variant spike protein targeting match Nu better, make less effective stopping Delta, Alpha Wuhan, changing types antibodies body create. might stop Nu wave, new Delta/Delta derivative could spring wake.

A good option might mix Nu/Delta vaccine one vial, get half dose two vaccines.   Maybe people realizing current behaviors won’t stand “new” strain showing tiniest bit self awareness aren’t enough current strain. Probably optimistic that.  Yet unvaccinated fault staying home taking precautions /s could transmissible less lethal right?

No.

Let's stop repeating nonsense.

It becomes transmissible equally lethal happened far, nearly 2 years this. source? read another comment separate post symptoms weren’t severe I’m sure believe Naturopaths DO's different critters. Can't read? Updated data Merck today shows anti-viral pill drops 50% 30% efficacy. course release disappointing data morning Thanksgiving viruses do, routinely mutate. Especially vaccinate people put travel restrictions. basically puts pressure virus create escape mutation.

This likely escape caused vaccination. like overuse antibiotics MRSA. could happened person immunocompromised carried virus long time. appeared Africa, far less % people vaccinated anywhere else world. Hong Kong patients double vaxxed believed booster. 

Both asymptomatic. hermit threat society - move along.

In case aware, lot people US guns. lot cases, semi-automatic even fully automatic rifles, depending state. get pissed off, I'd consider pretty damn big threat. 

Also, Germany smaller state Montana. there's that.   Cough cough much transmissible get? thought delta bad enough. pretty relaxed, asked curiosity. don't...neither know severe. media hype right actual data comes out.  would virus mutate deadly destroy host effectively killing ? curious Unfortunately nice one make. :( want over.

Yes absolutely especially existing vaccines prove effective vs. it.

There's way little data know much yet - definitely possible new variant actually good thing. upvote speaking truth- it’s like watching train wreck slow motion. hard look away… May unpopular opinion, think travel areas world low vaccine uptake high potential new variants (such Africa) always subject quarantine testing 6 days booster. go around less worry?  Israel Hong Kong well. point ""top health expert"" calling politician doctors scientists working asses inform us virus quite distasteful. Happy I'm getting booster week. *has potential a* positive thing I've seen, since Gottleib still quiet, people saying ""yes, could bad, promise take us way square one."" think soon tell really hope, can't imagine lockdowns. fear lot mass violence government mandated lockdowns US. country mentally unstable people clearly pushed personal limits think anyone themselves. think lockdown might necessary depending variant, it’s hard feel confident 30% fellow Americans capable acting rationally anymore. tracked listed here: quite many 5, plus mutations sub-variants. No. burn others. We'll rid summer. one hoopy frood.  I'm triple vaxed headed DisneyWorld Xmas unless Nu becomes monster seen evidence of. judge risk tolerance though. Old way, quarantine. example, person article vaccinated. was, perhaps would still caught it, would less likely.

Well, kinda depends, right. *If* variant escapes immunity, might actually matter. would huge issue. don’t know yet. unless primers looking gene dropout. ""But someone think industry's Q4-earnings bottom line!""  Yeah unironically point living anymore lol pressure less severe virus likely transmit. Think way, right now, lot vaccinated people forgoing protective measures isolate sick. virus present symptoms going spread well conditions. Whether evolutionary change occurs, remains seen. infections, less severe viruses trend time symptoms noticed, chance infect others drops sharply. Yes since developed symptoms 11 days back Belgium got Egypt (confirmed) didn’t get symptoms 11 days crazy long incubation period. gosh. plenty places mask mandates still, capacity restrictions kind. Indoor dining still popular, gyms require masks etc.

Best tell looking US data still much pandemic unvaxed. Yes breakthrough cases thing, unvaxed area 10x case counts impressive considering less 10% adult population. booked yet

Sorry, saying people ""just lazy totally meant get around it"" given pass? Vaccines prevent infection, irrelevant data point. severity illness post infection. Asymptomatic *so far*. Hopefully way through.

But yeah positive news right now. problem don’t see ever ending. 

People wanted vaccine gotten now. Maybe still left maybe willing jump fence soon…but…are new variant requires new series vaccines keep pushing fight? many people burnt out..we still many people unvaccinated original beta variant…to means continue face constant cycle mutations…not saying end world shit like that..but seems like living new age dominated Covid it’s mutation phases least next decade. Nu variant. Right really know much may reduce vaccine efficacy maybe transmissible. think we'll actually better understanding especially things like less severe Delta vaccine efficacy etc?  Eh, also world war going enabled spread US Europe rapidly Cases almost tripled show sign slowing down. Depending style, could quarter sauce, quarter cheese, half dough.  oh Yes, happens every new variant. 

New variant appears, it’s contagious deadly!, everyone gonna die!!, end!!! Nothing happens. Wait next variant. Bingo! Unfortunately correct. Even variant ends lethal, doubt states like Texas anything it. seriously limits ability USA respond everywhere work together. 

I live Texas. Sadly population given regards covid beyond apathetic towards virus. I'd like think virus becomes lethal people would change but, going last year, optimistic happening. currently assume everyone get least exposed corona. right but.. didn’t last time, won’t time either. Hi hi pharmacist here. Burnout always bad healthcare, difference break meant temporary. feels different time. Numbers don’t tell whole story. know nothing, Jon Snow. 

(A game thrones reference 2021. tell miss times?) fuck talking about? Florida got dick slapped delta Influenza get much focus droplets, fomites surface cleaning, hindered recognition Covid mainly airborne.

Even gauze masks would helped reduce droplet transmission, like surgical masks today. Neither type mask particularly effective preventing inhalation smaller aerosols. You’re getting downvoted saying slow apocalypse won’t survive stupid thing say Huh? It’s asap rocky song, comment makes sense need Americans stupid, we're double screwed “Vaccine evasive” usually means evading antibodies front line defense symptoms. memory cells protect severe disease/death - that’s understanding escapes immunity spreads 8 times faster delta, going cause way way severe outcomes

On population level? Yes. individual level? necessarily. Well, want enter lockdown/no-lockdown discussion, cases would bad news, one limited freedom, lot people would die...
Let's hope vaccines quickly updated variant reveal true threat. Supposedly woman recently travelled Egypt fully vaccinated rate 14%, wouldn’t necessarily put anti-Vaxxer.  Here's deal ... \*measured\* 7 days. measure 1,2,3... magically 0 immunity 6.9999 days suddenly switches 100 7. 6 days probably 80% immunity get 7 days (but double-blind study saying so). may 1% day 8, but, again, measure :)

If vaccinated, probably worry anyway. Boosted, much less (even 6 days).

For worth, press release reported data 7+ Either way, certainly hurt! It’s likely could “apocalypse” variant forces permanent mandatory mask mandates shutdowns non-essential businesses. works specific time frame, though. effective reproductive rate 1 old variant would infected many people, taken longer get all. 

So (with proviso strain healthcare capacity would different), old variant would still kill people eventually. Legit question: Spanish flu deadly enough put pressure virus become less lethal, random fluke mutation?

One thing I’ve heard original Spanish flu strain killed people quickly. could explain evolutionary pressure become mild. COVID, even people kills, usually takes while, leaving window open person still spread virus. Meaning less evolutionary pressure become mild. 

I mean, doesn’t mean *cant* become mild. fluke predictable outcome. I'm guessing mean it'll reduce vaccine efficacy make completely ineffective. vaccine still help maybe well variants like say Delta. That's I've gathered news articles. Come on, numbers vaccinated hospitals minimal place zero strain hospital facilities, point no?

So close borders vaccinated people tourists cause hardship. Sounds reasonable. Hopefully right. good point. Could originated anywhere really. Well one thing know variants going continue thing time, proceed accordingly. Data Pfizer's pill, following analysis study involving 1,200 participants, showed 89% reduction risk coronavirus-related hospitalizations deaths compared Lol ok make opposite numbers - 10 times contagious, 1/100 severe - suddenly great thing. can't state fact something true predicated hypothetical.

It certainly COULD good thing, idea right Yes--the booster dose restores full efficacy within 7 days 6 days nearly there. someone pretending expert words seem oblivious take different connotations time. Cry bothers much that's reality language. read reports going name Sars-Cov-3 consider ""new"" virus mutations. Time tell. part small data size makes sense. amount people affected delta compounds small sample problem. think got it. Thanks. make vaccines transmissible via mosquito? Say, genetically modified malaria auras COVID immunity. sounds safe, right? Everyone concerned go get booster. “could”. 

I swear, things turn wrong (not saying will, it’s uncertain), way media reports really undeserved number scientists’ credibility. evidence, may well Belgium. assumption variant monitoring would robust Belgium would already detected elsewhere spreading, could wrong Important note South Africa exceptionally good testing, probably due HIV hub. South Africa detecting mean came there. better candidate someone vaccinated, ""prime"" all. covid still relatively low rate severe illness overall Florida manipulate numbers arrest someone calling out?  Whooda thunkit  traveling around extendeding pandemic? Life suffering, ends. Quicker come terms that, happier be. *throws plane* BS, vaccacinated act like can't spread virus Germany bigger problem, iam vaxxed iam careful Co workers etc fck whole unvaxxed problem thing \*abdicated

sorry 1/10 deadly Delta, spreads 100 times faster, yes, pretty much us would get would months, healthcare services would completely overloaded months, causing even deaths.

Well, let's wait see ... Yeah, sound pleasant all. markets certainly spooked. lot contagious variants actually spread certain countries. Gamma variant, swept across South America, outcompeted Alpha there, Europe. Beta variant, prevalent SA Delta, spread much outside Africa. push date back necessary. Yep. fear instant isolation country finds new variant disincentivize genomic surveillance less well countries. Asymptomatic carriers also godsend virus

That depends. Transmission rate also seems proportionate viral load symptoms. opposite ;( really early stocks react way. media overselling dangers variant early. Right. someone chose get vaccinated, made choice. see tried responsible suffer sure hope so. hate say something seems turn true, reading post today gave shivers. ""Calls air force"" sounds dramatic. armed forces simply federally owned ICU medivac planes organizationally kept operated. Maybe avoid news while… ""nu"" variant detected normal PCR test due lucky mutation. That's sudden cases discovered. Everyone going back looking previous tests searching indicator differentiates ""nu"" Delta/etc. Prior yesterday one really knew variant. Ohhhh Silvio Meanwhile local politician everywhere said nothing value. Go outside man stop worrying media yes shit real don’t locked house rest life trashing vaccines daily US Canada. Huh? Scientists concerned, see kinda doubt Nature fear-mongering. don’t think we’re doomed anything like that, seem something keep mind pro-active about. problem could easily spread counties vaccinated spawn new variants.. Kinda like what's happening. means things drag longer. unvaccinated person travelling like first place?  I'm coming conclusion covid really strangely geographically cyclical way understood yet. US live southeast got hammered earlier late summer early fall. slowed tremendously hammering northern midwest. Trust me, anything locally stop spread hard explain moment spared.

There's certain randomness virus hard decipher. frustrating thing lust likes/retweets spreading unverified unproven claims clearly damaging mental health taking comments face value hard push back on. talk lot obvious physical damage done health believe anti-vaccine rhetoric, panic laden posts/tweets real harm well. 

Folks need let actual experts real research come hard conclusions take half baked data that's context run social media. work ministry generalizations? US, particularly conservative circles, demonized ignoring NPIs downplaying virus. Although there's excuse complete scientific ignorance lack respect keeping heath care system functioning reasonably, point vaccines therapeutics available most, healthy middle ground, erring side getting back normal, best solution. Lockdowns worthless. Closing schools harm good. COVID plague, smallpox. living COVID forever get recover fine.  It’s like… yeah. Yep. Yes.  illegal ration care emergency? Simple math says 100% transmission right? Let's ride upcoming panic. think new formulation, need safety trial. exactly would make brave case? Plain freaking idiot, nothing else. doesn’t someone something “conspiracy” subreddit? spread much misinformation! know...but actions effect others. frustrating. Plus types would said thing Aids decades. side them. doesn’t make sense. mutations coming patients w/ immune suppression can’t clear virus. seems like they’re people vax aren’t efficacious in. wasn’t bad 2010 so. lived USA little decade general consensus USA good place back then. Now, international diaspora disagrees statement Lol. Holiday Mode well prepared.

Cheers! fellas panic buying time? Might well get discounts since it’s Black Friday. reaction stock markets bearing scientific facts. stock markets variations caused impulse buying selling. means absolutely nothing science wise. Operation Barn Door. I'm adult know better question current capitalist development paths. well good artificial surface, something wrong relationship nature. 15 yo capable seeing this, intelligent you. Maybe getting would serious make immune. Spot on, suffer depression relate 100% OP said Point note: viruses don’t want anything. replicate long enough infect people, whether kill host irrelevant. Sure, extending transmission time favorable, ultimately live spreading month die irrelevant. 1 millionth time posted  Fine Print ticket \*the risk death zero\* Yeah. classic case critical thinking.

Let's say every country infected one person variant

A person flies Uganda Scotland returns 

Sure, could pick variant. chances *one* person coming contact *one* infected Scot extremely slim.

It suggests case Egypt non-significant number. source that? R 40 would crazy, even reduced mortality.  thinking. _not_ getting chimeric ( ""mixed"" ""combined"" diseases) viruses here. really easy nature. Actually difficult labs too. it’s evidence based  guess long global air travel occurs, every epidemic become pandemic.

If airborne/respiratory. (other) bodily fluid kinds manageable places others. sensed snark too. unsnarked here, it’s good. really hate scare mongering comments like   I'm certainly expert topic (the experts I've listened say viruses tend get less deadly) think longer incubation times generally caused reduced replication rate make virus less deadly secondary effect. can't really think way could mutate longer incubation time severe maybe possible. Hope not. even heard sick people diagnosed are. get hospitalized? Yep.

Thus physical measures critical use addition vaccines.

Unfortunately, luck would it, people fucking idiots. Mutations equal worse. one dumbest takes , USA what, 20 times number covid cases south africa? variants could easily popping USA , luck draw , also sure US proactive monitoring new variants population statistics side effects tracked caused vaccinations given young kids? guesstimate we'll know more? I'm glad Europe really proactive strain. Wish US would be. reading provide sort evidence claim giving two data points arguing one few.  think antivaxxers 1st world thing? They're not. Every country world nutjobs.  plausible hypothesis maybe decade ago might still something I'm relieved trials giving people worms cure allergies work out..

I'm gonna double anything I've said, assumption BOD guy knows he's talking about, giving incorrect info MSNBC like would open potential shareholders lawsuit.  


But answer trials less onerous first time around. always possible second part could accelerated too. like, either way, that's disastrous timeline. kind amazing. Man, remember watching jan 2020.

""hmmm""

""oh no""

""OH NO""  Citation needed. No. world ending Mayans right. slightly dyslexic.  Viral load (i.e infectivity) peaks day *before* symptoms show Delta. guess overall point could well infectious delta, painting mythical super variant premature. detected multiple countries, clearly present Belgium likely Egypt, around time. key first look south african deaths/hospitalizations see bad is.  long continues eliminate hospitalization death I’ll happy.

I’m sure we’ve point. basically saying vaccines dangerous vaccinated countries produce dangerous variants???

No, know drew post.

It's vaccine *induces* emergence vaccine evading variants - may well likely decrease odds new variant emerging all. time, *if* vaccine evading variant emerges, I'd expect likely happen highly vaccinated population. 

Polio good comparison anyway, virus far stable, measles.  recent study longer-term follow-up participants phase 2–3 randomized trial BNT162b2 vaccine9 showed reduction vaccine efficacy 96% (in period 7 days &lt;2 months receipt second dose) 84% (in period 4 months approximately 7 months receipt second dose), indicated decrease protection factor four (i.e., tiny drop worry much mean yeah Congo … sorry, ""young woman"" makes absolutely ""prime candidate"" severe illness, would ""old male"". one point (unvaccinated) favor, two (young, female) against. case belief since separate quarantine hotel rooms across hallway. Could course somehow messed things up, details online interested. Yeah, like said im afraid making sick, it’s the, like, bullshit surrounds mild asymptomatic case. It’s dumb, working worries therapist like said, afford see month, time next appointment, things may different different set worries. 

Im worry vomiting point. never able vaccinate whole world fast enough, right 53% world population vaccinated least ONE dose. We're fast enough producing it, delivering it, give people. time chances another problematic variant, see win without virus giving up, honestly. Good effort think ""we"" good job, good efficient safe vaccine developed distributed year strong feat, limits production logistic big problem especially poorest countries, 8 billion people. undercooked leftover turkey wish share? Wait several months we're dealing variant supersedes one. confusion ""nu"" ""new"" spoken communication get really serious probably result costly mistakes form. imagine would cause supply lines shut down. Massive food shortages farms can't get enough people show up, distributors can't get enough truckers, grocers can't get enough workers stay open.

I'd curious see situation like affected elections. Unvaccinated people international travel middle pandemic, Jesus Christ.... Thx comment need They’re punished, good advanced knowledge don’t use it? Seriously study all? Yes, quarantine them. tongue cheek. Sorry. Sarcasm hard convey.. made winky face. Me: feels superior level-headed reactions COVID.

Also me: listens fucking furry Twitter. shit? effective hair loss treatment rare side effects. course could. generally speaking, I'd guess mutation would likely emerge vaccinated individual, else equal. Everyone needs take enormous chill pill right now.

This new variant Likely compete delta. Chise scientist worked Covid vaccine. says little cause concern right now, thread highly suggest read it. Calm down, media hyping reality little get panicked one thing going tell today IGNORE media clickbait headlines new variant. plausible scenario take us back square one lot misinformation currently circulating. Working thread  animal reservoirs. won’t go away Covid weird middle ground scary, quite scary enough change behaviour **stupid**. Less scary we'd probably consider another flu, scary we'd react like ebola would beaten it. like evil Goldilocks.

ftfy  Dude, every one “the big one.” tonne people dead nothing changing really. Michigan gets direct flights South Africa. saying. remember earlier year like 2-3 months feeling pandemic vaccines heavily bringing things down. delta happened.

This time around. barely booster week. Lmfao. 

Hopefully Nu overhyped  Israel, Belgium Hong Kong entire sub mocks ignorant people making uneducated judgment calls nothing making wild speculative assumptions something little evidence support statements. keep mind deadly virus = people isolation starts spread. people precautions. people vaccinating. 
When people hear relatives have/had new covid variant less severe, less inclined anything it, actually helps new variant lot could call Pooh instead Xi. evolve less deadly… sometimes mutating deadlier variants first kill bunch people burning out. **People can’t grasp don’t understand fundamentals evolution.**

Ironic post displaying profound misunderstanding viral evolution.

HIV essentially 100% fatal effective treatments available decades. burn out?

The thing matters virus much spread. matter happens host host infected enough others.

COVID long enough infectious period, individuals, symptoms become debilitating individual dies. allows deadly variants spread effectively even higher mortality rates.

It matter 1% 100% patients die 3 weeks exposure if, 2 weeks, walking around feeling mostly fine infecting others. purely speculative. See thoughts Hey friend, please consider getting therapy doom filled internet echo chambers. distressing post, take care yourself.  Yeah really wait see many breakthroughs conpared delta breakthroughs. knows Well, Hong Kong, vaccinated individual transmitted another vaccinated individual indirectly doorway (infected individual opens doorway - later person opposite door also opens door becomes infected - basically insignificant ""contact"" imagine) (extremely noisy unreliable) data SA suggests might vaccine protection (9 19 cases, 1 sequenced breakthrough case, vaccinated, vaccination rate \~30%) I've seen sort thing American Dad, means totally possible.  hear nowadays, believe even person vaccinated, could still spread around. means matter vaccinated unvaccinated, international travel(especially red marked nations) risk others.  chances transmissable, less deadly?

Not Greek letter named varients super newsworthy long may missed them. sort came went got outcompeted varients used hearing of, particularly Delta. 

Mu Lamda remain varients interest, others never got bumped varients concern downgraded former varients interest. one, Omicron, jumped straight varient concern. pandemic, response pandemic things. sooner people realize government holding us hostage, unvaccinated, sooner get back normal new. They've almost 2 years analyze situation, look demands study population disease statistics. situation obvious lack funding -- they're currently tossing around multi-TRILLION dollar spending packages Congress.

Only true testing people get diagnosed early enough drug effective. aren’t yet.

Plus, really expect unvaccinated people (who driving surge hospitalizations, death) seek testing second get symptoms take medicine? subscriptions lagged like Epsilon, Theta Zeta used VOI longer monitored (likely outcompeted Delta). sure used new variants crop up. vaccine stopped pandemic? *remembers tweet said evidence human human transmission Covid 19*

Covid-era funerals basically pre-gaming death point. fking embarrassing response. fking close borders get data. Better safe sorry, fking imbecile. Better stock TP non-perishables. one going ride.  used go school time sick, nothing new here. never late flatten waves enforced border quarantines. 
New dominant strains next wave usually sneak prior wave. ""Go back fucking Belgium""
-Gordon Ramsey sounds like merck re-purposed ivermectin lmao would bad. Belgium lol not? What's limit? Lol, think there's lot people US think witchcraft real? Reddit reading fucked China late January 2019, next day sick... Covid, I'm pretty sure. thought cases states time, recovered symptoms Covid became publicly known, checked almost boxes. NYC. time, many coworkers acquaintances also came something really bad. Covid-19 US long anyone even knew.  Lockdowns definitely work. United States fucking half-ass attempt so. Italy already reduced 9 months validity ""green pass"", necessary pretty much anything. Michigan get direct flights Johannesburg. You’d connect DC, Atlanta, NYC would anywhere states. Take upvote  Everyone eligible really enthusiastic getting vaccines right? Stop living fear. Get vaccinated go normal life. Meanwhile Ireland can't get PCR test massive demand overwhelmed system Well. they? mean, Trump got blamed Biden said plan. 

So expect side. 

Biden pushing vaccines mandatory fashion new variant occurs drop numbers, side suddenly plan. probably bunch nothing folks looking hope. 

Perhaps push Biden stop CDC FDA playing slow game. could new RNA vaccine month, still going require month trials? guess see, depending real threat Nu is. even math? Exploding means pace infections accelerating rapidly, large number infections. 2800/day 600/day last week.

Doing nothing someone shares information effective nothing one shares information you.

Stunningly stupid statement. guess China shared info, everyone gone day let virus spread everyone infected. Yep. think good news say, slow sequencing process isn’t needed.

I’m still unclear though whether says PCR tests detect infection one PCR test also tell infection due variant, PCR tests detect infection due variant. think it’s former.  said there. selective pressure comes response it. Essentially likelihood deathly sick person nastier variant spreads others goes awareness safety measures. ""sneakier"" cases minimal damage remain active enough spread.

But depends global efforts. vaccinated conservatives enjoy luxury.

Unvaccinated conservatives next November probably much anything ground.  Sounds like someone supports Brandon 🤪  seem though understood thesis post impossible data now

Would advise take look front page every news site world right lol... Quick, what's percentage vaxxed vs unvaxxed there. Without that, give fuck. like 10 1 unvaxxed. 

Let rot. happens don’t abide lockdown?

Cases get control hundreds thousands people die virus. (Not government lol) great hear, find this? something HIV, really.  


It survived someones body long enough able mutate several times. able person immunocompromised. 


It could happened someone Lupus, make airborne lupus mean first case Omicron Prime Wow, pretty far past Delta old Greek Alphabet... like ""Delta"" ""Nu"" variants named Greek letters. dropped, stopped. still 4.5k YTD, seems like dropping unless something new comes out. market spook suppose? don’t want live planet anymore  immediately? No, let’s give everyone days panic travel get patient zeros chance return home…  You’re right unfortunately people desensitized point they’re willing risk lives we’re going lose. Yes, good news purpose detection. Alpha variant property. Labs use particular type PCR test (which widely used) make distinction Alpha/Omicron variants time determine whether test positive. That's means it'll much faster easier track thing. Right now, followup sequencing probably still needs done, Alpha might still around small numbers. Omicron gains foothold, one start assume tests exhibit gene target failure Omicron.  Indeed right that, risky behavior people still get shots.

But foolish think vaccines alone would prevent new strain spreading.  still don’t understand. intent affect findings? I’m actively looking new variants I’m testing everyone. new variant find nothing. half population new variant find that. Forget Nu, happened Omega? vote calling Dirk. declared Omicron 2 hours ago. Prior that, *assumed* Nu everyone else. would afraid called Omega mention collapse health care caused high cases burnout.  problem steadily solving itself. Next variant list: COVID-19 Mega-destructotron variant. proves need send vaccines developing countries.  u fking mate ELI5? I’m praying version transmissible less dangerous. screwed. Even Delta evade vaccines anywhere near rate media makes seem. absurdly contagious unvacinated individuals.

SA 21% vaxed, really way know. ""The Omicron Variant"" sounds way much like title paperback thriller buy airport. fucks sake. scientist woman comment nonsensical. whole lot. reason concern transmissibility vaccine efficacy due mutated strain (30 mutated spike proteins, vs. Delta's 17). fucking magic bullet. Half people ventilators die. 'enough beds ventilators' solution. wish anyone end ICU covid, matter full half empty ICU. daughter got delta 10 days exposed nothin vaccination status. first four infected Botswana fully vaccinated: 

“The variant also identified Botswana. country’s health ministry confirmed statement four cases new variant detected people fully vaccinated. four tested planned travel.” (Source: New York Times) Source happen. ""Right now, talking sort like red flag might issue, know.""

What? Nice analogy! even vaccines effective variant variant still infects humans, believe would possible variant less deadly. 

Honestly, COVID mutates avoid vaccines ends roughly bad common cold, I'd fine that. I'd get vaccine variant available though would like get sick.  That’s citizenship works. Well BJ want trip India......... Hongkong one came Canada. Well I'm screwed lmao Lrrr, omicron variant. skipped Nu probably avoid confusion ""new"". also skipped Xi. guess why. far phizer looks really good   havent SA wouldnt say thay enough vaccines. true though lot anti-vax sentiment. US result &lt;30% vaccination? Im sure  Thank service! Yes agree. mean use word fear something said read/hear almost daily different platforms. Sorry - mean that! 

Weigh risks/benefits, take precautions keep facts.

That do.

Good luck you. Hope get Colorado. love there! anyone think new variant resistant vaccines countries would actually go full lockdown again? honestly don’t see happening… least USA. No, are!  No, 1.5% Portuguese adults haven’t covid vaccine. Ireland 7%.
 
Maybe difference Portugal considered people prior covid infection last 6 months “fully vaccinated” one dose?
  gonna okay, friend? Sending virtual warm blanket cup tea internet. feel coming from. pandemic hard brains wired handle ongoing stress long. Bloom lab great, Dr. Bieniasz. 

Hope best prepare worst. Hate challenge worldview, but, “uhm”, see sentences New York Times article -

The variant also identified Botswana. country’s health ministry confirmed statement four cases new variant detected people fully vaccinated. four tested planned travel. summary: amazingly effective. doubt has. “Exploding”? US currently 28 times cases per capita 4x high positivity South Africa 

There’s already least one case Belgium linked counties list, plus 2 Israel 

Containment futile situation, travel bans disincentivize counties sharing info outbreaks general, makes likely something contained isn’t it’s kept hidden fear reprisal Beats substituting wishes opinions data. sources like: 

- Daniel Griffon Friday episoldes Week Virology (twiv) always good. look forward he’ll say he’s working today.

- think r/COVID19 really good. Chatter days still comments content-full. 

- Dr Topol Scripts. twitter feed like curated annotated r/COVID19.

- Dr. Fiegle-Ding bit emotional also sifts explains latest research.

- Dr Wachter UCSF solid too, rarely adds sources say. Ok excellent analogy. vaccines come here? One fav Metallica songs. # would way less critical vaccinated. take basic precaution wanted travel another continent pandemic... mean, cares society Lol what? That's dumb age good. Go /r/nursing, there's lot people second third careers. Almost key word.....especially viruses similar C19. mean, shut literally everything immediately locked everyone homes, we'd done COVID month. However, would cause many issues would potentially much devastating COVID, including things already affected COVID like supply chain. Hard feel optimistic much moment. behavior collectively going change much (collectively) learning lessons, really even are, enough people effectively pro-virus can't shut door. 

Pretty much hope 'weaker' variant, maybe communicable less damage. vote reddit gives nickname ""Lrrr"" would make first case Omicron Prime fact allowed travel internationally.

Ohh true dat. WTF doing? unvaxxed, get travel (with exceptions course) considering many lives putting risk Yeah found first case country followed path person met past days case still chance prevent spreading. Meanwhile borders open turns later people died country month first case detected Well easy. go indoor places unmasked people. Lrrr, ruler planet Omicron Persei 8! Whelp standard operating procedures many countries around world. Hell, Japan lowered recently 6 days vaccinated travelers recently. 

Its maybe, maybe, traveling global health crisis encouraged first place. Link? One Belgium confirmed. Unvaccinated 30yo coming back trip Egypt.  Can't trial administering medications, possible? would reduce chances virus making strains would make medications ineffective.  Egyptian doctor would dance street ever hit 40% vaccination rate mark :( Yes probably elderly people children planes. Yeah, get fuck outta already appointment booster booked next Friday really hope variant isn’t bad sounds boosted antibodies level able stop/reduce it.

But I’m worried even bypass antibodies assume booster also boost t/b-cell response aren’t fooled variants. Ah understand now. apologize misinterpreted you. lot people right overreacting bit trying say permanent travel restrictions etc straight dystopian horror movie. get little hot headed people say destroys public trust public health. misinterpreted saying definitely apologize! right, lot good places US Canada worth visiting. song never ends 
It goes 'round 'round, friends 
Some people started singing 
Not knowing 
And continue singing forever because... that's guaranteed, current vaccines still need tested new Ask doctor Noble Eightfold Path right you! Actually they're supposedly asymptomatic problem partially-effective vaccines. known scientifically long million mutation. need 1 mutate right direction fuck rhe entirety humanity. 

Guess what, covid enough space mutate millions times want sell newspapers, isn't. New Zealand 42 deaths total . Alabama. (with similar population ) 16000


A complete total failure indeed unvaccinated person allowed enter country without pcr quarantine? Right fully vaxxed people protecting 40% catching Delta variant offer good protection hospitalization. still catch spread disease. vaccine without masks social distancing like wearing seatbelt airbag. discover variety it’s always everywhere Tell people saying game over, doomed. “Adolescents might need boosters point, ""it less likely will, healthy, strapping teenagers much better stronger immune response elderly person. gulp say elderly truth,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director National Institutes Allergy Infectious Diseases, told CNN's John Berman Wednesday 


I’m elderly immune compromised fuck would need booster? mouth.  vaccine-evading variant ever comes around actually likely emerge highly vaccinated countries

Countries low vaccination rates eventually high rates natural immunity (or may high rates already, probably case SA). create similar pressures evade antibodies, since cases higher, there'll opportunities mutation. Evolutionary fitness reproduction. Period. Faster cheetahs, smarter apes, cuter dogs fit kids, average. Evolution, things equal, favor genetic variants tend lead offspring, period. talk levels selection (my favorite field) bio 101 that’s pretty much worry about.

With viruses, you’re looking easily spreads. virus quickly incapacitating less likely spread, things equal, infected person usually become less likely interactions people. However, factors lead infectiousness (how easy given exposure cause infection) independent quickly kills you. turn lethality infectiousness, end either cancelling (same level spread) even disease deadly contagious.

It definitely lead astray take general rule thumb like “less deadly viruses spread equally” interpret kind universal law. I'm understanding saying correctly unvaccinated people could really screwed variant. Correction: change tackle covid.

Because know deal it, us simply decide to.

Say goodbye illusion humans ""rational animals"". Sure. I’m saying people shouldn’t travel internationally. want to, go it. It’s longer priority me. US blessed lot amazing, diverse, beautiful places. really want see places Canada. important fact *appears now* put competing delta Nu strain, right still mostly unvaxxed people hospital, might bode well vaccine's protection. Travel restrictions never really worked well anyway. lockdowns effective. first story saw said determined yet current vaccines effective.. So, know easy start worrying worst case scenarios.. one travelling countries pandemic. get need move food/goods it. Everyone else (politicians, business, family) use video/phone calls.  invent new process coat plastic vials thin layer glass using sputtering technique. think that's much concern time around. says words “evidence based “ y’all swoon. he’ll send emails private masks don’t really work…but public insists do. happened wearing double masks ? Vix levels twice already year. Bet can’t guess times It'd still better virus could walk around even longer 2 weeks infecting people. New variant, Tiger King 2 out, feels like Groundhog day... Belgian person unvaccinated flu symptoms reflect vaccinated audience gets pandemic news YouTube going skew far toward conspiratorial read/watch/listen traditional media. uncertainty. We'll know soon turn another boring grind. also said delta variant and, oops, one disappear. lived world took pandemics disease transmission half-seriously decades leading this

Not true, least US presidents parties putting together measures place act accordingly scenario deadly pandemic may happen. perfect storm happened inept self-centered president US history. rest world, efforts prevent control pandemics partnership WHO.

That said, guarantees life, even best efforts can't guarantee see deadly pandemic spread. Remember according laws statistics simulation, small chance something may happen, happen given ample time. US also done 40 times many tests. test positivity rate South Africa twice high US.

Comparing cases rich countries (with vast resources) cases poorer countries (where mass testing possible) best ignorant worst disingenuous.  Yes. worse worser goes. understanding Delta, contagious variant, outcompeted others essentially took dominant variant. Proceed like normal would guess. think humanity dumb uncoordinated. Imagine there's team ""pro-COVID"" wants spread virus much possible. Keep international travel? Check. border restrictions? Check. entry quarantine requirements? Check. vaccine mandates? Check.

Virus give shit freedoms. Clinical trials shown vaccines offer less protection Beta variant. Genetic sequencing suggests new variant shares immunity evasion mutation. similar concern Mu variant; also similar vaccine-resistant mutation.

The question whether new variant becomes globally dominant outcompete Delta strain. reason simple - barely 2 days since variant became talk internet, so, almost anything else answer - one knows yet competition. Oh didn’t know? Fauci reevaluating “fully vaccinated” considered. can. read today changes like mRNA vaccines would require regulatory reapproval would take max 6 weeks. sure long production changes would take auntie evolves balls she’ll become uncle. Also wrong. transmitted droplets  Yep Guaranteed already undercook turkey? Right jail, right away. Mexico use four color alert system: Green, Yellow, Orange, Red. 

The time pandemic passed green right midterm elections.

Before big festivity (Christmas, St. Valentine's, Independence Day, Mother's Day) took color. 

They refused move system red even numbers said should, moving instead ""Orange Maximum Alert"". 

It ridiculously obvious doing, yet lots people bought it. Delta new variant, *was* objectively contagious. Sometimes new variants fizzle sometimes don't. hoped lockdown would enough. 

I hoped getting vaccinated would enough. 

Hope pandemic done nothing ; allow leaders control us before.  Laugh mock want; guys one saying get vaccinated all
Go away. listened. Maybe it’s time guys listen too? mean I'm really trying negative think that's true al.

If live US suspect live somewhere west coast liberal city think that's going.


This country operating. People rarely wear masks, people distancing anymore. airport grocery store none happening majority country Serious portfolio potentially, serious terms pandemic... maybe Brit here.

I highly doubt incompetent government anything response this. Yes, lowest number cases Europe dramatically changing.

My sister doctor local hospital. Running beds several red (Covid) wards going. NHS already straining Peppa Pig loving PM care.

No doubt get new variant UK doubt government anything response it. They've scrapped mandates masks, social distancing, travel working home. get public transport work, bus train, hardly anyone wears mask social distances.

Pisses off.  world still marched back normal despite delta. Even US lifted travel restrictions Europe well. current level Covid restriction fatigue don’t see permanent rolling travel restrictions cards all. Covid become endemic eventually treated such.   Considering there’s never indication variant left reliance upon staying within “droplets” air, think it’s needs find articles read. currently working well.. thats naive understanding major VOCs emerged countries low vaccination numbers. Alpha UK start 2021, quickly followed beta SA, gamma brazil delta India. capable evading vaccines various degrees(though completely) caused major waves deaths around world.  almost like travelling around world pandemic... Oh shit oh fuck 


Here's hoping best  Tokyo here, largest city world. 27 new cases yesterday - lowest level since last year think. Plenty areas around country zero new cases. Vaccination rates getting nearly 80%. Masks public 90%+ people. 

What fuck US doing. Vaccinated guy Hong Kong got gave vaccinated man staying across hall hotel quarantine. Dumb people seem like commenting platforms allow everyone commenting dumb course. Just, know lot subject see bunch morons dominating discussions it, likely decide worth time effort try correct them. 

It's like trying bar hop across city correct people making similar incorrect statements conversations, unfortunately reach much larger audience online. Stocking benzos Upvote moon  Egypt recently would ask people would travel US. predominany response was, ""Oh no, dangerous"". argument, letting addicts die letting pain patients keep medicine. pain patients saying whole time apparently kind thinking ok comes vaccines reason.  Right... vaccination rate Gauteng something like double that. Even entire population vaccinated going die out. vaccinated still contracting spreading variants vaccinated for. may lower rate still happening.  Woo hoo 2022. America opening boarders open full capacity without masks. fun new normal. Similar Wuhan good testing SARS necessarily original Covid came either That’s thinking point. There’s way variant hadn’t already circulating weeks (if months) already, it’s become noticed.

It’s entirely possible introduced regions high concentrations Delta simply couldn’t compete, instead gained traction quite possibly place world without many Delta cases floating around.

people going back old ways already even though there's still direct threat. I'm sure went thorough trials possible would fare better 30%? (This seems way legit ivermectin covid). much thorough safety record brand new drug. Literally second paragraph, ”The preliminary report revealed four fully vaccinated Covid-19”. think missing point post replied to, know already significantly spread outside SA. Highly likely already US 1) coronavirus (delta) far contagious flu, US fairly low vaccination rate. 2) idea. evades completely Pfizer Moderna need update vaccines, get vaccinated again? teensy bit, we're talking days weeks. even close enough time gather enough data anything substantive. PR move. hope doesn’t cause us skip months trials. vaccine untested ends harm good, truly fucked antivaxxers would suddenly like 80 percent population. strong feeling one way other. don’t need South Africa downplay Omicron’ severity economic reasons. enough mistake let Chinese travelers come mass back January 2019 spread COVID States. People need understand measures taken stop spread viruses. It’s extremely selfish knowingly sick, keep silence board transportation around world spread diseases.  ya’ll  anti-vax sentiment - exists due medical abuse. SA people subject unethical medical experimentation numerous occasions. willing take medication (think antiretrovirals) withheld large pharmaceutical companies, justified actual Senate hearings - millions allowed die - logic like ""they can't read clocks can't even take meds properly"". 

Medical mistrust rampant reason. white American crunchy liberal conservative bullshit pretending subject medical malfeasance bored looking conspiracy fill nonsense void values stood. 

It's 'hey nana forcefully sterilized, lifesaving treatment withheld doctors could see baby would die AIDS - fuck doctors"" sentiment. 

And fair enough. grew doctors saving life. know SA's grew doctors condemning death see happens next. Yeah, like 1918 Flu got called Spanish Flu Spain country reporting accurately.  did. stated pre flight testing. Asymptomatic. doesn’t mean vaccines don’t work. Maybe think fear mongering making wild accusations.   *none  mutate something deadly line One things normal. Stop trying make be. say complete total failure? comparing NZ Alabama moot. Geographical aspect aside, population density, culture, people different consider many variables even make comparison. think *Whole Nu World* song parodies. site even? first paragraph alone states things aren’t confirmed scientists government. Welp Trevor Bedford Twitter drop making Omicron look good. He’s one biggest experts too. Please Fools aren’t self aware. Read article! Smh absence evidence evidence absence.

It impact current vaccine-induced immunity certain extent, know extent. Hopefully much. Anyone know deaths 100% week week SA part backlogged data uploaded? 2 months boosted kids get 2nd shot Sunday. 2 3 weeks may actually work immunity family given point, basicly forever. Two things consider though:

1) Hong Kong, sure ones use. website says never know actually got vaccines. new varient everyone worried about? one vaccines may effective against? Canada also longest lockdowns world. Where’s proof that? one already exists/existed specific metric(s) dictate end pandemic? mean get new vaccine? th first thing noticed usually Boris chums always abit slow comes restricting flights almost immediate response, people work wondering know something wee don't, lockdown Christmas would actually pay attention shitshow last year? 1/1500 Johannesburg tested positive last 2 weeks. Assuming 1,000 daily travelers (???) time moderate level undertesting gives something like 10 infections US. Johannesburg rate spread continues 10-25x people South Africa could next two weeks. Bringing additional cases country would give exponential rate spread large boost (effectively doubling initial rate spread since imported infections would roughly match local ones absolute prevalence rose rate areas).

Agreed Thanksgiving. Vaccine help :/. whole lot people eat crow.   Omicron Persei 8 go again, round 3. upvote half comment downvote half? first tweet wrong? pre-Delta, course know happened next, there's difference wrong failing predict something inherently unpredictable.

The situation India pre-Delta quite stable. already 3K big deal unless got infants toddlers life. saying is, better protection vaccinated people contagious would super helpful could done. Sounds like evil James Bond organization Yep. One possibility.  feel like requiring hotel quarantine everyone coming US (regardless country, regardless US citizenship) something can't read intended misdirect discussion original comment. ask bad spread was. said sure spreading, was, went tangent.

So spreading. provided link tried create different narrative. mean you, covid spreading Jan-Mar deny reason. Honestly, prob best thing could happen. Here’s question - end Greek alphabet? NATO phonetic alphabet? Would solve lot ‘issues’…? Actually, CONFUSES INFURIATES ME!!  vaccines need 6 months testing, meaning new variant gets ravage world 6 months vaccine fully approved fight it? eight? Nice see people working huge fan Futurama :) Thanks, can't remember first heard it. think teacher high school said me.  Yes, virus fuzzyducking pain mule.  Assuming immunity beating Omicron actually works well future variants.  youtube.com/watch?v=lZuKiLHax00 variants different spike proteins, therefore coded different mRNA genetic codes, make mRNA vaccines using different codes? bodies would make NEW spike proteins immune systems would recognize protect us. want Delta booster, Omicron booster. make vaccine new code. Omicron, largest coronavirus, simply eat others?  might slow teensy bit

That's point, though. time, research, knowledge problems arise.  imparted immunity strains less severe, could good. get sentiment, rolling joke persists really comparable, there's huge difference preventative care healthy people treatment sick cancer patients. I'm vaccines 3 think similar chemotherapy. vote democratically forever advocate I'm pro mask indoors I, one, welcome new Covid overlords. Two questions: 1) people U.S. died COVID far year 2020? 2) Based many scientists saying new variant evading vaccine, would Wonder media governments ever going address obesity epidemic's role research published showing vaccines less effective obese obese individuals recover produce autoimmune antibodies neutralizing antibodies. Thanks reminding I’m actually getting paid verbally insulted whatnot, actually spend time elsewhere. hope contributed something useful someone. See ya :) wonder, stop wearing seatbelt, making sure breaks tires work car accident?

I know mean 'living life normal' ; mean getting vaccinated, boosted (when appropriate), wearing mask appropriate, otherwise 2019, sounds reasonable.

If mean never get another booster wear mask, go attend every indoor convention can, sound wise. Less. People US resist restrictions regardless Yea actually thinking measles. Got confused name English.  I’m mildly concerned getting life  Easter 2023 maybe ... Honestly, humanity good run   new variant probably town adding shit  I’m surprised optimism last 21 months boosted lot people too. get okay. 2 weeks Virus doesnt want kill. survive.
Its already hitting kids even many survive, need change there. Lol gotta love 'SOAR' caps. definitely right, IMO commenter mostly wrong. *tons* legal technicalities involved ""being annoying"" prosecuted crime (unless nobody calls police bothers press charges), really handful situations can't be. loud, harassment (depending exactly person doing), drunk public, refusing wear mask, etc., *all* lead charges -- often happen police often take far.  virus care whether care not. I'm still taking precautions. anti vaxxers. made choice. medical folks thinking mask avoid crowded places  Unfortunately think graphs show that. takes 4-6 weeks people die COVID. cases started exploding single week ago, it'll least month really know affects mortality rate. Totally agree, seen shit waiting room ER. 😩 can't imagine Never forget looking flight radar app first week lockdown Cali. like there’s way we’ll ever get past air travel never truly suspended. 40% reduction transmission better reduction transmission, I'd love see something along lines 80 90% reduction. I'm three generations aviation, sides, clearly idea talking about, thanks victim blaming people like mom ""shitty attitudes"" 

JFC boots must delicious  checking CNBC website they're kinda freaking this. time I'm writing this, Dow futures suddenly 400 points, Asian markets plunging, calling emergency meeting, flights Africa cancelled. 
 
Way early tell something serious, eventually turns nothingburger (like Mu variant). one thing sure - financial markets *spooked*.     Fine  inevitable outcome. shit keep mutating mutating mutates strain longer threat hosts. That, kill every possible host one left. UK never wanted us banned list start with. SA met remove us. It’s easy add us back pretend it’s cause variant scientists could sequence faster theirs.  shots help one variant outcompete entrepreneurial spirit Peppa Pig World? biggest thing fact virus care deadly is. fact, want benign possible host lives forever. 

If two versions virus, one ""wins"" nothing deadliness, everything transmissibility. mutations happening everywhere time, tend get less deadly time contagious versions winning time. 

I'm order deadly one win 2-3 times row come exponentially longer odds time. 

So doubt variant transmissible Delta others. deadly would complete coincidence, slightly less likely statistically. are? simple like though. need mRNA sequence, mRNA manufacturing tech, nanoparticle design manufacturing tech, packaging tech.

And parts chain need skill sanitation resources create run them. mention literally future immunology going forward, company would keen losing financial future.

Plus also need sanitary fill finish facilities package stuff actual use, supplies distribute, store, inject them.  ""Just thought out, pull back in""   Hey wanted say appreciated advice. went got tested, luckily came back negative got see family today. Hang wait what,, what’s nu? Dude grandmother hospital every nurse section wasn’t wearing mask properly.

Like get it, mask SUCKS labor intensive environment you’re willing risk patient safety that? Yes.  true half ""We"" thinking nothing ""I"" I'm gonna long. 

I've lost family friends due covid death believing science. point ones go ahead get get this. They've turned nightmare us.  Well fly spain/france, england.
Doubt know whete everybody id coming + ue restrictions yet what's Nu? almost certainly going better protection offered next 6 months.  virus understand democracy, pity. depends variant different previous ones.

If spike proteins previous variants, spike protein based vaccines (by injection proteins creating proteins cells) still effective.

If vastly different (which highly doubt) another months months long process R &amp; D, development, testing, approval, distribution, administration..etc. saying “it may spread much faster, since doesn’t ‘muscle’ much damage, might problem” (but time tell course) 
???   could done right things, h ot sounds Lillie did, viruses work ""I"", work ""we"".

If society right things individual actions mean far less. Nobody knows yet, anybody saying immune escape speculating based limited data. Lol  lot research come trust great deal. Judging came before, definitely safe bet USA wreaking havoc speak booster still good. Still better nothing. get next booster whenever well. key trying stay ahead  headlines exact ones came Delta first spreading. spreading scientists alarmed much infectious hospitals overflowing. 

And one shitton spike mutations might able evade vaccines. Fucking great. Time lose couple years life virus, guess.  think know answer Well... Shit. Right. flying make metal tube wings take land number pieces?  70s, 80s, 90s, early 2000s, pre covid, covid, post covid.

I hear covid time referencing time now.  far used 2015 2019. competing Delta, Pretoria South Africa Delta B.1.1.529 completely replaced Delta week two. easy track TaqPath due gene drop out. sequencing genetic analysis de Oliveria’s team found B.1.1.529 variant responsible 77 virus samples analysed Gauteng, collected 12 20 November. Analysis hundreds samples ""you""

Pants bother me, yet still wear it'd otherwise bother others.
Immagine someone's life os stake. (Just saying immunocompromised)
Stop selfish, let us get back life.

This like complaining seatbelts, endangers others rather you.  juncture, think it’s fairly accurate say well truly fucked That's recipe overflowing hospitals. article literally reads 100, well 1000, yea, spiked True. Still thought ironic. Many people taking taking veterinary drugs get hands without prescription. Many likely perceive closer horse fish regard medicine take horse land mammal packaged version. Plus, know ventilation improved school building walk in. Pure hope? viruses mutations. Mutations increase viruses allowed spread throughout population. viruses highly transmissible deadly. viruses highly deadly transmissible. Rabies varicella (chickenpox) example relatively stable viruses don’t lot mutations. common cold collective family viruses high mutation that’s one reason there’s vaccine common cold. flu mutates good bit pretty good grasp vaccines effective except rare cases. Southern northern hemisphere reversed seasons northern hemisphere they’ll study flu season build vaccines winter northern hemisphere Vice versa Yes, twenty seventh time I've told that. surprised variant least partially responsible current COVID wave Europe. else cases shot up? Even point lowered restrictions, spike like this. Talk cheap. it. sucks knowing many people dying preventable diseases they're ignorant take care themselves. one different Baba O’Riley don’t really trust name anything.  afaik, major medical institutions saying lower teens least risk, children five especially children two higher risk teens (12-14, iirc least likely severe symptoms).

*edit* perhaps nowhere near 50 year old underlying health issues, high enough parents rightly wary wanting vaccine kids.  Man, Nu season already wake dead? Probably we're slow fuck Yes has. Libraries, public health care, postal service... socialism never fully implemented requires healthy cooperation rather prevailing corruption world over. we're sure dangerous certainly seems spread much faster anything we've seen before. make good points, I'll keep mind.

I've seen tweet linked people saying person worked Moderna vax, true? so, that's comforting hear coming them. Vaccine fixed anything, decreases probity hospitalization also may  can’t overstate much news destroyed mental health. genuinely hope anymore. I’m tired living constant state dread feeling like I’m living borrowed time.   Surprised one mentioned it, thought already shared banned lists? like official “master document” capacity. wonder efforts going artificially generate mutation.  looked earlier today, median 14 days fatal cases. seeing 4-6 weeks? I'm Nu here, missed? stopped watching movies franchise part 2. writers need use new elements now. sure link downvoted, lot information. bout opening patents? big pharma grubby fingers enough piggy banks?

open patents, let third world countries manufacture generic ones, get kids vaccinated. seems simple me, guess i'm simple kinda guy. 30+ mutations spike protein alone. could call “The Last Ship”  spend trillion stimulus unemployment every lockdown. break billion make vaccine could save hundreds thousands? lack urgency consistent disastrous response every major event throughout pandemic. 2020: 2 Electric boogaloo  vaccines here

Assuming vaccines work new variants. I'm fairly well aware happened natives pilgrims spending first years North America. call ignorance bliss situation. Moreso I've grown ""I hate everything"" teenage phase come realize things evolve point Thanksgiving convenient time everyone get together year spend time together catch up. Life easier happier take life less seriously savor time have. wanna call robot that's fine, seem quite combative angry everyone thread though i'd recommend looking really best mental outlook way upset everything actually good way live life. entire pandemic would less worse world taken care poor   article two paragraphs -  
'Coronavirus - known officially Sars-CoV-2 - would reproduction number three action taken stop spreading.' Speculating based article: “The variant also 30 mutations - twice many Delta variant - mutations likely evade immune response generated prior infection vaccination.”

I get you’re saying though. Hopefully vaccine least still somewhat effective. Perhaps chance variant less lethal. wait see. 🙏  could one turns common cold. Come know. socialization,

We seeing hugely negative effects protracted lockdowns everything crime, substance abuse, anti-social behavior.

Quite frankly, wrong. 

The answer lockdowns years come COVID19 going anywhere short term. answer creating initiatives reduce risk living relatively normal lives. difference though Delta came out, nobody really concerned seen massive mutation yet nobody knew do. time, everybody acting abundance caution. There's nothing know know right now. Nobody's keeping secrets. know seems spreading South Africa, know mutation profile points vaccine evasiveness THEORY. It'll little bit til proper data comes out.

[Not every scientist/person know shitting pants  UK Israel already put travel restrictions, done now. Anybody going wake US government officials get travel ban? following this? care? Yup.. wanna cancel subscription! Someone needs plant idea Q 
Anon stream. Delta two mutations everywhere.

The Tanzania variant 8 mutations nowhere seen. 

Please dont mistake think mutations equals evasion higher transmissability Politics Ok…. finally gonna let thing burn gonna keep pretending like control it?  could always choose get actual infection get effects Even many people trust science still can't get head around best courses action. wife still insists sanitizer every store despite aware low concern covid surfaces is.

Sanitizer visible thing people put covid prevention plans makes people feel better everything despite much. Filters seen alleviate anyones fears.    that, time know strain severe enough take seriously already spread around bunch likely country anyway.

You can't prevent entering suddenly stopping international travel, would international travel stopped even knew problem existed. better dark things, sure. try understand things do? That’s beings higher thinking capacity. Ignorance bliss all. It’s nice humans imparted bit wisdom trash robots. probably government mandated well. new South African variant 30 mutations spike protein alone  Man feel like difference variant disparity response. Scientists seem like they're shitting right places already shutting flights. Right? seems like fool's errand try prevent getting country. It'll worldwide couple months probably. completely agree, don’t credentials all. Mine lie realm media, I’m saying there’s enough information new strain induce panic enough know whether panic reasonable justified.  long think it'll take us know extent vaccines work Nu variant? IIRC Delta long, feel like variant gotten attention Delta beginning. Lol people aren’t picking sarcasm. March 2020 declares pandemic 

January 2021 America vaccinating 1 million people day 

That gosh darn capitalism developing, manufacturing distributing vaccine less year Already homie. Tons zombies neighborhood cares get sick something else covid, mean covid. There's like millions viruses bacteria, lot make sick. mean really concerned go get tested. Feel like that's fairly obvious, lot post-covid brain would eat crayons told would make feel better.  Yep, plus scarier covid guess less hesitancy less disinformation/propaganda... see happening unfortunately. They're also exact headlines came Lambda Mu thing. Unlike socialism rip roaring success everywhere it’s tried.

Oh, wait… Get monthly subscription box I'll inject thing myself. COV-1 pathogenic showed symptoms much quicker. able contained result. theory virus also mutation/deletion made ultimately turn itself, never proven.... evidence Japan stupidly garbage numbers. writers show assholes. This! 

This reason Ebola world. highly contagious direct contact (not airborne thank goodness). becomes deadly fast, victims cannot (unknowingly ofcause) spread others. Less spreadability means less overall deaths mutations.

All COVID variants airborne delta delta+ variants particular extremely contagious fatal Ebola. (Deltas however deadly contagious alpha.) populace still go school, work, grocery shop infected spread around atleast become weak (or get better guess).

So yes, new variant could contagious delta/ delta+ maybe so. spreadable, cannot fatal. fatal means populace die faster spread it.  hope 1.5 year old study we've hearing forever. Keep mind they're targeted testing they're specifically looking variant patients. Thank everything do. ordinary person feel like can't go surges know easy compared medical personnel. Season 3 Still late. People travel every day two. already everywhere maybe dominate yet. truly emergency, they'd stop travel right now, tomorrow. people wake dead. Schedule premature celebration victory. Followed friendly welcome South Africa variant… fear good chance right. time identifying variant exists, might late, already escaped containment. maybe not. even know variant dangerous, disappear like Mu variant did. locking hard fast least gives world chance reducing spread turn Delta-killer. Got mine week knocked good, still feeling effects. can’t get making regular thing 😬 Cool. Here’s hoping best! Tabloids report?  pandemic ever lasted indefinitely  Feel free add thoughts.... decide it’s move others noted, certain types viruses prone mutation, like flu. also issue contagious virus is, contagious also likely mutate. virus also novel human virus, makes even likely mutate evolves effective humans. strong evidence happening simultaneous identical mutations across different variants different geographic regions. Pretty much happened SARS I'm mistaken... Yeah, goddamn antivaxers fucked us measles again. look smallpox, k saw documentary, fucking amazing did. took like decade teams chasing every single case. leave. Society right suffering.  Probably they're take hot garbage. parents place they're sort careful extremely, can't therapy there, went back place therapy, figure might well go gym maybe even dance class since housemate works daycare gives takes multiple dance classes. I've last year, I'm vaccinated, I'm going crazy I'm position avoid it.  That's true pursuing covid zero strategy. world now, make sense anymore.    !remindme 10 days takes less week change vaccine new variant. testing unleashing population. MRNA vaccines basically magic now. longer goes understand point antivaxxers trying make. tiring  Thanks people proposing complete ban international travel discouraging unnecessary travel imposing quarantine measures already proven effective strategies pandemic controlling spread.  vaccine ineffective yes adapted, back square one everyone needing get shots again. would set us back least what, year? Odds low, possibility there. Sorry today then. Even tho root Bears. R0 Delta vaccinated people 1. would substantially spread 100% vaccinated environment, even - 90% one. people healthy they’re dead. POV, another Wednesday… know feeling.  I’m worried  referring adaptability them. It’s pretty clear new variant causes trouble, it’s going take much time get adjusted vaccines public. it’s looking like it’s going evade vaccines, boosters pushed populace.

Bro. I've lived two years house got vaccine booster soon available. I'm shit anymore. 

These idiots treated like nothing longer gonna affect life. 

I'll still wear mask take precautions I'm living life. sorry, socially distancing fully vax’d people, fully vax’d person? idk say point - what’s end point here? I’m li still wear mask public even though I’m fully vaccinated. got back. Thank everything didn’t know that, thanks.  They're keeping memory alive good old days people thought trolls boring. like historical reenactment pillocks. Source? here. remember everyone around scoffing worries. “It never come US!” 🙄 CEOS probably never experience actually wrath customers. Ok let’s see links Thanksgiving *first* holiday event US health officials FINALLY acknowledged rapid testing day meeting effective keeping infectious levels virus holiday gathering, even fail detect 3 dead viral particles nose?

It's good finally get it, wtf? arent failures. 90% new infections unvaccinated. math clear, 40% population responsible 90% cases. much opinion bits info consider pertinent situation full panic mode ensues masses.... Germany app offline logs high risk contacts automatically infected, post anonymously, too, people download list warned. collectively make everyone get vaccinated

A hypothetical way achieve via transmittable (aka, contagious) technology ready used fight covid-19. But.. future pandemic deadly virus easily moves people wild life, transmittable vaccine may solution vaccine people animals.

It is, course, full ethical dilemmes. Though, moment, technical hurdles really deploy bigger issue. genie bottle though -- takes one rogue lab government supported lab release something wild. Covid already airborne. Unfortunately vaccine game looks like every man itself, countries inevitably get left behind again.  Good ol capitalism failing world every step   Yep. I’m 3x vaccinated. I’ll continue go concerts, bars, travel. I’m politically left leaning supported restrictions vaccines. people know irl thought process.

Where know how?  variant evades vaccine good night, adapt vaccine.

People acting like sky falling not. No! began wishing fights break sports! seeing that? I'm sorry loss. Ditto. people agree really outside reddit. South Africa also highest HIV rate world 20% population. It’s surprising 20% immune compromised became Covid variants factory. Even get lucky time, won’t guarantee next variant same. 4? 5? I've lost count tired. discovered couple weeks ago. takes people start dying it. It’s soon know yet. restrictions helped delay (not prevent) infection hospitals stayed capacity time develop treatments vaccines. Unless new variant evades existing vaccines (which established) point restrictions. would delay ultimate amount people getting infected. evading vaccines I’d argue country level travel bans would among least effective ways slow (versus fine grained pervasive approaches). explain benefitted it? I’m necessarily disagreeing, don’t understand how. argument travel restrictions aren’t meaningfully cutting number infections ultimately occur, get downsides without hypothetical upsides. actually useful though? spread regardless. Sure might buy time, talking weeks months most. seem worth wider costs border-wide lockdown likelihood harmful significant. gonna get name ""Nu"". 

So I. mean lines far Nu overtaking Delta altogether like Delta wild strain. Ahh may I'm getting downvoted oblivion lol. Thanks info. know canadian pay $500 personally sure would charge government. definitely get price break vaccines example. That's odd Israel data India data directly contradicts   risk like 0.00001%. Australia this. many takes close borders. Also seeing different news agencies report nice.  Tell parents 100% responsible anything happens grandparents.  Well yes. friends friends use anecdotes support claims, downvoted. Reddit, Facebook. ""I want get MR. RONAS WILD RIDE."" Canada places limits price drugs. Pharmaceutical companies can’t charge whatever want there.  Get booster, even Pfizer. average brings protection back 80 90% percentile, age likly higher.

I highly doubt see varent compete booster, least right away. Sure. Except aren’t many cases really outcompeting anything?  seriously asking people would want effective version vaccine? 2022 aka 2020 aka 2020 2 - Electric Boogaloo We're going lockdowns all. that's going happen hospitals overflow patients, we'll hear dire things are, continue nothing. pandemic essentially eyes states states including mine, governors stripped power anything one party cannot speak due bots moderation here. prevents variant present simultaneously Delta spreading successfully despite efforts stop it. many coronaviruses living side side even Covid-19.   Yeah let's give unfair advantages rich. think statement also fair. think higher viral load truly infectious would indicate that. PCR always accurate tool confirm notion. Reuters covered brief meeting really nonsense, actually good idea technology thing. Alright, thank you, makes feel better sure Pfizer tend know mrna vaccines. eligible booster country get one.   Thanks. I'm 30 really think getting booster far. 
Here boosters available anyone interested, Pfizer, many confusing information mixing vaccines :/ live Cochise County. feel people wear masks. I’d say maybe 1 50 observation. Several coworkers vaccinated work vaccine. 

 I’m vaccinated wear mask public, get regular dirty looks. No, right, 'fit' enough.... Told yall, pandemic next 10 years. 8 years go. I'm guessing husband die another country you. Mine did. I'm pretty glad able get back home get specialist cleaners arranged clean biohazard, bet neighbours smell definitely lingers. Plus kind seemed like preserving dignity get taken care soon humanely possible. can't even imagine much awful would able come back soon humanly possible. Anything possible, extremely unlikely variant completely evades immunity (from vaccines previous infection). 
Even did, much better treatments, much knowledge, definitely much better than, say, March/April 2020. 100% population vaccinated gun point... blame Covid still spreading?   doomsday freakouts reddit actually help? Please explain  **Finally** someone overreacting rational whole situation! Thank you! odds dying Covid 2 1 million 18 person, odds getting severe illness little bit higher. *personally* don’t need lot luck unless going be. it’s bureaucracy. bureaucracy takes time. See, concussion bad shit brain. Hello, 2nd dose AZ. I've getting random feelings nausea. severe nausea, kinda mild. Sort like a, I'm recovering fever type nausea. 
 
Not affects daily life, like unpleasant. 
 
Is normal? almost certainly enough recorded cases get accurate r value especially given countries currently spreading advanced medical infrastructure. education, etc

Right, ""education, etc"" supposed cover various cases. wanted point vaccine hoarding really changed position we're in.  someone could warned could taken preventive measures, like simple cloth mask, free vaccine. Unfortunately alone definitely feel way Even scientist worked vaccine?  isn’t nearly enough data yet variant say much anything it, let alone make sweeping conclusions you’re already drawing. 

“Escapes vaccines”

“Stronger delta”

“Impossible stop”

“We protection this”

“Every healthcare system collapse quickly”

None claims substantiated point time. Experts learn variant coming days weeks, we’ll able make assessments it. then, comment hysteria. get zombie creating drug?

/s….mostly.  vaccinated two doses astrazeneca. one days study Pfizer Moderna? protected severe disease, even 50. Severe breakthrough infections vastly represented people 50.

Does country allow booster? go get one. far know. main problem may feel sick, could make traveling miserable (for ;) Well happens vaccinate Africa...   Wouldn’t mutation die almost instantly though? Doesnt really work job, jobs people close you, affected. partner factual ban working either jobs almost 2 years now, showbiz tourism. mom doctor, working (among things) Covid patients.

Not everyone ignorant purpose would ever listen government officials. Listen virologists. We're fifth  Hey, one sticking horse paste enthusiasts  point we're hoping treatment rather prevention i.e pill reduce corona common cold rather prevention vaccination alone.  Lol. You’re unbearably naive. case report says asymptomatic date symptom onset.  Though wonder (in leu better name) South African variant hasn’t driving huge spikes. Influenza since 1918 really grow stable, adult form; sars-cov-2 young still evolving whatever state end spreading widely possible. balanced state may end lower transmissibility, highly transmissible viruses tend actively combated humans.

Imagine Covid R value 1.3. Nobody would wearing masks, we’d accept possibility getting like flu (which kills 35k/yr US). 

Until get close point though, transmissible variant means growth variant short term, probably expect become contagious medium term.  yea 2025 drastically diiferent world 2019 thing transform human civilisation  I'm vaccinated Sinovac (two doses). worried? ""dominant"" relative, anything total amount cases *cough hack cough*  live US. one locking anything US. completely table.  mention human consequences. husband found dead home Friday evening. international couple begun program another country aim joining two weeks. got news, could get home fast enough (and good thing neighbours dead body stench lingers proliferates get specialist cleaners in). shudder think would happened happened allowed country due closed borders something. pains realize must happened least people. time new variant S. Africa
too!

these mutations look to, course, contagious possibly also defeating immunity. 


It's well beyond time everyone PROPERLY wear mask; LITERALLY least effort, responsible, so-easy-a-dunce-can-do-it contribution ending nightmare.

#DUH case South Africa. There's enough vaccines facilities administer them. People take them. scientist worked Moderna vax. data bloom labs study molecular evolution proteins viruses Great..Im start living like amish.  $$$ Bruh, realize ""a normal life"" entailed mere 100 years ago? easy af even pandemic. tired this. hell. pretty well protected booster. SA 21% vax.... literally read Africa somehow getting low case numbers deaths?  know dumb stoner talk could work harmless version covid-19 produced immune response re-activated effectively future exposures covid variants. Otherwise sprayed everyone virus reason whatsoever could possibly mutate god-knows-what.

In words, no, smarter every health official expert planet. type result varies region region based medical systems, behavior locals, available resources, etc. need time that's known. thank thinking us, news strain makes want throw up. know much death, dying, suffocating, hysterical family members facetime take. What’s mutation threshold variant qualify name, COVID-21? ""stable genius"" said something along lines. I'd specific, want get comment deleted. Oregon county &lt;38%  add this, South African particular huge amounts genetic sequencing. many variants classified 'from there.' wheres source covid low?? funny, remember months ago people justifying Africa prioritised vaccines supposed 'low' cases deaths. Except conveniently forgetting many developing countries lack necessary infrastructure accurately mass test Africa huge fucking place 1 billion people. news comes everyone freaking out. seeing treatments come mostly kids suffer authorities put emphasis them. kids got vaccinated back September thought (before FDA BS extention) think kindergarteners would controlled tightly? there's mandate people regardless 0f age effectively stop caring. school could mandate vaccines school year daughter could enter new year normal school environment. stands, there's really better way protect know covid kids long term. know long covid people recovered fully death option. It’s you, it’s anybody might need hospital!  Ahhh see. Man, sucks message boards, eh? Harder convey mean, mindset. apologies misinterpreting words. This. Far many unknowns variant go blind panic.  Ok. accept risk. We've heard things latest super duper extra dangerous variant. used believe jammed head nothing bunch media click-bait. Get vaccine everything fine.  first grade teacher second this. first started never thought we’d three school years later. Good. Gotta rein in. It’s getting hand fourth point, it’s already made HK Australia New Zealand literal islands. offload ships without people interacting. One countries world situation, even that's enough. Delta leaked anyway.

It's like keep society closed perpetuity. vaccines here. impossible close everything forever. 

I'm temporary restrictions hold holiday spike, clear world interconnected keep virus out, particular newer much virulent strains like delta.  Given little known - anything possible. Maybe lets us grow tails! Covid 4, it’ll blow tits off! Yes, suppose that’s silver lining here.

“Have heard Nu variant?” 

“Yeah, heard there’s new variant. know they’re calling it?”.

“The Nu variant.”

“I know it’s new variant, heard you. meant know they’ve given one Greek letter names yet?”

“Nu.”

“Huh?” retort study? anecdote someone getting covid twice? study says they're rare, impossible. *Waves* Super late post opinion we’re hearing it’s already here.  Fair. Pessimist optimist. Oh guess comment literally irrelevant lol... OK then? Thanks?   What's rerun? inject youself testosterone cured.  probably meant universal flu ""believe"" anything honestly. data leans man made, that's say that.  would likely mutate massively evade antivirals. Merck one developed flu give decent idea much leeway (a whole lot). Agreed. boosters might even enough really hone antibodies combat whatever variant arrises without completely new 'strain' COV-3 emerging. can't imagine getting much worse Delta honestly. Super efficient regard spread. vaccines still job early booster data encouraging... also consider Africa many unvaccinated countries  anti vaxxers......  really think skip Nu. would needlessly confusing discussing future variants, i.e. news anchor talking ""new variant"" ""Nu variant""? know they've already burned half greek alphabet, find something else use run out. Africa huge place may chance. know mutations occur people treated w/ immune suppressants heard suspect one may mutated untreated AIDS patient. definitely parts Africa still struggling w/ HIV infections maybe opportunity knocks. News sources aren’t talking like used to. doubt even lockdown would happen Australia, Delta. That’s contagion started outpacing contact tracing isolation. Yes. Spanish flu began 1917 waves 1922, though decreasing severity fall/winter 1918. remains seen fall/winter wave 2020 worst Covid. seen research saying vaccine taken received transplant. I'm fact, research seen shown transplant recipients absolutely vaccinated. seem upset. Stay r/coronavirus.

Literally doomiest subreddit. We'll add more. Let's see less 120 000 end year. good news individuals good news medical systems . Instructions unclear infected self worms. I’m it. add 10 year bo fly list. Make drive across country.  good genetic sequencing, first discover (Japan found Gamma variant, Brazil new mutation alpha already widespread country) But.... effective version, that?   USA, labor shortages. shortage slave labor content work like slaves slave wages. point comparison total 8,355 unvaccinated individuals age 60 ended hospital COVID-19 time-period 1,722 required treatment ICU.

1722 ICU 60 unvaccinated last year vs 9 vaccinated. Keep mind everyone unvaccinated choice. Widespread vaccination showed late spring summer. is, fair. chances getting sick outside astronomical. people fucking morons, can't trust anything right. works social pressure. morons feel like wear mask everywhere, better chance keep needed too, since keeping less hassle too. Yes do, actually. Australia New Zealand done really well covid, large part due strict travel bans there. Australia New Zealand opening borders again, covid cases creeping quickly. Another contributing factor would two countries isolated geographically rest world. Even so, I’d say travel restrictions certainly limit spread virus. Lots places dodged didn't. tired flight delayed people think know law think please  chances ingected denier getting board high may well call U.S.S Plagueship   theres one known variant US thats Delta  Well, try put shoes someone 20s 30s experiencing drastic decline cognitive physical ability. couple months go noticeable improvement, extremely difficult wonder rest life look like. doctors keep saying see anything wrong tests imply maybe head help things one bit. variants diseases start countries. Block borders. Moon, maybe  sakes really hope listen alarm assume worst.. really better, lot problems accurate reporting? would March 2020 locked down?

With completely collapsed healthcare system.

I’m getting mine 7. Dont blast get earlier? “Ivermectin doesn’t treat covid,” Dr Bitterman wrote. “It treats parasites (shocker) kill people get steroids treat covid.” already late.  True, novel vaccines prior vaccines invented regularly killed humans. That's science fact! No, not.  actually possible new variant render current batch vaccines (especially you’ve recently boosted) completely worthless?

Yeah I've waiting since April 2020 still happened yet. right take literal luck pandemic end. It’s insane acting like COVID Black Plague. vast majority population die COVID, millions deaths billions people earth. When's Moderna FDA approval date? Moderna authorized, approved. Hey dude I'm enjoying life wanna label mindless follower it. would life better didn't? may case you’re from, assure highly vaccinated places outside US hit huge waves vaccine breakthrough cases. hospital disproportionately unvaxxed, numbers wise vaxxed contributing around half severe cases. 

That’s areas successfully sheltered elderly pre-vaccine rollout, also got jabbed early facing Delta waning immunity. I’m writing Singapore, 94% eligible teens adults vaccinated. We’re better due booster uptake, ICU crisis month ago. Totally agree! I’m done giving crap. part, everyone else well. feel like it’s never ending Sage British Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies, govt body scientific research covid.

I tell paper pertinent information, research found ukgov website. Good trash robot. Moderna too. vaccines mRNA based.  Already detected Botswana Hong Kong.

Here comes.  That's 100 days get trials. trials, manufacturing.  much longer. Plus....they using manufacturing capacity make existing vaccines....if turn ship take time.  Terrible news live with? Would lockdowns pointless happen  you’re unvaccinated, we’re done. Period. know infectious is. Cool jets. Highly effective death severe illness, infection. great except covid already causing documented long term effects aka long hauler. People thought chicken pox harmless pox young people discovered lingers body decades inflicts shingles later life. Moderna wrong that. MRNA vaccine initially sold scientists one new vaccines could developed variants. Nobody said goalposts would shifted economically profitable specious standard would shift ""you probably die, ignore potential consequences novel disease"" New information coming light. far pandemic, exactly dodging it, Africa better expected many places areas seeing rather quick upswing new variant. Let's see learn moving forward. flu virus mutates _a lot_. one reasons every year different vaccine, sometimes another different vaccine mix southern northern emisphere. study measured infections detected surgery surgeon either wore mask wear mask. Traditions fun wired human brains enjoy. Lighten up. collapse health system. Severe relative Delta though? similar variant Delta replacing Delta   Spending effort one doesn’t detract others. buys time. Canada cheap prescription drugs.

First half 2022 could late June, feels like eternity away. article said “early new year” “at beginning next year.” Here’s hoping! people won’t take damn injection reasons whereas low virulence high infectiousness virus doesn’t give shit whether consent not. evades immune response deadly well. saying Covid flu? Travel restrictions never pointless pandemic, newer strains pop spread time. think politically uk wants protect Christmas. Huge chunks UK lockdown last Christmas compared rest world due delta, resulted significant moral hit. 

The uk significant genome sequencing hope track new covid variant sooner inside borders knows it’d currently longer delayed for, longer internal lockdown occur. Hopefully current vaccine deployed needed high risk groups (for example Pfizer AZ patients etc) surgery infection airborne respiratory disease quite thing. Bullshit. may late isolate places, still keep spreading quickly. 

We stop first person getting US. might stop 80-90 first 100. buy us month time research decide best measures be. promptly ignored 30 States anyways. Cases increasing Italy, opinion (am Italian), likely restrictions place January (such outdoors masking, curfew, large events). think full lockdown unlikely, new variant could change Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  friend mine works hospital covid ward. 39 year old, double vaxxed male weighing 170 lbs died last week. complications. death reported news articles. optimal vaccine currently killing vaccinated people. get it, get it, don't, don't. die, die.

Probably not, health regulators thought process quicker market release possibilities formula slightly changed, wouldnt need full 3 step trials, early days delta thoughts adjusted boosters. Im sure likely scenario complete uselessness basic immunisation though. isnt much data new variant, we'll sit one now. Currently risk lot higher get infected (huge group of) unvaccinated elderly missing boosters.   think pretty level headed way respond know more. mine. They're forcing vaccine everyone works them, U.S., would fine eyes force us work coworker get roommates get it. tell us coworker want everyone get vaccine. bunch hypocritical BS  we're talking virus R0 9 10 potentially, maybe even higher.

My question is, Covid mutate aggressively transmissible strains often diseases flu colds remain relatively same. say need spend federal money going unruly passengers. give airlines authority heavily fine passengers go line put black lists shared airlines, Mother Fackers learn hard way. right thing. That’s biggest lie government told you. “right” thing change go gather data  took 4 months produce Biontech/Pfizer vaccine back day, rest due testing process. may could partially waived time, depends regulators.     DARE think rationally!  proved years ago surgical masks actually make difference infections surgical  needs reform front making people absorb real costs flying non-flyers subsidize them. Corporations cover business costs, government. It’s also called sarcasm. going away anytime soon  Fuck shit. humans failed again. Let's see cause another bleak wave like Delta did. people simply take vaccines mask up? can't vaccinated people wait little longer? know tiring use masks time, much approve masking mandates I'm sick them, know masks still crucial stop thing.

I want sound pessimist, two years I've come terms thing never end. I've got accept life homestuck working home many idiots taken part since beginning. variant US right now? 😂 ""defeated"" implement many strict measures place original wave made many careless mistakes gave many shoulder shrugs account vaccines. borrow phrase usually used side argument: time people learned live them.  probably depend virulent is. 

Best case scenario reason, it’s less virulent.  then, would wait long first vaccine? Another day another variant…  doomed. I'm ok that. type respiratory symtom get tested covid stay isolation test results come in. said trivial common cold contraindication vaccination. Sadly looks infectious potential immune escape. right this, it’s going way worse 2020. OMG please nightmare end.  way, government actually acted quick restrictions countries once! Yeah lot country didn’t get till fall 2020 really   Quick Google search vaguely correct keywords trick That’s understandable, think governance makes decision subject ire, health professionals making recommendations.

And it’s worth, I’m sure “excuse” right word government makes decision take safety measure. “Excuse” implies way benefit measures they’re waiting it. really don’t think there’s politician benefitting lockdowns - I’ve confused conspiracy crowd crowing throughout whole ordeal.  firmly pandemic phase. 
And travel restrictions make sense based Precautionary Principle. 
 
During initial spread phase new strains share cross-border cases among cases strain form significant share infection rate Rt - compounding effect. Rt also depends infection level positive feedback.  get many people calling shutting international travel. WORK! virus still find way leak country, matter time.  Even did, FDA CDC would slow walk lead months debate, waiting data see needed, barely approve limits, two months later, bed everyone take it. I'm 100%, know do, even controversial science perspective.... 30% country even understand science willing get cover prove sort political point.  mean... identified Tuesday. So, yet.  many post need read this? Considering daughter minor, highly likely Harder mean impossible. variants identified SA identified SA one countries testing variants? feel bad them, seems like get ton flack variants likely didnt even arise there. tons friends say travel restrictions around world heavily discriminate SA bc variants detected. delivery.  Sigh I'll save click-- ECMO. Nevada one hospital ECMO treatment center, Sunrise hospital Las Vegas. offer delivery...  still know evasive. may still see protection, specifically cells vaccines even fully protective.

The alarm sounding still somewhat contained regionally, best assume worst case scenario, actually missing ton data fully anticipate variant do.  Nice numbers see. Thanks Well smallpox around Facebook, hence problem face. government messaging terrible. Many people still think flimsy cloth mask KN94. Ventilation key. Covid airborne. airplanes still turning vents boarding process, save money. 

Schools workplaces better spending money HEPA filters improved ventilation. Instead, lot offices investing gallons gallons hand sanitizer disinfectant wipes like 2020 still. Cleaning surfaces great that's covids primary means transmission. 

Lots places still requesting proof vaccination PCR test. That's great, rapid test morning event better. PCR better diagnosing people, rapid antigen tests good catching infectious people. 

We've shit two years, knowledge vastly improved messaging not. see anywhere different, that's scientist's talking. That's media exaggeration.


The Hong Kong patients vaxxed asymptomatic. SA low vax rate there's data Nu variant impact vaxxed countries Well, know. babies don’t get vaccines next year. could right, though point reached another species, likely room tweak years settles more.

It mutation error correction flu unlikely ever start making multiple strains, hopefully limited variants (at least sub decade timeframe).  He's joking. know it’s severe/deadly delta? Sorry refunds government officials? country, Europe.  Mandates don’t shit make people feel good something. Really need fast track pill prevent death scale hospitals / create covid hospitals. Controlling cases longer option. flu? sky diving? going outside?

The flu years, weaker virus reach spread Covid currently having. always people sick dying flu, never point overflowing hospitals making health services collapse short periods time. conversation we've almost 2 years now, news anyone COVID serious harmful societies economies similar vaccines keep people hospital cases matter.

Another user somewhere made analogy perfect: see small fire, wait get bigger try put out. Sames cases. They're rising NOW, can't risk situation get control, became extremely hard deal later inevitably proportionally affect number hospitalizations deaths later on, even vaccines work. 15 daily deaths better 100 daily deaths worse. Portugal apocalyptic situation last Winter, one wants happen trust vaccines, better safe sorry. complain want measures harsh unnecessary get Winter low number vaccines keep people hospital get them?

They do. Massively. Last year, day (25/Nov), 3,251 people hospital + 517 ICU. Today, 691 hospital + 103 ICU. Deaths 71 last year, today 15. **Vaccines lastly unvaccinated causing issue apply restrictions them.

There barely unvaccinated people Portugal, point they're almost problem. vast majority unvaccinated people Portugal children 12 eligible vaccinated (that's change). They're also currently big part cases rising, together younger people returned normal social lives past months. sure, they're serious cases, are, obvious reasons, infecting entire classes whole families. spread inevitably reach older people health compromised, kept check.

The measures announced today still shadow had. Nothing really closing apart school, discos bars week January. Otherwise, mostly mandatory mask usage indoors, using vaccine certificates tests. countries need follow. Delta hell hospitals still packed dealing it. Imagine something even worse. IvERmeCtIn! Cool. made good call traveling holiday. fly headed back? goes friends.  pandemic phase COVID, endemic phase. would prudent gather information variant shutting borders, especially undoubtably already present many countries / continents. boat. Like destroyer. one it. happened best scientists boat working vaccine. 

That would cool. locked down, people would flip out.

Also, Hong Kong guys asymptomatic  No, people aren’t vaccinated today obviously don’t see carrot. Again, basic understanding human nature would made obvious. 

Thus carrot. governments rely “stick”. Aka force. Hong Kong guys asymptomatic Yeah, arguing me?
The problem isn’t doing. problem country’s hospitals overwhelmed. need medical attention, might available.  Literally, delta airlines passenger fly list American, I'm letting flights electricity, use candles. that's point. ACLU saying, take away someone's right fly putting fly list, try judge.

I'm alright permanently banning dangerous people flights, case heard court.

I used fly lot. woman flying funeral. stewardess curt, woman lost started crying. got bumped flight hold together.

This type situation someone could least judge hear case permabanned. It’s virus never ends Bruh essentially data suggest Nu outcompetes Delta vaccine. Yes dominating SA Delta already died down.

Furthermore, Hong Kong guys double vaxxed asymptomatic. Numbers without sources downvoted.

But, they're not.

Thanks bringing attention unsub. Novavax works pretty well variants IIRC. one saying it’s easy dude. It’s hard needs planned done.  made feel better felt like could live without judgment world would “normal” again. certainly wouldn’t feel way lived restrictive part country world Keep change filthy animal think get this, grandparents/forefathers got six years war, bombs, mass casualties happened, many may die, lot live. it, it, it. I'm expert, fact contracting measles disease gives near lifetime immunity, Covid natural immunity wanes fast proof enough unlikely we'll ever long term immunity it, whether via vaccine anything else (Israel already considering fourth dose now..). updated vaccine every variant we’d Ike 6 boosters now. needed one booster  Im honestly starting think covid form another come define entire decade. We're long past point able eradicate it, we're going dealing continuous mutations outbreaks least next 5 years. exhausting.  here. :( Better that, Redditor! mention last time Delta stop travel negotiating trade deal India. Whereas priority countries Southern Africa, (...)

Of course, still prioritize politics economical gain actually fighting whopping pandemic...  solution see make mRNA vaccine IP public costs/supply acceptable. Distributing shelf-stable Pfizer/Moderna areas without adequate refrigeration supply chains would good stopgap measure well    assure vast majority unruly pay fines lack means, simply switch airlines. 

Yes, surely rich person would never act like entitled dickhead plane! Gotta poors stinking joint again. Can't get rid them? took much longer develop measles vaccine taken develop coronavirus vaccines. see progress.

But truly impossible treat prevent coronavirus, remains dangerous now, wear masks long necessary.

Some people stated cannot stand wearing masks. one people.  No. neither driving car.

People deserve right judge hear case license gets suspended, like people deserve right apeal fly list judge.

I still agree ACLU. media calls horse dewormer people were/are taking veterinary version stuff get local farm supply store. is, stuff that's actually *marketed* horse dewormer, presumably vastly different dosage would prescribed human, likely carries big fat warning says ""for veterinary use only"".

If doctor prescribes ivermectin treat on-label condition parasitic infection, take it. want self-medicate something says ""not human use"" picture farm animal package, bloody take it. simple.

As mostly safe vast majority cases, crossing relatively quiet street without looking. even risk serious injury small, non-negligible, carries zero benefits. ""threatening"" ""tantrum.""

Google friend ([number ([number know comes implementation corporate no-fly list?

Maybe behave like civilized adult worry put fly list.  Yeah also gives worst version virus yet better chance spreading variants Source? can't anymore think problem kinds statements often followed enforced measures. live major city largely lockdown year. Every time see article like makes bit nervous officials hold excuse start implementing restrictions. may complete data yet, arguing position data. Yeah that's true, Covid mutate higher transmissibility flu remains relatively stable R0 1.3? well though, they're easily updated led believe.

These things basically sterilizing magic old variants alpha. delta arrived introduced level lowered efficacy. Protection infection changed 95% 80% something, even higher drop-off time.

Where new delta-targeted booster? still working vaccines designed last year mRNA promised rapid updating needed? potential theory might quite virulent can't replicate quite efficiently cells. way simplified. spike proteins somewhat different mutations have, doesn’t automatically mean ”no immunity”. case, don’t even know means lower immunity. lot mutations, it’s reasonable assume there’s risk lower immunity. really don’t know Safe say better err side caution comes covid. Well that's global economy toilet. know yet T/B-Cells mature time. Recent pre-prints (broken science moderated sub /r/COVID19) shown booster (3rd) shot and/or delay giving 2nd shot months leads better immune response (then response initial 2shots). 
 
We really need testing blood samples vs. ""nu"" variant. Including people post 3rd shot. hope immunity becomes generalized time goes (if rechallenged w/ booster) ""undo"" 1 shot

Taking face value, mean someone 3 shots (e.g. 2 initial shots + booster) they'll essentially protected 2 initial shots? come april covid gone? travel ban specific high-risk country. shut borders every country.

It also done early virus chance enter country. variant probably circulating weeks already spreading many countries. lots daily flights South Africa rest world.  pretend it’s cause variant scientists could sequence faster theirs.

The discovery mutation comes British scientists sequencing… 

Same thing happened Delta everyone closed borders U.K. even though British scientists said already everywhere.    Well don’t know think it. 
I want optimistic think delta plus one Peru beat delta escape immunity. think time British variant said Brazilian SA variant much worse! don’t know, hope delta wins battle (it’s strange stupid saying it)

On hand, they’re reacting pretty fast throwing really big words around. I’m panicking bit, gonna lie. it’s more
Infectious delta, brace yourself, shit already spreading.  feeling? talking about, wish symptoms scarier ""extreme bleeding,"". thankful is, general, extremely survivable, especially given benefits modern medicine. Agrees. done shit say, unvaccinated essentially electing die sufficient quantity reduce pool potential cases hence mutations.

That’s likely scary scenario, esp volume antivaxxers refusing accept efficacy vaccine, arguing, fact, vaccine actively harmful. think antivas idiots, that’s still *lot* potential deaths.   Drink CMV: new B 1.1.529 variant (current) vaccine evasive (responsibly) feared -- par ""undo"" 1 shot -- Pfizer/Moderna allowed (by governments) offer ""updated recipe"" booster without another round clinical trials ""right try"" basis. Isolated 2 years. Sick tired pandemic. Fuck shit royally would've originated elsewhere africa prioritized. Africa also lacks necessary infrastructure spread vaccination aswell, testing. absolutely surprise anyone [Tracker Except test positivity went 1% 30% 2 weeks. means over-detection. Maybe read articles all.  know evading vaccines yet. *possible* based mutations, there's definitive data proves evades immune response extent know.

EDIT: I'd also add Hong Kong case double vaxxed Pfizer is, yet, asymptomatic. good sign. one much worse, much greater concerning number mutations. still lack important information many times able safely use messenger RNA injections. So, also think need consider using vaccines, ones work types technology achieve broader immunity SARS-CoV-2.


So hum, mix match vaccine types? 
Could done. 
Find different part inject? That'd take much time. 
Yikes. They've testing, preliminary data came months ago (Sept iirc quarterly investor PDF). find significant benefit VOC specific boosters vs. original vaccine. original illicited 30+fold increase....so that's heard them. 
 
Point is, update ready quickly - they've proven that.  Florida won't. Governor let everyone die COVID-19 allows us take precautions all. fucked.

(come think it, variant probably already here; would way knowing)  lungs full scar tissue third former capacity left, gonna wreck months Typically infectivity virulence inversely related   News coming fast furious this. past hours, Dow Jones futures gone -400 -800 points; Austria closing flights certain south African countries; Italy. 
 
Going sleep now, wake 6 hours expect even crazier. [I saw image posted another Reddit Viruses wanna replicate left alone thing.  feel like I'm crazy fucking preacher street corner apocalypse movie screaming ""I warned you!""

But seriously, like others said: sequenced one country, likely already spreading around globe.  Fair. Posted comment literally picked last hours I’ve seen it’s posing question. :) thank though. idea voting threatening you.

I completely agree.

The protesters angry restrictions introduced fail see irony protest going effects require even restrictions.

And turned violent too... rumors bunch football/soccer hooligans showed riot...   fully vaccinated susceptible infection ?  Option 2 like buying new car dying car crash leaving dealership. one knows yet Screams Nu!!!!!!! always love seeing Austria comments big kid covid sub. are, course, correct. always good stay informed world events, beginning effect sometimes worth stepping back consuming less media. know easier said done curiosity gets better us, look mental first!  Merica moment mean worst case scenarios virus eventually integrates DNA Yes. Moderna already developed variant specific vaccines Beta &amp; Delta (named mRNA 1273.351 &amp; mRNA 1273.617). tested early data Beta specific vaccine original Wuhan based formula produced similar response booster. necessary. 
 
That said, yes, mRNA vaccines relatively easy ""update"" FDA already said require new trials approval (they'll approved rapidly similar annual flu vaccines).  People thought Pandemic over, including politicians. open things fast enough got fucked Delta regions lower vaccination rates. Wait couple weeks BOOM! bit irrelevant discussions comments Reddit much intellectually advanced. don’t know I’m talking about, go COVID news video YouTube go comments… it’s full anti vaxxers missing brain cells  seems really worrying. spread happening quickly. curiosity, long guys think it'll know sure whether variant escapes vaccine immune responses? take weeks definitively find Delta first came around?  Believe me, know. I’m saying response implying said Australia failed (I not) comparing one hardest hit countries benchmark non sequitur talking - Delta variant made Australia’s measures working less effective.    nothing vaccine supply poor countries, could avoided. takes 1 person create new variant, vaccinated people breed spread variants anyway.  God yes.   disheartening one first countries act fast cancel flights South Africa already detected it. Seems like there's way stay ahead variants infiltrate. saw another comment anyone know aware severe less? IIRC easily transmissible virus tends fatal? super base?   hate much love  we'd dont really know really don’t see need keep stressing it.

When aliens arrive what's left earth, find carved stone somewhere currently illegal reuse vaccine vials US manufacturers pushing Covid exemption. doubt happens however want avoid bacterial infections want PR nightmare comes that.

The big thing vials made specific glass type (for mRNA vaccines) called borosilicate glass. vial undergoes rapid cooling must able handle this. many vial manufacturers create this, already operating max capacity. mention reliant materials make vials steady supply. 

This might also issue areas vaccine production, especially around availability reagents such. lot moving pieces organize new vaccine, without year plan collect supplies.  America cant even vaccine mandate domestic air travel  I’m visiting South Africa moment US I’m stuck here. supposed fly home last week tested positive Covid (despite fully vaxxed). quarantine may able leave even test negative. Nice, 3 years. 😂 post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  1,000%. Everyone breaking point risk getting vaccinated person relatively low odds severe illness less worrisome effect fear, anxiety government restrictions mental health. concave dented surfaces become convex flip over! Fresh head pounding material. Based data have, variant out-competing others *far* faster Beta even Delta did. 

Oh, no...not *again*. I'll take either. waiting that's annoying. Covid 4: dead die good idea all. fully vaccinated provide negative test, reason allowed travel Southern Africa. Flight bans stop Wuhan original, stop Alpha, stop Delta. Nu contagious, stop either. met yet? get effective treatments pandemic end 2022 ever remember getting flu shot, I've booked appointment get one never week. work home roommates work regular workplaces flu shot recommended everyone year, I'm getting it. *sent srarepamphs iphone -33.432w 45.28n checked national memorial hospital Facebook coupons Google cash New Zealand literal islands.

So UK?  [low show it. boggle mind there's still debate effectiveness masks vaccination. 22,184 cases yesterday equal 431,000 US cases, Netherlands went past US total cases. Netherlands number 2 Western World total cases per capita(after Czechia)in countries 5 million people---Belgium soon pass US also  vaccines still work fine delta. Also, sh*t like this. profit vultures gross. Damn. supposed go South Africa March. Bummer it’s getting cancelled.  spiraling too. done 100% lockdown almost two years daughter high risk. Shes child, means kids TWO YEARS. finally getting second dose vaccine next week. none matters. finally saw light end tunnel. problem vaccine may straight work basically anymore. could give thousand shots Wuhan v.0 vaccine STILL protect you. variant, coming - Delta already big step direction. county 57% Republican. vaccine literally split directly party lines. thousand total cases South Africa two weeks since first sampled; clear individual cases would spread beyond yet. individual cases arrive take time randomly sampled time samples actually sequenced. UK sequences far largest percentage cases relatively quick turnaround time, I'd expect data first. would expect UKHSA release technical briefing VOC summary based analyzing Johannesburg data soon. one looks brutal. let Delta slip ragged us. Maybe time throw shutters hold data comes through.

And, honestly, everyone think every new development C19 used distraction? stupid distraction itself. either 'theyre using control us!' like there's controls months. 

NB: good Tory lavatory but, given interesting times live in, they've actually done badly. thought they'd fence poors throw old food wall. want clear, there's difference ""F mode"" say meeting basic human needs.

It's ""F mode"" want see family. ""F mode"" recognize importance person school. 

I feel like COVID19 becoming *political* scientific issue. completely reasonable understand real dangers COVID19, also understand real dangers protracted lockdowns restrictions. needs nuance ""Open everything without rules"" ""lock everything take every precautions"" differing opinion gross oversimplifications.  enough data make decision ofc Hence weasel words! Could blip, could trouble. Hell could pony.  weird different areas affected. Since pandemic started know 4 cases. Two co workers (who cousins live together), co worker's mom, nurse, one friend(who probably caught vaccination site...), cousin caught delta airport Texas. makes relieved could even six months. could hunker another six months suppose. point bunch virologists epidemiologists gather room decide it.

But realistically likely won’t happen unless there’s new symptoms disease pathways.

If HIV Ebola virus mutates huge amount it’s still called virus since gives disease. different strains/variants Sounds like live except people lost interest mitigation year ago seems like pandemic never end I’m sorry. don't. 

What cost Moderna create 1 dose? Spread &amp; similar virulence Delta then. You’re getting downvoted, I’d venture guess you’re right.  issues mate. good information could multiple infections time: weakens slightly other, symptoms overlap. symptoms sound serious lasting; possible I'd suggest calling asking doctor concerned.

Other typical healthy-people advice fighting infection stay hydrated plenty zinc vitamin c. **COURSE** doubt ICU nurse feeling way. Thank fuck blame saying this. US paying Moderna $15 $16.50 per dose, think that’s completely fair. Exactly. got boosters got back awesome trip Europe. see people saying “why even traveling?” Really? supposed put lives hold indefinitely. masked took precautions great time. Excellent write-up. graph shows strain take matter days convinced real deal pretty much instantly. Unlike ""vaccine resistant variants"" one extinct, appears outcompete delta. whole point mutations *zero correlation* severity.

So definition whole part discussion talking mild variant. mutations *changed* normal severity (that current variants have) mild severity would *incredibly strong* correlation.

So point is, current variants' normal severity, hospitals overwhelmed before. mutations made virus less severe made look different existing immunity (through vaccines natural immunity) protect us infection, we'd basically starting whole pandemic like early 2020 again. Spread always mean symptoms become worse deadly though. No. He’s making point, many pieces move coordinated fashion. responsibly cautious. got flu shot every year this. Imagine taking place Covid shots. two comparable, perspective shift. Future generation get Covid shots year instead Flu shots ( ). anything inherently bad this. appear reality we're heading to. Get vaccine, get boosters. Live life. issue we're still sold idea "" eradicating "" that's viruses work. definition even alive. Covid cruelest sense humor I'm Pfizer, think current vaccines work Delta. think MSNBC question something like, ""What get variant vaccine work against?"" answer essentially, retool 90 days get sample.  Yea, see ceasing mask wearing time soon.   moving accepting minute risk factor won’t impact you’re healthy. basically antibiotics, worm super infections instead bacterial ones. make sense.  
Terrible performance named today emergency meeting. 

UK, Israel, Taiwan begun restricting travelers countries surrounding South Africa.  ""red list type"" think need Hong Kong type restrictions even though 21 days quarantine overkill

I meant arrival restrictions leave home danger   future. Don’t worry Covid. You’re still alive. media always try make feel fear, clicks money. live Covid doesn’t exist (provided reasonably healthy)? True :)

I'm sure science find way get around (IF happens), cost time. time big factor crisis.  vast majority mutations worse, allows rare mutation works better. like virus mutated within bat populations able infect first human.   Start tattooing “bad Traveler” foreheads.  best bet overweight getting vitamin D.  absolutely rinsed media stopping flights India quick enough.

So time, anyway, can't fault easily.

It's politics theatre    Weirdo Moderna’s website says Phase 3 testing Beta Delta variant vaccines. don’t need government approval make new vaccines, government won’t hurry approve new ones existing ones work fine. Fuck. thought light end tunnel…😭 South Africa  read article? It’s speculation nearly year ago *partially* vaccinated could possibly spur mutation long period time. understand happening? always cherry pick something like run around spreading misinformation talking biggest pandemic lives? mess there. wish everyone else serious.  I'm tired...  Glad see England front foot change instead waiting problem later control. likely revealed politicization over. People want feel proactive statistically doubt we'll see impact. No, we'd multivalent/trivalent vaccine effective *every* currently circulating lineage current vaccines are. we'd able use half dosage get effect doses less side effects. trivalent (original+beta+delta) vaccine would include large number mutations seen Nu's spike. [2-valent much better Gamma would similarly better Nu (lower breakthrough rate) current vaccines.

We've run phase 1s universally agreement. we're continuing run slightly-larger phase 1-2s get safety data continuing give antigenetically ""narrow"" vaccines.

All say current vaccines ""work"". difference 80% immunity, 95%, 99% extremely large. likely happen everywhere map red. HIV perfect storm immunocompromise cook Covid variants.
  add Malta similar vac rate climate never dropped indoor masks, masks school kids 3+, vaccine certificates events (not dining though) allow entry vaccinated travellers (easier, island). 

It's currently better Portugal, possibly that. Cases rising time hospitalisations/deaths stayed low. 

Nobody complaining restrictions. People happy normal lives, lockdowns, normal access regular medical care, ability gather friends family... compare that, wearing mask big deal.  kind spread, that’s thing.  time anniversary lol Exactly remember last winter scientists calling dropping Ip vaccines get distributed ASAP otherwise exactly situation would happen. It’s almost like exactly thought would happen fact happening 🤦🤦🤦🤦🤦 work school relatively transparent filtration upgrades, cannot see know sure, bought portable HEPA air filter. visible one direct environment definitely gives sense control (be real imagined) out-of-control situation. say, right tangible measures impact people psychologically.  app exists tbh idk enough people using useful.

They

*more choking*

Tracking devices believe think become endemic seasonal, like flu.

I'm far past point believing COVID ever go away.

We chance collectively, dumb shits fucked up. not. [99.99% cases sequenced Germany samples first 2 weeks November bad. choose option 1 I'm sure anymore. Every time think things improving, something new pops sets us back. Every. Single. Fucking. Time.

I feel like I'm going insane future. future looks like dark abyss. neverending cycle stress anxiety I'm worried things never get better. People always say I'm luckier people who've died, what's point living living well? Stepping front train starting feel reasonable day. thought New Zealand even opening April? Probably pricey amass human sized dose buying kitten sized doses. ok cool. I'm going back Downton Abbey episode.

I ain't stressing shit more. call one South Africa

Some previous variants also 'came South Africa'. South Africa tests well shit - mean originated there. Unfortunately seems Britain already raising alarm UK Health Security Agency said B.1.1.529 variant contains spike protein differs dramatically one original coronavirus COVID-19 vaccines based significant variant encountered date urgent research underway learn transmissibility, severity, vaccine-susceptibility,"" UKHSA Chief Executive Jenny Harries said    Yes, good point. Maybe frantic takes many mutations Nu variant. 1890 pandemic killed 1/1500 world population suspected caused one currently circulating human coronaviruses. Whether Covid been/will end harmful hard comparison, tested deaths 1/1500 ballpark. Please no. Don’t give ideas idiotic base chew Alright, someone change channel, one keeps showing season diseases zombies, dying! ...^very ^depressing :( Canada  Quiet logic reason. 

Also anything effectively dodges immunity effective binding spike proteins.

These headlines making news cycle lot money they're stoked find something new shares. 

I'm worried stressed actually to. Waiting data decide brown pants it.  didn’t work thanksgiving dinner, i’m seeing first time 1:30 spike proteins different, mean much weaker, none existent immunity vaccine? This. think outside UK hard really understand hard hit us. Christmas people largely good spirits, started fade close big day. After... seemed even upbeat positive people far super low. know single person feeling kind low that. like whole country depressed.

The Gov would everything possible claim Christmas win... know general population largely wised acting fast fastest way enter lock downs. Legend  Imagine people plague 1300's must felt. husband nurses. rest society, feels like covid over. last months incredibly depressing, seeing many people going life like everything normal perspective, far it. Solidarity.  Compared Norway’s health system, US’s level third world country. one “developed” nation offer universal healthcare. Speaking experience - broad metric, overall financial market performance usually pretty good indicator whether worried something not. movers shakers *lot* money invested, position control many funds &amp; investment groups *lot* money moving around, access internal contacts within governments, pharma companies, NGOs (the general public) don't. Contacts may understand better, could explain, exactly big deal could be.

If they're getting nervous, I'm getting nervous. ban travel everywhere whatever you’re trying prevent gets here. say prevalent handful countries accept travelers countries people already spread virus initial countries though aren’t aware yet. That’s challenge something contagious there’s asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic spread - cutting it’s already spread beyond countries it’s known expected be. I’m sure. detected yet. usually ball detecting new variants Uk. 

It 99.99999% get here, maybe it’s actually yet. Would amazing true. 

Not convinced quarantine (probably strictly enforced managed) anything.  agree there's sort franticness think spurred part UK Israel closures given media plenty fodder. actual scientists doctors I'm seeing varying levels concern; worried, think watched closely.  Lockdown measures politically impossible posed risk pandemic regaining momentum.

When exactly lost momentum? Fucking hell new South Park movie hit right nose. talking you, they're talking health departments setting policies. means protection vaccines could weaker. Potentially much weaker. Ok always South Africa? fact I've heard two days one ever Lambda Mu, bode well Also rich countries world share vaccine poor countries world. recently warned us. getting third doses whilst others access. food clean water accept time actually care cause affects us. What’s interesting someone know recently received booster, somehow shingles latent virus activated got head. sure think Nah. thinking USS NATHAN JAMES. Wuhan variant, Alpha (British) variant, Delta variant.  Umm….can first one please? Followed UK immediately banning flights South Africa. 


IIRC, South Africa good testing, hence many variants discovered there.   Yeah don’t want I’m also realizing go much. Nowhere would put high risk. 

I hope engineer newer gen vaccines last lot longer. don’t many vaccines every 6 months… combine annual flu shot, hopefully less side effects, fine. Im 14 caught covid last december, fever friday went away saturday. Sunday brother breathing problems got tested positive got tested turns caught too. didnt bother first days throat started hurting voice 3-4 days. since even little cold fucks stay bed. throat became sooo sensitive chest too. im asking Covid ? They’ve also shown “escapey” mutants pretty handicapped infecting cells.

This thing limits. Even everyone vaccinated virus still still spread  Please no. face already flat flat surfaces home dents them.  going bars restaurants cinemas concerts decreases mental health UK opened travel though gave up, alleviate bit concern, rate transmittal death remain 1-2% rate.  one (B.1.1.529 variant) spreads FASTER. Holy shit, spreads faster!  Add fact lab results yet B.1.1.529 variant vaccines, okay mild panic. guess one burning question is: B1.1.529 variant already arrived US, UK, countries, transmissible vaccine-avoidant, data first cases countries? two weeks’ time? need say ""Donald Trump"" encapsulates described.    Time start stockpiling resources like medication etc maybe racist. barely afford rent bills. can't go work, might well homeless. gets bad, might die go work. I, like many others, large rock hard place. need work. talk many mutations still essentially identical virus. ancestral strain vaccines still generate antibodies T-cells boosting variant-specific vaccine boosts original antibody response, change (vaccinating H1N1 H1N1-naive persons tends boost H2N3 antibodies rather producing new H1N1 antibodies well, virus strains miles apart compared this). want boost, go get boost, got boost already protected possible, wait variant-specific vaccines. !remindme 90 days good bro, know over? /s South Africa huge amounts vaccines available immediate use country full anti-vaxx morons. I'll shocked even reach 50% vaccinated without mandate. Right, least semi decent human… totally get it. live south surrounded idiots, risk family members stay home socially distanced 🤷‍♀️ it’s exhausting. guess mean sane, halfway decent people (non- Q) together Well. Anecdotally, breakthrough infection got literally right 6 months mark, week planning getting booster, nearly kicked ass don’t agree. frantic feeling neither had, I’m going back check memory perfect almost 2 years posting COVID. headlines Lamba, Mu Delta could blurring together.  still think human behavior changes end covid HA! answers. Masks, improved ventilation, frequently testing. good chunk people can't bothered it. one wants spend money things like ventilation cogs report work regardless. 

The foundational problem getting people care mitigation. everyone F mode, numbers show it. “So far”  hope so, claims I’ve read B1.1.529 variant, spike protein completely different. We'll lovely party 2300 then, yay. spouse Thanksgiving alone second year row since getting breakthrough COVID infections. hope family feels better soon. else supposed clip toenails?!?  infrastructure built. cold chain literally didn’t exist point. does.  agree. sounds exactly like Delta. First reports tidal wave.   Yeah. like us Australia. Doesnt meant prepared borders open.   Saw tik tok pharmacist brought extra doses home cooler family BBQ, believe. pretty metal. Comments asking parties hahaha. community numbers 3x year ago heading Thanksgiving. 4th worst day cases ever week. 50% vaxxed, hanging around 8-12% positivity one following restrictions masking. winter worse, I'll shocked. Seems logical, but... immediately isolating country sure could act huge disincentive reporting future outbreaks concern. reached point health organizations deploy aggressive test &amp; trace action programs?  got reply 3 hours ago.

You edited comment 1 hour ago.

What gives? two years. Time upgrade covid21 new exciting features. We’re ‘losing’ spending money hire doctors nurses.

Medical staff burning leaving due *insufficient staffing levels*.

Insufficient staffing levels *choice* hospitals make avoid spending *money*

It’s completely manufactured crisis sacrifices scant precious medical personnel profits corporations businesses.

If US afford soldiers still occupying barracks countries, afford hire many nurses doctors takes completely prevent burnout overcrowded hospitals long pandemic goes on.  Well get's much lethal, expect anti-vaxxers die pretty quickly, literally figuratively. Gentlemen. privilege playing tonight. world isnt locked though times course virus going spread quicker ... found it: B.1.1.529
Looks like officially named yet  shit evades immunity vaccination, bet ass we'll see countries passing laws forcing people get updated vaccine. wonder vaccine got Ukraine (Coronavac, i.e. vaccine poor) offers protecting new variant. got jab summer, vaccination certificate valid July 2022, I'm sure get vaccine then. took since inception airline industry governments expecting citizens get booster every 9 months next 100 years??? realistic (!!!). immediate panic variant encouraging.  Wow i'm sorry ignorant thing say. variant evade ""layers"" antibodies, still develop t-cells fight every variant virus charts Twitter news media. boils tested samples, fraction samples new variant increased quite rapidly. must seen proper context. one, infections South Africa low point (~200 cases per day). low levels, one two superspreader events easily propel specific variant top. Furthermore, genetic sequencing often focused potential problem areas, end finding variant actively looking it.

500% faster transmission Delta would make thing contagious virus we've ever encountered, margin. expect estimate come better data becomes available. principle, even worse Delta. soon tell. non essential travel thing anyways middle pandemic?  bright side research vaccines medicine gonna leapfrog decades due incredible funding.  variant, another one? would make way infectious measles contagious virus history humanity. I'm trouble believing moment...  vaxx everyone strict 2 - 4 week lockdown exception unless actually essential workers like power plant workers doctors food provided government?

This wipe covid forever.

Yes, would suck also put end it, meaning everyone spends overall less time lockdown currently. Exactly this. make 40 places sub-Saharan Africa basically tribal elder.  First thank sharing tweets. know biology seems chart tweet seems suggest outcompeting Delta: correct i'm wrong really hope i'm misinterpreting chart chance beginning fight this, squandered it. Let us hope learn f-up. Hey, what’s Nu? know vaccines works Nu?  exactly told? need vaccinate countries, become breeding grounds new variants. exactly happened. Meanwhile Canada like: fine  summarise:

The data shows R value Nu higher measles means:

A) true restrictions useless
B) around got South Africa recently. could building data misleading means scary people making c You’re going ask get shrubbery you?  yes hopefully probably already europe US Twitter calling Nu. named yet, name probably press release meeting happening now, logically would expect skip Nu Xi due confusion / politics. Masks life humanity: please, more

the Covid tag team:   Yet!  hate ask this, options? guess funny, blocking already decided. member states actually block flights. example Germany already announced flights blocked starting today. know mutated, know found. Look 'Spanish' Flu examples.  Yeah typical ""one less thing worry about"" effect. Need scientist know that. 4€ one vaccine? … would separate professional personal accounts bad idea?  Let's hope try make everything lot splashier deaths worse symptoms. Apparently one spreads though toilets way beat turd immunity. recommend getting covid updates reddit. Epidemiologists Twitter like Chise always paint much optimistic picture. reddit declaring lambda mu would set us back square 1, twitter epidemilogists pointing ACTUAL SCIENCE variants unlikely much concern. Guess turned correct.

Once saying early certain anything, think likely new variant evade vaccines even outcompete delta. reason taking hold SA right could SA little delta contend with. Take look this: information take time assume cases congress strain hospitals therefore deaths. That's racism data though makes thing look crazy. 5 times infectious delta.  talking ""the world"" meant borders closures lockdowns. major point conversation. Sorry that. point ""vaccine mandates"". 

&amp;#x200B;

However, focusing countries managed get majority population vaccinated still introduce lockdowns restrictions. Sure, scale vaccines advertised solution nightmare. Portugal, Singapore, Israel... vaccinated population still surge forced lockdowns. Israel use booster dose. point point mandatory vaccines. wanted them, got them. option (IMO) antivaxxers pay hospital get admitted COVID vaccine. However, restrictions go. Yeah, tend kill everybody end. :'(   That's almost worse. I'm mass panic, ya'll make like New Zealand go lockdown stop thing. Wait they’re calling nu? That’s gonna cause lot confusion. Intuitively, think evolution survival, really lays eggs die. going deadly  curious this. waning vaccine protection play part mutations occur? don’t, fact it’s already present many countries area suggest it’s already. South Africa probably first one capability detect spread I'm concerned showing worse symptoms contagious.  it’s bad appears, it’s already anyway. goal virus replicate. covid average time death something like 18 days. highly transmissible, takes long kill host, there's evolutionary pressure strain become less deadly. get really sick nightmare could quite quickly probably way hoping for. Life (!) come back eventually. rather easy improve vaccines tackle new variants. People get vaccinated, immune infection die. usually optimist, think last bad winter face.

There many good years come. Take care friend send PM needed. always, deaths we're seeing new infections three weeks ago. There's also still highly encourage everyone follow epidemiologists like Chise Twitter. variant, previous variants, usually rounded therefore optimistic outlook reddit comments. general consensus I'm seeing that, definitely can't sure anything yet, think variant evade vaccines, think likely outcompete delta, reason taking hold South Africa may simply South Africa whole lot delta right (as shown linked graph). looking like effectiveness wears , way tetanus shot virus successful host spreads longer time. involves killing host immediately. matter kills host hosts infectious 10 days (hypothetical) either die get better without infectious remaining days. Thank you! ain't hot. fancy names actually naming system decided start using May 2021:

[WHO announces simple, easy-to-say labels SARS-CoV-2 Variants Interest see variants tracks page:

[Tracking SARS-CoV-2 fancy names based [greek ""Nu"" next unused letter, people already started calling South African variant ""Nu"". really annoys idiots say this

I severe TB years ago. bad talking minute made couch really bad catch breath...JUST TALKING. yet times, wearing mask never made breathing difficult

If wearing mask problem lungs fucked up, idiots wear one Nice UK government acted quickly borders. unfortunately won’t thing countries don’t place bans also. Israel, Malawi Hong Kong, apparently cases need added temporarily.

Domestically, either Plan keeps us functioning go lockdown. Plan B doesn’t change picture seen Scotland, Wales every European country. either variant going put us back quite bit keep control ways/won’t outcompete delta. 

Keep safe everyone, fingers crossed it’s another “beta scare” agree hospital get overwhelmed matter.  Shutting things temporarily real way (not half-assed way lot countries it) much less damaging ongoing half-measures stretch pandemic longer needs to. Countries like NZ successfully controlled virus real measures better economic recovery didn’t. weren’t successful solely due island.   may another test fail.

So... Yes. Sorry bad. guys literally angels. tell people time. Sorry don’t hear enough, thank bottom heart. mean sincerely.   data regarding lethality variant comparison others? Absolutely relevant silver lining - worse even comes worse! sucks.

Did know deaf? coworker wears large “I’m Deaf, ignoring you” button t-shirt travels work people-impatience issues various types.  Assuming adapt you’d also still get morons won’t take it, take it. obvious? Stop trying achieve herd immunity, happen. vaccinations (first&amp;second dose) excelent prevent deaths. People expecting everyone annual booster protect unvaccinated. issue this: almost surely, even constant vaccination, waves stop. Specially another strain contagious Delta appears. feel bad im sure Covid still cares get point article UK news source. Fact free alarmism karma name one Omega. stays true worse variants. number coming new SA variant 500% infectious? keep seeing Twitter  Die chump lmao wouldn’t surprised already factor spittle particles still worry? Happy cake day! anti-vaxxers sure make worse. problem - majority population protects them, making equally dangerous. get punished yet excellent labs detecting new variants, magically appeared only. 

Thanks EU fuckers. Kick hospitality travel industry whilst you. Michigan? I’m Michigan sounds like Michigan. dissenting opinions? No. Alpha effect (some) Pcr tests.

There happens mutation fragment certain Pcr kits test gene, result tests give false negative result.

 Pcr test kits typically test 3 separate genes would expect 3 positive true result, random mutations occasionally get double positive only. 

If particular variant negative property, get pretty accurate assessment whether specific negative variant without need full sequencing. That’s it, quit nursing. Totally agree. Oh definitely does, kills fast spread fast enough end goal, play plague Inc know It’s gonna burn matter happens. too. Solidarity. us first half ngl  important point.

Doing disincentives countries honest reporting. don’t want slapped ‘country variant’ label likelihood didn’t actually start there. discovered there. ""Already control"" implies *had* control point - never case. Hello darkness old friend [3 choices data behind really patchy people need stop throwing 'findings' like variants taught us anything, it’s new variants far widespread think are. wife playing safe assuming it’s US.  co-worker going distraught. 4 weeks holiday booked christmas back south africa. seen mum almost 4 years now. Many people may realize supposed get Tetanus booster every decade.

Others may old enough few.

When stupid inury resulting severe carpet burn legs, given Tetanus booster, bacteria lives soil everywhere shoes been.  feel you. hoping stuff would gone 3 week old son reached age forms memories, go school, seems less likely going happen time goes on.

The thing worry towing line safety getting heated situations fox News kool-aid drinkers antivax morons. parents recently got called cowards canceling dance classes abiding state's restrictions. We've shit two years, knowledge vastly improved messaging not.

I think mean *government healthcare infrastructure spending* increased improved. That’s problem is.

All things need implemented well-funded public health agencies. can’t expect businesses care covid bottom line. won’t. New aunts always get clicks  know right! Still unemployed original strain Australian international border policies

Was looking forward return international students might delay things even reality people stand solidarity. can't aspire people behave look people behave Eh that's 6 months.

Pronounced. spreads ten times faster delta vaccines work could light end tunnel.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Collective “we” don’t test samples enough. think, based it’s showing everywhere sudden, it’s wild there’s realization it’s already control. 

Guessing obviously. Here’s two cents issue. *I’m studying US family lives Botswana variant first discovered.* Botswana significant turn past month number cases averaging 30 cases day total Nu first hit. much seems scary quickly NU became thing, really isn’t surprising really Delta compete think would frivolous jump conclusions yet transmissibility vs Delta. say despite Nu there, Botswana still well reducing case numbers across country comparing measles, it’s probably bad based I’ve seen heard back home. Obviously can’t ignore data South Africa also didn’t much delta begin either, think need science catch what’s actually going rushing conclusions. Restrictions vaccinations go hand hand stop mutations emerging spreading. warn dropping measures amongst abysmal vaccination rates. Im feeling like parrot constantly repeating CDC, amonst others, guidelines, people want hear not.
Everyone pandemic fatigued standing solidarity way out. worries. There’s lot misunderstanding going around too!😉 really feel like side plague internet game again. thing included antivaxxers.  funny? racist? Travel restrictions hurt economy, dont care. Corporations run country, citizens. Shit, citizens write proposal, petition get ballot, vote initiative law election, corporations lobby(pay/bribe) government change law however see fit. profit healthcare systems bad. Saving lives shouldn’t depend whether corporation feels like make money it. use taxes everyone pays things, instead relying whims pharmaceutical companies. doesnt feel like “oh we’re making sure we’re ahead plan” either. feels like “oh fuck we’re 2 weeks behind already” kinda moves.    Don’t silly, one TWO television sets. wish could COVID hospitals regular hospitals. staff could rotate deal idiots while, regular procedures patients around virus hospitalized. 40% hardly effective there’s tons people double vaxxed got covid immediate panic

mmmm, noticed well. like smelling wisp smoke, wondering fire is, large might be.  Same, though think might Tuesday. really alarming considering WHO, etc dragged feet ages acknowledging threat Delta posed even though painfully obvious least month something unique terrible happening India. Shit. Belgian Fauci :D make sense. incidence vaccinated 80 unvaccinated 1700 Bavaria/Germany. vaccine must much efficient. matter? well squander again

This insane statement. vaccines saved millions lives already. Regardless problems anti-vaxxers represent. Except viruses need host dead live-threatening condition order able spread. See Ebola. Spreads via blood, hemoraghic fever is. raising twins, infants heard ""survive 5"" lot.  9 year old says, ""hey, least Black Death!"" deminshing effect time immunity covid, slower wave theory result higher probability virus mutating, people reinfected immunity towards covid drops time. Whereas herd immunity would see everyone around world get infected relatively quickly making harder new strain infect people immune system seen immunity covid deminish yet.

This nonsense.

The reason got newest variant is, low vaccination rate South-Africa. Add fact, 1 5 HIV means lot vulnerable. one article read woman (with HIV without vaccination) virus **260** days gave enough freedom mutate again. 

How people like still act vaccination irrelevant simultaneously completely misinterpreting terms like herd immunity beyond me. easily look shit minutes.

If people like wake mutation hits us (and hit us hard!) big fucking trouble. Delta appears severe wild alpha, probably due extra growth rate. Yes first wave considered pandemic time symptoms mortality rate similar flu. Cheers, thank insight!  partly true.

But market also reacts basis whether *everyone else* react. whether something actually materially happen.

The stock market plunges sort stupid reasons. Ultimately, it’s inherently boom bust cycle, doesn’t take lot send jenga tower tumbling right timing. Honestly? give flying fuck anymore. again? viruses do, routinely mutate. Especially vaccinate people put travel restrictions. basically puts pressure virus create escape mutation. already everywhere, cases Israel even come South Africa, one Madagascar, one Jordan  Comic Sans liked metaphor, there's even video last year goes fucking clue said seems like know stuff. hope wrong dooms day.  Thanks 🙏 sharing Pretty racist imo Well… good person who’s asymptomatic, bad people around clue they’re around someone infected. I'll thankful every one. dinosaurs probably shared similar sentiment good hear. Hopefully sign vaccinated still protected serious illness strain they're learners. readers. [Who left fridge open? think gotten down-voted. 
If worried serious illness death current boosters needed understand original 2-dose regiment provides adequate protection. 
I hoping either find targets perhaps another form delivery mucosal neutralizing antibody titer higher (hopefully longer). opposite problem country. Vaccine hesitancy fueled, part, false thinking that, since vaccines 100% successful preventing transmission, there's point getting vaxxed. 

Stupid stupid does.   work lack control. Self-responsibility thing works. gentle tugging.   also possible mutations could make transmissible yet less apt cause illness death. (hopefully). Nay Curious, skeptical… wondering data points comparing testing/reporting data? haven’t found reliable ones yet. country that? test individual vaccines? Covid, slightly different. vaccine base, just, well, vaccine base. get it. can't know this.   is. know unhealthy? Dying. since doctors made clear would probably die got Covid vaxxed kind prioritize living thing.  probably like Delta, already everywhere become dominant variant. change rate relative ratio strains primary thing computing transmissibility. raw number cases circulation point time really tell that. like Delta battle death strains. spread efficiently, eventually became prominent. found Israel Hong Kong already   include citations? around forever, keep catching it, making health worse worse time. alternative suggesting? Locking everyone covid disappears? dare using *logic*!   sounds like someone Nintendo naming   ""And truly emergency, they'd stop travel right now, tomorrow.""

Right.  seeing kids 2 years unhealthy though?  probably already spread continents, detected everywhere yet.  really ignorant number places across globe able willing manufacture vaccine? 

Seriously? I’m expecting/hoping severe disease drastically reduced incidences reinfection/breakthrough.   Fair enough. regularly pissed anti-vax/anti-lockdown crowd long time, always maintained restrictions end vaccines treatments became available all...even meant accepting higher deaths denying care unvaccinated.

Now piss people used support me..and anti-vax morons seem think I'm one stuck claim. sensationalized. follow couple immunologists Twitter (I know, social media, look well respected scientific community) saying healthy, fully vaccinated people concerned. lot cases new variant found fully vaccinated travelers tested travel idea covid. I’m sick “the sky falling” reporting. articles state data needed.  name working well, there’s way god isn’t intentionally fun us it’s vaccine then?  EDIT: I'd also add Hong Kong case double vaxxed Pfizer is, yet, asymptomatic. good sign.

Both Hong Kong cases double Pfizer vaccinated. second caught first even though far apart floor direct contact quarantine hotel. early tell.
But verrry preliminary indicates perhaps transmitted less harmful.

But again, early tell need permanent federal indoor mask mandate

This way true, unvaccinated people, risk virus spread evolve. 

All statistics shown vaccinated people spread virus way unvaccinated cut 60% strength virus could difference finally catching pandemic control losing control move toward global endemic even bigger disaster earlier 2020. feel like back square one. look good all.  Thanks link. feeling frustrated lack action government comes meeting Covax obligations, time rolling booster shots population. allowed help bit can. long virus reach shores? pandemic. main worry already replaced Delta number communities  please expand us slow ones back? Thats crazy, im Australia know relatively untouched. live Johannesburg, 5km city centre. mass panic, business usual far.  feel way to. blame news reporting. fear-mongering clicks. something higher negative beta like SDOW. never said easy, current way things working even using fraction resources disposal. amount despot leaders really think jabs make way arms citizens sold countries?

That nonsense defeatist even know say it. sounds perhaps FDA got lot blowback regarding initial usual six-months wait period vaccine. ""almost certainly"" ? certain anything sort. know vaccine resistent. vaccine would provide even %5 protection, going help it’s actually virus’ benefit super deadly. 

Which actually really apply COV-19, since mainly spreads heavy symptoms set it. evolutionary pressure many viruses have. Sorry. Fair enough. previous comment different impression. I've edited mine now.  see pointed twitter Problem predicted high levels immune escape even cell escape spike mutations. interesting see vaccines hold one hopefully reports early findings Ah good old days interesting know whether vaccinated cases progress serve disease really going matter globally. planning meeting arrange meeting discuss meeting afterwards. Look Delta compete versus Nu Yep stuff!  expert, believe policies around vials introduced primarily bacterial infections like MRSA viruses like Hep C. Obviously also stops prions.

You'd shocked often medical practices reuse needles vials, late father suffered blood borne pathogen attacked upper spine due needle reuse chemotherapy treatments. think something like quarter million people seek testing due errors like yearly.  Borosilicate Pyrex-type glass unless I'm mistaken, able, say, withstand extreme temps. It’s very, concerning it’s still 100% confirmed it’s much worse delta, cases SA starting low base. think we’ll find it’s worse delta bad graph implies.  Eventually pandemic turn endemic. That’s probably hope for. maybe talking back make easier bio engineer sickness too? Well complicated. Death affects different population groups differently. story Africa point low vaccination rates (8%) managed large deaths. theory might genetic anomaly makes population less susceptible dying covid. also know 14 day clock started. 14 days ago 30 days ago? like said end comment increased deaths clear next week two, India example, Delta spreading killing alarming rate. huge lag infections severe complications. mean HIV, immune system compromised unique way. HIV. Ebola different pathogen  capitalist vaccine capitalist vaccine also $0? cool ppl gotta stop naming does, gonna confusing  Coronau coronau ye fking clout buss nut im out, 50 Hoes south got coronau mouth 💦💦 Yikes market also super irrational wouldn’t use sole determining factor severity. There’s ton data nu variant it’s fear, uncertainty doubt; it’s necessarily indicator nu severity rather uncertainty.

You also lot market freaking Didi delisting signals larger issues US/China relations, would put much larger reason markets right now. concern variant _may_ evade immunity vaccines, even convalescent plasma treatment. true, real cause concern. way past point countries even contact tracing. Number infections way high.  Nu actually economic gain: Johnson's trade policy leave country poorer would otherwise everybody knows it. mainly keeping pretence Brexit good idea. Signing new trade deals world important thing, that's something before; whether actually brings benefit entirely immaterial, matters public gets message 'See, got Brexit done, enabled us new things!' didn’t discover variant last week? possibly give ‘mortality rate’?!?  read, goal essentially viruses kill host. hopefully 🙏 Option 2 might solve climate change though, so, silver lining all. Lol wow. Let ppl live , tyrant Highly unlikely.

A fortunate trait Nu mutation exact right spot make PCR tests give somewhat unexpected results.

PCR tests normally check multiple (3 so) different pieces viral genome. normal situations, 3 present active infection. However, variant mutation one parts many PCR tests look for. tests trigger 2 3 pieces. makes possible identify variant without full genetic sequencing. Alpha variant property.

Note Germany still genetic sequencing well. variant meaningful contribution current infections, would've picked already. western countries new variant causing major outbreaks flying radar. may sequencing capacity early detection, variant starts play major role, spotted.  one 32, iirc Man's Mia   Haaaate headlines like this. It’s South Africa discovered here, scientists South Africa like sharing. Shits probably around world twice. re-invent vaccines? Nani?! fear monger, they're still getting underlying information experts forefront this

Who lied you?   lower seed points though buys time understand variant. Covid Zombies best Zombies. Ok, expected moronic comment like appear. surprise.

Here interesting point: exterminating Covid, many percentage people think need comply strict measures like total lockdown?

The answer 100%. 99.99% 99.999%. can’t one single case non-compliance entire PLANET, outbreak. simply virus works inter-connected world. 

Not mentioning Humankind design possible “cooperate” extent, even case, always mistakes made. 

Now returning original question. new wave doomed re-emerge restrictions lifted, purpose restriction anyway? None, destroying livelihoods.

We going co-exist virus, living fantasy restrictive world imagining. Accept it, not.  fuck.. I’m getting feeling shit hit fan 2020. Like started One place weeks later global pandemic. I’m kind freaking trying wait data.
Any news US &amp; travel bans yet😰  anything actually happen people? considered lawful order One thing I’ve experienced beginning pandemic continue works. family circle 9 social distanced beginning, wore masks upgraded kn95 heard variants got vaccinated soon could. We’re also planning get boosters based 6 months second shot fortune say didn’t get sick. saw around us getting sick quite scary last year. works don’t live fear. Tune noise focus brings hope joy. Wait, available? different formular something? head always thought children get vaccine, dose. One quirk seems differentiated PCR test make far simpler track previous strains relied genomic sequencing. Could spreading faster could also obvious spreading. already Israel. US. shut flights now.

I friends trapped Zimbabwe new quarantine arrangements arranged. fear anyone going hotel quarantine. went %1 tests SA %80 3 weeks. outcompeting Delta. new variant nearly 8x mutations Delta still outcompeting Delta South Africa









That mean severe, right? guaranteed infectious, severe. There’s going lot countries announce cases next short period time. 

I fear dark weekend progression pandemic. Delta cases SA low point (200-300 per day), principle unfortunate superspreader events push new variant top. variant cause concern, lets rush conclusions based minimal data. scientists need couple weeks run research figure dynamics virus vitro.  draw conclusion spreads faster? sources I’ve read says number mutations real concern here, data whether spreads faster not. whether evades vaccines.  Try ‘this podcast kill you’, explain fascinating info various pathogens mutate others.  Hong Kong areas too.   high volumes Germany since weeks. Nu variant Germany would detected there.......    Spanish flu still around well, still kills dozens thousands year. became endemic say ""a disease that's still around normally"".

Perhaps read pandemic vs endemic stages diseases Spanish flu still around.  Wieler clear that. also stated infection numbers likely two even three times higher recorded numbers.

I say let unvaccinated pay mess. see reason restrict private life personal connections fully vaccinated (apart kids).
And I'm alone. yes, probably also drives number infection unvaccinated indirectly. need face consequences wrongdoing. okay let everyone suffer minority decided ignore facts refuses protect others.
Let run doom.
But also provide triage rules reflect situation, maybe let carry financial burden treatment.

I'm sick tired people. I'm alone. nice, long “I’m sick tired sick tired.
Feels like every day I’m just, feeding fire some..
All answers I’m sure.
I wish best, cannot help anymore.
And I’ve come.. realize I’m fucked nowhere left run. 
And don’t wanna afraid more, I’m leaving baggage right, front door. 
Can come in, I’ll sip cup,
Anticipate chaos watch whole room erupt. 
And tell honesty, friends like these, needs enemies?
Oh brother, please! Won’t humor me?
I.. want enjoy company one last time. 
Cause know.. we’ll never again.
And clock strikes midnight, over, brand new day bound begin.”
-Pasadena

My friend’s uncle works music industry, rare sample CD band, “Pasadena” like ‘03-‘05? Never made big can’t find anything group. started free styling lyrics flow. got bit Michael Franti Spearhead, similar vibe. 

Wherever peeps are… mad love. know lyrics songs, idea #1 fan there!  28 days later? anyone seen indication new variant deadly? isn't, may ticket pandemic  Ya concerned. trying get travel ban “omg new strain” articles blasted information presented. new strain NU got news I'm stuck Botswana flights either fully booked cancelled UK. crazy 4 cases Botswana hope far less aggressive previous strains. Probably same. obese, ~~hiv tb infected~~ countries terrible healthcare bad inequality

USA

/s Gooooood point didn’t think that. thought maybe virus stabilized terms effects point. absolute conjuncture based opinion presented data moment. would travel ban work EU? Hundreds thousands people commute daily non-EU countries EU, vice-versa. Tweet graph, official source. new variant nearly 8x mutations Delta still outcompeting Delta South Africa. could mean variant contagious able evade immunity previous infections.

At least three positive cases vaccinated. guys like afraid  Hopefully everyone chance look Taiwan's response coupled economic growth result zero covid. holding breath though. Map new B 1.1.529 variant cases : followed COVID story since beginning, might give PTSD... natural trait viruses, i.e. spanish flu mutating become less deadly. won’t know information cases south africa reasonable chance mutation would “break” virus hamper pathogenicity. simultaneously *more* transmissible delta less mortality (unlikely), would actually slow spread covid significantly competing delta lowering mortality. kind scenario typical ending viral pandemics (like spanish flu). 

this also delta big deal, infectious severe higher viral loads. even pretend like everywhere yet even enter uk directly 6 countries - still 100% enter somewhere else. people 6 countries still travelling around world. Idk think stops getting through

This banning countries work. easy get unless shut absolutely nations. even difficult south africa detects new variant, puts sequencing capacity region outbreak (with little delta begin little competition), journalist extrapolate new variant transmissable? Someone else seeing bad statistical exercise right here?    hear that, curiosity? GOT OPTOMETRIST HERE! suspicion transmissible deadly based news relevant time stamp.

Delta took 100 days become 90% cases South Africa.

This new variant taken 14 days become 90% cases South Africa.

If variant deadly would know since almost saturated South Africa. killed 2X people killed 2X faster news story South Africa detected new strain would morgues capacity.

Still, knows... deaths start next week strain we'll find out. Hard say severity, early data suggests much transmissible. Thanks clarification! *My* fellow Americans well. I'm ex-pat here. :) hope get chance visit soon. thought four months away maybe going back office. Thank kindly. fact socialism never implemented ignored. zero socialist countries. capitalist varying degrees democracy. Socialism never tried corruption.

You need take good long look entirety society examine socialism actually entails. never done beyond small examples like ones gave, poor quality corrupt capitalists continuously erode them.

But I'm sure eloquence awaits.   Well fuck. probably already :D fucking dare you, idea much sacrificed measures taken.

I'm triple vaccinated, wore reusable N95 mask 2 years, following public health guidance even started giving it.

I'm fucking problem, people like anti-vax brother partied lockdown went nto work whilst living infected girlfriend are.  feel like people unreasonable hysterical Nu variant. already I’ll give go, OP correct I’m wrong. 

If virus “bad guy”, good description look like, immune system keep look kill start massive gang takes whole body. 

However, bad guy mutated (adapted immunity - opportunity replicate billions times single body, creating potential ‘lucky’ mutations), sudden, instead able identify suspect blank-foot-tall, this-gender, these-clothes wearing, etc. virus shows one inflatable dinosaur costumes antibodies (police, local community defenses, whatever) never seen doesn’t know identify. Sure may know showed dino costume, don’t know dino real talons teeth… and! dino making dinos don’t way identify eliminate them. real “bad guy” hiding behind new defense, don’t know fight growing mafia.

They’re spreading fast bodies overcome, blind-sighted new invaders… way identify infiltrate (and infect) ability defend all. 

That may great metaphor it’s came fingers phone.. wonder many countries politicized vaccine like US has? No. People travelled SA HK Israel. Botswana near Gauteng.

Yiure exaggerating flights regularly coming five South African cities landing six major US cities, closest city Chicago. 2020, 25,000 people South Africa traveled US (greatly diminished pandemic; formerly around 500,000/year). Might stop send invite.  first vaccine 2021, 2020, right?

Capitalism system governance, literally monetary expression corruption. Greed, self-servance power/money seeking, willingness hinder 'opponents' (and even willingness see others opponents, rather equals) self society-defeating.

Africa's situation complicated, especially there's newer, virulent strain COVID there. Anybody 'doesn't want vaccine' unfortunately disadvantaged ignorance, anti-vaxxers. ignorance symptom capitalism forms corruption. Hence classes people classes country (third first world), something would happen healthy society takes care everyone.

I'm proposing system. I'm proposing health integrity, everyone, including education, including trauma (relational, complex, types) I'm pointing need stop corruption - first acknowledging asking honestly, need change? Factually incorrect. dominating popping up. That's complete lie. There's 2 cases HK quarantine took 4 pcr tests show up. people, lifetime might shorter expected Surfs up. *Same ol shit again*

*Walking avenue*

*365 days we’ll through*

*And won’t look you*  think contracted it. Vaccinated since April. 4 days booster. Mask wearing, hand sanitizing car, vigorous hand washing 2 years, got near death sick grocery run apparently. Infected family too. According Department Health, 12/13 symptoms, neither wife kids, did. tested positive PCR tests, twice.  Good luck there. Yeah one thing legit don’t get…why haven’t heard new vaccines deleveloped? heard months mRNA awesome Bc tweak vaccine super quickly new variants. we’ve Delta main strain worldwide months haven’t heard single peep tweaking vaccine Delta…wtf Okay definitely explain way better me, reading place right probably explained wrong. makes sense thank So, catch Covid vaccination, also get ""natural"" immunity? I'm tired  mean several different flus colds though. virus called something different even though symptoms same. names even different SARS-CoV-1 vs SARS-CoV-2.   whole point mRNA vaccines quickly adapt new variants produce new variant-specific mRNA vaccines. Somehow got thrown plan we're still alpha. still reduce illness death, delta-specific booster would much better. agree 
I’m Welsh first (and one last) lockdown UK. People lockdown nervous thought “it okay, get new year deal it” sort mindset.

Then remember us getting told 5pm going lockdown midnight. entire mood everyone knew sank. everyone Christmas shopping stage, people rely seasonal work crying lost huge chunk wages needed survive till spring. Inability meet family.

I think people UK don’t want even think going back lockdown form restrictions completely demoralised ruined lot peoples Christmas. meant break negativity ruined Oh wow. guess there's sliver hope outcompetes Delta immuno-evasive makes lighter cases. holding ventilator here, could bad.  Given people soon either vaccinated COVID-19, viral spread we’re monitoring essentially become spread new common cold. Haha ""just thought out, pull back in"" deteriorated quickly. couple days ago, list sort like ""only 10 cases, nothing worry ...""   pandemic end soon

Not collectively take enough measures end won't. People like large part still problem. Sars-cov-2 mutate become virulent? Throughout pandemic point emphasis variants transmissibility increase. may bad, come it’s virulence increased tandem higher transmissibility? Lmao, what!?🗿 Jet Blue Variant? EU slow making decisions Would late boomers, though Perfectly fine. Unfortunately let us thing peace... Guess I’ll learn SCBA  100% - it’s impossible pinpoint outbreak lock down. 

Unfortunately, is. get named designated VoI least believe. “I won’t listen too: Electric boogaloo!” Let's get down, let's get B.1.1529! 🎶🤷‍♂️ 50% vaxxed

We're around 85% vaxxed, positivity numbers staying steady, coming down. Worst though, deaths way higher year ago. Mostly non-vaccinated, lot elderly people yet received 3rd shot.  


I really worry places like US low vaccination rates. many travelling Thanksgiving, next weeks going look pretty bad. :( bad, felt bit fluey 3-4 days it. Tired stuffy nose boat friend. worst surge last months it’s getting worse. I’m tired done it, getting extremely burnt out. Idk super deadly???  flair 3 years biochemistry back days. really goal, mutations random, initially could go either way. mutations make virus fit, survive became dominant. Depending virus lesser lethality may effect fitness. example killing host quickly affect killing month infection due side effects immunity already cleared virus really effect fitness   I'm fairly sure UKs late fall/early winter wave Alpha Delta. Fair enough. Thanks info  I'm hoping miracle strain completely asymptomatic infects everyone quickly. Seems like reasonable response… 990 probable SA??😳 COVID 19 Service Pack 4  odd people different countries refer holidays salient affecting personal lives. Thanks (S)Al.  So, going Nu officially? *sigh*  Thank much contributed, think anyone would fault quiting. lot, lot anyone handle. deserve rest that's want I'd buy spy calls. Betting uncertainty panic Upvote hope. normal worried panic

No, isn't. normal behaviour. Panic irrational response. remain calm truth looks alarming

We know truth yet. There's still lots variant know. previous variants concern turned damp squibs. Calm down. 

Remember certain (not all) media outlets reporting know fear drives clicks. Lots lots people many nations couldn’t get vaccine even gave left arm it. Meanwhile, US, 18+ post vaccine get booster. 

It’s worth discussing unvaccinated people willingly unvaxxed. vaccine available all, continue see lethal variants develop people vulnerable less able protect themselves. 

Also… people access vaccine refuse xyz reason also part problem.. problem. agree disagree? why? Never.    Asymptomatic new variant good news indeed. live area that’s seeing highest infection rate since start pandemic. Around here, virus literally everywhere right now. Last Summer hugging people left right center cases low. I’m responding current situation taking appropriate precautions. don’t know yet frequency (every 6 months year) boosters. that's true 12 - 17yo group. younger children get smaller dose, 30% adults IIRC. substance. Hahaha made day  Airborne contagious vaccines, yeah basically. country didn’t manufacture contribute intellectual resources single vaccine. Meanwhile got first shot vaccine manufactured Belgium 10 hour flight house May 2020. Currently world administered almost 8 billion vaccines, South Africa throwing vaccines people don’t want them. don’t know system you’re proposing (although pretty good guess) wouldn’t deliver better results capitalism delivered  labeled 'Nu' messaging - officially named yet. bacteria concern? would thought prions would big concern, especially considering survive sterilisation procedures like autoclaves. Boomer source. Greedy boomers. Fair point. However, Nu/Delta frequency ratio continues increase, begin state increasing confidence, rather able right one off. called ""Ni!""  likely. goal vaccine reduce serious illness death. vaccine still variants including Delta quite well.

That's kinda point takeaway past two years write Australia hasn’t one lowest Covid death rates earth. thinking since 30 mutations, could skipped omega Fuuuuuuuuuck slow-motion train wreck. Again. Austria go 7 months starting 2022-02-01 Yeah that's comparable several hundreds years ago lack medicine. anything pandemic stay us like flu   Valid. Yep. need plan ahead future variants. It’s going hard winter antivaxx. HAHA idc. Keep coming time world didn’t ability monitor pandemics. 

You made statement path pandemics take basis fact.

The third wave 1918 indeed less deadly second deadly first. 

It’s also little consolation reason less deadly large parts human race acquired natural immunity. cost immunity millions deaths.  Yep. buying time get sense what's going prepare. realize far apart floor sounds different across hall, right?  redditor SLAMS corporate spokesperson  new variant already identified Israel Hong Kong. world. Limiting travel sub-Saharan Africa slow spread, stop it.  mrna, either moderna pfizer/biontech fine. people 30 pfizer recommended.  Dude take look comment thread news article FB. First 27 comments “so shit”; “fear mongering”; “if you’re scared, stay home, letting global elites control us again”. 

It’s pure tomfoolery. Ni ni ni!  That's really good thread. Nothing stopping right care potentially dying something like spreads. layers immune system (like t-cells)

If recall correctly, T-cells activated much strongly AZ vaccine, right?  past 48 hours, South African scientists reviewed PCR test data Gauteng region discovered variant appeared behind increase cases, **having risen account 90% cases matter weeks**. national level, South Africa’s daily number infections hit 1,200 Wednesday, 106 earlier Speaking hastily called news conference Thursday, virologist Tulio de Oliveira said: “We see early signs lineage rapidly increased prevalence Gauteng may already present provinces.”

Well, that's good sign. means one four things:

One: local conditions university caused series super-spreader events complete chance variant one initial infected specific event. get lucky.

Two: local conditions region allow variant out-compete Delta due reduced vaccine effectiveness, meaning example might evade whatever vaccine common SA. SA 28% partial vaccination 24% fully vaccinated, less probable option. May effect specific vaccine(s) used SA. good, worst option.

Three: virus spreads faster delta, R number significantly higher delta's already high R 6. Like delta spread faster alpha. Bad unvaccinated, terrible vaccinated previously infected.

Four: virus evades natural immunity possibly vaccines. Worst case scenario. Bad everyone. Risk levels go back 2 years beginning pandemic, pass go, collect $200.

Let's hope #1. Considering information have, UK government stopping flights countries 110% correct move. learn coming days. 1.	Nu variant

Think first can’t. End story. First case found Europe: young woman vaccinated visited Egypt Turkey (very far Southern Africa).

This least suggesting variant around decent amount time Africa already FUCK think mean “a virus affects children severely population group”. one idiots family.

hey now, lets get far Hence yet. It’s matter “if” cases matter “when”. around since LEAST November 11, would’ve significant amount cases variant countries going severe Delta wave. Specially since lot decent genomic surveillance. Hence, driving infection rates sky high still delta. Let’s hope Delta wins out.

Good luck trying convince mass public retake 2-shot vaccine delta variant marginal increase effectiveness compared first vaccine Yeah that's economics work. Turkey-variant would fun… Endemic pandemic mutually exclusive terms.

Endemic means disease circulates population

Pandemic means disease threatens populations globally. You’re getting downvoted you’re wrong.  

Evolutionary endgame spread. “And deadly” isn’t automatic.  spread host dies, doesn’t matter.

Smallpox didn’t get less deadly, least 3,000 years. I’d love see behavior Singaporean flight lmao, think third cane strike they’d never fight flight attendant again.

Sigh, bring next one... It’s pretty bad here, feel majority people I’m (Midwest) hopefully across US take vaccine. got first one back April so, hope humanity restored long, concert like lines get scheduled shot. Almost amount came second round shots month later. gave hope take shot go day vocal minority make side seem bigger usual. last president, probably felt emboldened, Biden currently clamping stuff like airports kind gotten bit weaker. Young people die. See fast world locks overnight that’s case. reading early last year China shutting whole cities, could believe JFK wide open. never win this. point? people study, work countries cannot transmit virus? narrow point view conduct business almost every sector. Forgive master, must use transmisability, once. Also really DON’T want breathe borosilicate glass dust. think rather ""are B.1.1.529 cases here"" question ""how many"". quick, strong action stop spread important. Contrary UK approach passangers S.A. already entered tested/quarantined procedure underway germany, health minister Spahn said hours ago press conference. isnt giving confidence professional handling. Nevertheless see better approach saw delta. hope you’re right. know who’s actually getting sick there’s nothing much do. worries. long time ago. oh, definitely knew that. hearing friend able speak/sign, told Deaf. translated questions answer, able clearly respond. 

Nah.. understand respond completely “directly”. Since couldn’t, messed luggage make sure it’s “safe”. hearing friends didn’t get treatment. Lot backward ass people there. mistaken. intelligent informed people world trading stocks self-interest. wanted know really stood reference pandemic, one would simply watched financial indices last two years, ignored scientists completely. never ceases amaze me. course vaccination alone won’t cut transmission, can’t expect governments enforce constant restrictions becoming quite unpopular, stressful sake cutting transmission alone. People go get boosters move best can. varent break boosters going stop anyway. think point, new normal. Expect masks updated shots rest life.

There way currently get 8 billion people vaccinated quick enough.  Contact tracing wonderful, squash outbreak less 400 cases day. 4000 day, lost control. Well shit need another word title caps. 

At rate entire headlines caps end next week Uh no, donate millions anti-LGBT organizations gift keeps giving! FUCK BILL MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION. part reason vaccine patented, wasn’t gonna stepped in. Wow, sounds like really care health well-being Europeans.

Europe already enough trouble current variants, need import more. Travel restrictions? 

No. don’t think we're least double vaccinated, matter right now.

Doesn't though? Basic statistics tells us everyone Thanksgiving dinner double vaccinated likely die car accident way dinner Covid acquired there. also many eggs hatch survive reproduce. Otherwise primates would never survived. evolutionary perspective selfish gene. ""'SWEET!' What's mine say?"" mean current predictions infectious correct wont take us long everyone vaccinated, cured dead variant. One hope variant isnt deadly atleast vaccines keep us intensive care. Otherwise world gonna burn. like grammar schools said that, Japan, Mario Brother 14? indicate anything like that, know 100 vaccinated HK people exposed Africa infected. tell us anything, vaccines 100% effective (which already know)  don’t know evades current vaccines. 

The original vaccine boosters worked blunt delta Israel. Reportedly it’s already Israel.

It’s almost certainly already US too. That, sucha great community. fine people sides.. modding community does. Itll go forever like skyrim gta5 Er, no. that. Yes briefly last Q A. 

He states yet anything freak implied overreaction. seemed hesitant think concerning also didnt say impossible. cohost seemed think things going get better worse even two doses give protection years. said bad close borders wonder really got better anything everyone else flight... close managed quarantine facilties? Think rona beaten?  Cured, vaccinated dead new variant comes along vaccines don’t work. right back started doctors forum follow concerns. lot statistical noise expected personally surprised big is. IlA days we’ll know right it’s early tell  agree, one hope. However, infections happen symptoms even appear. like virus would run hosts anytime soon would significant incentive become less deadly.

nice addition wave already going Germany atm...seems like christmas going real blast (again).. Honestly possibly reasonable answer here. simply know. Impossible know evolutionary course virus. Impossible know scientific advancements. Impossible know durability immunity gained every exposure virus. Scientists fortune tellers like educated idiots believe. simply qualified people attempt steer path forward. Sorry hear mate, definitively hard time Human. helps mentally, gym, walks etc. Seeing friends, reading new book series.

Really take time work yourself, hope pull well ) anything link prove States I'd say anti-vax crowd majority conservative Republican.  Pfizer one much effective shared far right? Without shadow doubt.All need wait week world map would sudden start lookin red countries reporting new variant.🤦 8 years this.   first glance might trigger ""it's control!"" reaction, actually might good news, variant going around time already, quite possible nearly contagious initial reports suggested. spike South Africa may least partically caused one unlucky superspreader events. expert, indications transmissible, remarked upon deaths vaccinated, thank goodness. Let’s hope it’s bad sounds certain extent, vaccines effective original strain US joined chat. going mandate booster, recommend it. also national pass enforce vaccination Likely U.S already , question now. Biden react accordingly. Pay attention UK, actually genomic testing. soon. Israel, Hong Kong, Belgium (Europe's first case) confirmed first ""Nu""  developed symptoms 11 days returning Egypt too, long side. Possible may caught Belgium. mean idiot antivaxxers die faster? Please say yes please say yes

Please stop bs. still people world don’t access vaccines people can’t get vaccinated health conditions. Well, almost six hours. good morning stay safe Even Delta cause this.  feel like even Delta affected markets much.   Without understanding hospitalization rate severity symptoms cant really deduce actually dangerous, could become virulent incredibly mild (no symptoms) variant actually would help us end pandemic. negate ever doctor? sure point is.

You can't hundreds thousands infections expecting bad mutation happen point. #winning  whole, rural counties certainly skew towards republican. Luckily city majority democrat balance out. someone else pointed fact woman infected Egypt suggests variant already spreading time. wonder suggests it’s less severe since seems flown radar awhile. dominant less severe strain Covid would actually good thing no? shit! least people sense him. come less severe assumption? can't wait right say travel bans racist. fantastic news virus relatively mild (little symptoms) low hospitalization rate, faster spread quicker basically get 100% vaccination almost health concern could both, could neither two one them. arent mutually exclusive data rare still analyzed.  like there's good reason drug scepticism ""Panic"" strong word. Nobody wants guy/girl sat hands waited long *yet again* variant. Better look like taking swift action maybe seen over-cautious person seem learn lessons previous slow action. also know ""spreading fast"". point honestly one knows anything thing looks quite bit different. going take bit time something quantifiable. Virus balance patch 1.529 No, *Democrats* fault many Americans died. must serious UK Govt done something quickly: they’re usually days weeks behind everybody else. Yes true vaccines aswell. great overview explanation found here, take look: questions answered *How Oxford-AstraZeneca Vaccine Works* example. genetics virus changes mutations, possibly also spike protein. *The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine based virus’s genetic instructions building spike protein.* people want live book video game take servants sex slaves them. North Dakota: Hold beer. Amateur space mean seriousness infection/fatality rate? predictions that? transmissible? mean? Right, let’s give try nothing know less severe? Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s technical lead Covid-19, said press briefing Thursday: “We don’t know much [variant] take weeks us understand impact variant has,” Kerkhove said, adding variant “under monitoring” “something watch”.

They know yet - one does. doomsday scenario mutation A. as/more contagious, B. as/more lethal, C. renders vaccines entirely useless (as opposed less effective) thrown around well year, general consensus satisfy 3 criteria would incredibly unlikely. plague like? ....is plague? Yeah except delta doesn’t evade vaccination. Let’s hope one won’t either… Indeed. assuming U.S., timing worse holiday gatherings travel. 

I know people like lockdowns locking several weeks right would make difference hard hits us. Waiting hospitals verge collapse anything drastic really make sense... everyone abysmal office experience, everyone can't handle social interactions.

On one hand, WFH advantages, commute perks.

On hand, blending place rest/deloading place work, aswell isolated comes cost mental well being. (not everyone, some) Someone using head…. Literally!! keeping Delta bay vaccination rates high, NZ ensured handful deaths current outbreak.

With respect Nu, NZ maintained MIQ system Nu case picked there. NZ still tries genetically sequence every covid case, high degree confidence already entered NZ.

Because this, NZ time properly assess threat Nu variants pose, adapt policies needed. can't save us all. may damn plague, might floating around long time. responsibility keep plague. reason hospital workers quit droves first 3 waves Covid19 ravaging mental health. 4500 beds vanish. healthcare workers man say. thing works.

But doesn't, we've discovered failure responsibility far reaching consequences. Hard blame seniors care homes caregivers bringing in. works select few. rest claw make anything it. know little symptoms (or lack symptoms) new variant Yep, Belgium pass US total infections per capita, UK also pass US day now--Netherlands already passed US identify it. state's shutting testing tracking agency come New Years. isnt problem can't look Yeah think you’re right buy time know bad variant is. Well, great vaccine still effective strain

source? Already Belgium Israel. doubt point every contain. think buy another week sort thing. totally futile anyway, live globalised world transmissible Delta even immediate flight shut downs it'd slow inevitable I'm sure 100% accurate equate transmission rate R0.

This new variant could spreading faster simply cases low (no competition), people distancing much, on. think necessarily higher R0 happen.

It necessarily R0 40 spread ""faster"". could spread rate slower look ""faster"" opportunity. US won't. unless literally bodies piling up. Tell rich fucks stop hording Sumatra... Can't find anywhere anymore. It’s right! /s There's information either way. Yeah, got Source?

Yikes. think first new variant since Delta experts saying it’s worth worrying about. 100 days develop, 4-5 months trials approval. thing 3rd wave then.

Yeah I’ve told trusted people think handle basically thing ultimately going take us out. without vaccine. I’m vaccinated teeth but…still real bad feeling. Happy Holidays None. I’d actually wager it’s likely got Belgium. 11 day incubation isn’t unheard of, it’s certainly much longer mean incubation period, even original wild type virus.  Belgium confirmed first case well.  

then us probably... SEE! VACCINES CAUSE DIARRHEA!! /S  Please Biden meet mRNA companies international travel ban slow down. 

With vaccines tool Nu 2 months dinosaur FDA lets them. I’ve even see people claiming worse state early 2020, basically data. Kinda wild. mean, understand people jump extreme conclusion we’ve past two years. still. stoicism us well. SA get pummeled Delta Winter theory left behind considerable amount natural antibodies provided resistance. perhaps claims natural immunity superior really hold true fact running rampant province bore brunt Delta wave 3-4 months ago speaks that. don’t think test people Covid variant infected. incentive profit panic however. mean science market suddenly ""recovers"" monday? headlines scientists interviewed saying vaccines ""still mostly stop serious Covid illness"". interview say seems vaccine evasive. variant vaccine evasive still stop serious Covid illness? work? we're going need toilet paper already 4 confirmed cases Israel, least 3 vaccinated, one got booster two months ago. know spike proteins one mutated believe evade immunity. don’t know whether spikes mutated lethal. Scientists always believed would eventually happen Covid. would mutate point evades immunity turns harmless. Hopefully case. evades immunity becomes damaging we’re boned. going long winter Europe... USA, many hospitals dangerously overwhelmed. 

Trust me, want like us. Influenza kills many people....

Until last year is. shame accept it, perhaps design better buildings develop better social standards reduce spread diseases. safely assumed occur lifetimes all. 

No? immediately going back old ways second direct threat anymore?  remove restrictions let people enjoy lives. Florida lockdowns mask mandates, numbers different anywhere else US. difference Florida we're allowed live lives, hate everyone around us. first case new COVID variant young, unvaccinated woman returned Egypt Nov. 11 developed symptoms 11 days later

So, minimum, know new variant Egypt, since woman 15 days spread it, probably Belgium too. know news regarding India, anyone idea bad get? early ask? think mentally strong enough go scenario like second wave again.

Also booster shots India, yet. Everyone unvaccinated - except immunocompromised - Germany **is** willingly though. Plus infects enough people within short enough time frame, hospital overloaded people start dying inadequate/denied care auxiliary causes. Lame would bit surprising. Incubation times trending shorter every new variant. crowded living/working situations would speed transmission, probably enough generate 50+ mutations, many rarely seen before, Nu variant. 

At least one expert yesterday alluded [the HIV+ woman SA whose virus gained 32 mutations 7 month infection. infections resolve immunocompromised, virus continue evolve, search [fitness perhaps valleys person-to-person transmission hindered, back higher peaks. 

And 23 million HIV+ persons sub-Saharan Africa.

There's good chance variant originate South Africa all, discovered there, cluster big university town (Tshwane), would gone undetected rest sub-Saharan Africa. Lock down, get booster, wear mask. You’re delusional think people masked There’s difference fear mongering basic awareness. 

I covid last December mostly bedridden 6 months. 34 years old, super healthy fit, worked 4-5 times per week, health problems whatsoever. I’m lucky 95% recovered now, know many people still suffering year later. 

Current statistics show 10% people get COVID symptoms lasting 4 weeks. anything chronic fatigue, chest pain, difficulty breathing, neurological issues, migraines, etc. everyone US gets COVID, would 30 million people long lasting symptoms. Tbf also first ”read” mais pas.

But corrected article said, without guessing might intended. even dying people dying fast, they're 1–2% infected. Asymptomatic carriers also godsend virus, variants Yes, might public-health game standards Venice fifteenth century. can't know this. 

We solid evidence yet effectiveness vaccine mutated spike protein. actual numbers though?  Tbh, travel Egypt, period. safe place young women.  thread decent info looks like completely evade vaccine could try less dramatic.  Absolutely. Without lockdowns think one month two UK 80k+ cases thanks new mutation.

BJ going ruin Christmas everyone. Made mistake looking Twitter saw someone saying ""they"" coming new variant push people get booster. just... know we're going survive species kind shit rattling around people's heads.  French, sentence really weird without ""pas"" ""mais"". I'd bet simply forgot put in. 500% figure thrown around willy nilly Let guess covod feta? That’s factors used: ten times less severe, 100 times transmissible. course example would result ten fold difference.  Nobody knows much yet though even said early speculate. know variant one causing recent surge Europe looking it. even know deadly may less dangerous.  second option, outcome grim suggesting. slightly lethal still less 10% lethal. Additionally, although requirement save humanity, slightly lethal variant might encourage people get vaccinated. vaccines contagious can’t transmitted others. Oh true there's one race South Africa! That's known homogenous unified 0 internal conflicts! forget covid already cheated rule thumb infectious symptomatic. Unvaccinated people allowed travel, buy food, even speak unless ask please given vaccine. teach them. shall call it, VACCINE!

Man, brilliant, nobody thought before? Shocking… Buy dip! do, still big impact. new app would produced used much.   Um, think follow logic. Delta dominate variant pretty much everywhere. getting you, always there. might surging area, still Delta. likely already spread everywhere.  remember glorious leader said one day, poof, like magic, it’ll gone! Even bring refrigerated trucks hospitals use makeshift morgues, people live believed hoax. shit probably already Europa speak lmao  No, science catches up. cell vaccines huge Calling ""more"" contagious requires compared something. essentially viral spread one person introduced unvaccinated population, stands reason would spread. already know virus contagious, absence real comparison, can't claim that's contagious variants. Plus already know, Delta necessarily contagious variant that's identified, fit capable spreading. pizza half sauce half cheese y'all need I'll Masking Social Distancing one... can't keep pulling weight unvaxxed social butterflies. last two shots left two days each. really need shit brains writhe pain every six months rest life? Nah - vaccine technology way ahead 2020.

Of course, there's also significant COVID fatigue complience masks lockdowns way down.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Going long winter linked article? Even 1% protection rate miles better 0%. results-derived data. Likely Nu easier time infecting people existing immunities, mean higher R0. However getting interpreted way 500% figure people throwing around. 

It would still mean Nu poised sweep world, know much worse Nu Delta getting infected repeatedly across years. country island, government totalitarian, lockdown ""stop thing"" next impossible.  Drawing conclusions one unvaccinated individual pretty bad way frame dangerous. Young people gotten seriously ill. knows what's 😂 actual virus less lethal mean less people die. variant hospitalizes 50% people slowly variant B hospitalizes 5% people SUPER rapidly, B may end killing people resources taken available help become sick.

It depends real idea variant play yet. Yes I’ve seen couple articles new treatments. that’s happening too, less fanfare. Unclear - take drug X /s I'm hoping that's case. what's happened last scares least. month later packing morgue  wild guess, probably came conjecture looking amount people variant finding amount people vaccinated statistically significant. Wallstreetbets joins chat finally starting sink I'm wrong risk zero. However, want save face I'll make sufficiently small percentage make feel better choices trying maintain footing argument. realize utterly stupid makes look.

That's you. That's sound like. risk much greater one ten million... especially considering recently believed risk zero, likely engaging risky behaviors.

Hope stocked TP! 

/s  

In seriousness though, looking extremely likely Nu really concerning potential. 
It good worrying air travel clamped quickly has.  
I’ll watching case data like hawk (circa March 2020) coming week. Trump pushed bar far indeed. it’s dominate strain it’s late delta still beats likely strain coming didn’t really matter cause it’ll die Ut oh know answer question think glass half full half empty. Precisely. media keeps shortening time variant discovered time start claiming end humanity we're back square one. sheer panic comments result shameless dishonest reporting; they're getting people scared. still absolutely idea variant actually means, point likely disappears way Lambda Mu did. I’m hoping for, worries vastly different everyone’s risk adverse is. feeling seeing restrictions quite governments don’t want get blamed. 

There still young triple vaxxed people threads saying scared go outside. pandemic, there’s mental health break too, it’s getting worse. young woman? really. think vaccines widespread overstating harmful Covid unvaccinated young people (i.e. most, remember football/soccer players caught pre-vaccine barely symptoms) u quickly everyone, let's destroy Belgium's economy!

O no, sorry, forgot Belgium South Africa. idea yet  trying find experts sound apocalyptic sounds like getting biased information Maybe waiting country announce first wouldn’t EU variant going around? Kidding, kind kidding. Guess wedding re-planned won’t happening…again… one scientists developed Moderna vaccine, don’t let fursona distract think misinterpreting bit though. 

The 500% figure derived results, right? Well, Delta competing infect people largely immunities Delta. One reasons Nu taken seriously there's good chance easier time infecting people previously vaccinated otherwise immunized. 
Delta R0=8 unvaccinated population. 

The growth seeing Gauteng around 300% per week implies R cannot less 2.1, cycle length Delta (4.7 days) population immunities. 

Obviously likely immunities affect virus, people likely cautious, but... suspect ignores immunities pretty good extent, getting misinterpreted basal transmission advantage. (It might also one, yeah, 500% sounds unrealistic) want omni subscription. 

Who's kind thing? Americans don’t even know means. “Super” 4th grade reading level material need.

But anomalous great neutral wording. Hong Kong. heard before...? live OK barely even started testing Delta I’d imagine burned population acknowledge it’s here. ""We're putting together team."" patient question young unvaccinated woman

Surprise surprise Precautionary measure =/= big one, bud Exactly. know look for, take long establish Nu since detectable using PCR tests we're already using. quite clearly cause uptick cases. Lol don’t understand decaying factor VIX then. fear mongering worst.

It's absolutely fear mongering, news outlets running wild know works. Look comments jumping ""It's basically early 2020 again"".

Even variant ends dominant that's necessarily bad thing. even know deadly yet.  it.

True less catastrophic OG SARS can't forget possiblility mutating something closer MERS would worst case scenario opinion. would happy mutation ends significantly less harmful point less people require hospitalization wait see. Honestly best case scenario mutation contagious point overtakes dangerous variants less damaging. Im hoping eventually goes way flu could predictable pattern infrastructure actually prepare annual vaccine. little know virology trade per say viruses survive longest tend highly contagious severe enough decimate host population prevent reproduction, many times dice rolled get ever does. True, I’m alarmed barely word variant day ago.  variant going around least two weeks I'd assume. like covid got first detected already spread further. There's always lag infection detection covid Exactly, dealing part world much less reliable data testing. Maybe extremely low numbers reading week ago BS increase isn’t dramatic? FYI current shot protect I’m hearing make sure get booster need you’ll fine. OP comment downvoted hell reason. Reddit. No? Right still next best time. Requiring fully vaccinated people quarantine traveling internationally fucking insane. matter what, variants going get pretty well every country world, even quarantine, we've seen repeatedly. Requiring quarantine punishes people reason. anyone seen anything severe symptoms strain? wise ass lol, seriousness, I'd bet money variant U.S. 

There's lag long takes locate analyze variant activity relative aggressive R0 transmission rate.

Belgium says first sampled variant case came unvaccinated younger woman came back Egypt Nov 11 developed serious flu-like symptoms 11 days later.

On bright side, two Hong Kong cases variants asymptomatic. I'm sure vaccinated not, clear source top comment one Reddit threads new variant. Yes, evasion. Delta’s “power” binds cells (ACE2) better prior variants, replicate faster, particularly nose throat region, antibodies catch catch-up. do, virtually drop-off effectiveness, protection severe illness remained same. Delta runs faster, essentially virus 

This variant, based mutations, potential less likely bond antibodies, true evasion, though yet confirmed, unknown degree. Hence red alert scientists agree. letting covid rip thru classrooms kids instead quaratining exposures inceasing ventilation f mode. restrictions masking f mode. Letting employees work visibly ill f mode. safety net parents whose kids quaratine covid positive making find childcare increases spread f mode. Reduced testing areas high rates f mode. 

I agree 100% nothing. bit collectively even consider shut again. live cases, hospitalization deaths sky rocketing next restrictions behavioral changes anywhere. Covid money gone better ventilation ways say keep quaratined kids school. ""normal"" everywhere. lots sickness death. Thankfully I’m taking family Florida next week, permanently. don’t want around another variant, worse, another virus. early say, people commenting worse possible scenario gather karma. Let’s hope best 1) Make stable lab put covid RNA stable virus 

2) 10% population insane anti vaxxer fanatics ruin everything, want open permament gulags them? also method generates lot plastic waste

3) still safe natural covid, Children die flu every year, society somehow tolerate this, NaTuRaL provide source information? Talk situation good editorial team make massive difference...

Another commenter pointed no, wouldn’t. want make easier pointing makes strain versus variant. Strains significant phenotypic distinctions separate one strain another (think influenza vs B).

There’s music warning us….. read news articles, variant likely mutated individual compromised immune system. say HIV specifically proof that, reasonable guess. claiming existential threat?

Virologists Twitter so, far see careful couch remarks serious concern caveats--because they're professional scientists.

So referring says existential threat? It’s probably true. Vaccines could’ve don’t ability make, ship administer vaccines quickly enough. 

Plus anti-vaccine sentiments, less people likely trust vaccines pandemic drags (wrongly, course.)

People likely take pills injections.

But would wait see nu variant outcompetes delta. hasn’t seemed yet, it’s probably spreading Africa. Lol lighten necessarily. Smallpox basically stats haunted humanity centuries, killing hundreds millions people. Black Death even worse long could keep spreading, selective pressure stop killing people.

I've already given day virus disappears. think keep mutating becoming dangerous day catch automatically die. happens end world know it. dad's breakthrough case like mild cold. make claims. I'm defending integrity good word encouraging people look past purposeful abuse word Western media consider diverse political opinions.

It's word definition stands hope better society. tells reader document outlines author wants see hope achieved. asks reader respond participate public discussions ideas presented. 

Now asked question. Take time need consider answer.

When hear/see word ""Manifesto"" think Manson MLK? Possible likely different things. Anything possible, right now, there's hard evidence variant even vaccine resistance, much less completely resistant, extremely unlikely.

OTOH, social distancing mask wearing effective, chances still see (not sure mean mandates?). efficacy? proof yet boosters rendered significantly less effective? point I’m pretty sure speculation due mutations.  Okay... sick. I'm sure downvoted. pretty reasonable say vaccinated people start get sick die en masse rate unvaccinated people, time worry. shit gonna keep world decides live civilization gets serious vaccine mandates. regurgitate read someone's tool. vaccination rate African countries pretty abysmal? know effective vaccines really starts hitting places. Pfizer Merck announced antivirals shown effectiveness phase 3 trials.  Pfizer's looks great; Merck's meh, neither help anyone they're distributed &amp; used.

FDA needs review data issue EUA's Pfizer Merck need make volume get distributed make difference. variant everything believed be, I'd imagine lot deaths going vaccinated, side political spectrum. will. know one prays orange god lol. Either way would bad, kind hope overblown point. Point. I'm narcissistic pragmatist, much hope lol. Well live here. need get testet it’s fast test getting results, done. ""PCR"" (labor) done needed get negative test earlier quarantine. 

That’s test get deeply testet. I'm sick. Sick it. AAA ever promise 3 day turnaround? kind stuff takes time want done right. true would selective pressure become less lethal would bring us right back today works.

Stopping flights reduces new points exposure - important.

Just house already fire, mean want keep throwing gas it. Well, here's quick glance less deaths per Capita New York, despite way risk people (above age Thanks updating. holding hope wasn’t boosted asymptomatic. It’s definitive way knowing lethality, it’s nice footnote nonetheless  traveling home Cloth mask still 1000x better mask That's different claim. claim else equal, vaccine evading strain outcompete non vaccine evading strain trivial. claim made along lines environment likely induce mutations. Basically smallpox this. R0 3 5 (maybe bit less Delta) IFR 20-30% so. last outbreak Europe Yugoslavia 1972, put via martial law massive mandatory vaccination campaigns. New Covid. Really rolls tongue. There's always israels data graphs vaccine gives protection limited time, time booster may available person extend immunity.

Acting like surprise smug Well, takes time make, ship administer vaccines.

Plus uptake probably going lower people get COVID fatigue start lose confidence vaccines protectiveness wanes.

Our population proven uncapable reasonable, uniform behavior.
We need honest mandate now. dim wit ideas ""pressure"" ppl vaccinate. honest name is. removing everything unvaccinated ppl nothing else mandatory vaccination, honest maybe it’s squeezing left COVID paranoia winter surge isn’t panning bad last year thanks vax natural immunity Chise like post saying pretty clear way control get antivirals onto open market, make affordable promote hell them. 

They hopes Pfizer pills, thus far, look much promising merck option. anyone involved selecting residents:

Rachel Lynn Magliulo, Matthew Shea Willis Kristen Willis Hall three names keep pinned wall individuals suited practice medicine.    say so. One handful cases may still manageable. flights kept coming every day, would impossible enact measures.

What's really important contact tracing immediate quarantine possible contacts. Sorry misrepresented that, 2 doses Pfizer, fully vaccinated May/June so. booster. Please right please please please /r/blackmagicfuckery right there.  Obviously offenders shot virus adapt immune response, also adapt medications designed interfere it. Possibly easily - immune system pretty damn effective.

Also, vaccines extremely safe, small amount needs produced per person. mass administered, antiviral drug would given people actually ill maybe prophylactic immunocompromised.

Personally, expect drugs important manage endemic covid long term, rather stopping currently spiking infection rates.

But expert means. tools certainly better. wary people (not you) would skip vaccine drugs give false sense safety. also doesn’t make “airborn” commenter stated mention analysts suggested starkness market moves might exacerbated thinner trading volumes due U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. markets closed Thursday operate noon Friday  Africa's low vaccination rates there's little selection pressure virus escape immunity conferred vaccine hopefully still works it. vaccine always side effects. isn’t talking camera stating opinion. side effect videos academic merit like stillborn study. going depth about, that’s intellectually honest way go this.

Less scary we'd probably consider another flu, scary we'd react like ebola would beaten it. like evil Goldilocks. ""and vaccine-evading variant ever comes around actually likely emerge highly vaccinated countries."" 

Source? Bingo. better question, allowed to. world got punked delta variant nobody wants happen again. We’re careful past instances necessitate it. many words “we don’t know anything yet 10 mutations” never said  They’re alone I’m reading view. Doomsday variant, comes. either bad news badder news? :(  regurgitating I've reading. concern new 'variant' high probability evade vaccines. Anyway like said time tell take everything read grain salt. heard anyone dying they've identified strain Tuesday, November 23rd. Boosters meant create immediate defensive line infection potential propagation. problem enough people vaccinated causing mutations - means previously vaccinated people need get boosted - we're essentially going circles minority. 

 point, is, must data driven approach, needs dealt reactively based situation ground.

The end goal always cut daily cases becoming severe, cause hospitalization death, burden healthcare system. Let via boosters, OTC medication (hopefully coming soon), testing masks.

The problem see general population reactive impatient, continues inflame pandemic. vaccinate, mask spread good word, even difficult achieve days. federal, state local governments pushing messaging several months people ignore it, believe facebook posts, fb private corp done nothing help propagate misinformation.  American can't travel Europe without vaccine. Maybe requirement everyone flies. OlD PeOpLe

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Mmmhm sure. I’ll believe healthy young people start dying number. let’s freak want booster shot maybe another booster 10 months based delta/nu relevant spike variant. plus everyone either infection immunization should, think, make next winter (and winters thereafter) fairly normal, though probably we'll significant Coronavirus season top influenza season forever. new variant discovered SA SA. probably one many African countries less 10% vaccination rate. presumes adaptation due selective pressure vaccines. 

The reality, though, mutations may well coincidentally something allows escape immunity. mutations happens virus continues spread. literally variant SARS-CoV-2 virus. new virus. start spreading misinformation, really need right now. trying get information new variant Twitter

I think see problem here. European countries Friday joined Singapore, Israel others restricting travel southern Africa frantic effort keep newly identified, apparently significantly evolved, variant coronavirus crossing borders.

In past, governments taken days, weeks months issue travel restrictions response new variants. time, restrictions came within hours South Africa’s announcement — least 10 countries around world announced measures South African scientists finished meeting World Health Organization experts variant Friday.

There proof yet variant could diminish protective power vaccines, uncertainty question one factor speed countries’ move toward restrictions.

The new variant, initially called B.1.1.529, “very unusual constellation mutations,” according Tulio de Oliveira, director KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation Sequencing Platform. protein helps create entry point coronavirus infect human cells, new variant 10 mutations, many dangerous Delta variant, Professor de Oliveira said. I'm bit south, moved Connecticut year. say people incredibly nice good natured comparison.  Kind refreshing disagree still treated like human beings.

Have great weekend know we’re already hoping best. Look European countries, data new variant yet, lockdowns waning immunity.  Frankly think cycle new variants new mrna vaccines/boosters rolled one side ""wins"". knows long take... takes 10 different boosters five years... yeah, I'm thrilled I'm willing get means eventually dies out. Well house pretty much every day lockdowns started anyone point gun UK. blows mind dont send poorer countries matter cost. Whatever cost far cheaper another economic hit lockdowns furlough's pills speak of? wait. If, huge point, variant bad seems might be, we're going get object lesson death 1,000 cuts. Labor shortages already huge problem. supply chain becoming increasingly snarled up, creating shortages higher prices. divisiveness violence we've already seen vaccines, masks lockdowns going become exponentially worse tee another round nightmare. 

There point center can't hold anymore... good know. Hopefully mild symptoms, any. sincere hope current vaccines still provide robust enough immune system response keep vast majority people safe serious health issues. person clearly never heard 1918 flu pandemic lasted whole 2 years killed 25-50 million people black death basically wiped estimated 200 million people. first pandemic we've last article saying experiments underway. 30 mutations spike protein concerning, many permutations still allow infection human cells. reason, vaccine still effective degree. Whether degree sufficiently high protect people question. Higher 70% effective goalpost tossed around vaccines first came out. ??? country already worse shape ever was. Seems Delta currently. Likely soon vaccines wane more. Key quote:

Yes, Covid going end. eventually become endemic. really don’t think understand isn’t one bad, next. It’s essentially certainty. We've seen things before. understand point trying make, directional decision making useful, give best accurate picture. don’t know give gold, know made day. sound snarky all. person little overly defensive IMO. hand, reports suggest spike proteins variant differ current vaccines designed protect against. Think communication breakdown here.... Infection chance infection severity two different metrics look at. current vaccine reduces delta older strains. new variant mutated bypass vaccine's reduction infection CHANCE. However, enough data say whether variant also bypasses vaccine's reduction infection SEVERITY.
The ""best"" case scenario would vaccine still effective reducing infection severity new variant, time (and science) tell.
So words, bad recently boosted person got infected recently boosted person getting severely sick. Pls get vaccinated. dont take medical help get sick COVID understand listening scientists, virus mutations tend favor contagiousness severity symptoms survival virus reliant contagious deadly is. found pretty interesting. Depends entirely go. typical western-tourist centric beach hotel curated excursions see pyramids? low risk (setting aside corona). number mutations make difference though; mutations equal dangerous. emergency meetings likely name accused inaction, fact matter would far better over-react turn another Lambda, nothing become real problem. point, little data pointing critical emergency.  Horse medication curing covid19 come? bald guy says worked  Hong Kong cases also fully vaccinated Pfizer. one spread other. vaccinated vaccinated transmission, airborne. Okay, tell me, happens completely ignore lockdowns? Deadlines also depends fast spreads wave big hospitals colapse death rate go lot. Hey, I’m making mistakes. saw breakthrough cases variant. We've seen someone get face eaten Velociraptors. know literal, perspective important. Hope so, friend. Good luck us, directly Portugal! infectious big red flag. virus infects, chance mutate we've seen Delta whatever variant is. mutates longer incubation time without side affects turns ramps deadly worst worlds. best bet try eradicate mutates. antivaxxers seem hell bent letting happen. happened literally nobody. even paid businesses trouble shutting wish people would point frequently talking variant. 23 November, South Africa reporting +/-300 cases day. Three hundred.

Of course new variant took numbers low. variant extremely contagious. transmitted Hong Kong two people quarantine hotel rooms across hall other, otherwise contact other. firends symptoms 10 days catching Delta. similar period time. Haha, yes- take Nobel prize!!! I’ve lived 5 different countries 50. Pretty big bubble. Keep telling poor people need charity rich, instead systemic change. guy Hong Kong, asymptomatic. careful separate testing positive actually getting sick, two things necessarily equivalent. saw thousands people lose livelihoods work, did, they'd get fined, pay they'd get arrested, resisted arrest, they'd get shot.  ""contain"" degree, keep carrier that's one outbreak avoid, possible patients call work sick &amp; visit ICU help keep things normalish till better grasp &amp; updated vaccine ready. think vaccine prevent getting covid help die Single data points, indeed, necessarily indicate trend.

But one see someone get face eaten Velociraptors, reassuring. Optomistic, flawed. enough data make sort concrete conclusion Isn’t fun living knees? America lost balls don’t see power play. Get ready vaccines policies required order enjoy regular freedoms. 5 million 7.7 billion people died Covid 2 years. 1 million deaths common flu last 2 years. dont see counters points, course scientists concerned, variant spread lot. doesnt mean panic mode super worried put everything back square 1. Perhaps maybe understand things enough know people quick say covid wont major threat forever. say things like ""no pandemic last forever "" (I know that's technically true) something similar like person responded to. like said, flu? still Spanish flu strains here. flu kills tens thousands people every year US. Maybe jut another virus kill hundreds thousands people every year going forward now. 

What exactly preventing happening? someone says ""vaccines"", yes know. clear vaccines alone enough stop virus plus millions people never take it. Also we're witnessing today always threat variant evades vaccines.

I dunno, I'm hard time visualizing world covid always surging, always producing new variant, always killing least tens thousands, possibly hundreds thousands people every year something like full fledged cure take point become infected. UK put red list - isn’t advisory - direct flights banned hotel quarantine restarts Sunday - non British / Irish / residents cannot enter country SA (or 5 countries added red list) previous 10 days. Anectodal evidence worthless Arblus look, it’s Omicron! case Belgium clear chain transmission back South Africa. already escaped Africa. Sounds like want get accused taking seriously. Seems strange move straight VoC virtually non-existent data point time.  Legit read list mutations morning ran lab model it, thing insane. New variant lot mutations variants concern have, bundled together mutations aswell. Analogous increased transmission delta, compared alpha wild virus, saw higher viral load early infection. means mucosa lot virus particles, hence easier transmission.

A lot studies linked article: Yes no. worked health service since start pandemic formally qualified, generally rule...

You always want less severe disease, least disease capable badly impacting high risk categories. Ebola, example, cause global panic deadly - actually less deadly, therefore able spread without burning infectious group quickly. 

A virus want kill host. insentive to. reason common cold evades us easily due little effect host also easily spreadable is. 

The problem infect people easily. happens chance hit risk, especially many places stepped many covid restrictions.

A deadly strain apparent knocks host within days may go 100 people, less deadly strain takes host notice disable sickness may go 1000. strain that's deadlier kills 10% 100 takes 10, one less infectious spread 1000 kill rate 5% takes 50. problem.

It happened Delta. 

Thank god system designed get vaccines quickly safely. curriculum taught Buddha nature suffering behaviors lead end suffering lifetime remember anti-lockdown people said every time COVID-19 thing would seem control, there'll new variant push control general public taking away rights? Glad good time! Hull fair? Hopefully one everyone goes space, that's probably gonna COVID 6 so. Time travel probably COVID 8. backwards. First form opinion, decontextualize verses support it. Vrrrr Omicron-Persei 8 Yet need Delta, would need variant? bar high yet clear it. still know lot things regarding variant transmissibility/severity. I'm suddenly flashbacks childhood 70s. Thanks input. way I've leaning. I'm Canada issues initial vaccine rollout. That's important consideration thought before, appreciate mentioning it.

Just record, I'm personally eligible booster yet, parents shortly - likely data vaccine efficacy vs nu available.  kind envy guy degree.  Imagine living way look away problem disappears. like baby never learned object permanence. January 2020 already know can't lock humanity months end. fit variant, find way matter do.   Wait Omega variant Keeping boosters wearing masks indoors around new strangers horrible ask; people return sense normalcy abiding precautions. makes everything sound negative; think world ending needed wear condoms avoid HIV eat raw eggs avoid salmonella.  Didn’t post heavily downvoted? pointed previous comment extremely rough estimate based extremely rough estimate transmissibility. seriously doubt 500x number heard going stick, wait see. there's evidence contrary either right? simply wait couple weeks data jumping conclusions?  Maybe sequence new variant, way ever promise re-develop vaccine timeframe. wonder ""less deadly"" newly identified (just identified Tuesday) lot data track yet. Obviously hope that's case, think people transmit it, higher deaths rise. 

The average age Africa 20, hits US full obesity, co-morbid conditions, older population, could bad news. Elaborate? health experts Friday cautioned alarm said would take time assess potential impact variant there's evidence existing COVID-19 vaccines continue Isaac Bogoch, infectious diseases specialist Toronto, urged Canadians get vaccinated already.* addition, said discovery new variant shows importance ensuring everyone world access vaccine, variants originate among unvaccinated people.*

Well, may bring horror vaccinated shows still need rush vaccinate still take jab. That's definitely name virus b list action movie us already. seen stated anywhere person unvax? vax unvax catch spread. Africa low vax rates 3rd world, can't blame eithier. varient replaces delta vax work well it. Go get booster today tomorrow. Given covid waves work 3 months varent specific booster available already peaked current one. Monica Gandhi painfully wrong time, would never use source.

No, southern hemisphere it'll summer. Israel literally ran wargame playing scenario. sure wish didn’t say first part. many potential epitopes ~1300 bp spike protein (*obviously accessible surface, still lots are) I’m sure 3 vaccinations immune system made antibodies tons them. Could 30 epitope changes defeat it? Sure maybe. likely? little. risks saying “vaccines don’t work” publicly far outweigh better statement like “we don’t evidence yet infect vaccinated individuals delta does”. able know quickly, easier detect Delta Happened Brasil. No, fucking isn’t. one wants lose lung capacity, energy anything, brain function. many things go wrong hospitalization death. never dealt chronic condition clearly.

This virus already ruin life. see long Covid sufferers went able run marathons basically able walk stairs they’re energy.

I’m tired ableist crap. doesn’t roll tongue like Delta does. needs better marketing team. /s  market cares none that… positive energy southern US

are making spirit bomb Uhh thats generally healthy. unhealthy problems. Delta doesn’t fly JNB DTW. engineered behave outrageously

Like humans? Feigl start Covid pessimistic Covid seriously spoke Covid farts N95 underwear. incredibly weird 5% tested positive 28% first dose, Delta cases flat.

But vaccination/immunity rate really matter here. Omicron outcompeting Delta factor 3-5x per week Johannesburg data claims, either data wrong Omicron bad news. Speculating whether due evasion prior immunity increased contagiousness people talk about, even though far *always* mostly increased contagiousness small side immune evasion.

In long run, increased contagiousness worse evasion. measles-like level contagiousness immunity last lifetime could see *lot* annual infections. Long term care facilities full right now. full ICUs partly many people “survived” covid permanently ventilators, bed-bound, dependent 24/7 care. people tracheostomies PEG tubes breathe eat fully conscious. lay shit pee clean them. want call survival, fine. Omicron. **Omni**cron Decepticon. :D

Although I've already seen local news websites misspell name. it’s odds doctors follow. 

Sounds like saying research. makes perspective invalid because...? zero doubt antivirals save many lives.

I skeptical much hospital capacity people think/as ideally should. Correct, learn nothing. Trump everyone blamed (I sure did) biden does, shall see handles it. shit, get ASAP clue ultimately. solution? Ya travel take chances PANDEMIC. yes, quarantine country (either ours) 2+ weeks assure virus free. happen? maybe. loopholes allowing people quarantine faster? always is. ya fail too. Yes covid deniers mostly people reasonable amongst misinformation spread wrong. COVID huge problem them. vaccines much less effective, vaccine logistics terrible economy based exports imports, local spending. cannot isolate world years expect good things happen. really dangerous us. like say there’s little difference ignorance confidence. Even without new covid markets real spooky. Supply chain jams, ridiculous labor issues, unsustainable housing inequality etc etc. hear you.

But lot people regularly take meds make feel terrible regular basis benefits overall health. Methotrexate knocked day every week it. benefit still worth it.

I think new vaccine booster every two months unrealistic development standpoint, may need get used idea may need booster every 6 months year. possible.   talk fact international travel allowed?

RemindMe! 1 month so? Yes -Caution warranted paranoia. going many variants next years till substantial portion world vaccinated (or) effective anti viral treatments mean, obviously? people really think variants localized time detection global society? Ksee. must reason viruses evolve month long incubation times, probably hard contagious symptoms appear. easy we'd probably dead already. way, viruses larger organisms kind balance talking it. damaged lung capacity give week everybody Yeah really would like know outcome patients far nothing. Sounds like important information know amazes moronic answer. First, ability pull data point (I assume, body cavity one sort another) incredibly monoric paralyzing. 100% nothing, everything else useless. Wow. Incredible, even internet standards. record setter sort, sure. Then, ability take absurdly moronic initial assumption seriously enough go 5 paragraphs made-up consequences. takes dedication. 

Whenever comes avoid personal rsponsability, human ability mental contortionism is... _beyond_. What? remember people saying 5+ variants completely right. yes. help understanding, antibodies react right away cells take time activate. Probably uses different protein enter cells. Exactly, handled badly idea they're punished absurd. I’m arguing either way, feel like know jack shit point, one point I’ve seen makes sense layperson brain it’s really good news it’s spreading while. that’s case hospitalizations/deaths haven’t dramatically increased, it’s good indication isn’t doomsday variant. Well yes. Meh say you. left go anywhere felt safer feel way returning home US. want US citizens stuck months, potentially years? Yeah no. Test them, get plane, shut shit wow that's pretty racist ""If going make us money next 24 hours. We're it."" Exactly. could made worse. Europe kept planes tarmac even let travelers terminal. Thanks. Keep fighting good fight! variant potential worse pops up, travel locked immediately evaluated following weeks investigated. 0 reason let violent run rampant becomes impossible contain know bad is. Monday late? do? It’s going choose avoid infecting people get plane then.   asking question…? please.just stop bullshit already. liberals would year ago proper immunity. Sure people would die vast majority drains society anyways. Good lord, take look Australia. muh fox news muh republicans. everything Biden handled this. think people protesting Australia fox news told to? Fuck no, authoritarian measures government taken try make people want do. thing happened Bidens vaccine mandate. Fox news nothing pissed people are. one need news outlet tell feel Biden announced mandate, knew. 

And there's possibility vaccine stop variant would mean taking vaccine would almost pointless people. say would stopped creation new variants, would theoretically true, originated Africa. entire population Africa never vaccinated within next 100 years. Someone take look Madagascar. experiencing coinciding surge appears occurred simultaneously South Africas, similar exponential scale, similarly low vaccination rates. They're also geographically countries list 14-day change see Madagascar pop 2nd place position right South Africa. reduce them, much would help (you find Wikipedia stopping rate Delta original strain (and maybe others)).

So, if, let's say, 90% effective hospitalization (a number made up), means everyone vaccinated, 10% people needing hospitalization volume need now. would definitely stop hospitals overloaded. Measles roughly twice infectious. Measles basically one infectious diseases planet. thought issue hard evidence either direction. that's case, statement technically true. IMO makes sense prepare worst case scenario know. There's major difference idiotically brave bravely idioctic. Maybe I’m reading wrong, seems doesn’t cause dementia? Sorry, bit messy wording, saying 'Nope' ""nope, missing anything"", I'm agreement. tried sorts therapy medication, work. Magic mushrooms illegal country, adds impetus fact would much better developed country. even cares? new seasonal flu mutated again, whoop de doo leave borders open? Honestly Fuck media. I'm getting vaccinated protecting within reason lockdowns media fear mongering creating panic need be. know pretty much nothing new variation I'm willing bet ends big deal like 50 others. Ideas problem … one probably 10000 Reddit full depressed people looking info helps justify shitty outlook life offload misery onto others. 

Trusting commenter nearly anything insanity. Go get booster grandpa! ;)  mean isn’t literally exact situation Biden criticized trump China travel ban? missing something 

And btw voted Biden anyone thinks I’m trump troll lol Yeah, that's baseline condition. shit. Window let people nothing ultimately. people learn history. high vaccination rate think would required herd immunity? Covid farts? Wtf? freaking equal denying COVID. Lmao

It feel like days Dems called racist shut Nancy pelosi told people go China town😂😂 cope!  ""Failed state"" specific commonly recognised term geopolitics. Google it. Case numbers increasing majorly Gauteng. 90% positive cases last days there. Last week less 30%.

2173 today. 1980 yesterday. 1018 Wednesday. Everywhere else cases relatively flat.

Hospitalizations Gauteng quadrupled last days, test positivity rates shot up.

NICD detected 10k variants, variants special, garnered real response. B.1.1.529 different many measures, response South Africa discovering variant, South Africa first identify variant breaking locally appears serious. name Transformer Starting Monday. Opposite fast Actually, look back Ebola hit, people didn’t believe certain countries Africa. believed government trying scare them, didn’t think bad. think common phenomenon people go denial. research, protests controversy. Humanity loosing virus.

This fucking biologically statistically predictable, thus avoidable, due weak politicians avoiding unpopular measures plain stupidity selfishness part people, goes following natural course.

 2 spotted black plague, related Anthrax runs death rate 50 60%

3 pneumonic plague kills 80% 

4 septicaemic plague always fatal


The estimated death rate big plague period 1348-1351 ranged 40 50% traditionally,however recent years medical medieval specialists coming MD side PhD side iirc revised upwards 50-65%.

It might given time, obviously anything it.  English pretty wide vocabulary words describe less developed parts world. ""Failed"" imply catastrophic collapse-- failure really spectrum. Racist trash.  We're talking deadly viruses pandemic here. significant reduction spread coming preventing risks collaborates situation worsen. That’s xenophobic Even doesn’t evade vax/immunity, it’s likely infectious delta…that’s getting measles territory(or worse)

We could well start seeing mass spread events OUTDOORS. think hospitals strained now, wait. Assuming even half bad say. it’s plus immune dodge. don’t even want speculate. mutate REAL variant though? /s call winning. 

Too many people still waiting vaccines. many people rejecting vaccination, even privilege choosing vaccine get. way virus replicating mutating infinity beyond. 

We still see dice roll turns 40 beds survival rate extremely low able admit despite vaccinated vs sick young vaccinated survival rate high admit vaccinated. illegal variant come planet Omicron Persei 8 ?? would seem good news, sort? test still reliably detects variant COVID, actually way makes identifiable spot rather lengthier round sequencing. main thing we're infected ignorance.

And microplastics least warm I'm disappointed though. follow could ""classic"" bet 89% unvaccinated, high risk population. Probably control proper treatment, especially modern medical technology Maybe airport. Seems likely Omicron

That confused minute two. thought calling one Nu.  Seems that's changed last hours. also overlook hospitals serious staffing issue currently. Decades treating rank file disposable replaceable, laying off/firing tons pandemic elective procedures hold campuses running low census... 

It's culminated huge amount nurses RTs leaving field.

I'm even counting dumbass antivax ones. never healthcare begin with. europe too? there. US Monday. bet Australia closes border soon. Always long winter Canada embarrassing comment making far pandemic. Either willfully ignorant, trolling, plain dumb helped. YEAH! think people fully realize long term exactly happen. SA even justify action know even came country. still following scientific guidelines masking socially distancing correct? based timeline comments, almost time another booster... want make sure still fully protected bit actually. certain extent masks useless according science. example N95s really mask worth anything delta variant, delta pass immediately though almost cloth based masks. Also, overwhelming majority people wearing masks correctly

Proper medical guidance states wear “new” clean every time place one on. touch mask hands reuse mask without sterilizing it. Similarly, masks need nose. Even people masks nose often skip “fresh mask every time it’s face”

There’s reason Fauci gone “masks don’t work” “wear masks” “we take masks fully vaccinated” “wear two masks!” “two masks protection necessary” “two masks ideal solution”

Masks prevent disease. it’s nowhere near effective people media think not? unvaccinated give rights society. Well Trump's travel ban China anything least we'll somewhat fewer unvaccinated blacks pouring communities. second point vaccine escape discussed, it’s early tell. Pfizer Moderna running tests take 2 weeks know. Google “Pfizer new strain” choose news today choice source. Let's hope turns nothing-burger. restricting travel may help that. 

End game? (and many countries apparently) want take every measure possible stop new threat. anti-that? IMO seems pretty inexcusable someone living EU country plenty vaccines hand. I'm even bothered fact allowed travel internationally. raises many red flags.  Nobody hates US US It’s hard positive anymore also said everyone believes dickhead. that's truth. agree. Plus added benefit less migration African countries. Beginning Monday? There’s point even Australia seems ignoring it. Great :(. Borders still open SA. it? Man, *wish* could ignore covid, end result would soon also mean ignore influenza, measles, tuberculosis, heart disease, cancer, car accidents, drownings, lightning strikes, every immediately fatal eventually fatal disease whether likely unlikely 6 months year entire healthcare system collapsed trying deal it. People would refuse go work. whole society would grind halt, point ""lockdowns"" would seem like mild disruption comparison.

It *can't* ""ignored"".  crons disease? im sorry… almost sounds worse point unvaccinated 

How fuck people still dense unvaccinated? Totally agree. perfectly Frank, enough unvaccinated Africans already know mean. Unicron  think it’s profit thing messes Ah, okay. Yeah remember would need Delta control make sense.

And problem letter Xi? similar case USSR 1960. Smallpox brought Moscow artist traveling India. vaccinated 9.5mln people within 10 days date figured smallpox. Afaik won’t issue, comes animals still spreading it. reading something day   Yes it’s effective measure. begins.

Fuck. probably would've magically gone away like Trump wished 100% world wide vaccination rate now...and yet don't, are... joke falls flat add /s thing disappointed decided call ""Nu"", ""new"". 

After studying month, still might rename COVID-21 vaccinated healthy lmao Keep moving on, Edit: wear masks. Turned re-skinned third party there's thing going around might able help still making logical sense here. might think they're bad person getting shot - makes elderly mother worthy care much less life live? Logically makes sense give hospital bed unvaccinated 30 year old, someone go back work getting released contribute economy welfare country decades compared elderly person. turning bleeding heart issue, logically makes sense save bedpot elderly mother Sure right call going help ton. already know Egypt Belgium. going lock well?

Yep, one material base whole cilivization way life) fact varient something HIV, covid discovered latent human body really concerns me. either airborne AIDS last potential covid spike may lead cure + better understanding HIV/AIDS. Assuming many mutations varient covid acquired mutation frequency strengths HIV. likelihood getting lower (I think 80-90% efficacy delta). get spread it, you’re far less likely to. I respectfully disagree - vaccine mediated immunity works. 

1. Vaccines virus antibiotics bacteria alike. exert selection pressure pathogen, antibiotic static, force bacteria change, do, antibiotic cannot change respond kind. Vaccine-mediated immunity, hand, versatile dynamic. shift antibody type quantity response changes virus, creating immune response always custom-tailored. process called ""antibody affinity maturation."" process works natural infections well, vaccine give head start. one reasons vaccines, made Wuhan original spike, still work quite well new variants like Alpha Delta.  
 
2. vaccines put damper virus' ability mutate, see ""COVID-19 vaccines dampen genomic diversity SARS-CoV-2: Unvaccinated patients exhibit antigenic mutational variance"" think vaccine clear infection quickly give virus less time mutate. idea virus evolve resistant vaccinated hosts supported actual data. South Africa got plenty Vaccine. can’t get population get vaccinated.

‘South Africa's vaccination programme slowed recent months - lack supplies, due public indifference.’

New Covid variant: South Africa's pride punishment sarcasm right? that’s true Every report saying need panic need data. new variant that’s transmissible news whether like though. hoped delta wouldn’t big deal too. think South Africa much bigger things worry travel ban. They're fking dealing actual fking virus exploding. stop ""travel ban hurt poor widdle countries"" nonsense? We're dealing worst human event decades need whatever fk mitigate it. someone never seen car before? Yes, I'd call normal . 

Unknown things scary. scary normal. 

Covid mutations thing riding car.   problem argument places, like India, Israel American south, also low COVID prevalence Delta wave subsided. question whether variant trigger new wave get around immunities. word yet sequenced lot countries, effect vaccinations also take longer suppose. hope turn worse. really need stop letting Twitter talking heads, even ones paper seem smart, dictate discourse.

Sounds like thing kill. I’m fully vaccinated looking get booster, thing going deadly, feel like depression anxiety kill instead.  Booster good people also masking indoors. Baragwanath hospital variant likely prevalant :

\-35% partially vaccinated  think lockdown, isolate vaccinate 65 leave everyone age alone? Check. Goes nicely car bots starting show up. mostly fact test afresh, time variant concern might changed dramatically. make sense tiny increase efficacy. unvaccinated problem, overload ICUs hospitals.

If everyone vaccinated, happen. hear you. We’ve dealing scenario States. lockdowns. mask mandates. watched helplessly cases rose hospitals overwhelmed- oxygen supplies ran low bodies piled up. And, hoped wouldn’t accident needed life death care we’re turned away due lack care.

Retailers travel-centric businesses looking normal holiday season last year’s pandemic-imposed slump, investors concerned resurgent virus could unwind recent economic progress. SIUUUUU Yes certainly isn’t South Africa rough conditions could breed deadly variant South Africa could neighboring African nation simply hasn’t means sequence gene well testing contact tracing. would odd culprit/country origin somewhere far outside area first reported. Someone said originated Botswana possible doesn’t seem confirmed. epidemiologists saying started South Africa, investigate contract tracing first confirmed positive cases, I’d take word. need defend claims South Africa that’s foreign governments saying Yep That's theory that's hypothesis. Basically meaningless. could hypothesize mutated extra terrestrial would useful.  really got news new variant like yesterday. can't bring new vaccine overnight even mRNA. pfizer said they're keeping close eye see whether new vaccine needed. can't bring vaccines variants even exist yet well.

As Delta boosters. Well current vaccines shown work extremely well Delta. main real issue waning immunity around 6 months. Hence use original vaccine booster we've seen boosters restores efficacy. Creating whole new vaccine exactly fix waning immunity since need long term data on. feels like February 2020 again. issue game mutations magically affect every living organism/virus time reality-breaking aspect game. variant start 0 competitive variants also vying reproduce host. know talking strategy game conflating functionality way reality missing actual science long long way. Flights halted before, germany different danger categories country, high one mutation zones. Delta response response covid first spread slow, quick response reasonable help gain time. later act less reasonable approach. lot things know yet, therefore wise act cautiously. things concerning: fast spread country seen low numbers past weeks, high amount previously recovered/vaccinated infected many mutations, already know concerning variants bundled together one. wait weeks gather data (biontech expecting 2 weeks gather data vaccine reduced efficacy) already late. Then, really doesnt make sense close flights. early on, even cases already slipped through, makes sense.  Came see US Covid slowly getting better.

Saw there’s new variant whatever that’s faster people claiming going like 2020, worse.

And goes anxiety. Unless learn clone mass-produce qualified ICU staff, much help. Equipment bottleneck places, doctors/nurses are. Good thing made stockpile N95 masks everyone. actually meant. 

It's 50% country never stopped going out, bars, stopped partying. live Canada opposition parties provincial governments begging federal ban flights South Africa… funny part is? direct flights two countries.

I feel like we’re South Park episode.  worry furry Twitter says probably fine Variant lot mutations. 30 vs deltas 2

500x transmissible(probably high) someone said would contagious virus history

Possibily ignores body’s immune response

Some twitter people think it’s 8x mortality rate(way soon know that)

Should know two weeks lab tests. Right -- disagree this. good pump brakes bit, though understand impulse people already wearied Delta try stop next big thing infancy rather doomed fail ​impotently later.

I'm bit frustrated casually people saying ""fear-mongering media."" ""the media"" (which monolith anyway) made call emergency meetings this, ordered policy-makers multiple countries issue statements declaring closing borders tightening restrictions whatever.

There boogyman -- multiple groups tired people responding still-evolving data. definitely dispiriting same, hope turns false alarm. pharma already dickswinging quickly human trials/roll new vaccines. 1000$ second profit must slowing down. Well, seems like Nu development hate people much. world could avoided whole covid thing intitled assholes find self-control stay home get vaccinated. got USA running around like virus next existed nurses going bars pandemic. 

People fucking suck Thing vaccination negative result never 100% proposition. need quarantine. since know lot people listen understand this, quarantine enforced work. think Australia New Zealand ended using regular military enforcement order get right kind cooperation. excess death US March. virus wasn’t circulating 2019, period, sure “for sure spreading” comes one google search away. Incredible speed it.  ultimately circles us back Healthcare workers *suffering* choices (mostly) unvaccinated.  

I still choose factor equation all. 
It's choice, I'm upset it. 

Everyone right see extended family, not.  choice not. share source. Regurgitation bad enough, regurgitation without citation even worse. That's like best case scenario, right? dominant strain mild reduces level flu/cold, missing something? People want lock ton measures mindset people afraid flying one fly. someone’s afraid flying either get drive. don’t shut country people unreasonable fears test couple weeks see big impact thanksgiving gatherings cases week later hospitalization numbers. Hopefully doesn’t would feel confident going gathering unvaccinated right now. It’s going find anyone unvaccinated eventually. since March getting boostered couple weeks Christmas it’s open everyone. still wear mask everywhere go don’t trust anyone. needed reminder. makes say 8 years? Completely illogical close borders. always been. case supporting WHOs stance. people correct, punished diligent. Instead punching down, western countries getting 3rd world vaccinated. Funny sudden variant starting found everywhere. nations starting sequence variant spreading aready?  winning move play Yep thought Austria typed word “most”. seem exception right hope stays way. planning trips Europe really research reacted restrictions gauge risk tolerance. risk tolerance UK Austria like night day. think Germany fine though seems like full lockdown table, definitely hope right enjoy much deserved fun trip friend.  It'll happen one day. monumentally fucked. spreading region South Africa. cases variants much competition spreading. Still needs study, early tell actual transmission rate effectiveness current vaccines towards it. LMAO No, scientists quite reasonable. They're saying concerning, enough data tell serious new strain is, they're working furiously find out. journalists ones taking running it.

Quote Nature [press 
""So far, threat B.1.1.529 poses beyond South Africa far clear, researchers say. unclear whether variant transmissible Delta, says Moore, currently low numbers COVID-19 cases South Africa. “We’re lull,” says. "" Yeah escalated fast today, yet medical professionals cautiously optimistic seems. Storm teacup next big nightmare, roll dice…  kills high probability, matter first 14 days asymptomatic. Drastic measure taken. burnout.

Deadlier variants also kills antivaxers faster less hesitant people. people take seriously friend/relative die it.

Optimal strategy Covid virus much deadly. contagious. NOBODY reporting girl Belgium wasn’t, still infected vaccinated. show milder symptoms many times merry go round gonna continue people realize you’re sold pork pies too.. pandemic completely destroyed every single facet life.. smiled even last 10 months.. I've lost desire live.. Also note two vaccinated Hong Kong citizens showing symptoms infected. said themselves: case need alter formula quickly first charges significant numbers need 100 days produced.  didn’t originate South Africa though. first found Botswana Time buy cheap stocks then!  talk 6 weeks / 100 days deliver new versions vaccine tbh it’s 100 days delta don’t believe adapted formula countering one strain.

With first strain vaccine supposed prevent infection spread, delta it’s hospitalisation death. would hope they’d work updated version booster example targeting delta.  would cancel, unless getting stuck another country cool you. giving covid totally cool much wrong completely unrealistic impossible, even everyone comply would still household transmission, essential workers. would never extinguish Haven’t found handful news outside Africa. I’m sure there’s haven’t sequenced tested published. Nu would really terrible name it, say ""Nu-variant"" sounds like ""new variant"" would non-stop confusion 

""which new variant?"" 

""No, Nu-variant.""

""What- oh mean South Africa one newer one?"" reading wayyy many threads/Twitter posts this, really wonder medical community overreacting underrating Delta. seem like don’t want make mistakes again. 

However, seems like *maybe* cases mild. media making seem like it’s end world. pandemic destroyed career, social life, mental health, confidence, finances, basically everything! kill already! -_- New variant showed people ultra scared. company nicest office I've ever seen. people work fantastic, including management.

I still never wanna go back working office lol sad, hey long give up, that's matters. I'm Jersey, full vaxed + booster still mask up, wash hands, stay away crowded indoor settings. government effectively nationalize providing free everyone.

And generally give less two hoots corporate profit, companies actually created parts vaccine actually relatively small.

If spent whole career working towards designing one things, set essentially next revolution branch medicine secure financial professional future, would keen people saging ""just give ot away!""? cases Hong Kong vaccinated.

Where getting information?  variant thought able evade immunity. likelihood getting severe disease may increased spreads. Bloom Labs Twitter saying pills target coronavirus generally, spike protein specifically. Vaccines lower transmission 40%, can't really blame unvaccinated. developed countries, mutation likely originate vaccinated person. absolute rubbish take. It’s still reducing hospitalizations deaths high risk 65+ cohort form 22% 3% (see page 36): matters!  Selective memory then. tested. soar throat? Reinfection uncommon far first infection.  care one stock begin with.  Well yeah. market based prediction. 

Predicting company well, predicting future needs, predicting future laws etc ^ this.

Just domestic spread, mean still want introducing new points spread.

There truly appalling attitudes display right now.  Ok Thank you! thought evade existing immunity. It’s unclear effectively spreads. anyone know particular woman's sample tested new variant? random? b/c travel Egypt? Belgium ahead game genome testing? Curious fits much spread really there. bird flu evolves transmission covid.. game over. CFR around 20% Wow..chilling Pfizer’s Paxlovid sounds less scary (doesn’t encourage virus mutation) 

They'd probably mutually reinforce. Mutation scary already covid risk, might still want it. Yeah, nothing happen (I’m American) Austrian lockdown hasn’t inspired lot confidence. I’m hopeful you’re correct! worse exactly? Everything speculation point  Transmissibility decreases mortality increases, I’m sure lack spreading quickly previous variants would next counterpoints people politicizing rather approach public health issue read tha Delta OG COVID-19 mutation spikes, i.e. ""hands"" grab onto us.

…No. [The spike protein little aren’t “more spikes.” Mandatory 14 quarantines vaccinated individuals test negative overly cautious best ridiculous worst. There's nothing suggest new variant produces false negatives AFAIK. I’m pretty much done international travel whole - except Canada. don’t want get stuck another country - pandemic risks also climate change effects manner things. love travel, think find enough diverse experiences explore US scratch itch. Yeah one blow sure.  People like reason covid still thing South Africa. Gene sequencing positive samples. end, way people expect to. go away, continue mutations population continue build resistance either vaccinations infections, point virus either highly transmissible deathly catastrophic extremely unlikely reach point virus becomes something akin flu; seasonal, annoying most, dangerous vulnerable manageable annual vaccination like flu population go lives little worry. 

The reason mandates, lockdowns restrictions try manage infections got point, eliminate people would cooperate would less severe shorter duration. sizable population across globe refuse take basic preventive measures mask wearing, abide lockdown restrictions refuse get vaccinated. continue cycles increasing restrictions, lockdowns overflowing hospitals.

It’s likely variant already spread across globe need hope current vaccines provide level protection variant doesn’t prove transmissible deadly that’s case back square one (think beginning 2020). Fortunately mRNA vaccines tweaked address new variants trying get everybody revaccinated challenge. disagree healthcare. would require nationalization essentially R&amp;D that.

Do really want progress whims people like government -- previous current? topics would limited. funding would limited.  South Africa ideal place pop terms evaluating severity. highly unvaccinated population largely escaped Delta variant. Nu came relative absence variants, data right really tell us much it'll affect highly vaccinated population one Delta dominant even exclusive variant circulation.

But what's encouraging guy Hong Kong tested positive asymptomatic, unvaccinated lady Belgium way Egypt mild symptoms unvaccinated previously infected. data points right indicate increased severity. Happy Cake Day! get serious getting vaccine poor countries. vaccine protects getting COVID plenty well. data boosted encouraging. Remember covid overhyped

Was though ? figured Genau diese Denkweise ist das Problem, warum wir aktuell krass gefickt werden current vaccines work variant, we'll lucky. fucking fuck talking about?

Wonder whats going I'm virologist working related field, take following huge grain salt:

Whenever COVID novel virus, scientists looked virus transcribed genetic makeup organism sequence exclusively unique SARS-CoV-2. organism sequence. simplifed form, think binary code computer program bunch 0's 1's. viral sequence known properly written down, contents added shared database accessed virologists world-wide. someone sick assumed COVID, test like PCR determine RNA contains bits virus RNA (that sequenced database) comparing one other.

Now, different variants share genetic ""base"" structure first encoded sequence vary certain areas sequence. Using computer metaphor again, could assume original SARS-CoV-2 sequence looked something like binary: 10000101001 (made simplified). suspected new variant found, compared code see differs original. varies, new variant. analysis needs check exactly differs change may cause humans.

About tests: think PCR tests laboratories identify variants testing, reasons go head.

In state, nothing changed since Delta came along.

Damnit. cannot catch break we? people calling idea crazy I'm putting money we're seeing connected Nu strain. Calling it. There's assumption things can't know. That's mistake. Disney Requires Visitors Perfect TL;DR. Thank True Well. slow down, stop it. already here. Especially mutation concerns. Well, news reports vaccinated people getting it? Nearly 20 months pandemic lockdowns first began, governments across Europe beginning tighten restrictions amid latest wave new coronavirus cases, threatening gains region made pandemic.

France racing offer booster shots adults renew health passes refuse. Deaths rising Germany, 68 percent vaccination rate, worrying trend highly inoculated country. Austria nationwide lockdown since Monday, made vaccinations mandatory.

In Eastern Europe, far-right populist groups fueled vaccine skepticism, vaccination rates lower rest continent. Bulgaria, quarter population fully vaccinated, turning back shutdowns restrictive measures.

The quickly deteriorating situation Europe worrisome United States, seven-day average new cases risen 24 percent past two weeks. (The number new deaths reported United States 6 percent.) Trends new cases United States tended follow Europe weeks.  “Then stop clapping” bit strange nobody seems plan scenario. everything we’ve Delta, nobody thought new variant would emerge day, came strategy deal it? Still people going watch football Europe usual. 

All activities halted europe put hard lockdown world saved. problem they’re newly exposed may test positive immediately. One Hong Kong cases negative PCR test immediately arrival Hong Kong, tested positive two days later Like listening Baghdad Bob issuing statement US troops Baghdad. proper contact tracing compliance it’s completely possible. Maybe two weeks wouldn’t taken much longer that. Since Black Death’s main vector rat fleas, presumably whether humans died quickly secondary importance evolutionary pressure? bacteria didn’t hurt fleas… So... best guess, would transmissible Delta, also severe? Delta bad news terms severity too. world seems like one cares one foremost news source pandemic youtube, million subscribers, become increasingly vaccine seriously wonder [pandering 3:13 shows results poll made: 73% audience want vaccine mandates 86% believe lab leak theory   agree completely. Maybe wasn’t right reporter job. Agreed, that’s another point vaccine mandates higher immune response means mutations generally weaker.

Reading stuff looks like mutated unvaccinated individual aids hiv fuck yammering  ... galaxy brain good point. But... lived world took pandemics disease transmission half-seriously decades leading this. still planet hop plane fly anywhere. Anytime. token testing disease prevention measures start endpoints.  


If due new Influenza new COVID variant, eventually next decades Nature force issue us.  


Humanity must change habits become wiser, ""big one"" happen eventually. world living in... viruses, variants, masks, lockdowns, air travel restrictions, social distancing...

In 1,5 years thrown completely different world, whole new dimension society made way mainstream media mind's people... way interact ha's radically changed ... ""interesting"" time alive. It’s ready spread world, news coming thick fast probably already is. found even Hong Kong Sorry bearer terrible COVID news, [finding scarring asymptomatic too. right actually, managed get case numbers low. thinking Alpha, never really took there. South Africa high vaccination rate, 24% fully vaccinated currently stopping spreading. slowing down. guess we're thinking waves Good thing isn’t big football game Michigan Saturday point though, given Pfizer pill 89% effective, can't see Merck pill used much all. Yeah, lower IQ typically means someone easily manipulated. suspect many vaccinated entire picture. they've brainwashed think.

Regardless intelligence, healthcare denied.  virus playing us, full assault coming hahaha i’m fucking depressed :) Scott Gottlieb rescue: individual cases antivaxxers talked people leaving hospital. one case, guy died 3 days later. know severe symptoms new variant among vaccinated individuals? evidence suggest standard COVID tests error prone new variant?

Not trolling, follow news regularly way South Africa punished countries like US shittiest genome surveillance planet. Two new strains discovered South Africa likely mainly actually lookout them, better genomic surveillance US sad considering much less money US, importantly rapidly announce findings even things far ""proven"" new variant (US waaaay slow this). SA suffered travel bans like pretty much anywhere. said, still right thing do, bit unfair. Please spread misinformation. 

Omicron *might* level resistance vaccines differs variants. Even so, resistance mean vaccines ineffective. vaccines highly effective life saving. absolutely evidence vaccines ineffective Omicron, whole lot evidence are. got first vaccine state California, second shot state Oregon, booster state Oregon.

Kaiser currently trying convince get another booster Oregon (which would 4th shot).

The state California sending emails months try get get ""2nd"" shot.

I sent state California picture vaccine card though official form said could verify second shot match state records, resumed sending emails try convince get another shot.

I spent 45 minutes phone Kaiser try update Oregon medical records, vaccine update form longer exists online woman end line submitted ticket fix issue (which help update medical records). 

This mind numbingly dumb thing ever.

Apparently need get another shot California (my 4th 5th shots) another booster California (6th shot) everyone's medical records say I'm date two states can't fucking share information.  share handles please? Medically we're much stronger position, OTOH we've taken right bruising. I'm sure world population could face renewed restrictions climb hole (even quicker). ""Storm teacup""??.. finish showing vertical curves! 

Weird article.

and what's repeated pics? Fair enough. responding ""vaccine resistant polio"" comment specifically, intending imply current-gen vaccines negative public health. 

There's still difference ""more virulent"" ""vaccine evading"" though. Unvaccinated people might responsible fair share mutations, there's selective pressure (either terms virus competition within bodies - they're source mutation, terms transmission likelihood otherwise) virus specifically vaccine-evading. citizens South Africa cannot turned away country. 1,134 000 children experienced death caregivers parents result pandemic according Lancet medical journal . know ""those people"" two years ago not, new people who've never before, refusal wear masks puts others risk continues pandemic.

From perspective, seems like little downside, outside economic interests, restricting travel, versus upside preventing spread. feel like really advising things based economics, they?

What would ""scientific approach"" referring dictate time? 

If anyone could help understand taking stance, would really appreciated. Need ready treat people vaccines catching up.

Hopefully regulatory hurdles mRNA vaccines shift quickly.

Yes nothing supposed 100% nothing, that’s waited patiently vaccine came out, responsible citizens take vaccine (and boosters come out) returning normal lives.

The emergence new variants like B.1.1.5.2.9 could avoided  
if wealthy countries ensured poorer nations access Covid  
jabs, experts said.

Scientists described B.1.1.5.2.9 , detected countries including  
South Africa, “most worrying we’ve seen”, found  
contain large number mutations may make  
transmissible, may also help evade body’s immune system.

But experts Tim Bierley, pharma  
campaigner Global Justice Now, said rise variant  
“entirely avoidable” conditions emergence  
created low- middle-income countries “actively prevented”  
by UK equitable access vaccines.

“For year, South Africa, Botswana, countries  
been calling world leaders waive intellectual property  
coronavirus vaccines, tests treatments, produce  
own jabs. It’s vital measure discussed next week’s  
World Trade Organization conference. But, far, UK EU  
recklessly blocked making progress.

“If new variant starts tear world, remember 
 British government led opposition plan could  
have stopped it.”

Dr Ayoade Alakija, co-chair Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance,  
said: “I angry right now,. Even moral argument didn’t work  
for them, lost sight common morality, common  
humanity, even enlightened self-interest perspective,  
surely, surely, understood vax world  
equitably quickly possible, going see 
 variants springing don’t know whether we’re going able 
 control .”

While Botswana, one first countries B.1.1.5.2.9 detected, worked hard Covid vaccine programme, many remain unvaccinated. According WHO, 25 November, total 1,016,989 vaccine doses administered Botswana, Reuters suggesting 
 38.3% population received least one dose. South  
Africa, Reuters suggests 24.1% population two doses.

Adam Finn, professor paediatrics University Bristol 
 member Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI)  
warned approach vaccinating re-vaccinating  
increasingly low-risk people wealthy countries would “rebound rich

economic damage direct consequence.

“There isn’t need altruism – hard-nosed self interest – 
 somehow politicians continue fail grasp 
 us advising told clearly anything outside  
borders outside remit,” told Guardian.

However, Danny Altmann, professor immunology Imperial College  
London also emphasised additional complexities around B.1.1.5.2.9,  
South Africa currently excess vaccine stocks can’t use due  
to vaccine hesitancy.

Research suggested problem larger among white adults, one study August revealing half willing receive Covid jab compared 75% Black adults.

But Alakija said issues unrelated. “Had  
South Africa indeed rest Africa allowed access  
vaccines time rich countries world  
wouldn’t uncontrolled spread replication subsequent  
mutation virus,” said. Interim results Botswana's like 29% tho Petition call new variant ""Anti-vax virus"". happened everyone supposed to. :(

fuck virus thing matters vaccines work it. work it’s good, don’t could looking next pandemic might want hold thought little bit new variant. Looks like concern vaccines may help much given mutations time tell.


Best mean time reduce spread masks simplest nearly harmless way that. Yeah zero indication deaths caused Omicron. optimist wants believe less severe. optimist vacation almost two years though. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Vaccines would work fine A: people take B: virus mutate much Okay, so, government someone abide lockdowns? source Possible risk increased Sinophobic hate crimes. get wrong, fan Party avoided racial disaster imo Link please? Canada never outdoor mask rules fatr less cases places did.

Shows theater really.

Focus needs near 100 masks indoors. 4 vaccinated. promising soon jump gun cause panic. Hope gets contained get prevalent like Delta. Media aside, situations nothing alike. Mu detected months anyone paid attention it, paid attention scientists additional months named it, already clearly losing Delta* time named.

Omicron discovered Tuesday, scientists started panicking Wednesday, Thursday media figured could get lot clicks it, Friday still know almost nothing it. I’m pretty sure CDC said can’t decide get one correlates previous two vaccines had. doctor might could offer that. get skipped nu can’t think sci-fi apocalypse Greek letter omicron. Omega would worse it’s bit overdone. 

I wonder pi also get skipped? whose alphabet gets used burn one? don’t know sure yet. Grab em arm, you’re star let vaccinate vaxxed! Ugh. go....... Thanks I’ll reading urged countries repeat mistake failing act quickly.

A convoluted way phrase ""He urged countries act quickly"" name transformer, transformer planet killer. Let us hope correlation lol. Damn. really looking forward hearing people attempt pronounce Xi. WTF downvoted, next Greek letter mu. Although see side, point (yet) enough data say whether need close borders, take drastic measures. Right now, seems variant several mutations; know transmissible, evade immunity, lead worse outcomes etc. changing, might know next couple days.

If closed borders country every time new variant comes up, would international travel (for example, /r/covid posts right now, variant also Israel Belgium; close borders too?). really hope know that? got moderna booster couple days ago expected side effects different previous two shots. wrong. Full body shivering later night, followed fever, headache, muscle aches, joint pain next day. I'm pretty much recovered today, got much stronger response wondered they'd accidentally given full dose again. true except however chance airports allow anyone enter/leave country anyway regardless citizenship. Pretty sure happened Australia early covid. reason use twitter. Absolutely, careful now, variant turns concerning, travel reopen.   change physics virus, susceptible UV light, humidity, etc. Joe Rogan calling Australia police state? Apparently skipped ahead Omicron avoid Abbott Costello situation connection China's government.  Britain *didn't* shut flights India right away. negotiating trade deal them, government decided delay travel ban long possible. Next greek letters are: pi, rho, sigma, tau, upsilon, phi, chi, psi, omega Aww shit go again. win Plague Inc. let people catch disease get symptoms it’s late stop spread activate deadly symptoms Well, pandemics end like that. virus wants survive, dead host typically prevents spreading. milder forms infectious typical evolution. 100 tomorrow  Omicron, coming soon theatre near you.

*I'll baaAAAck...* Check furry's thread. SA low rate COVID variants general (including present spike) means new variant necessarily competing delta all, potentially filling void delta would filled country delta actively spreading. data needed see virus spreads delta already actively spreading, vaccination rates higher. 

Let's collectively log leave things people activity collecting analysing data. Maybe come back couple days understood. remember going bed one night thinking probably already state (Oregon) waking news confirmed case next morning. 

This variant could there’s many breakthrough cases. could help fast track end pandemic.

Rip unvaccinated world, make small dent vaccinated first world become endemic non-scary way.

Better prolonged suffering we're enduring now. Probably friend happy French approach making stuff make point. mostly young people getting might suggest vaccines effective (assuming older people much likely vaxxed).  stress o. Damn. Thank info... hopefully supply issues ease soon there. Wish could send ones idiot antivax people refusing. Thanks link mRNA really big thing going us right now. allow us successfully adapt might faster pace past.  stable virus doesn’t mutate, allows us even semblance vaccine. HIV mutates fast we’ve vaccine decades research. 

The part problem relatively low mutation rate widespread is, still lot mutations even though x low multiplying charts.  Could be, people around don’t travel much. currently nearly 45% vaccination rate! Go us!  sure I'd read mutations spike protein new variant. little concern building..    hardly delta outcompete, lowest incidence since beginning pandemic hell connected Mexico Canada? Travel bands absolutely work. tired this. Oh nothing work. Might well throw hands anything. partially case counts low begin with? looking SA's numbers, roughly 250 cases/day new variant hit.

When Delta hit, still 1000 cases/day.

So new variant could become dominant strain much easily, since fewer Delta infections anyways feel man, virtual hug normal new South African variant, I’m starting wonder pandemic ever over. 

I’m assuming new variant already USA it’s matter time next surge. mean home best medical research institutions world? Britain? Bad news, may beginning first wave. new variant turns something, think would actually give up. completely strength deal shit.  This. Instead grasping straws, chucking vaccines antivaxxers wouldn’t take going “boosters everyone…I guess,” use extra stock, getting vaccines lower income countries getting many people worldwide shots possible. That’s way we’ll prevent variants emerging. Twitter quote reference regarding delta saying cell immunity would hold up, does. Similarly, boosters aren’t needed 6 months later measure effectiveness hospitalization/death working designed. Seems you’re cherry picking comments attempt discredit nothing said particularly damning. Trumps going say one could get done would lot urgency Delta booster trial production turn third shot OG vaccine works pretty damn well Delta though. Aka needed. Middle East airport security sucks. Dubai, torn apart luggage couldn’t answer question directly. I’m Deaf able communicate writing sign language. !remindme 10 days Smallpox started reappearing, thinking measles others.


And smallpox eradication Easy. heard compared moon landing terms effort money give rest, said vaccine delta 6 months ago.  means one definitive vaccine, like hepatitis smallpox. 

Every year new vaccine made common cold virus exactly mutates quite fast. difference Covid influenza understand influenza it’s around long time able predict fairly high degree accuracy variants dominant year produce corresponding vaccine. That’s theres yearly vaccine drive it.

The difference influenza, potential spread quickly, isn’t close lethal damaging covid, nobody cares much.

Give years covid probably similar boat. Yearly (or biannually) vaccine drives less presence headspace us all, point whole world either vaccinated multiple strands exposed multiple strands, diminishes impact newer strands notch Turns real life one airlines would lose money. can’t that. got news you. Covid never gonna over. It’s stay.

So hope you’re ok never eating restaurant decades. seeing friends person. Isn’t delta described initially tho? mostly agree, however deaths likely massively undercounted due poor testing rates. real death toll probably several times higher reported.

Source: political issue vs legal point start treating like flu hospitalization mortality rates match flue ones. Nurses, doctors, lab personel quitting droves, can't really let go yet. heard second   even listening? Even ban international travel virus still spread possible eliminate every single form travel world. look China effective international travel restrictions are. They're getting outbreaks frequently despite heavy travel restrictions. comment shows great deal ignorance virus actually works, coupled great deal xenophobia.  thing checked vaccine card. confirm birthdate booster receiving. Everyone else elderly. felt strange young one there. understand though anyone 18 go pharmacy receive booster vaccine card.

I figure ever yell truthfully say job requires work elderly veterans often weak health disabilities/injuries college students typically work high traffic fast food supermarket areas worry affecting vulnerable populations. feel that, got booster last week feel like moron. long lockdown need next year new variant? We've three- four-monthers Melbourne, I'm thinking require more. literally says variant evades previous vaccinations immunity won’t enough time transmissible say is. want sign clinical trials new experimental virus? Nah, it’ll like “get $1.00, pay shipping handling… $499.” coworker accidently no-fly list due similar name someone else able get taken care years back. show proof identity like ignored him. bubonic plague lasted roughly 200 years. Same, US Novavax trial. got two Moderna shots August due antibodies dropping. planning 5th dose soon. 

Bold statements cause lot issues official backtracks. There's already much hesitancy around vaccines. Yep. I’m 3x vaccinated. I’ll continue go concerts, bars, travel.

If get covid it. Willing take risk. think vaccines keep seriously ill. definitely problem accurate reporting. Africa low testing rate, deaths likely several times higher reported. estimated real africa death toll 870k 2.6 m. 

Source: already much immunity globally (much confirmed) anything comes along transmissible deadly last kills host fast maintain spread like Delta first place. fitness advantage result. Delta good gets regards spread far. Could something emerge transmissible? Yes. deadly? No. something comes along deadly pathogenic, would burn much faster. Especially contagious. reading one like there. bunch new, significant changes make possible current vaccines less/not effective. mention communicative deadly. I'm virologist though. [South Africa much supply according demand local logistics problem there.

I dunno rest Africa though. Sky news UK reporting three cases Botswana, 53 South Africa one Hong Kong. Yet clear numbers invalid UK added 6 African countries red list, flights temporarily banned. People need stop choosing lowest cost carriers long keep squeezing costs hiding fees Reminder get boosters!!  Dad?  Happy Thanksgiving! Time worst variant yet, Oh wait mutates airborne waterborne variant. Good times ahead. Exactly. I’m go back lockdown new wave that’s rise roommates plans so… they’ll probably continue going bars bring back house… looks bad almost apocalyptic reading. might enough change spike protein call SARS-COV-3 saw *Shrugs* get another booster. hard sit, quiet, fly, leave?  would tend think Covid mutations made much transmissible would probably decrease mortality. exactly case Delta, knows

Is really case? mean, sure, two evolutionary pressures exist, necessarily relationship. People die carry virus longer, sure, reason work way round.  would say outcompeting less deadly would good thing, half people end ICU delta twice virulent (leading way quicker exponential growth) still ending people ICU one time. end though everyone less people ill dead (if died widespread code black situations). Can’t African countries dismal vaccination rate. It’s problem entire world entire world needs get act together try get everyone vaccinated going keep happening.  reading articles variant, think mortality rate around 3%…… Per dose… need 10 doses full effect Seems Cochise role play apocalypse non-fiction fiction. Oh ok problem vaccinating whole world... Also smallpox started reappearing recently due anti vaxxers so...  housemates. obvious focus stop countries restricting flights giving SA negative press.

114 deaths number infections low seem like ""only mild cases"". Honestly, no. fully vaccinated potent protection. wanna extra safe wear mask whenever crowded area. 

Have nice trip mean they’re going walk chew gum 3 once. (and we) would best shape booster normal one works able fly FDA approvals. Second best would something they’re testing anyway works. Worst case, put specific booster through. I'm kind confused this. find anything NU variant page also assumed would called NU. NU already announced? also new? happened? really. data support going dangerous?  boosters wealthy nations, even delays rest world, could possibly go wrong! vaccines prevent infection won’t vaccines act like antibiotics don’t finish way?? Allowing even facilitating mutation avoid vaccine measures?  Back COVID starting become thing, remember concern Country banned travelers Country B, people Country B would first travel Country C, didn’t travel restrictions, going Country anyways, could complicate contact tracing. won’t comment whether good line thought, one argument made travel bans. People think government planning control. read initial reports say one 500% infectious  Lol imagine awfully clever yourself. thing on?   sounds like Dragon Quest final boss. well comparatively high HIV positive population. virus look worse comparatively. FWIW, [there appear virologists think booster (or natural immunity plus vaccination) best way protected Deal fourth shot issue get there, know literally couldn’t protected atm. great. thought booster end... POTENTIALLY 75%. god fucking sakes. company really money. smh mean human lives real world promise. job much consumed disease, literally cannot escape it. they're losing jobs, they're throwing away. reccomend ask doctor pharmacist question news conference happened hours ago. copied quotes twitter watching. quick reaction UK government (who acting exact opposite pandemic) good sign. 

Don’t surprised get repeat March 2020 comment sad cause honestly point people would Olympic level mental gymnastics convince hoax even evidence contrary smack dab middle face! oooh makes 5/8 conspiracy bingo, current conspiracy theorists lead whats actually happening. finish 1 row need ""new variant across europe may cancel christmas"" However, *for vaccinated people*, serious threat. 

I live New York [our local data shows rates hospitalizations death vaccinated individuals 88.9% 82.9% lower unvaccinated individuals, *In total*, 401 vaccinated people city 8.8 million individuals died COVID-19. extraordinarily successful. already Israel Belgium, already US. Hope soon mask mandate embraced worldwide. R0 numbers Delta variable? Sometimes hear 8, sometimes hear 0.8-1 (Public Health Ontario, Canada)
Is credible source shows actual R0 number ? dare speak logic facts!  Skynet activated absolutely works way nurses. bigger shortage. staffing.  guess could get technical say satisfy CDC definition, definition includes ""non-standardized"" component (expectation). Let put like instead: countless large waves across entire world decades come. like flu. Whether it'll worse better depends primarily vaccines.  question might better posed thousands people ICUs dying vaccinated. ones dead yet course. Considering vaccinated people are, know.. hospital, alive well, spreading disease. Even better then. Half million die someone little freedom brag around. American thing, outside world wouldn’t understand. really hope for. strain takes delta, making people less sick, it’s extremely positive development.  surprised. Yet slower rise I, even Britain's scientific experts expected. managed without restrictions since 19th July.  Supply issues sadly. people hesitant even forced take available. However notice vaccinations ramped since august , thats started get supply locally manufactured vaccines started pouring supply Best luck you! actually happened yesterday, turns 6 alarm fire oil factory like 5 min here.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* People give shit anymore. Government care either.   Soooo symptoms bad? Possibly? Nice time two weeks ago friends Paris got tested running fever (had flu), got tested problem. might area…Seems counter productive point testing. Literally that's definition outcompeting delta. Seeing lots statements countries like US banning travel *from* South Africa countries… travel *to*? one way ticket South Africa 3+ month stay… get quote from? infections less severe good development, true.  Awful run sentence Amen. Freedom die freedom suppose really vulnerable people can't vaccinated. vaccine safe immuno-compromised people, rich world 3 doses might need 4th achieve good protection, absolutely vaccinated. vulnerable people qualify vaccines children 5 serious medical conditions, even less risk Covid healthy elderly people are. earth cleaned...  Heck people think ""stomach flu"" caused influenza Norovirus Rotavirus. could even Staph enterotoxin lumped generic category Stomach flu bu way flu GI pathogen humans. Probably Nu Variant sounds like title Limp Bizkit album. new variant bad say wouldn’t surprised see lockdown. Especially it’s killing people waves Beta. hope not. I’m tired this. got booster literally 10 minutes ago. read comment head Russian accent, pleased see user name. Horoshow! Well wrote yes individual scale less lethal (on average) flu due vaccination rates many countries.

Read wrote again. US country world, ok? problem Us South Africa Europe, point clear plan unvaccinated people travel.

Because home breeding new variants. don’t care conspiracy people position vaccines, people’s freedom hurt WHOLE world punished. Shhh buying dip hard :). mask friend! Lol that's article 7 says Novavax like parent promises big things never shows up… Shut lmao. cant believe amount conspiracies going around here. got wind potential covid 3.0 saw market pushing ATH. want assess risk sold positions. fucking complicated.   entirely new variant heavily, heavily mutated, preliminary reports suggest much transmissible Delta. Wearing mask crowded outdoor spaces seems like one least onerous precautions person take.   link could go to? sorta bought bunch PFE shares beginning year. portfolio looking pretty good right now... Delta hit April Northern hemisphere approaching summer (low transmission conditions). hitting north hitting winter (high transmission conditions). Tell it. Idk work another surge. Hospital staff thin burnt already. Sigh….. damn dont gotta rude it, asking question curious daily discussion thread, dont really see bad... would also selection pressure favors deadlier mutants, would genetic drift mean still defeated AIDS virus developed therapeutics make normal life somewhat possible. imagine airborn AIDS caused paradoxical hyper-active immune responses. we'd shits creek. 
Market gonna rebound quick investigate boost needed even applying it? Well, least best.   Well draw get new vaccines variant. say mRNA vaccines easy adapt new variants, probably approved much faster. yeah basically shit starts happen again. get MMO vaccine? need stop playing Airlines privately owned, public infrastructure. 1. No, none ever found. [initial cumulative incidence curves appear change week vaccine dose.

2. gonna ask doctor professional medical site one. say vaccination severely dehydrate you, problem people airplane travel already. make sure get plenty water electrolytes.

Delaying second shot give significantly better results, also possibility cause harm.   Also people Hong Kong got 2x Pfizer 6 months ago asymptomatic. Sounds like vaccine working Yes people supposed listen leaders, expected understand lied to?

For example, austrian head state entire lineup ruling party ministers repeated, ad nauseam every opportunity, vaccinated people pandemic over, solution, like used be. didnt buy generally dont believe them, also means dont believe measures plans manage this. 

I think unrealistic expect people believe leaders, still say. know right. 
I mean options taking every precaution possibly wearing mask potentially getting covid dying surviving getting body permanently wrecked it, choose masking hands down. 

Literally wearing mask hurting anyone, get animosity towards wearing one. We've seen steady decline vaccine efficacy spike mutates efficient humans. individual mutation takes one antibody previously worked, makes useless - antibodies continue work, cell machinery (that takes months body develop) make new antibodies still recognizes fights virus. 

As time gone mutations shown greater number, increasing decline. Counting number mutations Nu leads scientists worried could evasive Delta (which already 2.5x breakthrough rate wildtype). mean, would stop halted travel complexly, indefinitely, would shut country economy.   Getting worse worse vaccine mutations work. virus looking creative ways kill that's evolutionary advantage virus. look ways either spread quickly evade existing immunity, both. Oftentimes, especially something mutated this, one two things happen: either virus volatile unstable die (see: Lambda), mutate less dangerous form (see: Spanish flu.)

People saying massive disaster completely base. chance *could* outcompete Delta, yes, way face modifying vaccines combat it. mutations occurred untreated AIDS patient, it’s likely vaccines would effect whatsoever. two Hong Kong double vaxxed. They’ve also destroy tens thousands doses vaccine hesitancy parliament taking time approving training workers task. It’s never simple ‘donate vaccines’. mutation could easily come infected animal pool. Why? Israel proved original booster needed delta making feel little better I’ve seen Twitter, don’t know data providing reliable not. Finally, someone reason. soon title words ""new variant"" ""mutant"" shows up, everyone thinks apocalypse going come. know early i'm desperate optimism.

are chances new variant much less dangerous (causing less severe symptoms) compared already known variants? New variant, yada yada yada. high-school human biology knowledge, Pfizer anti-viral drug works inhibiting enzymes allow virus replicate, entirely different mechanism spike based vaccinations Moderna Pfizer's vaccines. mean theory variants we're seeing? imagine mutations spike protein probably matter much protease inhibitor? much would virus mutate make protease inhibitor worthless? know HIV anti-retrovirals constantly race stay ahead drug resistance, coronavirus?  here. husband never stopped masking public. two small kids can't vaccinated yet. Yeah, used directed. directed used daily prevent covid.  proof wasn’t  Man, oh man... ever stop simply get worse worse variants us? someone shave often should, lives colder part world. bad hah. No…..it wasn’t dominant variant…. moment, random even near random sampling South African viral genomes.

There Covid cluster among students one universities Tshwane, part case tracing South Africa concentrated sequencing November cluster.

There's circumstantial evidence ordinary PCR diagnostic testing B.1.1.529 may widespread throughout South Africa. today's South African Dept Health briefing, [this part presentation. Like Alpha variant, B.1.1.529 causes dropout amplified sequence protein, growth tracked without full genome sequencing (small good news). sampling near random, dropouts mostly accounted B.1.1.529, prevalence jumped \~0% \~50% month.

That's still concerning (brown pants time, really), data really want see whether South Africa commensurate jump hospitalizations critical cases. found data Dept. Heath website. See post Boooo! Holy fuck.

I never thought looked up. Median age US 38, Brazil 33.5, Japan 48, Mali 16. Vaccinated people still get covid transmit tho lot gate agents flight attendants shitty attitudes everyone knows it. 

This issue article really issue people power know dynamic haha. 

When bunch Karens getting power trips small, crowded tubes, you’re going issues. real assholes violent whatever naturally arrested passengers even turn them. know right, else could possibly skills pick fruit backpacking tourists? works well flu.    Thanks information. hope right I’m overly cautious. even matter hoarding. Africa infrastructure, education, etc even hope get significant vaccination effort going short time frame. Even best case scenario would still seeing low vaccination rates there. Deaths lag cases. would start assuming fatality rates unchanged proven otherwise.  vocs mutations change antigen invariably reduce vaccine efficacy. That's saw 95% 2-dose mrna efficacy wildtype, 90% alpha, 88% delta - back 96% 3-dose efficacy delta.

The question vaccines ""still work"" - know immune system works. Nu immune escape compared wildtype - know does. 

The question breakthroughs reinfections contagious enough young people, deadly enough old people, cause problem. question whether yet profitable upgrade vaccines multivalent continue protect widening range antigens.

5% South Africa tested positive 28% first dose. Higher immune escape unlikely explain Nu's possibly outcompeting Delta. absolutely something need verify ASAP. don’t think we’d seeing sudden international response one going hospital variant. say ban air travel airlines T.S.A job make sure don’t get inside. Keep sympathy got healthcare workers. said ""couldn't reproduce""... could still reproduce even population 100% vaccinated virus freak nature, yeah. Extremely, extremely rare something like would develop, let alone market Wuhan (if believe theory.)  Dude stop it’s sad. Something I’ve learned past year “top virologists” nothing sort, doctors, people peripheries others thriving bad news notoriety brought them. Chise posts logic facts without alarm emojis dramatics, refreshing.  long. lot infrastructure there. tweaking/testing vaccine probably much faster now. 

But would wait done yes. sure long. Yes part USA commonwealth. Don’t care life back normal isn’t gonna change. old can’t get vaccine social distance everyone else whatever  hope worst, drops efficacy little bit. 

In reality, worst case grim. would people do?

Clearly people cannot convinced fucking thing. would people half way decent human beings year fucking half ago actually fucking work killing virus. Failing though, I'd like stop blaming anything failure handle covid. virus ""setting schedules"" ""making choices us"". done ourselves, I'm fucking sick tired cop outs. Humanity simply cannot make good choices totality... period. make people entering? citizen isn’t vaxxed leaves, can’t keep out? suck racing games too. mean anything. 

A lot unvaccinated people asymptomatic. Nah, gotta bring *correct* religion you. missionary trying bring wrong one, that's all... 😅

Edit: formatting. kind tonal whiplash makes anxiety spiral. one hand see apocalyptic predictions grave concern top virologist see takes like this.

I get know yet, goddamn, man, responses enough drive me, I'm sure countless others, deep waves depression anxiety. delta variant already spreading around India vaccines out. last two years shower travel bans work? actually nice. knee jerk response carefully toned originally wanted say. 

Good luck winning arguments calling people terrorists whatever pit bull analogy trying be. True, SA super low vaxxed. Terrible. horrible environment make conclusions of. 

It's likely already spread countries... we'll finding soon enough variant about. 

Let get highly ""immune"" population see happens. starts taking high numbers cases/deaths even among vaxxed we're serious serious trouble. you’re less likely contract less likely transmit it. It’s difficult concept. insurance charges smokers extra $750/yr. I’d ok non vax surcharge I'm sorry loss. :( Anyone rich enough view $10,000 acceptable fine flying private. deter assholes.

We're still taxing rich; incomes, wealth. piddling 3%, either. last sentence key. think scientific progress going stop now?

Look much got done first year pandemic. people brought us vaccines antiviral drugs aren’t going call job stop working new ideas now.

We may manage living virus years, strike balance keep getting hand bad times year still keeping life economy normal possible.

But decade still dealing winter case surges, point found way beat thing. kill mutates tries again. consider virus freak nature then? happen often..... 


Not mention spike protein mutation, gonna need new vaccine soon. original Wuhan strain pre-vaccine R-value 5-6, IIRC.

Vaccines, distancing, restrictions made big difference getting number down. flu vaccine took? ;) Based competency FDA CDC, Americans would still fucked. Boosters, approved 18+, still recommended 50+ according morons, remember.  need find way get vaccines developing countries. really....

Many UNVACCINATED people asymptomatic catch covid. 

That small sample size (couple people hong kong) make conclusions of. Sounds like hostile work environment. reading Masque Red Death again? take possibly vaccine resistant strain seriously, saying here? way spread outside South Africa, I've seen episode before. I'm waiting hear virus mutated become transmissable internet. *golf clap tropic thunder reference* do, cold virus influenza flu. That’s don’t vaccines them. Well gonna die anyway. still behind somehow two years later. inevitable. others saying: Anyone tests positive Hong Kong hospitalised minimum 10 days, regardless symptoms. Even asymptomatic cases treated way. FedEx employee, tourist, brought delta variant Australia. modern society cannot function without level international travel. ""novel"" virus + certainty? Pandemics definitely inconvenient. updated vaccine Delta would worse variant it’s lineage Delta. immunocompromised kids babies 5. .... scientists bro. That's at. Collecting data taking precautions. far, looks real bad.  It’s new variant new strain. Donald Trump didn’t like way looked mask snowballed form possible new variant less deadly. change mind. Surgical/N95 masks always beneficial public short supply far important medical personnel caregivers/patients them. Instead, people stay away other.

Availability masks, homemade import masks changed. Also, people follow instructions stay away other, get vaccinated, etc.  knew virus later rather following general public health procedures, anyway, changing minds would perfectly valid.

There nonsense masks offering one way protection; traditionally used medicine certified. help protect patient one medical person adequate protect medical person 50 infected patients. incorrectly thought provide protection wearer. medical personnel wearing protection well protection others.

There nonsense masks reducing airborne particles, vs droplets, rated 0.3 microns virus smaller. masks rated 0.3 microns hardest size block. Small particles move straight lines, zig zag become caught meshes/fabrics. block 0.3microns block particles (but gas molecules) smaller larger least well.

There nonsense among public, especially anti-maskers, masks either providing protection (100% protection (0%), could in-between Haha lol I'm ""tech bro"" well luxury work home. mean can't see importance international travel. That's generally trajectory wish knew biology viruses. illnesses constantly mutate like this? that's classist bs, poor people likely obnoxious/unruly. experience admittedy anecdotal i've encountered plenty wealthy people behave like absolute children pettiest reasons. phenomenon based income hear amish MMO vaccines Lol think Israel made right call temporarily ban flights countries US same. variant turns less pathogenic minor inconvenience travelers. consequences highly vaccine resistant variant transmitted US around holidays would horrific. Reason still work. like iOS update. need one unless need one theory mrna vaccines changed new mutation within 6 weeks. production, distribution, administration takes time. Travel restrictions would pointless counterproductive juncture. variant already majority cases one country it’s already spreading elsewhere. focus efforts toward developing updated vaccine. patent idea, could potentially make billions. cares think? vaccinate 85 90 percent population come conclusion?  Tbats exactly reason. cant remember comedian heard talking said 3 sets shows different cities, private flights shave like 6 hours time airports whole trip.  good news scientists told Mail unprecedented number mutations might make “unstable,” prevent becoming add there’s need “overly concerned” signs yet spreading rapidly keeping eye it.

This good example unnecessary media fear mongering, sure get clicks topic discussion around Thanksgiving dinner table. reported major news outlets. big thing  Moderna dose younger kids much lower adults (not sure compares Pfizer age bracket). Anecdotally, son part trials, I've told seeing many side effects low dose. concerns you, I'm hoping second dose goes okay (it could placebo also).  see. difference compared measles good vaccine it, even contracting disease gives long-term immunity upon recovery. Clearly case virus, looks unlikely ever case  even extreme measures like Wuhan lockdown won’t help something infectious, else could possibly done? definitely hope pray less lethal hospital workers much lockdown-resistant vaccine-resistant strain would break camel’s back.  Africa massive. South-Africa lot troubles covid previous year too. MArokko. 
Covid also kills lot old people people wealth diseases. 


If look age pyramid see massive amount young people, little old people.  
Covid also spreads easier cold, inside,... Africa lot places covid spread less. 


Last all, many cases go undetected. Enjoy, contention outdated beliefs akin internet public service. “You’re right, it’s not, be.”  flying civil liberty? would purpose replacing Fauci? saying? Delta variant, bunch more. even new one today. tracking them. Nobody says ""mutates fast delta delta one now""  cant anymore. thing never fucking end keep getting worse worse variants. one right fly. End times shit pov. fucking insane still trying compare flu. Anyone says shit like forced work line cook fully masked 40 hours Yeah, got bunch N95s go somewhere stupid like movie theater. Black mirror shit. Therye putting measures July stopped delta tracks. untrue. moderna testing vaccines 3 variants concern year. however regular vaccine highly effective there’s little reason “warp speed” group causing problems anything white republicans, we'd already calling terrorism &amp; shipping people gitmo  fly anywhere, drive, bus, train, boat. back affordability chartering, that's cost asshats absolutely banned 5 years.  anymore, ever did. serious symptoms, otherwise would've remained quarantine

Not necessarily case, think. likely hospitalize everyone tests positive Covid, regardless symptoms, like mainland China.

Here's video guy tested positive quarantining Hong Kong, sent hospital receive treatment symptoms small:  Encode delayed self destruct directive counter virus giving blue ears infect everyone world it.  mind much stupid people self-destructive.  keep things take sensible people though. Depends mutations contains, sequencing technology become fast cheap much lag sequencing sampling positives. I’ve always wondered families see get wiped mutations particularly virulent. surprising number general public also believe earth flat. So, I’m going choose listen doctors nurses one meantime. Finished flying. Traffic airport AMAZING - leaving Atlanta incredible. . Domestic looked quiet alas every international flyer idea me. Seemed normal busy. Plexiglass supposed stop spittle, back thought corona couldn’t float air.  agree. better safe sorry. Hopefully they've learned lesson Delta.     think finding variant? infected humans.    Yes, that’s *literally* laws mandates work — follow pay consequences. complete extinction species virus incredibly rare nature... would unlucky.   century pandemic needed change usual way business, rather break bend. US France, rigid system runs entire world Mistake #1 trusting anything coming someone working government. They're either lying teeth grossly incompetent talk anything. Yeah argue England ( also Israel ) careful. suspect others soon. still constitute hard evidence defeat current immunity vaccines - risk open question reasons:

-	this engineered virus undoubtedly mutate something able control.
-	mRNA vaccines safer containing inactivated virus
-	no way exclude vaccine safe, children 5, whose clinical trials finalized
-	dosage uniform, can't study efficacy side effects
-	dosage may enough provide immunization.
-	consent essential modern medicine precisely address unethical studies past, cause mistrust vaccine hesitancy.
-	vaccine contents degrade moment released time absorbed population.  read another site 60 cases variant positively identified. know get real data low number. Care clarify? I'm reading article. Provide source maybe. point due sheer transmissibility, number people getting infected short time might still overflow ICUs even if, average, severity lower. always vulnerable people. Oh really? I'm sorry read article. provide source this? Either way twice many mutations say true.  fucked here!  bet we'll find vaccines still work well variant potentially less pathogenic Delta. again, stuff paper/modeled, pseudo - typed. thought Beta gonna awful nothing burger. know people confirmed variant faired? Outcomes? Delta already contagious believe statistically people likely breakthrough infection eventually, might notice vaccinated (no symptoms).  remember couple weeks back? good timing goal experience stay bed getting vaccination already sick. kill 2 birds one stone, not? get better get booster get sick again. time this.  virus lot faster smarter us. don’t think stand good chance shirt fronting without protection, fighting without armour. would pretty bold use fake card federal jurisdiction. might likely get caught, still do. England, country gone back normal, pre-covid times, already banned flights Africa. prelim theories vaccines least 40% less effective variant. Ugh.  evolutionary arms race exhausting Delta seem remember 'under investigation' long time, along many variants, governments take seriously soon enough time branded 'variant concern' already late.

By ""under investigation"" meant wasting time. variants taken concering proven otherwise. ""variant concern/variant interest/variant investigation"" labeling system bureaucratic nonsense cumbersome slow. working OG covid soon sequences published, I'm sure teams weekend. approval, discussion around ""same thing, tweaked payload: that's like annual flu shots,"" whole rigmarole probably needed. uh oh test see effect production spike protein within bodies might have? Considering quite significant mutation.  arguing someone agrees then. wear mask. getting booster tomorrow. go out. fun. Yes, that's right. hardest infect. remember plague inc correctly best bet Greenland.  close sea ports wow quickly Real zombies nearly bad people think. Almost zombie fiction effectively gives zombies superpowers let ignore physics biology dead week dehydration, exposure, long list ailments. Plus absurdly fast spread something usually requires direct fluid transmission.

Real viruses scarier zombies, far less dramatic. still tested? We're making body produce spike proteins en mass right? spike protein considerably different, testing see effect might people? I'm layman. South Africans don’t want get vaccinated. Plenty opportunities get vaccinated pep[;e aren’t. understand spokespeople keep using many redundant clumsy words instead words describe situation. Like:

""important knee-jeek reaction."" --- ""don't panic""

""this magical bag tricks"" --- ""it's unpredictable""

""the herd immunity number become mythical"" --- ""we need vaccinate people""

They partially responsible people take seriously. I've seen one study saying plenty others saying opposite. Felony 100% assets fine jail time. point can’t donate dumbasses vote. 

Remove people decision making others.  idea viable would flight disrupted unruly passenger plane on, know would much happier ground soon possible passenger removed immediately. Yes might disrupt travel plans want kicking 30000ft aluminium tube thousands moving parts. Aside criminal aspect surely airlines could make condition carriage someone's actions result extra cost liable cost. qualified know cost flight divert I'd imagine insignificant sum. Landing fees, knock delays meaning missed slots poteno ending late end day meaning airport stay open (and staffed), complying rest restrictions air crew fuel additional landing take off. Agree, people fuck around planes. youre plane, gotta civilized. applying restrictions unvaxxed totally for! don’t think really disagree! guess originally thought suggesting vaccine wasn’t working :) greedy corporations Messiah complex nations can't allow that.

Better keep patent, limit supply, keep price up, throw millions vaccines poor nations hit front page it.

USA saved Nigeria France vaccinated millions Mali ever places send charity vaccines.  Drug companies, national health systems, researches, doctors: \*fighting pandemic nonstop\*, \*developing treatments vaccines record time\*, \*giving vaccines children\*, \*planning strategies minimize damages\*

The WHO: \*giving variants greek letter names\*

Fuck world. make money? 9-10 estimates R0 'cos looks like could outspread Delta, makes potentially big deal. ""red list"" still (just countries it) allow snappy response without drag politicians again.

TBH level timely competence surprise gov, mostly waited two weeks late acting. horse deowomer. also kitten dewormer fish dewormer human dewormer. used people time, ivermectin horses different administered people flavoring.

Incredibly, even spokesman Pfizer came ""horse medicine"" line.

Aspirin used horses too. suppose we'd better stop taking it, we'll turn horses ourselves! well... damn. Man government officials saying gonna Easter, one competent enough get rid cough  ""Herd immunity"" way exact thing vaccines, deaths along way.

You get better immunity infected. get sicker. Vaccines better catching covid.

I understand frustrating. problem government society. problem virus. virus listen, matter fed are. We're shit situation easy way out. can't say ""Well, I've enough! Shoo now, Mr. Virus! "" 

If really want ""live it"" measures, screeching fucking roof tops get doctors nurses hired fucking need it. suppose anything possible stage really think bad. previous protection miles better protection all. update vaccines needed again, perhaps next year covid pills released worry getting sick either. would current vaccines effective it? much virus overwhelms immune system. least early response.

since already infected people SA - id imagine nullifies argument 'harder infect cells'. no?  question possible immune escape new variant:

from know far, vaccines still quite successful variant, even evasive Beta: would different one? anyone really expect vaccines massively lose efficacy, since case variant far? Bingo dismissive - bit cautious. Yes, many. I'm play strawman bullshit.   fuck kind insane biowarfare shit whargarbaling about? isn't, least yet. based extremely sketchy data, found variant even existed last week. Anything said variant speculation best, conjecture worst. think Covid already sweet spot transmissibility mortality. High viral load carried high respiratory tract, still affecting lungs enough serious many people. 

SARS carried much lower respiratory tract much serious, harder transmit air. 

You would tend think Covid mutations made much transmissible would probably decrease mortality. exactly case Delta, knows.  never end, accepted months ago. ive reading last days yes. something Sensationialized. could possibly real deal like Delta. 3am east, 12am west. flights moment. Give minute.  Stay strong. [I actually found answer another post, apparently person tweet belongs worked Moderna vaccine, think they're trustworthy enough. 

Apparently guy Hong Kong got detected testing positive quarantine, tested positive protocol hospitalize him. *is* apparently asymptomatic, suggests vaccines might working degree. im tired. oh super cautious 

* wear kn-95 masks buying [lloyds go shops food unless emergency like need tools lockout something  honestly could disaster march 2020 That's question too. seems point could severe could less severe. interested information driving lean severe side. Thanks link, already bit skeptical huge spike. sheer number mutations new variant concerning, patient couple days see consensus ends being. course, nuance get clicks.  Moderna announced year ago enforcing COVID vaccine patents pandemic. 

It really comes supply chains, cold chains, technical knowledge transfer. Italy barred flight SA Ah shit, go again. I'm UK, one highest death rates Europe hard classify good. Terrible initial response, pulled back good vaccine roll sleep walking collapse NHS. I'm looking forward winter even new variant turns nothing.

BBC News - NHS struggling like never Testing much prominent yeah probably every continent already BOJO anyone competing him, I'm surprised even cares. Good idea. U.S. well. Social distancing stop six feet. Beta Delta, yeah. aren’t planning releasing public though, saying now. Pfizer also said goal would variant specific vaccine new variants within 100 days. I'm denying that. buy 'Africa mutation ground' much. Cases Europe literally exploding, might well happened here. It’s two years staying isolated. People it. getting reclassified something else. wait see happens. time EU finally decided something, it'll already late second case also received second dose Pfizer June, although know exact date. Without knowledge deadly is, can't know. Could inadvertantly good follows trend less deadly, transmissible variants. They're gonna throw little ice profit boners though. get filthy rich point. what's right. EU recommendation country decide themselves.

Austria already decided go 9 months. France aggressive impose 7 month validity second shot covid pass.  think key slow buy time.   Amish actually high Covid death rate - don’t get vaccinated. Righhht ughh! Europe month, guess. That's cases started rising. point I’m going suggest worrying overreach, add Delta Plus Gamma supposed get us well ended relative nothings. Worth keeping mind. they're calling it? Nu? long covidiots start protesting restrictions measures prevent spread new variant ?! 

I wish symptoms much scarier: new variant cause extreme bleeding, people would run get mask, stay indoors. instead, they're passing germs, travelling, shit! even use free disinfectants public place. free dammit !! use 

I'm tired shit... never gonna end lot people take thing seriously     shocking price really. cutting edge drug released light speed saves life worth average android phone inadequate storage space IMO :D Delta 3 major mutations spike protein.

Nu 23. 

It's pretty likely antibody evasion.  sorry loss. Don’t worry. shall pass. Take care hygiene precautions, mask up. Think positive: adapt. 
And fine. Hey man, sometimes good step back news start feeling like that. 

I mean, variant South Africa really sphere control anyway, forget go fish workout meet friends whatever. Take easy bro.  growth slow isn't.

My new favorite math quote. untrue. 

The spring variant 1918 flu kill great deal cases. mutated summer winter deaths started happening.  yeah, six weeks earlier american thanksgiving, that’s irreverent immunocompromised?   days, air travel though, planes could traverse oceans, long range travel happened though trains ships pretty expansive reletively spoken compared todays possibilities average Joe; slowing everything enabling quarantine meaasures far effective.

If spanish flu would todays travel possibilities (and sheer incompetence stop pandemic) would decades long run. We’re Black Friday sales ( it’s whole week ) trust shits already spreading like wildfire mention December holidays coming , mid dec reckon spread variant here. take route might one make it. Life sometimes convenient get choose.  Likewise! one close anything US.

For me, feels crushing right now.  family stayed home.  responsible killing grandma wanted turkey. Yes, we're least double vaccinated, matter right now. Covid over. gone.  seems weird unrelated couples, great health succumb. see parent children spouses seems strange me. Even weirder it’s multigenerational.  get better better variants lucky you. way iterative systems (evolution) function, small increase fitness results variant overcoming others quite quickly. viruses fitness judged ability replicate spread, variants transmissible less deadly far better kill host (dead can't spread virus). super contagious, super deadly virus runs fuel quickly. Every mutation potential boon us (also could deadly obvious reasons, likely) history viruses reach herd immunity later transmissible less deadly stages. Yep happens focus vaccines giving old people western countries third shot give 18s rather helping countries. zero actual proof that, studies hint nothing besides Facebook memes uncle shares even point direction. particular variant coming South Africa, low vaccination number. long someone shows symptoms? Well based Moderna’s studies Delta, basically administering Delta specific booster barely effective (even infection) re-administering original vaccine booster. That’s didn’t market Delta specific booster. trouble getting third dose approved general, difference fresh variant specific dose fresh original dose wasn’t clinically demonstrated.

It sounds waning immunity would adding caseload - potentially quite bit - people feel effect unvaccinated, herd immunity drops off. previously degree protection people around them, people getting sick (but bad), risk catching disease increasing substantially. Sometimes life insane. covid means choosing mass death international travel next ten years guess international travel think know know yet I'd want hear Bill Burr ads this. 

Covidddddd ^^^^^booster. use code BURR Moderna Beta Delta variants Phase III testing according website, I’m sure develop one variant starts taking Delta. Touché Sigh… it’s South African scientists ringing alarm bells. I’m anti-Tory non-Brit be, smart move once. hasn’t shown evade vaccines. variant becomes global concern *really* bad, might cut efficacy vaccines some, probably something like 70 percent effective instead 90 percent (with boosters). That’s still great reason get vaccine vaccines far best hope going shit even worse best hope getting pandemic sooner. Nurgle you? !remindme 17 days stamp Delta. Realistically, see us stamping either. Daddy  J. powell got back free money coming way asap! Garland useless  son got vaccine recently child he's got wait quite booster (if all), yes good night cannot accepted almost two years damn pandemic people still stupid follow simple instructions. would adapt vaccine new variant vaccine people, impossible lot getting boosters now, cannot jab month so. Dont realize that?  Greek letter Nu pronounced Nee apparently. yes, Nnni!  Come Northern California. We're vaccinated. starters, state emergency called rest thst post unfounded. specifically said:

“ ignorance symptom *capitalism* forms corruption. Hence classes people classes country (third first world), something would happen healthy society takes care everyone.” 

So ignorance exist communist Vietnam it’s symptom capitalism? Could humans inherently flawed? Humans different levels intelligence, ability talent. systems try bring everyone level ultimately end everyone living poverty. Healthy capitalist societies let people successful use tax dollars created benefit everyone. country example top 10% earners generate 56% taxes 40% population pays tax all, everyone gets universal healthcare benefits   dont see whole world fully vaccinated ? data using ?  one safe everyone safe.

Noone ever safe, then. impossible put thing back genie bottle wish existence. Let's live risk Israeli PM said ""verge of"" state emergency Yeah unfortunately want lungs kill Delta variant crowded variants still variant causes 99% covid cases world. Hopefully new mutated one Delta variant crowded variants still variant causes 99% covid cases world. Hopefully new mutated one stating obvious looks really bad, damn said Lambda threat humanity Stupidity keep thing expecting different results.... whole world tried suggested. work? Exactly.

&amp;#x200B;

""Reasons"" quite valid; seeing/admitting shortsighted. We're lot better prepared least.

mRNA vaccines tweaked almost overnight, therapeutics incoming.

We'll see. restrict lives point life worth living, worth living anyway.  protection year's common strains, them.  variant even half bad reports claim suspect wont seeing open boarders yet. think concern strain, due mutations protein vaccine uses ""identifier"" COVID immune system, vaccine effective ... hence claims strain evasive immunity.

Not saying that's *for sure*, probably folks bugging. care virus care whether care not. LRC    Gupta, professor clinical microbiology Cambridge University, said work lab found two mutations B.1.1.529 increased infectivity reduced antibody recognition. ""It certainly look significant concern based mutations present,"" said. ""However, key property virus unknown infectiousness, appears primarily driven Delta variant. Immune escape part picture may happen."" complete string arguments flawed whole posting discredits itself. try drag corner discredit seemingly scientific data present a) private organization questionable goals b) completely taken context.

Your arguing tries push nazi corner, kind Holocaust neglection insult every suffer nazi regime.

You're nothing troll. hope huge mild dose immunity world worst... we'll see. first one pointing others same. Shes trying say people decided vaccine evading yet Hong Kong guys fine.

Furthermore shes pointing people saying competing delta there's literally evidence True. (and despite one case kind meaningless) hopefully points severe version. FT article graphs, says fine print extrapolation  won’t even stop long it’s *them* dying streets they’ll fine it. Remember we’re country basically said 23 dead grade school kids acceptable price pay assault style rifles. find amazing Delta variant crowded deadlier variants became dominant still dominant 99% covid cases entire world. Hopefully it’s like new variant  bundle flu shot.

Done done.   I'm wondering climate anomalies regards Spanish Flu. I've never researched personally however current climate status makes wonder. Belgian Fauci says possibly found couple cases ""UK variant"" ""Indian variant"". People going call something, better something might encourage less reliable country cover get permanently associated it. nature culled hubris. Buckle up, we’ve got yet.   Thanks links, second set particular exactly looking for. Although feel like first one drawing conclusions really supported data they're quoting. mutations may come communities willingly anti-vax

The mutations come places allowed virus spread failure politics populism (Johnson's Britain, Bolsonaro's Brazil, Moodi's India, etc.) places like SA numerous HIV immunocompromised people politicians denied existence HIV virus. thought vaccines would compensate social political failure. vaccines cannot achieve miracle long social political dysfunction continues.

The pandemic deniers antivaxxers expression social dysfunction. think functional society cope better virus even without vaccines dysfunctional vaccines. Well probably thought god killing know first appeared Africa? i'm wrong recently detected can't use conclusion Hopefully.  mutates lot? long term projection Covid? going abate time soon, also viable keep locking detriment mental health economic growth variant really negate vaccine starts spreading US, us basically go back 2020. Schools close, indoor dining, events shutdown new vaccine solution.

It sucks matter everyone vaccinated, shit still happen. know quickly make variant Covid. takes lot time effort. And, thing would called live attenuated vaccine. Hold on, already effective vaccines. lot easier skip child support federal fines. thing harder unpaid taxes. cliche corny sounds, going together. 

Idk me, still feel separated kumbaya ""together"" lot people still get vaccinated take precautions. know many mandates point i'm saying wear hazmat suit 24/7 things like, stay home sick, cover mouth cough sneeze, etc. secretly hoping Pi 3/14. mean better almost everywhere else shutdown borders. Well, articles Joe Rogan took ""horse dewormer"" didn't. took human version. difference airline usually entirely avoidable. Air travel extremely destructive. It’s cost effective HSR, example, government paying large part costs society bearing non-financial costs. Hell, would argue airlines competitive *cars* reason. Air travel incredibly ecologically destructive per mile, per person, per pound, per anything else. Air travel twice fast fastest trains earth. High speed internet connectivity reduces needs businesses rely flying people around, cost flying reflect actual costs flying. Flying entirely unnecessary luxury borne people’s desire *now* expense everything. People take real costs flying account either explicitly implicitly incorporate flying whatever aspect life thinking about.

There reason government cannot maintain programs safety infrastructure planes simply require funded airlines instead general treasury funds. social security Medicare funded. FDIC NCUA funded. myriad programs across government funded. yes, want get it, think farms required cover costs food inspection. reason meat production it’s incredibly detrimental ecological tolls borne taxpayers non-financial costs. People pay ramps choose frequent businesses built them, also tend frequented everyone, wheelchair bound. Trying ensure financial equality access disabled people enter restaurant world away subsidizing business passengers tolling earth costs ecological destruction flying, simply employer want utilize high speed internet video conferencing. 

On top that, TSA glorified jobs program exists combination security theater irrational incessant needs require people “work” (regardless pointless work is, like see TSA) get anything. NTSB incredibly cost ineffective saving lives. Airports incredibly lavish costs aren’t relevant providing flight infrastructure. lot people don’t understand point mainly helping assholes don’t care enough get vaccinated. young, got vaccinated (and boosted soon), don’t owe anything anyone. risk extremely low. SA asking slowdown vax shipments lack demand. vax availability that's issue SA, ability government convince people get vaccinated. Ok, thanks. interested hear say. set notifications on. wear shoes shoveling night soil  hell John F. Kennedy?

(Although memory serves, different scene, maybe. It’s hot minute since last saw movie.)  Well US, band BTS hosting 4 giant concerts LA fans flying world starting tomorrow 🙂 certainly help  ""Importantly, *not* mean Nu variant fully escape vaccine- infection-elicited antibodies. @PaulBieniasz @theodora_nyc shown takes many many mutations fully escape neutralization &amp; also T-cells, non-neut Abs, etc. 40% reduction Delta. wild type likely much higher. 

And data right now. see boosters changed. Also hundreds thousands migrants illegally cross UK daily, yesterday story 27 people drowning crossing Channel.  Like drifter born walk alone I’m really hoping level concern finally realized always good amount unvaccinated, majority people don’t care anymore won’t cautious, healthcare system burnt out. Here's one way *could* go well (hypothetically, maybe, data yet one way another): 

It could much lower fatality rate. Historically, tends trend among diseases. become contagious, become less fatal. (This makes sense evolution standpoint; keeping host alive provides opportunities spread.) Even 14 days still means cases even hospitalization stage yet. Deaths lag, probably mortality data weeks/months.  I’m shocked Professor Racaniello knows GTA. again, twitch discuss pandemic least early on. None friend thinks 100% immune, live normal life’s. Vaccinated people done part, longer lock up.

The pandemic around 2 years, two months, people need adapt new norm lives. 

Yes continue wear mask large gatherings, that’s it. 

People like majority. GOT OPTIMIST HERE! Hey wanna say sorry, I'm right you. know accurate sensationalized reporting yet, damn think I've thoughts along burrowed somewhere mind. People die covid, like, 2 weeks becoming ill. plenty time infect others die.  believe found already China travel contact tracing flights SA. faster delta likely late. Things rapid fire info real time hard know whats true vs still digested scientists news sources. 

But rising cases already holiday travel things unrestricted many places...so much concerned about.   No. Tuesday. know Professor Racaniello discuss Daniel Griffin Saturday podcast whoever guests Sunday podcast.

Sometimes, though rarely, put earlier podcast ready.

Edit: I’m assuming hasn’t recorded Daniel’s podcast yet, maybe Thanksgiving recorded earlier? “That would suggest may well transmissible current vaccines may well less effective.” know whether they're asymptomatic not? common cold vaccine. What? It’s fun games end dead. escape mutations Nu, BUT: ""Importantly, *not* mean Nu variant fully escape vaccine- infection-elicited antibodies. @PaulBieniasz @theodora_nyc shown takes many many mutations fully escape neutralization &amp; also T-cells, non-neut Abs, etc. (5/n)"" ROUND 5 BAYBEE Rockstar's really getting inventive new spinoff games, huh? here. periods bad I'm work two days times :( Even delusional assholes taking others   Yeah supposed easter 2020.. happen. heard april 2021 good....nope. little harder remember ""Delta""  History repeating itself... antimask movements, also anti vaccination movements...

Fun fact: Brazil antivax coz rumor vaccination done boy/girl bits ;)
I guess old school misinformation Dunno man, apocalyptic fiction fan, I'm enjoying destruction civilization  belief careless ignorant travelling continue downfall. International travel never same. TWiV discussed 529(Nu) variant yet? Trump. Looks like would Nu. 600/day last week, 2500 /day

Exponential growth slow isn't. Well wasn’t originally identified South Africa. yeah it’s already global. Business first class passengers (or even frequent flyers) usually get expedited security anyway. difference really matter minutes. me, significant proportion several-hour flight.    Flu virus though. Sure recent pandemic. 

We never global coronavirus pandemic harmful.  Well, US observing Thanksgiving. It’s regular day rest world. Easter capitalist entities well, less democracy.

A truly socialist approach would harness capacity able populations/nations collaborate research development, also resources distribution.

That so-called third-world countries big clue corrupt world is. Please don’t call variants initial country identification. moved that.

We don’t call delta variant Indian variant.  got third phizer shot today hope everyone else too. need stay safe variants  shake tree get stocks cheaper everything time high ? oh reduce consumption reduce inflation bring oil prices ? almost always South Africa come waves, black death plague lasted hundreds years. Well, partially responsible seemingly neverending mess. criticized somehow. point become different virus? False. social animals, humans rely one another community strategies/work solve problems attain healthiest states cooperation.

What gets way corruption, stems exposure corruption childhood abuse, takes many forms. society overwhelmed abusiveness, people denial enabling. Hence typical response abuse victims speak pretend they're somehow lying mistaken. Almost nobody feels, subconsciously, handle extent damage (to individuals, groups world). media fear mongering and/or clickbait? article stated facts. “worst far” literally quote UK government. don’t problem worldwide people overplaying virus. problem people underplaying it. Unearned lol don’t agree he’s worked harder u life time know mere thank falls short, us appreciate everything you, nurses, doctors us. I'm fully vaccinated still wear mask whenever go out. blame feelings rate feels like we're fighting losing battle. feel weird story dropped right heart thanksgiving. I’m sure bad timing feels odd. That’s honestly quite bit lower expecting. wonder boosters bump significantly? get worms then? would go that?   Africa 50+ countries, larger UK. new variant found Southern Africa (5-10 countries depending count them), ravaged virus. 

My sister lives there, went couple harrowing weeks earlier year, lost several friends (and acquaintances), people 30-40es.. Shut ya borders! Time long SPY then, they're nervous best time buy first person furry?? Yes, terms physical size virus, same. difference mutated better infect us. N95 mask identically effective stopping transmission. Thanks this, least get sleep now. election win, let's open up.  sure mutations usual. probably came person immune system problems SA estimation looking high HIV cases there. said immune system can't stop virus correctly, replicate lot suddenly body training field it. I'm not. Neither things assumed.   Hours. Wow, good point--there could sorts weird little (yet crucial) bottlenecks production even involving virus itself. full understanding issues poorer countries. highlighted situation here. eyes, duty government protect citizens good can. also includes third shots needed.
But also includes vaccination rest world! could even think unable vaccinate population?
I opinion functioning, well organized fully vaccinated Germany COULD much rest world chaotic mess right now.
Is world wide, internationally funded vaccination biggest money providers also richest countries.

But politicians failed domestically get ppl vaccinated. loads scandals bribery shit. can't efficiently help anyone can't fix shit. expect incompetent ppl manage vaccination far away countries? required infrastructure mostly even available (Germany mainly uses biontech. Needs super cooling).

Again. order protect population pandemic, MUST protect population countries.
It would super important get everyone vaccinated, currently also use vaccines thought first/second jabs third shots stay well expected vaccination rates. vaccines can't simply shipped ""somewhere"" injected random ppl know else last 2 years taught us expensive? Large numbers people getting sick dying.     Nu variant could Belgium already. Two COVID tests currently analyzed. Result known today. Perhaps punishment, species, disrespecting science  region reported 5 COVID deaths yesterday. would lot useful take time explain happened 5 ppl. 85? 21 night club last week? Man, vaccine took months ago looking weaker soon useless every passing week. tired loosing hope things getting better, cannot see end this.

You’ve severely misunderstood discussions waning immunity vaccines. scares things get simplified headlines.

**The vaccine still extremely effective preventing illness, hospitalization death,** even reduced rate compared initial protection. extend regarding origin virus. mean animals humans interact directly indirectly got infected - matter time. white deer study shows fast spread. time surrounded many virus variations need entirely new generation vaccines. Researchers working already - might get time. Let's settle friend. WAY early make predictions like that.

Most like answers questions no.   rich must holiday, poor must die. hope call Peppa Pig variant. Even last night, reading UK issuing red advisory Israel going restrict travel. knew mutations weren’t sure meant virus infectious evaded vaccines. It’s Floridians spend year outside.  already aged like milk new variant. Sorry, virus doesn’t give fuck want lives go back was.   points encouraging. problem US, friend. need pan galactic gargle blaster reading it.  South Africa enough vaccines….. look up. Looks like Israel ahead game preparation potential variant like this: think flying high around Delta / initial vaccine rollout. 
We made future looked bright. 
We winning. 
That course didn’t happen, sounds really undo lot accomplished. lab cheap. scientist want premium coffee blend. Agree misallocation resources.
However, nurses aren’t trained overnight immigration laws make importing skills difficult Good thing aren’t global pandemic normal times.  Why? current vaccine target multiple strains, would new one less? Mutations likely people harbour virus long time compromised immune systems. yes, real breeding ground infection mutation unvaccinated population. Let's build houses quicksand, have. exact kind utter nonsense hate online dialog. clearly know nothing subject, yet spout authoritatively.

There's actually enormous abundance nurses US. One 100 people registered nurse.

The nursing shortages entirely due fact nurses left bedside care due BS deal understaffing, poor compensation, terrible shifts/hours, abusive management patients.

The ""nursing shortage"" much myth current labor shortage. There's shortage nurses current pay rates. It’s definitely moment like that, guess bright side vaccines work one eventually come this. We’ve made OG version big, scary Delta jaguar hopefully playing safe, we’re situation lot people probably let guard due vaccine. assume (if probably window now) hits, it’ll probably hard enough put us back “slowing spread” days people never want go back to.

I imagine reactions mixed Nu Variant, lot resistance measures people hated past fatigued, etc. I’m ready continue playing safe (VACCINE, masks, social distancing order) unsure are, too.

While typing this, [this notification came pretty much confirms terms reaching everywhere already. Guess got strap ride another wave. Would CFR lower due effect vaccines? Yes, businesses rely tourists, fuck people, save businesses profit!!! - governments Delta already arguably contagious measles, simply short generation time, 4 days versus 11. Gamma Latin America. bad, child play delta. That's right, reason usually tetanus shot date someone reminds me. Last time went local clinic nurse one look vacine bulletin started screaming couple years behind tetanus, jabbed arm sent way. Im surprised suggest previous comment call global lockdown, reminder CDC, others NPIs combination vaccines. true poor countries struggle lockdowns, ultimatively virus destroys economy, NPIs though. advertise stop efforts claim someone repeating CDC recommendations pro-global-lockdown. strategy push opposite viewpoints extreme corners tries discredit disingenious.
Furthermore duty rich countries enable efficient vaccination process poor countries, yet underway.   even then, vaccination requirement becomes 90% total population (for perfect vaccine) feasible stop it. take heard word since moved Texas.   It’s usually decent predictor what’s come….   even cell escape

Source? Smallpox different animal, vaccinated people sterilizing immunity. doesn’t mean anything. That’s happened delta previous variants well. need larger data set know evades immunity.  Agree number based inadequate data. Like growth cases people started actually testing New York, made seem like doubling times short. Still, combinatation short generation times high infectivity already makes Delata arguably communicable virus ever seen. gets worse, really need game, least hit standards Venice early fifteenth century. think one isn’t different, haven’t paying attention aren’t trained overnight

You need train new ones, need increase compensation longer practice (a number equal bedside) longer see bedside practice shit deal. chuckled. Damn, that's funny. deaths far? kill specifically deadlier general, health care lot less advanced then? Covid likely killed 11-20 million far based excess deaths, knows much longer last, could eventually get Spanish Flu levels globally. US Covid already met surpassed deaths Spanish Flu. That's godawful modern medicine effective treatments. clicked link exacted damn thought. That's I'm looking for! discussion nobody mentions bit.  actually overabundance nurses, look numbers insane number longer practicing, largely reasons described above. Certainly many would return bedside compensation worthwhile. *Its mutant strain March 2020.... Alpha v1... incubated someone(s) HIV long time apparently. almost 2 years perculating.....* Belgium saw record number infections, hospitals numbers higher worst case scenario two weeks front ""expected amount hospitalisations"". 


Meanwhile resistance new measurements rise faster ever.  


This without taking account new ""Nu"" variant. two possible cases ""Nu"" labo KU Leuven. 


IF continues everyone cured, vaccinated (or death) quote german minister.  FDA takes things seriously good reason. reason US one countries without tens thousands thalidomide babies. UK EU tens thousands born without hands, arms, legs. bit caveat here; cases delta super low variant. it’s hard say it’s outcompeting, wasn’t much competition begin with. love responses automatically dismisses anything unimportant moral high ground. course everything small besides death, shitty argument. maddening aspect refuse learn horrors people like gone through. 

A prominent corporate exec company 50's died horrible, excruciating death still high ranking people opposed anything prevent spread COVID. 

If variant truly worse (in every regard) Delta propagates across planet, way society (mis)handled pandemic point, we're absolute horror show. Yes Delta 3 spike mutations compared original strain. one around 30.

There's Twitter graph floating around shows theoretical responsive monoclonal antibody treatments new strain. think something like 2 8 major ones predicted work.

So horrible, least two seem respond, theoretically. rest adjusted changed necessary take bit time. remember 15 thinking smart. Sick sick - song 1977 punk band Remember. going permanent change now. people making policy making sound bites clearly lack insight human nature, that’s disturbing.

Ironically uk waited longer expert's said people accept long term lockdowns. way length people would accept starting show now. Ah yes, pure unadulterated logic must see clear line descendants criminals malleable population. I’m seems little rash. don’t know anything variant different spike proteins may resist vaccine. time, virus could much less infectious weaker due modification. Well dooooooooooommmmm OP recently ready thing. Infact saw study children actually think ""long-covid"" caused disease living pandemic. control group equal number kids report long-covid symptoms despite never getting COVID. Yes, seems right. Lower average population age, lower access good health care, lower vaccination access, lower reporting accuracy, etc. guys… mean, yes, getting vaccinated important, point going start talking figuring therapies effectively treating deadliest symptoms COVID?

About 2 years ago, people talking that, they've working hard ever since. We've got something good monoclonal antibodies, even stronger pills coming line cut deaths even - effective. ones already approved UK, waiting FDA US. yet government (Ontario, Canada) still let everyone 6 months dose 2 get booster. Probably, Hong Kong cases flew already two weeks ago. Lets hope variant bad statistics make seem. Roughly half people infected Covid feel zero symptoms. rate skews even higher lower age infected yet see anything haw triple vaxed would fare. Plus SA 20% vax rate, really enough data yet varent fare highly vaxed country. sending clear signal country reports new variant risk excluded world. Best stay quiet, particularly rich country.  find it’s way there, like Delta did. WTF AIDS Covid? downvoted bit, eat it, IDGAS. Faster spread bad healthcare infrastructure

What I'm wondering kind trade-off transmissibility harmfullness. understanding, SARS-COV-2 pretty harmless compared original SARS, way contagious, leading huge epidemic law large numbers means health care systems collapse. now, vague idea contagousness, nothing harmfullness. So, fingers crossed, maybe variant spreads super fast everyone light cough time. know actually. looked credentials, seems competent. he? technically doesn’t qualify FDA approval vaccine 40% reduction transmission Yesterday reading started laughing hysterically… it’s stressful, maybe make peace fact get it. contagious delta immune evasive like completely different animal. restrictions keep coming people edge, edge, tired stressed. tell it’s safety, doesn’t feel safe all. point close society forever live like miserable people, economic activity happening hospitals cruise ships going SA FL? Exactly. I'll definitely take vaccine first kids since I'm much likely get really sick can't fend themselves. mostly bullshit. described what's happening unskilled labor markets right now. 

Doctors nurses highly trained skilled. excess nurses doctors waiting around home pay go enter workforce. 

What's going hospitals labor supply problem due bad compensation due sudden increased demand. economist boomer souece? Crap, I'm getting old. Could also since spreads fast, might able achieve sort herd immunity. Obviously, ideal scenario since many people get sick. going ravage world fast, might come immunity. get help picture arising Hong Kong cases indicates bypasses protection infection fairly easily. Great.

The thing left wait outcomes. also bypasses protection hospitalization might truly fucked. know feel. I'm ICU nurse. I'm however ortho nurse. see COVID patients, seeing lot people quitting/leaving jobs. stressful understaffed get. 4/6 confused patients sitters/telesitters day (2 recovering much narcotics, close aaxo3, thank god). last day. I've worked beginning pandemic, must admit I'm wit's end myself. I'm taking months COVID winter hits. can't take much this.... God bless everyone still working. Christmas travel around corner, too.

Governments react slowly enough infected people slip through.

If real escape variant take least 2 months new targeted vaccine engineered distributed (based Pfizer said previously) so, well...  Countries banning travel now. Sure, know sure, absolutely cannot ruled out. simply seen long enough know long term effects.

I'm 30s 40s, every single scientist thought cigarettes perfectly fine, entire generation started dying lung cancer 55. rapid ascent Nu 1% 90% cases South Africa suggests much, much higher transmission rate delta, already much higher others. Feels like taken multiple steps back possibility herd immunity, even possibility low-grade steady state.  headmovie makes eyes rain Ive following night escalating really fast sound it. wild. variants named Greek letters. Nu next letter alphabet (after last variant concern, Mu). would logical would next variant concern that, Nu is. already found multiple countries, probably already rapidly spreading everywhere now. Stopping flights might slow gonna able keep forever. would this. 

The number conspiracy nuts refuse vaccine, smoke, drugs drink heavily ridiculous!  Let guess it’s worse others like ones that, it’ll take another Vaccine new vaccine that’ll mandated order enjoy regular freedoms… power play getting old. I’d rather die feet live knees point. isn’t shine serious thing I’m maybe beer two, sorry offend. Also, held elections weeks ago. Lots political gatherings rallies past months, people rallies wearing masks all. Good see someone else calmly talking sense. many people jumping straight panic mode this. already spreading. Looking past new variants came ongoing thing act fast enough. already spreading. :Remind 2 weeks Well, yes.

But thinking Marvin (the Paranoid Android). 

Sheesh, that's second *Hitchiker's* reference I've made one day. 

Perhaps time hydrate eat lots peanuts?

Terrible thing is, nobody electronic thumb. 

We've got find Ford. late already countries banned travel  fact capitalist society less democratic system. world capitalist. corruption everywhere. Every human system power dynamics, thus attracts corrupt people, quite numerous.

If world coordinated collaborated, best vaccines would developed shared every human. Unfortunately science driving decisions, issue inherently political. Slowing economy hurts profits, safety net folks without work. 

Yet, pandemic needs less interpersonal contact. beneficial social contact least useful economy (e.g. visiting family). jobs would triaged society indefinitely science made mandatory economy.

It's coincidence countries reliant tourism handled lockdowns best. loss profits/work already guaranteed. depends region. Germany really much issue. one major political party even tried make issue, shut pretty quickly.  we're never going stop spreading anyway surely matters deadly is. infectious less deadly variant good thing getting pandemic long term.  Lol zero optimism. I'm shit I'm trying end pandemic 😂 need public patient huh? Guess we're screwed then. Delta already transmissible measles according Larry Brilliant Bubble podcast. Measles higher R0 Delta faster actually incubate become contagious.

If that's true though, people focused R0 stat actually takes time account? get it. mean drugs alternative though. meant using drugs vaccines would stop pandemic rather vaccines alone What’s evidence got Egypt Belgium point? Sorry, able read article easily. western world high vaccination rates? :)

It also feels like 2 years, lockdowns started (at least western world) around March 2020, right? like 1.5?

Our life much better ... shall pass. thank god Still passing lot people believe cloth mask = N95 mask. HK case caught Malawi. least Africa now. Calm tits. Anecdotal, long covid months ago feel fully recovered terms stamina. 

Mild case last November. Hiked around Yosemite pushing stamina limits months prior knew exactly badly long covid affected it. Probably lasted least 6 months. Greatly impacted stamina, chest sensitive medications impacted blood pressure too. Could hardly hike mile completely winded. got sick anything non-covid body started COVID-like symptoms (which chalked damage covid caused. partner went similar thing me.

But since late summer we've completely recovered feel like stamina back used be.

Now obviously, mild case doubt there's small complication might I'm older affecting it. terms feeling recovered long covid completely going 6-8 months, rest assured happened us! that's case clearly happens doubt lot people genuinely recover it. depends bad got suppose. Hell yeah new lockdown horizon yeah...... mountain dew variants They’re trying stop it, slow spread. much Biden states like Texas Florida absolutely whatever overwhelm hospital systems. would racist. can’t see end? That’s good, end begin with. fear porn, never end start living life. vaccines end anything, obvious point. see conflicting info boosters fully effective, say starting 6 days others 7 others say 14 days. LOOOOOOOL Yea, media motivated clicks eyeballs absconded moral purpose informing public. Yes. European wave Delta. bit counter point 500 number, well severity. Caveat really know yet  new strain contagious think (RO 40) Covid done months Either way, seems like it’d live 24/7 office like half 2021. can't lock borders US, precedent set racist. continued let unvaccinated people southern border even peak delta, US much actually stop this. going count EU rest world matter lock countries active US well practically guarantee starts spreading US eventually late dudes Nu outcompete anything, popped relative void variants. 

It still seems like indicates Nu contagious. infection rates super low SA, spike Nu less transmissive delta? What's frustrating lately... live Germany where, many countries across Europe, covid cases surging restrictions lockdowns implement.

Now, I'm taking precautions, firmly believe everyone get vaccination. However, can't help upset seeing Americans living life like normal —no masks, concerts &amp; sporting events full capacity — Europe still need mask everywhere, higher vaccination rate, months can't go hardly establishment without presentation proof vaccination, negative test, recovery... Yet somehow incident rate multitudes higher US?

Maybe enough Americans infected already there's natural immunity? Maybe cases US underreporting? know I'm seriously sick lockdowns. Covid never going away, ever. We're lucky enough opportunity get vaccinated. point time accept covid part life on. need get back normal. Two years counting lockdown madness seriously making lose mind. Thanks, makes sense. Let's hope another VOC. Yes. Worry help.  think matter one other, think would effective together Yes   would mean cancelling going Strasbourg MEPs staff one complain about. maybe help reaching carbon neutrality 🤣 /s vitally important keep mind individual traveled Egypt, **unvaccinated**. nothing else, speaks need far stricter policies allowing unvaccinated people travel, also adds badly needed context headline. also know sure person got severely ill not, originally article published French badly worded. submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* updated side, web going crazy news it. following closely day. Apologies it’s likely already North America EU go anyway, probably got vaccine protected possible severe illness.  lesser extent, certainly, similar situation Germany. 

The AfD (our far-right party) vehemently anti-vax ""sceptical"" shit. places voted getting hit hardest current wave. 

But clear cut US, part simply parties turn, polarisation much less pronounced. ""left gets vaccinated ok, right (conservative) getting fucked"" generally holds true, though. point, nobody knows. experts ""concerned.""

Via new variant, B.1.1.529, “very unusual constellation mutations,” 30 spike protein alone, according Tulio de Oliveira, director KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation Sequencing ACE2 receptor — protein that [helps create entry coronavirus infect human cells — new variant 10 mutations. comparison, Beta variant three Delta variant two, Mr. de Oliveira variant shares similarities Lambda Beta variants, associated innate evasion immunity, said Richard Lessells, infectious diseases specialist KwaZulu-Natal Research Innovation Sequencing “All things give us concern variant might enhanced transmissibility, spread efficiently, might also able get around parts immune system protection immune system,” Dr. Lessells said. No, vaccines still measure impede spread virus outside lockdowns. what’s more, vaccination massively reduces risk getting seriously ill individual, risk health systems collapsing strain.

For example, person article vaccinated. was, perhaps would still caught it, would less likely.

It great drugs developed well. Vaccines perfect people cannot vaccinated. Medication save many lives cases. rather alternative vaccines, additional layer protection, safety net.

Like, seatbelts important safety feature, don’t replace brakes. Hopefully political left cry ""racism"" idea restricting travel another nation time. Could saved lot lives first time. remember too. That’s beauty amazing technology. hope almost future vaccines adopt method. issue getting people take it.  they’re looking now, likely find something. However, it’s places while, see explosive growth described Africa, based small sample small denominator. present lot places say past week three without huge growth fact reassuring. present places showing quickly not. Time tell  Uhm... Unvaccinated people shouldnt allowed travel continents pandemic. symptomatic variant easier detect earlier on, cause spread less contact tracing, could create evolutionary pressure towards less severe variants. symptoms least somewhat correlated likelyhood death.  Nu variant?  Closing couple days false scare orders magnitude less negative impacts allowing chance one highly transmissible viruses known mankind spread. Compared last year, places board shutting workplaces tons COVID protections.

Now ton mindset undone said protections gone, people showing work sick school sick. calm everyone Damn. May well meme that. Also untrue, lots vaccinated people hospitalized Delta. 

Yes, probability far less unvaccinated also 0.

If Nu worse Delta, especially find way past waning efficiency vaccines, it’s easy enough math. FuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuUUuuuuuuuuuck Oh phew spotted gene fingerprints? a) person apparently unvaccinated (what hell travelling?)

b) There's confusion whether person seriously ill Note traveller returned Egypt. Belgium caught early excellent detection system covid variants. Make mistake, already everywhere across world. True, mortality COVID right isn’t high enough effect transmissibility. probably room become deadly starts hinder infectivity. saying will, *could* become severe. could also show lower symptoms, slight antibody evasion, increased transmissibility. argument again. evolutionary pressure become less deadly virus kills slow corona. Look long incubation period. Transmission happens usually person gets ill it. Hence pressure less pathogenic. No, ~~the Democrats~~ Trump's fault many Americans died.

Fixed you. lol, yes, American horrified collective lack concern! head narrator says “there before, now” pan TV showing montage bad news, headlines, drama turmoil. feels like “before” gone it’s depressing.  Belgian Fauci sounds like dessert fancy restaurant. Yes; steroids given treat covid-19, causes immunosuppression makes people vulnerable worms. “Our immediate concern damage decision cause tourism industries businesses countries.”  

So, ever was….  

However, jump ahead even number days / hours, could net positive effect global damage mitigation.  
It sucks South Africa could make countries less transparent future find new variants.  
It’d awesome world could agree system bounty paid nations raise hand new variant caught measures implemented contain it. 
I’m ignorant think could ever actually work, perfect world sure sounds nice. doomed. 1 case means already here.  main thing we're infected ignorance.

I can't believe still unvaxxed people USA. folks live separate reality insanity we've decided normalize like everything else. media going love one. ""The Nu Variant Dominating New Year"" ""New Year, Nu Variant"" ""The Nu Year Variant"" Ah shit, go I'm fine either outcome [Movie Covid-24 getting real We've learned nothing pandemic. continue make mistakes over. Omega This. already permanent side effects something else handle another chronic illness. I'm vaccinated (plus boosters) never leave house without mask. live fear, feel worry? Yes. healthy, fully vaccinated people concerned

So hell fully vaccinated people underlying conditions then? Could explain details, please? would like understand thought better. Never fails. likely money makers banks deep shite making bad bets. right answer. can't get understanding lethal virus short time frame Spanish flu pandemic still us it’s 100 years.   angry? 

Maybe time look again? Look yourself.  I’m dense slow understand, tell don’t get. I’m fucking tired this. 😩 bunch fear-mongering.

Look folks, NEVER going away. We're going live it.

Now grow F up, stop acting like bunch ninnies. decisive response used to, really likely already might drugs. Merck's full data came turns pill 30% effective (v hospitalization/death) vs original estimate 50%. see final Pfizer results (and whether produced quickly enough help Netherlands? boosters kids 2nd dose 2 days. think current wave could avoided bosters child vaccines available September. Unfortunately real reason expect easily transmissible variant less deadly. Covid deadly enough killing host much impact spread.

Delta infectious causes severe symptoms.

Of course, could lucky.... Ok, tried positive... we're fucked...

Absolutely make every day freedom left. I'm holding variant corrects astigmatism.  :: looks Greek letter Nu ::

Well, likely use *that* one either. ~~probably~~ us already… Yes, flu-like symptoms, serious illness, according article know we're older know we're dumb shitpost day. It’s like TWD

Everyone infected Glad someone took time dig deeper. spidey senses tingling stats spreading ability v. Delta could since far knew countries Africa done surprisingly well avoiding major Delta waves. I'm trying undermine importance variant, take word worst possible thing world? scientist working covid, someone helping vaccine distribution? seem someone important position way introduced first sentence B.1.1.529 safe thing quarantine test everyone, allowing community. limited data right looks like best treat like separate disease. 

I think see cases break non-Afican countries. next days. tip iceberg view. Luckily European countries type lockdown keep things bit controllable. 

The upside happening know lot avoid infection. rules apply. missing something here, get everything negative right find mutation less deadly great news getting pandemic LONG TERM.

I thought way every pandemic ends virus keeps mutating infectious less deadly variant. become clear recently can't beat immunity (eg look Gibraltar) eventually need variant gives people immunity much less likely kill/hospitalise you. 

Obviously know yet as/more deadly terrible news wait see. seems misunderstood. “taking precautions” didn’t mean hide house like hermit avoiding human contact. meant simple wearing mask, getting vaccinated, getting booster. I’m visiting family got hug mom first time year. Markets already freaking sure hope so. may true. concerns every variant. it’s confirmed that’s case, can’t muster energy worry one yet. I’m vaxxed, I’m boosted, I’m gonna hope means I’m protected. around forever basically kiss year round non emergency medical care goodbye. People think easy virus beat vaccines make totally useless. far there's cases virus vaccines signs happening, never said concerning matter. said far **proof** likely happen. UK saying one variant investigation, let's see say. correlation worms covid-19?

Otherwise, ivermectin treats people worms, regardless covid-19, i’m sure significant. may understood correctly, but, 


The mRNA vaccines working accordingly spike protein virus. People concerned variant many mutations spike protein **may** better escaping immunity created vaccine. 


Is types vaccines (AZ, Sputnik, Sinopharm, Sinovac...)? VT still good indicator highly vacinated community fare this. high case counts, among lowest hostpital rates US. Never leave earth without 👍 Yes think there's general misunderstanding. feel like trying say current reduction transition general basis. really understand take basis. individual boostered 6 months? would make somewhat senses numbers would covered studies. not. actual stakes here. Hospitals Minnesota fucked right now.

It shitty argument. actual stakes situation. children ""sick it"" deciding act like stakes changed. Yeah apparently Belgium already needs spreading enough likely enough random Belgian tourist Egypt contact it.

Yes, go SA Egypt 5-6 hours plane, likely enough people carrying variant European tourist would get close enough contact one get infected herself? likely imo. likely community spreading already happening Egypt elsewhere Africa, cannot happen hours.

Plus experts suggesting genetic profile indicates around  America: ""Challenge accepted"" mean immunologically naïve. Hey I’m
So
Sorry. must incredibly hard child 💓 fairly decent vaccination rate.

You still get it? obtuse. Boosters still recommended areas world, entirely shocking boosted some, mitigation 'flu' never worry... overweight ass gets fairness, learned Wuhan, time enough cases notice, already late. Biden UAW asks went PACU 7 years ICU COVID. couldn’t either. I’ve much happier ever since. virus potentially deadly &amp; dangerous transmissible &amp; vaccine resistant? (Not saying serious latter, neither good, want know more). mean picked places - I'd looking airports planes right likely sources personally.

Either way, good. Symptomatic? Mayo Clinic: ‘Most people coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover completely within weeks’  local numbers indicate wear mask avoid crowds, that's do. many times explained you?  way Could. don’t think much evolutionary pressure happen, unfortunately. could theoretically happen, would random mutation paired another mutation makes transmissible. 

But I’m layman. Someone qualified, feel free chime in. Theoretically could transmissible less lethal right? Evidence seems show transmissible says nothing severity cases? problem seen movie before.  downvotes. mean comment speculation, posts think 2020 again.

Everyone go get boosted!  watch stocks end green AH everyone realises one knows anything  thinking 57% percent Republican, certainly US. Yeah, know many us feel unfair, frankly speaking - life, way existed throughout duration life planet. disease, famine; famine, war. Life risky business - many us get alive.  Really. fear mongering needs stop. people get Covid, die, terrible side effects. get Covid 65, likely die get long Covid. 

This say shouldn’t get vaccinated shouldn’t cautious, goodness people, isn’t smallpox anthrax. Let’s keep grounded. David Nabarro appropriate concerned – tell why. virus looks like greater capacity evade defenses we’ve built result vaccinations we’ve received since beginning year, concern would mean, it’s bit like reset dial go back start dealing totally new pandemic again, treat new virus, that’s concern.” like positive thinking! Specifically old Pyrex. Since 80s lot made soda-lime. Supposedly resistant breaking drop less resistant breaking thermal shock. obviously has. everyone thinking spreading like wild fire already around bit  gladly pay subscriptions NYT Guardian.

But every site allow visits month free. many general public going subscribe Economist. 

I've never seen this, I'd happy pay per view content want read. Like $1. variants concern get named Greek letters. points fact new variant spreading time across continent

doesnt need spread spread far today.

you go side world mere hours. also wears 


Understandable. little. Specially 70 years old. increase ICU occupancy mostly caused people vaccinated. netherlands, death count low (slightly larger common flu), suspect healthcare system large Germany, something. much much lower count Germany, Austria, say Eastern Europe (because people vaccinated).

And nu variant, comes, way even best protection enough evade endemic. delta variant, vaccines barely enough limitting worst outcomes. variant 2-3 times contagious, even more, way.

I think need focus avoiding death let go idea stop becoming endemic. exactly true, people reactionary panicky, often oversell overbuy stocks every uncertainity fuels wildest imagination contemplating thing. hope right! wonder honestly going do?

I’ve sort let level control guidance they’ve beginning pandemic. Maybe didn’t really understand role. general they’ve seemed sort “impotent” don’t know wrong perception never properly understood role. Even ultra fast spread, take weeks reach real spread US. Maybe time Christmas?

I think political environment favorable closures. Unfortunately think wait see matching death spike vaccinated countries people react… might late.

So eyes Israel high vaccination rate countries bell weathers play out. growth rate matters, absolute number cases. final flush. already big trouble  “common cold” set viruses similar symptoms. It’s severe enough really warrant real medical treatment identification.

But identify it, time got cold it’d different one. Belgium. somebody fully vaccinated, dealing acute bronchitis week, feel targeted. :)

it’s frustrating dealing “good old fashioned” illness year half free flu colds.  lethal  
we die

Pick one.  wasn’t meant asked something new xmas. “…both willingness receive vaccine actual vaccination rates date lower, average, counties majority residents voted re-elect former President Donald J. Trump 2020.”

[Least Vaccinated U.S. Counties Something Common: Trump antiviral drugs don’t care spike mutations.... sooooooo? care covid? drugs really bring back feels pandemic first started. said, FUCK. infectious less severe need hope for. would amazing change....the variant truly need take over. around since LEAST November 11, would’ve significant amount cases variant countries going severe Delta wave.

No, necessarily. takes time minimal introduction cases seed new mutations country. beginning introduction delta theorized cases keep certain threshold, iirc around 10%, delta taking hold could've averted.
Every country different, depends pocket society gets introduced, natural immunity vaccination status on. also reports delta UK took hold developing clusters highly unvaccinated subgroups. Furthermore genomic surveillance analyzes fraction total cases. info French patient question young unvaccinated woman travelled back Belgium Egypt 11 days ago Turkey. never visited countries southern Africa.

Dont wear mask either, kids do, wish state would enforce actually, since kids dont really mind it. Here's thought.... exactly ended Spanish flu pandemic. highly transmissible less severe. Covid rolling 2 years. Cases worldwide unknown. vaccine ... Past positive cases transmission virus. *COULD* variant gets us finally. virus want continue kill host. I'm saying thoughts obviously .... virus survive needs somewhere live. Less severe transmissible would god send right signal end.

Obviously one clue ... playing hopeful card. people haven’t gotten booster yet they’re place hasn’t authorized yet, I’m assuming they’re still protected hospitalization/death even comes new variants right, cells? wanna asume problem would breakthrough infections please correct I’m wrong Rookie move, started mutation Madagascar Belgium, yeah matter time everywhere girlfriend immunocompromised vaccine didn’t create immune response. pills, work her, would huge. get tested potential symptom. Colorado hospitalized people COVID point pandemic Colorado Great Lake states requesting national guard assistance staffing beds. Acting like don’t problem we’re treating people there’s many COVID patients hospitals asinine. COVID last Christmas. got booster two days ago still mild fever arm sore. I'm pro vaccine come booster really hit hard. really trying rehash 2020 play Zero COVID fantasy game again? never realistic option considering long China tried tamp information regarding COVID beginning. spreading wild long proper testing system place contact trace.

Also, there's insane amount entitlement think average person could economically survive locking two months. entire global economy would need change OVERNIGHT UBI based system ensure avoided mass starvation events. 

Even fantasy lockdown, someone still grocery store checkout counter, etc. means spread vectors still exist. 

The Perfect Lockdown never existed realistic outcome. fear fear fear fear  soon till get special Omicron boosters? Yey moar boosters! Get shot! course unvaccinated person 🤦‍♂️ Upon entering military service people get staggering number vaccinations, I've never seen evidence anything bad immune systems. 

So, long know immune system benefit new vaccines (similar get flu vaccine every year) feel confident getting additional shots. limit. Sure can, countries time. Granted easier nothing ever 100% I'm talking legal entry non essential travel.

Feel that…. want buy house woods come back years  doctor scientist don’t know.

So pretend one now? old Commodore 64 felt that. Literally nowhere avoided covid. Like I’m defending US’s lackluster response no, couldn’t avoided. That's point. Nobody would care Covid everyone got every year .01% mortality rate. It'd cold. viruses ultimately end becoming. Ending week high note..aren't we?

Just admin actually halted travel doesn’t mean it’s right decision. Go see doctor. Try get guidance help mental health.
If can't afford that, try online mental health app.
If work, try magic mushrooms maybe?

As someone there, hardest step admitting bad place. done that, take next step. Well 2 years pandemic people still alive fine. even looking teeth. 

Youl shot 23 still watching neighbours doing. day hammering delayed day bought preparation. I’d much rather get Covid now, various treatments better knowledge progresses, back March 2020. Fyi...
The official said restrictions apply South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, Malawi “implemented abundance caution light new COVID-19 variant circulating Southern Africa.”
The policy ban flights apply American citizens lawful permanent residents, official said. United States lifted travel restrictions South Africa Nov. 8. want ride One scientists helped develop Moderna vaccine explicitly stated media guilty fear mongering right Omicron. need test someone know they're dead not. also understand fundamentals evolution.

diseases evolve become less deadly lethality reduces reproduction, covid spreads *days* ever show symptoms, usually die weeks contracting it, lethal interferes incubation spreading period evolutionary pressure become less lethal. 

there massive amount room covid become far deadly inhibits contagiousness. That's matters care letting unvaccinated people travel  gift keeps giving ugh US shut this? Thank god add Virginia list soon. Thankfully elected youngkin don’t scared locked again! Pathetic. link study showing this?

6 months ago right you. real world data I've seen seem show vaccines stopping transmission hospitalizations, reducing them. many people would throw fit 😔 hate  You’re getting downvoted Americans refuse live real world. people accuse everyone else “being scared” ones terrified weird me, get vaccinated, wear mask listen experts, question experts might influenced Russian propaganda.

Yes that’s decent example places (much like delta variant India poor public health sanitation issues original virus China disgusting unregulated wet markets likely origin virus) breed spread types germs whether bacteria viruses. places focused heavily sanitation like South Korea China saw cases drop heavily early on. It’s gonna tough situation developing nations manage country pandemic starting worsen again. It’s downward spiral issues feed sadly developing countries like SA can’t vaccinate people, poor sanitation, overcrowding, poorly educated protecting one’s health general public, poor desperate economies, mass insecurity, breeding ground deadlier variants, heavily dependent foreign aid economies, lack PPE resources, political instability distrust, lack obedience compliance laws mandates, list goes on. Huh, never realized Charleston Huntington close population. grew Ohio side Huntington always perceived Charleston much bigger. first cases COVID-19 probably USA November December 2019. know better.  Actually, examine types mutations variant, ideas means; virologists, news agencies, first sounded alarm stated significantly different strain. flood mostly unvaccinated covid-19 patients

Whelp... COVID killed, say, 20% people infects still contagious Delta, probably would seen governments moving crush extreme measures like martial law. Nah ever end unless variant transmissible less lethal. case, probably spread everyone actually make sick long able fight (even immunocompromised people). alone terrifying ""boots ground"" basis. example, took wife dentist yesterday, notice 80% patients refused wear masks none staff wore face shields. Imagine stronger communicable Delta variant half populace reacts way. AFAIK, mostly raw transmissibility. one strain R0 2, another one R0 4, latter always win eventually. Yep. hell wrong world letting unvaccinated people fly countries  real reason we're panicking new variant people STILL refuse get vaccinated. According one Moderna's researchers twitter, t-cell immunity vaccine still appears strong new variant (t-cell immunity prevents breakthrough infections large severe), issue still many people South Africa U.S refuse get vaccinated.  read mutations variant. know journalists? think meant 'transit hub' opposed destination; Dubai major transit hubs. I've reading new strains last two months, first time I'm really worried. point gotta fear mongering B... b... thought vaccines same? That's telling along whatever vaccine get matter.

What load horseshit. virulent mild complete opposites. virulent means severe symptoms. we've already learned already every where. Wow dude, say anything lock scared. dramatic much? Also I’ve enjoying life traveling across Europe past month husband safe using precautions testing every days. Let guess, idea “living life” what…going work 9-5, going bar watching big game boys? Woooo fucking hooo. 

I’m saying Europe seeing digital COVID passes masks used compared shit show home states stark comparison. seeing unhinged seemed response shows you’ll completely miss nuance I’m saying. please go yelling sky falling libs whatever gets off. 

Edit: didn’t even look profile realize life care bunch millionaires playing football, lol. Maybe practice preach get more. “life” thing yell others about. Lol.   Correct. still could become deadly, mutations random. That’s happened Delta. pressure become severe, luck draw, did. mistaken. Even Poland sequence lot currently. AfD (our far-right party) vehemently anti-vax ""sceptical"" shit

Water wet. KNOW IM LITERALLY FREAKING INTERNALLY RAPIDS, Mich. — Spectrum Health, major health-care system here, officials spent part last week debating whether move “red status” show strained hospitals flood mostly unvaccinated covid-19 patients arriving emergency departments already packed people suffering medical issues, sending capacity unprecedented levels. hesitation Spectrum’s decision-makers? Data suggested covid surge over. ZERO pressure either way virus spreads perfectly fine incubation early symptomatic phase, Covid does. 

Seriously man hill die on. incorrect. pretty much us would get would months,

You assuming one done thing. Previous infection vaccination preclude getting infected after. Lots European borders shut first wave 2020, unless lockdowns place borders usually kept open since many people commute across borders much trade incredibly disruptive. That's assuming never becomes infectious measles. festive season generally agree, think make mistake ignore people react virus. virus extremely deadly, people care much hygiene distance, probably also easier willing get vaccinated virus ""just"" deadly e.g., alpha variant.   sure this, though?

If new variant transmissible, less deadly, that's bad thing. I’ve watching videos reading morning opposite I’ve seen/read. 

Of course don’t know exactly play out, there’s reason concern unfortunately.

I go back U.S. today. mask mandates. Vaccination rate crappy, case counts going back up. 

Sad say, feel safer Brasil. unique novel method exist tho? Cuz would crazy people use it. seems bit extreme... Um… already saying new variant…the vaccines effective maybe effective new variant  I’m get booster tomorrow. choose moderna Pfizer. first two moderna. know mix match gonna get moderna again. go Pfizer? advantage moderna now? Let’s honest variant bad sounds there’s going long lineup countries competing get ahold variant specific vaccines even it’ll probably going terms risk.

The best thing right get booster boost antibody response least reduce slightly importantly boost t-cell response far shown fooled variants.

Also one last thing haven’t seen cases doesn’t mean won’t get eventually saw Australia/NZ delta. evades vaccine, could also deadly still outcompete existing variants getting held back terms spread. arrogance man thinking nature control everyone actually done so, we'd different position. lmao, proven covid panic causes stock losses one day, recovered next week.

This journal article essentially interview people write articles layman oriented. 

This also oriented around layman's perspective. 

Key Points are...

**""And replication make mistake it’s caught error correction, resulting virus successful less successful?** 
There three possibilities—mutations nothing, impair virus, facilitate virus replication. virus transmits better, likely selected \[through evolution\] dominant. virus transmits rate, it’ll still transmit, it’s worse transmitting, it’ll get lost. 
We’ve seen pandemic mutations arisen became really widespread almost ones hear about, became clear least slightly better transmission. don’t think even dramatically better. slight advantage original virus.

**Better transmission doesn’t necessarily mean it’s virulent, right? It’s better replicating getting cells?**

 
Yes, means initial step getting cells better. development disease—the pathogenesis—has many things beside replication virus.""

As retired Communicable Disease Epidemiology program manager US State, involved Pandemic Planning since mid 2000's, read great deal viruses evolve. unbelievably complex, generalizations made. 

One pandemic organisms ""tend"" evolve around improved transmission.

This seeing Covid 19. expected. noted above, ""It slight advantage original virus.""

Key issues, new variant able evade human interventions designed impede transmission? 

This particularly important question. article goes issue essentially stating evolution viruses toward transmissibility function mutation rates number extant viruses environment essentially provides opportunities evolve. article states ""SARS-CoV-2 lower mutation rate viruses (HIV/Flu), unchecked spread led vast population viruses. learning virus particles carry mutations allow spread easily. Consequently, descendants variants, also carry beneficial mutations, rise."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Two virulence separate phenomena entirely, loosely related. first got discovered south africa mean evolved there... already susceptible infection even vaccinated. Death rate hospitalizations important factors Let's real, Omicron sounds much scarier ""nu""  Linkin Park Limp Bizkit variant also build B cells vaccine? likely less effective sure, like current vaccinarion status matter all. Hopefully, exploitable elemental weakness. personally 2 family members fully vaxxed symptomatic breakthrough infections (no booster; got mine thankfully. exposed last week tested negative multiple tests). One took 3 tests identify positive. Wondering it’s strain delta. Full statement uplifting. happen source pfizer thing? Prediction:

This going spread faster covid. also weaker humans.

Fear nothing. well... unless pfizer data changes significantly..  flaw. someone getting new information evaluating whether thoughts need change.  mean forcing people get vaccine lose job controlling isn’t it?  Federal law law. end day hospitals fined even provider number revoked violating Emergency Medical Treatment Labor Act  least Omega.... Yes makes sense. Sounds menacing happened Africa virus weakened vaccinated peopl Shit, one away Pi could've neat Sounds menacing Thank goodness. would difficult conversations talk ""new"" variant called ""nu"". expected, skipped Xi Hospitalization death honestly important factor. Well… no, people probably get anywhere cold flu symptoms, get better getting rest home. wasn’t case prior vaccines. rate cant even keep track Well… no, people probably get anywhere cold flu symptoms, get better getting rest home. wasn’t case prior vaccines. confirmed 99 percent likely. vaxxed, boosted, masked. Get healthier(eat right, exercise, workout, get sleep early) take care mental health includes reducing stress obsessing fear-click articles profit mental health. new variant make shit more? see anyone get arrested last time locked down? Nope nope. again. got vaccinated I’m done. still scared covid stay home. I’m things normal every normal person That's exactly lockdown though... voluntary, lockdown, forced government, point gun.

What happens abide lockdown?  I'm sure fine fourth booster shot hope point governments allow us get euthanized. really dont care stuff anymre. would annoy chinese. two years still bidet?  Twitter genuinely terrifying. article UK adding South Africa red list saw someone say need stop reporting case numbers, stop red lists ignore Covid got quite bit likes too. 

Why would treat infectious disease insecure guy waving us corner club? act like Covid sticking around spite us now. HK cases double vaccinated since May/June Pfizer trying gather information new variant, Bible much say, I'm disappointed get vaccine? nobody knows new features new release contain? Mickey mouse clubhouse king. Please no. need pandemic continue either, yet are.  Viruses evolve less deadly… mutating deadlier variants first kill bunch people burning out. Props addressing user readability without absolute troll it, Russianturk13 recognizing butthurt getting constructive crit! Need characteristics world. True  countries publishing favorable ivermectin RCTs high rates particular parasite kill you. Stay home fucking scared then!! Whst fuck thr point then? rest us want enjoy life. want avoid getting live longer zoom calls friends? fuck point that? want lock lock one stopping u Why? seen videos recently last videos saw back January February pro vaccines then. stance changed since? Dr. Topol impreased.

The Pfizer’ Paxlovid sound less scary (doesn’t wncourage virus mutation) preface rich countries could done much better job spreading round vaccines, case South Africa asking suppliers stop sending vaccines demand low. Transmissible vaccines risk allowing unpredictable future mutation (or set mutations) might turn dangerous. yet informed enough design transmissible version given virus highly infectious guaranteed never go dangerous random even several mutations. Due absence guarantee, stick injectable vaccines control cannot mutate. high prevalence contagious variant might cause trouble - instance, Delta share around ~100% sequenced genomes Brazil months, cases lowest levels since start pandemic.

That's Delta already burned first spike. like waves grow forever. Happy able share it. offers far grounded perspective alarmist media outlet posts last 24hrs.  Israel reported case too. interesting thought.

What principles mechanics one strain becoming dominant one squeezing predecessor Yes. supply chain. like everything else Capitalism. 

Did go see person get yours? Disrespecting nature well  Guess I'll start drinking death today. wait mutant COVID come claim me?  wear masks quarantine two weeks. Remember, two weeks slow curve! vaccines reformulated matter days. pills reduce symptoms factor ten. new variant cause alarm point? never better prepared combat disease history. Sorry I’m trying mean, figured important acknowledge there’s reason one talking yet Ya, virus naturally work. original COIVD 19 strain likely extinct reason Delta decimating brothers sisters. 

That said, variant could compete Delta spread nearly deadly. another variant comes, lets hope plays out. Otherwise worst ahead us still. COURSE GOT \[bleep\]ING BELGIUM. COUNTRY \[bleep\]ING NUMBN\[bleep\] WOULD \[bleep\] ENOUGH DUMB?! 

No, seriously. hate vast majority Belgians. hate. hate all. Especially politicians, might well called murderers point.

And there's lot there. Late last night UK, sky news reported 3 cases Botswana, 53 South Africa 1 Hong Kong. Today, flights suspended 6 countries Africa UK. anything, media reported numbers. I'm fully expecting restrictions come force UK sooner rather later point. booster Sunday morning, doubt I'll immune new varient, reported.   think US 5-11 year olds lowest group hospitalization death. 

But yeah, husband allowed allocated 4 doses, two would gone 3 year old could 1 dose each. happen won’t end see it. think end acceptance thing forever also people accepting understanding vaccine okay dangerous. took long time realize accept life gets much hopeful. Pandemic diseases fear turn gave crippling anxiety life. pandemic hit legit lost still keep working. I’m telling know feels hope happening thinking never end. protect point makes us comfortable. comfortable 3 shots, wear mask inside others around, sanitize needed, try take precautions keep safe. honestly started feeling way probably 6 months ago. don’t give up. world get you. may dodge initial antibodies T-cells still able recognize help launch new improved B-cells make better antibodies.   nothing else, speaks need far stricter policies allowing unvaccinated people travel

I wholeheartedly agree statement. We've soft unvaxxed travelling, NGO-HR groups well stated restrictive unvaxxed violates ""human rights"". ago create Twitter list epidemiologists like. That's usually listen info Covid Twitter. even ignore evidence, even assume lockdowns could somehow stop COVID...

That's logical assumption ignore can't hold someone hostage house gunpoint, absurdity.

Nobody ever Bullshit. South Africa sits pile vaccines using local scepticism.  Sounds right, Finland they've said unvaccinated 19 times higher chance ending hospital. 

But 80% population vaccinated, total numbers start get closer equal. would start Israel. one place nearly 100% vaccinations. goes show vaccine work! Huh? Assuming vaccine taken Thanks, makes sense well.  Man, really hope thing overhyped another delta. I’ll worry starts happen large scale. unless happens, im going anxious every day. answer pretty simple: Medical experts know they're talking about. Newspapers not.

Someone like Fauci probably presents information correctly, news sources paraphrase says may highlight one detail another order many reasons- know better, clickbait options, etc.

The easy answer people stupid qualified making statements public. always media hysteria surrounding Covid lol Mostly don’t learn answers questions first days know variant exists. Never trust Merck shit pulled Finasteride Shenanigans Don’t know Belgium compares, South Africa apparently among best screening delay even strain became dominant. Might needle haystack Belgium moment.  woman whose virus accumulated 32 mutations seven months reported June, AFAIK, virus unrelated B.1.1.529/Nu.

South Africa many economic problems. also center scientific expertise much sub-Saharan Africa, several plans set vaccine manufacture there. 

It regular commerce southern African nations (Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique) comparable HIV+ positive rates, poor ability monitor Covid cases, much less sequence identify new variants whole genome sequencing. Whereas South Africa sequencing per case country developing world.

Please take analogy racist anti-African, one year, apartment neighbor left pizza boxes coke cans littering floor, apartment near spotless. building serious cockroach problem, reported him, care. discovered reported landlord me, looking.

South Africa may may origin several variants, like Alpha, C.1.2, Nu originally detected there. detected South Africa means (whole genome sequencing) identify them. American we’re fucking stupid shouldn’t regardless vaccine status. Also don’t states agree adopting standards, one state could restrictions one everything right they’re right next other. Also American currently Europe, don’t jealous. wish US could impose nation wide restrictions.  Well even ignore evidence, even assume lockdowns could somehow stop COVID... would still totally immoral. can't hold someone hostage house gunpoint, absurdity. Lol. Yes. I'm scheduled 8pm today. Oh, rotten pie, way slice it.

After last two years we've experienced, I'd always prefer countries proactive reactive.

I'll often hear phrase ""we're going learn live COVID,"" agree...but reasons. Volatile markets far acceptable ill allowing new (and potentially extremely transmissible) variant run wild, unchecked. 

That said? also see mean.  didn’t even think that, good point. welcome death evolutionary pressure one way. pressure become less deadly, become deadly. balanced. new strains ""looked for""? Like, normal covid test also identify al strain, different test view microscope something? definitely sounds scary, important remember single data point cannot indicate trend. point -- enough info yet, good cautious. keep thinking this!  assuming you’re isn’t really possible places like Europe. Traveling across countries easy going across state boundaries. It’s hard police thing got one blame. earth would think twitter would place go actual helpful information. place one massive cesspit moment vaccines officially approved.  lol.. single data points side thoughts new variant:

* Vaccine still efficacy, especially terms case severity / fatality rate
* primary concern new mutations impact severity / fatality rate
* significant increase either, think society less marches on
* increase case severity and/or fatality rate, especially combined vaccine evasion, worst case scenario realized
* Society extremely fatigued COVID controls Guy Hong Kong booster? wasn’t confirmed hours ago. sec imagined Roid fuelled parasites even kind steroids. well ivermectin pretty good antiparasitic think take word trials malaria treatment. hopium tested years know bodies /s  could mutate something less deadly though. Third world country man, always like people toke roof train want step front, khow trains India... Seriously, current shit taking long. one, many. Keep mind yet much data, everybody, everywhere talking (mostly) behind :) goes burning out.

That's fine smaller infection pool.

The problem virus spread much that, variant popped able burn out, people would get infected different variant would fill gap.

You spread variant around world fast there's guarantee new variants go same.way.  would extremely unlucky everyone else there. SUPPLY short CURRENT WAGES SCHEDULES.

Hospitals across country currently trouble filling vacancies travel nurses offer double triple wages good benefits.

People like articles like willfully ignore well documented number nurses left profession past decade half they're subservient profit driven system.

Millions nurses would return workforce FUCKING PAID ENOUGH stressful job perform shit schedules work. mean, fuck know - literally section defending biological warfare medical studies. scare people man, play Nostradamus, thing ""big one"" expected happen preliminary theory variant “cooked” HIV patient…

Not sure could found though scientist tweeted said theory lowers credibility well. Great idea, think invented tomsething. Let's find name it.... mmmh vaccines ? sounds great Agreed. also think people confuse flu cold. people say flu big deal wonder really flu - knocked shit I'm young healthy. Belgium? that’s case big oof. encouraging terrifying Someday, may appreciate irony situation.

For now, I’m fourth hour trapped tarmac Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, officials allow much catering truck bring us water. appreciation irony elusive.

My flight took nearly 16 hours ago Johannesburg, people abuzz news discovery coronavirus variant spreading South Africa.

This variant many mutations, particular spike protein helps enter human cells, fears might able overcome immune response generated vaccination. variant spreading relatively quickly around Johannesburg.

South Africa’s National Institute Communicable Diseases shared knew midday Thursday, even took off, Britain banned flights southern Africa. Europe apparently panicked somewhere Sahara; time landed, told would permitted plane.

The irony lies fact South Africa report risk variants emerging countries low vaccination coverage — impressive, multilayered approach South Africa using try protect global public health. spent time labs scientists who, yesterday, made announcement left hostage planeload strangers “the authorities” somewhere debate us. capacity areas.

Eh really. ICUs north fine vaccination rate like 75%. mean, really want brought less resources us *but* option exists. … data point one place abnormally high vaccination rate data hospitalization death, primary focus mass vaccination campaigns. Okay, that’s great basis giving up. did, variant. hope that’s case. can’t deny things it’s better safe sorry. Better put restrictions place rather later. Like everything else covid, it’s buying time. heart goes medical community dealing almost two years now.  seen someone get face eaten Velociraptors

*so far* Nature unfortunately used :S like beginning.  Wealthy tourists spreading virus.  

Please halt international flights. Please? sentence make sense grammatically

if mean flu symptoms serious would ""mais PAS de maladie grave""

if flu symptoms serious would ""ET de maladie grave""

So idea mean maybe start giving vaccines? instead hoarding it? simply There's nothing wrong concerned, anyone claiming existential threat longer worth taking seriously. There's nearly enough data draw conclusions yet. fuck fucking shit jesus christ Viruses spread quicker people taking precautions. ya cuz learn ebola outbreaks... worth lot money, that's whatever wants. long go full henry ruggs NFL keep job. reporting 500% increase delta atm... already evidence quarantines specific country unfruitful.

The way completely monitored quarantine anyone enters country exceptions. never happen. may need booster tailored variant, research start immediately. probably sounds cold, need stop allowing non-vax clog system. care enough get shot, wanted live lives, mask play smart. minute get sick run ER call ambulance. people blame Vac mandates hospitals reason medical staff quit. non vaccine people causing pain. continue, like people told eat better smoke less, exercise...but end hospital. numbers ""Not shot"" kind people. frustrating seeing happen local area. WSB GME people going want piece action Cases US grossly underreported. Testing varies drastically state state, many people don’t feel need test symptoms, assuming it’s cold something else. Quick tests done home prohibitively expensive many people ($12 each), means going testing site, challenging people work day. personally feel testing consistently way keep spread low, think ease getting test paramount IS, especially since many resistant wearing masks getting vaccinated. Many fellow citizens want imagine Covid overblown. It’s unfortunate. waste time say lot word word trick Hopefully variant rub rest anti vaccinated. Anybody going wake US government officials get travel ban? following this? care?

Last checked, USA still universal healthcare. (They for-profit system stay sick and/or die can't afford medical treatment.) really think care people. Pfizer said could make new formula 100 days, could skip trials? flu vaccine update without trials? Can’t follow safety process totally different situation?   missed point comment replied entirely.

Viruses *don't* necessarily evolve less deadly. deadlier variants *don't* necessarily burn out.

When walk around two weeks infecting people even know sick, actually matter virus eventually kills not. selective pressure lethality all. Hate break Africa n=1? tells us really anything.  scenario described find ourselves, don’t see it’s treated like annual flu shot. Unfortunately, flu shot never anywhere close 100% uptake, even close. won’t ever rid it, best would likely able hope annual semi-annual variant booster. COVID IFR 20% contagious delta societies would collapse fast entire damn pandemic, whenever question ""is worth something even buys us time?"" answer always ""HELL YES, NEVER PASS OPPORTUNITY BUY DAMN TIME"".

I get frustrated ""well already spreading light fire let consume us"" comments. I'm gonna IGNORE advice furry crazy 4 cases Botswana

Lmao things work. never said less severe, said long incubation time compared Delta might stupidest damn question I’ve ever read  much three day turnaround least they'd die lot easier scenario. Getting everyone vaccinated would great thing. Mind blown Lol well sit back wait find out... learned nothing past two years, mean fuck. Stop reacting proactive. Stupidity part evolving species. It’ll sort way nature type thing. sexual side effects WAY overblown. Follow-up research showed rare reversible. 

People get hair loss around age start getting fat high blood pressure, inaccurate correlations initially spurned. 30 mutations first seen November, month are, complex understand new variant behavior days data. Gonna bet variant actually Europe reason behind current wave always daily video vaccine side effects That's true still explosion cases. South Africa reporting around 200 cases day new variant brought 2000 daily cases. I’m shook Society would crumble. Literally. Yeah problem started saying ressemble flu, since clot thingy problem (forgot name) affected lungs, people assumed damaged (of calling ""like flu"" done) Cough sources everything saying bullshit. need learn stuff. wanna see scary graph, know find it? know, Egypt 11 days prior showing symptoms lines *maybe* so. mean, could international line passport control getting Belgium know. long going live fear like this? old sick? long awaited follow song Miley Cyrus? agree vaccinated people still get spread it. goes back statement correct. Thanks Corona made quit Twitter. Way many people expected covid zero real thing. number virologists Twitter quite concerned variant. vaccinated might survive apocalypse round 6 unvaccinated much. Heartbreaking valuable worthy human beings world without access. access get booster comes community. go again! one pronounce Caren French? That's vaccination comes in. spread we'll dealing restrictions. high vaccination rate allows us let spread without causing health care system become overloaded. People really think don’t die it’s going fine good. Stories like others dealing long Covid exactly new strains cause alarm. ""just shut international travel"" without ever considering consequences

Well, everyone month everyone complying, yes. happen. Half assed implementations work. you’d still solid chunk population opposed every step way. Welcome... Metaverse. Remember covid overhyped, feels age ago now.

Here's hoping right! person consent laws mandates? Would punished? pandemic end everyone gets vaxed infected. Lol. Lmao. Oh yeah pills actually ""have"" yet, real world data yet regarding much impact need taken within 3-5 days symptom onset lot people even know sick covid? sound good remember spring vaccine supposed end covid. Go cobble together N95 underwear keep COVID Farts spreading ""Twitter experts"" like Feigl-Ding want, fine. One days, Ndnd…Bang! Zoom! Straight third moon Omicron Persei VIII! use infectious vaccines quite bit historically. Polio springs mind. also interesting gives good overview mention would extremely racist stop BIPOCs travelling.. right mind would even support that? Update:
My wife maxed antibody test u/ml). J&amp;J March full dose Moderna booster November. Omigod! Would mind posting source quoting? Omi-Rona dark horse I’m loop one different? can’t refuse US citizens entry country. could add mandatory quarantine. Wrong what? think fit variant, think discovered, going disappear countries restricting air travel weeks? Think minute.  hope restriction make sure returning US citizens lawful permanent residents carry virus. Best quarantine safe, block like Australia. US Citizens still gonna test get back regardless This. going give award you’re getting downvoted. Covid isn’t problem. It’s selfishness. boggle mind. looking multivalent vaccines many months, universally raise effectiveness across board existing unrelated variants. would guarantee would effective future variants, variants exist yet bothered.

By switching multivalent vaccines months ago could halved dose needed get effect, better future-proofing. downside except involved applying science reasoning. I'm really surprised all. Alabama ranked bottom states nation USA ranked around #30 world. state Alabama basically 3rd world country pocket money. course something. called mitigation. basing on? Agree. coverage variant absurd. Remember hyped mu variant vaccine evading variant disappeared. Hopefully source? Y’all exhausting, grow guess wrong. done chatting kind obviously support ""going living without fear"" may to. really bad? sore arm day. I’ll take Covid. omicron, nu? view surveillance way reactive possible 

By time discover highly contagious variant it’s already set waves many places 

Not saying that’s case contagious it’s late *laughs american* got kind lucky Delta transmissible less able escape antibodies variants. Omicron gathered lot mutations, increasing risk escape. Long distance relationships suck. tired videocalling! Remember vaccine immunity wanes vaccinated people protected disease death, getting infected.

More importantly, Omnicrom variant pops differently PCR tests would noticed. That’s thinking anyway.  scrolled read entire thread reassuring. Natural immunity last 5 years.Vaccine six months? “a study  US citizens allowed bring home variant? Yes, surely *this* time we'll learn lesson. Sigh. always hope guess. Everybody put fear panties start jacking off!!!! I’m feeling bit like iPhone now. I’ll get whatever upgrades need I’ll glad settles down. FFS, Delta, designated Omicron.  know. actually care took vacation. seemed like quite humble brag pretentious. 

""I've vacationing another country 2 weeks sooooo scared go back diseased home America"" live? US life mostly back normal cron-a also help neither Greek symbols would familiar people anglosphere. Oh, hard pronounce? worry, say like Ξ ξ, easy Vaccinated people catch transmit quite quickly shot

Well everyone told wait weeks let vaccine work start travelling. Vaccinated people lower chance ot getting covid lower chance transmitting it.

Get shit straight. study /= fact. doesn’t answer question. suggestions help stop pandemic? Wow that’s fast. fact woman infected Egypt

That’s fact. 11 days ago. One pros communism strict regimes general. Agreed. fair news nothing help Ya pronounce ks? think English speakers would confused ee Hey hot shot, guess US agreed accepting it’s normal get anxiety hearing news paired basic knowledge breakthroughs? It’s normal anxiety Nope. One big headaches talking COVID assumption every change virus inherently negative humans. Delta actually less dangerous terms vaccine escape Beta, spread means terrible consequences unprotected, still handled quite well vaccines terms serious side effects. Especially among boosted folks.

From evolutionary biology standpoint, ""perfectly fit"" virus would one monstrous R value little/no mortality hosts. Dead hosts = less chance spread. Probably unpopular opinion… but, new variant made headlines important USA holiday families together. coordinated attempt maintain Covid conversation topic, boost vaccines rates place. Also, stock market closed TH open half day Friday. Perfect timing large institutions play short game profit. 

The upcoming OIL crisis serious best way governments save face limit demand. inflation. Fear best medicine fight inflation point.

I’m pro science, booster all, but, timing seems fishy taste. Follow $ political interests. posted link one comments. idea less virulent previous lineages; nobody Johannesburg sick long enough yet need hospitalization.

This like previous lineages, even Delta completely missed chance slow halting flights. Cases Johannesburg increased something like 5x week, Delta numbers remaining flat time. either beyond credibility timeline lineage spreading worldwide half previous lineage (1-2 months). Buying extra time would tremendous value medium-case scenario.

Get next vaccine dose. many covid deniers here, doomed lol. Yeah would end times. No-ones risking 1 5 chance dying anything except get by. People suddenly stop loving loved ones pandemic go god-knows long. know reasons. Right, like traveling nations requires 3 shots. Except H strain, H strain ever identified individuals unusual immune systems allow fight HIV naturally, PreP effect either. need try delay it. I'm UK. worked hard keep cases high summer 😉 get Christmas! Can't spoil now. need understand happen vaccines. 50k cases Delta today. Boosters really reducing hospitalisations / deaths manage high case numbers. wrong people start infected we're us shit creek NHS already knees really got winter yet! Omicron. Guess wrong: It’s matter time Gavin newsom breaking news talking right back square one. See late January, Gavin Guess wrong: Well fucking dumb. now, give window people rush get here? think anything, likely already here. Anything paywalls boomer source. Overall structure no, it’s still spike protein, detailed level yes lot concerning ways. Lots mutations around receptor binding site. ( one set appears shifted whole loop anchors place make stronger contacts.) I’ll know simulation docking done Guess wrong: west snoozed hard Delta, embarrassing little done contain spread India UK US.

All experts talked little know best worry it. TWiV especially guilty creative word play keep calm pre-Delta Beta Alpha worse. Yeah think around 7% main area spread.... Literally sucks even doctors help spread panic posting information new variant leaving key information like cells still strong even current variants makes people like “oh, vaccines useless !!” repeating tons mutations number mutations doesn’t say it’s dangerous no, I’ve reply several comments people panicking claiming vaccines ineffective Instagram post well known doctor live posted panic inducing information. said something similar mom around February 2020 poo-poohed it. . . . lottery. straight offered 1000 bucks bet would seen least faster uptake. Guess wrong: I've personally known 3 people last weeks fully vaxxed who's popped positive. There's players/coaches sports testing positive. I'm getting nervous already here.  haha saw it! Good! That's good reminder get booster ASAP. 
I hope hospitals get overloaded again. UK acted contain Delta much slowly. trying better omnicrom.  I'd curious see would still elections wondering Maybe feel sick unhealthy havnt workout year? Go doctor step scale. gained lot weight since pandemic? guess yes announced flights SA 7 countries restricted starting Monday US oh fucks sake man keep together, there's zero evidence point strain dangerous vaccine resistant.  h transmit quite quickly shot, strain could worse sure vaccines based fir

the first cases vaccinated,should ban vaccinated people flying then? high number mutations spike protein, related vaccines stop spread. first vaccine-evading mutation. going like game ping-pong virus vaccine developers long time.  appreciate everything you’ve done people nation time. paid essentially lifeline frontline invisible war, Capitalism decided long ago screw lot us good neighbor envision better world. understand hear you, quite frankly wouldn’t blame leaving, there’s anything someone else nurse right now, let us know best you’ve us. know moves markets? Institutions hedge funds control trillions dollars. types organizations well connected surely hear whispers read cnbc headlines. markets well tuned. words: ""make vaccines infectious"". would dangerous long could mutate road. Also hardly possible today's understanding human physiology. challenging idea. ones unable vaccinated, booked yet, breakthrough infection told ""too bad, sad."" well? Given headline severity....all South Africa probably already dead winter get deadlier ever everything escalates speed, wake hours ago first hear new variant discovered South African scientists. hear spreading Israel Europe. variant really spreading around fast, holy shit. No, confirmed yet. Yeah showed up. Well, goes Christmas guys lol Hardly vaccinated get hospitalized. That's point it. said, unvaccinated made choice. Time tell hard society crack them. Oh know. likely contact trace back. Better US ""Hopes Prayers"" way things try get out. also larger normal population struggling AIDS. provides homes virus mutate freely without attacked think ever know origin. Botswana one first cases detected, considering already found lot cases South Africa probably spreading time now. honest matter origin. feel way. experts subject worried extent, usual suspects like Chise, Isaac Bogoch, Muge Cevik, etc etc. trying hardest explain people there's functionally zero chance variant fully evade vaccine-induced immunity. would take entirely new virus put us back square one/March 2020. Paywall I'm french think so, current wording technically valid one would actually write way. assume forgot ""pas"", rest paragraph sounds like  Known legions stoners ""the glass downstem made of"" go again. Nothing article contradicts said. better idea would inject enough virus immune system responds learns efficiently attack virus. want really tricky, inject mRNA teach body directly attack virus.

A live virus described could mutate become deadly. anyone tell variant less deadly? Cuz honestly celebrate high vaccination rates across Western world 2 years intermittent lockdowns such, tall order ask patience   Actually wrote sentence informing people variants mutation types long time everything stable focused real life
.
 yet today will:)

 friends know people works positions, share opinions studies. types people, found scientists shared lot similar things public too(check bloom lab).So trying inform people. looking writing, understand include self opinions, mostly includes scientific informations check small search.

For worst stuff, say ""doomsday"" stuff, actually made reference like know, media saying like fully immune escape variant come mostly used ""doomsday variant"" always said new variant first lambda mu b.1640 etc. wanted emphasize look game changer variant among those, probably variant deserves title spike profile potential. claim like burn world, died lol tweak vaccines easily. 

If say worst combo stuff wrote reason guess read it. K417 major escape region class 1 E484 class 2 G446 second class 3(first one K444) however G446 escape ability K444. said worst combo,that mean vaccines work worst combination see virus,I claim vaccines salt water lol. Vaccines probably take biggest hit variant far make useless that's said ""may"" update maybe combinations work together well like Kappa can't see huge dramatic reduction( wrote too) limited lab informations move theorical like scientists governments.  MSM trying keep workers place back - there's way hell they'll send message supports unemployment &amp; lockdowns/quarantines now.

We're fucked.  need spend less time internet guy. wish news stories would address two key items:

* vaccination status people infected
* impact health

I would imagine people traveling internationally vaccinated, knowing sure would helpful.

I've also yet seen information impact people's health. seems like new variant found places fairly robust testing processes, I'm wondering new variant causes noticeable change vaccinated immune system deals infection. Maybe easier catch, less likely cause severe outcome? Hard say point, news stories I've seen seem focus transmission rate. 770,000+ bodies already pretty damn big pile. Ya hospital full since August deaths rivaling last January already. signs bad people even notice. wild.  That’s myth. 

When COVID patients fill hospitals even people unrelated diseases like cancer, cardio whatever can’t get treated. point doesn’t matter you’re vac not. Indoor masks don’t anything isn’t sufficient airflow means it’s almost certain US too. That's really clunky sentence, speak French fluently poorly worded sentence compute well even me.

But part **n’était pas vaccinée**, ni **n’avait été infectée** par le passé.

So translation: **unvaccinated**, **no** prior natural infection \[or immunity\]. prime candidate develop severe illness, alone speak variant dangerous. yeah Even bodies pile Americans shout ""God chosen live immune system protect me. legislate body vaccines mask mandates! also, need make sure women cannot get abortions cuz fuck rights.""

Hope we're still dealing new variants whenTrunp comes back 2024. link gave you. is, call them

*Vaccines*. hard concept. cause identified variant bearing origination fact thats already around world. 

Please remind point vaccinated again? Seems there’s second article claiming mild symptoms. you’re right honestly doesn’t matter either way, symptoms wouldn’t really tell us anything grand scheme variant. We’ll wait see gather data variant coming weeks point hopefully countries realize completely stopping societies every months viable strategy leads ruin medium/long term (even discounting reduced quality lift/mental health, many fewer babies born/fewer couple meeting etc. result this?), solution shield vulnerable old people let rest live lives minimum restrictions. I’m guessing seeing northern states. delta peak September wasn’t bad. spiking like crazy even vaccinated people know getting sick (including myself). new variant, way delta strain summer getting us virus want continue kill host

The virus ""want"" anything. virus kills host soon prevents virus spreading selective pressure virus become deadly.

This seem case covid. People eventually die covid spread much survive it. I’m guessing seeing northern states. delta peak September wasn’t bad. spiking like crazy even vaccinated people know getting sick (including myself). new variant, way delta strain summer getting us like seeing cockroaches different parts apartment realizing they're probably everywhere already story be, ""nurses receiving less help support top historically poor help support amid worst pandemic last century"" ""nothing new here, move along"" may be... make sense rush conclusions. make sense prepare worst. Ah toddler parent prepared absolute insanity! may even come Delta 

Transmissibility cannot directly measured, *inferred* data, imprecise measurements (like cases). infection levels low overall South Africa, plausible explanations - say couple superspreader events resulting infection chains - variant raced ahead prevalence, don’t necessarily mean transmissible outcompete Delta areas higher infection levels 

Now it’s monitored, part PCR testing sequencing, we’ll know weeks transmissibility advantage I'm looking forward towards end pandemic 5 500 years Bro... even none us took vaccine threw masks away got together one long worldwide human centipede line virus would cause ""the extinction human species"". true airborne nature virus really concerning addition potential evasive properties.  Rough couple months ahead. question responded whether people recover long Covid. 

This article address question, states people don’t get long Covid first place. find encouraging governments taking seriously acting quickly. much better response saw 2020. could worse. could era lacked scientific advancements today. Imagine Black Plague eras. stop dreading wear mask, get vaccinated, live life best can.

You borrowed time. Reddit access technology science fiction decades ago. Always look bright side. end world, made far worse diseases still kicking.  news deadlier mutation nothing slow holiday travel. still see packed airports people “just trust immune systems job”. single thread evidence current vaccines work? sensationalism headline-grabbing? markets free fall implications trillions. ""Simply put, Gaia hypothesis says Earth living system uses similar mechanisms living creatures use stay alive, constantly regulating temperature, chemical physical inputs outputs adaptation evolution"" Inject hopium right vein please unvaccinated though; comparison necessarily useful draw conclusions from. would bad time *any* variant virus, including original strain protection all. gonna need LOT toiletpaper. 11 days? fuck thing? settle friend. WAY early make predictions like that.  like answers questions no.

That kind mentality we're back square 1.

China one countries got things right extreme early reaction.  describing pretty much vaccine.  that’s case U.S. already. less viral genetic sequencing countries bet like “it’s finally here!” It’ll already spreading like wildfire lot longer knew about. saw guy say originated Botswana, source origin currently?   would make sense. lot northern states, seemed already delta “spike” months ago September. However, spiking like crazy again. I’m guessing it’s new variant lot vaccinated people know getting sick Definitely US.


My entire family vaccinated get together thanksgiving (albeit distanced usual yada yada).


US fukt. patient question young **unvaccinated** woman

Well that's going favours... guess good news dude Hong Kong violated quarantine vaccinated asymptomatic. basically restart know. already late. Meanwhile local politician said new strain democrat idea ruin holidays Christmas. Mf thinks democrats influence whole world ruin particular country. It’s shameful living USA lately :( Leaders overreact start ease back method.



Right?




Right?



Are adults left? Lol happened times already…. Didnt change much. virus 'think'. suggesting choosing that's natural selection works. mutation survives host lives long enough pass virus, that's it. matter host dies not, long virus able successful spread happens... case Covid, host contagious quite awhile becoming fatal.  long remains case, variant reproduces fastest spread host 'win', regardless lethality.   good news industrial capacity fight new variant people don’t taught something new.  need public patient battle continues fought. suspect right we'll see new variant infections appear countries soon. South Africa travel hub like Dubai, NY, London etc there's good reason SA scientists discover new variants first second one found. Pandemic pressed reset button. Prepare SARS-CoV3 /CoViD21 guys think point put hope new drugs treatment development stop nightmare, vaccines? know think anymore, thought makes easier me. Meanwhile...

[A heavily-mutated Covid variant emerges southern Africa: Here's know working doctor, fundamental principles medicine public health change rapidly relax, like riding bicycle. really mind called such. know Films start, could genetically engineer virus complete Coronavirus deliver symptoms? even possible?  spike South Africa may least partically caused one unlucky superspreader events.

Context also important here. Everyone definitely read Chise's thread Twitter morning, informative claim backed expert views actual data. spread much SA *there variant present,* least meaningful numbers. Nu outcompete anything, popped relative void variants. 

And fact reported countries speaks spread started longer week ago. hard draw conclusions yet, likely indicates ""500% contagious Delta"", percentage drawn incorrect data thrown away now. Chise said, anyone believing particular figure getting punked. 

Let's also overlook SA's 24% vaccination rate, woefully insufficient stamp uncontrolled spread. evidence highly vaccinated countries, countries Delta *actually is* dominant strain. Let's take one step time, data thrown around last 24 hours speculation best, fear mongering worst. spread scary keep holding fact Hong Kong cases vaccinated booster asymptomatic. Fingers crossed means won’t completely evade vaccines. Winter's coming, expect another shitshow. countries direct flights South Africa needs act. think that's lot. sure happens connecting flights like Emirates. That’s good right? hard, world lockdown needed. leaving anything bare essentials. comply, get go jail.

Freedoms legalities damned, needed. would rather uphold principles ever government overtstep bounds betterment humanity.

History look back kindly collective selfishness certain people political parties. Anyone else read world war z?  worked lot places also put place quarantine requirements border. Even Australia federal government refused anything covid 2 years wanted copy usual conservative playbook, states able shut borders least make people quarantine leaky hotels put place enough measures pretty much keep covid Australia pandemic. conservative state trying anything unfortunately led big outbreak impacted two densely populated states last months, rest country still covid free nearly fully vaccinated maybe past pandemic almost issues, unless variant emerges moves finish line. Gotta collect all!  Rumour control, safe folks. Maybe Dwight right. Owning hazmat suit economical Lol… ends bored idiots can’t think two weeks future incubate especially deadly covid strain long incubation periods massive die off. speak yourself, speak me, ""normal people."" confident, invite go volunteer hospital--they could use help. Oh, want that, right? want drink beer restaurant, that's concerned about. doses exceptionally quickly, getting large amounts going take time: gotta grow template plasmids, take time, take time creating mRNA sequences templates also takes time, fit finish (that part quick). [Another optimistic take  Puzzle here.

However Pfizer drug 89% effective preventing hospitalizations vs 30% Merck Pfizer seems lot better. years we'll getting annual quadrivalent strain covid vaccine go along flu vaccine.

I assure happen. mutation rate Influenza viruses high compared Coronaviruses favoured antigenic shift, segmented RNA, -ssRNA, two proteine Hemagglutinin Neuraminidase large number variants short genome. 

The Coronaviruses genome that's 30kbp long, +ssRNA genome dependent Proteine bind ACE 2 receptors, dependent either TMPSSR2 Furin. also huge advantage Influenza viruses RNA-dependent-Polymerase proof reading function, means correct mutations multiplying RNA. course proof reading function perfect lowers mutation rate minimum.

So no, Coronavirus likely stay become yearly strain like Influenza does. fought pushed back.  soon tell. least, protection infection probably gonna drop Places like Australia New Zealand closed borders non-essential travel places actually good economic performance last 2 years. Places like UK tried ignore Covid got set back 8-10 years economic growth. Yes. took chances drugs know kill them. Let's stop trying make bleeding heart thing. people made choice's, yet bad stuff happens clogged system others critical care need danger. kid cancer, elderly woman dementia never drug, smoked drank life (my mother) needed critical care wait hours due hospital full non vaccine people. Many affected suffering choices others made. Maybe. one would hope . virologists Twitter follow get better grasp situation. Actually already dubbed „Nu“ guess „Nu“ variant obvious pun. Literally every person know covid dosnt care anymore. already job I’ll pass volunteering already need negative test fly back US. way awhile now. UK requiring travellers South Africa quarantine two weeks hotel **starting Sunday**. 

This allow travellers feel like two weeks hotel quarantine, pay early flight Sunday, bring covid variants them. ""WHO decided call Omicron.""


""I know.""


""THIRD BASE!"" guess depends country. know U.S. CDC relaxed mask mandates vaccinated people since spring Netherlands virtually nobody wearing mask anywhere ever advice might receive forum is, fact offered, relied on. advise always mistake ask world large, people anonymous necessarily interests heart, personal health decisions. COVID caused visual disfigurement like small pox, without changing current death rate, everyone would moved stop it. 

Because Covid invisible people die alone hospital, it’s easier skeptics ignore. follow virologists Twitter invite too, better understanding situation. matters since it’s already here. private flights take country demand land country want land in. it’s extremely difficult deny since, well it’ll crash land somewhere.

Men Omicron Persei 7 


Women Omicron Persei 9 right N?  bet fine people Pfizer rubbing hands laughing right  far accurate sense, since difference 95% 99% incredibly high. I’m worried government Tin foil hat conspiracy. 

My concern force people get vaccinated? antibodies don’t need vaccine. fatality unvaccinated COVID anyways days haven’t kept up? risk want vaccine vaccinated. so, afraid people choose be? weren’t afraid injected mRNA afraid potential COVID exposure you’re ok? seriousness it’ll probably shortened blows up. “Omicron” total mouthful. BINGO!!!  silver lining JNJ vaccine recipients clearest data effectiveness omicron since JJ used heavily south africa one worst comparisons I've ever heard. point gonna drop vaccine water supply. tl;dr: B.1.1.529, variant first identified southern Africa. Despite rumors would called ""nu"" variant, World Health Organization naming ""Omicron."" (My guess avoid confusion English word ""new."") Subvariants identified Botswana indicate transmissibility par Delta. Vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines, offer protection virus, breakthroughs already identified.

In short, get vaccinated, get boosted, hunker down. could get rough. thought due one variants MI. too. Im fucking early 20's. Life supposed better this. know im bratty people way worse, im done stupid fucking virus. mental health going drain BBC days. Lrrr you?  blame anti-vaxxers.

At point society need adjust reasonable risks involved open free society, go live live. ALWAYS ""new"" risk. Can't live fear entire life.

I say pro-vaxxer 3 shots would take 4th shot help future issues.  Patient zero untreated HIV/AIDS man carried covid prolonged period time. I’m hyper pro vaccine would likely done nothing instance. No. Life black white. Life black white. Life black white.

First, vaccine effective designed work on. something new, need learn determine best approach it.

Additionally, always learn things. mean wait indefinitely make decisions, especially issues life death. Oh, either community Egypt, highly population-dense area tens millions people significant connectivity global regions, Belgium-Netherlands-western Germany corridor, highly dense area tens millions people enormous connectivity global regions.

Cool. Probably never. Anything descendant original SARS-Cov-2 probably considered variant.

SARS-Cov-3, ever exist, next crossover event entirely new virus animals humans, ancestral link SARS-Cov-2. Ban popplers. I’m sorry hear that. Sending positive energy southern US  Vaccinated people catch transmit same, well protected effects disease less infection subsequent transmission.

In Europe current wave comprised roughly proportion vaccinated people general population (I talking cases, ICU admissions obviously might mistaken).

And let's honest, fully vaccinated many people took less precautions, human. Damn it, Lrrr. would arrived within last week, sampled roughly now, we'd sequencing results 1-2 weeks. Unlike countries infrastructure quickly.

How many daily travelers Johannesburg US? Thanks much, appreciate link. variant, would international travel.

Right now, enough data say worse variant. Well lost credibility first, can’t make vaccine get hands new virus variant. 
second, even develop weeks now, may months testing Omicron sounds formidable fuck. Like evil villain stroking cat planning mass industrial bomb assembly underground lab. Exactly! Visibility low bc people covid struggling privacy homes and/or dying privacy hospital room. one believes covid severe bc expect people streets falling dead dramatic fashion. 

Your story neighbors similar live. even neighbor die covid people still say “I don’t know anyone who’s died!” Simply bc weren’t acquainted neighbor. idea Merk Pfizer drugs effective this? Probably early hopefully tested. Start making commune plans now, everyone  thing overdone squeakquels suck.

FIFY skip Xi? Slovenia (then part Yugoslavia), around 1.5 mln 86% total population vaccinated within 10 days. government extremely effective regard. booster restored immunity 95% plus even delta variant Israel. beat way slow spread. [This web page explains (this people made it) absolutely everyone else well - already, certainly everywhere. Great, we've got fucking Transformer COVID variant. *looks Michigan* Israel high vaccination rates. got ahead early numbers looked better while, significant antivaxx population lot children. wouldve fucking hilarious tbh  ain't looking wrong right now.

I'm 3 shots in, could care less variants.

Go ahead volunteer family first then.  Brb buying Pfizer stock, made bank last/current panic. 2 letters Nu, wonder VOCs press never picked on. [As Treebeard always Vascular disease term looking Covid never going away - ever. It’ll like flu, always here, always mutating. Always needing new shots keep up.

Except way deadly.  

Maybe problem correct eventually. scared stay home. aren’t continue life. Agree. Please don’t delete! Viruses mutate spread. vaccinated makes less likely spread virus. larger population vaccinated boosted citizenry, less likelihood spread therefore less likelihood new variants. Anyone even tiny bit knowledge viruses mutate knows that. 

There's also added factor vaccinated, body launches quick efficient campaign eradicate virus. means shorter illness less likelihood virus time mutate. Again, anyone even tiny bit knowledge viruses mutate knows that. 

A vaccinated population way forward. Get vaccine. Omicron Persei 8 I'm devastated. know recover. Well case.  can't. bad, ""stench corpses hangs deserted town"" bad. prove much. increased infectiousness 2 orders magnitude decreased transmissibility 1 order magnitude. set rule says virus mutate way. Let's suppose became 2x infectious 10x less deadly. would half death count then. point clue enough data see new strain actually does. mass events like hospitalizations even though detected almost three weeks ago country extremely low vaccination rates. two men Hong Kong asymptomatic unvaccinated woman Belgium mild symptoms. Thinking back Delta India, rapidly illness death swept parts country…this thing. know it’s early game right indication we’re dealing omega strain that’s going wipe humanity.

Some companies tried variant-specific vaccines, better original ones.  two options. plenty diseases around thousands years killed everyone also quite bad news get them. Take dengue fever one example among hundreds. That's probably COVID heading. Short answer: yes. Judging way people end using ""Delta"", name way confusing want WWIII accidentally started covid wave gets misinterpreted military attack. mention fact keeps mutating. Even vaccines curb symptoms, don’t take appropriate action stop spread, it’ll keep forming new variants. Different strains spread faster rates varying degrees impact humans. Especially spike protein mutations. It’s smart choice IMO. never really locked America - worked home service class brought us things.

A true lockdown would amazing would needed couple weeks, alas “patriotic” counterparts would rather 1300 Americans die per day inconvenienced. I’m starting new job ER (in Michigan) weeks. feel like like going war zone. DAMN EVOLUTION! turning point. sad realization may facing yet another wave like Delta Alpha (Assumption slightly worse Delta smaller naive population). story arc still going on, devs pls Wonder world would look like without humans... abandoned buildings part nature  Ah yeah appreciate that, going context eloba opinion around that. hoping :( true fully vaccinated boosted, concern? regions world sequencing monitoring. many pathogens.

Then, discover leak say “oh god, boat leak need fix sinks!”

It found leak immediately- fine, didn’t, so… Yeah keep seeing others say wrong. English used common differentiation colds flus, referred Grip. still way German romance languages vaccines still let virus mutate inside host? immune system beat that? god help us Honestly, feel lot people overreacting variant, medical community stock market. classified “variant concern” one day discovered, believe took week two classify delta that. now, despite mutations, early evidence seems show variant anymore deadly delta, possibly even less deadly. look facts right facts. 64 triple vaxed likely travel Christmas depending restrictions look like area go too. many unpredictable factors come play well.
Also look cost cancelling - worth losing money put it?

Masks always mandated everywhere outside home. Social distancing announcements posters incessant. organisational culture somewhat opposite US, many organisations, order avoid cases costs, implemented really over-the-top Covid measures cause way harm good.

I’m tired told there’s reason keep going. isn’t. amount “positive thinking” “coping mechanisms” especially fucking bullshit therapy going change world completely gone shit generation never even got chance. 

Vent over. agree vaccinated people still get spread it.
Has anyone ever said otherwise? said beginning vaccine prevent getting it, prevents ending ICU? 


Your statement nonsense missing main point 60% weaker virus survive much outside body host. 

The problem course unvaccinated people arrogance stupidity keep spreading getting people sick, 95% people ICU ones vaccinated. willingly go 14 days quarantine, really get argued. mean misinterpret reporter saying  Passengers reading aloud news stories say Europe intends put us mandatory 14-day quarantine, regardless vaccination status test results.  

sounds like finds idea ludicrous. One last things class trained identifying potential pandemic/epidemic outbreaks novel biological warfare agents.

So yes, I'm serious. thought moved cases mattering deaths/severe symptoms? literally unvaccinated. me, someone vaccinated, really care?  think it’s going long winter everyone. It’s matter time pops North America. Time tell infectious delta. Psh got old covid? Get times old man, cool kids getting Nu Covid. It’s rage I've fake virus.

Another variant outbreak governments slow respond (at least US). implying west care Africa? /s Exactly. bunch different rhinoviruses adenoviruses enteroviruses coronaviruses you’re looking 200 different viruses known causing colds. 

Have fun vaccinating that. Haha. point new variant becomes new strain? Found AfD (far right COVID climate-change denier party) supporter. Also finding South Africa 23 percent vaccination rate? recent headlines would think fully vaccinated country something new variant ripping them. practically certain get designation eventually. Please keep mind South Africa 24% total population fully vaccinated well. Easy panic lets see happens. double vaccinated. quarantine hotel HK, across hall other. initial case apparently thought it’d fine open door room wearing valve mask🤦🏼‍♀️ keep seeing people make something less severe?

Where getting assumption?

I’m hearing enough it’s beginning sound like misinformation campaign. hate fact author preface thoughts ""this preliminary, know, things could easily change""....because ***didn't*** say that, people would wield findings him. kids (5 7) getting first shots hour. Got booster 3 weeks ago. 

2022 going back normal. Disney table. mental health priority. I'm surprised seen antivaxxers raids covid wards yet honest. Hopefully existing vaccines offer least *some* protection. Otherwise going bad, bad time coming. I've worked infectious disease bit. guess pool large amount resources slowly fades terms lethality coverage modern medicine takes over.

Working HIV Hep C care shocking quickly went either horrible treatment death sentence manageable daily meds completely treatable surprising ease due timeline treatment change.


Tldr: better part fighting viruses cancer. reasons flu hard eradicate covid really share properties.

My guess, still guess backed moderate amount relatable knowledge overcome covid modern medicine. timeline guess, hardest part may getting people take medicine. best case less deadly. know widespread Europe easy detect PCR tests  one kicks Omega's one-winged angel! rule banning misinformation.  Viruses evolve less deadly. Full stop. Definitely regretting 3 week trip Berlin I’d booked recently. I’m worried I’ll get sick—I’m boostered; it’s getting better—but threat restrictions/ lockdown I’m there. Especially airlines back forgiving rescheduling due Covid. Alas! contemporary life. Next time book Mexico instead. know around 2003 America murdered 1,000,000 civilians Iraq, right?

I've around since 60s, always multiple things, cone, time. always bad, worse. know, right!? Heck. done goofed. Thank you. trouble getting archive phone last iOS update.  still early process, hearing confirmed cases mild illness quick deaths definitely good. everyone flight show proof negative Covid test; most, seems, fully vaccinated, am.

If variant dodges vaccine immunity, hell think matters?


For God's sakes, punished advancing research, quarantined, safety precaution, potential public health threat, neither enough knowledge means solving get hand.

For fuck sake, people got high horses, stopped treating safety measures like persecution, maybe 2 years fucking plague.  need lockdown US NOW.  correct im wrong company adapted products delta? none? AZ sure. Pfizer booster repeating first dose right? etc read triage refuse provide care vaccinated Why? Sounds like you’re good position  need go back lockdown, many lives lost, something play politics ah shit, go again. 


*starts buying flower toilet paper* mostly kidding make good billionaire, supposed fear loathe engineer sitting behind who's worth $90 thousand year, scrub.  wonder happen people planes waiting tarmac? Send back South Africa? No! freedom! /s Two weeks slow spread HIV fatal anymore rich countries. Also ""special trait"" HIV working cure vaccine. similar rabies. super deadly, rabies-free countries. super deadly vaccine. HIV similar fate (some day).

We living society advanced medicine. Death rates matters. throwing money resources eliminate running noses. fight deadly stuffs. Like cancer HIV. I’m saying small amounts transmissibility improvements need vastly outmatch delta overcome combination conferred natural immunity delta left us with.

A small adjustment r value cause tail end pandemic drop less precipitously, continue ravage first world nations much much better.

The analogy I’ve using chances we’ll another quarterback good Peyton manning next 20 years? That’s delta. order additional mutation impactful Tom Brady.

The calculus changed vaccination Covid variant wide exposure also holiday season exposed corners edges. combination conferred natural immunity make whatever mutates climb much steeper hill.

There Covid variants haven’t impact delta nearly worst nightmare scenario.

I’m going go right say it. positive confirmation new strain orders magnitude bigger disaster hype nothing more. disaster already happened. John cusack drove house limousine doors torn back late august people predicting ele asteroid way. Possible, unlikely.  known side effect? already know answer. Yeah. dug find actual numbers. yesterday, found 60 individuals. sample size cannot extrapolated anything. mutations concerning, need time watch spread severity real time. That's way feel. already still pretty safe felt like seeing brighter days around corner. Really looking forward spring. knows. Masks never bothered me, vaccines bother me, bummed getting see people much. Hopefully people close cautious much relaxing get together people know safe. Less likelihood break infection. ones Hong Kong similar longish incubation periods. Also arrived date. almost wonder airport time. nations accept COVID fact life spend resources energy protecting highest risk go seen ""reckless"" panicking case counts seen forward thinking

How say hospitals overflowing again? We're going living COVID long time.

It honestly sounds like upset lockdowns.   Nah, triage. treat resources run out, unsaveable, ones likely live? yes lower rate since vaccine helps fight virus vaccines significantly reduce chance mutation.

world never works binary. hurry get Mars That’s true, you’re less likely spread it, 40% less likely according Another problem fact still stupidly old beliefs Africa witchcraft real. Whoa whoa whoa gonna need source that, chief. Kay like, would give reason believe since 2020? 

It's bad. Basically every hopeful event dashed next looming spectre, appropriately so. Delta fucked vaccines made life harder unvaccinated. Covid turned pretty bad held breath. 

I'm taking optimist's route here. writing wall similar every horrible Covid event. Media desperate variant makes vaccines useless. Well yes no. Even North lots ICU beds disabled, missing staff.  difference is, compared 2020 technology, manufacturing, distribution channels &amp; logistics, sign-up websites, public health dashboards &amp; media advisory channels, pop-up clinics, vaccine IDs (albeit shitty paper ones U.S.), infrastructure training point delivery rapidly getting shots arms.
None existed time last year.

Guaranteed it’s everywhere already, news coming thick fast But…but…mah freedoms 😫😫😫 Thank god got booster damn near day 6 months past second dose, aren’t appointments days weeks get booster, able luckily get one easily booked mine 2 weeks ago

Feel like individual best defenses getting vaccinated, damn concerning spent whole career working towards designing one things, set essentially next revolution branch medicine secure financial professional future, would keen people saging ""just give ot away!""?

Yeah, reporter clearly ""not me, I'm special!"" bias going on. people absolutely quarantined couple weeks enough data confident meaningful risk release them.  Terrifying true.

Although new variant could change that. fucking care anymore. hospitals safe. happened yet.

The rattlesnake vaccine would mandatory immediately That's got vaccinated. However question much protection really getting future boosters? That's I'm seeing risk reward. risk already small reward vaccinated great. making scientific claims that's initial thoughts they're already talking next booster first even fully rolled out. new Omicron variant vaccine-resistant, requirement negative PCR test might actually needed. I'm others here, seems bit steep price pay considering cheaper alternatives. around 700$ estimated per patient?

I guess still considered since might worth invest logistics shipping preserving MRNA vaccines. bet much though. Yep. totally different answer someone vaccinated without booster January 2021 vs someone recently fully vaccinated recieved booster likely already everywhere, goal point slow give time figure we're dealing with. Can't keep ever coming long international travel lack complete quarantine. mean? Simultaneously vaccinating everyone globe?

To honest, see something reasonable people disagree ... hope ends nothing, correct, would better us :) Au contraire... new variant means even positives... statistically that’s necessarily true, depends numbers.

However, exact thing accused of. less citations.

I may wrong, I’ll admit. But, cited got it. said something like gospel.  keep copying pasting even though mutations mean vaccine efficacy severe illness diminished, head South African Medical Association number high-profile epidemiologists stated repeatedly there's evidence lower vaccine efficacy. could potentially linked Xi Jinping?

Anything virulence? need. look ratio deaths/(estimated) infected cases ca. july countries Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Canada, Italy etc. countries high vaccine rates IFR tend slightly 0.1%. actually little lower IFR flu. 

There's also fairly simple estimation confirms this. Vaccines give offer ca. 90% protection (on average) death serious illness. means IFR vaccinated individuals 10% unvaccinated individuals. 70-80% population vaccinated, vaccinated population skews towards older population, expect see decline IFR 0.5-1% unvaccinated population ca. 0.1% (mostly) vaccinated population. get you, bro banking Epsilon arguing straw man. ok turn while. Take care mental health. Israel always ""oh turntables"" everyone. least modern Israel. *scribbles notes*  need shift burden risk assessment individual level point.

this doesnt work. netherlands spent almost two years running covid strategy based suggestions rules, personal responsibility all. healthcare system brink collapse. data case numbers Johannesburg last 7-14 days, showing Omicron increasing case counts 3-5x per week Delta remains constant. Using 5-day serial interval 3x outperforming per week gives 2-fold transmission advantage. course know transmission advantage due increased virus efficiency, immune evasion. former Delta's 20-25% secondary attack rate would around 50% - halfway Delta Measles.

The issue numbers small there's 1-2 weeks them, sequencing can't even really done time. would accurate say high uncertainty, even including possibility Delta spreading Omicron. incredibly unclear Delta cases flat going last 2-week period - South Africa never big Delta wave, 5% country test positive 28% get first doses, although beginning summer. markets drop.   No, wtf, everyone country virus still there. simple that... Covid 4: Forward Unto Dawn Happy Omicron Year guys? extremely positive development extremely depressing  doesn’t need sequenced: Much like Alpha causes S-gene dropout, long we’re still testing, we’re essentially sequencing it. clusters we’re seeing dropout, we’ll know spread. production capacity already higher administration capacity world. think give boosters vaccinate rest world.

Every world leader handful: ""I disagree power prove it."" still evidence might outcompete it. delta wasnt spreading omicron is, competing delta. likely matter. Post booster immunity increases many fold current variants (upwards 10 40 fold). updated booster (even -necessary-) available 3,4,5 months. great shape gotten 3rd shot months.....it's seeming like T/B-cells mature time, rechallenge w/ C19 (via another shot) creates better response even original 2 course shots. (Good science discussions latest papers group /r/covid19)  Nah, it’s shown cause Erectile Disfunction men still ok getting sick dick floppy covid cock. 

I right push rope rest life. That’s freedom boys. thing makes sense  makes feel better. Thank chief Tedros Ghebreyeseus Greek **/s** dunno, plenty viruses years + long incubation times. 100% believe governments data variant haven’t seen. It’s common sense officials get news first. 

At first sounded like variants, frantic response hint least bad delta. I'm refuting that, I'm saying would dominate news months weeks especially considering contagious new variant, another surge even worse previous one definitely happen. understand one get I'm saying. Well guess pharmacy screwing giving full dose might pay :P. unvaccinated people allowed travel? opinions vaccines you’re vaccinated, international travel you. It’s simple.  Seconding book recommendation. It’s really good. Idiot? cunt honestly.  wonder Provence different. sure friend can’t get tested week? seems odd me. variant detected countries ban, apply US citizens, go effect Monday... largely symbolic make administration look proactive. wonder Provence different. sure friend can’t get tested week? seems odd me. Oh yeah get completely. 
I’m saying small view, things rosy. 
I wanted believe America would wrap continual ramp countries would jump bandwagon. 
It felt like finally gotten weapon beat virus (even stalemate sorts) back bring back level normality. 
Well, omicron seems like maybe things going take turn worst… 
As say, need get world vaccinated, may simply turn completely impossible. TL;DR: We're probably fucked. Sadly, it’s nearly everyone earth known someone died COVID-19. we’re similar trajectory Spanish flu around century ago, still like 7 months shit, maybe mutates something sinister. Thanks that, needed. noticed thing local drug store. way down, today everyone saw masks Texas middle day remote people retirees probably drug store. obviously n=1 sampling. Nah it’s actually much worse sounds. Western healthcare brink might takes years get poor quality had. don’t understand important quality nursing healthcare staff aren’t burned out, good luck. new flu recent estimate incubation period medium 8 days, 10% people 14 days. Delta thought shorter, new variant descendant Delta. economist great means production. bit iffy work, bit stock portfolio. Thing's dangerous us original virus two weeks incubation. Yup us late party, name already attached time started reading comments Nu. Omicron found. turns dangerous variant name quite prophetic. Compare Portugal Bulgaria see work, well enough. compare low vaxed country countries high rates triple vaxed people like UAE Israel. Gottlieb went CNBC, guess say all. two big points, mentioned fashion morning:

. Yes, TECHNICALLY true variant preformed Delta. context extremely important. Within South Africa, Delta essentially run course. easy low transmission nation small cluster become dominant variant, much compete begin with.

. asked, variant long feared vaccine resistant version. said, possible PARTIALLY immune vaccines? Yes. STRONG, STRONG doubts fully immune. need data, stuff already knows, feels absolute worse case, variant would lower booster protection 75%. paranoid, careful. sadly lot evidence six foot back concern. it’s worldwide. Bummer. Boy hope vaccines work Yeah no. could double pay, doctors nurses wouldn’t suddenly pop ground. doesn’t work way. letting say it, me? us medical practitioners, picked up, last week, different clinical pictures, looked advisory committees far seen mild cases. [I’m] sure arms.""

Lets see gets removed third time. seriously think virus killing entire world? people die annually heart disease COVID society functioning fine. 

I’m selfish I’m realistic. never said don’t wear masks don’t get vaccinated…but spend next indefinite period lockdown isn’t going solve it’s going make things better. got pfizer booster 3 weeks ago.  Xi's first.

Oh, coed sport now?  Stay Brazil  got booster week come Omicron booster would mean I’d get also? much boosting becomes negative body all? comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* makes sense. I’ve traveling France cold week ago got tested second day wasn’t feeling well case didn’t problem getting tested.  Riiiight, except funding ended, portion increased capacity reverted back previous use became something else. bigger concern would lack staff. Mass exodus nursing many areas due burn out, deaths staff Covid, additional exodus healthcare workers vaccination requirements… think places better regard supplies currently, there’s that. fact don’t much solid information new variant going behave.  :( they're saying news domination already started already twice posted sources, get removed mods. much else do.  100% variant. amount reserves released nothing comparison actual consumption. example India uses 4.8m day released 5m, US released 50m consumes around 19m day. care mortality spread fast enough. Yes.

Also, get high filtration efficiency masks. Masks operate exponential curve. means 50% filtration efficiency (cotton mask fully cover face) 95%+ filtration efficiency (KN94, KN95, N95, etc. good face fit) dramatically different levels protection.

 suggest mask youtube channel guy named Aaron Collins. Long videos basically reviews efficacy Masks and, least one video, talks exponential curves way makes easy understand EVERYONE wears mask wearing high filtration efficiency masks. real though, it’s deer population knows else. arrogant think aren’t subject corrective measures species exceeds planets ability care it. I'm means expert take following grain salt.

What red Wikipedia there's plenty coronaviruses, cause mainly common cold. instace guess Covid pandemic eventually end two ways. 
First one variant emerge, contagious, less severe current ones.
Second one immune systems humans become accustomed covid-viruses.
In scenarios anymore meaningful call situation pandemic disease resambles common cold flu. scenarios people risk groups take yearly booster vaccine. many areas, hospitals already struggling, cancelling elective procedures, unable find beds critical patients - height flu season hit yet.

And yet, stores packed today unmasked shoppers. hopes anything getting better anytime soon. Absolutely, said one sample (and self-selected one booth, reason got tested begin ill). also true evidence whatsoever may less severe previous variants X, taking drug X solve one problems, potentially making easier deal one Sooooo, Belgium? Home EU? 😁 happened predicted happen humans planet earth couldn’t vaccinated within months, thus many viral replications thus occur, teeing variants. Hate say it, travel prohibited while. EU countries, to/from US, Africa, Asia. Close airports except freight. forever, maybe month 2, 3. Well, comment wasn’t really meant reassuring, lol. It’s is. AFAIK, there’s much predict specific mutations regarding severity illness. hear you. Last time visited family September 2019. Meanwhile, grandfather passed away, New cousins born, feel isolated.  we've seen ZERO evidence fact previous strains that's I'm asking. History time
Do rhyme Scabble? That’s nice game.  Poor Art Vandelay Hate say it, travel prohibited while. EU countries, to/from US, Africa, Asia. Close airports except freight. forever, maybe month 2, 3. data yet characteristics new variant? know scared be. Africa guess

Africa young population.

It's RIP Europe really. Ehhhh, I'd rather die. may lost PTSD ages this, thing risk lot people become numb it. There's much isolation fear person tolerate snap. Hopefully snap it, opposed something worse.

Government response vary country country. US finished lockdowns, nobody stomach try one. likely lockdowns various EU countries sentiment becomes toxic it. nations accept COVID fact life spend resources energy protecting highest risk go seen ""reckless"" panicking case counts seen forward thinking.  like mom saw last night thanksgiving ABS CBS, NBC, TBN, CNN NAFTA reporting scene great people mountain. scientist teams trying different ways get rid it.....today news, Scientists Hilbert Roberts demonstrate new people solvent ""SX37"", is. Dr. Gilbert, explain procedure?. Quite certainly! need cup SX37 dead relatives, pets even neighbors people never seen before. Again, must dead. pile bodies like this. We're using remains 4 cats, grandma, cousin Eddie, body one guy matrix. know ""guy shakes fists neo steals phone"". Anyway, pile pour. sure spill loved ones may dead already. do, jump top pour more. less painful way. touch anyone. wait seconds reaction. see, dissolved useful tar. see got camera man. Sorry man, better come jump pile. He's running. worry, brought super soaker! really seems case people looking graph showing proportions variant extrapolating top extrapolations claiming kind super virus become dominant matter days (think absurd sounds). based barely 100 cases region non-existent vaccination coverage almost zero cases Delta. need take breath wait data *actually* shows cause concern. Either brave stupid travel Egypt (around 40% vaccinated) without vaccinated :/  thing Corona is, habit headstart data troubles catching up.

I'm troubled, much beyond masks, test boosters, can't say yet much reassuring ring it. anymore. hundreds last flight Gauteng landing London asked self-isolate, released upon world. course there’s new variant, updates keep coming can’t  N95 Definitely feeling quite upset news today, mention exhausted last 18 months. booked yesterday finally go visit grandparents abroad incredibly important me, last went 2019 can't help worrying time may get another opportunity. I'm dreading government impose travel restrictions although course want everyone remain safe possible. hitting close home today second daughter May, spent entire pregnancy alone, spend last Christmas family due tier 4 restrictions looking like able take daughters see great grandparents. difficult time many people booking flights yesterday, felt excited again, now, feel dread news going change day now.  It’s Belgium already, it’s late lol appreciate optimism. think us become jaded pessimistic watching shit show past two years. want hope it’s nothing freak though.  Hate say it, travel prohibited while. EU countries, to/from US, Africa, Asia. Close airports except freight. forever, maybe month 2, 3. Yes much deadlier - estimated killed 50,000,000 global population 2 billion. 2.5% population

Covid what, 10,000,000 deaths 7.5 billion? 0.13% total population. 

So covid fewer deaths raw numbers far fewer proportion. 


Spanish flu also high mortality rate 20-40 age group, uncommon pandemics makes spanish flu far deadlier covid. killed healthy, young people, also lots infants. Luckily, covid deaths skew heavily towards elderly. UK, average age covid death 80.


The number quality life adjusted years (QALY) lost Spanish flue therefore much much higher  Two things: Egypt closer Belgium physically terms transport networks South Africa. 

There thing spreading across African continent. world connected say that. spread around world. South Africa connected China Congo. Senegal connected UK SA. huge continent without connecting railways entire southern Africa little regional air traffic. elaborate: ""An attenuated vaccine (or live attenuated vaccine, LAV) vaccine created reducing virulence pathogen, still keeping viable (or ""live""). Attenuation takes infectious agent alters becomes harmless less virulent."" reading covid vaccines:  We're basically living meme:

""No God, please, no! Nooooooooooo!""  mean ""lately""? No—it’s definitely not. boosters create lot antibodies. antibodies act first line defense floating around attaching virus. Hopefully don’t even get infected.

The original shot’s antibodies would already dispersed… still Tcell Bcells trained fight virus first shot. problem don’t activate you’re infected.

So booster helps prevent getting infected. fails antibodies bind replicated virus prevent serious infection. You’re B cells also help.

So want booster help prevent infection ward infection super quickly. order them? Thanks!!  Good lord…..here fucking go!!!! It’s over. nice run everybody. Chise, account furry icon, best try calm people down:

. Said way variant virus 100%, completely vaccine resistant. 

. Says certain people saying ""oh, 500% easier spread,"" talking bullshit. zero data prove right now.

. people say ""oh, outcompeting Delta,"" important realize South Africa, Delta cases lowest ever variant came in. COURSE cases would higher.

. ask, mentioning South Africa 24% fully vaccinated? telling people mutations equal bad?

. seeing people say going lower vaccine protection 30%. Um, again, data that, chill stop spreading fear paranoia like media does.

. conclusion, reason believe get vaccinated get booster shot, able make one too. suggest turning news living life, short get consumed news.  Uhhhh Punishment worshipping altar growth costs. Yawn best Rapid tests correctly diagnose asymptomatic asymptomatic covid 52% timw Source? recall correctly good thing mRna vaccines adapt rather quickly. 

I sure prefer vaccine, even protection perfect, hoping new drugs help get servere case. I'll stick this. media pretty much blew new variant proportion ""yes"" company would keen losing financial future.

Surely point corporate profits take backseat lives livelihoods entirety humanity.

A pandemic treated like we're wartime footing. vaccines provided close cost, government step nationalise it. paramedic, I'll waiting give hug side. holiday season spread virus across country, probably Nu. quit I’ll fucken again!! stating mutations work, actually know patient? would impressive Thank answer. also found explanation online author. shown relative explanation, seems enough effects changing stance vaccines. 

His stance seems change ""Vaccines side effects kill injected"" ""this paper shows media misrepresenting effectiveness vaccines"", essentially evades criticism. even shown wrong particular case, treating symptoms, root problem. 

He skepticism science published papers produce/manipulate data fitting ideas provide funding, funders want say Astra Zeneca effective, papers say so. also says researches point long term effects vaccines, may harmful side effects. seem aware following anti-vaccine beliefs (we USA, family members aware American politics propaganda), makes frustrating explain.

I'm sure proceed this. like arguing politics general, think anyone change stance one argument. ***What hope convince relative, family members even side-effects vaccines, still worth taking vaccine shot***. help sometimes country's media post stories like people get shocked injecting vaccines even straight dying. anyone thread help this, grateful. Well, new see, blaming article little dumb,

You assume bad things reasonably happen will, sooner later, rather clinging lofty hope, respond appropriately. Listening government officials half reason we’re fucked first place … History repeat, rhyme.  oof merck antivrial data good.

Because whole section talks lack SUPPLY nurses! even talked lack training resources. literally enough nursing instructors train number nurses need!

It even talked highly paid travel nurse positions unable filled. 

This exact kind utter nonsense hate online dialog. clearly know nothing subject, yet spout authoritatively. Idk posting cv incredibly good  look Twitter, us get infected end next week. Time every government world take measures late all. Lets go. Since variant significantly different spike protein, possible symptoms COVID-19 know change? like Delta, runny nose became frequent loss smell rare. chart like half year ago virus spreads even less severe kill people, good thing. Especially considering viruses spread exponentially.

old variant: less infectious, severe (1%): 100 people get 1 die. 
new variant: infectious, less severe (0.1%): 10.000 people get 10 people die.  Dude use one 😷 end.

as long theres countrys cant vaccinate near 100% fully 100% theres countrys low vac rates allways new mutations. mutation rate much much higher flu, basically get completely new flu strain every season need get shot it. covid however first vaccine protective variants part Yeah sure important mention woman visited Egypt, course thousands kms Southern Africa.

This points fact new variant spreading time across continent Testing variables account this. Germany like many nations loosened testing requirements vaccinated tightened requirements unvaccinated. take guns away. nuts fly without causing trouble, shouldn’t able guns. felon cannot guns. fact 200 comments early really means Nu scaring shit everyone. hope info vax performed variant labs soon. somehow feels different lambda, last time things dramatic got delta. we’ve got wait data. also funny enough seems everywhere Black Friday now. Seen tons ads Spain. already Isreal  get booster shot likely consequences health eventually catch it. 3 vaccines + 1 cure virus = 4 protections stacked top eachother. It’s probably us already… people washed hands (Saddens many dont) wore masks voluntary especially rules state masks need worn (Not difficult, bad asthma anxiety wear mine 9+ hours day outdoor kiosk protect others) social distanced (which personal space, want anyone within 2 meters tbh) we'd better covid either. everyone start part. Right 10-20% morons refuse vaccine, refuse wear simple mask, etc.. dragging everyone them. South African scientists policy makers really done commendable job transparent quick variant, give best world chance handle correctly. actually uploaded sequence data cycle, realized important. I'm sure knew one responses would travel bans them.  
I imagine probably least countries would made choice. go again... Exactly that. Plus, close borders introduce major restrictions, cause riots; sure even vaccine supporters furious. all, vaccine answer also highly transmissible also less severe ... Spanish flu ended. like this. are. know gets data several studies place reduction transmission rate high peacock  
Worth emphasising super low numbers right region Africa fairly well sampled, however much monitored due **horrific spike profile** (would take guess would worse antigenically nearly anything else about) Fuck right. all. Firstly vaccine still effective, secondly large majority Europeans vaccinated, thirdly late anyway. 

This causes lot hardship many people reason, politicians look like something.

At point life must go on. choose vaccinate, them. like plot Contagion, recall. public health people urging local government shut shopping Black Friday. cabinet meeting convened Friday discuss new variant, Prime Minister said new variant contagious spreads rapidly Delta variant. said also concern high number mutations, scientists still gathering data whether evade vaccines. used test things figure unknowns forced people take something too. half testing done per capita New York... Omega Virus Guess never wrong life. guess 64 kbits would enough storage application computers. would like Apple naming scheme. Nu MacBook Pro. Hard say got info, FWIW: They're 'variants' 'strain' SARV-COV-2. read border closures find shit like I’m like “why even bother”


I mean, think it’s right thing obviously really feels like we’re fucked really try slow things bit. fucking end week sure hope so. Better safe sorry. Anyone traveling across borders right needs prepared quarantined honestly. news Israel Belgium knowing Belgium case probably got Egypt probably way widespread realize. meant quite quickly meaning ""in months"" hence need booster, meaning ""in days"" common knowledge contagion period

In Europe vaxxed people vaccinated spring might prone catch transmit, take less precautions vaccinated nonetheless 

At least that's reason third doses pushed right it? Stop watching news. propaganda fear mongering. grown up, that’s got vaccinated don’t treat like joke. Could name something less ominous? Like Jolly Strawberry Ice Cream? Variants searched across world literally time. Thats know literally hundreds them. Wtf comment downvoted? Must serious brigading going ITT. Everyone knows unvaccinated undervccinated walking breathing pl*gue r*ts deserve sympathy support us, responsible vaxxers (3+ doses only). think that? LOOOL what! 
Ok let’s make decisions know every single thing know. You’re delusional Yeah, could've mutated somewhere high vaccination rate, traveled south Africa reaked havoc  impression article Prime Minister Israel unnecessary fear mongering? specifies NEVER learn.  recently buried fully-vaccinated friend. might made overwhelmed hospital struggled give care needed. 

I another friend got breakthrough case last month still struggling fatigue. 

It seems like outcomes worthy concern. Lrrr, ruler omicron variant 8 going catch virus

possibly multiple times. can't draw useful conclusions assumption once. normal anxiety getting car? Anxiety evolutionary beneficial thing work help us survive fight another day speak. 

It good overly anxious, anxiety caution good thing. figured skipped Nu “new nu variant” super confusing, especially next “new nu” one comes. It’s like Abbott Costello pandemic edition. 

And Xi bad political connotations. Also one knows pronounce it. 

So Omicron is.  Hospitalization information simply can't available yet. first sequenced case Omicron sampled 15 days ago. South Africa sequences good percentage cases must among first 100 ish seen country.

This like previous variants see coming months advance. South Africa's case numbers suggest outcompeting delta far rapidly we've seen (or numbers wrong, could likely). mutations associated immune evasion prior variants. It’s likely dampen vaccine natural immunity significant degree. said almost certainly won’t case vaccines “won’t work” efficacy severe disease especially likely preserved, especially booster shots. would wonderful went mild, cold like. I’m scared hope. precedence something like /s Shit that's scary af. Market tanking hard right American ""billionaire boys club"" fabricated new variant divert everyone's attention perform damage control. 

Heaven forbid millions billions people around world turn TV see news next pending crash.

Hey let's another variant! Give scariest name possible. Stop travelling around damn Petri dishes  ""Omnicron"", yeah sound ominous all... thought going name Nu. sequenced, lot data wild yet R, vaccine response, previous infection response. good news worldwide variant detection response system working. fr tho, people wanna lockdown forever? Oh sure. partner get 3 different vaccines 2014 work children’s special needs school, compulsory, one saying omg government control!! god dude Following! Please let us know find Friendship ended antibodies, B cells new best friends Nah, one *incredibly* easy spot via testing: Much like Alpha, run PCR, fail segment test, don’t sequence actually locate it: Standard testing locate local spread time. is. say feels weird came week thanksgiving. Probably coincidence still. yes know rest world doesn’t celebrate thanksgiving. Yeah don’t really think Africa capable detecting new variants it’s late whatever reason seems good place virus mutate idk travel isn’t stricter continent Far soon know. wait find secret…masks never worked according science! Chinese delayed COVID, require vaccination everyone won’t big problem ever. helping economy, since got control beginning 2020, regional lockdowns short, economy fares much better meantime. right know yet? answer no. Thank you. simulation complete, could report back results? Specifically mutation causes virus bind ""stronger"" ACE 2 likely already late now. Oh good send data 4th shot long last? side effects increase decrease? 4 others fully vaccinated... stop spreading across world, maybe slow down? seems like buying time important prepare response. Dumb Trump it, dumb Biden it. remember guys saying delta. fucking crushed Surely 2 years could upgraded nurses physicians assistants, care aids nurses, etc. Especially focused intensivist practice certified full breadth care. Lockdowns ain’t returning. Lmao “your kind” Imagine saying human 2021. I’m fully vaxxed hell yea life without fear Soemthing won’t hurt saved millions people death. scam get Covid Classic back shelves high-fructose protein spike instead cane spike everyone knew loved. bet jack price 😤 works. virus process cleared body roundabout two weeks. relatively short therapeutic window opportunity intervention targeting virus itself. 
Clearing also happens faster places first entered, throat nose. places also reservoir transmissions via droplets. Health care workers usually get infected new arrivals, people ventilators. Never knew American Democrats involved virology South Africa. Hey, live learn, guess. Especially, person travel SA Belgium past 11 days? stopovers airports? travelled airports time stopover? tiny aerosol needed could got anywhere. there's one thing I've learnt pandemic, origin stories change radically one new data point. almost criminal unvaccinated people allowed travel populations - that's something must definitely happen definitely control. No? He’s always pro vax already everywhere. We're looking past every time data gets analyzed. ""I'm gettin old shit"" easy enough US close airspace got land borders near impossible; look way migration takes place Asia Africa across land western Europe see that.  Northeast people known blunt. grew Florida seen changes. Florida rude soon back visit notice it. hey like live sandbar go it. data wildly extrapolated based insufficient information. That’s spread SA appears scary, Let’s least wait days get hard data declaring end humanity. 

Also, even new variant totally completely defeats vaccines (a rather unlikely scenario) do? Well, already know technology make new vaccine highly effective. we’ll er…. that. *By 25th November 2021, B.1.1.529 variant detected 77 samples collected 12-20 November Gauteng province South Africa, 4 samples Botswana 1 sample Hong Kong.* -[Africa would hope Africa receiving help resources stop-flight mandates.

Let's say 100-300 people... That's it. now?

I'm Flemish grave = serious. Belgium use flu-like symptomes everything resembles respiratory virus (at least sick notes) heavy cold. instance, got sick vaccin two days mild flu-like symptoms. generally rule virus variants competing other, logic killing host soon compromises ability spread others. However, covid deaths happen quite late on, time people milder illness longer infectious, fear logic breaks case covid. Yes does. read article, Mayo Clinic defines long Covid symptoms lasting longer four weeks recovery. So, since people don’t symptoms last longer several weeks, don’t get long covid. think poor people don’t die rich live lavishly?   imagine country broken healthcare system needing new lungs ""new common cold"" Solidarity, hope get care need soon. Stuck living nightmare eternity well there’s evidence that, would probably offset less effective vax anyway (for vaxxed) time reasonable realistic rather expectant now. 

keep mind roughly everything stupids would react spot prediction-wise. hate comparison everyone makes. earth living thing. lifeless ball metal rock. happens living things upon it. unvaccinated

Key point. Thanks! ones based inactivated virus?  vaccinated might become even important (obviously catches new variant) doesn’t specify long Covid. Doubtful since there’s lot genomic sequencing going there’d already announcement they’re connected Remember COVID new thing, MSM tried say ""it bad - get lung transplants""?

Fucking ridiculous. patient question young unvaccinated woman

Surprise surprise two weeks spread. transmissible delta pretty much everywhere already That's even literally works matter virus starts saying you’re wrong confirmed found someone America yet? funny ... country imposing restrictions. country form ""lockdown"".

Hats large part big cities US high vaccination rates vs rural areas.

The early hit big cities meant everyone knew couple people (at least) got sick (at least).

From first wave NY without even trying count five people, including one left widowed.

All part allowed political narratives take hold (since rural people didn’t see reality/media bubble). mean something like… vaccine? That's something know, many anti-vax crowd thinks immune forever natural.  


The say: ""what's better immunity working? "". people lucky get it; know people got survivor biasis. Let rephrase, seem focused semantics:

Of 32 spike mutations, 11 novel currently unknown, 7 known seen VOC, perhaps concerning two (S477N Q498R) extremely rare find together, models show likely increases transmissibility.

Like everyone I’m hoping B1.1.529 isn’t monster seems potential be.

David Pakman cited sources recent video. going continue, first Nations boosters.

with money spend policing world, could fix **all** problems here... Happy Nu Year guys :/ me, thing. isolate spread bs I'm worried. insist marching main street without masks, take exception. Due nature virus logical assume one case confirmed, hot spot identified, actual spread happened weeks prior cases identified. That's travel bans usually amount much considering everything lags behind much. new variant already traveling while. is. change anything. 

I surprised variant responsible crazy numbers Germany unpopular opinion, think travel areas world low vaccine uptake high potential new variants (such Africa) always subject quarantine testing

You right, government's flatfooted slow covid-19 day 1 left travel open told everyone wear masks. That… literally “economics” work.

It's like vaccinate entire world once. thought gonna 'nu'? Yeah error bars mortality transmissibility really make trapezoid uncertainty Assault resulting jail time criminal case. fine civil case. Usually lawyers wait criminal case done pursuing civil charges. increases odds winning. Believe not…. SPY time high Joker Heath ledger meme...""And go""  There's absolutely evidence this.

40% positive tests taken fully vaccinated people, almost 60% unvaccinated.

Despite fact 70% vaccinated. Lrrr, ruler planet Omicron Persei 8 blame this? scientists 'concerned' far could read. However, also quoted 6 times higher R0 without questioning it. would eclipse measles. level-headed ones pointed variant around undetected months already likely didnt start 0 2 weeks ago. would put R0 reasonable figure. worked China Lockdowns stop original COVID. They're certainly going stop variant 10X transmissible. even *less* likely work people already endured 2 years full partial lockdown. 

I know solution is, hard lockdown gonna work. disagree all. already knew travel bans hygiene theatre best, SA minister health literally gave press conference stating reason believe new variant evade vaccine protection otherwise dangerous existing ones. way playing bizarre me, cause concern all, recorded cases results either no, mild symptoms. Even *unvaccinated* people. really proving testament government incompetence.  also know evades vaccine so, extent. Maybe previous 90 percent 75. maybe non sever infections low protection hospitalization death still low. maybe we’re fucked. It’s determined. Keep eye reports drs overseas though cdc probably won’t officially acknowledge anything it’s already late (at least that’s trend past 2 years) go again...again. Sorry, mentioning existence rumor. giving legs. 

It reported new strain known issue 7 days news broke today. 

Weird US cases time high week two weeks though. Again, proof read article. Travel nurse spots going vacant 2x 3x pay.  Oh yeah. “In May 2021, Centers Disease Control officially recognized SARS-CoV-2—the virus causes COVID-19—is airborne, meaning highly transmissible likely already SAYS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS LATEST CORONAVIRUS VARIANT CARRIES HIGHER RISK REINFECTION VARIANTS CONCERN SAYS NUMBER CASES OMICRON VARIANT APPEARS INCREASING ALMOST PROVINCES SOUTH AFRICA many vaccinated people Netherlands 'I got vaccination part whatever want'-mentlity I’m sorry needle phobia. don’t like either. 2022 (2020 too) again!

I guess mostly see lot assumptions made threads I’m pushing back bit.  

We know two three weeks..  

But saying people caught unvaccinated speculation.  basis really. Anyone know hitting Germany right now? delta new one? interesting see infectious version mortality hospitalization stays lower. Omicron, eh?  can't turn away patient vaccinated. Crisis care emergency triage emergency, way different. might want Google Emergency Medical Treatment Labor Act  'Muricans 2024 like But, may stupid question, say mutation something like 50% mortality. causes die infects communities world. understand virus interest kill host fast efficiently, little less lethal, threshold really really bad world. obviously virus **know** serious. literally know yet.   Well, like sparsely distributed everywhere around Africa. 'everywhere' Delta one. Otherwise, would found way around. guess SA case local cluster everyone freaking Well suppose be. Maybe there's exponential correlation? Idk, structural biology never thing. earliest vaccines similar this. smallpox vaccine live, shared people direct contact scab. made easy make available every corner earth (and smallpox eradicated). first polio vaccines also live, low chance actually mutating back dangerous strain. actually prevented total eradication, people would get vaccine become positive carrier one trying eliminate. better vaccines polio. data sequenced sample used track variant. could less transmissible.

My guess less Delta naive populations, might enough escape compete it.  That's great governments always want seem like they're something.

It’s already done. state declare crises care emergency. please no... dont want happen again... please... i'm damn sick pandemic Pfizer one well supposedly better Beside* point African healthcare workers still unvaccinated. deal directly highly infectious COVID patients every day.

I call courage guts, dedication.

I doubt they'd mind chills fever night. Nobody twitter said 8x mortality. said 8x transmissibility based data currently disputed due Belgian case  actually thought year ago would great concept novel. modified virus could highly infectious, far less virulent, also provide immunity original strains.  modified virus would essentially inoculate population.

For novel, original strain would deadly (20% case fatality rate) modified virus far less still significantly deadly (2-3% case fatality rate).

The ethical dilemma - ethical kill tens million save hundreds millions?

My idea rogue CDC employee finally smuggles modified strain save hundreds millions lives. Without lot harder protect vulnerable people can't vaccinated.

Bingo. absolutely right. Unfortunately, even vaccines perfect, COVID-19 would disappear always people refuse take vaccine.

Just look HIV. could completely eradicated easily everyone got tested, people get tested consequence continues us. vaccinated doesn’t stop getting virus, know right? OMG MUCH CONTROL IM CONTROLLED! 

 
 Anyway, back watching football, eating leftovers, probably nap run dog. ""Oh vaccinated people got boosters living lives, can't that!"" mention symptoms caught screening travelers likely symptoms tested. work mostly outdoors still...my 3 main coworkers refuse get vaccinated. I've got savings. Maybe I'll quit enjoy winter home wife, toddler, infant. Also anti-maskers cough breathe germs air grocery stores. everyone masked practiced social distancing, there'd much lower transmission rates. Take look vaccination shedules. see pretty packed. year influenza shot, 6+ DTap shots children 6 (every 10 years adults), every 6 years TBE, pneumo/HEPB/MenC least 3 times, MMR least 2 times etcetc

On top immune system comes contact patogens time, kills builds antibodies them. immune system handle much 5-6 shots. patogen isnt seen body longer time antibodies sorted out. cells detect patogen time quickly produce antibodies high numbers. People increasingly don’t give fuck virus either. Huh why? That’s mutations function. Flights halted variants. Lambda Mu. sure downvoted actually watched movie last week haha! default country selected Mexico Russia third one currently remember. Italy Greece two countries hit hardest covid early on. adjust default settings show two countries adjust January March see rise excess deaths.

I appreciate providing link. There’s nothing wrong wanting avoid COVID due fears lingering issues post infection, I’m saying wouldn’t go around saying agree citing ‘I good health still worry’ don’t really good health lol. Omicronpussyiate That's besides point wrong. how? before. WTF. 

This drunk guy asshole. people violent. I’ll take study founded CDC random redditor saying it’s fact. catchy name all. Hopefully actual strain either.  stupid take. know South Africa Europe broke news first right? would orchestrate conspiracy theory American holiday? Let cope Based evidence? Oh yeah none Me: restrict travel SA countries.

You: shouldn't.

US: we're restricting travel SA countries.

That's wrong. Good day. hell, better response delta lot places ""it's fine, everything fine - India... oh now? Shit.""  idk man one lot mutations 30% particularly good result. Though 30% better nothing, suppose. something...

It ensure next country notices new variant report early shut world due panic. Enjoy policies added prevent data sharing. fully vaxxed hell yea life without fear Soemthing won’t hurt me

American ignorance, arrogance full display. Lrrrr Sigma variant biblical level threat supposed PM I'm dead dead everyone dead?!?! They're calling Omicron variant. Every December seems like already started breh Sahara well central African rainforest region easy get through. Go check Skyscanner. Compare Europe Africa. feel like way late shut travel anywhere tbh. People flat give shit. 

I remember Covid first hit asia videos weird chinese app (tik tok) people contactless delivery videos chinese government locking apartments saying can't leave.

Even China contain it. past point pretend going go away responsible get rid it. going away. People like travel, people like social, year we're tired it. question “why new variant cause alarm”. doesn’t take peer reviewed study understand answer. People, especially children still unable get vaccinated, worried effect themselves, friends families. ringer ever changing pandemic. keep thinking see light end tunnel. Then, something changes again. US banned flights explain ways? protein structure changed lot? stay home much possible. fully committed beginning see anybody 6 months. got together friend sometime last year, caught covid. Recovered never same. fully vaccinated wear mask wherever go. make sure part.

You think want stay home? used go gym everyday longer do, end feeling ""sick"" cannot explain why. Evolution amazing, it? either going outcompete Delta not. big question vaccines effective something rip population vaccinated still get anxiety covid go see therapist (online) continues mutate, get older, eventually die infected enough times. Probably sooner protected meaningful measurable capacity. hits keep coming. Existing vaccines effective, updated vaccines could far effective. Switching new doses could improve outcomes dramatically mean everyone who's gotten three doses needs fourth one. comes strawman... tried US, paying people increase uptake significantly. Tells ceos politicians privy insider information hasn’t made public yet.

No doesn't. tells people concerned could mean people selling. speculation. omnicron part Decepticons? Autobots, ROLL OUT. [CNN good piece Basically issue vaccines work based giving us immunity recognizing COVID spike proteins. variant 30 mutations protein, meaning there's good chance immunity, acquired passive, going effective.  VOI's *predicted* worse transmissibility, virulence, immune escape, therapeutic response, diagnostic difficulties. 

VOC's *demonstrated* worse transmissibility etc.

Because Omicron shares signature Alpha variant common TaqPath PCR kit, namely true positives orf1-ab N genes, false negatives gene, tracked without time/expense whole genome sequencing.

In yesterday's briefing, South Africa's Department Health showed evidence rapidly growing proportion ""S-dropout"" positive cases, multiple provinces, early Nov 20 Nov. fully sequenced Omicron (77 genomes yesterday) mostly case tracking single cluster around Tshwane, little background transmission variants, growth ""S-dropout"" positive cases provinces demonstrated worse transmissibility.  it’s worth, [officially calling Omicron variant. think must’ve another strain named “nu” people missed, thought one must get “nu” name. Regardless, looks like it’s Omicron variant. China delayed COVID way going beat long haul. today's world, draconian measures isolationism sustainable decades. Eventually, they'll let rip want keep increasing sustaining standard living. ticking time bomb know it. It’s wonderful time year! gonna part like it’s December 2019  mean public threads statements scientists raising alarms red flags created headline. Look news cycle today, even market. looking likely big one. similar. gets worse(way worse) sucks. Word advice. get pre anxious variant know nothing about. Remember virus almost always slowly mutates less deadly. 12388 arrived Hong Kong November 11 checked hotel day. specimen taken November 13 tested positive Ct value 18 sent hospital November 14. case 12388, ""patient zero"" case, double-vaccinated Pfizer May/June. 8x lethality evidence? even know killed one person.  ""as contagious"" Delta outcompeting Delta spread would far contained drawn time case Belgium picked Egypt, safe say spread across Africa SA first pick up. real evidence. 2-3 weeks enough testing done strain verify whether good potential evade vaccines. reason much speculation worry 30 mutations spike protein. Since vaccines use spike protein, many changes raises chances recognized immune system.  Europe heading winter. Cases already high. Even can't prevent arriving, need try delay much possible already going difficult winter. Denmark mask mandates all. two days…  recently announced calling omicron that's probably going stop Nu references. They're literally thing, agreed upon convention terms (source: I'm literally ""strain engineer"" microbes call genetic change, matter minor, ""strain"") Omicron virus definitely guns arms, transform high trim level Honda Accord. don’t see evidence anything highly contagious variant. Recall tried contain Delta UK?

We even close surveillance needed. truly bad it’s already place fucking go again. Smh elaborate layman? okay, we'll find safe long-term forcing everybody take months. Please listen this....it either things. Dont care give 10000 people die day USA another Typhoid Mary….enough enough.

No vaccine travel.

Oh wait, forgot Wall Street needs travel money, bad. Headlines aren’t scientists. Scientists scientists. major plot point movie *Contagion* local officials drag feet imposing lockdown measures want interfere Thanksgiving Black Friday. movie fucking prophetic. variant stopping seeing family? Sadly Dems still do. That’s 2022 *really* looking good :( ~~Ivermectin /s~~ should.

People scared refused go 2003 facing SARS Hong Kong, case now. 

I hope find silver bullet like facing Smallpox. think go flu way, need vaccine Tamiflu back normal.

Before that, quarantine one way, taking vaccine another way, wearing mask third way. refusing them, good luck. Thank you, similar thinking of. Thanks.  previous new strains effect markets though... idea obviously something different here? maybe? fucking knows data wild claim? Especially data accounts correlation vaccination resources testing resources? Yup, way would translate selective pressure deadly enough scare crap people acting different. Like Ebola deadly even uneducated populations act differently pops up. ever happen? I’m US haven’t even touched 60% adults county, 12-18 even lower we’re hours major city (Chicago).

mandatory vaccination everyone health wise.

easy solution. saves tons lifes. saves tons misery.

doesnt crash fiancial markets stuff. it? know good selection healthy vaccinated people got covid pretty bad. We're gonna neef shit ton toilet paper Definitely! (probably stolen others, claiming creativity :) two theories partially explain (and work together).

1. Getting COVID gives immunity time. people susceptible whichever variant going time. virus hits those, goes away months.
2. People change behavior lot (on average), regardless mandates. virus bad region, wear masks distance; easy, relax. I'm sure that. understanding, H1N1 strain caused Spanish Flu super short incubation time. People would get infected drop dead later day. Even severe cases COVID, medical intervention, usually takes days illness get really bad. think *just* modern medicine, even though plays part. I'm san francisco, lockedown March, lot cities. Good morning.

This guy interesting tweets it. Meanwhile, Canada:  wondering thing Plague Inc continues we? 

We've cruising 30-50k cases day 4 months now. Bro even heard vaxx shedding? /s boosters given poorer countries got fair share vaccines. That's real problem, vaccine inequality Right. police refuse wear masks (at least see locally statistics COVID #1 leading cause death among police nationwide). Regardless, people make commercial air flight dangerous, impede travel, prosecuted, can't go stand middle highway stomp foot cry that's right much traffic. Hail Victors! corrective measures? virus virus does, greater implication sentient planet attached. new neighbors move constantly annoy 10 hours per day end also virus things adapt complaining landlord moving. There's noone tells complain move though, could also sit take annoyance. evolution work. bothers people saying viruses generally mutate less deadly contagious.

Guess what. None matters ability infect incubation period. selective pressure less deadly variants. virus even able prolong period, get away practically anything. new variant arrived! 

B.1.1.529 hopefully across US take vaccine

My small rural county Florida 33-35% fully vaccinated. Unbelievable.  still doubt vaccines stop working variant, people unvaccinated save everyone though. People die become disabled car accidents everyday. Yet write comments driving ruin life.   Yes, boosting absolutely makes sense.  controlling? concerned leading toward? Fearmonger much? Time live life stop crap. proof variant going said. people realize Covid. people show symptoms 1 day, never, 2 weeks later. 

The quarantine period funsies  joke strat playing plague inc. make virus transmissible first lots people catch go deadly possible fast possible kill everyone react. I’m sure don’t risk reacting. little data right doubt sort secret knowledge rest scientific community doesn’t have. gave reasoning said due preliminary data already have. it’s totally unrelevant condition. COVID treatment supports growth seems unreasonable. Early makes absolutely sense reduce spread gain time advantage. German virologists agreed quick response stopping flights key. Yes, thanks...I job, cannot glued social media. Yeah that... certainly work Please keep mind two outcomes possible, death long term side effects. vast majority people fine.

Also probably Nu Variant Nu Strain sounds like nu metal album title. Everyone Twitter decided would called Nu shambles Tell it, country got first big batch Chinese covid vaccines knew pretty bad, nobody said sounded like antivax… no, saying vaccine good vaccine ok, science. really lol Unfortunately, South Africa supply problem here. True countries though. We'll alright guys. last 2 years increased capacity hospital beds ventilators... right? fun fair Hull! twice definitely going back next year!  would say months May introduce religious beliefs? definitely matter. know comparison may absolutely ridiculous like comparing shot shot forty times. one bullet could kill also could hitting anything vital. like way reduced viral load may lead infection less spread, one bullet may lead death less damage Yep 🙁 could vaccine resistant strain, unvaxx &amp; vaxxed would suffer. vaccine resistant strain doesnt ask vaccine papers infecting ass sending ICU later 6 feet ground! Flying sky important public health. know Western countries going hard lockdown like that. Another six-month-long half lockdown going solve anything. Vaccinated people catch transmit quite quickly shot, strain could worse regard.

Not sure vaccines based first strain silver bullet Omicron - sound slightest bit ominous...

Beats Nu though - we'd talking Nu variant people offline would think talking new variant. would essentially 'Who's First?', coronavirus edition. fact county state politician supported mask requirements lost election help. Honestly think will, least we're better position do. Could someone break nomenclature names variants? I’m interested B1.1.529 stands for. new variant name? Delta's effectiveness surprised lot people think. mutations investigated heavily. Omicron lot mutations known scary. increasing cases quickly, ticks boxes easily. could eradicated everyone they’re supposed do. alas, never happen. Omnicron sounds like Cyborg Villain Japanese Anime. deadly pathogen ripping populations around world, tune 5 million deaths 2 years. suggesting would better knowing mutates properties variant? It’s fear, it’s information preparedness.

Listen yourself. advocating replacement knowledge ignorance. replacement humanity’s best defenses with… nothing. want prolong situation? Because, again, listen yourself. directly advocating continuance deadly disease around world stifling information reduction life-saving mitigations.

You arguing side pandemic. part problem. rational people get news YouTube? never heard source ;) Yeah. can't believe people still believe viruses sentient point time. Wooo, Calm buddy. 


I believe minority saying preffer reduced lung capacity all. miserable people us option staying home. Time Molecular Transmutation! found Nu variant Hong Kong Israel well. Israel little closer Egypt. likely every continent already (obvs Antarctica, ya never know.) Let's hope dangerous existing vaccine somewhat effective it. I'm guessing be. Maybe *as* effective, close enough. not, within year, strain specific booster. keep wearing mask, keep distance, keep keeping on. Yes. lot depends length pre-symptomatic contagious period, activities undertaken time spread it. wondering too. imagine used variants relatively isolated cases couldn’t outcompete dominant mutations (Delta Alpha) still studied science. 

Hoping epidemiologist expert weigh Doesn’t sound catchy. Delta good branding Serious question: people ever going stop panicking this? remain state hysterical fear forever? community Egypt, Turkey, and/or Belgium, probably basically everywhere now. Long term disability. People (or family members) chronic diseases disabilities known years. You’d think pandemic causing millions would open eyes, nope.

I’m sure people also wonder one listens second they’re part group affected. bring positive news, Chairperson South African Medical association stated large majority people infected variant facing mild symptoms.  Pripyat probably closest thing today, that’s pretty eerie. log sounds like agreeing person asking question, then? Thank you.. little late.. over.. I'd rather dead feel pain..

Tetanus shot actually works really well long term, better example might pertussis. (Which component TDAP vaccine, covers tetanus, diphtheria pertussis least get re-upped everything.)

If get puncture type injury they're going give tetanus shot though there's essentially real downside. Unfortunately virus doesn’t give fuck happens comment things don’t fully understand lol like Groundhog Day Death Wack Mole planet wide playing field tiny hammer. Eh, comments breaking news post new variant already goldmine anti-vaxxers, basically cares? They’ve already made minds happened anyway. Thank you! yes, agree. It’s difficult plan seems major decisions change quickly. German friends thought would better vaccine uptake, though obviously wrong. new German government coming also makes things difficult plan for. 6 weeks ago booked seemed like pretty dang good idea! arguing someone unironically posts r/BigFoot don’t know expect. love traveling too.

""could"" hypothetical statement. reality, cannot expected to. money 100% dominating news week now, even days already Nu variant several months ago.

People applying ""Nu"" moniker novel strain now. Well viewed everything new variant thar available yet, cursory glance, spreads really easily greater ability evade immunity. literally always wrong. US wait last minute anything always does. It’s worth “worrying” about. It’s worth taking specific precautions prioritizing investigation of. South Africa regions entirely vaccinated, that’s said cases  Disrespecting Science, nature, ecosystems, climate, other. Best part worse thing far.  love confidence. even December yet.  Moderna create Delta versions realized much need much difference. original vax performed great direct competition Like miracle? I’m trying think previous occasion happened, sure sounds familiar guess taking issue concept saying “most people”...

I don’t think know yet.  

We idea whether vaccines effective betting odds less effective minimum I'm concerned. Companies like BioNTech already working boosters specific new strain. anti-vax probably need frightened this. annoying anything. G-rap yo person came Egypt, blocking flights bunch countries Egypt? use front new variant. Making vaccines mandatory solve issue. fully expect around 10% still not/refuse vaccinate, even making mandatory.

What needs happen refusing hospital &amp; IC care unvaccinated people. Less tho, people grasp this. People still die car crashes seatbelts on, fact car crash deaths seatbelts seatbelts like vaccines decrease risk Also, linear correlation ""more mutations spike protein"" ""more likely evade vaccines""? would biggest concern here. Venting! It’s great fun. appears covid going stay. nastier version flu hope current year's vaccine provide benefit. Oddly, I'm concerned markets reaction, point mostly driven institutional inverters lot inside information things, us don't. There’s familiar ring didn’t originate though could learn lessons  post covid forum you’re confident? Validation? Ah actually following, that's funny tho highly unvaccinated population largely escaped Delta variant.

I thought low amount cases Delta subsiding SA, gave room Nu establish foothold. It’s definitely likely bad day. escalated fast one day Yes course, good point language lol. see that's great name it, ""the Naked Variant"", like it, sounds sexy. Yep. can’t keep shutting air travel host countries every new variant. That’s sustainable, time learn usually spread anyway. need target countries effective vaccine booster program. Unclear yet, amount changes variant may mean current vaccines less effective. think 2-3 weeks away certain initial testing finished agree. acting information gained. would make sense let travelers we’ve seen Delta. Seems like it, given cases spiked there. butts

It’s like common flu point. new variant every year Sounds familiar…   Roll Out!

Ehhh, meant Roll Up! (Your Sleeve) I'm done pandemic. gov'ts cowed bring ban hammer without even properly understand yet, want look like something seem clue. Yeah, mortality rate acceptable nowadays Spanish flu epidemic generally referring four waves trying curb ageing population birth rate falls might something like yes. entirety Yugoslavia vaccinated within weeks. also called world leading experts advice. actually great example deal deadly pandemic. Unlike half world nowadays. Lockdown + distancing + vaccines, yes believe eradicate it. Obviously won’t happen bc people disciplined. Holy hell decision ever made interim time actually matters.  stop stop eat popplers! also encourage countries keep mouth shut future varents [Forced vaccination wipes diseases SCOTUS named Unicron Destroyer Worlds.

The copyright infringement payout would well worth anti-vaxers might actually get dose faced formidably named foe.  Delta ravaged India properly identified. Entire second wave India delta virus care vaccine vaccinated people false sense security. 

This one bullshit. Many specialist doctors kind work make upwards 600k/yr. pay issue. 13 years schooling issue. pretty good checking see huge explosion heard imagination. certain airlines fan either. actually? I’m pretty sure listed VOI website first, though without omicron title. could wrong though! ""direct"" mean nonstop. means flight even goes 5 airports. change planes, sit wait passenger change take again. 

I doubt ever nonstop route South Africa Michigan, way low demand. -no understand , N U

- ?  COVID IFR still around 2-3%, order magnitude smaller smallpox nothing sneeze also. Nah delta overtook lower incubation period. become asymptomatic carrier guy infected becomes ill. 

The way delta worked person infecting B, he's symptomatic. B start infecting shows symptoms. contact tracing became impossible. 

11 day incubation logistical nightmare due quarantine requirements. we’ve learned anything, this. Yes, planes heading one direction, none fly other. indeed ridiculous.

Europe another bad wave, 26 states including northeastern US starting pick up, new strain might vaccine-resistant pops up.

Additionally many people vaccinated due booster.

I would say would enough start worrying future yhe economy vested interest. &amp; B cells still give protection previous infections? unlike vaccines, thought Covid already provides antibodies parts virus, spike protein.

My wife &amp; live Africa. Covid 3 times far. Symptoms like flu 80% O2 levels, otherwise okay. That's understandable also naive LMFAO someone caught it, spreading. fucking much imbecile understand this? People died COVID March. like OOOOH THERE'S SCARY VIRUS THAT'S GONNA MAYBE START KILLING PEOPLE ONE DAY. boom first death. Even that's worked, first person US dying February means spreading point January. mean Jesus fucking Christ.

But yeah definitely right link logical fallacies. logical fallacy can't understand common sense? Right?! Fauci saying evidence it’s US yet like deja vu. much people travel, would weird *weren’t* here. don’t know yet. Give days. Apparently that’s hard lot people, and/or there’s big government conspiracy benefits countries citizens wearing masks???

But yes, wearing mask global pandemic seems pretty freaking obvious. realistically given large parts world cant wont get vaccinated agree  thank you, i've looking comments day

he strong believing delta would final wave data case fatality rate severity symptoms though we? outperforms delta, less severe that's overall beneficial. Obviously need cautious incase ends worse, outcompetes variants make inherently worse. DECIDED? LEAVE HANGING? DAT? Yeah, 3 months basically full wave based we've experienced; I'm also *very* concerned FDA/CDC blowing dragging feet. Consider boosters technically still recommended 50+ despite approval ages, also consider want wait ""more data"" travel freezes; anything, travel freezes face new variant universal targeted specific countries, one gets sense public health officials blanket anti-border-closures. Yes dichotomy. term measured spectrum includes countries like America. I've heard lot speculation due rugby international Twickenham last week England South Africa, could already UK. went back school nursing 2019 spry young age 50. went far LPN 1 year program. 40s would definitely gone RN. advantage older student 1) little kids need mom constantly, 2) better confidence 20s., 3) much better focus study skills younger. really enjoyed school like job (I work home health crazy hospital work). Best luck you. Australian I've surprised strongly state governments fought us useless federal gov wanted nothing. We've mostly covid free except one unfortunate city (which densely populated), recently biggest conservative state tried play chicken virus lost. I'm anything proven work. we've learned anything past 2 years, \*find\* variant, likely everywhere already putting travel bans place theater. Recall US travel ban to/from China 2020. Turns out, whole east coast US already seeded travel to/from Europe despite best efforts. one ready 3 days

ready **for testing** Covid kill otherwise healthy 25 year old fully vaccinated male..

Secondly, think cracking joke someone's misery appropriate, hope realize right.. transmissible definition dangerous. Oh Orson Welles back dead he’s *pissed!* keep thinking Futurama Omecron Persei 8 Yeah, reporter clearly ""not me, I'm special!"" bias going on.

Not really? says don’t actually know it’s dangerous. It’s potentially dangerous. **And I’m favour restrictions buy time figure out, however painful immediate cost others.** also important clear don’t know yet.

As rest linked article follow-up tweets make clear, bias 350 people forced spend 21 hours close inadequately-ventilated proximity one another suspicion carrying dangerous variant, 9 hours tarmac without access clear news plans even fucking food water. 

At least two hours ago hustled onto bus tested, still given anything drink eat. really think mildly objecting experience practical public-health utility treatment amounts ""not me, I'm special!"" bias, know say. Haha--I needed chuckle, thank you! (Pumpkin) Pi Variant.   grew low point Transformers. Sounds like member B2K, Omarion. Delta variant wreeked havoc civilization thought things getting better yet markets drop. less 100 known cases mostly Africa. Seems fishy. true say, women Omicron Persei 7 men Omicron Persei 9. Excited this!  mention Egypt low vaccination rate too, 13.45% population fully vaccinated (source made clinic secretary. That’s hugely insulting RN.    Correct means ""No"" Romanian, would fitting. areas act like pandemic doesn’t mean pandemic still doesn’t exist. Ignorance helps propel longer event us want already happening europe, due omicron due delta wave. includes well vaccinated countries. Paris already wear masks outside, waiting line, every 3rd regular patient cant treated anymore germany, denmark mask mandate again, belgium closing bars clubs, italy enfocring mask mandates again.
CDC recommends even masks vaccinated incidence high.

The idea drop NPIs abysmal vaccination rates outlier here. Good luck dude. Shit gonna rough. Wow.. 😯 companies already started? I'm gonna try get Moderna since that's originally got. 1st one made tired. 2nd tired chills, waking multiple times night. sore arm days. I'm prepared third put day two. does, it. better alternative, covid. searching try understand Nu vs Omicron variant. it’s variant, people thought would named Nu instead named Omicron?   sort fatalism tends support nothing. think worst possible path. Seriously? Lol. Covid Buy semiconductors HODL  Well, hope also see massively oversimplified, true tradeoff different properties virus considering danger. Yep! refreshed, overstaffed healthcare workforce champing bit another year two hospitalizations. can’t deliver vaccine they’ve developing 2 years, they’re going one ready 3 days? Ok. Noncompliance means everyone around gets covid. 

The people holding gun anyone’s head NONCOMPLIANT people dragging situation good Americans actually willing put work (masks, vaccines, distancing) defeat covid.  It’s them. still many countries people want get vaccinated still can’t get access them. self-responsibility made wear masks, distance socially get shots, nothing else. Stop spamming comment. took doses vaccine since second dose lost erection. first, erection thing. 
I desire take third dose want know get erection back. Omivid Remember. spy call decrease infection rate ten fold, 1 spy calls= 1 prayer aswell Covid Max yeah, that's think covid us forever now, hopefully gets less deadly par flu mutations inevitably beat vaccine. Yep, rabies thing past.

/s know fatality rate, true. aside high contagion, bad news far changes spike protein vaccines rely on, well ability bypass part natural immunity. 

It's likely thatll way worse previous variants terms infecting vaccinated people (until specific booster shots deployed, takes time) likely able meaningfully reinfect people already COVID, even recently. 

If meaningfully less dangerous small plus, could still set us back year, entails health economy return normalcy even scenario. even care anymore. please increase hospital capacity start lives again? Please? lurr variant Well, didn’t even know now: pretty sure lot reading this. come? That’s true though, COVID far deadly flu U.S., largely due low vaccination rates. people died COVID 2021 2020 low vaccination rates well relaxed we're unlucky we'll end sounding like Orson Welles. stay-at-home dad, worked school librarian, getting colds flus almost month. Since COVID relatively little exposure people outside home trips store, etc. wife teacher contact students staff day. 99% likely caught coworker.

As smoking, smoked tobacco 10 years, heavy vaper since quitting cigarettes. Maybe helped way? vaped COVID ill effects. seemed soothe throat, actually. People seem pretty worried 87 cases worldwide? 77 South Africa? seems really early us quite worried. get there's worrying things looking there's ton variants time. selfish position take — kills everybody, cares society &amp; economy? Delta far fewer mutations Omicron. current VoC 50 mutations, 30 spike protein alone. Kind first SARS never took off. Higher fatality rate shorter incubation rate symptom set. allowed shorter time spreading detection greater change human behavior due higher probability death one contract it. Also region governments proactive implementing measures curb spread thereby preventing virus spreading regions would unlikely mobilize quickly i.e. US.

This cant ever let early. proactive global vaccination. house isnt fire doesnt mean fire next door wont spread would vested interest helping extinguish even think neighbor able themself. lesser sure, small impact busy places outweighs small inconvenience brings people imo... CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 26, 2021-- Moderna, Inc., (Nasdaq: MRNA) biotechnology company pioneering messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics vaccines, today announced updates strategy address SARS-CoV-2 variants concern, given emergence B.1.1.529 (Omicron) variant. 
 
The recently described Omicron variant includes mutations seen Delta variant believed increase transmissibility mutations seen Beta Delta variants believed promote immune escape. combination mutations represents significant potential risk accelerate waning natural vaccine-induced immunity. booster dose authorized vaccine represents currently available strategy boosting waning immunity. Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA-1273) authorized booster many populations 50 µg dose level. Company working rapidly test ability current vaccine dose neutralize Omicron variant data expected coming weeks. 
 
Since early 2021, Moderna advanced comprehensive strategy anticipate new variants concern. strategy includes three levels response currently authorized 50 µg booster dose mRNA-1273 prove insufficient boost waning immunity Omicron variant. 
 
First, Moderna already tested higher dose booster mRNA-1273 (100 µg) healthy adults. Moderna completed dosing 306 participants safety immunogenicity study high dose (100 µg) booster. 100 µg dose mRNA-1273 also recently studied National Institutes Health (NIH) U.S. generally resulted highest neutralizing titers prior SARS-CoV-2 strains. Moderna working rapidly test sera high dose booster recipients neutralizing assays determine 100 µg dose provides superior neutralizing protection Omicron. 
 
Second, Moderna already studying two multi-valent booster candidates clinic designed anticipate mutations emerged Omicron variant. first candidate (mRNA-1273.211) includes several mutations present Omicron variant also present Beta variant concern1. Company completed dosing potentially pivotal safety immunogenicity study mRNA-1273.211 50 µg (N=300) 100 µg (N=584) dose levels. second multi-valent candidate (mRNA-1273.213) includes many mutations present Omicron variant also present Beta Delta variants2. Company completed dosing 100 µg (N=584) dose level also plans explore 50 µg dose level approximately 584 participants. Moderna rapidly expand testing sera completed ongoing multi-valent booster studies determine multi-valent candidates able provide superior neutralizing protection Omicron. 
 
Third, Moderna rapidly advance Omicron-specific booster candidate (mRNA-1273.529). candidate part Company’s strategy advance variant-specific candidates subset variants significant concern. 2021 already included Beta- Delta-specific boosters. Company repeatedly demonstrated ability advance new candidates clinical testing 60-90 days. 
 
“From beginning, said seek defeat pandemic, imperative proactive virus evolves. mutations Omicron variant concerning several days, moving fast possible execute strategy address variant,” said Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer Moderna. “We three lines defense advancing parallel: already evaluated higher dose booster mRNA-1273 (100 µg), second, already studying two multi-valent booster candidates clinic designed anticipate mutations emerged Omicron variant data expected coming weeks, third, rapidly advancing Omicron-specific booster candidate (mRNA-1273.529).” Omicron sounds like grandma getting high. Megatron?  I'm saying would dominate news months  Pretty sure nations broke news earlier week though. saying guy isn’t reaching, I’m sure there’s behind timing lot politics would think. Oh that's interesting, thanks. happen know immune response ends kicking later case? virus suppressing immune response beginning there's much present unable stop immune response later? It’s zero, it’s easy full immune escape. read study 😆😩 economic interests, human ones (people families outside, know?), scientific cooperation ...

Also, assume scientific cooperation would sharply diminish cut country variants ... Especially since yet know bad.

I know specific reasons had, though. We'll give machines temporary control ... we'll get back drivers seat

I take read watch lot sci-fi? 1 case, soon zero. meant entire world. long entire countries, even continents without vaccines never end. always get lucky virus mutating something harmless Finally opinion changing. high school 2003-2007, way poverty education wanted strike rich take family penury go USA. hard work seen achievement. parents incredibly proud slogged “succeeded”. now, people back home don’t see going USA smartest thing. Lol. So, outside USA, info USA’s incompetence vile coming recently. Thanks trump, huh one Britain signed big contracts fast-tracked approval of?

30% efficacy junk status comes medicine. quote always helps I'm feeling feels especially true COVID.

""It [get worse], get better. get worse again. better. life, lie saying every day sunshine. sunshine again, different thing say. truth. promise you, warm again"".

-- Brandon Sanderson originated Botswana though yet still probably enough. Super serial sources entire comment bullshit. clue they're talking about. They're spreading misinformation enough ignorant people propel top. problem we've seen residues mutated known involved immune escape - happening lower order combinations Alpha bit worse Delta. see even piled top B.1.1.529 occurred naturally, easily infer one worse. higher order combinations mutations selected first place. new genotype now, infinitely easier predict problem 2 years ago even 1 year ago. Million might excessive challenge trials scale. could find plenty willing volunteers $30,000. Imagine thinking vaccine efforts related feelings That's exactly said. like scary words, magic man Yeah folks keep forgetting larger impact hospitals getting slammed. ""Just thought out, pull back in!!!"" new strain roughly 50 mutations total, including 10 receptor binding domain, part virus first comes contact highly contagious delta variant, says accounts 99% world’s Covid cases, two mutations receptor binding domain. Tbh, completely new virus could emerge right square one. Remember quickly vaccines developed, much treatments improved, progress happening monoclonal antibodies therapeutic treatments. Humanity constructed utterly vast pharmaceutical complex exist way back march 2020.

On top that, looks like good news emerging. scary variant, looks present time already (it egypt). Furthermore vaccines completely evaded.

It's perfectly valid feel scared, angry hurt. said, take step back doom pit critically evaluate situation.  Tell immune system patient haha Maybe, also really high viral load, means body troubles keeping virus check. course, luck, means nose affected (as immune response typically weaker), whole body (and feel anything), would problem.  Damn scientists probably also hoarding supply Avocado toast Made best decision data avaialble time. Yep definitely poor choose /s Idk literally. society’s buildings built last 100 years pretty good shape start crumbling. Thanks! wondered that, pills variant-specific. Hope not. fair, ""unhindered incubation"" ""spreading"" facilitates accelerates mutations, yes one tied other. type mentality *exactly* problem. Sadly basically certain. Even 2014 west African Ebola epidemic, conspiracy theories spreading among terrified populace Ebola fake patients simply murdered hospitals doctors, resulting multiple attempts mobs raid Ebola hospitals ""rescue"" inside. great ignorant fuck firing shit begin world rejoiced. Markets half step science politics.  [This Exactly. mean, stock market fell drastically Trump 2016 election, America going fall apart. didn't. stock market reached record highs following weeks months, Trump finally going decent president. wasn't.

The stock marketing good predictor anything itself. data whether variant evades vaccines. cause alarm? Yes. need doom unless get vaccine evasion data. Delta 17 mutations, know. [stockdale comes mind thinking end this. 

“When Collins asked question directly Stockdale, replied, “I never doubted would get out, also would prevail end turn experience defining event life, which, retrospect, would trade.”

Collins followed another question: “Who didn’t make out?”

“The optimists. Oh, ones said, ‘We’re going Christmas.’ Christmas would come, Christmas would go. they’d say, ‘We’re going Easter.’ Easter would come, Easter would go. Thanksgiving, would Christmas again. died broken heart….” Covid airborne. Sadly, people call shots still incentive take care poor. Many billionaires became richer ever 2020-21. call shots. Small prosperous businesses got destroyed real power. continue.  would assume that?

Right straw-manning comment, thats rich. Also, assuming I'm unvaxxed SJW ""shrieking""; none things, even ask. had, would politely said I'm fully vaccinated, opinion matter inquired about, simply asking since made statement first place.

Grow up. whiny pedant situation. 30% reduction symptoms/severity/death still significant enough worth widespread use imo Stock market 1000 points doesn’t mean much used anyway. 10 years ago Neary 10% Dow’s value, it’s 3%. variants viruses less severe. adapt kill hosts maximize spreading survive longer. sure disagreeing original post. took expanding original Yes involves injecting tiny robots make blood unclean. Preventing entering gates heaven also discovered Hong Kong.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Who’s asking features? Yeah, also pressure become deadly. seems like roll dice, hopefully Delta like rolling ""6"" ""3"" covid. never really wrong. Oh we’ll survive. rather, life go on. don’t worry :)

The nihilist says better there’s killer virus mass extinction event. Earth, especially flora fauna, benefit humans hit hard future animals/surviving humans decent destructive. seeing greedy rich aholes building vaults survive, “big “ even  give shit point, let virus refuse take precautions That’s usually goes. market realized release token amount, actually pushed oil prices lol Smallpox eradicated 70s, people well aware masking, vaccination, quarantines could stop literal centuries that. George Washington decided mandatorily mass-inoculate entire army smallpox (crude early vaccination) American Revolutionary War kept killing troops. 

It still horrifying disease end always been, never mutated something mild. finally got Russian Sputnik COVID shot today mean's I, way much effort anxiety got every single major COVID vaccine (Pfizer, J&amp;J, Moderna, Sputnik V, AstraZeneca CoronaVac). feel like finally best place mentally since whole thing started. what's impact person? symptoms bad delta? less delta? hospitalizations. missing key data points. 

Seeing market reaction, slight concern delta happened.

\*then anti-vaxxers happened. New variant exactly need challenge trials , challenge trials start immediately determine variant defeat existing vaccine, pre-existing infection reformulating mrna vax variant effective much

Compensate participant million bucks 

Taking wait collect data approach disasterous ever get truly bad variant Really??? calling emergency meeting. 30 mutations spike protein, Delta 2. Including changes charge, neutralize antibody response. I’d say world worried means. Antivirals much likely keep working vaccines. Given people’s reactions, it’s kind laughable literally know variant spreading relatively quickly around Johannesburg.

Not relatively, also absolutely reports correct. shit go away please Worse case would Antibody-dependent Enhancement (ADE) whatever  look local spread vs pre-existing variants, weighed vaccinations &amp; statistical compliance physical measures.

In short: look good.

I'm serious. Doesnt seem little weird concern new variant coming country 24% vaccination rate? Normally disease become infectious less deadly time. disease want kill host prevent spreading. problem covid tho slow killer. virus ample time spread infected person dies. Obviously soon tell, covid really different breed Well, every transmissible variant also dangerous (but vaccines masked it), I'm really hopeful.

There also reason virus evade immune system better (both natural antibodies), bind stronger ACE2 receptor also enter cells easier (like, stuff really everything) would make illness less severe. Actually, reason symptoms might reduced (in beginning) might immune system simply detect it, damage body even recognized.  rationing care, refusing provide care someone vaccinated. big difference understand, think broadly. 1, 2, 3 data points--it's context. necessarily one few, science work cherry picking small number known exceptions extrapolating there. IQ. choice's living choice make.  Yes makes everyone extremely horny, well that’s porn film would start /s Yea. stock market moves based traders think traders do. Covid won’t even get close us in. much severe pandemics past. worried nukes asteroids tbh. seems like new variant could speed considerably. "
