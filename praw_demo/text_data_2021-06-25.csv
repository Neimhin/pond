""No proof true"" =\= ""it's true"" many people know were. several months watching develop China Iran came US CDC saying fully vaccinated people didn’t wear masks completely reckless. lot people took pandemic over. Good luck getting people put masks back on…   recommendation based entirely erring side caution. know still get it, point think level ""acceptable risk"", interact little kids much. Cases kept falling US even though mask mandates lifted weeks ago.

If I'm honest, still slip environment there's social pressure to, prefer able breathe fresh air wherever possible. ruling out, didn’t work. Spent week Orlando wear mask walking around parks. First time year got cough sore throat. Never again.  I’m safest least effected place planet even first reaction get effed PSA: masks ineffictive preventing spread situations face face conversation. COVID-19 airborne aerosolized particles emitted speak. situation someone speaking face face enclosed environment (like checkout grocery store) mask would help. yes, sometimes never know someone going begin speaking de facto wear mask everywhere go, especially outside, utterly pointless think likely scenario. can’t help wonder US hadn’t disbanded unit monitoring kinds outbreaks embassy China would caught covid time anything it, nothing could done early. Hopefully reduce R value masking means like nasal sprays something like that. US way ahead far global vaccination rates go, global health organization, they’re talking specifically us. 

That said, nobody 12 able get vaccinated yet, fair amount 12-18 year olds aren’t allowed get vaccinated due parents. Delta going _mess_ up, unfortunately.

My first impulse fuck people haven’t gotten vaccinated yet, includes everyone 12, they’re saying delta variant severe effects lot people. I’ve also able cover acne breakouts public haven’t waste money time makeup it.  really bad symptoms first dose much milder Moderna second. That’s fair. won’t ever judge someone wearing mask. don’t think mask mandates social distancing flu season future smell returned fully month two.

You can't 'negotiate' incentives vaccination, need negotiate 4-kilobyte virus simply care. Vaccination necessary, _reducing chances catching deadly virus 90%_ incentive anyone need.

In fact bigger picture keep missing clearly stuck selfish republican mentality people vaccinated, safer are. vaccinated people have, less likely see escape mutant renders vaccines ineffective also lethal, less likely immunocompromised person encounter subsequently develop covid-19. finally fatality rate young middle aged adults quite low, thousands people age groups still died thousands still experiencing sequalae disease.

And yes, know smallpox SARS_CoV-2 different animals bet know eradicating smallpox possible SARS isn't. point remains vaccines work greater good everyone tiny thing like get shot.

The title post saying ""Florida leads nation"" implying worse states. compare states generally consider population differences since large differences. TBH consider ""anxiety"" much ""foresight"". That’s part makes laugh.

We know covid causes medium potentially long term side effects people. literally already know it’s case. people struggling symptoms year infection. don’t know long they’ll last. they’ll get worse time cause issues.

But sure, let’s worry tiny possibility vaccine might cause issues future, despite fact lasting symptoms basically nonexistent vaccine. awful lot misinformation circulating certainly looks like deliberate disinformation. 

Disinformation sense misinformation deliberately spread intent causing desired result. taking it: Remote West Texas COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy plain see""  Isn’t Missouri one places people refusing get vaccinated, they’re like 38% fully vaccinated states reaching 50% higher? 

I’m saying don’t take precautions, feel need stay safe, don’t think state like Missouri, Georgia, Indiana good indicator “a storm coming”, since main problem people rolling sleeves.   feel you, coming Oregon, plenty troglodytes preaching Great Denial, Florida seemingly gone way show 49 states r/nextfuckinglevel dumbfuckery, Governor way line.

I feel million sane people there, totally sympathy. Summer worse south last year, possibly people inside together winter. Florida managed kill 2 people send 4 others hospital one little outbreak last week. one didn’t get sick entire group vaccinated.

Just anecdotal example still good number hosts new variant.   know infect others too. also effects. Plus, take risk death? many questions ponder.

In practice, loads potential problems approach end much reduced amount mRNA/DNA translated, therefore less spike protein, therefore less immune reaction. example, mRNA quite short-lived (one reason crazy temperatures store start) may degrade chance translated, side fence, good fraction adenovirus carrier AZ/J&amp;J/Sputnik intercepted immune system DNA cargo destroyed gets chance translated.

Each vaccines tries different tricks address issue, *I think*, Modernal Pfizer slightly different backbone mRNA, Modernal advices something like 5x copies per dose Pfizer, Sputnik uses two different adenovirus body attack easily second shot, J&amp;J decided gamble single shot good enough, probably suspected second might make much difference this, however AZ two shots exactly stuff definitely improve results (tough long wait probably helps). new thing, they've basically led country months one paying attention many street would newsworthy.

Plus took extreme measures realized leaked virus lab. quick note- actually common mathematical misconception vaccines. estimated 94-95% effective vs unvaccinated person. 

The difference is, everyone exposed COVID infected. latest estimates secondary household attack rates around 17%. So, 2000 unvaccinated people exposed spouse, average 340 infected. 

However, vaccines tested baseline. vaccine 95% effective preventing those- 340 potential infections, 17 people infected. Sorry it’s convoluted.  


(Note: estimated household attack rate, actual attack rate still TBD. using numbers illustration math works). also suppose enough doses stock vaccinate 75% 12+ pop 2nd dose end next week. matter getting arms point. see cases plateau awhile get everyone done cant imagine another wave point. efficacy give relative performance? 2000 people exposed = 100 cases 2000 people * odds unvaccinated person gets covid given exposure * (1 - efficacy rate). misunderstood? know it’s much people participated trials counted well?

Get vaccines people! keep saying .2% people get COVID die...so virtually insignificant.  vaccine database reports 4000 deaths following vaccination. CDC’s obscure “garbage bin” death category “Symptoms, signs, abnormal clinical laboratory findings, elsewhere classified” shot lock step vaccination rates (and far years prior), reports 20,000 excess deaths.

Absolutely. vaccines WORK. needs remembered, shouted rooftops- thanks antivaxxers.

But also little early get complacent. mutant varieties (some vaccines less effective against: even resistant variations may form future...) one reason states hurry remove mask restrictions- especially given ENORMOUS economic costs surge new, mutant variant leads another shutdown...

More masks means fewer new cases. Fewer cases means less chance new mutant variety forming, surviving past first cases simple chance could wipe (if infected person 40% odds infecting nobody, 30% infecting one person, 25% infecting 2 more, 5% odds super-spreader..  still nonnegligible odds new variant dying cases still single digits...) least could reference conspiracy theory page without saying merit. Yeah games going shit show super spreading event.  stop panicking variants unless want restrictions forever. Vaccines worked well variants far, reason believe case one. Thanks, know overlooked reading that. Wow, they're really implementing lot. Hopefully reserving possibility things, depending data looks fall? things going well reduce restrictions. Easier away implement expected.  “Majority” seems vastly understate it. I’m reading correctly, 95% cases people completely unvaccinated.  vaccines make likely symptoms mild, likely contribute community spread.

Many vaccinated Brussels. vaccination status based place residency, people accounted people vaccinated Flanders Wallonia. three weeks ago, number vaccinations Brussels, people living outside Brussels estimated around 130 000. time, 600 000 total shots counted Brussels resident, offset due 130 000 unaccounted shots made difference.

Each region allocated vaccination doses according population, vaccinating similar rate. almost doses lost, really conclude Brussels vaccinating slower regions.

Another minor thing, many people living Brussels nationals countries. also fact people got vaccinated country, counted ""vaccinated"" belgian administration, people end counted unvaccinated residents. (This case, french national, could get vaccinated earlier Brussels, many us took 30min trip Lille got jabs).

I heard fact Brussels younger population rest Belgium also lead people Wallonia Flanders falsify proof residency order get appointment vaccination Brussels, vaccination opened younger age classes way earlier Brussels regions. would counted vaccinated Flanders Wallonia well. 

There another minor effect, seems people Brussels less responsive preventive health campaign regions, general trend. That's something observed looking cancer screening campaign such, also third population registered general practitioner (so less likely informed vaccination campaign), lot regions.

In end, Brussels's number lot behind regions, due lack vaccination, vaccination rate slower. mainly lot people vaccinated Brussels counted vaccinated people Fladers Wallonia gonna lie seen babydog bottom heart melted little bit. wants fellow west Virginian's get vaccinated, understand that. TAIPEI, June 26 (Reuters) - Taiwan reported first domestically transmitted case highly contagious Delta variant coronavirus Saturday, tightening controls southern part island cases occurred.

Taiwan battling cluster domestic infections, almost due previously globally dominant Alpha variant, though numbers steadying outbreak comparatively small.

Six people Pingtung county confirmed Delta variant, including two returned month Peru, suspected bringing infection from, said Health Minister Chen Shih-chung.

One classified domestic infection, rather within family arrived Peru.

The government carrying mass testing area cases reported, quarantining suspected contacts. ordered supermarkets, restaurants wet markets closed three days, Chen said.

""Now entered community, proactively working contain it,"" said.
Taiwan previously reported five cases, imported, Delta variant, first detected India.

From Sunday, government tighten border controls keep variant, requiring arrivals five countries, including Britain, placed centralised quarantine facilities.

The broader picture Taiwan's COVID-19 outbreak continues improve, Chen announcing 78 new cases, slightly 76 previous day, though controls gatherings public events remain place.

Taiwan's tally infections stands 14,545 since pandemic began, including 623 deaths.

Reporting Ben Blanchard; Editing Kenneth Maxwell collapsed buildings  fully vaccinated wearing mask feels great. Following WHO's advice want variants evolve/spread. Better safe sorry mean will. requirement jobs, longer covid lingers widespread become. Hey, least get haircut. look homeless nearly cried allowed go back Canadian Tire.

..why yes I'm Ontario, know? gives odds roughly 1 257,000 dying covid vaccinated, 1 47,000 infection.

your roughly estimated odds covid risk without vaccination 1 300 die, 1 10 infected.

so far vaccine cutting odds death nearly 99.9% odds infected 99.98% *laughs maniacally Tennessee*

We're Number 47, baby - 34.72% fully vaccinated here. Taipei, June 26 (CNA) Taiwan Saturday reported 80 new cases COVID-19, two domestic infections, well 13 deaths disease, according Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

(By Ko Lin)  12 headline due reporting new cases. NSW counts day 8pm-8pm, that's 29 are. However, today also telling cases found 8pm whenever press conference (usually ~11am). 

So would say NSW X amount cases 24 hours 8pm 8pm, also since 8pm, reported. Resulted news reporting 29-17(yesterday's Y)= 12 new cases. Congrats, that's stupidest thing I've read reddit today, far. confirm appear happens frequently reported. second Pfizer shot heart rate 10-15 points higher usual.

No, started use greek letters ""L"", like Delta ""D"" almost every person see Reddit saying “reinfected” 2 positive tests least 3 months later. It’s always “Well symptoms first time know got 8 months later test positive.” 

Reinfections still seem pretty rare didn’t test positive twice 3 months apart, don’t buy reinfected. Yeah, CDC claimed masks useless... remember Woah. Even worse. Thanks replying. realize many people country, right? one gonna live forever, number insignificant. That's weird process, whatever works! Almost 1/3 population vaccinated creators say protection 100%.

Source that? could find say 100% anti-body formation (which mean protection). However, flat ""100%"" claim sort highly dubious treated least spoon salt. I'm getting Pfizer shot next week top J&amp;J got back March Like H1N1 ...it never disappeared, reclassified yet another strain flu totally agree. articles one agenda it’s scare people rushed decisions divide grift continue. nothing positive coming MSM positive bringing money views, let’s bombard everybody Giga-Uber-Delta-Bravo-Omega variant keep people terrified. True, think main reason behind decision people can't sue them. people take vaccine get described side effects, basically fault, since knew could happen. reason J&amp;J would never work zero-covid country main protection severe disease death. That's great countries world sizable outbreaks jabs protect health system collapse stop deaths. 

But zero-covid countries populace accept risk even mild illness currently live totally normal lives 99% time border closed. vaccine able really prevent even mild symptoms infection actually allow us open borders, point vaccination here. Vaccinate everyone J&amp;J people would still demand borders stay tightly closed. 

Also J&amp;J AZ come blood clot risk, low, still hard justify next risk actually catching Covid community here. leads much vaccine hesitancy we'd never get herd immunity. 

Thus Pfizer Moderna real choices zero-covid countries. I'm risking getting second dose Pfizer next week. fully vaccinated wearing mask feels really great. thankful live northeast US. swear people paid much attention numbers traffic accidents vaccine side effects, car usage would plummet 98%. number folks act vaccines coin toss yet happily pop car drive 10-15mph speed limit weaving traffic freeway shows bad people risk assessment. Get vaccinated get chance. Hopefully supply mRNA vaccines go soon.

Quarantine 100% effective continue occur.  Australian quarantine system 100% effective. FTFY.

You cannot catch virus come contact it. predictable like that, people side effects second dose. reluctance 3 Aussies vaccine hesitant, reasons mainly connected zero covid policies I'm sure safe considered pissing one's pants. It'll years feel comfortable going something like concert county fair whole bunch people shoulder-to-shoulder me. seem miss third group group wants get everything back way even means bunch idiots children immunocompromised people going die. What's big deal wearing fucking mask trying stay distant people familiar with? even said may need third, booster shot end year. (Said recently Dr Norman Swan Australia's ABC radio podcast Coronacast.) may subject type vaccine effectiveness, course. don’t people say “covid leaving people permanently disabled” euphemisms like “long covid”  got first shot side effects hearing second shot much worse admit I’m looking forward pretty nervous honest I’ll still Yes, course. Also, allergies.  live NJ, 100-300 cases day 1 month (for us good metrics). 100-300 cases day growth rate flat. one single person virus Australia lead dozens infected new lockdowns implemented? vaccinated?  Guh heart hurts lost lot credibility pandemic. Best check sources. No, main thing many young immunocompromised get hurt. every time get vaccine even though I'm anxious. always sit 15 minutes sip glass water. never problems faintings except getting vaccinated. guess subconcious reaction  Goodness, morning.

Feeling scared? Everything okay, make sure family vaccinated.

We're still seeing worrying numbers symptomatic breakthrough infections, even Delta. Especially Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J.

When start see worrying trends, hear it.  I’d also like point year ago, kept hearing efficacy 60s original strain (matching benchmark set flu vaccine) would great, 88% variant didn’t exist vaccines developed nothing short amazing.  That's stupid.Delta variant affects younger people too.

(Here younger people yet able vaccinated,to get one :()Here young generation dying.In US too.

Unless tell straight isn’t effective new variant, wouldn’t worry. Stating obvious never vaccinate entire world. countries alternative vaccines fall back restricted AZ. Australia not, hence opted remain essentially unvaccinated Q4 avoid small number extremely rare side effects.

This thing sits front mouth eight hours EVERY DAY. It’s gross underwear.  NZ may better handle this. Australia think stuck limbo. Lmao cases low. Get alarmist headline.  It’s double positive samples sequenced. may even know. Friday, delta variant first devastated India spreading globally -- thought 60% transmissible first widely tracked contagious variant emerged U.K. last year -- accounts 10.3% citywide samples tested last four weeks. That's 5.6% city officials' previous report 4.9% health department report relatively minute subset positive samples genetically sequenced assess potential strain variations, CDC local New York City experts believe prevalence delta significantly higher reported. love see US this.

Their population roughly 1000x smaller us. interesting. husband one family got sick Covid chronic Candida issues. immune response Covid ended curing Candida. wonder reason ill 6 weeks.  Kong.

That's single jurisdiction. Singapore strategy trouble vaccinating. reluctance Australia.

Because they've access thus far AZ, limited 60+ major bad press around blood clot issue. everyone Australia knows govt ordered millions Pfizer doses later year there's incentive wait better vaccine. 

In NZ getting 100% Pfizer incentive wait people keen since know best. heard bed capacity issues surely solution expand capacity rather make travel difficult 2+ years more?

There's bed capacity issue NZ. deliberately keep bed numbers low limit daily arrivals NZ average 1 quarantine leak community every 200 positive cases quarantine. beds means leaks increased risk outbreak lockdown. 

NZ issue thousands citizens trapped overseas like Australia though. Kiwis able fly NZ without much difficulty whole pandemic. also ban people going overseas way Australia does. 

In long term hotel quarantine people coming red zone countries. Right whole world red zoned (we moved Australia back red zone tonight due outbreaks), time list shrink. can't start sometime 2022 we've finished vaccinations. would expect able visit US Europe summer 2022. Africa, Brazil India still probably limits 2023.   don’t really know “bleedy” edge means exactly one viral vector vaccine approved fda (for ebola) occrured December 2019. Two viral vector vaccines approved EU. ebola, one fda approved one (EU approved November 2019) different one (approved July 2020). That’s exactly “tried true” indeed different technology “traditional” vaccines.

Get now?

We really need cases halted vaccines. don’t could devastating effects unvaccinated risk even worse mutations. know, govt giving specific numbers. say roadmap work progress specific details released due time.  also received J&amp;J shot (in U.S.) thinking getting Pfizer shot help delta variant. planning getting one shot Pfizer?  Glad we're finally seeing study like this. Previously people insisted mild infections really get long term side effects high rates. Kati Kariko get Nobel prize really damn soon I'm going riot.  Yes. many people think 95% efficacy means 5% chance getting Covid. Moderna Pfizer trials, like .04%.  Wow. Come Chile.

Two-thirds would ballpark herd immunity we're talking original strain. Delta would require much higher vax rate. Florida daily cases California. Florida also isn’t reporting cases non-residents. It’s worth noting meaningless 11,000 plus people got infected lost year.  fuck news?!

A lot dummies think danger over.

So news still get sick never said Delta variant articles. state cases per capita. hearing long time. fall conspiracy bullshit. Cases double among WHO??

Presumably unvaccinated people would nice clearly state that. Work reading comprehension skills try again. 

This isn’t first time you’ve done highly doubt last  evidence that? I've heard lot vaccine hesitancy Japan, zero-covid country. got Taiwan get vaccines political reasons, Vietnam able afford Australia NZ purchased yet doses delivered. None us even chance vaccine hesitancy issue.

I hate this. 

Lots stuff happen
 
Yes, vaccinated people get sick exposed new variants, tell us odds make decision Probably even 10% months. compared efficacy vaccines virus make point vaccines 100%. way claim two viruses same.  First step wear mask nose. Everything chemicals. flu shot cannot protect every strain flu. Even get sickened flu time spent sick recovering far shorter. 

Also, like bad cold [eat bowl chicken noodle Odd. English parliament. Spot  assume mean CDC? lot good work, often political perfect. Pfizer, first shot, sore arm day, 2nd shot, slightly sore arm it.

My wife side effects yearly flu shot, first shot, sore arm, 2nd shot, felt crappy day fine. much want tribulation over, virus may ideas. wishful thinking amplify epidemiological spread. people government never take covid seriously. situation close India. fuckin hell Australia also significantly fewer people immunity. NYC 1 million cases city 8 million people. That’s lot people naturally acquired antibodies. top that, 50% fully vaccinated almost 60% partially vaccinated. 

No one doubts delta contagious, Australia isn’t environment US aren’t many places virus go. significantly fewer people naturally acquired antibodies vaccinated population lower. God! Insurrection!!!! Everyone goes jail! Yeah, redditors thread convinced get tested. I’m heading couple hours test. hell it, I’ll post back edit results. wear mask everywhere go. socially distance. I’m fearful people vaccination carriers know it. happened pass covid somebody would definitely sympathy would hope gave me, would also show sympathy return. 

We’re human. There’s much hate world. lack sympathy towards one another issue day age.

I love everybody. Unfortunately everybody loves me. respect beliefs feelings. Unfortunately everybody respects mine. Uh, no. 750 people fully vaccinated died US COVID far, it’s definitely happening. Delta common variant US, like everywhere else, expect see number course RCT gold standard, mean ignore types studies. One thing J&amp;J seems get better time, specifically hospitalization death. even RCT, specifically test severe/critical cases. several endpoints looked severe/critical efficacy 2 weeks 4 weeks 3 locations. trial much rigorous think. someone loves cook, loss would hell me. long protected u got ur 2 shots planning getting tested?
I wonder many cases going unreported people mild symptoms aren’t getting tested. respiratory infection description since 2013. Work retail behind register think 2-3 respiratory infections year last 30 years till 2013 means immune nearly myriad cold causing Rino/Adeno/Corona Viruses point. Probably primed immune system make SarsCov2 asymptomatic assuming caught sometime last 16 months. Im glad vaccine works intended. gives peace mind. still masked tho. Thank spreading easily preventable viruses! I’m waiting Wyoming get absolutely hammered. vaccinated still overly cautious wearing masks grocery stores... even I'm wondering point wearing mask dine-in restaurant bar? Movie theater get least. still 90% efficacy range delta variant. Uncontrolled, anecdotal data. controlled study done delta symptoms differ ancestral variants. Like no, especially given prevalence seasonal allergies right now.  reduce chances 70-90%? still wear mask indoors around people (even though I’m fully vaccinated). Unfortunately usually person (Ohio). UK wide spaces vaccine doses appears boost efficacy. That’s it. Thanks clarification Overall? US rate 2.1%, talking 600,000 dead vs 150,000 0.4%. world's roughly 2.2.% likely underestimates. mean, go complain founding fathers. nature country freedom right absolute. version freedom compared literal monarchy. freedom allowing white, land owning males vote, still even vote directly president.

I'm sure mean ""go you"" supposed mean. ones trying hold vaccination face pandemic. antivaxxers trying drag us them. vaccination real past cases = zero people antibodies.  good information that, though.

The solid data symptomatic COVID, that's trials designed study. gold-standard, double blinded placebo-controlled studies. 

Every piece data pretty flawed. know vaccines help great deal severe cases, much. clinical trials thinking outside regulatory box. Uk took huge risk, could turned quite different. Vaccine impeccable safety profiles dose hundreds millions healthy people.

I'm getting 雞排 still can. period key die? depends vaccination rate state. regions literally reach herd immunity future outbreaks fall localized. places like Missouri ground zero superspreader holiday gatherings, they're denial contagious new mutations are. never got rid masks knew this.

Disagree. everyone wants vaccine get one, that's good gonna get. covid still around, it. ain't wearing mask rest life. Can’t wait Delta Mini discount.  Apologies wrong sub ask question, guidance vaccinated people around vaccinated people lower functioning immune systems?

My husband live NYC. mild COVID cases earlier year since gotten fully vaccinated Pfizer recovery. We’re visiting family next month Arkansas vaccination rate abysmally low (28% population one dose). family members also fully vaxed; however, several 65 years old fairly recent stage IV cancer survivors (remission &lt; 2 years).

My husband concerned we’ll expose family COVID somehow bring along variant Arkansas NYC. COVID cases rise Arkansas Delta variant making way state. course, we’re also concerned Arkansans could responsible spreading COVID family given low vaccination rate. guidance approach situation? Thanks advance! Sick reading stupid comments open everything let unvaccinated people get it. It’s like think virus magically disappear that. 

The longer virus around mutations changes one avoid vaccine. Masks limit spread even within unvaccinated vaccinated community virus spreads less hosts slow spread would less time mutate. Masks blocks droplets aerosols leaving carrier, without leaving carrier less people gets infected.

But fucking vaccinated makes wearing mask like swallow fucking dog shit something. Stuff stay open, wear fucking mask slows spread. Same. vaccinated, wasn’t choice vaccine could get. tried several times get Pfizer Moderna, J&amp;J one could get appointment for. guess I’ll wait see whether get booster offered.

Breakthrough cases places selective pressure virus mutate vaccine evasive variants. Sounds like brilliant government spin royally screwing vaccine procurement. Happens literally every cold ever had. Also lost sense taste smell back December Covid. It’s almost back (I hope). Welcome dark side, bud, we’ll get it. 8.8 million first shots, 5.5 million second shots. Total 14.3 million shots Tuesday, although currently nearing 15 million count last night.

Population: 17.3 million

So half entire population first, 30% second. total 85/100 accounting severe/critical protection near 100% though. means downplayer, really matter lot people get covid they're asymptomatic mild cases. effectively becomes regular cold then. 

Also, 64% specifically regards B.1.
351 (SA variant). Fortunately, variant seem gain much ground anywhere. got really lucky evasive variant sucks spreading lol. said previous comment, according real world US data, J&amp;J 77% effective (not symptomatic) infection, that's two weeks.  think surely meant helps correct misestimations... help prevent public policy maker adopting uncredible strategies pretend protecting unvaccinated... takes years feel comfortable go crowded event again, bigger problems. Delta serious business, especially zero Covid country. supposed to, sad part. Like every job ever worked out, rules specifically stated feel good stay home. Like almost none actually practiced though.

Seriously though, Delta variant rise I'd keep track news, strap one mask starts getting risky again. 

Love downvotes too, keep salty ya'll.  95% times works every time pummel death solid objects like rocks river. hurt, buy argument. people always going big bad gubmint waiting rubber stamp shot? Yeah.

[Data like kind would keep checking sense smell still every 15 minutes method.   95% 1919 pandemic like 18 months...this little 12 months now...there still 6 months go. next winter....people would either gotten virus then, vaxxed...right many refusing get vaxxed...will get immunity natural way, yet. (hopefilly chose get vaxxed likely gonna enough herd immunity fall/winter.) 

Point is...yea, things get better, another 6 months mostly mask use. That's long 1919 one lasted...its yet CDC screwed dropped soon political reasons. (to encourage vaccations ""reward"" wear mask, well...with delta variant fine, but....now delta new science going work now.)

So...yea, things get better, yet, nearly bad fall/winter vaxxed. acknowledge fearmongering without touching conspiracy theories. None players (governments, NGOs, politicians, scientists, even journalists) sufficient incentive honest public. We’re pawns hundreds proxy conflicts. 

Being properly informed never difficult. understand people would give up. years Sweden best Europe gym never closed pandemic. Red Cross cal announced won’t testing antibodies much longer. blood donation critical need right win win donate soon. COVID could knock ass lot longer three days. Maybe forever. might wanna get secondary doctors opinion allergic every kind covid vaccine, ingredients differ greatly. Starts take said pre-pandemic. People acting like it’s big deal (a bad flu). warning us it, people ignoring them. then…shit got real. 

I’m saying it’s going happen. points people acting like it’s big deal likely wrong, reassuring, we’ve seen before. people wrong right. I’m cancer survivor national org cancer paid two antibody tests far. excluded vaccine trials far blood cancer patients survivors antibody issues. far I’ve tested positive antibody production times antibodies 3 months dropped significantly better many survivors support group. assume we’ll invited boosters based results there’s t-cell study coming may invited to. definitely helps make better choices. stay hospital week unrelated cancer Covid surgeries knowing vaccinated antibodies meant feeling safe enough procedures done. Soooooooo we're stuck lock-down nightmare forever then? Wth? It’s effective novavax evasive SA variant better AZ vaccine.  Yup. 

We Covid March health ministry let get vaccinated 3 months getting sick. last month also want vaccinate pregnant women. I've thinking getting postpartum since antibodies long now, Delta worried. 

Will probably count tested case. someone living one states terrible vaccination rate I’m putting mask back delta variant. got vaccine for. % fully vaccinated much higher 50-59 compared 60-69? Yes better nothing lot exposure time well. part feel quite ready dine inside restaurant yet especially since EVERYONE wants right everything opens back up.   Better immune response, though, IIRC.  happen? state less 30 people hospital week used well 1,000 dropped mask rule quickly CDC announcement. Several days zero deaths, lot days deaths reporting backlog deaths occurred back. QOL improved significantly since normalcy resumed, I’m sure there’s rational reason support mask fall numbers like this. US would good plan, focus getting every vaccinated, I'm sure enough man power take that. piece:
*Some* may get sick, badly long.

Get vaccinated. We're approaching 70 percent; herd immunity within reach.  absolutely infuriating watching local news reporting cases. ""Man catches covid despite vaccinated!!!""
sends dangerous message people fence vaccines ineffective, truth. 

And stories saw actually tie back efficacy clarify hey, 95% 100%, 5% 300 million Americans still *lot* people. FDA recommend give people false sense security. That's state state thing. much crippling society, protecting getting sick.

Now know respiratory viruses actually aerosolized spread primarily via air, droplets, even without covid idea entering spaces without mask absurd. Even flu joke, knew know I'd masking spaces years ago. Well, think need go get Covid test  want know happens us cannot get vaccinated allergy? previous vaccine allergy can’t take Covid vaccine. That’s fault yet can’t enter certain businesses medical condition prevents vaccination? could also considered disability discrimination. Businesses need think liability put place. thing religious exemption, discrimination based religion, raising bar lawsuits. understand requiring unvaccinated people wear mask always comply don’t make pariah allergy vaccine  Good! Maybe slightly less still 90%+ hospitlization death. 

Let's say usually 10 deaths among non-elderly accompanied 100 deaths among elderly - i.e. 90% deaths among elderly. vaccinate elderly, every 10 deaths among unvaccinated non elderly see 4 among vaccinated elderly. 

30% deaths among vaccinated! work! That's comment trying claim.

Thanks punishing sick, work. praising treating us well literally last week. honestly bs lol. german beer hall-style restaurant Alpenhaus located outside arena. Swedish supporters also gather together matches, year world cup 2018.

Here film look see film 2018 looked similar time.

Many supporters quite young ago yet vaccinated. Send superspreader delta variant shout cheer together rest...

I 2018 tickets time decided go. couple friends went anyhow home worried got infected. 50's vaccinated fortunately.  Why? state mask month point week less 30 people hospital Covid past Winter well 1,000. Several days zero deaths. I’d say denying normal life cruel numbers, we’re not, normal life vaccines Covid isn’t crippling us anymore. asking long lasts long starts take effect? *that's* mean cleaving. go. bad news waiting for.

I trying warn people months feared Delta variant virus would dangerous world fast able spread.

Again, HATE right. started wearing masks fire season couple years ago, transition fairly easy zero problem wearing one need feeling like trash cold. corporate ass nuggets tax hungry city governments want ass back office, whatever CDC says won’t mean shit. I’m confused onto exactly wanted different think exit strategy resuming old normal life been. So....I gotta say, fact Loki came new variants making news lot hilarious. Thank goodness. Care homes need same. Nowhere mention two key findings UK: Pfizer prevents 88% infections 96% hospitalizations. Cases could rise, yes, vaccines 100% lots unvaccinated people.

Israel seen local outbreaks Delta remains seen progeesses. UK situation different US, since Delta showed virtually vaccination 45. US high vaccination rates among age groups (in certain states) help control spread. really feeling way, abandon sub. going read rational takes properly framed data. Yeah, maybe! never thought pets animals. read, US, already gave animals zoos Pfizer vaccine. Maybe ask Pfizer vaccine cat vet safe? wear multiple masks, wear N95 equivalent, they're cheap widely available point protect better double masking. According analysis PHE, Pfizer/BioNTech jab linked 94% vaccine effectiveness hospital admission Delta variant one dose 96% two doses, figures Oxford/AstraZeneca jab 71% 92% respectively.  donate Red Cross, similar experience, listed first post-vaccine donation ""REACTIVE."" means that, exposed first COVID tests, blood responded. However, *didn't* respond blood would someone COVID.

I can't express peace mind get free-with-donation COVID test every two months pandemic. validated taking precautions well helped others. One thing get people care much people decide use masks regardless vaccination status? personal freedom important case?  Folks, know someone got covid NYC. went India got sick again. guess odds high Delta variant (when India). never got vaccinated. even covid counting antibodies seem like good. need get vaccinated. Awesome, thank you! unusual even regular respiratory virus make lose sense smell. Letting portion population suffer get variants. Eventually we'll get variant vaccines stop we're back start.  good idea get flu shot every season hope enjoy pushing agenda.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s totally false though. deaths rising it’s uncoupled cases? Use head. stopped testing donations yesterday bad. mean lump introverts together. I'm fucking tired wearing masks too. get rid mask when? really isn’t going get much better now.  understand disappointment. vaccine ever touted 100 percent effective? Even 98 percent effectiveness means vaccinated people get COVID. also reduces severity many people even symptoms. people still get sick, still symptoms. That's nature pathogens, metric, vaccine insanely good. Especially pharmacy ER, literally 100% chance you’re exposed. defeat purpose though? still highly susceptible others restaurant vaccinated, using masks, talking (creating aerosols), etc. Assume sarcastic. ""5% death outcome"" worry vaccinated? talking 5% ICU admissions, something vaccinated people worry about. I'm anti-mask got first shot 2 weeks ago. variants show current vaccines atleast keep people hospital see problem. delta infections UK hospitalized.  
Of 806 people infected Delta variant ended hospital England 1 February 14 June 2021:As 14 June, 73 deaths 
England people confirmed Delta variant died within 28 days positive test, these:

When read article, says 800 delta infections regardless vaccination status. point thread guidance vaccinated people mask.

Following number says 84 people UK fully vaccinated ended hospitalized. That's order magnitude less. deceive people.

I'd still like see data contextualizing 84 - demographics, comparisons viruses, etc. How’s Tuesday? Grow up. 

I don’t help kids, either. still got doses. I’m selfish child types paragraphs-worth pathetic excuses Reddit. don’t think it’s mind boggling that. wasn’t crippling society like Covid vaccines. May take lot longer go indoor dining anywhere, especially considering many nonvaccinated folks taking absolutely precautions. really sucks, cannot take (some medical condition &lt; 12), really seem care others (or matter).  Thankfully, SoCal lot outdoor options year round.  even true. would sick dozens times year spread reinfected symptomatically. Infection confer advantages. obtuse. Yep state DHEC several test locations area. dumb post. wear KN95s NEVER problem. Can’t wait people say Covid-19 since 80s-90s now. seen anyone thinks 100% back square 1. Even vaccines become less effective disease, still prevent bulk hospitalizations deaths. also proven vaccine technology, could adapt vaccines needed. 

It likely worst pandemic behind us. That's say get bad (it could) unlikely back square 1. novavax coming by? Everything chemicals long there's reservoir virus sustain with, always give opportunity change evolve. That's kind flu common days. 

On top that, people vaccinated COVID also essentially free real estate mutant forms virus antibodies can't difficulties attach to. always evolutionary pressure anything DNA RNA adapt, whether become extinct something science cannot guarantee. long improve infect one person 100 1,000 vaccinated people, really end it. vaccine guarantee infected, eventually spread adapt. People always say herd immunity eventually happen, works infectious agent never changes. fucking shit Sherlock brother developed 20s random illness. remember huge non-issue resolved within 2 weeks. 

This nothing yet another anti-vaxx dog whistle. Generally speaking sick people (immune system anemic) can’t donate blood. free test would great everyone access. Unless 12. chemo treatments. autoimmune issues. cares anyway.

Oh wait, me. Seriously? read post? Masks mandate means unvaccinated people can’t lie vaccinated ditch mask, lead less spreading, less spreading leads less mutations, less mutations leads lower chances mutation avoid vaccine endanger us all. 

To prevent start beginning letting virus spread masking up. safest method smelling coffee grounds.  Anyone 40 eligible while, getting vaccinated sounds like dragging heels one reason another. safe vaccinated people use ivermectin? They’ve using Mexico numbers going down. [Mexico started implementing emergency running oxygen covid patients ended good far, 15 months since 1st US shutdowns, 18 months since 1st cases popped China. Oh, totally agree probably Delta. test sequenced, willing bet Delta. far know, very, mildly sick, yes, vaccine seems protected anything bad happening. wished could enjoyed summer little longer without personally knowing someone breakthrough case.

Bc dominant Delta becomes, breakthrough cases be. And, psychologically, needed bit break, know? early symptoms Delta variant pretty much “common cold” Herd immunity comes everyone either vaccinated caught disease. Historically latter case ended pandemics.  right... lived area tornado danger, I'm still going leave house point. 

Another year like last one worth me. I'll take small risk, like whenever travel, hike, ect.  People want risk unlucky. Texas meet shortly.

Delta doubled recently.

Fourth July celebrations, 1 month total schools college openings legal way enforce safety. (I serious, passed law carry concealed weapons legally, passed laws prohibit schools requiring masks, etc.)

Our vax super low, lowest age groups.

“What’s big deal wearing mask 20 minutes grocery store?”

It’s not. wearing mask ten hour shift housekeeper sucks significantly more. Counterpoint: wife traveled FL visit parents son first time year half, still wore masks close contact others indoors. also actively avoided indoor areas would lots people, exception visiting space center (which required masks guests however, so, big deal us). 

None us got sick, again, we're still cautious although bit less vaccinated. Oh god. actually think make sense! Incredible! Yeah biggest risk *there still pandemic*. solid data coronavirus vaccine immunity lasts longer year. India, China, Africa, South America get 70% vaccinated within year, there's chance another wave spreading US. Funding  Sure, pretty good chance it, certainly gotten sick following trip CVS 0.01% time. idea 100% exposed infectious disease whenever leave house paranoia. nothing like good stabbing boost immune system!  would beg differ, vaccinate, easily test people. simply [finger ""smart folks"" medical community dumb lazy paid pharma figure out. people live freaking jungle. would like nationwide vaccine mandate. can’t whole economy held hostage selfish crazy people. issue hbv vaxx. helping paranoia Pfizer shot take, since had...1 side effect day.

If could get titer something would fab Yep, boat here. feel though lot people still encouraging masks ones wore 20 minutes twice week went grocery shopping. 

I'm fully vaccinated told multiple public health authorities longer need mask. I'm good. Yes, percentages still actual numbers units. 1000 samples, 150 samples, 10,500?? fact list sample size tells pretty low purposefully left look underwhelming. lazy journalist, pretty common days. No, someone gets covid go home quarantined, working even mask. I’m planning wearing kn95 mask public transit crowds indefinitely. Wearing mask easy. sick awful. Autoimmune diseases 🤷‍♀️ huge task likelihood possible. im mistaken, smallpox disease effectively eradicated. saying cant try, dont see working That's case counts still important, area went 300 day average last month 80 month, back 100. case count reducing means less risk. like political stance.

I'll accept - lot data go yet wave, data models R etc inherently exponential Astrazeneca behave shady manner, treats everyone else contempt. communication efforts laughable best. lie try twist turn half-truths, people begin mistrust and, extension, vaccine (which actually solid). AZ took Oxford University's gold tried everything turn turd... Imo, everything we’ve learned fellow man pandemic bad. People fought masking disease spreading killed people! course they’re still willing give people colds. It’s really disappointing, it’s reality. agree.  feel pain. Also moved right Covid hit I’m finally making friends...mental health serious consideration. Get vaccine, hang around sensible humans vaxxed, live life. True, least VR technology achieves near-realism. Yes. I'm UK rules place different shape form depending local council. think risk ending ICU COVID little bit higher risk getting hit meteorite walking... Thank you! real people… get sick. It’s part life. Try living less fear… it’ll make less sick! Article states, virologist, problem. states close another mutation vaccines longer work back square 1.

That effects everyone. think lot people, especially Americans, realize mean EVERYONE. planet needs get vaccinated herd immunity. huge task.

This likely 100% years. claim you. setback happens, places lockdown freezer trucks return icus overrun. It’s absolutely bizarre WSJ shitty journalism again. Paper sequences published request removal. journalists even research anymore go Twitter days see articles cook spot?  Okay lost credibility statement. don’t know that. passive conflated you.

Considering point consistent lack acknowledging says all.  
The death rate 7% without medical interference. great science save science also prevent getting it.

50% young people mild covid experience long term effects. 

 Let alone killing granny. ""the whole point reduce spread.""

The point stop people dying. really technicality. vaccines approved data showed took die. Early data make conclusion transmission large majority people, side effects lasted maybe couple days, that. friends almost side effects others severe described like bad flu. Nobody likes feeling sick feel like people get worked bad side effects may even happen.   That's true all. Many us fully vaccinated people want get back normal diligently following public health measures since start thing, vaccination literally far take it, there's better way protect others. 

Personally I'm ditching mask yet, totally get people are. Unvaccinated people ones causing receiving spread out, rest us would like get back normal eventually (and virus eradicated, never happen). Asymptomatic ""long covid"" psychosomatic.  never said anything ebola. one people SEVERELY risk, even though don’t look it. active cancer, chemo daily, I’m also Type 1 Diabetic Hyperthyroidism (these big, heavy hitters). 

Now know that, one people couldn’t get vaccinated really long time. I’m vaccinated, I’d still willing take one team. choose get vaccinated, think people, deep down, hope reality hit face really fucking hard. someone extremely risk, know I’m against. I’m still strict quarantine even vaccinated. understand everyone that, it’s absolutely fair put population people high risk, I’d still willing take one team needed to. sooner people face consequences actions, sooner rest us get back normal life. agreed, Canadian here. Things looking good. keeping eye UK Southern States comparing numbers interesting summer LOL. braces myself. parents thought worth thousands. requires self awareness. literally driven cars outdoor vaccination clinics tried prove magnetic due vaccine making brass keys stick necks , national tv less!

Either anti-vaxxers stupid point chargeable offence remotely aware unbelievably stupid acting. hilarious 

You misrepresenting “scientists” saying 

I don’t need provide evidence, it’s poste subreddit *all time*. 

I’m ignoring anything. **Im pointing everything said supported evidence, supported experts disconnected reality** Newspaper articles, news agency reports, correspondent's dispatches, etc. always name city report written in/sent from. ""city, date"" format see front articles.

In case, Reuters seems office Slovakia, cover country using Prague offices (which makes sense). without everyone looking oddity.

I think projecting. wearing masks anymore, enough people look weirdly it. Love it. Actually two Marvel Disney+ shows also relevant current events past year. despite exponential growth Delta variant

Exponential bit stretch, growth consistent rather ever rapid, far. think matters still transmit. get long Covid. Neither certain right now. would say it’s unlikely. Still good opinion cautious.

A somewhat related example longer term effects asymptomatic Covid kids developing mis-c. it’s completely question. He's afraid stand Boris's decisions, that's one improvement. state got rid mask mandates 3 months ago see significant change Covid rate. forever wear mask public. saved thousands braces. slowly rising Yeah, happens time regular viruses. People get used it. Ebola never spread far US. Influenza much less contagious less deadly. He's replaced Javid... He's medical professional. worked finacial firms though. responded points, that's all. thought moot points relevant incorrect, nothing skewer on.

But seem agree lot fewer restrictions many places.

By means go protest care all. say *only* anti-vaxxers protesting? suggest there's significant overlap. seem take exception this, maybe 100% correct little overlap, believe so.

Anyway, seem agree, differing levels aggression. Thanks thoughtful response: unfortunate see it.

The fundamental problem saw beginning solved socialism: worker-owned co-operatives would see vast increases worker productivity also result rises worker wages benefits. Everyone except CDC saw coming. Shocker. Author big short new book CDC works incentives responds to

We need learn adapt pandemic response overhaul staff CDC Kids young adults (very) rarely get severely ill, get severely ill aged 50+. Israel people aged 50 90+% vaccinated. Vaccines keep getting virus. allow body fight get sick lowers chance spreading it. 1967 would call Great News! knew small % vaccinated people would still get sick possibly die. feel bad families.

But tiny number around 600, minus died things covid (but still reported here), incredibly encouraging. comment specifically US. supply issues everyone access vaccines months. sub thinned left mostly crazies Maybe rethink look higher average incidence breathrough cases Israel. Albeit population 55% vaxxed, they've still recorded decent amount fully vaxxed person (w/Pfizer) contracting Delta variant portion hospitalized. Vaccines work also simple public health measures variants brought control. Masks always meant last / first line defense. Vaccination rate high, cases stable? Masks off. Don’t know new variant acts, might break vaccines? Masks back on. Variant burns cases back low stable? Masks off. israel lot vaccinated people test positive Delta variant. Obviously much lower risk serious illness hospitalization. could mean still spread vaccinated hit unvaccinated. that’s thing, Covid isn’t going anywhere long millions unvaccinated people keep letting mutate something worse. How's symptoms entire vaccine dose? can’t tired political soon CDC always said possible local areas could bring back mandates depending spread. Masks coming back always possible.

I don’t think happens US anyway. 

But it’s mask, shit isn’t 1984 lmao. Trust government would much rather see face track you. understanding even vaccinated still X% getting it, believe variant one wiggle way in.

From I've read depending manufacturer X% gets larger, say V1 5% V2 30% chance still get delta variant covid.

Idk true is, probably best look yourself. true, mask probably decrease 30% chance 0% specially unvaccinated around might increase actual chance youd encounter it. already fucking dead inside anyway. barely care anymore. future's bleak fucked anyway.

Barely emotions. like fashion aside protection (protect others) Yea, commented aforementioned post got downvoted hell contradicting shared news article conflicting news article efficacy vaccines delta variant. Nah. many places still require it, museums shops... Miami, New Orleans NYC tourist People refuse. won’t lock down, wear masks, socially distance, etc... time (even worse last time) mean yes, asymptomatic hospitalizations deaths overall miniscule. last thing want cases long haul symptoms popping everywhere know asymptomatic. Would extra level comfort knowing vaccines removed factor. Would also great communicate another incentive vaccinations  quick

So spread Delta variant. India first identified. mean that’s originated. hard sell argument say ANYONE US wearing masks CDC made mandate Thanks adding context it. makes sense, think stage pandemic, asking flat unrealistic, even technically right thing do. average person exhausted, frankly level infections (at least us, I'm speaking countries) low throw fit it, especially cases dropping \~200 day per state.  I'm stuck Mexico J&amp;J age group, leadership fixation getting Chinese vaccines Athletes probably going take vaccine fear side effects. I’d surprised vaccination rate 20%. thing Canada we're going fast vaccines difference 1st doses 2nd doses isnt much concern right now. 76% eligible people 1st dose 27% doses rate 1.25% per day means another 10% Canada Day nearly last week July. 

Even see delta variant cases double week hit 70% fully vaccinated would still fraction wave saw. Alberta sequences every case variants we're seeing ~20 per day. would take 100x explosion us hit prior 3rd wave peak, going happen 4 weeks. took months circulating delta strain take India started growing rapidly. tested positive Monday. I'm fully vaccinated wear mask time.

This new variant seems fairly infectious. 

A lot people around vaxed wear masks perhaps contributed catching it. guess let unvaccinated either die develop antibodies getting virus. socio-economical costs goes it. Kinda like smokers, smoking contagious.

Covid probably continue mutate thanks them, hopefully anything defeat current vaccines. Vaccinated people continue mostly normal, masks optional. They’re necessarily contradictory. CDC says fully vaxed people gather without masks. says vaxed need keep wearing lot people aren’t yet vaccinated. Know surroundings. Small group fellow vaxers? Ditch mask. Going Wal-Mart? Mask up.  going happen. We're done masks offices re-opening. We're going ride here. Yea... community transmission shit? attainable get community spread ( unknown spread cases). idiots follow simple measures like wearing mask. Ok, thanks productive comment! Let know enough enough you. Yearly flu covid vaccines new normal  People won’t get vaccinated people won’t wear masks healthcare worker, RN medical daycare center nobody wearing masks. shut week later thank God everyone okay immediate future. Unfortunately lost patients 40yr old driver 5 kids last year. Ah. ""I really actually care""  unvaccinated people Missouri concerned, get vaccinated.

Except people 12, that's yet option  They're gently breaking news lol fully vaccinated people would die Covid likely extremely old unhealthy people preexisting conditions Flu even poses threat them.

That matches mRNA vaccines protection severe illness, less effective mRNA vaccines preventing symptomatic illness.  They'll either say fuck hoax yeah result  year half

SOURCE???! ^^^/s  answer everyone followed guidelines, everyone wore masks, everyone got vaccinated, would returning normal now, already there. People selfish though complain time returning normal refusing get vaccine wear mask. get stuck no-mans land. think best time try teach society manners around queueing.

I’ll wear mask business requires it’s choice unless hear vaccine isn’t effective variant Yep, pretty much this. New variant might area *yet*, time gets wearing mask already. People wearing masks inside businesses around me. I've started getting bit more. signs say unvaccinated need masks everyone wears them. really nice whole pandemic live people taken seriously taken steps protect other. feel really bad people that. second well. Every vaccine different. Makes sense grouped stats. I've idea downvoted.

Sometimes truth scares people try wish away.

http://i.imgur.com/MFdTOaq.jpg didn’t think people wearing masks nuts think try make sure healthcare workers ample access public went nuts buying all. people *only* ones left vaccine, I'm 100% you. I'll get boosters they're necessary beyond people made bed pay protection mind. haven’t read articles, I’m sure complained.

I don’t understand 3 day rule athletes vaccinated negative PCR tests.  Got sure. CA here. We're good. November 2019. CDC could worded shit way better.

Definitely. really fucked mask messaging, especially beginning. time, wearing mask major way reduce spread.. masks also extremely short supply.

They wanted preserve limited masks available healthcare workers, way explained public beyond terrible. also recently said women age 18-50 drink alcohol case become pregnant. suck entire dick. Yeah honestly care. I'm still someone parents respond well vaccine, living highly unvaccinated area, smart least check monitor situation Delta. I'm currently wearing mask unless I'm them, guidance came fully vaccinated people need masks everywhere, I'll it. store wants wear one, will. go doctor's dentist, want wear one, will. Even really make sense latter me, honor request. still living life pandemic, mask. mean living social life hand, outside missing sporting events, generally lived exactly like pandemic.

I see issue wearing mask. honestly get people do. Yes sucks, fogs glasses, uncomfortable, hot, get it, wanting kill wearing cloth mask? Man, thought mental health issues. think people need seriously see therapist that's case. recommend it, helped ton. Oxygen water, two highly corrosive chemicals. Everyone ever come contact either eventually died. Man can’t even imagine started restricting non-vax people US. 
The anti-vaxxers would quite literally take arms start rioting. hard enough getting morons wear mask pretty much bribe “on-the-fence” people get vaxxed. You’re much angry wording comment failed understand. Sensitive maybe? Truly sorry putting piece fabric half face much you.  listen whoever want. 
In US places removing mask requirements, still mask public want. Well, fuxk. fun lasted. may require it, experience rarely enforce it. really speak Washington DC though. National Zoo yesterday supposed wear masks inside buildings outside parts stay 6 feet apart. Signs everywhere. Nobody that. one people wearing mask people kept crowding right next day. I'm vaccinated I'm worried, annoyed people can't follow basic rules. I'm going American History Museum July 12th, interesting see since require masks entire time. Nope, Israel recent. Making every single person wear something face pretty massive thing. 

Like imagine 0.1% dies saw shirt wasn’t red. Would society collectively come together make sure every person world wore red shirts? Sorry that’s terrible analogy lol.

My point is, 0.1% find ways work around risk. 99.9% us don’t alter lives them. wear N95s respirators something don’t care perfect world, I'd agree let anti vaxxers fend themselves, cannot get vaccinated? Like small children, immunocompromised, elderly? really gonna say ""sucks suck""? suppose makes sense. vaccines make likely symptoms mild, likely contribute community spread. course spread have, variants we'll make. 

This going LLOOONNGGG fucking pandemic. 

Good news though looks like Pfizer need booster year. know others.  agency's fault. people actively spread shit ""don't want part biggest human experiment ever.""

It sucks, others. believe thst report using data UK ended weekend June 4th. I'm looking see happens month June Delta's spreading UK bit more. 

The linked article links Wall Street journal article, can't read whole thing, says recent outbreak Israel half people infected fully vaccinated I’m conspiranoid heard anything it, distrust something perfect true. 

Why triggered though? vaxxed, still wear mask maybe person interacting not, maybe unknowingly need booster unprotected. end story.  stop ""doing part"" ? also buy stocks? Nah, look UK data. mRNA vaccines highly effective preventing Delta infection entirely -79%. US almost exclusively uses mRNA They’re woods. screw up, it’s fault due high level vaccine hesitancy.

Do complete quote properly now, darling. I'll highlight gone Nah, look UK data. **Subect=UK** mRNA vaccines highly effective preventing Delta infection entirely -79%. **Subect still UK** US almost exclusively uses mRNA vaccines. **A relevant aside USA**

**HERE WOULD USE DEVICE SHIFT SUBJECT OVERTLY, PREVIOUS They’re woods. **Subject=Still UK, changed**If **They=Subect=UK** screw up, it’s **Their=Subject=UK** fault due high level vaccine hesitancy.

See English fun yet incredibly frustrating once? Keep up. clear, I'm talking solely Pfizer here.

95% effectiveness reduction risk *symptomatic illness* Covid Classic, mean original Wuhan strain. measure dropped 95% 88% Delta.

Reduction risk symptomatic illness seems primary statistic cited vaccine effectiveness. What? No... implying stubborn selfish shortsightedness downfall? way! I'm asking lockdown. think stupid CDC drop mask mandate did. Wanting people wear least cloth mask really asking much - especially evidence Israel suggests fully vaccinated people spreading Delta variant. Hence reccommendation. masked well year went NOWHERE. state top 5 vaccination rates there’s way I’m putting mask back on. Nope.  There's going lot angry people CDC says ""Fully vaccinated people need wear masks due Delta variant"".

True, us never stopped wearing masks, nice benefits, bit able hide part face, express feelings might appropriate work, like laughing customers get told customers.

Like, basically actively took measures keep shit going (including going get indoor massage COVID+) reaping benefits. infuriating see coasted, perpetuated problem, can't seem see much people sacrificed (including uncle's life). Mine went told asked never see needle kind fine delta variant super duper contagious releases statement best way prevent death never born  Can't safe kid covid, bad, mean can't spread people catch kid going different experience kid did? rename sub Covid fear mongering mean wearing mask difficult really need debate 2 orgs. fine travel, wanting leave country see world difficult premise lockdowns restrictions ""just"" preventing death, preventing collapse healthcare system disease unknown impact.

I'm vaccinated. area control. hospitals running stable rate. going back always-masks unless get told severe variant renders current vaccines ineffective.  Unless I'm friends know fully vaccinated, I'm still wearing one shopping, getting nails done, etc. Humanity proved sucks lies, trust people anymore. anti vax people can't get vaccine tho unfortunately. Though people probably staying home part.  Dont care really - still dumbass. terrible, also dream well facets live lockdown life I'm realistic enough able admit that. wore mask every single day throughout pandemic like everyone else social distanced, received vaccines well people around unfair ask us continue living lockdown forever.

Go ask global economy people lost livelihoods really terrible. empathize immune compromised special needs, rest us survive can't oblivious completely ignore ramifications pandemic done. intents purposes over, time resume life. Vaccinated people safe enough maskless.  % vaccinated people hospitalized ridiculously low deaths even lower.

The issue vaccinated people still act vector spread it.  still many unvaccinated people spread to.  IMO asking vaccinated people wear masks protect unvaccinated people.

I sympathy unvaccinated point (in USA...where free easy get country. including countries less vaccine availability rant here) .  I'm comfortable 99%+ protection hospitalization death covid vaccine affords me.  

If data changes time variants prove dangerous enough vaccinated people, I'll go back wearing mask everywhere.  then...fuck anti vaxxers. I'm inconveniencing help protect even bare minimum protect (and everyone else). *grabs hard hat* 

Challenge accepted Depends type. google county's covid cases every often. whole state averaging less 100 new cases week. Like said; pretty much here, hope rest country world far behind! get coming from. husband vaccinated, kids old enough vaccine. (and kids) wear mask public protect them, consideration anti-vax/anti-mask people. huge population feels certain way trying change way feel arguing that?

I'm sorry, maybe misunderstood other. I'm arguing that. know difficult, maybe impossible, convince people try wear masks again. I'm worried may necessary try, we've done piss-poor job preventing variants spreading. 

It sucks. *really* sucks. like do. like it, mean ignore it. short sighted reactionary. Look come tell antimaskers even vaccine people need wear them.

Yeah, agree that's concern too. easy answers here. No, drove 80 miles get jabbed soon could.

""Shoot Juice me, bruce""

Put gallon me, Allan Oh too, fully vacc’d since early April I’m dropping mask  Yes, that's correct.  always vaccine resistant. still catch full dose Pfizer. Half new delta cases Israel fully vaxxed people symptoms. gotta stop hysteria anecdotal experiences, even people 100% complied masking nonstop bitching it. personally never saw big deal either. forgot days. often wore 10-12 hours day work throughout entire pandemic, people complain put for, what, 60 minutes max store? Please... 

It's really bizarre bent shape people become asked endure extremely minor discomfort safety others, even agree ultimately comply. I've yet figure either. didn’t name it. I’m sorry gave impression did.

I submitting research peer review, I’m sure lack structure bothersome Reddit.

And like said before, I’m quite happy supplying scholarly articles studies would like (as done 3 people DM’d me) don’t know level article understood, it’s tough pinpoint start. example, post study Bovine coronavirus, someone zoonotic viral understanding easily deduce relates human coronavirus see correlation reduced severity. post study molecular structure explains lack change spike protein degradation various pieces, limit audience minimal understanding cell structure chemistry. cases “supplied” support basic principles declining virulence confused less understanding. Hence recommendation understanding basics trying understand types papers. words, could supply samples Latin. point supported I’ve supplied necessary paperwork. can’t read Latin, point?

At point say (nor elude to) “trust me” because… Don’t trust me! Science based questioning everything! if, whatever understanding, leads deepen strengthen understanding particular subject, fantastic! Share thoughts! It’s responsibility take thoughts (with know) apply others know validity. It’s responsibility validate invalidate thoughts based findings. One invites debate latter invites argument. 

Cheers! Plenty people wildfire country already them. Also plenty people already jobsites dealt hazardous material.  Hopefully thats developed country over-polluting over-consumer period. rural area, maybe 15,000 people? even bigger towns cities seen many wearing masks, probably 30% point. looking state whole looks like we're averaging less 100 new cases week. Yeah, nah. Lulz Wearing mask public spaces “bending backwards”. Truly unbearable burden cause collapse modern society people aren’t relieved it. Relax man I’m attacking you, looking source. Frankly, no, credentials don’t provide credibility since internet anyone make anything up. That’s asked peer-reviewed reputable sources saying this. reason expressed surprise followed (strictly science) COVID19 subreddit better part year, content I’ve seen related expected future mutations [this recent piece titled “Has SARS-CoV-2 Reached Peak theory virus would evolve become less deadly seemed reasonable start, yes agree seem intuitive, yet variants clearly exhibiting behavior. seems intuitive virus would become milder time, seems intuitive science often wrong. unless have, provide source, showing “every coronavirus ever” started much severe virus, capable killing large numbers people causing long term complications double digit percentage infected, think it’s bit hard back position. 

“Go start Biology” isn’t really reasonable either. prevailing, generally-accepted theory among experts COVID-19 become “common cold” surely literature expressing opinion exists posted. Pfizer phase 3 results kids 1 11 can't come soon enough Moderna vaccine killed me. got incredibly sick. booster anything like regular shot, there's 0% chance subject every 6-months. I'll stay home, wear mask always, best. I'm taking dreadful shots. It’s troublesome. Leftist communities likely great number people vaccinated thus requiring masks. get fully vaxxed, mask. End story. unrelated news, also urges potty trained adults continue wear diapers someone lives Missouri 100% surprised. stopped wearing mask precautions places last month(heck places didn’t even precautions whole time) top rural communities refuse get vaccinated. personally glad I’m suburbs Kansas City least 50% least partial vaccinated cases super low. hope people get vaccinated don’t want kid wear mask social distance 1st grade too. Kindergarten shit show. sucks father hospital Covid get vaccine also said going live fear, comes point live life comment:

WHO: yeah, many people lose it? like smokers, smoking contagious.

Do need start putting anti-smoking ads back TV? There's reason laws smoking indoors, secondhand smoking dangerous. live San Mateo county. know San Diego lot conservative. used live college nice, though. No, full safety efficacy trials done. concurrently instead one another. don’t think changes anything. fully vaccinated won’t worry. good idea cause even Israel vaccination peaked 57%, need take measures reach 80%  belittle grievances. I'm camp too.

Vaccines stop getting seriously sick covid. stated goal never stop ever catching it.

There always variants - even vaccinated people like could catch covid without knowing help create new variants.

At point society must accept risk. Life can't continue zero risk, that's life, that's mere existence.  yeah yall dont local transmission sooo Nope, take flying frolic moon.  Like original comment said. starting see type sentiment even leftist communities. It’s troublesome. What’s target? days ago masks you’re vaccinated. we’re moving goalposts again. 

The harmful thing make people aren’t vaccinated think point getting vaccinated. Imposing exact restrictions vaccines became available exactly that. Probably bit late. started vaccinating entire athlete body, coaching, media spectators, maybe different story  mad anti-vaxxers, record. hum... thought gen 2 3 vaccines showing pretty good results variant fo ccpvirus vaxxed? Anyone believed 2 weeks /was absolute moron. Oh, please. 

If wash hands poops, simple things public health. give shit he's veteran. heard? UFOs real. Google it. Government came confirmed it. live people still wear crowded places like grocery store. funny comment imma hand downvote principle thanks. exit strategy start working preventing misinformation spreading like wildfire. unironically need ministry truth. country anyone wants vaccinate can, lot people 1 500 000 chance getting bloodcloth. father's physician told vaccinate autoimmune disease. can't argue doctor. teachers medical personal idiots, change covid keep existing, keep mutating keep fucking us over.

There's option say fuck it, open everything let natural selection take course. I'm inclined agree it. document.write(‘Keep fuckin’ masks quit yer whinin’); Amazing think globally relevant century pandemic. kid can't get vaccinated yet, vaccinated people may spreading delta variant. 

You read things talk confidently. think depends live. Nobody know getting vaccine sole reason able go supermarket without mask on.

This said, know people minority, (anti-maskers etc), would affect them. I’m exact position you. *constantly* diligently masked (double masking KN95) even holiday gatherings, stayed quarantined inside 90% time. constantly used hand sanitizer sure physically distance, got shots moment became eligible back March.

Fuck WHO. fully enjoying freedom. sacrificed first year 20s good society, I’m sacrificing more! summarize rules arriving UK eg Greece 
\- get pre-departure test

\- provide locator form

\- quarantine 10 days arrival

\- buy take PCR test day two quarantine 

\- buy take PCR test day eight quarantine 

\- regardless vaccination status

Is politics? told they're 90% effective high rates would solve problem.

Rates low. me, already lost credibility. Whether say masks not, I'm finished vaccination I'm still gonna keep wearing masks. No, don’t think Colombia lot people get tested initially getting 2 doses also every months keep check titers. Remember you’re hanging COVID subreddit. place always leant heavily extremes. 

Everyone know real world shares sentiment. extremely good following guidelines, got vaccinated, things like person hangouts bar visits resumed. social circle still sometimes wears masks it’s much lax now, again, vaccinated. That’s logical approach.

Very people real world going go back pandemic life without fight. totally agree fatigue real thing (I totally get it) we're point US enough people vaccinated see massive spike like last year, remember people getting vaccinated taking precautions past year big reason deal losing anyone know. 

Many, many families get luxury. It’s serious issue many men dont take antidepressants side effect. hope medical community figures 2 co-exist. It’s important too. Silver lining, lots progress psychedelics, like mushrooms, treating depression leaps n bounds. 

You summed past year pretty well, don’t past trauma dick. Lol. Basic hygiene, keeping house order, getting bed, issue one point another (too often) past year half. Depression it’s finest. I’m worse public mask changes, obviously still wearing mine. went away recently surrounded beautiful nature, less people, really helped get different headspace. 

This hard long. Please know you’re alone get better times...  sound morbid, agree. enough anti Vax get sick suffer maybe they're stop god damned stupid. wish harm upon anyone, damn... what's alternative?? refuse listen reason. isolated 1.25, wore masks RELIGIOUSLY, traumatizing side effects second moderna dose (I’d again). I’m done. understand variants work I’m done masks isolating. “Give us money please”  followed every single rule without complaint fully vaccinated. due respect, suck it.  Well guess that’s fair since didn’t care anyone else died didn’t want wear mask. Fuck me. went MLB game saw maybe ten ppl masks Delta variant, chance surface transmission still low like UK original variant? antidepressants won’t affect sex life, Wellbutrin (bupropion) take SSRIs gave similar issues yours. could also try finding cognitive behavioral therapist, it’s shown effective medicine involved (though combination effective). Lol. Nah… Maybe ask talk manager coronavirus got mine even knew risk. millions people. incidence teeny tiny, effect mild treatable, virus carries much higher risk much severe myocarditis. totally fine. Hell yeah boys finally go back banks mask without drawing suspension Would wear whatever told meant protecting family. Really? vaccinations? BIGGEST wave? “It’s better catching Covid” doctor says suggests nobody ever breathes enough evidence Ivermectin effective, crazy person would take prophylactic, even effective, rather getting vaccinated. would understand getting vaccinated taking prophylactic, nothing believe little flu prophylactic alternative vaccination nonsense. old bill burr method tests actual titers? Either way, even produce/keep circulating antibodies necessarily mean protected. bodies also cellular immune response make cells specifically fight covid. Unfortunately test easily accessed/done general public can't check manage make cells.

But without insurance would screwed. Good job! surely shamed traumatized veteran wearing mask likely never going outside again! big viral load

Are still talking corona cross syphilis?  probably know now, anyone else reading - SSRI side effects far, far worse first 3-4 weeks. people (not though) 90% side effects reside period. simple. Emotions motivations change    people masked/distanced gotten vaccinated, would exiting. ""whats exit strategy, tell exactly else I'm gonna act like nothing wrong"" people keep adding fuel fire complaining getting cooler. 

Funny thing is, everyone done good job following restrictions, around world, vaccines would still phase 3 trials. getting that? look around 7 day average Florida 1,692 California 924. I’m wrong, correct myself, please show me. One athlete (Ugandan) already tested positive vaccination initial negative test arrival. delta variant too. one knows look like population level. data far mostly vaccinated populations Delta causing cases rocket upwards Israel. mostly happening schools unvaccinated kids, better believe restrictions (and suggesting wear mask...oh no) going come back starts tearing children causing severe illness hospitalizations previous versions virus. 

Look weekly % increases NY Times tracker like 100+ counties rural TX, MO, OK etc right now. Yeah they're mostly unvaccinated seeing *1000+%* increases weekly cases, already large per capita numbers.

I hope helps Delta. time tell. chance going away forever pretty much zero… there’s always gonna cases around. they’re talking yearly vaccines stuff, getting 0 pretty much outta question even public health level Sure. likely fed false information much leg work check it. I'm dense, maybe, fair understand one's beliefs come meet point discussion. does, fuck it. still can’t get haircut Ontario 7 months lockdown straight suddenly variants start causing fuckery vaccinated people need new vax turns “one year next vaccine” I’m done. Please lick give COVID Kill then. I’m done this. I’ve followed every rule start. I’m getting second shot week, family directly affected COVID I’ve done everything try part goes much longer, lick me, seriously. start notice people natural immunity get reinfected variants nearly much adapted immune response whole virus single specific protein.

Research psychedelics carefully intelligently, helped lot. hope find way. correct answer.

The vaccination rate USA much higher world average.

The availability hospital beds per capita, oxygen supplies, mention various medicines, higher USA. staff.

U.S. support people suffering economically lockdowns worse countries... better lot others. *should* another huge hospital surge, basically USA could convince / support people stay isolated, again, Brazil India done ever do.

For reasons, USA risk Delta variant many countries speaking to. need singing tune.  want ride. I've hardlining mandatory vaxxer. Very. course saw occasional anti-mask family Walmart, part everyone masking. 2 days Biden announced end mask mandate went away. places see still affected: Fast food chains. still opened lobbies. I'm thinking lack workers might something that. Sure. much society fact receiving news targeted demographic ensure clicks. get (and many) cases pretty obvious right wrong side. However pretty striking even dissecting news source see missing. problem, need find mask that's good big noses though. can't find though :/ kids affected delta variant? variants (so minimal symptoms) catch easier? Nah, like backwards thinking like comment that's Masks vaccines, yeah they’ll probably persist while. Perpetual shutdowns, end soon enough. china pay? Same. Fatigue real thing. don’t know single person died everyone know vaccinated. I’m done masks part looking entire world advice may differ region due type vaccines distributed worldwide. 

Personally, I’m kind done giving fuck adults aren’t vaccinated yet. They’ve made beds. don’t mind wearing mask. I’ll wear mask I’m place kids could be, don’t choice get vaccine not. establishment late night, masks aren’t required vaccinated customers, likely won’t wear mask. oh issue Floridians, governor, that's all, Florida awesome. wish go back day ""I pick choose want hear"" 740k shots day peak 3.3M daily shots April! Hopefully see big uptick approved kids. Squarespace! Idk that. Every time go people still wearing masks live, even though adults vaccinated, pretty much government restrictions ended stores aren’t requiring them. think it’d mostly anti-maskers never accepted first place widely complained again. British tourist came anytime soon Greece UKs amber list, even vaccinated Brits would required quarantine returning UK. It'd make sense cut lose British tourists focus others. would important make people feel extra safe prevent possible outbreaks Delta variant.    money. They're really charged relatively low fee extra Covid tests. They're also restricting certain activities places board ship, restricting access shows plus allowing dine dining room previously scheduled time. (One things cruisers love try different restaurants board. They'll banned those.) idea restrict enough worth go. 

It's important note, countries cruise ships visit probably restrict unvaccinated going ashore. they'll stuck ship too. elusive jersey shore vampires strike again.  hope friend recover quickly soon. 

Also, thank justifying still wearing mask careful go out. Please read article commenting everyone. don’t actually data efficiency yet anything (but apparently J&amp;J testing lab setting now) end article urge us wait. Got first COVID shot couple months ago (Pfizer). Got busy never went back second supposed to. 
 
I'm going go ASAP realize timing two doses probably pretty important... need third one anything? going less effective me? GB athletes able get vaccinated without leaving country. mean like said earlier India FAR better spot April/May. Cases even low certain areas, lowest ever since start pandemic. low vaccinations India mind you.

So Delta may cause things spike bit... likely nearly bad worst Pandemic crash eventually. Florida twice number new cases Missouri. Last year Gov decided reply AZ available people 60. Pfizer trickling now. Basically put eggs one basket basket went bad. Delta blmay reinfexting people higher rate OG Alpha.  Holy shit spread possible mutation would bind different receptor?

International border crossing restrictions one last things return normalcy. Bad example, IMHO; border closures one effective disease control measures introduced, they've prematurely relaxed (like UK/India), dire consequences political fallout resulted.

Compared reporting days, actually bad. correct. 

It's ratio comparing vaccinated unvaccinated. tell actual level infection, relative levels infection. That's incredibly insensitive die- vaccinated careful.

It's also incredibly DANGEROUS altitude, taking mask precautions inevitably lead enough spread new mutations occur: strong evolutionary pressure favor mutations reduce vaccine effectiveness...

We're together: live die together. pandemic virus mutating substantial rate, we're safe least careful vulnerable among us... Ummmm......huh? That's works. tests random, neither positives. one linked existing cluster. efficacy give relative performance?

It 2000 people exposed = 100 cases 2000 people * odds unvaccinated person gets covid given exposure * (1 - efficacy rate). misunderstood?

I'm setting odds infection exposure 1 unvaccinated person, simplicity.

In reality, lot depends route dose exposure. instance, Covid poor spread via fomites: basically share utensils meal infected person high transmission way. Whereas, infected person coughs directly face high viral load... NSW 8.3 million. lockdown cover 6.5 million roughly.  curious thing anti-vaxxers think can't possibly get stupider, manage surprise you. I'm sick selfish, scientifically illiterate morons dragging rest us down. difference is, everyone exposed COVID infected. 

This assuming sufficient viral dose 100% infection rates unvaccinated individuals. misconception latest estimates secondary household attack rates around 17%

Rates vary heavily based behavior. instance m, roommate Covid wear mask around tiny apartment despite coughing everywhere, like: ""hand washing, what's that?"" course got it. Whereas people respectfully quarantine rooms.

Hence helpful assume 100% infectious exposure, rather getting weeds precisely much someone exposed attack rates... level headed hope see improvement coming months. family five longCovid CFS symptoms 10 months following Covid experience. Around 10 months symptoms started falling away one one. Best wishes recovery.  clue it. pisses 50m Novavax shots order, TGA appears putting resources approving J&amp;J instead, don’t order. We’ve known Novavax fantastic shot since March UK trail results come out. Novavax filed approval January, appear submitted data regulator end May, perhaps TGA simply haven’t data. one holiday?

As bug bruvax, ones decided federal system wasn’t good enough needed own. end, even June still huge bugs bruvax (incl registering people telling waiting list not) vaccinet whatever name works actually quite well.

lol, like 10% 20+% depending vaccine used. CDC needs straight country let data speak.

Go ahead downvote bad new bear, change facts. Thanks, need.   bold well even vaccinated people.

AstraZeneca claimed 92% ""hospitalization"" Delta, 100% variant. means efficacy ""symptomatic infection"", 60-80% before, would probably \~50% delta. pretty sure sinovac/sinopharm boat, worse.

Even moderna BioNtech less 80% infections Delta.

If transmission chain stopped, even people end hospital, mutation occur.

i.e., keep protections. whole controversy served legitimize Sputnik V vaccine

Did work? According official website displaying government's work agenda Wednesday, 14,214 people registered get inoculated vaccine, 8,004 already got shot.

Not neccesarily need, benefit substantially from.

1'st shot 2'nd reduces breakthrough symptomatic infections 67% 12%. reasonable say third shot might reduce like 4%. Yeah wife talk yesterday, tired this. talk dropping masks stores. right though, worth celebrating. That, telling can’t people need more. would also better money fell sky rather go work  Oxford/AstraZeneca explanation 90% efficacy turned wrong. got lower doses also bigger gap two shots. That, turned out, improved outcome. know now, strategy delaying second dose paid UK, unorthodox.


But half dose still work. Could mean many doses people.   deal expected German giant Merck, huge vaccine division, British health secretary, Matt Hancock, said torpedoed guarantee UK would get priority doses available.

By time AstraZeneca got involved, Oxford’s scientists already set early trials. meant, said Ward, studies tailored needs regulators way big drug companies would done it.

It's amazing small choices affect things.
A better drug trial rollout could mean az used much earlier. Trust me. I’m fully vaxxed still choosing wear mask public spaces. I’m aware delta variant Cali it’s matter days it’s here.

My comment popular can't argue last 2 sentences.. public accusation DSMB extraordinary indifference shown FDA palpable too. thought time partly turn focus away FDA's decision **not** go ""*1st doses first*"" strategy introduced UK largely criticised US. proved excellent strategy saved many lives UK adopting cost many US.

I’ve seen people periodically attempt revisionist history regards Florida’s handling pandemic. Nothing schadenfreude point, I’m saving empathy places actually trying. bad predict understand western media hellbent trying paint Sputnik vaccine bad.

Because Russia (China too) actively spread disinformation vaccines virus itself. act war.  UK prioritized vaccinating vulnerable youth superspreaders. strategy high case count low death count. 95% vulnerable fully vaccinated. vulnerable 98% deaths till now. implies 94% reduction case fatality rate. 2% cases dying earlier 0.1% flu.

Since youth fully vaccinated case count high. also AZ effective hospitalizations deaths low efficacy infections. tends get effective time. over, get comfortable.

Far, far fewer 100 people die year meterorites. fact, there's ONE well-documented case ever happening: India last year. Thousands injured impact event Siberia, though: possible died (records poor, Russia tried hide time...)

Covid-19 still managed kill around 600 people vaccinated (out MILLIONS exposed).

So frankly, statistic came rear. It’ll different every individual. first Moderna shot knocked loop (fever, chills) sore arm, second shot gave minor effects. 

I suspect caught COVID bit earlier Arizona (chills 3 days 90°F outside), hence strong reaction shot #1 … health provider like don’t test still walk.  EY! MISTAH PRIME MINISTAH!

Yep. Phase III trials Pfizer Moderna 94-95% effective. someone trained Clinical Research give two shits later data time fully analyzed based smaller samples far- Phase 3 trials FDA relies issuing final approval reason...

So, 2000 people exposed Covid-19, 100 still get infected. tiny % still die- mostly 65+ age group, especially otherwise idea widespread vaccination halt outbreaks, seniors go &amp; lives without worrying they're rolling dice every time hit Landmark see Broadway revival show.

Huh, response article lot different compared reports came Covid (and many viruses) cause exact thing everyone decided freak out. I’m questioning proof vax, questioning fact they’re giving students type reprieve restrictions even ensuring students staff vaccinated.

The school hard pro-lockdown state, they’re serious restrictions well. really. Breakthrough infections happening.  poor title account population. Still, pathetic Florida cases per capita California Texas, much populous.

Florida currently 6th worst per capita cases, 4th hospitalizations, 2nd deaths.

That exactly I'd interpret it, too. think look back pandemic 10 years now, biggest failure compliance public health initiatives--it'll messaging. Well, no, still concerning. hospitalised week that... There's growing evidence show countries zero COVID strategies hard time ramping vaccinations population feel urgency getting vaccinated. 

What evidence that? I've heard lot vaccine hesitancy Japan, zero-covid country. got Taiwan get vaccines political reasons, Vietnam able afford Australia NZ purchased yet doses delivered. None us even chance vaccine hesitancy issue. 

The polling NZ shows 90% population keen vaccinated, much higher US. govt huge pressure deliver vaccines opposition makes regular attack point. tourists makes sense lack recognition COVID going endemic strange me.

There's lack recognition. head Ministry Health said repeatedly Covid endemic NZ, abandon elimination strategy population vaccinated. However mean nothing control all. plan move elimination suppression, keeping numbers low possible. public health system poorly funded lowes rate ICU beds per capita developed world, can't afford big outbreaks. link? noticed yesterday overly pessimistic posters quiet past months popped heads holes sudden spouting old rhetoric. Seems slightly suspicious. wife man age 30? not, fine  little careful words here? 

There study UK showed reduced efficacy symptomatic infections.

I assume mean efficacy hospitalization death?  likely downvoted data yet far Delta concerned. efficacy data relates prior strains. think anyone half brain betting, would bet JJ single shot perform better 2 doses one mRNA vaccines. data soon enough. depends are, really. Unlike US example, separate states also power lock ones.

Western Australia among normal experience minimal disruption since started. central state/territory (South Australia Northern Territory) also well (NT never confirmed case community transmission ever date).

Even initial wave, East Coast states couple months lockdown thereabouts around late March around June remember.

Victoria get hit badly second wave severe one anywhere country - 112 days ended around October last year, think. believe started quarantine breach get detected time. also around think 750 912 deaths came from.

I think lockdown also function states lock out. Victoria knew eradicate totally lot states would let back in. long probably choice despite pressure that.

I can't speak Victorians second lockdown like overall nation, we've fortunate compared much rest world (I get stuck Northern Beaches lockdown first vacation since January 2020 - could gotten legally virus care technicalities chose stay put 10 days).

As would gotten back - well, also live Eastern Suburbs certainly luck there.

Not able get readily, though - that's understandably big issue lot people.

(Weirdly, life one probably got bit better changes first lockdown - move right near work could walk instead 75-90 minute commute starters.)  Quarantining 100% effective. come contact virus cannot get virus. 

It feasible length time. also recently said women birthing age prevented drinking alcohol. going start slapping drinks women’s hands every turn? line thinking baffles me. whole loss memory thing bunch bullsh*t. side effects well documented. people pissing pants hangover half day fear whatsoever virus itself. understand risk assessment, computing. Delta excavate bungholes sooner later.  good bad. Mostly bad.

This absolutely *not* guarantee. vaccines target spike protein limit much spike protein change still latch cells.

Obviously concerned it. wish everyone ie eligible would get vaccinated. given know happen, need clear-eyed future.

Possibility 1: vaccines might continue work fine, covid continue kill unvaccinated.

Possibility 2: vaccines might lose efficacy (it unlikely suddenly stop working completely), need boosters, Pfizer says make happen &lt;100 days proven distribute rapidly, least US. main catastrophe scenario Pfizer use resources boosters, many desperate need vaccine poorer countries able get resources rerouted US.

All possibilities unlikely. Lol wut? literally opposite this. virus likely spreading China couple months anyone knew existed. Wearing mask hermit two different things. I’ve seen people asking wear mask, guess hard everybody somehow  I've gotten vaccines that's solution, also masks still mandated maybe try passive aggressive insults  US, stand still world still ramping up.

Didn’t Australia deliberately decide stay travel bubble another year developing countries could get vaccinated first? Lmao understand read graph something?

The amount deaths *is proportional amount cases* often hear referred *uncoupled*

Also, PHE data, suggest look up. much, die
Too little, die
breathe it, believe not, die Time world come together beat it! Deaths remain extremely low UK hardly rising due high level vaccination. US already Delta variant like UK would introduce it.

There always new variant.  Everything said incorrect supported available data. really severe fear needles got first dose attempts ( frankly pretty painful tense) tough time getting second dose. hard schedule appointment works around work schedule, already skipped one appointment started panicking hyperventilating leave another. irrational that's problem- can't act rationally room needle. Delta Ultra Mach 3.  get vaccinated then? long force others voting vaccine 100% effective zero side effects. That’s common sense. 

I still think lockdowns likely done US masks may become commonplace, especially service workers could lose 10-14 days work test positive, since can’t work home. Could UK, focused getting first doses many people possible even meant delaying second doses. latest PHE data shows proportional increase deaths relative case numbers

What mean this? mean case fatality rate? think relevant? case, deaths definitely rising: Oh fucks sake.

We’re never going back normal. It’s always going moving goalposts.

I followed every rule proudly. Hell, I’m even wearing mask gym right now. 

But told vaccination available me, signed up. got shots proudly boldly.

That’s exactly delayed June 21st reopening. agree. understand desire go back ""normal"", think CDC's no-masks-for-vaxxed guidance came soon. could waited months people covered, could come much stronger verbiage necessity unvaxxed continuing mask. Also, foolish states public businesses drop mask mandates almost immediately. know several unvaccinated people ditched masks required ""vaccinated"" people, wink-wink. Cringe. Thanks! think it’s important differentiate pro vaccine anti enforced lockdown/mask mandates. shouldn’t lump together different lumping together requires true. Purposefully (potentially) making sick vaccination much better option getting vaccinated potentially risking life around you. Let’s keep Vacc train rolling!!! guess 5-6 times higher says.

I got sick 3 days ago still can't make tests cause labs run reagents. I'm Saint Petersburg - can't imagine nightmare going provinces. Australia, Christmas almost definitely called superspreader event lol. Hardly anyone vaccinated yet. Pretty bad. anyone give shit? I’d bet would basically apocalypse. Cocaine Depends age group, young enough age flu becomes deadlier COVID. CHINA BAD!!!11!!! Based recent studies, majority people get taste smell back, take months. true mild cases permanent damage. may fully get senses back. However, train olfactory senses again. result one study: something taken seriously. losing sense taste inflammation olfactory cleft due common cold. Covid could cause permanent loss senses infecting olfactory neurons. apparently chance retrain senses, positive. Got first one, get second. First one made feel like death hearing 2nd worse? thanks. Pfizer orders Panera

Moderna orders St. Louis Bread Company

Same order tho know, pointing couple days ago said new accelerated programme seems working. seem confident get ahead variant soon. No, not. latest PHE data shows proportional increase deaths relative case numbers, hospitalizations increase marginally.

(/s silly people there) pointed something really important IMO, perspective. own, impact answer question. kids? yet. Immunosuppressed? least. kids, mostly healthy, fully vaxxed? might over. IMO one answer everyone. stop. throwing general assertions without sources, contributing nothing discussion except hysteria.

These facts. Calling 'hysteria' shows ready confront truth danger new evidence vaccinated people getting infected and/or becoming carriers spread? not, point?

Yes. data *you* wildly flinging around. Great News! vaccination rates NL? Oops, started giving first doses 30.... fully vaccinated people might get sick even non-variant COVID. Instead selectively dropping mask mandates vaccinated people such, many people getting vaccine possible. Anyone able get vaccine months still won’t get shot selfish prick, proven safe effective many times. shows spoiled selfish people are.
Vaccines work population-wise. honestly, even take J&amp;J ,you might need mRNA vaccine booster, dont understand dont want 2 jab, end world 100% people drink eventually die.  Thanks thoughts! know vaccines scarce best decision likely take could get, especially able get early year. 

But find early dialogue vaccine differences little vague (probably dissuade people waiting get vaccinated). curious people thought.  CDC played gambler going time vaccination rates high. Little know half Americans still living cult standards refusing get vaxxed matter detriment us all. yeah, jumped gun thinking safe would keep pace vaccines hope correct, fear find another excuse get thing. confident, it’s strong programme. outbreak largely result one dose strategy *just* reached younger adults. It’s timeline issue supply. delayed reopening exactly reason. point even dont risk, still expose people vaccinated fully vaccinated, since fully protected, maybe virus are't symptomatic, endgame Remember everyone like look Florida Texas, look Vegas colorado  Source? impossible based data, news really happened. know got infected? wear masks forever? People die Covid. “In news people die flu.”

Covid transmits asymptomatically. “In news flu transmits asymptomatically”

Are things okay say? No, it’s false comparison Covid much worse. 

It doesn’t matter flu vaccines half ineffective. world won’t change happens. world hit hard that’s true Covid vaccines though. applies. parliamentary institution building England, country UK without one. article referring Parliament United Kingdom Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland. Ok 1 every 40,000+ vaccinated ppl hospitalized w covid. BEtteR gET VacCiNe....

Don't even report stupid shit. tell extremely anxious get second afraid getting sick. end, get really sick second one 24 hours. still it, I'm glad it, hear everyone say bad made feel, understand people get nervous consider skipping second.  tested confirm it’s covid? ask I’m unvaccinated (I’m young Europe able book first appointment Friday, refreshing page 08:59 could book lol) freaking two weeks ago suddenly cold symptoms/a cough smell went, also smelling vinegar curry spices etc. got tested negative. historically often lost sense smell simple cold, even don’t blocked nose. think it’s also semi-common cold symptom. Maybe got tested know it’s covid, I’m also typing anyone else reading curious. Losing smell isn’t directly surefire marker covid.  cannot wrap head around fucking dense people be, pretty much go lick shopping trolley handles want. Twats. ones:

- born 31st December, 2003 (~100,000)

Or

- received letter medical indication (~70,000)

The remainder counts one million people.

Also: Pfizer only, means locations Meppel, Roosendaal Almkerk cannot schedule them, Ridderkerk does. 130 locations offer vaccinations them. bother arguing ""complacent"" trolls here. Anyone exhibits type concern, along 90% epidemiologists, considered alarmist and/or doomsayer. human nature want normality ignore facts lead negative outcome. wants everyone, vaccinated unvaccinated, practice social distancing measures due rise delta variant. also takes seconds exposure cause infection, longer 15 minute threshold. U.S. follows rest world lockdown, easy time.

Also, reports Delta variant evade immunity gained previous infection. possible 32% increase immunity invasion previous infection. Source: statement report: 

""“Delta variant maximum transmissibility yet seen, reduces neutralisation protection previous infections vaccines...""

So correct, signs there, yet many people blinders want over, even present studies. U.S. weeks behind U.K. since U.S. far less vaccinated, currently little 45%, basically defenseless. party want to, trajectory toward winter 2020, time worse due increased transmissibility, infection, death rate. Since younger ages impacted variant, cannot believe schools remain open. 6 feet distancing indoors even logical. variant approaches measles rate transmission.

Keep expressing concerns, ignore say fear mongering. It' nature deny negative events, hence virus still circulating. didn’t feel cardiac effects, went get blood test (for something unrelated) days second shot. markers cardiac CRP super high. doctor said common people recently vaccinated didn’t seem concerned. wonder antivaxxers looked side effects Advil I'm surprised use medication didn’t feel cardiac effects, went get blood test (for something unrelated) days second shot. markers cardiac CRP super high. doctor said common people recently vaccinated didn’t seem concerned. countries hoarding vaccines many times looks hardly possible.. Expect delta gamma theta developing countries. won’t take year make test vaccine new variant. virus mutating doesn’t mean it’s changing completely, limit much change. 

It would mean lockdowns masks again, unfortunately, long. like 5 months later (mine scheduled early September). changes accelerate doses, least Ontario, could change second appointment date go pop up. Mine tomorrow! thing. Happened someone know US another UK. tested negative.

Worrisome part early symptoms Delta cold like. far know 12 17 eligible yet, they? Sheffield today, long least 3 weeks since first give monkeys nuts. 

Interestingly site area high black asian population (around 40%), almost users seemed white 30-50 age group. guess eager get holidays!  currently enough doses storage hit 70% right now. keep jabbing current rate well hit 70% July 31. speed even percent daily average pull even earlier. good position right now. husband fucking died mom, dad sister like wow even sore arm. got Pfizer. Hopefully group parents!!! accidentally sniffed bottle hydrochloric acid high school chemistry. cleared sinuses really quickly.

I still able smell things. Nah, NE good. problems restrictions.  Labcorp offering relatively inexpensive antibody testing, ability request one doctor affiliate They’re wrong oppose restrictions nothing they’re going end them. basically they’re throwing fit street (throwing rattle pram) Oh yeah matter WV uninhabited bit, that's I'm saying helps, chronic pericarditis 4-5 years ago hard time recovering fine Pfizer vaccine. According figures gathered Public Health Scotland published Lancet, least two weeks second dose Covid jabs, protection infection fell 92% Alpha variant 79% Delta variant Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine protection fell 73% 60% respectively reading brief skim sounds like it’s result bacterial pneumonia kidney failure. kidney failure probably caused strain dehydration initial gastritis since compromised preexisting conditions, Covid subsequently contracted hospital.

All paper saying virus effectively neutralized without symptoms wasn’t sterile immunity one dose. nothing altering DNA here, body knew respond Covid vaccine attempted neutralize it. hivemind nonsense, people using brains. maybe try that. say that? People two doses mRNA vaccines protected well delta variant understanding vaccines efficacy reported totally wrong. 95% symptomatic covid study, hospitalization. 

The mortality rate vaccinated people nowhere near 5%. You’re spreading misinformation. 

Can still catch you’re vaccinated? Sure. likely less severe symptoms? Yes. still spread others? certain cases maybe, it’s far less likely. 

Everyone free make minds much risk they’re comfortable don’t fear monger. What's benefit getting 2nd dose already 1st *and* COVID too? didn’t see 94% one shot. Depends strain. Bird flu IFR almost 80%. 1918 pandemic killed around 10%. 2nd shot automatically booked get 1st dose? usually agree hive mind cases not. one guess. don’t care. see downplaying serious situation say something, matter small group people think. feel sorry people Japan.. definitely bad time kind huge events. really wish J&amp;J would let us know risk factors are. “People two shots feel protected” Yep that’s telling us vaccines work fine want get back normal much form partying dining going places mask-wearing problem you? One younger guys work got Covid back end last year still sense smell. think he's going almost 9 months. clearly not. seem one seeing way. please charge big ""booster "" shots, company make money. 

Regards J&amp;J , Pfizer , Moderna , AstraZenca NovaVax shareholder. true 99% people.  88% symptomatic diseases. 79% infections. glad hear that. would spare anyone agony family gone covid. Good luck yours. actually test positive self diagnosed? Thanks explaining way makes sense. I'll use explain people. side effects thing seems map. may luck any. dad's first Moderna dose absolutely kicked ass, side effects second one. partner got Pfizer Moderna respectively side effects first dose, mild effects second, fully resolved within 12-18 hours onset. anxious person totally dreading side effects nowhere near bad thought might be. specific, experienced fatigue low-grade fever, partner experienced fatigue. friends way worse said cleared within day none expressed regret getting shot.

Good luck second dose! protection worth side effects! I’ve researching I’ve read several places get Pfizer sort booster. I’ve made appointment Delta Echo Alpha Delta face chemical variants aren’t theoretical… delta variant already running wild y’all addicted pandemics swear mean get cold!!! Oh no!!! Coronavirus kids!!! Fuck masks People fully vaxxed fine. nothing worry about. odds vaccinated person infecting another vaccinated person COVID literally fraction fraction percent chance. \*lack critical thinking time! Based data UK AZ 90% effective preventing hospitalisation delta variant. works. raw numbers low people use percentages words like ""doubles"", ""triples"", etc. percentages low numbers high tell numbers.

My point, saying ""nearly doubles"" mean much. go 1 2? 500 1000? Lmao, taking sniff vinegar going make lose sense smell good. minerals Marie seems comment contains 1 links hard tap mobile users.

[Here link number 1 - Previous text ^PM ^[\/u\/eganwall](http://reddit.com/user/eganwall) ^with ^issues ^or ^feedback! ^| ^| Damn, good catch. That’s true maybe everything fine people recover greatly quickly line thinking one know (rural south) believes 600k US deaths either. whole vs thing. Wow mention it, interesting pointed out. could sinus infection. Loss sense smell taste symptom. Yes, matches said - 95% people *exposed* virus protected. doesn’t mean 5% people study infected. experience vinegar strokes. Toronto here. Got first dose (AZ) April 16, got appointment second June 29th (Pfizer) - moved orig scheduled Aug 6th. Hoping demand vaccinations fall off, get 80% adults inoculated sooner later. 🤞🏽 place lock downs, stick social distancing, N95/KN95/KF94/FFP2 risky environment.

US already poured billions treatment, sure countries same.

Vaccine, IMO, end game, treatment be. It’s clearly trying downplay situation saying “so what, flu vaccine isn’t 100% either”. see downplaying situation? It’s clearly trying minimize concern comparing flu. flu vaccine fails protect, oh well. mRNA vaccines fail curb transmission, that’s big deal. means pandemic going around lot longer. 

It incorrect irresponsible compare flu Covid vaccine effectiveness potential fallout near future. 

If don’t see serious go tell Israel they’re overreacting. fucking duh. There’s thing 100% effective vaccine.  Everyone know got Pfizer got really sick. Everyone know got Moderna (including family) got sore arm day shots. crazy different side effects are. Really? many people covid year point? It’s many.  Classic extremist playbook: yelling culture wars exist Right we’re talking months particular issue... Poppers People focus way much death side effects; I.e long covid, neurological complications, sense smell fatigue months etc? even something like “long flu”? messed up?! person masked gym, unvaxxed people required masked. dirty looks get--the presumption \*should be\* I'm unvaccinated responsible. I'm vaccinated know good deal people unmasked aren't.  Maybe? don’t know. Things like losing sense smell lasted months people, month could said “why aren’t admitting permanent?” two months later you’d found wasn’t. ""And will""

Counter point: Maybe £250 fine would appropriate? idiot. deserves it! 😂 be. Ideally whole world takes East Asian approach wears mask don’t feel well go out. seriously cut illness way. I’m at, beginning didn’t even think waiting vaccine going necessary. retrospect, clearly there’s nothing left except shut forever fuck that. Pretty sure it’s health theater. There’s much money waste health theater. least fumigation done actually basis science fighting airborne disease. Spraying ground? No. infectious strain becomes, higher threshold herd immunity. best example would measles- considered childhood disease nearly everyone caught time adult. Even then, persisted among children vaccine created. never reached herd immunity without vaccine easy spread. long vulnerable vectors, stuck around.

The infectious variant, unvaccinated playing fire. mutations pass ones easiest pass on- infectious ones. reach high enough point, unvaccinated guaranteed get covid, prolonging entire pandemic. especially brutal people can't get vaccinated respond vaccine, actively trying avoid infection. Sounds like 28 heart issues. pain goes heart arm bad news bears, go get looked at.  Barely restrictions moment compared almost everywhere world. go outside maskless 24h day, go pubs, eat out, go cinema, etc. 

Govt **absolutely** bungled much pandemic, know got post. Chemical also one definition.

No need overly specific. know tomatos actually fruits Vader never said Luke father Steve Buscemi 9/11. hate hospital make decisions based medical science? make matters worse, expect hospital staff same. *""But freedumb!""* think reasonable assume least one person given pharmacy infectious virus kind? interesting part common cold coronavirus, understand it. wonder covid-19 stronger version that. I've covid would rather really bad case flu months deal symptoms covid experienced 3 weeks. Get vaccine antibodies *should* drop three months body transitions active passive immunity. happen healthy people well. surprising explain (or give sheet results without going you?).

B cells confer active immunity, exposure pathogen remain active blood time. prolonged period experience pathogen cells ""retired"" enter passive immunity. B Memory cells created active stage retain instructions creating active B cells need ever arise, however cells captured simple blood test.
Do know *specifically* testing passive immunity? 

It's ingenious evolutionary system allows body respond wide variety antigens without wasting energy resources constantly producing active B cells every single antigen ever encountered. much like library schematics accessed needed. CL final? fans country visited? test long term antibodies. got tested both. That’s fine. still doesn’t mean every time go *pharmacy* there’s 100% chance you’re going exposed something. It’s hyperbole.  God, one gives fuck embarrassed wear mask. can’t deal, stay home 🤷‍♂️ Going post history, you’re straight asshole EVERYONE covid. sound like hurt little boy hasn’t mastered emotions yet. Take hard look inside brother, find you’re mad.. point precautions paused? No.

Specifically indicator would say yes That's true. covid.

Edit: also, even was, point applies hospitalized covid patients. Pharmacies exactly keeping ""covid customers"" separated. fucking PANDEMIC ends! people selfish doesn’t mean isn’t pandemic. tornado coming way walk say fuck tired sitting home? tornados disease don’t give crap end date convenient you. didnt sero convert, 2-10% people fail gain immunity covid vaccine Aren’t supposed close borders new variant arrives? hospital admission, said originally. said ‘effective’, people would assume mean getting COVID all. mean, like anything special except puke 8 months, thanks. never really identified whole survivor aspect. No, allergies suddenly ceased exist replaced COVID! /s  coworker kidney transplant. told continue quarantining despite vaccination. time, 20% developed antibodies vaccine. repeated study, 50% develop antibodies. No, everything's drum people want wear mask they're vaccinated screaming ""fourteen months wasted,"" people *never* actually observed quarantines screamed mask first place. gotten vaxxed see means go back pretend people around dying. That’s absolutely true. Responsible hospitals keeping COVID patients separate, they’re checking ER, ask everyone they’re bc COVID, won’t people reply yes sit room people say no.

I take toddler ER twice last fall/winter feel risk thanks protocols. Congratulations surviving cancer! rock! Depends mean end. cases go low enough, rest world isn’t fire, could see precautions ended, doesn’t mean gone good. cases flare again, bring back easier lighter precautions, increase needed. 

Are point precautions paused? No. Public health measures work there's societal support them.

There societal support kind new lockdown.  Always true every virus ever. Hope ass gets better! Careful. gonna trigger mask maniacs want masking remain forever... get vaccine. I'm talking everyone else.  heard first folks - problems matter they're unique. Mom died? someone else's, asshole! FDA still refused change even clear strategy working (and still time supply issue). arrogance cost many lives. Remember people claimed two weeks ago UK already passed peak terms new cases? level denial wishful thinking around Coronavirus mindblowing. mean, [they covid definitely builds immunity... else would vaccines work then?

Many countries Israel Hong Kong give 1 dose covid survivors they're considered fully vaxxed.

It's like we've forgotten amazing thing called natural immune system

Im fully vaxxed start calling antivaxxer lol    Yeah that’s thinking. think eventually release data since delta strain going dominate news expect well. Glad got mRNA vaccine, really wanted J&amp;J first seems still lag bit terms symptomatic infection. variant able completely bypass current vaccines, would less impossible get world back pandemic mode point. elaborate? I'm curious treatments cold flu would useful covid. mrna vaccines quick adjust understanding. hardest part getting people take them. anybody surprised? There's always going vaccinated folks going sick. sure downvoted. Many countries Israel Hong Kong give 1 dose Pfizer covid survivors they're considered fully vaxxed cursory glance half effective spreader pre-symptomatic asymptomatic, people cause big impact spread unknowingly. People try minimize spread know sick, well, usually certainly will. Well maybe. Hospitalization rate around world what? 3%? 

So 97% chance requiring hospitalization even single dose vaccines reduces even more. 

People becoming comfortable risk. 

I think we're seeing collective acceptance risk around world now. vulnerable age group yet received 2 doses shouldnt traveling. 

Young, good health, dose vaccine? risk low. Give dirty looks back actually interact make sure run away pull gun might wanna cite source studies don’t support claim masks don’t protect aerosolized pathogens what’s point lol What's vaccination % area?  Here's couple extra tables.

We agree disagree pre-2020 plans, think least agree restrictions earlier necessarily mean avoid re-imposing later. start giving us third doses supply US?

Not going lie, felt pretty relieved coming back antibodies maxing testing range. mall recently (Dadeland Mall, Miami), crowded, maybe 50/50 masked. Lots lots people walking around.

It's like past weeks, too.

If vaccinations effective seeing much bigger spike South Florida we've seen. think people need relax numbers show there's significant concern. number totally wrong. even close.  entire family got Pfizer. mum got sore arm. father nothing, two doses. brother little bit tired one day second dose. guess it'll probably vary region, politicized masks been. South? masks sight. Northeast parts West? surprised see significant minority people wearing them.

Personally, wear one -- generally catch many colds/flus, (while recognizing effectiveness) fan masks. said, absolutely judgment anyone continues wear one Maybe likes limited-slip differentials  We're talking app here. course know, that. 

But symptoms permanent (we don’t know yet) big deal many millions people stuck that. Spanish flu killed 50,000,000 + people reason short lived. pre pandemic plans dreadful.  states 70% adults vacinated. county 73% everyone 12 vacinated. 66% whole population. simply enough people vectors. Agreed.

I found interesting - news LA yesterday. Figured worth sharing seeing others thought. Sorry, incorrect well. 'efficacy' percent people get covid vaccinated, percent people got covid able fight without need hospitalization. flu pre-symptomatic phase highly contagious? nope. would let someone defecate mouths thought people hated might smell it. can't get fever over-exhaustion. Exhaustion weaken immune system, making susceptible infection pathogens, body responds raising body temp (fever). exhaustion can't cause fever (unless acute heat exhaustion).

Also vaccine cause fever - means immune system responding vaccine positive thing. fever invalidate vaccine. Masking kept lot ""regular"" illnesses bay past year, shows probably keep anyway. kept talking nobody cares flu deaths, keep down, too, not? US military developing vaccine fight variants, hopefully something good could come that. Hopefully $715B budget use this. Nice cutting analysis /s. Two studies, Pfizer Moderna, robust studies huge data sets, show efficacy almost entirely maintained 6 months vaccination.

Moving on. always order online. Stores area carry them. But, like specific fit mask found online. you. note, they're working ""pan-coronavirus"" vaccine based chimeric Spike protein (i.e., combining features Spike variety different coronaviruses). Besides vaccine COVID (and variants), incidentally [stop viruses responsible 20% common that, targeting viruses responsible common cold probably worth (though knows mRNA tech, suitable targets viruses?) since cause sufficiently severe disease. think would agree less cases COVID good thing.

I believe masks also reduced numbers cases well (perhaps differ here).

So, masks reduced cases, said likely exist many years, anything helped reduce cases would good, right?

What’s cost benefit here? Gently suggesting America still wear masks numbers dipped even extent?  Recommend it’s okay wear masks general numbers historic low? Gotta waft need smell it. Learned chemistry labs. lost sense smell deep whiff dihydrogen monoxide ;-; Yep. One March, one April.  forcing ""forcing"" . People literally locked parts Hubei. managed control 2 months countries civilized enough suffered 15 months. lot think common cold could fatal someone immunocompromised. They’ve always wear ppe stay safe. advocate permanent universal masking public protect them? sudden concern population always mercy rest us seems little disingenuous. miserable life then. Full cold dystopian.  90%+ elderly (75 older) UK vaccinated age range makes vast majority deaths. vaccine older populations, expected lot deaths fully vaccinated, deaths stay lower. labs? Commercial ones too? vast majority world vaccinated? let people still refusing get vaccinated die. 
 
The emotional part wants think that, too. rational part reminds opportunities virus reproduce, opportunities chance mutation, could produce much worse variant. really need everything reduces ability virus reproduce. guess can’t really defend hurl insults refer people. can’t believe you’re downvoted asking simple (relevant) question. sub toxic af. can’t happen. point even bubonic plague made return wouldn’t public lockdowns etc.  wildly successful vaccine book.

No not. one else seems problem understanding person said. keep making shit back lack comprehension. done clearly arguing bad faith. took day work felt sick first moderne, zero affect second shot besides sore arm.   Yep. friend going away dinner right COVID rules relaxed. showed head cold.

A week later I'm sick taking covid test despite vaccinated. take two days work next week kept asked wearing mask anymore.

It's like come on, I'm trying polite safe possible give rest shit kept bed 3 days. Masks work COVID hand sanitizer. use app, it'll could help lot people, immune system unable create necessary amount antibodies, give 3rd 4th dose.

This worked got hepatitis &amp; B vaccine. kind system (or used be, 20 years ago). would give two shots, spread bit, ""most time"" good enough. found could get tested see really immune, asked test, took test found yet immune. went get 3rd shot, waited while, took test yay! immune hep A&amp;B. Exactly. idea paper presented evidence mRNA altering body genes across body parts. fact, paper serves better evidence even one shot vaccine better nothing. unvaccinated US going get vaccinated-- plenty time so.

 proposal vaccinated keep wearing masks end date.

 Continuing wear masks point servers purpose vaccinated people, increase safety minuscule. 

 bunch unvaccinated people die, well natural selection works, part improve species. Yeah, I'm pretty sure reason fer huh....but really subject matter chat. read understood comment fine. There's number factors, starters there's alot talk side effects come second dose honestly bad sure beat getting COVID hooked ventilator. I'll get third fourth dose that's takes want help protect others.

Secondly, Pfizer Moderna vaccines like 75% effective one dose original strain. Problem is, Pfizer 36% effective one dose Delta. People seem realize much transmissible Delta is.   face face contact people.

This one important parts human experience.

You get people avoid amount time, important reasons, absolutely viable long-term solution. 

I note UK, vast majority face-to-face contact *is already much allowed, though.* recommend country removed OUTDOORS mandate (we masks times outside homes) today. streets didnt wear one actual weirdos. country turned stockolm syndrome society mask fanatics, fucking dystopian. HATE hope first day. you’re saying isn’t true. didn’t “just say” vaccines aren’t 100% effective. used flu vaccine example. use something example, pretty equivalent. 

When flu vaccine 50% effective, oh well, nothing really changes. pandemic, mask mandates, nothing ordinary. 

When Covid vaccine 50% effective (I’m saying is, wouldn’t make comparison…), that’s disaster. pandemic lasts much longer, see masking shutdowns whatever. 

It blows mind can’t see this. You’re narrowly focused single interpretation “no vaccines 100%” can’t see really compared here.

It’s like saying “it’s okay tiger bites you, animals bite, cat bite too”.  Isn’t already fact?  listen idiots. Myocarditis happen 1/20,000 young men gets vaccine. even really care? looking something outraged about?  kid late 70s Canada, adults would always complain wear belts, wrinkled clothes breathe right belted in. pretty much universal. moral story ~~don’t~~ travel Florida hang ~~with~~ 10,000 people good. Actually don’t know you’re voted. live New Zealand concerns even though life normal us we’ve lucky here. Compliance EXACTLY holy shit. Mask cold social distancing life. think you’re correct first point. likely shit ton people pre vaccine covid didn’t even know it. Understandable. Last time happened nurse gave snarky comment, something like ""It's always men problems needles. Women much stronger."" *that's* less 100% means. Glad got bottom it. worried I’ve realized it’s “chronically online” take. city almost completely back normal cannot imagine backpedaling considering believe less 100 cases day entire state.

Don’t pay attention WHO. 1. give advice ENTIRE WORLD, recommend isn’t necessarily relevant area even country, 2. they’ve lost lot credibility. I'd love get that. 4 days getting 1st dose got high fever 3 days over-exhaustion (i get regularly every months), I'm sure fully effective. sorry im vaccinated im living without face anymore   you’re supposed scared stay inside mask on! Lol. love : )

PS- drink lot store brand diet cola I'm worst question!  you’re scared, stay home. Simple think shouldn’t focus death first foremost? saying one death worth certain amount long covid cases? find highly immoral, less deaths always outweigh amount long covid. vaccines main purpose never prevent infection

Saying shit get people anti-vax. purpose absolutely prevent infection and, cases occurred anyway, hopefully reduce severity. whole point vaccines reduce spread, done preventing infections. Re-writing history statements makes people paranoid they’re putting inside bodies. stop emphasize vaccines still offer protection. think possible virus completely 100% evade existing vaccine ... entirely possible could see variant vaccines like 30% 40% effective two doses would obviously better nothing far less effective now.

Sure, could get boosters they'd take month two develop months become widely available ... would quicker original vaccine would still take least 2 3 months reach ""anyone get one"" phase. think takeup would high one either. Same. Last Pfizer shot tried think all. like 3 4 minutes later told “hmmmm I’m fine shot” boom hit remembered got vaccine lol  No. spent year last year wearing mask, told mask helps. one cared. Stores didnt enforce them. felt STUPID wearing mask ppl glare me. 

I one maybe dozen ppl time Walmart wearing mask, still am. 

I'm done sacrificing mental health others bothered same. point always compare flu covid. say ""it's flu, bro"" nonsense keep going about. explain vaccines 100% effective. downplaying nothing. explained repeatedly still insist pretending otherwise. really nothing else say matter said over. jeez. reminds horror India back April. Please take care. hope comes back soon! Capers one things could still enjoy, might worth trying like them. not? That's news I'm pretty sure 99% people that's true. always assumed risk fully vaccinated getting mild covid Yup. common sense point. Like wearing seat belt.   Wearing mask restriction lot people pandemic. There's difference wishing someone would die caring not. He's active conservative subreddit. That's why.

In fact already culturally normal many parts Asia Covid. Never said anything wearing mask you’re fully vaccinated. 

I said use common sense keep ear changes virus since it’s yet variants come go. 

If you’re fully vaccinated dont wear mask, fine. get virus, wear one use common sense. That’s it. fear irrational ironic fear wearing masks again. Based moved cross country start pandemic, really exploded. 

I live Phoenix, one biggest hot spots US height last year. wore mask social distanced, got vaccine. Even got WFH job. mental health declined, make friends bc following safety protocols. 

Now I'm vaccinated STILL that? Nah, happening. one cared vaccine available, care I'm vaxxed. 

If I'm vaccinated, ppl see too, dont care. I'm tired sacrificing mental health protect ppl couldnt bothered last year. worries. Next time try clear. Cheers. Pointing nonsense ""harassing people wanting return"". want to, prematurely likely mistake. significant difference caution fear, explained. get it, sick all. isn't? excuse make poor choices. think Florida despite leadership.

More people died needed we're last statistics wise apparently makes ok. chance it'll actually jump vaccine small... Like small. vaccine protects anything looks works similarly...that's point. worst vaccinated folk get sick still die sucks whatever. vaccinated individuals asymptomatic one completely vaccinated die it. absolutes here.  30 percent brain dead population still get vaccine. Go mad WHO. Yeah, there's people comment section advocate mask mandates, long immunocompromised people could get it. Effectively calling perpetual, compulsory mask wearing. realize vaccines suddenly forgot work. got me. Zero fucks given hospitals fill up.

How humane you.  It’s still protective serious cases caused Delta. fair could argue happened later indigenous people's, US founded. It’s World Health Organization. may apply moreso countries. They’re responsibility. life live. absurd I’m tired people like supporting BS highly effective vaccines. Life never risk free. Guys it’s lottery. people don’t die covid. I’m saying it’s okay get vaccinated. I’m saying analogy apt. Yea, read headline thought, huh, that's really bad. First masks, lockdown. I've pandemic year half now, know works Get enough people vaccinated virus millions incubators keep evolving variants in. 

If people masked/distanced gotten vaccinated, would exiting. ""whats exit strategy, tell exactly else I'm gonna act like nothing wrong"" people keep adding fuel fire complaining getting cooler. 

Viruses replicate spread. Every replication chance mutation. Less infected people means less chances mutation. hard. people demanding tell reason fucking over. 

My favorite line months ago ""If new lockdown restrictions interfering social plans, needed new lockdown restrictions"". good hear. Jesus dude, year half still know this? Yes I’m sure that’s true. It’s shame.

Edit add: think epicenter world outbreak March 2020 also plays role compliance mask wearing. Wearing mask mean lockdown, get grip. know, thought said thing masks, opening theatres, concerts etc... soon, capacity lessened least Yea that's true along. reduces chance getting hospitalized significantly well death. don’t want masks still want restrictions. never fly U.S smoking/cigarettes... don’t think that’s root it. think second point accurate... sad is. go shopping, touch doors objects, people touch objects babies children.

It's year half still idiots know transmission works. 🤯 Holy shit mask, that's really difficult wear piece cloth. saying restrictions might good idea keep protecting idiots catch get vaccinated.

I'm asking got first Pfizer shot 13 hours ago feel light heart pain sometimes. know risk low first dose bit worried 2nd jab. even know effective future vaccines Delta, new variants yet emerge.

In vaccinated countries, there's reason think contagious disease less danger future. Whatever way like live permanently, might well live way now. Idk rest world Netherlands, tomorrow measure wearing masks cancelled except u public transport airport.  Pfizer approximately 79% effective (4-5x less effective Delta Covid Classic). AZ bit less. (study done UK) There's also Delta v2 Gamma, neither studied.

Mask vs. one 21%... hmmm... 12 people England died Monday double jabbed.

It's unlikely people 2 doses caught covid enough time passed they've died (covid instantly kill you) 

That number keep rising around world delta keeps mutating, infecting vaccinated people people end hospital.

They still people, parents friends.

You still wear mask care people, bit cloth. different wearing seat belt hard hat. little bit fabric. keep wearing it. I’ve never minded masks they’re nothing, don’t mind this, reasoning? using old data prove point. saying. poster right, job market really hot right now, that's mostly people either moved family changed spending habits, afford financially take risk leaving current job.

Delhi_ — Doctors epidemiologists closely monitoring rise yet another variant detected almost dozen countries, including U.S. Concern so-called Delta Plus variant — mutation [now-widespread Delta first detected India — could infectious cause significant health problems variants prompted Indian officials week label ""variant concern.""

The problem woods' limits clearly defined. know woods? everyone world vaccinated? new variants stop emerging every day? death fall certain threshold? think problem messaging (and governments general) clear endgame, goalposts keep getting moved. month ago target getting X% elligible population vaccinated, seems longer enough.

Im really talking mask burning party type people like previous comment mentioned. vaccine makes *extremely* unlikely seriously ill. mRNA vaccines make extremely unlikely you’ll even get minor symptoms. good dying going hospital good things indeed.

mRNA better though always been. cause concern however. bicycle helmets better others main thing wear helmet. Seattle still haven’t opened up. I’m hoping doesn’t push back longer. Oh wow, mild case WHOLE day!! Golly, almost vaccines attenuated severity symptoms like designed do. Flabbergasted. city population 800,000 people. center metropolitan region 7,000,000. currently 5 covid patients city's hospitals' ICUs. (probably) happened I'm perfectly fine. 100% would get vaccine again. know ever told people need mask. day 1 law wear mask home.

It would help prevent deaths long term illness.

Vaccines make immortal immune, stop infected stop spreading either.
Everybody still wearing mask over. we're far over. might even mutate point vaccines even work we're back square one again. 

There's many idiots power really mind blowing. I’m tired fucking wearing mask, Chris.

Not throw ire way; it’s I’ve spent entire COVID debacle everything credible scientists say. said enough people that, wouldn’t continue wearing one.

To honest, didn’t problem two weeks vaccination. guess it’s baked supposed to, reward would freedom. 

In state mandate lifted it’s asked business don’t put one on. It’s don’t care immunocompromised, it’s it’s enforced wearing mask makes people feel better uncomfortable. doesn’t actually anything much alone, scientifically speaking.  draw conclusions data supports. Pit backlog! Here's full quote article based don’t buy “It’s new, one really knows” excuse.

Tell me, effective decide wear one? 90% effective enough? draw line? I'm genuinely interested perspective 4% difference effectiveness significant. People wear seatbelts still die car crashes. Sometimes people everything right die. sucks, that’s life.  purposes immunology, important distinguish interferon types specific functions lot people knew wearing mask good idea way CDC recommended I'm gonna thanks trying Everyone one home like thermometer. tired this, looks like never end right imo. seems rhetoric aimed countries aren’t nearly well US Europe, completely understandable. countries using Pfizer understand it’s 15-20% pop vaccinated, still makes sense wear mask. scare us know someone refuses get vaccine simply he's heard rumors zeroes sperm count.

More 177 million people received least one dose COVID-19 vaccine United States, CDC continues monitor safety COVID-19 vaccines health problems happen vaccination.

Since April 2021, thousand reports Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) cases inflammation heart—called myocarditis pericarditis—happening mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) United States.

These reports rare, given hundreds millions vaccine doses administered, reported mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, particularly adolescents young adults. View latest information.

CDC partners actively monitoring reports, reviewing data medical records, learn happened understand relationship COVID-19 vaccination.

Most patients received care responded well treatment rest quickly felt better.

Confirmed cases occurred:

Mostly male adolescents young adults age 16 years older

More often getting second dose first dose one two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines

Typically within several days COVID-19 vaccination

Patients usually return normal daily activities symptoms improve. speak doctor return exercise sports.

CDC continues recommend COVID-19 vaccination everyone 12 years age older, given risk COVID-19 illness related, possibly severe complications.

Getting vaccinated best way help protect family COVID-19.

Should Still Get Child Vaccinated?

Yes. CDC continues recommend COVID-19 vaccination everyone 12 years age older, given risk COVID-19 illness related, possibly severe complications, long-term health problems, hospitalization, even death. child already gotten first dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccine, it’s important get second dose unless vaccination provider doctor tells get it.

The known potential benefits COVID-19 vaccination outweigh known potential risks, including possible risk myocarditis pericarditis. Also, patients myocarditis pericarditis received care responded well treatment rest quickly felt better.

If concerns COVID-19 vaccination, talk child’s doctor, nurse, clinic.

Also city made big budget pass get lot jobs back running city jobs hire/bring back workers. Going back would result colossal economic collapse. someone works early childcare settings frequent contact children can't vaccinated ( I'm vacced up, adult family members work mixed bag none children work eligible vaccination).  suspect masks long term thing learn transmission kids. move multiple classrooms family homes constantly worry small possibility could spread virus. I'm worried catching myself, seems know enough kids (who constant snot, colds, able practice good hygiene, etc) spreads. I'm washing, hand sanitizing masking everyday move contact large varied number children families.  also breathed oxygen drank water, WE'RE GOING DIE.  Current recommendation CDC ""yes, Booster need timing COVID-19 booster doses established. additional doses recommended rapidly evolving situation, CDC ACIP starting talk boosters.

J&amp;J running dual-dose trial; others running mix-and-match combo trials booster trials.  8-12 months, quite likely bunch trials reported generated new recommendations regulators. That’s certain. event, it’s going full approval argument disappear. Catholic Church would like word. asked person source earlier given nothing either. actually received source anyone I've asked lol. I'm even trying prove otherwise, want see it! delta variant worried about. times virus mutate worse get. Recent studies shown COVID circulating early winter 2019 first left China holiday rush since tested easily blends variety conditions (Flu, Pneumonia, coronary conditions, ect), know. I'm masks wearing mask glasses fucking annoying amount people medically unable get vaccine extremely small number. I’m sorry, sucks society can’t function bend backwards every issue effects 0.1% population. Honestly seem like every week seems change minds. 

Either way. I'm immunocompromised I'm taking mask long time word J&amp;J's effectiveness? That's one got. I'm trying gauge much need worry. Iirc, mRNA vaccine makers stated could, needed, updated boosters sometime later year tackle new variants. mRNA tech bit like Lego viruses quickly rolled out. testing approval process dramatically shorter, letting companies pump hundreds millions shots, even billions, within couple months begin crafting vaccines.

Someone correct got wrong, would hate accidentally spread misinformation. woods, infact UK rates rising drastically mo. 

Additionally, vaccine takeup UK high compared western europe. Fuck kids annoying  mean, that's reasonable, kids 4 5 really struggle masks. 

Also, minors control medical decisions, lot kids might want vaccinated whose medical care dictated anti-vaxxers covid denialists, that's unfortunate say least.

It's easy say rates infection among children low, considering increased prevalence virulence Delta variant abysmal vaccination rates areas (one [fully vaccinated] relatives lives backwater burg 30% vaccination rate moving upward anymore), hard conclusively say risk acceptable. 

The playing field changing rapidly. 

Sometimes get sick masks, too. explained (fully vaccinated) family although unlikely present significant danger others since even get it, would hopefully high enough viral load spread it, there's really point testing theory real life, since masks *that* onerous.

Personally, I've monitoring rates new cases area, they're high last summer, we're going wait circulating pool Rona community little lower stop wearing masks. 

Honestly, past year quarter shit. really feel like crashing two feet finish line point. Placing bets people wanting wear masks time.  people old don’t comorbidities? Yes, is. Risks everything do. I’d already decided I’m wearing mask while. covid it’s fun. Plus I’ve lost many friends I’d rather die well. 25% population US never get theres chance “Vaccine alone won’t stop community transmission,” Simao added. “People need continue use masks consistently, ventilated spaces, hand hygiene ... physical distance, avoid crowding. still continues extremely important, even you’re vaccinated community transmission ongoing.”

Sounds like wants everyone keep locking still thinks zero transmission somehow attainable goal, mask. Helping cause got 2nd dose Ontario minutes ago. Pfizer first got Moderna second since Pfizer reserves 18 we'll see fkes drove 2700 miles California Colorado. Utah spiking see one mask either Nevada Utah. also got cold. I'm thinking going get testing kit, even though I'm fully vaccinated. Delta virus big Colorado God everywhere. think might go back mask, easy say 6'6 guy someone make fun of. Mask shaming insecure shit ever. yea i'm listening Lol kids aren’t good vectors covid. Stop buying hysteria fear mongering. Jesus Christ people stupid. first vaccine trials year ago. long term effects would apparent known now. happened; side effects mostly mild short-term.

He get vaccinated, period. Oh worries., good. know isn’t going convince people get vaccinated? Telling still follow restrictions whether vaccinated not. seems messaging aimed countries aren’t well Covid unlike US. Yeah F that. I'm asymptomatically spreading anti-vaxxers care. thanks   seems like they’re saying publicly countries low vaccination rates even though said general terms. make sense keep wearing masks country 15-20% population vaccinated even vaccinated. Fuck, somehow hit add comment leaving vaccine. caught finished edit. use reddit information saying restrictions

Not yet might good idea keep protecting yourself

I am. That's got vaccine. recken 3-4 weeks seeing affecting transmission combined wasted effort trying enforce they'll scrap two buds double shot Pfizer Covid right intense symptoms. 
Not trying prove anything one way another, telling something know certain. 
That said internet stranger even saying probably going fall deaf ears.   Well there's 1 place might able go August least Madeira gets canned Masks prevent people breathing virus.

Some do, don't. weaken immune system long run. issue people wearing masks, especially sick. Small quantities / Minor exposure bacteria strengthens immune system. literally terminated video call Taiwan mentioned? They've proven compromised pandemic. Current research shows j&amp;j reaches level efficacy mRNA 49 days post vaccination. hard find articles sample size lower vaccines numbers positive, positive what’s getting reported. TBH really bad messaging entire pandemic taking account regional differences making broad blanket statement would brand  we’re least approaching tail end vaccinations real end. something always live with.  friend’s grandfather contracted covid nursing home California three days scheduled get vaccinated. died couple weeks later. Got call friend say goodbye turned oxygen. 

It’s still painful them. people live circles friends probably know two people close proximity would shared among them. personally know 1 died, dad hospitalized it. Seeing 7 degrees enough connect everyone planet, makes sense.   Ok would win fight? Lmfao Oh Sub isn’t going like this. CDC reissues guidance masks sub may catch fire. Yep.
Fully Vaccinated since May (and unmasked last month) friend mine busy retail job caught covid tested positive last week. unpleasant cold symptoms. wonder Delta variant, found state.

Makes glad staff (also retail) stayed masked building longer required it.

We don’t want covid, even it’s mild case - really don’t want spread hordes unvaccinated kids get. Though sympathy unvaccinated parents. gonna happen. No.

I wearing mask unless 100% proven vaccine resistant strain out. think it’s “we need hit critical mass vaccinated population want get crazy train, expect keep worked vaccines slow spread indefinitely.” exactly. I've seen many comments past year people saying ""we need date, time frame"".

Six eight weeks. That's long CDC virology experts told us would take wore masks, stayed home, followed strict quarantine protocol. Six eight weeks.

For part, people said ""No."" started screaming freedoms politicizing health crisis.

And are. two friends right sick double vaccinated Pfizer feeling pretty crappy moment call severe symptoms. I'm expert, understand could like happened Polio little people infected (and risk new infections low) disease declared ""eradicated""... anti-vaxxers came skipping vaccine resurfaced again.

I see something similar happening covid, time little infected, even taken care taken measures infect others (quarantine/masks) virus die able spread others. requires people follow rules cooperate, know turns out...  feel like you’re anti-maskers getting self-righteously wearing mask.  always greater good wear mask though. Well CDC American regulatory agency actual authority set regulations US

The eternal United Nations problem ""I can't make anything, please listen us"". Can’t wait Philly reinstate SAH. Living feeling like normal human past weeks getting much, worried second bars restaurants neighborhood would survive *not replaced Starbucks’ Amazon locker stations seriousness though, somewhat page. hard enough getting people listen info, expect listen contradictory statements though? They'll say fuck it. MUST vaccinate entire world stop virus. Developed countries need ramp production start shipping developing countries get shots every adult arm Earth. Hope well now. We're scaremongering, really happening really. Can’t talk rest world Spain least, they’re getting born 80-82. that’s population younger 38 able get vaccinated yet (which big percentage)

To put perspective:


100% people older 80 years vaccinated

98-96% people 70-79 years old vaccinated

93% people 60-69 years old vaccinated

86% people 50-59 years old vaccinated


So could, got vaccine. rest (which bulk population) progress can’t get yet


It’s frustrating  Governments particularly save lives well vaccinated countries, suppress infection rate much possible. help reduce infectious spread globally across country less vaccinated areas also reduces chance virus mutating. takes single mutation virus makes vaccine ineffective planet practically back square one, every single infection chance create mutation. good example current Delta variant already 8 times contagious due mutations first strains 

That's government playing safe I’m asking it’ll over.

When herd immunity. no? specify country origin said variant sick CDC announcing things early. aunt uncle complaining college sending cousin fee testing covid every weeks come quarantine plan came contact somebody Covid. None vaccinated. uncle pharmacist.   Yeah contact tracing + testing means get kicked Olympics someone entourage gets too. smart. differentiate original comment, edited remove mention this. original comment indeed foolish. doesn’t even look like read paper linked.

This stupid argument, longer partake in. Good day. feel like I'm one people still wearing mask public. Even though I'm vaccinated know yet feel safe. think many people wouldn’t want take risk AZ choices. 50% what?? averaging less 100 cases day Covid. Stop intentionally manipulative stats. I’m genuinely interested understanding position. masking upsetting (not sure that’s right word)?

I really see mild inconvenience worst, I’ve yet find someone willing humour explain they’re opposed them. xenophobic? tells variant is

you think people avoid saying indian variant covid, rather us variant?

no offense, that's kinda nonsense imo, people much free time hands nowdays one immune suppressed person dad, go say “I insurance cannot recall SSN” get another vaccine. today. It’s insane people like father, myself, bilateral lung transplant aren’t tested antibodies given boosters/managing meds good outcomes. treated like able bodied person ignorant also dangerous, new variations come people exposed *especially* immune compromised people covid survive long inside bodies, possibly mutating whole time. Ooorrr. Everything is, been, continue fine Isnt avoiding surveillance key priority many? would absolutely oppose another mask mandate. Strongly oppose I'm fully vaxxed. I'm pretty sure I'm one. 

With said, majority ""anti maskers"" getting upvotes could well fully vaccinated myself. point must accept risk life. life put hold anti-vaxxer? Yes understand can't get legitimate reasons tiny outlier would always position.

I'm sorry, I'm going back masks anymore unless I'm sick symptoms.

There way accept risk. Plus mild infection might provide good, lasting natural immunity gained previous infection, jabs give much certainty level protection produced boost protection gained previous infection. Spanish flu ended, terms social distancing 1920 virus never “The 1918 flu still us, sense,” said Ann Reid, executive director National Center Science Education successfully sequenced genetic makeup 1918 influenza virus 1990s. “It never went away.” [...] “The flu viruses people get year, last year, still directly related 1918 ancestor.” live time, where, first time ever, vaccine pandemic undergo, after. 

But, many patogens, viruses, bacteria depend on, cant live without even us, bacteria us human cells 8% genome actually virus dna: US, decision made early going federal vaccine passport system, tracked. suspect something wanting higher vaccine uptake (there certainly population would get vaccinated they'd tracked result), that's suspicion.

Dude we're talking WORLD health organization. think everyone around world taken OP Phizer Moderna vaccine? vaccines like J&amp;J less 80% effectiveness? people Russia took Sputnik vaccine?

Not vaccines created equal, yes, Delta variant control vaccinated people areas need continue wear masks.

Finally, comments getting upvotes people ""just want over"" would oppose mask mandate. Nothing vaccines people. course everyone get vaccine, thats small percentage. Much smaller percent unvaccinated people. everyone people literally cant got it, would solve lot problems one person wear it, everyone else's masks fail work? I'm shocked ... absolutely shocked! literally understand still wear mask.

Some people CANNOT get vaccinated even would love to. I've already Covid. sucked. got shot, got sick times. sucked. even need discuss (beyond desire help them)? you’re 18, get vaccinated guess avoid subject (sad effective). It’s amazing fast went trumps fault individuals fault. Reddit working fine. keep saying Biden needs offer $1,000+ stimulus check qualified last one conditioned 80% Americans fully vaccinated.

No hysteria cases vaccine works preventing hospitalisation.

There always variants. Always. Even vaccinated people carry virus. There. Will. Always. Be. Variants. I’m literally position heart skipped beat read title. Hopefully it’s coincidence nothing serious lot sure everyone got vaccine wore masks would solve problem like 70% do. That's non-debatable. Don’t like build pipeline, tests etc? Better safe sorry, probably best call right now. Ok, paper specifies IFNβ. What’s problem? still saying it’s “foolish”? one certain percentage people follow rules. enough people matter many vaccinations develop. still enough idiots generate new variants. anyone want wear mask?

For now, you’ve fully vaccinated:

You still need follow guidance workplace local businesses.

You resume activities without wearing mask staying 6 feet apart, except required federal, state, local, tribal, territorial laws, rules, regulations, including local business workplace guidance.  Thank confirmation yes, still need masking though fully vaxxen since May. Effectively calling perpetual, compulsory mask wearing.

I think least public transport, museums big gatherings eg tourism pilot:

- amount tax wasted public health care cause shit breath coal burning cars driving around 
- people clean hands, sneeze cought without covering mouth
- we've pretty much eradicated flu, want back? Florida, need say would fucking business updates took 48 hours implement. Sheeeesh Same. entire social circle. Double vaxxed I'm going life. point accept risk lives.

… Ah shit, go EVERY what? Politician? yeah would agree that. I'm saying good thing, I'm saying going back masks here. I'm fully vaccinated usually still wear mask. I'm vast minority. Damn that’s shitty luck. guess vaccines 79% effective stopping infection, 95% stopping “serious illness”  sounds like vaccines work they're telling wear mask. know telling us? Florida? uphill battle even before.

It help virus first hit news outlets spread lie protect you. Much sooner that. Check song Baba O'Rily it'll change mind. Andalucía Spain need wear tomorrow.. still wearing mine though, kinda like tbh also make anyone without vaccine ask “why bother” agree, ready cases mimic UK soon Well that's remarkably silly. fact people avoid preventive care general (such poor homeless) public cost much higher. applies covid way applies heart attacks, drug alcohol abuse diabetes. Lmao wtf source year ago? Cases going up, admissions deaths well even previous best case scenarios. Compared models less 10% previous waves.

Vaccines broken link cases severe symptoms. need supply get people stabbed. yeah. get infected unvaccinated.

I bet r0 calculated vaccinated population, r0 would less 1, even worst variants.

The r0 unvaccinated much higher 1, lower vaccinations vaccinated stops unvaccinated spreading germs.

This epidemic kept going unvaccinated. Even without taste, people touch salad last type food left universe realize accusing exactly doing. Focusing specific things argue, entire context sentence (ignoring said really) providing evidence back claims. That's fine. would, however, suggest taking caution new variants. CDC say concerned, need wait exact peer review chart want see wearing mask practicing social distancing. many scientists agree something, whether cited Guardian, Forbes, WSJ, NEJM, life choose ignore it. choices impact others. wait last minute take appropriate action.

Also, whether said ""unlikely"" ""impossible""...and? Using argument fallacy prove people wrong rather ignorant. recommend make argument, consider issue large. allows much better clarity debate. vaccine one hundred percent effective. 

Nobody ever claimed were. They're still effective even they're know effective vaccines Delta variant

We actually know that, plenty links sub recent days highly effective particular variant, take look sometime. Covid deniers generally older, 35+ crowd New York city :

Signing contracts great PR, comes getting vaccine approved country (more great PR) Sputnik showing somewhat higher lists state many countries using vaccine (more great PR). 

But is. PR exercise. production capacities quality control really deliver. I'm personally waiting luxury premium package, includes weekly shots, super effective, i'll get mail, protects newest strains there, kinda like weekly biological updates comment say anything disputes said? insert commas random? necessary pre-vaccines ardent masker enforcer masks. 

But wear greatly improve quality life, social connections, let’s events happen easily. watching Dublin. anti lockdown thing? Thank you! Also I’ve seen comments vaccines before, appreciate gathering articles everything like do. genuinely helps stay informed, really appreciate it. flu way worse covid. know, government actually something pandemic instead letting selfish, reckless idiots whatever hell wanted allowing variants spread, could done this. 

Anyway, where’s next stimmy? 54 % increase cases last 7 days. Similar numbers Portugal. 

My prediction 30k cases per day 14-20 days True, far far lower previously seen past infection rises. Infections admissions also much focused younger unvaccinated. 
 
All link cases severe symptoms broken. three main modes government response COVID:

1. Proactive keeping contained. New Zealand Australia (pulling get together OZ).

2. Reactionary. Watching happens counties, wait see, waiting seeing long Alpha, Gamma Delta make shores see whole thing unfold second time. contained countries, blew chance last year.

3. Small enough death rate bad sort contained, perhaps luck (Vietnam last year). going “live it.” Singapore model unveiled. Hoping work them.

I guess Brazil 4. comment than, pray people there.

The spectrum plenty counties those. cases, proactive vaccine role out, things still got hand, Chile comes mind. That's disingenuous poor reading part. article discussing routine vaccination general, covid vaccine specifically. really wonder exactly supposed look incredibly poor country.

That's mean ""reasonable"" assume. goal get sick, I'm going assume places sick people likely are... well.. likely sick people places. common sense. people still refusing get vaccinated die.

I mean, got COVID last July, I’ve also following rules since beginning. symptoms milder common cold, didn’t experience long-term effects all, I’ve declined vaccination body clearly doesn’t need taught fight virus.

Assuming suffer myocarditis first shot, rational believe 2nd shot may even worse? despise it.

These people never gave fuck I'm supposed lean suck generously acting behalf. prominent ""lab"" theories supposing virus genetically engineered, I'm sure seems conflating ""from lab"" ""genetically engineered"" I've also heard getting two doses opposite arms might help reduce risk unpleasant/mild side effects. Also, highly suggest pedialyte/gatorade (electrolytes) hours leading jab, since many people told helped them. end day, worst that's likely happen feeling kind crummy day two (this coming fellow Moderna recipient). Anyway, best luck! acting nuanced nothing protest detracting real issue here.

We lot freedoms compared places less compared places that's moot point.

There curfews bars asked quarantine return free travel another moot point.

Nobody asked opinion masks inside commented usefulness Vs pointlessness.

100k events norm, exception norm. Moot point.

Stop looking exceptions rules back half cocked argument accept bit hand anti Vax rhetoric people lean on.

Or don't. pretend sake correct. used cancer patients. safer chemotherapy high bar. broadly used comparatively little data next vaccines use.  Keep mind new articles came day ago true ""who statement"". Dr Mariängela Simão said stuff media briefing. said masking, ventilation, measures necessary control pandemic, ""when community transmission ongoing, case Latin America"". ""a high level continuous community transmission""
Consider community transmission rates area.
Also statement mandate care. Happy roll dice AZ. want lifestyle back It’s always simple. Finland hardly cases bringing back high number infections. think great filter civilization?  sound like kid watched documentary space thing recently learned new word think know means. existential crisis human species. would great filter virus like death rate like this. Maybe spreading globe killed 9 10 people span 7.7 billion people, yeah would give credit great filter comment.  that’s case won’t ever be. didn’t invent antimatter warp drive shit explode entire solar system; virus that’s control time future. Go smelt iron. 
The end game stay safe possible significant amount population vaccinated. Also, uncharted territory, trials vaccines conducted precautions like masks place. delta variant also exist trials. sucks is. end game vaccines acting like threat exists 50% population vaccinated stupid be. Seriously? headlines going stop? Everyone knows fully vaccinated people get sick. point time let go. going scare antivax morons getting vaccination. read everything idea Finland-Russia border closed since March 2020. Finland allowed happen hard understand. True, however take look rise hospitalisation see lagging lot compared first second wave, due vaccines point government say “ok point vaccinated problem, moving on.” yes understand people cannot get vaccine health related reasons mean cmon point give. come back weeks. even that, there's huge demographic people ditched shitty work commutes kept cushy salaries, made massive gains tech stocks. Lol sweet get sick every virus encounter. crowded? don’t understand people. Pfft... second lockdown would forever. 

Frankly, it’s one things would make dent getting rid good. 

Sometimes, suck up. help cringe little folks even spell Immunocompromised COVID suddenly became biggest ""advocates"" they're seen useful pawn online debates.

A lot folks never blinked 20-30k dead flu every year apoplectic folks walking around without mask even they're vaccinated ""the risk absolute zero"". Meanwhile went jobs sick hacking half lung 2019 even thinking little old lady walked them. Yeah I'm fully vaccinated live Mexico city shit still control mask public avoiding congested areas indoor spaces mostly. keeping social circle small still. friends who've able go states also fully vaccinated even really started people 40 yet city. US health insurances cover this, believe. pretty crummy insurance haven’t pay anything antibody test Covid tests vaccines…. I’ve gotten tested 5 times blood test done twice last year. Ammonia actually knock cold. wrong looking bigger picture. point vaccine find sustainable balance reducing eliminating COVID-19 deaths hospitalizations, social economic interest returning pre restriction status quo.

Reducing symptoms helps. Reducing transmission helps. Fortunately shots both. either job perfectly, well enough accomplish goal, massively reduce global human suffering due COVID. r/ANormalDayInBrazil relevant vaccines. I've seen people saying wear mask table bathroom.... like that's going good sitting table shoving food maskless face hour between. meant response that's usually goes.

Rather sarky there.

Ciao x  There's curfew. go like quarantine coming risky places. Masks public indoor areas sure exempt, (ooooh hardship!). 10000 people went Download last weekend, 60000+ Latitude couple weeks. I'm saying restrictions low compared many countries, agree all, LOT freedoms compared many.

And suspect there's large overlap anti-vaxxers ""freedom!"" crowd, groups highly contrarian. watched video comment mask wearing , ventilation, etc made lot sense context. tends happen lot statements actually.

WHO always taking account entire world, including low resource countries . Dr Mariängela Simão talking crushing pandemic worldwide bringing Latino America example (BTW, Dr Mariängela Simão Brazilian give perspective). definitely understand under-resourced country like Brazil, much community transmission, able get vaccination rate US has, etcetera think context viable tell people important everyone mask. 

So coronavirus situation.... Ask yourself, community transition are? tell county US, currently mask mandate, community transmission rate much lower Brazil, vaccination rate higher, health care resources available.

I thought we'd put bed idea virus genetically engineered well year ago. while. Unfortunately lower tier casual two jobs. finished I'm unemployment benefits. tough I'm earning 25% used to. goes rent. try hold savings

Meanwhile dinner family last night. went WFH careers. Mostly living life normal impact financial situation hyperbole. Don’t take personally. ever go back wearing masks 😢 sure hope variant resistant vaccines 😔 We'd fucked really, makes trust WHO. Ignoring mass human suffering would cause short term, agree might silver lining people would point hundred years look back era. Regardless, variant covid deadly enough major impact regard (so far least). said, doubt last event like lifetimes, buckle up, may well wished monkey's paw lol!  point trust anyone anymore mad people still wearing masks getting vaccinated. 

Kids threw food fight cafeteria closed. mad people made space unusable. Instead lashing people close space. That's leave. WV one states shrinking population. That’s ok. I’ll take chances. thanks :) long continues spread widely. 

These variants already chipping away slowly vaccine efficacy. longer virus circulates, mutates, chips away vaccine efficacy. Try Covid Delta, less death sneeze! food poisoning caused meat gets transmissible diseases said ban meat. Oh neat. 😠 Catching covid would much worse  sorry hear father, appreciate posting this. husband got J&amp;J vaccine March, also takes biologic weekly (Humira). 

I may suggest get tested see antibodies. Exactly, agree more.

From WHO'S perspective also stand lose significant amount attention probably funding pandemic everyone stops paying attention them. vested interest make sure people remain fear long possible. Vaccinated people also catch covid. always variants. Always.

I understand escaped people's logic. Covid around forever dangerous vaccines job stop serious covid, stop catching Same. vaccinated, still wear mask ""did part"" year. quarantined, isolated, masked up, vaccinated.

I'm done wearing masks. employee says something one me, I'll put store make rules, I've done part fellow neighbor. us everything supposed getting lives going bring next apocalypse, ones never cared get vaccinated would done without me. Well fun 5 minutes. subject normally comes first, unless preceded device transition subject another one...*which case completely lacking*.

It kind effort help understanding writing, I've long stopped caring. Bye. huge population feels certain way trying change way feel difficult.

How arguing that? simple fact. agree see cause problems.

Please short sighted reactionary. Look come tell antimaskers even vaccine people need wear them.

If snapped we'll certainly see coming up. agree getting people vaccinated good exit strategy.

However, lot parts US, seems though people gotten vaccinated going to. problem. problem me. I've got immune compromised people home, I've kept mask even vaccinated gone referring guy saying likely die vaccinated  vaccine reduces chance needing hospitalization covid, prevent getting spreading it. Delta doubling every 2 weeks US. also also: Vaccines UK 14,000 lives saved 44,500 kept hospital.

Edit source: fraction similar infection rates before. think little bit unfair propose father hard time everyone perpetual lockdown. feel bad dad, completely unrealistic entire world sacrifice much well year pretend everyone else suffering live like this. said feel bad dad, going go along route need take everyone's feelings consideration. real? store work almost none customers wear masks, numbers match vaccination numbers. Hell, went get vaccine went grocery store pharmacy. two people ahead maskless, since vaccine definitely supposed be. takes guts blazing past fully vaccinated customers wear mask sign maskless way vaccine. Making things honor system year people showing selfish entitled terrible idea. Jesus christ take sub's layman discussions complex issues surrounding medicine sociology regarding world wide pandemic personally, would realize post snarky way say hate kids. Sorry hear that, got sick second shot well.

You could get reinfected covid vaccine 100% effective strains. could carrier spread can't / vaccinated young recommends still wearing mask even getting vaccinated. Humanity way go pandemic behind us! Israel. Like half symptoms... I've got idea hysteria Oh boy thing people US could reliably comply first place used carrot get vaccinated, also worked less successful hoped, going thing again? covid vaccinated sub really awful too. Lots unsourced conspiracy shit getting thrown around there. Anyone still trusting ANYTHING (or lying charlatan Fauci) say fucking idiot. People need research reliant narratives including Dr. Fauci total asshole purposely trying harm people. dying low number need live Continued maintenance mask wearing community prevalence COVID targets would, fact, stop people dying. we’re currently society borderline negligent, equivalent unbuckling seatbelt car still moving. Unless understand incorrectly, effectiveness section listing asymptomatic symptomatic infections reduced around 80 - study general population Israel conducted 17 January 6 March 2021, time Alpha variant circulation dominant variant, found Pfizer vaccine reduced asymptomatic COVID-19 infections 94% symptomatic COVID-19 infections 97% Obviously works best everyone wears mask. mask absolutely protect individual group maskless people. far perfect, especially medical grade one we're talking cramped indoor environment, definitely better nothing.   covid almost completely harmless children.  conspiracy theories true. Government likes control one way another , left right center go different ways Government officers clue regular people live. live bubble. made many stupid assumptions. Well since ""exit strategy"" truly protects (and can't get vaccinated) table, kind answer expect? I’m nurse vaccinated since January, I’m tired masks. I’ve encouraging everyone part ensuring wear mask got out, even CDC says don’t (to point), even I’m tired masks. sympathetic vaccinated don’t want wear masks, unfortunate is. stat bullshit poor way represent population risk fucking pandemic moron. get cut higher risk individuals say ""nothing see here!"" Makes think even bother getting vaxxed... Group incentives rather individual ones US? Doesn‘t fit view country 1918 one lasted 3 years, halfway behaves same, shorter since connected Where-ish located? thanks going give anti Vaxx people ammo.

If vaccinated people can't stop wearing make never going happen.

Not wearing mask good insentive people still shot. they're compete.

it's reasonable.

1 million chance might high trained entire life. doesn’t change point. We’re never going able stop people people dying. know edited comment? didn’t change anything substance interferon statement, far remember. believe either edited minor typo added question Gupta paper.

Your ego inhibiting ability rational conversation. want say comment “foolish” apparently refuse acknowledge legitimate research around issue. think talking ass dismissive want avoid acknowledging it. vaccinated nothing worry about.

This announcement made general intent protect everyone, vaccinated not. fails account reasons people may vaccinated not, fails account emotional social burden, well economic burden associated perpetual social distancing lockdown lifestyle. anything announcement makes doubt credibility intentions WHO. went route try prevent panic buying believe (obviously work, like they've never seen American public), realize people could spread virus effectively remaining asymptomatic time. 

For second point, apparently thought people felt sick would stay home work activities en masse, therefore one virus would spreading people. almost incomprehensibly naive stupid. like people CDC aliens never actually met human being, let alone average American. many us even get sick days...not sure thought going work out.

Regardless even mattered president driven proverbial car cliff start pandemic. federal government could easily ensured enough masks PPE produced given needed them, preferred politicize profit American deaths suffering. Yeah, I’ve notified recently uni I’ll make sure spread word. covid recently wait 30 days till get vaccinated I’ll get done ASAP. still wear masks what's point vaccine? vaccine protect us covid not? So, vaccine useless. Haha glad passed that. celebrate every holiday live bands, great food, dancing even wheelchairs walkers. truly love do. I’m fully vaxxed killing people I’m spreading Covid. Wow. things read Reddit beyond comprehension. lose extra wasn’t simply referring anti-VAX. lots parts world haven’t even opportunity get vaccine. option get vaccine literally continue along Covid precautions, they’re going far less motivated get vaccine. I'm fully vaccinated cases plummeted. I'm living like 2019. I'm remarkably little risk, I'm serious risk vector, I'm sure people think end goal we're allowed, mind, decide small level risk small enough we're gonna go life. wish people would get vaccinated, can't make hiding away wont get us closer herd immunity. Legit lol'd asked fully vaccinated people wear masks again, think variants making things worse. think would say passenger wearing seatbelt dies crash “at fault”. parent comment asserted people dying COVID point forward fault, that’s sentiment post objected to: vaccines aren’t perfect, it’s possible someone vaccinated still die disease community transmission levels still high. use seroprevalence estimate total number infections.

On hand, infections unreported and/or asymptomatic, PCR tests false-positives false-negatives, making CFR essentially meaningless. Metronidazole works trichomoniasis well gum infection. Shouldn’t rule tend use something else. realise 80% planet vaccinated right? think that's they've chosen to? Duh live recently last week invited book jabs, earliest appointments around late June. think good news, I'm sure. Listen CDC.

The CDC authority United States well vested interest priorities country. account many countries real authority set rules. rate may well release statement saying best way prevent deaths go outside sit house nothing general. think (at least live). anti-vax bother, political statement based distrust institutions. Title unrelated article posted. rant masks. western countries start donating vaccines poor countries billions pretty sure moderna pfizer offered around 95% protection symptoms clinical trial 100% fatal 16-80+ year old group

Those clinical trials started 2020, wild-type virus dominant strain. we're mainly dealing Alpha Delta variants, numbers indeed changed bit. take away perhaps don’t reopen schools unvaccinated kids? Damn! Beat it! …I think 🤔 friends excuse is, yes stupid, ""I want DNA changed want kids eventually""

Don't get started. target day one many locations cases fewer 25 per 100,000 per 14 days, combined low deaths hospitalizations. still reasonable goal, indexing relaxation restrictions that, rather moving goalposts relax milestones people impatient. I'm fully vaxxed point I'm starting think conspiracy theorists right all... they're never gonna let us go back way things before. keeping us fearful control Trump downplayed severity virus time time time part blunt impact thing, people wanted stay safe cautious mercy didn't. vaccine, that's case anymore. actually choice whether protect way before. 80% world's population vaccinated even single dose. supply issue, anti Vax issue. I'm really hoping CDC say ""Fully vaccinated people wear masks socially distance"". masked socially distanced year, got vaccines told wear masks social distance fully vaccinated told ""Yeah sorry, need due Delta variant."" Many us can't stomach again. people aren’t vaccinated way due personal choice rather young immune suppressants. I’m done bending backwards try help people refuse help themselves.  Yeah NZ we've legally required wear masks public transport solid 7-8 months time catch bus I'm one wearing one - even bus drivers can't seem follow law! actually checking state's Department Health website daily, filtered county? going ""I around people talked presence recently""? /r/lostredditors Vaccines never, ever going kill/end covid completely. That’s goal never was. Whomever told seriously misinformed. 

It’s accepted covid would become endemic like cold flu, vaccines help make hopeful reality reducing viral load, hospitalizations, death. None changes variants, virus mutating normal expected…because even viruses mutate, still maintain lot makeup original copy. true variants circulating, including Delta. may contagious whole, it’s still extremely difficult break vaccine barriers impactful way, that’s normal. 

The media likely slow week therefore hyping need to. “This in: virus behaving way viruses known man do! Alert masses!” 
I know news cycle feel insane times, 3-4 months ago exact hype happening Brazil variant. It’s different we’ll forget next variant discovered 4 months making headlines, realize also still highly effective face vaccines, that’s vaccines do. health director Ho Chi Minh Vietnam strongly suggested something similar. felt blue, know Vietnam Singapore talking tourism arrangements fully vacced countries Vietnam desperate economy destroyed. problem Vietnam vacced yet it’ll while. 

But quarantining govt camps almost everyone (F0s, F1s, even transmission chain) overloaded resources guess what? It’s spread camps like crazy. Funny works. vast majority cases HCMC camps. It’s working city cannot keep going lockdown. new mask guidance specify masks worn indoors outdoors fully vaxxed folks?

I’m fine wearing mask grocery store 20 minutes, would suck go back masking job I’m outdoors 97% time. Nothing yet check r/USTravelBan USA always required trials usa I've said before, I'll say again. Doomerism sub comes epidemic style waves. still difficult vaccines come multi-dose vials, one patient per day wants vaccine wasting doses.
Granted, US already (wasting doses multi-dose vials enough people want) You’re preaching choir here.

There’s reason ban vaccinated travelers. reason countries still looks bad rising delta cases. It'd great another shot worked well! would huge! source  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Normalcy supposed carrot end stick anyone fence vaccinations. it’s really starting feel like normalcy isn’t going happen mostly unfounded fears delta. 

And time boosters delta available, there’s going big bad scary variant media won’t stop talking about. mRNA amazing tech quickly developing vaccines variants, they’re always going one step behind virus. early days rollout desperately needed.  People can't sue anyways, unless there's willful misconduct.

It's called [PREP think totally reasonable law.   flu way less deadly come crawl people left remaining want it. think hope may lie Novovax. people ignorant think mRNA rewriting dna. J&amp;J issues, AZ. Novovax shown better results testing strong variants. also easier store transport. Make sense. probably somehow it’s diagnosed didn’t catch COVID it’s hoax one looked there. /s 😂😂😂 they're 18th country cases per million. Kinda weird fact, flu vaccine way less effective! Good idea get flu shot season. know I’m wearing mask? Could allergies. Could I’m vaccinated. Could young kids home. Could employer requires it. mask matter you? Yes, case end long covid, actually qualify studies medications. mother ran getting thinks covid testing existed. balance anymore can’t prove covid. Delta Plus, what's next, Delta Pro Max?

**Youth, Delta variant behind UK COVID people behind surge, 5-fold higher rate COVID-19 test positivity among children 5 12 years (0.35% prevalence) adults 18 24 (0.36% prevalence)** 65 older. People younger 50 2.5 times likely infected older people (prevalence, 0.20% vs 0.08%), although researchers noted infections seem growing comparable rate age-groups. 


**In 2nd school outbreak, 44 kids catch COVID — apparently Delta least 44 kids middle school northern Israel tested positive coronavirus, local authorities announced Saturday, second outbreak Israeli school week.    There's info that. identified one person delta variant since beginning month. Cases dropping since then, hopefully either propagate Sinovac still rocking bad y’all think things would get next five months Thanksgiving Christmas declared superspreader events second year row? understood 95% 100%

Except agency supposed know, known variants would cause 95% number drop. get rid masks know this?

Btw, wearing mask hard. I'll never understand people act like wearing mask torture something. get there. Seeing aussie mates FB enjoying less normal life hard! Around 15% colds coronaviruses. rhinoviruses. referring UK, know double dosed people US % population. Oops. I’ve decided go get one Pfizer shot sort “back up”. It’s easy go get vaccinated state. I’ve already made appointment.  Long covid getting say, lung damage. They're two separate things. What's concerning people almost symptoms reported lung damage, organ damage, Covid. 'long haul' cases probably suffer future. Yes, people fail understand 1 Pfizer shot highly efficacious well, confirmed phase 3 trial. title imply lots people get first shot? get 2nd jab fully vaccinated? uk seems pretty confident vaccination programme. words, mine. that's variant probably, dont think Delta much grounded Canada yet, interesting see numbers month wasn’t Delta variant, think probably would’ve opened end Summer. 

Now Delta variant blowing UK, WHO’s new guidance telling vaccinated people wear masks again, probably anytime soon. get second dose? delta variant affected vaccinated far? 

Just US starting reopening, seeing lot fear variant seems like possibility remasking again. confuses little seeing known delta variant sometime fear reopening starting. happen, it'll happen primarily among unvaccinated. projections point us hit 75% 12+ population fully vaccinated end July early August, eventual wave fall going muted primarily affect science deniers. certain point, fault get seriously ill coronavirus. This. destroying little credibility left. Worse, giving excuse unvaccinated never get it. day heard customer telling hairdresser shouldn’t happy got shot definitely shouldn’t vaccinate son time comes cause “the vaccine doesn’t protect new variant half people England die fully vaccinated.” Yes, yes really.

95% efficacy symptomatic COVID means 20 unvaccinated people would get symptomatic COVID, instead 1 vaccinated person would get it. worse J&amp;J variants. Delta worse 10:1, example. rational vaccinated person still want hanging unmasked around infected people. 

However, ANOTHER way vaccines protect you, that's woth lots vaccinated people, less likely even come contact virus. 1/20th 1/10th chance get xompared unvaccinated great. combine lower community spread, incredibly protective. multiply two small numbers together, get. really Small number. real, 'long covid' pretty rare. talking permanent/semi permanent damage, bigger issue (to atleast). I've heard(anecdotal know) people like next symptoms quite bit lung, organ damage. 

We're going know really effects people years, doubt they'll 'just okay'. earth get *that* person's comment?? UK endured ton lockdowns bad weather fully jealous. understand it, Brazilian police make American police look like boy scouts. Jesus man fucking Buzz Killington I’m somewhere lot unknown people still choose mask even though I’ve fully vaccinated (Moderna). county around 50% vaccinated also live somewhere semi-touristy me, it’s quite time let masks go. Please don’t argue trolls.

You’ll notice increasingly, perception reality subreddit getting warped. left sub point mainly unhealthy, irrational fear/obsession covid, desperately don’t want return social interaction, doomsdayers people actual mental health issues.

Meanwhile, CNN report ran whether would need boosters variants *at all*. Notice disconnect?

It’s disappointing us used come updates contribute information. Sounds almost scary Dihydrogen Monoxide! Boooooringggggg bid deal we’ve dropped measures we’re dealing half population unvaccinated. may fine that’s really far ideal situation.

The previous history Covid lockdowns, distancing, lockdowns, less contagious variants. new situation. read rules. Sometimes inform OP post violation rules. I'll remove myself. I’d agree vaccines weren’t thing feel well, lot vaccine hesitant people apathetic point due lack timeline get normal think “What’s point getting vaccine I’m low risk I’ll still public health measures anyway?”.

I think Biden doctors largely don’t recognize “not vaccinating still following rules” group bigger think.  Glad nice laugh this....I hope laugh well future science says far higher risk death unvaccinated. So....may odds ever favor. Yeah, mixed bag. old people family feel thing. felt mild cold healthy sister knocked ass day.  plan anything important next 48 hours, like trip. 

And remember immune full two weeks second shot. want booster Delta+ boooi I'll go actual statistical numbers instead anecdotal evidence, thanks. fully vaccinated, infected delta, sick enough go hospital, there's 36% chance go home..

The mRNA vaccines--which virtually everyone US got--are 
96% effective hospitalization, *reduction risk*.

The hospitalization rate ~5%, means divide 25 ~0.2%. Even assume delta increases hospitalization rate 50%, goes 0.3%. younger people, much, Concern grown country recorded 100 new daily cases successive days registering zero earlier month.
Most cases linked Delta variant ...you think going say don't.

It going spread everywhere, vaccines still 90% effective **having symptoms**, correctly understand efficacy rates *reduction risk* see drop risk death hospitalization numbers well line risks accept every day lives.

The increase cases hospitalizations driven entirely unvaccinated. downplay importance vaccines, that's COVID like many people way vaccines. vast majority young people would develop mild symptoms quickly recover. pick pitchforks, I'm vaccinated believe everyone it. feedback provided straight disappointing. hope rare one-off case. Stay safe!   Reported edited title repost. wrrr wrr, anxietyx suchx, anyx Pfizer/BioNTech jab linked 94% vaccine effectiveness hospital admission Delta variant one dose also seem know someone died car crash recorded Covid hospital.

Vinegar huffing. weird conversation. Everyone fucking tired this. punishing vaccinated Makes easier toss salad. even drop 2 weeks? knew Delta dangerous, knew coming.  Look actual facts again, random person ""believes"" immune system facts....these people idea crazy are...

Def don’t wear anywhere else unless it’s suuuper packed store something. They're obviously going delay opening July 19th. Unless cases stop going suddenly, many thousands cases July 19th, open then; may even re-impose restrictions stop spread.

By time wave peaked they're ready open, nearly fall seasonal factors bring another wave (this problem province created pushing reopening fall last year). long standard outbreaks must happen -- words, much higher standard used many worse viruses -- restrictions continue.

And yes, short-term restrictions without precedent. gone 15 months still restrictions places planning impose height much worse pandemics. 

It's paranoid believe never end, COVID never go away, always danger mutating vaccine-escape strain. way end restrictions end them; may think restrictions worth it, can't tell people, time, they'll end they're willing patient. know true. interesting! ask me.

It would wrong measure number antibodies reason something else.  skiming wiki approach seems fairly similair principle novavax. Spike proteins subunits viruslike nano particles adjuvant.

Though that's guarantee effectiveness implementation.

It sounds shady fuck small phase 1 2 studies giving public. seem line Russisia handled Sputnik V vaccine, difference they're lucky this. Infected people found long lasting B cells bone marrow. cells create new antibodies virus detected again. ""should"", maybe spreads winter, cold, seems take 2 winter cycles...for finally go every body (in 1919) vax, could avoided, but.....of course like 35% want get vaxxed maybe even 40%, meaning...its gonna take another winter surge get herd immunity likely. un-vaxxed...will either get vaxxed....or get immunity getting virus.......

so 2 winter cycles....by either vaxxed sadly gotten it. Then...you see spreading less, everyone anti-bodies (nature's way refuse get vaxxed....)  

caveat: might still spreading parts world yet 2 winter cycles/not enough vaccine's etc. variants still likely pop give boosters combat that...it battle boosters vs variants...but...after 2nd winter, getting pop. either vaxxed immunity....that make things maneagable barring crazy variant destroys vaccine something. (low chance that.)

Basically vaxxed mean could get sick pass someone else. tell me, disregarding others anything selfish? (though personally would said misguided instead selfish. answered question asked). Keep staying home Let people personal agency. tone indifference. never said want people die. care point. lead horse water can't make drink... fuck'em. Exactly.

I'm suggesting anything normal life smart aware.

No idea rule supposedly breaking. know vaccines work. Trust me. You’re making assumption much I’ve looked much trust expert opinion. 

I’m pretty sure don’t data long Covid prevented vaccines especially delta variant. Everything else you’re saying agree with. think it’s unlikely serious problem I’m gonna act like know yet. Long Covid found people mild infections vaccines aren’t airtight preventing mild cases.

There’s also major concern transmitting virus.   good Lol, agenda exactly?

That vaccines highly effective? reason UK’s current situation due supply issues, large import variant initially, reaching younger people first doses?

You’re one pushing agenda bud. search I'm sure I'll keep looking info. specific links, I'd happy take read. 10yr old cold right now. Congrats cough, sore throat, usual. covid. Still isolating same. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Your previous message carried different tone “It makes difference die” people might get it, might even spread lesser extent, likely asymptomatic

Spread ever develop symptoms incredibly rare. really seems unlikely spread vaccinated people thing. I've yet seen evidence happen (though I'm sure someday strange circumstances). Please read carefully.

They rising *proportionally*. Look means. talking people country full workaholics. take break even given. Yes are. Oh, definitely want end. fun stuck around unable travel socialise whole fifteen months.

I also think can't go around locking world every time new variant comes along. COVID already wiped tens trillions global economy. world could end financial hardship unlike anything we've seen before.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  I’m still masking washing hands, etc. go back wiping groceries Clorox wipes? Here's quick question, *any* side effects vaccine? house all. people STILL falling never ending story? think ""weren't sure"" ""low chance"" blah blah...but older virus. probably get study much anything Delta variant...and changing things....and looks likley that. (which thought would case anyway.) So...its new virus stuff changes, anytime anyone assumes...anything....is smart. 

So...whether figured yet ""officially"" seems leaning direction, although asymtomatic...but...risk virus mutates going vaxxed unvaxxed spreading like crazy both...it likey mutate...and risk even greater. Masking pretty much must therefore. see, thats unfortunate. hope people around follow similar fashion. Take care. I've 2. 00's never saw single mask anywhere pandemic. even wanted wear one, couldn't. believe cold past week...I lost sense smell taste briefly...came back fine next day. COVID back November losing taste smell worst part. So, guess point is...perhaps duration loss taste smell shorter? Hopefully so! COVID already destroying grey matter that’s people losing senses. need kill brain cells ignoring reality. Restrictions easing past 3 months, primarily people followed rules. idea end date also nonsense. 19th July date restrictions lift, anyone says ""but 21st"" needs hearing aid, since clear months 21st ""not date"", certain date. idea restrictions unprecedented also nonsense. SARS outbreak China Hong Kong back 2003, businesses closed, housing blocks locked down, sort restrictions imposed. protestors cretins want part grand narrative oppression, lives dull, like ""alternative thinkers"" ""conspiracy theorists."" talking colds flu? They're two completely different things. totally get people wanna trust narratives idea *""they"" want pandemic continue* absurd. sooner world gets better. economy depends all. saying, people think speculations much would rather believe whatever want anyway Kinda hard major American talking heads like Joe Rogan talking 3 million day saying “masks don’t work Fauci knew emails” masks work Fauci say Joe Rogan people take advice from. 

Let’s hope doesn’t mutate something worse. family member almost non existent sense taste smell, years now, determined result bad cold. Got Janssen shot nope, mix. Fully trust Johnson&amp;Johnson next. bring booster shot take it. gotten rid masks half population still unvaccinated.  go back square one kill agree, CDC f up. calling people dumb selfish, think long restrictions daily life gone on, compare much worse pandemics -- even pandemic plans countries 2020. 

Beyond restrictions unprecedented, people know pretty much real end date them. many immune people March 2020, UK probably even restrictions currently does, standard every time new variant arises raises herd immunity threshold, wait bit longer. 

I'm saying people want restrictions stop COVID wrong. clear patient waiting getting vaccinated going stop restrictions, virus always mutating somewhere world, might true vaccine escape variant earlier think.

So protesters may wrong oppose restrictions, they're right believe, point, patient following rules end restrictions; way them. Cries J&amp;J. roll dice get MRNA top? Stack buffs speak. They'll come confirm vaccinated people still spread virus. Putting vulnerable people risk. 

Great job, CDC. second dose Moderna bad first. saying luck. first shot chills, sore arm (it SORE!) 4 days, aches. terrified second would worse hearing. Week 1 well. Crossing fingers you! feel people give dirty looks. people bothered wearing mask don’t get. also don’t get children 13 stores without mask. CDC says. saying vaccines aren’t 100% effective even point worth making? doesn’t know now? part comment matters basically said “it’s fine Covid breaks vaccines that’s also happens flu vaccine”. okay barely breaks catastrophe substantially breaks through. no, it’s okay acts like flu vaccine. would really bad us. Thankfully doesn’t appear bad. got doses Moderna worst got sore arm brain fog couple days feel good got 2nd shot Pfizer context, *VERY* restrictions right now, despite exponential growth Delta variant. also high vaccination rate, suspect many protesters, though, also anti-vaxx... This. I'm tired everyone thinking reality not. Please stop lying saying compared flu covid. explaining vaccines 100% effective. seem either lacking reading comprehension simply arguing bad faith.  one outbreak… indicates trajectory cases going increase. isn’t learned last variant. UK variant contagious replaced dominant variant places higher levels antibodies vaccines.

The UK heaps antibodies vaccines assume US going fare much better?

Again, 22 30 attendees infected one person one party 5 days ago.

If original cruise ships prison observations pulling kinds numbers back then, imagine we'd thinking saying? Diamond Princess 700 3700 month point comparison.

Yes, put nation without high antibodies perilous state - third country unvaccinated, especially regions less others - see reason assume cases going start taking again. got vaccination wearing KN95 masks, often got complaints people person phone difficult understand me. ended go outside remove mask take calls work. complaints went switched cloth masks getting vaccinated. Like.. oxygen? Hang - people get smell/taste back 7 weeks. did, ZERO. bought one these, make one yourself; may may actually work, least track sense returning; doubt helps correcting estimates bc many people show symptoms.

so idea many people (unknowingly) resisted virus vaccination. Mine much less bad 2nd don’t worry! event 1 day feeling lousy better ventilator Asking real questions! helpful data know. would like know side effects vaccine. 

I coworker kidney transplant, transplant clinic advised continue quarantine low immune response vaccine among transplant patients. fully vaccinated aware immune system might prepared fight infection. fact flu larger impact kids covid, make wonder, without generational natural immunity, original flu virus could much deadlier covid 19. agreed. studies one effect (plus additional factors) makes virus dangerous? Sucks got downvoted 100% correct. Easy - take eating drinking. Greek letter names unmoored confuse people. moral story don’t travel Florida ~~and hang 10,000 people~~ good. Exactly want count assumed cases person symptoms? symptomless myocarditis exist? first Pfizer shot, felt perfect, symptoms. Today, one day receiving second shot, feel tired laying bed whole day. cannot happier I'm finally fully vaccinated. Vinegar, ammonia, cleaning chemicals, etc. worked initially, I'm BC got second dose 7 weeks first. Fully vaccinated June 13th I'm 38 years old. lmao, someone know read. Genuine question, actually vaccines enough? AFAIK miracle treatments works, social distancing beginning get hard maintain Western countries, can't imagine good things come restrictions get worse. Maybe read study Pretty sure vaccinated family got covid. Mild symptoms lasting day. cold. got flu 2 years ago flu shot likely pulling nighters finish something work. thankfully lasted days would much worse didnt get shot. hell sort “narrative” it’s truth? It’s science, common sense, points to. called politics. “ fully vaccinated, that’s safe you’re gonna get…So, what’s endgame? Restrictions NPIs forever? That’s disgusting thought - you’re vaccinated, return normal life.“

My thoughts exactly. NEVER mask cower place virus away. vaccines greatly reduce risks outside that, I’m living life. lost mine week half pre-covid bad sinus infection. pretty depressing wondering I’d able smell citrus herbs, milks gone there’s gas leak. Luckily came back, experience one reason really don’t want get covid risk permanent loss smell taste. risk permanent bad smells either like report.  already news, maybe need read widely. Vaccines 100% effective. extremely effective preventing hospitalisations deaths, unfortunately perfect. Data UK showing sadly people still die despite jabs, mainly elderly. No, that’s correct. Pfizer phase 3 trial 40,000 participants 100 confirmed cases. likelihood case reduced 95% vaccinated. Anywhere fully vaccinated BioNtech Moderna.

AstraZeneca, J&amp;J, Sinoxxx enough. Well gonna form antibodies. Whether useful... Yes, general chance mutations decreases vaccinations, vaccinated people wearing masks, stuff, chance increases one get hit resistant mutation, going spread it. 

In every infected person millions (I think, good numbers though) virus produced, every single one chance mutation. Finnish health institute’s director, Mika Salminen, told public broadcaster YLE 120 virus cases far detected passengers returning St. Petersburg, mostly soccer fans, number likely Finnish Border Guard prepared heavy return traffic St. Petersburg, key Vaalimaa border station got badly jammed Tuesday lines dozens buses carrying soccer fans hundreds cars waiting required coronavirus test border queue got longer border station closed, Finnish authorities decided let passengers country without testing, condition would take one respective home region health officials said earlier week traced infections German beer hall-style restaurant St. two main crossing points countries eastern Finland, making trip 180-220 kilometers (112-135 miles) border St. Russian city’s population 5 million nearly equals entire population latest information Russia’s national coronavirus taskforce, 8,457 new infection cases Moscow 1,247 St. Petersburg detected past one least affected European countries coronavirus 95,000 cases 969 deaths detected since start pandemic. 1,340-kilometer (832-mile) long Finnish-Russian land border closed passenger travel sides since March 2020 remains certain exceptions, traveling Euro 2020 matches. three tiny pieces protein surface. enforce pieces proper shape select antibodies properly bind? Shape critical anybody binding. sequences short useless. Personally wear one people recognize talk store lol Kids good spreading virus adults, mostly adults infecting everyone. vaccinated, need worry it. already everything right. thought false negatives mostly issue getting tested exposure, getting tested symptoms. Apparently not, seen may people claiming basically over. Possible? Sure course it’s possible. Likely? No. entire genetic sequence isn’t different either. make mine play Dr. Facebook said build tolerance way! think Coca Cola Pepsi are.... equally good? getting wrong Like… sick talking about? lol Anyone takes science gospel clever. Gospel immutable. Science changes new data introduced. Except isn’t learned last variant. UK variant contagious replaced dominant variant places higher levels antibodies vaccines. There’s reason think much different point. Australia different case. 

The original Wuhan variant *not* variant became globally dominant variant. point, variant contagious entering population almost measures immunity. That’s potential happen Australia *now* didn’t happen past. 

The reality natural immunity carries protection mRNA vaccines still ~80% effective preventing infection delta variant. There’s absolutely reason think we’ll see potential growth Australia NYC.  Yeah wtf that’s I’m saying. Portugal 77% vaccinated.

It's time discuss delta variant urgency understanding vaccines enough, distancing masking still much needed treatments ready. Mmm way heard half infections children half adults getting infected vaccinated. basically, quarter. Still insignificant. I’d like know effect - vaccinated individuals hospitalized? sort effects experienced? [Basically this, Source statistic? Always hated loved bouquet. Delta 70%~ cases largest Province. take away this: fully vaccinated less likely end hospital lose senses smell taste permanently. get symptoms, it'll likely bad cold days.

Tldr: give vaccinated see inside hospital covid. makes feel better, got second AZ shot side effects, unlike first one. hardest part got first shot. impact sensational press coverage like smell coffee morning new variants like delta + worrying. likely booster 3rd shot Pfizer Moderna moderna Pfizer it’s listed 2 weeks. honest thoughts Delta variant taking time think:

They’ll likely pocket outbreaks Delta variant states low vaccination numbers (I.e Indiana, Georgia, Missouri etc.). However, states likely won’t lockdown reinstitute restrictions circumstances.

As “serious states” like Oregon, CA, Michigan, Northeast, Fall vaccination numbers necessary avoid another surge could see indoor mask mandates returning precautionary measure, well decreased capacity limits couple industries. assume everyone see masked also vaxxed. cared enough mask begin with, im pretty sure wanted vaccine.  Isn’t people denial say disabilities? mean won’t know die? you’re right can’t say permanently say disabled? got nasty cold week ago. Fully vaxxed. Got PCR, negative, also weird ass rash time. Rash slowly resolving.  % values reported studies valid context can’t compared different datasets, although sentiment otherwise correct. Also, “standard” arbitrary. Like organisms, SARS-COV-2 either continue propagate new genetically diverse strains, reach bottle neck longer successfully reproduce additional mutation. (It could also eradicated extremely unlikely). wanted state things people misinterpret terms applied loosely. moral story don’t travel Florida hang 10,000 people good. that. that’s exactly can’t eliminate it. live ultra connected global society. keep coming back forever. happened thread? everyone suddenly panic mode? Actually often, “vaccine-hesitant” people legitimate concerns questions. characterizing generalizing, you’re ironically making situation worse. true politicized discourse. insist “other side” irredeemably stupid crazy, dig heels. also terrible 1st shot reaction Pfizer. Full body rash, lymph nodes size golf balls, felt terrible. Lasted 5 days. 2nd one still put butt, slept 20 hours night shot completely fine. Different everyone, I’m glad got second. Ok. “half” vaccinated infected number one outbreak. infected Israel. get ready variant gamma I’m tired honestly Especially there's new data, people really need take ""conspiracy"" label light new information. Vaccinated stopped wearing mask. many stupid people around me. good initial data third dose, there's reasonable chance  likely real objection something mundane: afraid needles, plain want to. people wearing masks anymore? delta variant? live?
In country pay fine leave house without one. comment removed redirected someplace else helps much /s asked doctor something anti depressant mental health? bipolar 1 anxiety (and I'm pretty sure ptsd, diagnosed) luck low dose propranolol anything else. used anxiety, ptsd, things low dose side effects taken less 100 mg afaik. Worth shot. hope find peace soon friend try third dose. trialed immunocompromised patients.

That said, scientific basis fully vaccinated people wear masks areas low community transmission father's unfortunate situation alter that. put bad boy category. science really clear people acting like mask violation human rights? 

Jesus Christ, mouth nose beautiful people can’t denied opportunity see personally? There's also Western Texas, made front page here. mask already part outfits,if done right,a mask make fit look better imo No, like ""aww, man, I'm outta cash!"" like WHO's new variant naming system there's room ""Delta"". ""Epsilon"" already taken less scary variants. MOMA today NYC, 100% mask compliance, looking it, one didn't.. though guess art attracts certain crowd due respect, people wearing n95 masks longer COVID around, COVID dangerous disease already existed compromised immune system. also want everything go back normal. Yep, gotta love it. 


Too sick work? Well, stay plan COBRA, premiums 10x. Also, income anymore. Oh, still need pay $5k reach deductible we'll cover anything. people went bars, threw big parties, follow guidelines. lead spikes, lead restrictions. people would also likely complain restrictions.  Australia: Hold beer. That’s pretty common idea vaccines, may able get spread unknowingly even you’ve vaccinated. relaxing cdc guidelines bad idea get said get people motivated get shot. Yeah I'm supportive removing everyone ability get vaccine (aka US) called herd immunity, probably look it. 
COVID never point reached, it'll spread ravage certain communities, demographics anyone immunocompromised virus can't effectively spread anymore. need check friends veterans irritates skin lot. get cystic acne bad beard dandruff wear mask daily. makes hard people hear me, hard time understanding people they’re wearing masks. yet find mask stay face without needing reposition time.

I don’t know mean say doesn’t restrict oxygen. restricts airflow. I’m really breath, mask restricts airflow enough hard catch breath without inhaling mask. It’s obviously causing harm, make hard exercise suck lot more.  vaccinated six months now. Literally No, part, stop using stick lean carrot. guidance sop China regarding Sinovac? certainly apply mRNA vaccines dont trust people without masks. Many Covid shots. wear mine places. I’m sure feel. wore mask year everything asked do. I’m fully vaxxed cdc said go ahead remove mask fully vaxxed. went ahead that. say delta variant poses new threat mask advised I’d probably put back on. main reason they’re saying delta variant poses serious risk people vaccinated threat vaccinated people. tougher pill swallow. I’m tired model entire existence trying protect morons won’t wouldn’t asked protect lthers. know people can’t get vaccinated yet probably go ahead mask kids opportunity that’s cdc recommends. don’t know, I’m kind sick protect anti vaxxers Yea CDC fucked up. public health people academic public health agree this.

It early get rid masks. anything simple fact CDC banking honor system bunch covid deniers  honorless morons.  statistical likelihood child catching delta variant symptoms? hospitalized? likelihood wear fucking mask. don’t read give us report it.   messaging actually hurts cause agree masks great, would still get shot continue using mask.

No reason to. Please know alone frustration many people feel same. glad venting finding space share thoughts unfortunately, remove comment best-suited sub type discussion.

We would like encourage post /r/SuicideWatch.

If crisis, please contact local emergency services local hotline: Hotline Directory believe made mistake, please message moderators. Please include link submission.  Yes, horrible ineffective messaging. I'm even sure scientifically accurate. Sure, high community infection rate, they're giving super vague hand wavey guidance without appropriate caveats. get point view used share it, I’m done. People seem understand - immunocompromised friend wearing n95 masks airports planes since diagnosed 10 years ago. agree Media used information irresponsibly, also gives opportunity talk Intention Treat (ITT) includes people outcome, regardless factors caused death discontinuation therapy. Every reliable study uses part measurement outcome part good, measurable science, filters biases. 

The fact CDC keeping tabs using ITT make us feel confident results getting. 

The fact media reporting way piss off. got lol, days ago. Alright we’re good. I'll go back significant portion vaccinated community sees uptick case, I'll God damned someone asks wear mask antivaxxers getting sick dying.  variant ends covid 21 vaccines effective?  Nice. Good sign area.  Well, good thing hear straighten mis-information provided WHO. Thanks much.  
But You? new source accurate 'rona information. Yeah what's happening Israel really worries me. Still unsure whether necessary, they'll probably add restrictions anyway.

*I feel like need tell caught guard...* Sure, wasn’t civil, neither people whining endlessly every thread slightest suggestion maybe CDC got things wrong May feel way. Im ready move forward life. Fuck anyone keeps trying keep is. It’s “over” me. I’ll keep vaccinations date respectful people want mask up, I’m going live normal life again, means going out, talking people, mingling, concerts, etc.  Covaxin vaccine truly protects Delta variant developed India thus tailored specifically toward Indian variant renamed Delta variant. anger directed people vaccinated. know vaccinated people able spread virus. say asymptomatic (not pre-symptomatic), asymptomatic people really huge vectors spreading virus. vaccinated person tests positive covid, never single symptom, knows positive work requirement get tested something, viral load time continue multiply quickly. unvaccinated still driving force spreading covid, increasing chance mutations. really tho.. cause air travel global economy. Unless you’re able vaccinate everyone world enough reach threshold, it’s pointless. know ones gonna stop travel trade That's literally correction I'm saying needed do. gave parent comment overall infections, relevant here. need compare current 7 day averages, did. Saying sympathy fellow human want exercise choice whatever reason, makes piece shit. mhmmm yes, ok. That's extremely reasonable hear you. may offer counter argument: Florida Man New Jersey definitely will. wear helmet car? Soon later, everybody wins! really want right, understand *wish* makes difference whatsoever.

Yes, probably go thing next winter. I’m enjoying downvoting posts  comes Delta? That’s worried. Every variant people assume it’s variant there’s going months new one. always knew CDC messed up.

Everybody public health community knew.

Folks downvoted said before, are.  post talking General Milley Matt Gaetz last night, say.

""I find fascinating that, Republicans currently (sigh) rugged individualism whatever want also ironically forcing people whatever want also supposedly supporting military, military's ideals literally exact opposite.

You know fuss Republicans making Covid vaccine? military Terminator. military honey badger. military care. Covid vaccine mando. military, get whine FDA approval. get told getting shot. stand line. get shot, then, good measure, stand even slower line, get drug test bored stares dick. military care rugged individualism.""

It part longer comment experience military. little bit long-winded. read want. would link find Reddit tends get angry link yourself. find really want clicking history. don’t see manage Olympics can’t even cope small number athletes one country. reason three day rule infectious time? athletes supposed pre-travel quarantine? guess doesn’t help infection team already. thought period pre-travel quarantine required. Same. people circle vaccinated relatives blatantly went masking rules again, called hoax, say vaccines poison. I'm absolutely exhausted trying protect nothing protect me. I'm so... tired. Counter: SoMD. soon mandates lifted, *lot* businesses dropped requirement (leaving suggestion best). May 14th. Month bit later mask wearers minority getting funny looks.

The comment right. chance right, instead half-assed, people going unless significant percentage people drop dead front eyes. unclear messaging lot ""fuck people dying, need work pay rent"" sentiment, things got effed.  link type mask taking about, plastic? tell craft cloth masks instead telling people USE MASKS. 

They also stated seriously masks work 

It beyond insane.

How many million people died alone? many die grievous error commited, virus continues morph new variants? Depends state US. Republican states overall going cases. masks really protect wearer would mean think fully vaccinated people spread delta variant? look unsure well. Google search came back with: 

“Some examples biologics include hormones, blood products, cytokines, growth factors, vaccines, gene cellular therapies, fusion proteins, insulin, interferon, monoclonal antibody (mAb) products. Patients receive biologics mainly injection skin (subcutaneously) intravenous infusion.” Got link propagandist network?

Not saying I'm unwilling believe info. I'm saying trust Maine Policy Institute.

 ties Koch brothers, Franklin center, ALEC. bought paid astroturfing organization trust all. 

I'm trouble finding similar claims sources without similar problems. also carry gun?  never told vaccinated people stop wearing masks soon. instead said rescinding mask guidance get X percent population vaccinated. beleive giving people light end tunnel would made people get vaccine. Instead cdc said everyone vaccinated need mask anymore, sudden, ""everyone"" vaccinated. mask new permanent fixture face. don’t want share air people virus no. probably won’t get it. 

If get it, won’t get serious symptoms won’t spread it. really sucks feel situation. However think main issue. hold outs PTSD depression would different story. large swath people want ""don't like told do."" Say, relaxing precautions ever *cause* cases go up? It’s funny people avoided us masked people beginning, like something wrong us. Ummm good. Lol. N95’s disaster kit got good use them. Maybe eased mask mandates begin with. 

After telling people need wear damn near impossible get ambivalent person wear one again. 

We never stopped wearing (our work still requires it) even store anywhere else. cause generally want get sick (cold/flu/allergies). imagine people already threw masks wind. never actually stopped wearing mask one cared put mask Huh. wonder DBH (in BC Canada) now. Fucking LMFAO. Tangential, cat needs blood work done. past year sick I've ever seen him. I'm wondering goes vet could get tested Covid antibodies that'd really expensive. Worked well decreasing effectiveness Man old-school d00m1ng, really brings back April 2020 sub, feels like stumbling upon ruins Pompeii looks like they've reached 50% second dosed... delta spreading would normal cause herd immunity close. adenoviruses? Odds won’t die COVID though. Kind shitty wish anyone dead tbh, fam. depends are—best call doctors office local public health let know get tested. area drive walk tests various places around city, though there’s lot less used since vaccines rolled out. Ok want money back. Lol feel like number way low. 40%+ probably  You’re making sort worthwhile point here. don’t care small group people disagree me. I’m asking explain saying it’s fine Covid vaccine breakthrough cases flu vaccine also downplaying it. can’t.

If would’ve merely said Covid vaccines never supposed 100% would agree. bringing half effectiveness flu vaccine downplaying implications here. Spreading amongst co workers answer though, doubt we'll get anywhere near working system states things looked now.

Just imagine food workers(which usually treated shit work sick, get sick days) sneezing breathing food. co-workers, actively making customers sick. seems classic COVID symptoms including [loss smell/taste less likely Headache runny nose common symptoms variant.

I hope guys feeling better soon. Life back pre-pandemic normal nearly every city US already….I haven’t worn mask social distanced months. Good thing hope you’re wrong, definitely are! basically never go place higher average concentration sick people without mask - hospital, doctor's office, pharmacy, etc. Probably grocery stores either.

It's mind boggling before. reduction people entered ICU vs after. would 5% 1% larger population.

So would ended ICU, chance fatal outcome dramatically reduced. Probably same. Moderna nearly identical Pfizer vaccine. first actually worse second, don’t scared that. Id still ready decent amount fluids Tylenol/Motrin. 

In personal experience, experiences I’ve read sub, people bad reaction first shot don’t severe reaction second. Covid got vaccine couple months later. symptoms arm pain first second shot. Covid definetly worse lol Oh shit, thought talking Australia. /s don't, however, buy ""vaccine extremely effective"" statement, fact UK 18k infection today, shows vaccines simply good enough.

The vaccines main purpose never prevent infection, decrease severity disease. depending Study, vaccines still 80-95% effective Delta variant. Yeah meant reduce ur chances reduce severity u get it. know one cluster Singapore 32% people got infected fully vaccinated. Israel recently reported new cases 50% people vaccinated. Singapore uses Biontech/Moderna, Israel Biontech. Seems like Delta variant rather high breakthrough chance. understanding vaccines efficacy reported totally wrong. 95% symptomatic covid study, hospitalization.

You might right regarding Pfizer J&amp;J Moderna / Pfzier published different strategies here. might transposing point stands. 

If correct ""95% symptomatic covid study, hospitalization"" that's still issue people think means they're immune. [Animal makes flu pretty much impossible eradicate, although work ongoing trying find effective [universal flu would make much less issue humans. I'm sure ever goes away 100% humans, lot common ""flu season"".  That’s still right. statement implies 100% unvaccinated people infected single exposure. way knowing likely someone infected exposure (it’s definitely 100%). don’t even way accurately tracking exposure occurs, let alone severity exposure. give relative reduction risk. short lives 5% death outcome? Lol...no. even 5% unvaccinated. Acetic acid example explained one person thus far. continue see something you. getting point, point making head one said seem think did. cannot see beyond me. us gotten leave square one yet (immunocompromised). Except even scary March 2020 one else taking precautions anymore. feel like days us ever maskless never social distance going forever behind us. news Delta Variant worried we're doomed forever. hope I'm wrong, hoped would back pre-pandemic normal activity, looks like be.  I’m mom, developed mask anxiety people looking funny. sees someone mask *too* literally assumes aren’t vaccinated. Um?? told yesterday shouldn’t assume don’t like people assume us. love smells! wonder taking major gamble waiting till June get vaccinated. got 2nd Pfizer vaccine *yesterday*, precisely 3 weeks 1st one. Still masking I'm noticing I'm one wearing mask stores lot time now. city 'pro mask' part &amp; waited end mandate till middle June. Last week noticed many local stores took mask signs down. Big corporate chains still seem everything up. Delta Lite 3D mean issue hospitalizations right. Even people end said would much prefer getting Covid. people ICU (2) severe comorbidaties. rate low really issue. people pointed things higher risks second dose everyday. someone got vaccinated, even fucking point Portugal **not** 77% vaccinated.

As right 50% *at least* one dose, 28% That’s way states. “rules” teeth people reason follow them. 

At least Europe it’s possible get fine another consequence - eg throwing 300 person party.

Hell, police flat refused enforce penalties signed law. 

It’s amazing correct Hollywood pandemic movies are. TFW literally everything smell chemical. Mental health is, which, can't visit family 18 months, businesses failing hundreds thousands people still work, yeah kinda important USA country full babies. New Yorker here. Same, unless really massive surge (which unlikely given vaccination rate). Sorry, lockdown protesting? idea could mix two. brief google found may side effects it. I'm showing data Florida probably can't trusted, point. answers politics, politicians fudging shit. There's point asking data corrupt. Spread variant, necessarily get sick got vaccination % number NYT, I'm happy admit mistake may be.

I don't, however, buy ""vaccine extremely effective"" statement, fact UK 18k infection today, shows vaccines simply good enough. Please name worse pandemic actually lived ? pandemic plans 2020 garbage that's mess. Ofc end date set stone virus, can't ask it, oh going go away? lock place allow vaccination work 30 year olds get 18+ year olds done. protestors cause spread go :o cases go like bunch morons are.  I've found helps look direction enter room. look needle. know hard relaxing arm makes vaccine near-painless 95% people exposed virus protected

you can't make claim unless study literally spray sars-cov2 peoples face CDC recommends continuing isolate even negative test Covid symptoms consult doctor public health getting re-tested worsening rate false negatives — test says don’t virus actually virus — varies depending long infection present: one study, false-negative rate 20% testing performed five days symptoms began, much higher (up 100%) earlier lot people flat understand magic evidence suggest that. interesting, thanks …. assume huge number rational normal people abandoned thought covid moved life second dose vaccine stimulates immune system better actually COVID-19 does. like spitting insults least try clear things up. already explained part vaccines 100% effective I’m concerned about. It’s false equivalency flu flu vaccine. Unless can, I’m going continue believe you’re getting point here. No, like that. link supports idea undercounting deaths. evidence people actually work masks, distanced, stayed home, suggested. Show evidence that. problem cold it'll last like week. That's lot sick days. Considering we're stumble blindly Delta wave chose end mask mandates reopen literally began spreading faith there's adults charge thing more. point though get back normal life. Yes people risk, like people risk die flu every year. sucks let awareness issue drop, know can’t live like last year. mental health issues many endured restrictions atrocious, businesses suffer, remote learning disaster large majority school districts, quality life low. got phizer fine, even arm soreness tbh. Get icy hot help arm pain. Good luck thanks! said two better one, eventually three almost good n95.

One lot better thought first though, really want protect use more, buy n95. give fuck People need learn adapt find new means entertainment involve face face contact people. economic aspect require extensive social safety nets (\*ESPECIALLY\* US) funding assistance businesses. It’s almost like repeating popular phrases get karma works something.  think

Not you’re anti-vaxxer, don’t Yes ""allergies"" SpO2 98 totally normal.  Fuck. Good point. I'll edit post. found this, links papers: hope right im bio genius think limit also much mutate….

Then again, fucking flu though… feel also got pretty sick AZ. I'm Canada can't even find AZ second shot mix. dont car find place second shot bus walk to. first shot pharmacy street giving 2nd doses kinda crazy.  Delta Plus?

People need get vaccinated stumble worse variant. donated blood first time weeks ago didn’t know test antibodies. Next time go, I’ll ask this. never considered wearing mask Covid, aware effective stop spread. I'm sick wear one on, know there's others like me.  course transatlantic travel *the important thing* right now... got first flu since november 2019 month ago fun always thought ""hydrogen hydroxide"" sounded scarier. would great idea. way see effective vaccines providing immunity. shit, Sherlock.

I find shocking average person ignorant need explained them. disagree somewhat idea “masks never forever thing”.  

Never “forever”, though temporary “always on” thing long COVID making rounds still people exist around.  

Instead, narrative last 1-2 months “no need wear masks vaccinated, go.. resume normal life, see game, see movie, go concert. need mask”. reality, could easily opened back recommendation keeping mask avoided great deal pain.

Instead, political theater sneaking center disease control.  Now, can’t walk local grocery store mask without everyone looking oddity. selfish

Nailed wanted vaccine keep hospital morgue.

Same. bad cold, that's fine I'll live. flu, I'll take days work miserable. please lord put ventilator. they're saying everybody mask again. That's different WHO. Probably US is, let's face it, one strongest vaccinated nations world right now. said that, yes, important countries yet reach threshold needed cull spread (that is, impacts us vaccination wise), still can, masks included . *three* masks now? remember old days one, made old t-shirt.

Personally, go anywhere without seventeen masks. also need mini blackboard chalk one hear anything say. news Moderna fares variant? I’ve loop, kept hearing Pfizer one far demonstrated work well, assuming Moderna would efficacy mRNA technology? makes feel better worried thing, everyone said second shot worse anxiety kicking heading second appointment. first shot felt mostly groggy. second shot actually feeling pretty good afternoon. next day got headache around noon popped couple Tylenol symptom free rest day. felt great still 11 days later.

(I got Pfizer) It'll years feel comfortable going something like concert county fair whole bunch people shoulder-to-shoulder me.

Nothing wrong that, long try push everyone What's big deal wearing fucking mask trying stay distant people familiar with?

There personally, regard masks. I'm still wearing mine indoor public settings. second part sentence completely interpretation. cannot avoid public space years come. literally part life. need able get airplane, go shopping, grab food, etc.

Being ""safe"" sliding scale everyone completely different risk assessment. like arguing favorite color. issues anyone else long try push version ""the truth"" everyone else. Obviously bit paradox COVID impacts us society, consensus rules required. Hence pissing matches risk assessment continue indefinitely we'll arguing Reddit long time come. didn't, gave Russia credibility deal announced. I'm young, good physical condition prior health complications. concerned dying covid still got vaccinated I'm invincible want even invincible lol This. be. matters enough people get vaccine. missed point, stop making bad faith arguments. No. risks partially greater possible risk fully vaccinated.   important thing go get vaccinated *today*, eligible. Get shot whichever vaccine want. know Pfizer effective variants. exact data J+J. decide much want avoid second dose.

But variant coming danger. ...that Anti-Vaxers prove wrong? (And awhile)

You realize, literally themselves? You’ve eliminated chance death hospitalization vaccine, they’re correct. selling Good luck trying go rest life without getting sick lol logical explanation. Although policies irresponsible, people not. People wore masks, distanced stayed home. Local governments, especially urban areas larger populations, implemented different strict orders state. feel like saying vaccinated people still wear masks would apply countries currently outbreaks. many countries Latin America, Southern Asia, Southern Africa. places control. It'll years feel comfortable going something like concert county fair whole bunch people shoulder-to-shoulder me.

This totally fine. U.S., least, many people feel differently. Minnesota, expecting State Fair 20% drop attendance year. (Normally roughly 2 million attendees 10 What's big deal wearing fucking mask trying stay distant people familiar with?

I think anybody criticize things.

However, concerts something many people rely (directly indirectly) income, big deal them. Many people also simply enjoy things. fully vaccinated, people evaluate personal risk, (in general) very, low.

Once Fall comes around, particular, nearly every American age 6 months access vaccine. vaccine might less effective. continue wear N95s. (I note people would show ""vaccinated"" statistics, presently very, vaccinated people dying covid). soviet Russia vaccine chooses you. Reddit told flu shot useless cold fever  I'll masking CDC recommends it. offering advice entire planet, right, includes countries high low rates vaccination. think advice probably solid country like &lt;1% population vaccinated... much country population vaccinated (for example). CDC thinks Delta serious enough threat issue advice specific USA, uptake rate, perfect, still really high compared to, say, Madagascar Bolivia.  I’m curious haven’t seen - fully vaccinated people lost sense smell?  Even end infected, would probably mild asymptotic case. protected part. Considering covid causes blood clots, heart attack clot blocks blood flow heart, unreasonable list covid underlying cause. DCs I've seen pneumonia respiratory failure immediate cause covid underlying cause, example. I've seen covid immediate cause death. guess fall killed him, immediate would blunt force trauma heart attack covid underlying causes. make sense majority something simple wear mask protect minority people? taught that? taught uncaring fellow human beings long many them? can't wear mask stand six feet away people grocery store? That's much ask you? still feel crap tomorrow I'll go back.
Before jab ECG blood tests chest pain think anxiety. another day after, post jab. let children near stuff! twisted way use statistics. According argument, would issue 50% elders would get vaccinated, since would still absolute numbers unvacinnated elders regions much larger population.  
In age category apart 85%, Brussels least 10% less people vaccinated compared regions. nothing vaccination centers doses administered people living people Flanders Wallonia - since actually finished vaccinating willing people age categories - readiness people Brussels get vaccinated. Acknowledging important sensibilisation actually happen, rather making excuses like 'it many people absolute numbers'. work vaccine passports? Uhhh whole point human existence? Life back normal NYC, packed concerts starting 7/1. real scam. letal one. even radar everyone. manufacturer formula. totally different thing dangerous. worse that. Media agencies reporting ""new"" cases number since last update meaning they're different. Oh Florida stuck outdated guidance hand washing year despite touch spread thing refused acknowledge aerosol transmission accounts overwhelming majority cases?

The least reliable source planet point. gave bunch generic largely useless advice around world avoid COVID, evidence came actually spreads, blew months finally acknowledged didn’t think worth telling anybody. *go stand corner badmouthing Communism Reddit* We've peaked. variant described emerge (and will), use reduced efficacy vaccines rationalize getting them. Naw, based post history, seems quite clear take vaccine anyway. point. point dont know evidence single shot JJ better even single shot mRNA vaccines. Even old strains. people would bet otherwise think JJ used single shot, data. course would love proved wrong. asking specific careful words. may assumed incorrectly knew study, apologize. important clarify ""efficacy"" multiple meanings. hospitalization deaths remains high, symptomatic infections decreased. I'm debating value put that, long clear talking about.

Regarding comment I'd quick point restrictions human behavior changed lot since vaccine trials. Would chalk difference least capacity that.

I think concept applies here. data presented study linked collected data alpha delta variant parallel, behavioral changes would across groups time. Pfizer federal government denied happened. can, takes lot work. Australia done many times. Unfortunately keeps coming back rest world can't get shit together “95 percent effective vaccine doesn’t protect everyone” saw India sure. light symptoms suddenly falling spo2. Chile. probably got hit stronger variants, that's cases deaths high late, mainly unvaccinated. People jump conclusions quickly say Sinovac work. That's comparing 2020 Covid new aggressive variants. Makes sense, variant double contagious original keeping cases high even though lot fully vaccinated people. unvaccinated half getting covid much quicker much worse. hospitals saturated unvaccinated individuals, surprise. original comment saying “it’s fine, vaccines flu thing.”

No it’s not. said that’s vaccines aren’t marketed 100% efficacy. 

Nobody’s saying vaccines aren’t valuable, they’re saying they’re perfect. haven’t cold since last February, it’s great I’ll wearing mask work large events long can. Agree! Thanks answer suggestion. clarify, happened today (I'm Europe): woke morning headache, hours later (in afternoon) went get first dose. hope helps clear things up. Cries 40 Australian problem scans hardly see anything. Clots example. dad block arteries. Nothing apart Angiogram showed anything wrong. ran every morning way healthy suppose want both: return life without restrictions elimination Covid Australia.  Dang got moderna lol  Pfizer. 1 2 doses? No, lead 7-day average. daily case numbers. Florida announces numbers week. 

I’m pleased report vaccines gone slightly well. didn’t think we’d pass 50%. yeah, there's guy /r/uk always replies negative news story ""CON +3"", depressingly accurate ever situation 10-20% people vaccinated got infected vaccine (esp mRNA)? 80-90% efficacy rate mean 10 20% vaxxed people show symptoms people living normal. rely open international borders work I've unemployed nearly year. Pandemic aside, organization makes disgustingly misogynist claims one I’m willing listen to. 

Better advice would “women intend conceive next x years refrain limit alcohol consumption,” no, chose assume women exist solely incubators, kindly get effed mask thing too. They're bad other. Sadly people country keep voting 😥 exactly people take vaccines.  Exactly article read! Niiiiiice gosh hope that’s me, brand shot get? sequencing common cold coronaviruses? possible mutations Sars-Cov-2 simply behaving coronaviruses rather novel unexpected mutations? sister strong side effects first dose almost nothing second dose. cancelled appointments planned resting, didn’t need it.  woke major headache morning, later afternoon went 

What? When? 

It's fine, worry it.

If going make feel better, donate blood weeks, tell antibodies. Stay tuned! Oh nice dude that’s reassuring really hope that’s case lol. haven’t sick several years it’s pretty weird purposely injecting knowing I’m going make sick lol Covid going endemic rest lives. never go away. got vaccinated since returned living “pre 2020 life.” always going risk catching virus you’re vaccinated, albeit small one.

The vaccinated done part that’s ask them. think they’re going keep spending lives locked house continuing sacrifice social lives, you’re touch average person. seems like many people subreddit perfectly accepting people spending rest lives masked hermit, makes sense vaccines prevent hospitalization death. Probably dumb question, woke major headache morning, later afternoon went get first Moderna dose (finally!). know recommended take pain relievers vaccination, waited got home appointment gave couple hours taking two ibuprofen headache. 

Now I'm little worried, know CDC says take OTC pain meds side effects arise vaccinated without potentially lowering vaccine's efficacy, took non-vaccine-related reasons, couple hours dose. know I'm probably fretting nothing, lowered vaccine's efficacy, I? tired sore first shot side effects second, FWIW. would say anti-vaxxers sick individuals hurting people misinformation. Flu much less deadly comparing non-vaccinated people. true vaccinated folks. second dose Moderna sore arm tiredness night after. entire family also got Pfizer everyone also sore arm second doses. Definitely given second different! silent killer. Can't believe stuff open pits planet! maybe learn “bleedy” edge means.

It 5 bit tired wrote that, funny focus J&amp;J works like traditional vaccine still uses underpowered virus: “an adenovirus vector, genetically engineered virus.”

J&amp;J vector virus vaccines work ""like traditional vaccine"". like mRNA vaccines, deliver instructions cell turn produce covid spike protein. like mRNA vaccines, use cells factories.

The difference mRNA viral vector vaccines primarily instructions delivered. mRNA vaccines cover instructions lipids, whereas viral vectors use another, harmless virus (the vector virus) basically infect cells deliver instructions.

This radically different traditional inactivated virus vaccines use actual virus injects (after ""killing"" make harmless).

Also note two approved viral vector vaccines prior covid, new ebola maybe take time learn talking instead grouping everything new “bleedy” edge downvoting.

I downvote you. argued you. tend downvote argue with. see NNN people going take spin ""We right along, want believe us!!!"" see even reason vaccinate. :-( It’s replacing current local variants. thing happened NYC UK strain case growth relatively low. somewhat alarmist assumes delta grow exponential becomes dominant strain.  wrg vaccinated, better outcomes scenarios. 

The smart thing crystal clear. isn’t well known yet? Got it, watch Loki saying then? Please explain mentioned flu vaccine. get they’re saying expectation vaccines weren’t perfect. issue bringing flu this. zero political happen.   people even give flying fuck anymore? joke Yes, time EU faced severe delivery delays. Whatever, take one every time allergies kick up.  Good idea mask flu seasons went vacation Orlando. Fully vaccinated. Came home head cold! Negative covid test. Thank continuing wear masks us normal people know avoid you! anyone seen stats who's getting sick post-vaccination? 

Is people are/were risk (elderly, diabetic, others)? I've lost sense taste smell times colds. Usually lasts day, couple times lasted lot longer. late 80s/early 90s lost nine days - Hall's cough drop mouth could taste smell all, thats bad was. 

Another time around 2006-ish got later surmised bad case viral bronchitis, maybe flu, both, know, lost senses days came back, sense taste skewed, took year go back normal. could eat bananas tasted sour. really sucked love bananas. would try every month see, one day lo behold, tasted good again. you’re wrong. That’s literally they’re saying. understanding comment incorrect matter much protest. confusing people complaining unvaccinated selfish also people refusing wear masks. Tf kind masks guys wearing throw shitfit. 

Go vaccinate. Go wear mask. Go meet friends. move welcomed Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) responsible marketing vaccine abroad

Should perhaps marketing home, looking state Russia right now. also recall Russian Sputnik shills sub gone quiet recently. I'm deleted post. commentary 'anticipation fear' reaction-based entirely inappropriate discussion, deleted.

But, Walkinman19, post sunshinecat's changed mind. 
Your 'realness' sharing experience hit hard. know meant angry shitty attitude attempt sway random inconvincible redneck like me, worked... Thanks you, two people quitting bullshit, sucking getting shot today.

For worth. 6 months telling friends family ""it's prophylactic, vaccine"" ""I want experimental gene therapy"" etcetra, etcetera... think anything it, certainly think stranger internet could say anything change opinion. rationalizing actions misguided due fear. FYI: voted Biden, I'm otherwise fairly rational person -- childish is, idea 'getting shots' kinda got mind messed up. 

I live Missouri, promise fiancee going Walgreens get today. Thanks helping, real. :)   recurring event, though.

It's 608 *in weeks*.

Even height pandemic, deaths one reporting period similar length never exceeded around 0.005% population.

Your statistic thus completely misleading. heavily abusing numbers draw false conclusions.  believe Florida’s self-reported get feeling think I'm anti-masker something, I'm definitely not. Masks really important pandemic help prevent infecting others sick, even walk around pre-symptomatic, odds infecting others drastically go down.

However, numerous studies done show wearing mask actually prevent *you* getting sick much. personal example, I'm planning wearing mask future go public cold something like decrease odds infecting others. However, wearing one prevent getting sick nobody else wearing mask helps marginally. offer little protection, much importantly, help prevent spread viruses carry. Masks never going forever thing , one suggested such. hope vaccine keep transmission low community immunity reached. Everyone understood 95% 100% it’s one tool getting us back life B.C … covid temporarily legitimised, basically.   took get immediately sick.

But think that’s made immune system exposed anything 15 months.  needed get back swing fighting things routinely.

I’m sure whether I’ll wear maybe there.  CDC helped spin narrative saying need mask fully vaccinated.  Oh, I'm aware.

But disease going endemic inevitably. happens continue massively screw up... It’s truth. second dose Pfizer sore arm day so, far side effects go. also feel like one step away new variant makes best vaccines 30-40% effective. think heading towards biggest wave yet, hopefully mutate surge. It’s like saying “It’s big deal people get car wrecks, people get airplane crashes too.” One lot problem it’s misleading compare them. It’s okay society flu cases breakthrough. We’re world shit turns delta worse variant breaks enough set us back substantially. COVID endemic. that, flu circulates annually vaccines 70% effective. simply make mask-wearing healthy / vaccinated people part society case?

It’s choice want make mask wearing part rest life, it’s unreasonable ask unvaccinated. Disease containment risk minimization, risk elimination. I’m sure anyone believes numbers Florida reporting. know they’ve lying make seem like they’re better really are. may may get back sense taste/smell. There’s ongoing research noticed mild cases tend permanent losses reasons unknown.

There’s classes learn deal that. Important since smell/taste actually important. example smelling gas let know impending danger. Taste/smell pretty key toe identifying spoiled food. I’m sure there’s stuff too.

Something seriously worth considering it’s long term thing you. know. felt comfortable enough take immediately got sick. I'm feeling pretty miserable right now, I'll reassess I'm better. nice colds last 15 months. now, probably next spring, I'll wear one. Moreover, recommended mask again, including fully vaccinated.   Laughs new zealand  Yes, point. gives accurate picture spread numbers plus, possible help know whether isolate don’t expose others. wife really effects it. may not, either. True. One year caught 10 colds. 0.00040264900662251654% 

that 608 150 million fully vaccinated adults. 

That's true think black white. wanting throw caution away entirely taking much caution seems like advocating state permanent lockdowns mask wearing. 

The comments prove otherwise. people, keeping appointments challenge things going on, kids family members take care of, job schedules keep changing, etc. Logistically difficult, easy think, ""well got one shot good protection, part"".

Imagine renewing driver's license took two trips DMV, first trip ""temporary license"" said legal drive like year, second trip month later, legal two years, difference. might struggle bother get DMV second time even though know supposed to. 1 dose Pfizer March, got COVID second week May mild extreme fatigue, puked times, puking consider equivalent worst head cold I’ve ever had. coworker also time, week vaccine got hit way harder long haul symptoms. 
Rest best dude! slept time week, gradually start exercising energy regained. think comment responding trying express concerned ""pushing"" death everyone else (kid's &amp; immunocompromised people) pushing mask usage distancing continue. biggest benefit test negative, take precautions, know experiencing something else. secondary benefit would accurate data covid cases. favourite part everyone takes Covid serious US. takes twelve close part Australia, town live still fully open despite 31 new cases, 2 3 ways town closed due fires  caused hours tiredness. Well worth additional protection! don’t know it’s permanent not. injected one billion doses. 40 percent people received least one dose, many received two doses. Thus one billion number. Vinegar fine. Bleach much. understand comparison flu shot vaccines sold emergency authorization 95/94% efficacy. 

Sounds like CDC going get vaccine return normal well never 100%... never got rid masks knew this. clearly missed joke...   1: vaccines might continue work fine, covid continue kill unvaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

single dose much. 

efficacy drops moderately resistant vaccines, particularly people received single dose. **A Public Health England study published 22 May found single dose either AstraZeneca's Pfizer's vaccine reduced person’s risk developing COVID-19 symptoms caused Delta variant 33%,** compared 50% Alpha variant. **A second dose AstraZeneca vaccine boosted protection Delta 60% (compared 66% Alpha), two doses Pfizer’s jab 88% effective (compared 93% Alpha).** continue kill unvaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

if fully vaccinated, infected delta, sick enough go hospital, there's **36% chance** go home.. 806 people infected Delta variant** ended hospital England 1 February 14 June 2021: 
527 (65%) people unvaccinated 
135 (17%) 21 days first dose vaccine 
**84 (10%) 14 days second dose** 


As 14 June, **73 deaths England people confirmed Delta variant** died within 28 days positive test, these: 
34 (47%) unvaccinated 
10 (14%) 21 days first dose vaccine 
**26 (36%) 14 days second dose**

 given know happen, need clear-eyed future.

so look UK Israel get idea what's coming.

&amp;#x200B;

**Covid cases England doubling every 11 days Delta variant takes hold** Delta variant 'moving goalposts' Canada's vaccination targets** Israel reimposes masks amid new virus grown country recorded **100 new daily cases successive days registering zero earlier month.** 
Most cases linked Delta variant abroad. 


...you think going say Missouri?

i 
**Missouri seeing concerning uptick hospitalizations due Covid-19's Delta variant, originated India. Springfield alone, 225% increase hospital admissions since June 1,** according Springfield-Greene County Health Department proceed going happen. are. safe, scientific, responsible policy. vaccines adaptable (by design) purpose. 

I meant imply opinion will. Sorry completely obvious you, splitting hairs tough work. either dishonest seeing words there. That’s fine want spend years wearing masks restricting yourself, that’s - vast majority people won’t. that’s ok! kind implied entire response poster advocating lockdowns. again, sub seems like advocating state permanent lockdowns mask wearing. said 'for me'. 

So, what. trying cute, trying annoy me, look, plain stupid? 

We're pandemic. Get vacc, wear mask, troll. 3% country vaccinated reasonable went tangent locked inside, something virtually one advocates. sinuses get stuffed inflamed typical cold, Ill day two wont really smell anything still taste. Much different sensation loss senses covid. latest tiktok challenge seas mamón pinche gringo, somos un país rico como para monopolizar las pinches vacunas wey. Deja de mamar really “off” last night (could taste salty, flavor) totally gone today. It’s kind weird though. drink something familiar texture half second brain thinks it’s tasting drink, realize there’s taste texture drink. strange sensation. still get tested make sure.  Snip snap snip snap snip snap!  offers virtually extra protection. 200 ""cold"" viruses, almost certain exposed one twice row. immune system extra ""fresh"" protection.  taste? Except main point can't say ""and will"" know *that ""settled science""*.

I explicitly conceded may variant pops significantly reduces efficacy vaccines (but probably zero), certainty. *if* happen, able boost. You’ve always 5% chance (with mRNA vaccine) get sick even standard COVID. That’s stats. you’re fully vaccinated it’s nothing lose sleep over. sympathy people give covid either die lifelong effects it? That’s “people” thing. Yeah, either. Nasal congestion gone now, food started tasting “off” last night taste smell totally gone morning. I’m fairly certain covid. Plus, got back days ago daughter’s volleyball tournament Florida (our whole family vaxxed), air travel + Florida probably ton exposure. It’s frustrating people take granted happens don’t teach evolution schools. Aka acetic acid. incorrect. safety vaccination, also spread virus around (so also vaccinations others around you). get much deadly, much virulent variant nullifies vaccines entirely gets us back March 2020 terms protection, maddening. case hope government grows balls actually mandates vaccines (once we’ve spent another year making new one) condition living country able receive them. Bro thread responding someone making assertion keeps immune system fresh

What sentence even mean? know mutates slowly.

The thing is, going stewing stewing indefinitely outbreak outbreak around world. always going somewhere vaccination rates low, outbreaks occur, mutations ramp up, etc. reason expect process stop anytime soon, always fresh mutations manage.

This basis stated opinion. planning go like rest life mask?

Just curious don’t judge wearing don’t think could wear forever. Bullshit  think critically now, that's ban worthy. one hand see point, supposed taking cautionary steps protect pandemic. idea seat belts car safety. past year half really shown upset many people get inconvenienced even saves lives. 😞

Eta: I'm exhausted selfish, entitled attitudes needlessly cost lives hundreds thousands people. heartbreak people bothered wear mask, STILL believe covid real!  Holy shit, make god damn minds shreds say? No. Two doses Pfizer:

- 79% reduced risk getting infected all

- 88% reduced risk symptomatic illness

- 96% reduced risk severe illness requiring hospitalization

**Get fucking lives** Okay. And?

Imagine relaxing murder laws people keep murdering anyway. People getting mad CDC restrictions came back childishly lashing wrong groups.  Transmission asymptomatic carriers greatly reduced. death rate 0.004%, means 603k deaths US would 15 billion total cases, meaning every single person US sick COVID total 45 times each. way accurate. 

It looks like reporting survival rate less 34 years old, total average survival rate. There’s like 0.1 percent death rate exclude old people -_- asshole admitting genuinely don’t know anymore can’t stand masks? It’s even political reasons. self esteem tanked damage masks done skin.    statement leaves everyone age 12 tho. That’s pretty huge population say they’re exposed to. 100% bend backwards keep safe get vaccinated. what's ""biologic""? family member RA I've never heard term live Canada something like October 2019. fucked respiratory illness life. lungs became congested overnight breathe properly months afterward. never went Doctor figured flu they'd nothing anyway. still wonder could've making rounds then. Ok. you. find funny wore mask 16 months, quarantined tested positive Covid, got vaxxed soon eligible, wore mask June 14th California, yet still don’t care people I’m wearing mask even told don’t need CDPH CDC. dare imply that. misunderstood?

Yes. significantly.

The hospitalization rate instance defined percentage unvaccinated people contract covid need hospitalized. percentage unvaccinated people hospitalized covid.  care. I'm vaccinated wind one 5% get sick, let die 15 months wearing mask addition isolation murder. I'd happier dead alive, wearing mask, distancing humanity. Thank     Well well.  Note didn’t mention particular group. don’t wear mask them. No.  Immmmm sorrryyyyyy, suckkkksssss forrrr themmmm butttt soooociiiietyyyyy cantttt funcccctionnnnn ifff weeeee bendddd oooooverrrr backkkkwardsssss forrrr evvvvvverrrryyyy issueeee thatttt efffffectssss 0.1 perrrrcentttt offf popppppuuuuuulaaaaationnnnn.   fully capable so

it's conditional statement San Diego proper much liberal outskirts am. family says they’ll wear masks, they’re still planning 10+ hour drive multiple States week Florida. vaccine approved provide protection. even care vaccine people get, long get vaccinations we're closer ending this.

I got Chinese one since get vaccines, approved hesitate. Got antibodies checked, yup, they're load mind. J&amp;J 60-70% mild/moderate COVID 73-83% effective hospitalization severe symptoms.

Better flu shots! third world countries able get enough vaccines yet. live, they've started first dose 50-55 age group. second dose, able get it: grandma grandpa 83 85 respectively still gotten second dose. country (Argentina) near world mean regarding % vaccinated people. erections spotty ejaculation completely question antidepressants, girlfriend also personally. explain her, understands it, still upsetting. Combine fact blames antidepressants, somewhat true.

I got antidepressants month ago, caused spotty erections become... nonexistent, within last week penis slooooowly starting behave again, hard (no pun intended) mention getting anti-depressants...

DISCLAIMER: QUIT ANTIDEPRESSANTS COLD TURKEY. TAPERED ONE MONTH TRIED QUIT COLD TURKEY LONG TIME AGO. BAD THINGS HAPPENED. TAPER ANTIDEPRESSANTS WANT GET THEM.

Is fun. I'm glad think so, called smart would huge insult lol vaccinated quite safe, statistically.

 mean ideal world everyone right thing think we've seen enough evidence show people terrible selfish. 

People it. Whether think can't matter one iota general populace. Well feel privileged then, large sea fairing vessel, need wear mast else can’t even move. grateful. IQ levels seem lower days compared 1918 go ahead die then.  I’ll take vaccine live. Bye. know mRNA j&amp;J?   Thank proving point.  I'll go back wearing cases start go again. big deal. ""duped hysteria fear mongering"" means listening experts believing science, caught us dude.   Yeah man. 

I wearing mask don’t want to. I’m fully vaccinated. CDC needs decide vaccines work not. Never stopped. knock people have. Cases county low rules eased.

But lot mask flip flopping early pandemic. stop months continuous “all clear” Sounds like great life living protecting kids, immunocompromised... I’m longer blowing Delta like it’s non issue. Horrible things happening Missouri Israel going back masks full anxiety dread. last month without masks fear nice. it’s like sit see storm approaching distance slow motion. think people taking situation granted. could back full lockdowns winter. wash hands shit much you, too? care quality life person has, neccassarilly quantity. I've moments life trade years. That's living. Yeah resource entire world? vaccine patents limiting options much world, obviously stance going 'still wear mask even vaccinated'. sure are.   fact vaccines supposed take years develop

by tens thousands researchers every single pharma outfit world?

&amp;#x200B;

out curiosity - much supercomputing bandwidth allocated last COVID-19 HPC Consortium encompasses computing capabilities powerful advanced computers world. hope empower researchers around world **accelerate understanding COVID-19 virus development treatments vaccines help address infections.** Consortium members manage range computing capabilities span small clusters largest supercomputers world. 


and last time long term side effects one 

KNOWN FUCKED vaccines?

&amp;#x200B;

**Historical Vaccine Safety Concerns**   remember, numbers effectiveness vaccination also 28 days (sometimes 21, depending study) final dose too. may spread double vaccination providing protection people think fully taken effect yet.  vaccination program really picked speed, imagine they'll done months UC Berkeley researchers, began investigating protein’s structure cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) January last year, immediately pandemic began, discovered protein nothing like ion channels known science. one thing, it’s half channel — pierces cell membrane halfway. also unusual fold seen ion channels. 
While one knows virus carries gene make ion channel — strange one, — researchers found knocking ORF3a gene SARS-CoV-2 related ORF3a gene original SARS virus, SARS-CoV-1, severity disease reduced, least animal models. This, researchers say, makes good target drugs reduce severity human coronavirus infections. high-resolution cryoEM structure published week UC Berkeley team provides key information needed find drugs.

Full open access paper Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology:  We'll see. I've heard they'll ready submit EUA late august. therapeutical products. proven, mRNA technology appear lot medicines, quite likely obsolete older vaccine technologies. frustration it. CDC say ""If fully vaccinated, wear mask socially distance"" say ""Oh wait, we're sorry, do"" going make people question decisions along ""What's point getting vaccinated still things?"". wear mask socially distance one motivators getting vaccine. smartest answer one suggests safer action. Wearing masks safer not. I'm going keep wearing fully vaccinated long yall think shits going like this? Even vaccinated people carry virus spread it. part always variants understand? Vaccinated people act incubators too. 

That last part comment - really? feel sorry you, would wish upon someone else. clearly got issues need addressed.

Life without risk life - existence.   Hilarious.

Fuck this.  People breaking law......impossible. Maybe make new law prevent happening. Nah. set. I’m thinking offer case beer chewing tobacco. don’t work maybe gift certificate tattoo parlor.  New normal  Seems like vast majority around still wearing masks. got second dose earlier week I’m going two weeks up. 

I feel like bank robber hides double chin. Also shave often. well, science says AZ good. That's correct, though remainder Israel's population mostly children seem spread virus less. point anti-vaxx sentiment reason 56-60% uptake right now. LOL afraid wearing piece fabric 99.9% people without vaccine survive unless extremely old unhealthy. Can’t help thinking there’s something wrong pfizer.
There’s never negative news it, vaccines canceled due smallest issues, basically getting competitors way

Someone making lot money pfizer controling narrative.

Ps: get pfizer too... remember lot people saying thing last summer, first time. Nope. haven’t heard happening anyone. Maybe it’s something else? Yes. don’t understand fully hesitation get shot protect further. believe sassylassie meant “the wearing masks isn’t **[protection of]** vaccinated.”  want chance getting 'why wear mask forever'? policy place, suggest start terms reasonable stop requiring masks.

Right now, US, numbers reflect bad flu season (not taking account spanish flu). never mask mandate flu outside spanish flu.

I'm beginning think like wearing masks 3k people day dying badge political right, badge political left 'masks forever'.

Both sides need come standards acceptable. think death rate 400 americans day 95% unvaccinated completely acceptable.

Subtract voluntary unvaxxed deaths death rate would make would call mild flu season.

For cannot vaccinate reasons, well made N95 mask along %60+ vaccinated public leave well protected.

I challenge come standard requiring masks post here. 55 mins Richard May gardening 5 Hammond crossing would typical episode.

But yeah. misleading data crap headlines frustrating best nerve wracking worst. Luxury locking away house indefinitely. I’m good fam pandemic catastrophe affecting entire society.  Millions died, millions lost jobs. Businesses failed vast numbers. world supply chain completely trashed.

Just vaccinated mean magically immune larger societal effects. know R naught number Israel? get real. Ya , pretty major correction there. some. I’m one judge decisions even don’t make sense. I’m saying people don’t want get whatever reason, politically like everyone seems think. oooooooh noooooooo, we're going die alllllll again. Please help us.  Seriously bro, might well wear condom everywhere goes case might impregnate women looking them. daughter supposed start elementary school August school announced won’t requiring masks anymore. sure I’m gonna now. can’t believe would make decision none students even eligible vaccine yet.  group 90% population represents 15% seriously ill population, proves vaccine extremely effective.

I understand saying here. Vaccinated people 56% population. represent 15% seriously ill patients. everyone dies eaten poptarts, everyone eats poptarts die. NYC pretty liberal many stupid reasons political affiliation impacts mask usage. visited Republican state heights pandemic you’d seen plenty people ignoring mandates. Brought experts figure whether virus airborne not. proven right? know “maskless bozos” aren’t actually vaccinated? reason getting downvoted extremely unlikely (last checked something like 0.0001% chance fully vaccinated people dying COVID), entire point vaccines. 

Vaccination always goal, implying vaccinated people wearing masks forever means really end life back normal.  Yeah, fucked hard. Symptomatic infection. May higher risk carrier, though. Delta variant? BrO 240 CaSeS, PaNiCkInG?

&amp;#x200B;

THINK CHILDREN. can’t serious...  Already it.  Yeah really. shit like forest fire that's raging year. Even thought completely out, point, could still embers place. People keep treating like something starts one day ends another. literally living thing. maybe since guess viruses alive. point made!  Right on, good analogy there. Thanks mostly civil. still choose wear mask article appreciate input. slimmest chance possibly killing someones family member covid didnt know since asymptomatic enough me. masks arent discomfort slightest either, thats bonus  say BS. choose get vaccinated,because deluded, deserve get sick. done coddling misinformed morons. Shhhh, loud. want hurt two brain cells guy has. Lmao read somewhere helped understand bit clearly works :) CDC two different things. CDC said former, said latter. vaccine makers clever, could make vaccine effective first version virus, less effective second, third variants forth, people get biannual vaccine ""subscription"" full immunity variants. article says we’ll enough doses fully immunize 75% mid next week, it’ll move fast now. first lesson fear mongering 101: Click bait makes money. Actually matter. 

If motive trying protect protect others, end protecting citizens country it. selfish perspective matter. 95% people wearing masks US daily spiking hundreds thousands cases. anti vax propaganda. Vaccines medicine tools fight covid. 

Now I’m saying masks don’t work, wearing one 5 minutes you’re grabbing something target isn’t gonna matter go home 10 people maskless, happens. transmission happens inside home. 

If anything, recommend masks inside home sound... *A G L E*. No, others answered, others given sources, you’ve chosen cherry-pick answers want them. That’s confirmation bias, plain simple. Good day. Oh look, cases unvaccinated people, still makes \~40% population. never herd immunity begin act surprised infected people unvaccinated contagious strain. news, sky blue. Wait minute…so people won’t wear masks fully vaccinated like anti masks? guess fully vaccinated part doesn’t matter now? exactly psychopathic insane this? wasn’t fact viruses mutate hosts, it’s getting close point haven’t vaccinated…..
Also immuno compromised people.
But jeez, part really wants let refusers get it…  yet yet vaccinated city America surpass vaccinated city Israel also surrounded vaccinated country world recommending masking indoors. sorry pandemic ain't over.  Damn, even better  Yes, Israel's new mask mandate benefit unvaccinated. Ugh exact question. feel dumb taking first appointment we're swimming extra Pfizer vaccines...  children infants get vaccinated start. I’m anything would required flu point. high risk population protected. hospitals risk collapse. get leave us alone.  point people need able return normal lives, it’s logical people ask might over. I’m asking it’ll over. I’ve followed rules, I’ve distanced, got vaccinated. government mandates state got back forth like 30 times. People going stop following instructions stop wearing masks institute told thousands times get vaccinated take masks doubles back says doesn’t matter need wear again. answer lies somewhere middle fully shutting everything fully reopening everything. sports administrators said 11 countries, including India, Pakistan UK, would affected.

&amp;#x200B;

have countries complained.. reasonable given situation? neither, wearing N95 work March 2020, respiratory virus spreads air. one else clue, thought nuts! r value several diseases comparison.  seem way invested am. Enjoy reading boring comment every thread that’s thing, don’t expect make difference. Yeah turns still take reasonable precautions deaths, there's also serious long term complications many survive brain damage.

For would 7 day average less 5,000 cases significant amount random testing confirm there's little spread. Largely Ivermectin’s use coronavirus isn’t well documented. good news clinical trials underway coronavirus specific. won’t least bit surprised receive chemical makeup mimic directly borrow significant pieces ivermectin. trust people anyways lol, masks stay on.  elaborate? I'm sure assuming think one type interferon. also nitpick people broadly mention ""antibodies"" instead specifying IgA vs. IgG vs. IgM?

The paper shows B.1.1.7 infection led lower levels IFNβ expression secretion. denying that?

They also reference research viruses IFN resistance correlates enhanced transmission. denying research too?

&amp;#x200B;

As vaccines, said, effectiveness still good two doses, much single dose, acknowledged. meaningful difference countries limited supply vaccines chosen strategy giving many people possible single dose first. Idk who? sure either! laughed due pun said ""Vaccines best shot"". dunno. There's lots information available reputable sources they're choosing believe lies convenient them. Like hundreds thousands dead people convincing enough. point hold responsible bothering inform biggest thing happen world long time?  Yeeeaaah like, we're talking insurrectionists compared anti maskers lol.  would wearing mask prevent touching doors objects? surprised knew much people use coke lmao US enforcement mandates basically crapshoot vaccines CDC announcing vaccinated people need 

Trying backpeddle get people back masks grand re-opening we've last weeks since CDC dialed back would like trying put Spongebob bandaid bloody stump arm used  know two friends vaccinated Pfizer super sick right COVID.

Doesn't really bother wear mask, know others I'm going keep using mine. FFS number wrong lazy, get  mean science said super unlikely die anyway you’re overweight underlying conditions yea ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ I've got couple kids home. I'll wearing mask get jabs. 
 
There's long term Covid impact kids study, I'd rather gamble future health. 
 
Sure, low risk today, five years co-morbidity pops up, I'll glad kept bubble. Even matter... it'd like trying put toothpaste back tube. People whole going go back wearing masks. uphill battle even before. look getting second pfizer/moderna shot, i've heard that's thing Oh brother guy stinks ""Just stay indoors two weeks"" it? ivermectin, rarely talked Well alot flexibility meaning need want see could work know everyone reacts differently Idaho also right next door, really vaccinated compared Oregon. aggression stand, man. advisory vaccinated people getting infected. say anything vaccinated people becoming severely ill dying understand concern here, prevent spread unvaccinated people, inevitably going catch virus regardless masks measures long choose get vaccinated? Nah. I’m going continue living life  Yes, going use sort tech enforce mask wearing. simply happen. US least. studies underway— NIH (moderna) started trial boosters given 12-20 weeks past second dose. started beginning June, hopefully data positive.

The NIH also looking giving third moderna dose (as booster) participants vaccinated Pfizer J&amp;J.

You won’t stuck J J indefinitely. Eventually you’ll able get another vaccine, prefer. Thank much that. 
Do link data? know works, saying good idea keep wearing mask, even vaccinated, easiest thing world do. People impression vaccines magic 100% effective. need herd immunity counter people can't get vaccinated (including kids right now) people vaccine less effective. 

We're safe measles we're vaccinated, we're safe everyone around us vaccinated. get pockets unvaccinated people get outbreaks. covid. lots pockets unvaccinated people harbor spread disease makes everyone less safe. America: ""Too late, CDC already said covid over.""   still effective vaccine assume recommendation based still potentially contracting spreading unvaccinated.  got vaccinated delta variant. 

But really trust going prevent catching still wear masks I'm store places indoors. goddamned plane crashed mountain!   expect either. wear mask others sleep night knowing might putting someone risk. also covid recovered wish anybody. covid? fully vaccinated grandfather got COVID like 3 months getting second dose. symptoms equivalent minor cold 24 hours fine. He's like 86 years old. Instead dying minorly inconvenienced. goal vaccine. different variants virus different strains flu. vaccine works Variant 1 2 well, mean works well Variant 3. Yes? practice medicine dual doctorates medicine psychology. lend credibility. also quite literally said, “see: every coronavirus ever” nature. isn’t wild conspiracy theory, basic microbiology. I’d happy point peer-reviewed and/or meta analytical studies “coronavirus” encourage applaud questioning statements heard. However, “never” come across this, may better served starting Biology working way viral behaviors. “Law declining virulence” well researched understood (Smith’s notable) provide source 12 full vaccinated people dying England? I'm saying wrong, [official say 16 people died Monday whole UK COVID, let know I'm missing something.

For worth, *do* wear mask despite fully vaccinated, incredibly diligent social distancing mask wearing past 18 months. 

My point messaging saying vaccinated people still social distance wear mask harmful statistical odds fully vaccinated person dying COVID. people hesitant get vaccinated seeing fully vaccinated people exact thing, what's incentive? 

The entire point vaccine get back normal. fully vaccinated line go back normal, is? going able take masks off, fully vaccinated? No. Restrictions daily life 4 years typical pandemic history. Stop gaslighting. I’m adding information think important missing article - mentioned [the original Japanese article reporting 2925 people entered Japan Olympics-related reasons, 2213 applied exemption mentioned article posted OP participated pre-games preparation immediately.

The French, Egyptian Ghanaian nationals tested positive airport quarantine counter, Sri Lankan national tested positive 5th day since entering Japan. 

Given fact majority athletes ties games exempt quarantine, suspect Sri Lankan national interacting people Japan testing positive. fact Japanese government failed disclose positive cases inquired newspaper company undermines trustworthiness. I'm you, got date time frame. problem is, can't nail end people part, Rapture confirmed. Education. People think 100% protected they’re vaccinated. case. major life event, like Olympics, least wearing masks even self quarantining testing leading event. privileged position refuse vaccine shots.
 Somebody tell athletes probably higher chance getting killed road accident way airport rather vaccine someone wants source: Lol right?! There's reason flu cases go kids home winter vacation. (That cooped indoors course) blurb mean much. deeper understanding suggest checking r/COVID19. good discussion people understands subject far I.  fucking lies mask efficacy EVERY SINGLE news organization completely destroyed trust news outlets. aren’t 95%, 79% effective? I'm done. I'm wearing mast anymore. Sorry, give fuck I'm sure exactly distinction, thought post saying vaccines efficient \*hospitalization\* due Delta variant. still get infected Delta show serious symptoms, perhaps even pass others, still makes sense everyone wear masks protect vulnerable (right now, children 12 cannot vaccinated). date studies Delta infection rates among vaccinated, either way, change personal behavior (which wear mask indoors stores, outdoors cannot maintain significant distance, eating restaurants inside out) common cold permanently damage lungs major organs Wow, that’s lowest number remember since you’ve posting these, Friday too. think we’ve pretty much plateaued point. hiring? always win every war. 

What's exit strategy climate change? floods fires new normal. 

Sometimes adapt new conditions. case could accept masks forever, maybe accept extra thousand deaths new disease every year. Nobody yet knows.  mutated much going ""weak"" flu.  still wear mask (even CDC said required vaccinated) bother me. CDC changes course, whole lot people upset, comply That’s take too. vaccinated wear masks help bunch idiots won’t wear mask! Nah, essentially same, talking ""just stay inside two weeks"" instead. ""just thing"" y'know, end good.  fucking stupid. hear EXACT opposite information sub every two days.  Yes. unvaccinated get disease. they’ll either die live. Bro, talk mainly like milestone Biden administration, like earn achievement. advice general public secondary. Many people already make mind now. illusion U.S. though. definitely tail end. someone edits occasionally chipped debates thing seems little daft. mean given virus popped next labs studying viruses think could say one hand might a) natural origins could b) come lab leak evidence ... oh no! b verboten! seem 'neutral viewpoint' supposed have. got unlucky—I'm following next month confirm, reason went ER pulmonary effusion (which appears caused undetected myocarditis). Yep, there's evidence virus started spreading much earlier first thought. Duckduckgo YouTube good medical academic sources. I'm saying time hang masks dance streets shouting covid over, original commenter simply voicing frustrations endless feels. response equally frustrating since know full well blame still offer solution  Soo, basically youre saying everyone going get vaccinated get dont matter. Doesnt matter long term effects not. asking guarantees 100%s real world. work way. 

What say wearing masks getting vaccinated going keep around longer. 

""Getting back normal"" moving target people ignore guidelines farther moves away. new variant could mutate current vaccines effective against, back March 2019.  exactly comment receive upvotes depressed people agreeing me. dude disagreeing, may make witty remarks appreciate him. 

Do something dude, whatever takes get this. bit hypocritical part talk positively. volleyball something. you! UK taken first doses soon second doses... hit hard obvious data pandemic never ""over"" yet, still lot know. one gotten fully vaccinated either ever bothering wear masks fought like grown babies. CDC could worded shit way better. That’s succinct, hard truth all. Vaccines developed available. Anyone didn’t want remains risk, relative can’t helped *probably* used take extra care. far I’m seeing around live, whole mask distancing thing done. know, who? Ban food poisoning? Nah, it’s choice take risk it’s transmissible. Discourage consumption it’s unnecessary animal cruelty abuse? Absolutely. aren’t good vectors covid

Doesn't mean they're covid-proof. Kids nasty, regardless. Ya, myocarditis rates general population hard pin due exact thing, mild cases going undiagnosed. condition generally mild improve rapidly. it’s masks, it’s lockdown. I’ve pandemic year half now, know works

Pretty sure exactly opposite last year. Wait said what?  43 percent feared getting vaccinated could jeopardize immigration status least ability.

Small group people know vaccinated, might okay mask? Going like shopping movies? Mask up. doesn‘t really contradict point.

Might years truly understand it, ever.

Get vaccinated, save could mysterious never understood disability.  wish would sniff people worked 12-15 hours day home 5 6 days week pandemic. they're sniff people vaccinated risking health lives (due increased violence streets subways) trek offices. promotion worth damn I'm infected, injured killed covid-19 mentally unhealthy person. trust say company another (live) body lined warm swivel chair week out.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Neat, TIL. That's definitely true, I've wearing contacts much they've worn eyes raw   Yea free beer donuts worked well huh. Masks done America. matter cdc says, nobody going back masking. That's cold hard fact. I’ve gotten doses well. still wearing mask. read fully vaccinated doctors nurses still getting infected decided I’m risking getting COVID. Meanwhile Germany, we're like 1-2 months behind US vaccinating. Everyone's finally getting first dose, lucky ones two. 

And rest Europe probably slower are...

Let's see Delta variant goes here... definitely need speed here. category also includes children 12 well, yahoos don’t care don’t want vaccine. no. Dad died way, pneumonia. I’m convinced good amount redditors enjoyed initial lockdown. new exciting lives not. genuinely would mad went back hard lockdowns. I’ve recovered covid two doses Pfizer, like totally impervious covid, variants all? Russia produces vaccine, population refusing get vaccinated. saying still manage run vaccine?

Sounds like r/ANormalDayInRussia .... mom admitted hospital oxygen levels really low fever. fully vaccinated admit I’m little nervous. Still don’t know what’s going yet happened. Interestingly, actually much likely get heart issues covid infection vaccine itself. Forbes great article earlier week, that's American Heart Association still pushing vaccinations, since ultimately reduce risk myocarditis heart issues caused covid. NY probably better benchmark UK. NY high vaccination rate high number fully vaccinated opposed one shot. high population. We’ve serious goal shifting past year half respect vaccine expectations. remember original comments “we going vaccine 18 months best hope 60-70% effectiveness range normal flu shot”. vaccine within 9 months, 90-95%+ effective. there’s new variant might slightly decrease that, it’s still far original hope, it’s causing second wave panic Yeah, sucks many people stupid ruin smart people. *Most* important mean *the important thing*, lot people treat way - outcome either death normalcy. fact, many people die COVID end suffering debilitating long-term effects plenty people taking possibility seriously. theoretically effective variants

Will interesting see results phase 3. whole virus vaccines induce broader immune response (therefore higher efficiency) IIRC concerns way virus ""killed"" inactivated vaccines - surface might damaged along characteristic spikes seem best target immune system. Sinopharm's inactivated vaccines showed lower efficacy viral-vector mRNA vaccines, maybe due fact (although might reasons it). wife oldest felt little tired nothing stopped work school. youngest fever felt day. Worth ask me. Saying masks still needed even you’re vaccinated would disincentivize people getting vaccinated. many people already considered COVID would light cold would survive, point then? Yeah it’s concentrated form, strongest acid, it’ll mess up. obviously going hard time hurting self bad dilution vinegar. Expecting post downvoted pretty substantial peer reviewed holds up. 

I mean guess adds already existing mountain evidence. hope right, say. think pressure delay still exist cases higher now, especially deaths hospitalizations also rising (they rise fast used to, course, still rise).

But can't blame people want go protest reopening, needs equivalent pressure pro-reopening side. sure would 2k situation. laboratory cost covid19 antibodies like $20 maybe one test. vax? long covid symptoms think covid case well year ago. got vaxxed December.  get it. Russia first country vaccine, exporting vaccine countries citizens mostly remain unvaccinated. normal last summer too! GOOD USERNAME, ROLAND SON STEVEN  wonder mean Massachusetts; Massachusetts said masks required schools come Fall; I'm bit nervous that. absolutely true, protects others droplets.

Does nothing aerosols pass right through. could go harder, still reasonably move city fun times. Yeah...(teacher here)...my school went mask free still wearing mask (one few)...and sure enough, 10 days I'm one sick. Covid negative. 101+ temp. Bah humbug. Largest* Oh Freedom march London today gona go well.... Tuesday, Russia Portugal Germany's ""Variant"" list, UK already while. Makes travel much harder. source stating respiratory viruses actually areosolized? far know droplets. statement respiratory virus ( I'm aware covid areosolised clear) Yeah.  That's vaccines work. They're miracles. hate Joe Rogan. stupid piece crap irresponsibly spreading bullshit also literally asymptomatic. Asymptomatic, fully vaccinated positives even counted case. still solid evidence Oxford AZ vaccine ""SIGNIFICANTLY"" inferior mRNA vaccines. fact real world studies shown vaccines close other. 

Also vaccine vastly cheaper supposedly produces better cell response even Pfizer vaccine.

So everyone regard second class vaccine? might silly recommendation perhaps rewarding something (like bucket list type experience sort item wishlist) would good source motivation. way, even overwhelmed anxious, able focus whatever awesome thing reward getting vaccinated. terrible fear flying, instance, tell I'll treat something get with, I'm able focus reward tune unpleasantness plane journey moment. I've also found bringing friend along good way distract yourself. Perhaps close friend go distract experience. moral support really go long way. Anyway, best luck. got first shot felt nothing following days. got 2nd shot Wednesday side effects made feel like absolute shit. entire body ached horribly, colder remember recent memory way warm up, even covers. Horrible headache. day long night day body, head lungs hurt.

The 2nd shot fuckin sucked me. thought would like first one problem.  Logistically seems extremely difficult. Rolling vaccine incredible accomplishment. Collecting blood samples, keeping track all, running tests, returning data, expecting people follow vaccines based results seems optimistic. “hurr durr Americans lazy” way. There’s lot moving parts program 100 million vaccinated people considered insinuated either.

It's reason people protesting though.

Not anti-vax.

Let specific saying large number anti vaxers present protests.

I specifically saying look reason protests anti-vax deflect real problems that's handling information made public pandemic ask public trust you.

Please leave hyperbole aside try hardest place camp one government made balls protests bound happen case. I'm sick news stories scare mongering delta variant. vaccines still incredibly effective. Get vaccinated. sure, maybe 10%, guess what, probably going fine end hospital.  Masks stop slowed it. I'm ready return normality countries everyone get chance vax. care people feel safer wearing masks mandates, please, time go back normality mental health collectively deteriorates further. seem like point. appears peer reviewed data, context, analysis basic reasoning gone window. Nearly half comments see insidiously implying vaccines aren’t effective, we’re back square one, plainly ignore data, etc. really don’t know point whether it’s delusional people actually agenda. aka. Johnson &amp; Johnson single shot vaccine got whiff concentrated acetic acid chem lab one time. fucked nose really bad, probably explains shitty sense smell. test like work like chicken pox cost like 2k test guess vaccination kid take Would love know “escalating” determined bot whatever say lol. 

I trying say argument comes ego well I’ll leave that. can’t possibly consider lockdown. Edit: said don’t agree guess don’t protestors do. heard great filter. You’re one applicable situation all. Maybe Google great filter sound little educated next time; you’re trying hard. I'll honest, plan getting 2nd dose information comes out. I'm anti vax, believe vaccines, trouble trusting one.  even know peer reviewed studies are? guardian article *not* that.

You disregarded every bit evidence listed, easy verify, discredits *every single thing* said. living alternate reality. failed provide one single piece valid data supports opinions, disregard ignore overwhelming amount evidence **does agree you**.

And *no*, claimed **impossible** develop vaccine, hilarious multiple levels. I'm able give blood since lived UK longer months little :( interesting see number people saying terrible things get mask wearing preventative measures going down. realize lot areas, like state, mask wearing social distancing never really widespread thing. Almost one wearing masks now, even January like quarter people public spaces wearing them. Places full capacity pandemic. Daily cases right like third one percent peak. that's also one lowest vaccination rates country. 

Will things get worse fall/winter? Probably. get anywhere close back January? No. don’t agree. take feelings coalesce personal demons. It’s process, we’ve gotten pretty good it. Yeah, here. live state 75% eligible population got least one shot. county 125k people seven day average 1 case. I'm going back normal life going back eating restaurants. I've enough seclusion I'm tired eating home! rules place July 9, people may leave home essential work, medical care, education shopping. rest state limits public gatherings masks obligatory indoors. Anyone position actually research variant needs know first identified, entire history observations, perfectly capable looking generic name. Literally one else anything useful based name place first identified, need put name variant.  Possibly. NE states Northern Midwest states well still seeing cases drop. also part done well vaccinating.

Also, California actually high concentration delta cases right now, case rates remaining flat worst marginal increase. Showing vaccines effective Delta. know this. 95/94% implies 100%, meaning people still get sick. Since risk hospitalization/death significantly reduced, masking guidelines calculated risk assement. misinformation selfishness denial. Vaccines certainly answer-look history. country lack trust human empathy mean vaccines longer valid. trigger probably escalating rather punching equal force. I’m genuinely anxious next months. congestive dissonance come cases skyrocketing vaccinated people getting sick told “we made it” break people. seem two minutes ago EU regime blocking vaccines Australia. Israel reported half new infections delta variant fully vaccinated people. Major organ damage also Even person continues wear mask important aware mask mandates lifted still expect significantly higher chances exposure area maskless. likely many public businesses also relaxed heightened cleaning procedures. 

If typically wear cloth mask might consider going back disposable medical masks, un/partially-vaccinated weakened immune system (or otherwise super cautious) may want go full n95.

And remember wash wash wash hands! requiring eligible patients get vaccinated well? vaccination = health care. Freedumbs work ways. dismiss anything media propaganda watching trucks filled bodies fucking disgusting. ones tried?

My friend works covid scientist, huge violation rn testing equipment. 

Unless ofcourse mean free quick-test sites labs(which may case). recommend either turning paid lab tests buying quicktest reagent yourself, providing facility.

Regarding spread, spike 30 50% December values. Well, weird. like desperation scare away people flirting with. Trying hard sounds alarms. think would met less resistance went ""Hey, there's vaccine now, want it."" still fix problem. contagious days prior symptoms common cold 2 weeks symptoms begin lol already infected people knew it, cant stay home work get paid long enough keep giving it. Thats masks important. im sick, usually always wear mask carpool close office areas, sneeze cough sleeve, constantly wash hands best spread it. test LEX KY anymore. think giving (covid) sick people transfusions people covid antibodies. 

I wonder stopped treatment longer test local blood center? AZ isn’t good choice younger people, especially context low infection rates. It’s sucks wait better options them. see somebody saying ""let vaccine refusers die"" read saying care safety ones can't get vaccinated either. Like not, ones can't get vaccinated situation ones refusing it.

Saying need let run vaccine deniers includes kids, whether like not. virus differentiate antivaxxer kid, pregnant woman, immunocompromised individual. anyone says ""I'm done, let get sick"" including unvaccinated people, whether intention not.   Similar, non hotspot, got AZ April 23, Moderna days ago today. 1 month ago Canada 4.5%. sub overtaken anti-vax bots something? Yeah live city mediocre vaccination rate.  pretty sure don’t data long Covid prevented vaccines especially delta variant.

Vaccines prevent COVID. Therefore, default, vaccines prevent long COVID. Also less contagious. Whew thank you. panic. Absolutely.

So naturally, watch everybody repeats mistake again. Moderna   ""Normal people"" almost always, every point history, primary obstacle progress. rises, yes perhaps. different case rise younger part population yet vaccines. disagree comment, don’t think hospitalisations deaths lag increases seeing. en example, back 8-10 K cases earlier year death rate hundreds. Today 10k level 20. `reduced risk getting infected all`? we’ve seen time time again, time act case numbers still low growth rates high. happening right many areas.

People tired, virus simply care. probably %76 hospitalizations deaths covid occured people age 65... one people wears masks outdoors.... Like... Why?? also wear alone car? fun! supply breakfast lunch,pick patients homes take home. nurse make appointments various doctors take there. check blood sugar give insulin, monitor blood pressure give daily meds. could go explaining patients much love them. I’m so, tired this… &lt;sweat splashes front Could please use breaks create paragraphs. 

No offense it’s really tough read kind style damn ADHD. answer continues vaccine passports. Forcing people responsible thing got vaccinated back extraordinary measures protect community transmission irresponsible back-assward. Stop letting unvaccinated assholes non-essential, indoor, public spaces us right thing live lives. That's dog. 

Get vaccinated pay price. wore mask followed rules way got vaccinated continued wear mask months. enough, especially expense pay people choose remain unvaccinated. immune compromised need wear mask understand, cannot ask entire population continue suffer hands couple ignorant people choose ignore science. do. still spread disease unvaccinated kill them. Plus variants, it’s matter time vaccines fail. need booster? get disease? don’t want covid. put seatbelt concerning seatbelts around you. Yes well Im buying anymore. Yes, problem allowed ask customer vaccinated, know wear mask. Yay forever lockdowns! keeps going, soon ""fully vaccinated people minor symptoms end hospital caught X-variance"" Developing updated vaccine isn’t hard part: distributing fast enough variant takes hold is.

We’re race get whole world double vaccinated crush remaining viral transmission vaccine escape happens. would absolutely devastating fail last minute reset entire vaccination effort starting point people impatient reopen prematurely. many people county?  ""Most unvaccinated"" close 80% world's population. COVID kills 20.5% unvaccinated solid organ transplant patients test positive. Fwiw. many get immunity vaccinations. member demographic find “they always worry” line pretty key. don’t generally live bubble, career, office can’t go to, nice walkable neighborhood can’t go inside usual places. I’m living fear, I’m pragmatic, comparable airborne illness lifetime. Hopefully third shot got kicked antibodies. Two cents. Testing? users for!? Test production!! but... realize people felt like wearing masks important thing them, right?

Yes. I'm absolutely aware idiots. people feel way. can't discount they're misguided.

Yes can. check response u/DontFearTruth above, put really well. sucks (and also WHO, CDC), sort inevitable antivax anti-mask crowd digging heels. Yeah actually lol. gone 30 devs 70 now. such, nickel dime us everything. Even though give 5 figures work year  Guess wait car come complete stop telling people put seatbelts on.  I'm really point, least area, 80% eligibile people vaccinated make sense. want vaccine already gotten believe think so. believe sick dec 2019/Jan 2020 Mine mild cold. Unvaxed coworker feels like dying. Past 8 days. 

She 28 gym active. cancel race going weekend.

Team vax way. hear ya there. Torture device! Actually covid vaccine both. virus continue mutating even vaccines since people still catch spread it.

The vaccines goal prevent serious symptoms, stop catching it. vaccines job 100% efficiently.

A vaccine stops even catching bonus.

There ALWAYS variants. Always. kind thinking, immunocompromised people, get N95 masks actually protect breathing rather vaccinated folks wear masks again. I'm vaccinated wear mask absolutely necessary again, buy damn, like said, end goal. I’m well aware I’m downvoted: told might completely finished pandemic yet unpopular. Unfortunately, it’s reality.

Vaccines great. won’t wearing masks forever. actually *solve problem* whole community everyone safe. give prematurely shrug, we’ll fighting never ending stream vaccine-evading variants right.

We aren’t woods yet, huge number downvotes won’t change that. somebody makes bullshit mean ""neutral"" position treat true.

I could come bizarre conspiracy theories regarding every major event logic deserve wikipedia. stats 88% symptomatic infection, 79% figure efficacy *all* infection. means symptomatic asymptomatic. Mine middle color one. still got 70% somehow. Yes. Okay but... realize people felt like wearing masks important thing them, right?

Like people feel way. can't discount they're misguided.  don’t manual labour spend days homes without air conditioning. It’s hot. fogs glasses. 

But it’s less pleasant wear bra every day. 

In fact, I’d take masks bras rest life. similar SARS1 wear mask must thirty them, interesting fun, least 3 women's faces..with two faces me.with lipstick. great conversation starter, everyone likes ( I'm wearing friendly smile ) bonus 1. lipstick needed 2. sunscreen needed face. Boy I'm lazy. I'm retired main job events I'm going continue wear them. I've got little silicone dealies help hold away breathe. get vaccinated Kids covid proof be. hasn’t single documented case healthy child dying covid, according Dr. Marty Makary who’s team used nations insurance database cross reference. even overall, [there kids entire US died covid. kids asymptomatic, don’t get infected don’t spread it. kid school person entire year full time less 100 covid cases children entire district 6,000 kids includes high school. Zero traced school spread. yeah, think it’s safe say kids covid proof come.

Had edit comment, link Dr. Marty Makary’s article flagged totally shit automod.. swear people seem think virus bad causes people cautious/ask people cautious. virus isn’t causing disease. Whether anyone angry even notice, ship sailed. completely new deadlier virus could spring next week think majority people done masks, period. apparently much ask millions people first place, pandemic ""over"" never get significant number wear masks again. 

It exactly bode well next dangerous respiratory disease springs up, guess we'll crash head wall come eh. end though? people always existed obligation take care themselves. point society accept risk, can't continue zero risk society.

Does whole society hamstrung needs 0. 01% population? Well, humanity overcome worse pandemics horrific situations general get back normal. gotta positive. community spread reduced.

The point vaccines reduce incidence virus community.

Once viral spread lower, risk lower “herd immunity” achieved - even immunocompromised people vaccine less effective protected.

THEN, it’s safe return normal.

People skipping step process. No, mostly elderly patients demencia, diabetes needs monitoring, elderly cardiac conditions including high blood pressure go 5hrs day children go work knowing parents,etc. cared for. fiancé RA. dipshit brother in-laws anti-vax, anti-mask, anti-anyone-who-is-an-expert-in-virology-and-microbiology, pretty trying time lives. prospect someone else's suffering and/or death much people bear burden mask. Surely risk get virus rather get vaccinated? think avoid exposure virus big event. ship sailed. 

After initial ""two weeks flatten curve"" turned year, hard imagine people wore masks requested, stopped wearing getting vaccinated requested, going back wearing masks again. also don’t understand immune system works. new variant gets vaccine starts rolling youll line get infected. itll mutate excellent. means outbreaks heavy restrictions won’t required state. Sounds like you’ve duped hysteria fear mongering. bought hook line sinker. 99% people survive something hardly death lottery. Floridian 
It sucks seeing many people know deny vaccine many excuses. 
The younger say survive neglect next person possibly give can’t. 
The older people getting it. 
I would feel like absolute shit give COVID anyone whether died hate people inconsiderate strands

you lost pretense credibility one. 
everything said point taken bullshit. Kudos using word ameliorating. really use often.  living? Quite people work manual labor jobs genuinely hot environments wearing mask plain awful.

Edit: also, understand risk vaccinated individuals LOW, even taking variants consideration. point would okay live life covid?

Like jiu jitsu serious chance still get covid?

Like individual vaccinated stage caution longer necessary?  I’m glad did. it’s worth think you’ll ok price getting could school job travel sports concerts. difference 95% 80% massive. 4X likely experience symptoms before. Thanks USA guinea pigs one! Probably one countries super high vaccination Pfizer, little restrictions let anyone come including Delta variant.

Next weeks interesting. Hopefully good news interesting.

Getting updated science guide policy default model evidence so, drag feet facts things get control. May strongest work item win! vaccinated it’s fully effective? Fuck em? Last heard delta-variant solve kid problem. Ugh hope doesn’t turn centralia. Think like this. We’re family trip science public health parents rest us kids back seats. kids quietly along ride, kids absolute fit dumping fries milkshakes seats, us behaving repeatedly asking “are yet?”

The problem map mom dad using isn’t great. It’s kind like adventure video games like Far Cry, map clear places you’ve already still shrouded clouds places yet see. Sure, you’ve got target destination landmarks clouded section aiming for, idea path straight line windy hell. Heck, don’t even know final destination marked map actual final destination. don’t know along way set us back.

I know it’s frustrating, it’s impossible identify actual end date pandemic day arrives, especially world still unvaccinated. dramatic. always chance evolution would lead variant vaccines less effective against. people didn’t take seriously disease incubated countless people vaccine resistant variants popping up.  amazing even *year+* people still understand this. local governments good getting word vaccine easy get providing little information. specifically targeting communities vaccine outreach let know vaccine information gathered safe used purpose.

We know GOP controlled areas interest least liberal areas, major effort now. Pop clinics vaccine outreach low income communities vastly minorities definitely needed. happens when/if “exit strategy”? Maybe time next pandemic one that? assuming you’ll get “go back normal” pretty naïve imo. Got vaccines yet, ""normal"" person ? Yep! Kiddo came cold last week guess whose turn week? portuguese say people 16-28 dumb precautions.
(With exception's)

Just opinion course. KNOW THAT. Stop making assumptions.  downvote like facts. infected twice, PCR tests prove it. living immediate co-worker someone positive test first time, person living got sick symptoms, got sick. Incubation periods lined up.

I'm Biologist Virology expertise pre-med (later career change) soon 3 graduate degrees: know frick I'm talking incubation periods work.

Also, re-infections leading worse outcomes 2nd time reported far back August get downvoted 'people discussing year' funny never see mention it, one mask greatest protection. Use two three(seriously, three almost n95 proetection). personally use two cover bandana. own. Well vaccinated. I've kinda relaxed since then, I'm state delta prominent (yet) I'm waiting get stressful anxiety inducing behavior going again. FDA responsible right people look stats it’s incredibly rare. anti vaxxers run evidence never get it. It’s proportion doubled, news many people continue give impression actual figure. different metrics. That's I'm sticking masks far beyond Covid. crowded public space like transit, etc. Also handwashing. physical issues cannot even see doctor. Compounding physical mental issues.... I’m done. Side effects. small risk heart inflammation young males second dose mRNA vaccines. Single dose 94% effective delta variant, people prefer take risk. Oh ... realize Covid nothing Flu ...

Good. Time go Singapore obvious table comment, provided blanket statement. Nowhere specific comment thread specified young people considered. 

A 115 year old would probably refuse vaccine reason people refusing vaccine: understanding risks benefits.  People slightly timid year half worst pandemic hundred years, makes weird you.

You, however, encourage people worst pandemic hundred years “go live lives” six million (and climbing) people died still extensive risk factors, that’s weird.

Oh, Reddit. still wear mask stores, gas stations, etc. really don’t go eat that’s frugal nature w 4 kids (so expensive). I’m tired masks too. exhausting. FYI they're chemicals. China WHO: keep Americans scared, economy ropes, sucking printed money like dying man gasping air. danger over, relatively speaking. Except false negative especially depending timing ship definitely sailed. California, reinstatement maskandate restrictions ensure governor gets recalled, end, political career important.  hospitalization, symptomatic infection, infection, efficacy numbers dropping significantly AstraZeneca, Moderna, BioNtech, Sinovac, Sinopharm, J&amp;J.

You cite infection symptomatic infection data. cite hospitalization data, claim ""dropping significantly"".

From link posted:

""Both Oxford–AstraZeneca Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines effective reducing risk SARS-CoV-2 infection COVID-19 hospitalisation people Delta VOC, effects infection appeared diminished compared Alpha VOC. insufficient numbers hospital admissions compare vaccines respect.""

We need see data this. variant much transmissible vaccinated people largely protected (even show cold-like symptoms days) know big deal is. correct masks preventing others getting sick, especially regarding covid. do, however, protect wearer colds flu; barrier droplets deterrent fomites touching one's nose mouth. I'm expert 30 years wearing masks RN prevented getting infected kinds pathogens. It’s complete opposite Reddit lol. figures still highly effective yet many pretend not. 

88% efficacy symptomatic infection simply phenomenal. Posting sort figures completely invalidates point trying made.  Really someone cold work period. got work someone cold, going get it. Masks work personal defense like that. know people are, strap three face almost comparable n95, safe!  Great news, although weekend always underreporting.. lets hope see weekdays well Technically, always true.  awwwwww Guess half population take agency health either get vaccinated continue take precautions ineligible. EU completely shut borders Russia... nobody allowed there, nobody allowed Russia. heading full-scale third wave chaotic government measures combined low vaccination rates. Truly successful. Flu vaccines something like 50% efficiacy. truly amazing. zero antibodies second dose blood donation. Either blood tests stink military shooting sugar water arm again. wonder many actually Delta variant? Apparently younger people feels like bad cold traditional covid symptoms Chris Paul Good you. think pre-2020 pandemic plans garbage, realistic. said can't stop pandemic-level respiratory virus, try keep life normal possible closing things absolutely necessary. live 1918, course, know restrictions short targeted mostly reactive -- be, even 20 years ago we'd never able remote work schooling scale.

I can't prove, course, suppression worked countries ""did right"" (though look places succeeded suppression, think policy enough explain it). maybe would even death done much, though again, that's difficult prove.

But fact countries stop COVID ever contemplated before, 15 months later, even vaccines, they're closer standard set lifting restrictions. can't blame anyone thinks forever, unless change standard. H2O large range immune compromised. Many able live almost normal lives, making sure take extra precautions flu season ask close contact stay date vaccines. good treatments flu, etc get sick. still good treatments Covid. mean, willing get vaccine think restrictions extreme. Opinions nuanced, know. New York Times subscribe make account. THIS. people can't get time off, could take time can't afford it. Taking day even hour much less money pay rent, utilities, food, transportation, etc. really sucks. enjoying going more. lol nope vaccines effective transmitting virus (delta variant), long Covid? know effective hospitalizations deaths concerns.

I’m really hoping vaccines still depress cases. I’m comfortable half population sitting ducks delta variant, even I’m personally okay. Lol appreciate advice. I've trying recommended exposure therapy steps- look photos, alcohol swab, hold needle, etc., baby steps get used it. I'll hit panic level literally throw chair ground push away see nurse try get corner eye I'm paying attention I've got lot work I'm capable relaxing Yes, good thing vaccines work well it! I’m talking miracle variant evades vaccines perfectly certain people seem think happen. don’t understand sub suddenly convinced Delta essentially brand new pandemic

Crippling anxiety disorders confirmation bias.  PCP allergist agreed candidate Dr. William Schaffner Vanderbilt helped research develop vaccine Covid vaccine allergic vaccines including tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles chicken pox vaccine. I’m also allergic forms injectable medications due preservatives use. It’s risky I’m going risk life vaccine. I’m ok wear mask, social distance, wash hands regularly use hand sanitizer. I'm curious say get first shot, people got 1st shot second shot months, way past 3 week period, get 1st shot again? go inside pee wear mask  Head german RKI, Lothar Wieler, probably comparable Fauci US, said yesterday breaking upcoming wave autmumn vaccinations enough, measures need place like mask mandate buildings, public transport, yknow, basics.

There several treatment studies undergo. allowed say that. Mods removed post talking China bot programs downvoting. Claimed uncivil saying that. know, need downvote. Lateral Blow test shit? already knew this.  Considering billions unvaccinated people world next years, genuinely don’t think it’s worth vaccinated Americans wear mask don’t want even reading you’re response. Even masked 5 years, virus we’ll exposed point lifetime. smart thing get vaccinated, stay top boosters necessary. Life improved considerably much past month, given well state doing, wouldn’t give up. WHO's statement vaccinated people wear masks evidence-based? I've Astra Zenica vaccinations managed catch good ol' Covid. comparable situation. We’re dealing virus, variant current vaccines effective against.

Unless I’m seriously missing something, don’t understand sub suddenly convinced Delta essentially brand new pandemic.  Plus, reduce risk catching mutating Covid something virulent able get past vaccines - that’s huge reason healthy young need get vaccinated. 

Judging say age health getting vaccinated helping bit, you’re helping wider society hugely. Thanks! It’s quite literally Delta hub. smarter doctors say that’s enough. don’t know think know better world health organization. basis decide pandemic last 18 months that’s amount time 1918 Flu pandemic lasted? It’s even pathogen.  time, attended lovely outdoor food drink festival town rest population outenjoying day shopping, eating socialising had, not, totally voluntary vaccinations. people really nutters point. get senses back blow nose. That's happens Covid. Difference clear evidence-based situation serious February 2020.

Vaccinated people needing wear masks evidence based. Yes course, vaccines like one way another, ex: chicken pox vaccine might still milder form.
This even medical news, basic science ed you’re thought school. Everyone get paid sick time, period. Even weeks worth year.

Even health issue that's contagious disease, supposed rest health, fucking able to. wanted vaccine keep hospital morgue.

That's exactly head at, too. ever catch it, take cold. keeping family hospitals ask for. vaccines prevent (even new mutations), that's enough me. efficacy usually measuring hospitalization rates? Again, death rates important moral justification say otherwise. You’re missing point.

Yes, SEVERE illness well near eliminated vaccinated individuals. 30 people hospital amazing considering used be.

Though critical patients one thing, patients actually contracting COVID still experiencing negative effects another.  Something prolonged mask recommendation (not even mandate) would prolonged.

Other commenters thread talk lost taste smell, wife’s friend well nearly 6 weeks ago post 2nd vaccine. (I think like many people still getting sick) surprised could happen it’s broadcast overseeing disease recommendation.  specifically made point tell friends family continue mask since either (or husband) gave kids young vax.

So yeah, mean hear critical illness down, that’s heroic feat, half battle Well leaders lie people die pretty upsetting. apathetic face murderous callousness? CDC considers fully vaccinated 2 weeks second shot. didn’t meet standards pandemic hadn’t spread much (that knew of). meet standards epidemic, believe call it. kind vaccination cause inflammation. Soreness swelling considered normal vaccines. Flu shot every time. stop worrying vaccination status care die Yes two people wearing mask better 1 immunocompromised. normal situation like flu norovirus. harder avoid covid pandemic. need help cancer patient organ transplant patient die horrible death covid happy wear mask go numbers closer zero. 

I immunosuppressed family friends doctors tell go anywhere anything anyone covid numbers zero. obviously possible immensely stressful time immunocompromised. many illnesses kill them, one decent enough numbers still scary. 

I get can't protect everyone everything, saying close country immunocompromised people. Wearing mask really simple happy longer that's would keep even 1 immunocompromised person getting sick dying ventilator alone hospital fighting sickness good chunk life.  ""I trust organization's warnings they've insufficiently cautious"" attitude makes goddamn sense. We're basically demanding variant problem. like people hear want hear. drop sub anti-mask brigade targeting back late summer. free continue wearing masks needed. Yep. Unless like nobody around therapist's waiting room, I've got public. Went 2 stores today masks customers staff one store wore them. I've vaccinated rest household isn't, I'm cautious. Personally I've kept wearing masks large groups since March last year. Even early on, advice needed seemed bit reckless. standard safety practice err side caution proven safe? CDC call drop seemed like lassie faire feeling would happen. Vaccines amazing tools help spread perfect, especially implementation/vaccine rates remain low. know want over, still much thing despite people feeling burnt out. listen little shit Maybe people want get sick. That's really call. That’s gonna dog. Vaxd since December.   venn diagram mask over-consume over-pollute single circle

I think life .1% humanity shit load people wearing comfortable device helps filter disease, contaminants stench stale-indoor air low price pay save many people.

This someone wearing masks Tropical Climates (surgical disposable masks almost necessity, cotton cloth feels asphyxiating).

With due respect, need get perspective. need learn value fellow humans little you’re valuing now. spend billions fighting diseases kill less that. need thrive live happier lives.

So wear surgical disposable masks (or reusable cotton ones climate allows). Surgical masks help: cheap, comfortable, biodegradable, sustainable demonstrably help eradicate disease (some flu strains eradicated thanks widespread use masks indoors less one year). We’d save lives covid more, would huge net positive.

Fuck, would thought anyone could think killing one every thousand human beings alive today totally reasonable sacrifice right sneeze others. things considered, heads following measures. also people went easy way follow rules all. also panic attacks health anxiety. Gradual exposure social events going outside, reduced somewhat. Combined act, cbt nature / meditation Who=CCP I'm already vaxxed. mask me. Win win! Singapore. Many fully vaccinated. primarily use Pfizer Moderna. click see fully vaccinated got infected spread virus others. also see many people asymptomatic. 

This eye opener me.  never stopped. didnt notice many unknowns day day developments either werent paying attention gave due fatigue.



Mask carry on. India ppl getting flesh eating disease battling Delta variant vaccinations. Let's honest many yokels Missouri also refused get vaccinated day average less 5,000 cases significant amount random testing

I think that's problem. Covid gets less pronounced testing sporadic. I've always focused deaths. Even states like Florida hard time covering gets significant.  

Long term complications though something undefined. understand way high fevers even flu long term damaging effects severe, I'm really sure position actually quantify that. Personally I'm willing things 'what if' basis. need compelling reasons data I'm seeing it.

Someone pointed stop masking children get vaccinated.  would turn around say keep masking children get vaccinated. really oily face that’s prone acne. I’ve tons discoloration scars since pandemic started added moisture heat increased amount get. want skin heal, know? ship sailed people. don’t cold though. He's right though. Every country requires negative pcr test vaccination record.

The EU playing politics. Delta everywhere, even Australia Hong Kong Christ's sake! didn’t lose credibility leadership definitely suspect point onwards. dont understand last paragraph. people following restrictions? Nah I'm good Same. don’t like masks (who does?) absolutely wear it’s required. issues  thanks. I’m fully vaccinated I’m going back wearing masks. Great rebuttal. 

I care believes UFO's, he's correct this. I'm wearing mask fully vaccinated. goddamn us surgeon general. another researcher (with PhD) biological sciences worked stuff like protein engineering adaptive laboratory evolution (if gotta throw crap around), disagree you. Absolutely ""fearmongering"". really many publications yet piece together model Delta variant means pandemic whole there's virtually data. know that:

- R0 lot higher Delta
- Viral load higher
- Vaccine effectiveness across board reduced Delta, massively one dose significantly less (but still decent, yes - lower) 2 dose.

Putting together, stands reason (1) breakthrough cases vaccinated, (2) transmission chains involving vaccinated individuals, (3) lifting restrictions greatly enhance transmission overall. fact data UK indicate predominantly Alpha cases, less transmissible Delta, 40% reduction household transmission positive index case vaccinated vs unvaccinated. that's eroded even likely. children 12 unvaccinated fault own, unvaccinated choice definitely messed everyone create much problem choice. Nothing though since can't really force them. think continuing masking totally reasonable thing suggest absolutely ""science"" tells truly necessary. One infer things much worse without it, however. Like everyone age 12? Everyone seems forgetting them… Yes, Moderna #1 #2 0.5ml, Pfizer Dosage: 0.3 mL (for 18+) already anyway still social distancing. Partially safety, partially hate people. insane? wearing mask big fucking deal? 

If cases start going up, I’m going put one on. It’s like life drastically becomes different unbearable mask on. Given political system built local politicians keeping big guys happy, I'm sure first response hide outbreak. probably happened way chain, big hide.  not. 

I tried make clear possible anti-mask. trying rebut mask wearing. 

Again, *want* good responsible citizen. able get vaccinated earlier due diabetes. 

and ""wearing mask."" can't fully explain you, wear mask, military ""constant vigilance"" kicks in, even complicated that. pandemic *fear.* Fear fellow man woman. Fear outside. 

I know live like that. tried year destroyed me.

Make mistake, absolutely wear mask, will, science read saying vaccine still holding delta variant.  Indeed. Yes, bringing home right cutting group created administration one petty shortsighted decisions laundry list them. absolutely assumed cost lives. Probably many lives. Today first time since pandemic started fiancé went restaurant. fully vaccinated first time finally took masks lunch. Reading feels like punch gut. Honestly really uncomfortable. kids age 12? supposed throw hands say oh well, masks annoying? honestly started wearing masks four years ago fire season California, hell yeah wear mask cold lol. know masks.... smartarse. 2022 go!!!  virus never ends

It transmits friend local laws, especially rural conservative areas zero limitations. back normal far country concerned. CDC dropped mask requirements said vaccines effective delta variety   What's stopping development cold vaccine flu? grace Pfizer go I. Yes, decent coverage. remaining 30% potentially bad time concern.

If goes way, hard say assume point, hard avoid chaos - even directly affect you.

What rational assume Delta eating market share others, largely declining anyway. believe become visible that, own, sadly - find new territory 30%, along many unlucky ones outside it.  No. Normal-ish good enough.

I’m American, anti-Americanisms don’t apply. I’m going live constant fear variant may never exist, I’m going wear mask every time hay fever flare up. elimination Covid Australia

So, I’m trying see dangers help keep kiddo safe? First time June last year. Took til november even begin mild/light exercise even minutes time. Got sick march year, relapse badly exercise still plugging away. coming friday 2 week timer second dose. way waiting 90 days post symptoms. never stopped symptoms. vaccines I've noticed reduction chills, night sweats random pop fevers. Here’s problem. Covid vaccine ineffective flu vaccine, we’d fucked. saying “it’s big deal, even flu vaccine breakthrough cases” isn’t reassuring all. it’s useless statement Covid much threat flu. one saying lockdown forever simply need cautious opening everything prematurely. 

And matter scared, taking reasonable precautions. example, afraid Salmonella, want get family sick take reasonable precautions.

The ""you people want lockdowns forever"" ""you're afraid"" talking points utter nonsense. I’ve gotten two colds past month, first time getting type sickness year… need get mask says Vaxxed relaxed don’t think it’s 5% chance get covid. vaccine efficiency 95% means cases reduced 95% compared unvaccinated population. Say live 20% probability exposed enough covid get (without vaccine). vaccinated, goes 20*(1-.95)=1% chance. think 5% vaccinated people get covid means community transmission basically 100%. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

But talking epidemy, sometimes sensible talk term absolute numbers. know virus lot likely fatal people 85 vaccinated. People 85 Belgium vaccinated large majority people residing outside Brussels. vaccination strategy reduce mortality virus, absolute number unvaccinated 85+ people taken account. Roughly 5000 people correspond category Brussels, 25 000 Flanders. 5 times people one risk category Flanders Brussels. trend also seen number people died Belgium, covid, lot larger Flanders Brussels.

So yeah, maybe percentage 85+ people vaccinated Flanders higher Brussels, still lot people risk Flanders Brussels. counts end day.

The thing important potential virus mutate depend percentage people likely catch covid, absolute circulation virus. 10% population 10 000 people less lilkely lead mutations thant 2% population 100 000 people.

About readiness people get vaccinated, agree. That's talked fact people Brussels less enclined follow preventive health campaign general trend, even matters related covid. also put perspective fact Brussels' population lot younger rest country, even though partially explains trend. yeah, older population tends see doctors younger generation.

One also note Wallonia opened vaccination campaign young people quite early well (actually earlier Brussels Flanders), vaccination rates good Flanders', even though they're still good globally. indicates finished vaccinating willing elder people quite fast well.

And yeah, 50% elders get vaccinated region 5000 elders, would dramatic 30% elders get vaccinated region 50 000 elders. first case, that's 2500 potential hospitalisations, second case, that's 15 000 potential hospitalisations. end day, counts. 2500 hospitalisations lot manageable 15 000, definetly leads less deaths. problem pandemic percentage people died regards population, absolute number people died. means protect people, individual dies covid could vaccinated, someone died.

Using percentage instead absolute number strategy downplaying seriousness pandemic, people talking mortality rate low, anything stop pandemic. people complitely forgot put numbers perspective (which main problem comes people using statistics right), even though mortality rate low, contagiousness disease high, lot death avoidable.

Here same, sensible talk terms percentages, without context. Especially Flanders Wallonia vasts regions, counts several big towns. nothing says towns Flanders/Wallonia vaccination rate distribution countryside looking global statistics. Although true Flanders, big town higher vaccination rates 65+ Brussels, much big gap. Antwerpen 87% vaccination rate (first dose) 65+, Woluwe saint pierre 85%, Auderghem Watermael 83%, Woluwe saint lamber 82%. time, Liège 81% vaccination rate 65+, Charleroi 78%.

It seems general trends people city getting less vaccinated people countryside. Even though seems Flanders, vaccination rate better amongst elderly, 61.5% people 65 Belgium live Flanders. (That's 1.4 people Flanders, 687 000 Wallonia, 160 000 Brussels). Actually, break down, unvaccinated 65+ distributed follow Belgium :

* 17,9 % Brussels
* 34,7 % Flanders
* 49,9 % Wallonia

Edit : used IBSA &amp; Statbel 2020 population breakdown age classes calculations here. Heard Thats stats. Although right even vaccine 100% ""covered"", 5% chances getting sick covid. chances much lower depend many factors, vaccination status one. *Ehh*, Canadian Ontario here. got 2nd dose yesterday, friends GTA fully vaccinated past month 'hot spots' got pushed waitlist bit quicker. 

Come Monday, anyone 18 book 2nd shot Ontario. We're trying *really hard* save part summer 🤞 COVID vaccine, like vaccine, 100% effective? Getting hung inclusion flu point comparison particularly constructive. young child take care almost help. family 5000+ miles away baby daddy isn’t around much anymore. first vaccine (AZ) knocked ass three days looking forward repeating that. travel again, don’t really know it’s worth it, especially getting AZ under-40 woman. heard long term side effects relation menstrual cycle top everything else. 

Try fever, chills, severe back pain, sweats, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea chasing around mobile (crawling walking) 9 month old. haven’t sick decade. excited experience again? know several unvaccinated people ditched masks required ""vaccinated"" people, wink-wink.

Honestly, CDC realize would common response? least mask mandates dropped, anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers easily-spotted. they're invisible. Basically. Don’t mean building? people downvoting comment? Yawn

I got covid despite wearing mask, antibodies. went ahead got vaccine anyway. 

I’m going back wearing mask. It’s hot hell live hate seeing peoples faces trouble hearing them. scientists signed Lancet letter denouncing consideration anything natural origins since said open lab involvement. One, Bernard Roizman, emeritus virologist University Chicago four honorary professorships Chinese universities, said leaning toward believing lab accident.  convinced happened virus brought lab, started work it,” told Wall Street Journal, “and sloppy individual brought out.” added, “They can’t admit something stupid.”   Calisher Colorado State University, another signatory, recently told ABC News “there much coincidence” ignore lab-leak theory believes “it likely came lab.”   Palese, virologist wrote 1977 flu pandemic, said “a lot disturbing information surfaced since Lancet letter signed” wants investigation come answers.   scientists also said changed minds. One, James Le Duc, recently retired director Galveston National Laboratory, major lab studies coronavirus trained many Wuhan biosafety specialists, said May “important look closely laboratory conditions explore done serious investigation.”   Lipkin, director Center Infection Immunity Columbia University co-author influential article Nature Medicine argued favor natural origin March 2020, also skeptical. “People looking bat viruses BSL-2 labs,” told science reporter Donald G. McNeil Jr. last month. “My view changed.”

New information demands new considerations, doubling burying heads sand.

Furthermore, illustrates wider global issue lab regulations controversial pathogen studies mistakes could (and been) made scientists multiple countries. That’s great! keep seeing scientists “believe” lower viral load means less transmission, actual studies verifying it. link studies you’ve seen? It’d great comfort read. 

Btw, it’s 90% effective situations would otherwise 100%. study tracking people vaxxed, controlling tracking come contact with. So, mix people contact virus weren’t, go normal lives. means it’s actually higher 10% chance asymptomatic carrier actually come contact someone coronavirus. like masks 100% either, one other.

I'd rather defenses one. I’m veteran, Pentagon attacked 20 years ago pandemic really destroyed mental health. reignited PTSD fully barely made through. feel I’m glad made it. lost credibility comes mask wearing know better tell something help protect around me, will. Keep pushing big guberment scary shit tho. freethinker/s Good thing health insurance directly tied employment, economy shuts aga... Oh fuck Reaching 25 per 100,000 per 14 days threshold eminently attainable, though. that, contact tracing becomes feasible odds mutations occurring significantly lower people contracting virus.   Same. commonsense guide. lost faith CDC. CDC crying loud. Caps. Cute. I’m blocking now. understand feel. think simultaneous double whammy variant infectious plus us needed vaccinated/seropositive people hoped prevent outbreaks. you’re United States, feel it’s inevitable least couple restrictions restored, likely indoor masking. is, course, area dependent. San Francisco already discussing reimplementation that, time doubt states like Arkansas anything, say nothing Florida. We’ll information whether delta infected vaccinated people spread it, hopefully policy reflect information. 

All said, don’t think you’re going need personally worry you’re vaccinated. Though we’ve seen breakthrough infections, it’s clear happens often otherwise. Further, every breakthrough infection I’ve heard results either nothing positive test extremely mild course disease. don’t think way likely vaccinated person risk like unvaccinated person, I’d even go far say Delta infection probably poses essentially risk someone who’s vaccinated. got rid TB western world 30% effective vaccine. dare say declaw Covid 90% effective one. key thing make sure close interaction vaccinated. 

For UK Israel we’re explosive part waves, that’s scariest part. them, also first post vaccine surge, we’re always going cautious coming hell far away it. Hang there. Vaccines still way out, unless you’ve got something says otherwise, reason confident yours. Wearing mask bothered me.   long 40% people world vaccinating, virus keep mutating keep danger unvaccinated mostly. n95s, curious Maybe convince people wear mask feel sick, society large give people shit either.

People already vaccinated probably easier convinced good idea. perfect it'll help. Hopefully.. Yikes! Thank pointing out! leaving sheer blind luck contribute to, catch, variant makes meaningless. 

Or could wear napkin mouth sometimes. 

It's hard decision unless think glob proteins gives shit think ""fair."" fair, would gladly payed 5 buck price first dose instead wait six months. opposed performance drop COVID could cause?

False dichotomy what? Plenty people California believed it, that’s presented state government media.  Indoor restos f'in scary man...no way ventilation anything better 40 year old system hasnt cleaned years, want us remove masks eat inside around 45 min? thanks. wear masks, stay home follow quarantine protocol? (In us). No. lot people chose to. that’s shit still around. Maybe people had, would different story. stores finding loopholes stay open “essential”. Businesses secret workouts basements spite lockdown..those things many others allowed virus continue on. Selfishness made much drawn needed be. Serious question: what's big deal wearing mask supermarket? I'm trying judgmental - want understand logic, makes little sense me. long keeps people safe, could shop mask long needed.

As long businesses shut down, can't see masking little longer public affecting people negative way. bit cloth face. never stopped know 5% vaccine help. Facts equal hysteria. 

You like facts here. 

Therefore, call hysteria.

That chain events. No. People aren’t idiots mask again. People didn’t wear masks won’t again, they’ll die. They’ll die worse before, pity won’t found. in-n-out (for first time year) sign door saying fully vaccinated need wear masks, unlike place say unvaccinated need wear masks. everyone eating mask on. employees masks. think saw two people come without mask dozen walked there. people ordering drive thru wearing masks, too. Continue wear fabric mouth nose save people illness? Sure, anyone wouldn’t asshole.

Her arm works perfectly now. LSD rewired brain able use arm. still blows mind. delta plus. Already both.

There’s guarantee they’re equally effective delta.

Covid seem worse though long term impacts appear impacting lot people. share sentiment… variant caught recently circulating quite now. knows next variant may hold.

I playing safe blows don’t see light end tunnel yet… American thing guess

‘Its nearly us must world’  smell come back?? first point fair, I'm sure second point. One reason restrictions gone long much public opposition -- polls show even harsher restrictions still pretty popular (in part because, see Matt Hancock, everyone knows break rules want to).

So people want restrictions end, mass protesting one way it. may work -- mass protests often -- one way putting pressure government. Yeah course lot patients know it, first sign heart attack usually last. turned new van. Anti vaxxer’s care long term Covid side effects. don’t make fucking sense. also _kinda_ mixing cause effect.

I'm curious, old You? agree article neglects complexity around issue fact good evidence vaccine's effectiveness. Elderly people make first second doses, number people vaccinated going primarily old people, much higher death rate 2% take vaccines equation. can't compare death rate entire population death rate partially vaccinated claim vaccines effect vaccinated group skews older.

Also plenty data showing spring wave driven almost entirely younger unvaccinated people barely blip age groups prioritized vaccination. previous waves, peak infections among elderly age groups matched exceeded younger age groups.

The virus deadly. worse hospitalization rate. needed flatten curve ensure medical resources crumble.

People fought lockdowns masks.

Flattening curve never really happened \^ (shocked Pikachu)

We miraculously developed vaccine.

A significant chunk people refused take it.

Our half-measure lockdowns lax mask enforcement coupled anti-vaxxers allowed virus continue mutating.

We delta variant diminished vaccine efficacy extent.

People asked careful mutations could erase progress, worse, leave us something significantly dangerous original variants.

And people crying storm acting like one understands hard you. hard us. adult.

You ever heard Great Filter. Congrats, creatures like likely part it.  sense smell likely gone grey matter shrinking especially areas smell taste It’s like think virus magically disappear that.

It's want, proves easy people manipulate. vast majority getting vaccine stop virus spreading earnestly want protect themselves, they're getting vaccine see way make everybody shut let go bar. I’m glad agree masks useful.

As lockdowns vs. simple top recommendation (keyword recommended) state disease control center, worlds freedom normalcy difference.

Both even lower spread, though point, don’t need lockdown.  However, people still contracting getting sick COVID, 21% exact Pfizer / Moderna metrics positivity, 12% symptomatic, 4% severe illness.  

So recommend caution? masks absolutely demolish normalcy? mean, wasn’t fun, it’s height wasn’t horrible.  

Again, personally 2nd vaxxed friend nearly 2 months sensory loss.  Reading handful comments thread, I’m seeing many others.  Ask they’d recommend still wear mask.  guess answer another reason masks regular thing on. mention almost like fashion accessory point. feeling anxiety/Paranoia Delta variant, best advice give honestly leave sub. US worse wave Covid winter example, even notice cause break sub concerns worry about.

Hell even went short Florida trip early January, nothing happened me. Anyone strictly adheres they're told clever. science change all; they'll tell parts science want know about, leave lie parts don't.

Just take people something gain manipulating face value use brain. there's disease choices maybe protect yourslef mask, nothing, logical choice one thing power *might* help. need scientist doctor tell something try, literally consequences trying potential gains. really like point number 2 - getting time work you’ve vaccinated. Even typical vaccines, like flu stuff.

Think it, science technology progress it’s usually employers, working class, reaps rewards. New tech lets employees work less time, since employee paid based time spent instead value produced continue working amount pay employer gets economic benefit. Working class get secondary benefit product company produces sold less (as long fair market working properly companies compete sell products lowering price, isn’t always case). part, benefit new technology goes employer. best, employee works amount pay, worse cases get fired technology made redundant.

Now look vaccines. Without them, employees catch flu call sick work. Depending employer, might get paid time might not. either way, employer loses employees time. PTO, lose money. not, it’s still pretty inconvenient unpredictable schedule change like that. employee’s end, partially loses time well. They’re sick feeling miserable can’t really want since they’re staying home rest.

Now consider happens vaccine. There’s probably estimate sick days per year per employee flu causes without vaccinations. Consider days, employee doesn’t get sick anymore, employer doesn’t deal last minute schedule changes paying employee time worked. employee work doesn’t get spend time watching Netflix. They’re sick, healthy time goes straight back employer, gets x days productivity employee. employer gives PTO sick days, there’s financial difference employee. They’ve simply traded sick work. It’s little ambiguous better. sucks sick, sometimes flu mild work mentally draining stressful, time work welcome break, even you’re sick. employer doesn’t PTO sick days, yes, employee ends better financially longer lose pay sick.

Now imagine took estimated average sick days per year per employee caused flu, everyone got flu vaccine entitled many days PTO. Now, instead employer yet reaping benefits technological (or case medical) advances, **for once** working class would get benefit. employer wouldn’t even lose much, since without vaccine would deal sick employees anyway. countries they’re actually required give PTO sick days they’d lose nothing, even gain predictability able schedule PTO advance needing deal flu hitting workforce once, tends do. countries companies don’t PTO sick days, yeah employer lose pay time worked, tbh kinds policies kind fucked begin with, imho, it’s long past time PTO became little normalized.

How determine 15,000 cases high? like 11-12000 now, pedantic. little detail we're talking 328 million people. Can't venue certain time.

Can't travel without permission.

Must wear masks indoors although prevelance low.

Can't attend outdoor events large crowds.

Can't contact sports.

Not agree disagree these. short list vast amount restrictions place.

I pointing emphasis anti-vax reason people protesting misguided. 

Don't take personally. There’s problem. Knowingly cold mingling people like it’s fine. Covid cold, you’re sick, friends &amp; family &amp; coworkers favor &amp; stay F home! Don’t selfish twat. Canada 25% fully vaccinated, 29% eligible (12+). wrong? go there.

Edit : numbers going down, still follow facts That’s lot better “everyone bed ridden week grandma died” believe masks also reduced numbers cases well (perhaps differ here).

I think you’re trying paint anti masker, I’m not. wore mask since March 2020 refused anything outside house besides work cases started spiking November got vaccinated April. Mask critical tool slowing spread virus crippling America.

But let’s real, wasn’t zero cost sacrifice. goal entire year eventually resume normalcy, insisted mask use knew normalcy impossible high levels Covid circulating throughout society. now? Even zero Covid rules state people acting normal Covid still hasn’t able harm us like last year took vaccinations seriously. you’re goal reduce cases you’re concerned restoring quality life, I’m confused wouldn’t also advocate lock downs stop spread. That’s bit different, flu vaccine covers four variants dozens exposed to.

It considered unusual vaccinated polio measles still get it, example. Agreed. Iike remind people diabetic expected live 80 without covid. tend stop talking that. 4th dose? Fuck I’ll pass anyone wants go back normal wear masks forever heartless monster wants kill people.

Ya'll seen heartless monsters arguments always end ""Well *I'M* wearing mask anymore! *I'M* going live *MY* life! Stay basement want to!""

We're pointing arguments come position making feel good, ego. topic really matter, kind perspective always cause friction. Yes. think it’s unreasonable assume *every* pharmacy *entire* world someone infectious virus kind. specifically it’s experts say it’s okay to. don’t assume know them. amateur take, see 15,000 new cases everyday, it’s definitely progress don’t think it’s time end masking public transit things like that. Especially delta variant rising causing Israel (with high vaccine rate) calling indoor masking again. need sacrifice lives mental health disgusting. I'm curious better partnership would turned out. can't imagine AstraZeneca happy bothered. 

That said, I'm still waiting promised massive influx Johnson Johnson vaccine production come Merck partnership abandoned vaccine. Compared vaccines, masks fuckall. wore masks vaccinated.

I’ve got vaccine, I’ve done part.

People trying right thing may wind slipping annoyance rage irresponsible people waste everything responsible people sacrificed. get started kids trials please! What's medical daycare centre? within hospital sick kids go play? FUCK THAT. Raw dogging air first time year half amazing. Get vaccinated get fucked. Scientific evidence ""controlling narrative"" lol, get crazy conspiracy shit here, stop trying subtle it. Yeah, seeing increase deaths countries. seeing pretty sharp uptick infections UK though. However, reports Delta variant dominant strain UK long time now. still wear mine unless stranger nearby jog. fairly comfortable sports mask got costco hard wear. Even Bay Area, still cases despite 81% 12+ least 1 dose vaccine. No.

It’s also forgone conclusion won’t new variants reinfect often cause breakthrough infections.


Think like camp fire burned evening, even throwing whole bucket water doesn’t guarantee fire won’t restart. That’s use fire pit fire ring.  

Reducing initial viral dose also helps reduce infection severity, vaccinated helps also.

A bulletproof vest doesn’t make immune bullets. Avoid war zones dangerous situations. (Stay super packed bars gyms unvaccinated people gather high risk things.) someone shooting you, hide behind stuff. (Wear mask), leave.

Going bank bit risky you’re going people known rob banks. pretty clear closer circles vaccinated now, isn’t engaging risky behaviors.  *Mask booster every 6 months would bet life it. mean look comment section. People acting like sky falling saying might kill wear cloth mask face again. Exactly! That's part reason manage country (Australia) long time. also concerned people use proudly cases could potentially increase transmission (wearing masks long, touching spreading covid everywhere fingers). lucky country good positron covidwise though, major outbreak June 2020 mostly 1 state eradicated months. area like Covid never happened. mandates, signage, one wears mask anymore. can't see anything bringing widespread mask wearing back besides another full blown pandemic. Oh god would never guessed Per Capita list. agree. don’t understand wearing mask indoors public ever big deal. never bothered me. People act like asked wear ball chain. may sound flippant point need start measuring quality life quantity. time time ya know. understand specifically started calling ""delta variant"" reduce racism, chauvenism nationalism, originate India. incredibly densely packed nation lots pockets poverty sub-standard sanitation medical care- currently ruled anti-intellectual regime. Places like *perfect* places diseases spread mutate think getting Americans Britons vaccinated hard, even harder India. long places like remain unvaccinated (and Indian people, large, refusing take vaccines, distribution uneven) we're gonna see deadly, virulent variants. Yeah trying get people already vaccinated wearing masks shitshow. Even data backs up, emotional level, it’s going feel like flip flopping goalpost moving, lot vaccinated people won’t want go back masks anger anti vax idiots. * 150m vaccinated
* Fast forward 100 years
* Holy shit, 150m people died vaccinated!! many times wrong this. guess confirming yo masks required getting fully vaccinated. Fuck stupidity WHO. see cases increasing hell about. steady decline.  Yeah take seat shut hell up. ""nO EvIdeNcE HuMaN hUmAn TrAnSmIsSiOn"" part bullshit? first sentence, lived experience know nothing about; second one, irrefutable truth?   someone public without mask, socializing they're unvaccinated, get sick die, promise feel sorry them. ship empathy long burned sunk bottom sea. So, vaccines every month surprise, viruses mutate? Jesus christ, fucking covid god damn pain ass.  Nah. ""life put hold""… wearing masks? needful!

Edit: Revert! _Then_ needful! thinking pandemic almost over. ridiculous. Wear masks, people, want lockdown 2025 whenever experts decide longer pandemic mode. Drones also drop 12-pack PBR next quickly forget vaccinated. read comment wanted say please don’t apologize “weakness.” weak. You’re trying get better best. Never let anyone convince weakness. wish &amp; girlfriend best.  Hey man, want say hope able find way back felt pre-pandemic, journey filled less rough spots future. wanted make general comment sentence wrote, wanted say first. social anxiety, low hum background became full agoraphobia. 

Oh boy feel sentiment hard. know pre-pandemic. think got point *full* agoraphobic, *super* close. like 3-4 month stretch *have* leave, didn't. *great*.

It felt like work social anxiety last decade+ came unglued, like peeling wallpaper maintain fix. there's ever silver lining found *personally* right circumstances, seed waiting grow let it. I'm glad know now, really glad learn it. least aware helps, think? work whole wallpaper thing. Get fucked. mask isnt coming back Florida population 21 million, cases 2 million. 

California population 39 million. Cases 3 million. 

While California number one state covid cases, California way people cases Florida. makes sense  unfortunate. People shit Alberta moving ahead quickly reopening also going 40% eligible people shots Canada Day insignificant. time stampede ends we'll 60-65%+ doses anyways.

I imagine BC's vaccine rate starts fall they'll shorten interval 8 weeks keep things moving along.  would wise get (multiple) formal studies effectiveness simple visual aids proof

the failure adapt communication styles frustrating. 18 months sure could produced work sad truth.
