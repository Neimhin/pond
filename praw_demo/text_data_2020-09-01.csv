0,2020-09-01," came bilateral pulmonary edema internal hemorrhaging. covid. need find real reason caused cop blaming Covid. many tests conducted days ago? impossible interpret statement without knowing much increase cases confounded increase testing. plenty leader.said 1 billion made personally alone. time elections.
Wonder ever get real brands n95 masks back stores home use garages, aka certain tasks require them. Good idea everyone can't go homeless owners mortgages renting out? Somewhere grim ""Roll Tide"" joke. remember remember vote November say true, extinction event? Christ quality sub thoroughly gone shit deniers starting sound less awful. There's going flu year (except tiny numbers) social distancing prevents much contagious Covid-19 spreading totally obliterate flu. didn‚Äôt enjoy lockdowns either talking dude Check / ask question /r/covid19positive already. Sorry hear symptoms. Good luck recovery. Ignoring 600+% increase, course. ask relevant question? wearing mask? *Cackles hysterically*  can‚Äôt even comprehend going southern states.

I ‚Äúfriend‚Äù posting facebook photos kids participating little league sporting event, lots kids families shown. live outside Phoenix. don‚Äôt know well enough call out, fuck.

I know Maine less population density, Arizona DEATHS total CASES everything still pretty much shut here. sure shit ain‚Äôt little league sports going here, universities acting like might close least expel students throwing party resulted like 3 cases. 803 jesus. free, like jannies mods ;)

Would people actually prefer Trump's handling virus Xi's? I‚Äôm trollin ya pal.  plan early adopter?  200,000 deaths normal year already... Heck, Trump could probably die Covid they‚Äôd still vote would far better US gave everyone ongoing disaster relief people could continue pay rent/utilities/grocery bills. one would come homeless massive amounts debt. temporary halt evictions pushes problem massive homelessness forward.  one seems care either. I'm teacher well teachers seem give shit all. effect them. want things get back ""normal"".

So messed up. Going back normal fast prolong it. doubts effectiveness poorly fitting face masks, novel observation, strongly recommends use face masks. Wait. die thrush? Oh wow. corporate children definitely going set wholly-owned subsidiaries offload college debt to. they're done school, subsidiaries declare bankruptcy wipe debt clean! God bless America! How, exactly, misleading? like personal attacks start people run arguments. Guess hard defend Denmark nowadays. Measles infection leads lifetime immunity. SARS2. If, believe world controlled cabal satanic worshiping, pedophile, cannibals, stupid enough pretty much believe anything. Sweden one highest death rates world. Look countries locked back normal spout nonsense. Well it‚Äôs 3 days far I‚Äôve impressed ccisd rolled remote learning. 2nd &amp; 4th examples. seeing got much worse past month.


Cases Denmark last month one lowest they‚Äôve been, July lower, April May combined cases per day much higher ...and rising. Oooooof that's particularly egregious, even standards news media.  matter statistics. old person died Corona March able die whatever September. happen known latest arrival data Italy. would sequela, woulda thought full lockdown would help stop virus? Regarding ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù... family lived house moved 6 hours away work. busted asses buy it, didn‚Äôt want sell major loss recession found tenant, rented market, never raised rent. busted asses even cover new housing costs plus shortfall rent vs. mortgage. 

I get people can‚Äôt pay rent, would evicted nice couple years ago remotely hard asses time even missing month, didn‚Äôt.

Me renting money asset really different renting home, hook part certainly not.

If forecloses bank takes ownership positively assure evict tenant earliest possible moment. bank profit, lose ass, tenant house.

This solution.   Remember six million problem States. see damned valved masks everywhere. People precious comfortable. wondering insight could get payed CCP post comments. could use money anything sort. Yeah there's lot things ""need"" country think Chinese ""surveillance"" cyberpunk, come China experience it? Wow bet symptoms like family/classmates, we're 1 step closer herd immunity. get fucking lives already? Here's hoping Denmark manages improve, seeing got much worse past month. good news one America would that. /s Same, memaw father law. I‚Äôm horribly sorry anyone go this. question isn‚Äôt whether viruses cause myocarditis. know do. 

The problem rate heart damage appears occurring. Nearly 70% resolved cases, symptomatic asymptomatic, showed signs heart damage [one German nothing fuck with. need studies know long term effects be, right early studies reason pause. Lmfao what? Regardless, praise Taiwan üáπüáº well handled whole pandemic. definitely handled much better USA China Remindme! 28 days! wouldn‚Äôt necessarily characterize mistake (to eliminate [NSC directorate global health security bio-defense]).

-Anthony Fauci who's director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases National Institute Health SINCE 198-fucking-4.

Preventing pandemics never president's job. Fauci's job thirty-six years. They're also hanging everything less deaths per capita.

Now we're 6 months MATH+ protocol we're going saving lot people would vented died back March/April.

But really going people long-lasting scarring lungs along kinds issues.

""If die everything perfectly fine"" also live SD makes fuckin angry. still remember literally suggesting remain calm visit family friends. Hahaha Haven‚Äôt gotten vaccinated flu years rarely ever get sick. Likely won‚Äôt corona, either. Can‚Äôt trust anything that‚Äôs injected body, especially something rushed unproven Covid vaccine. pretty thick, man. live town League City tested 3 times 3 different places like 2 months ago back covid month, tests results 2-4 days. It‚Äôs illegal? cite law?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* misunderstanding vaccines protecting person vaccinated protecting everyone person vaccinated could directly indirectly spread to.

Vaccinating children early makes total sense get past misunderstanding. countries world end March. Southern hemisphere countries significant hit began cool.

The southern states also basically gave restrictions got hit. They've hit hard, like northern states got hit way quickly far severe restrictions. 

Seasonality mean spread summer. spread indoors 21C it'll spread year. stop far severe winter.

All common cold coronavirus similar seasonal patterns, doubt would different. January August last year, United States Department Health Human Services initiated organized scenario based earliest appearance virus China, code-named ""Red Contagion"". October last year, multiple agencies United States jointly conducted global pandemic exercise called ""Event 201,"" modeled rapid spread coronavirus deadly SARS could lead global pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

This raises two questions.

1: U.S. respond poorly even exercise?

2: really coincidence infectious disease drills held United States last year actually happening real life year? Looks people accidentally 7 kids. sort see 1 accidental pregnancy. anything bonkers. People know better.  No. Statistics guessing. Excessive death means people died. got sick COVID died. simple. gotten sick, died yet. search ""life lost due COVID"" similar find preliminary study. One Italy estimated people died lost ten years life. (e.g., So, now, think anything final, guessing. years many lost real. You‚Äôre flabbergastedly stupid. tells fucked, already knew that.

You wastewater testing LOW levels community transmission order detect issues ahead time start randomized testing community education people even start turning sick positive.

We know we've got high levels pick hundred communities around country relatively control. need wastewater testing. need people stop idiots. think death side effect virus? believe lifelong lung damage concerning? Neurological problems? Heart problems?

At point, know extent damage done body virus every time think know something, changes...so feel like saying ""but die!!"" little shortsighted. wish proof this... doesn‚Äôt seem like that, least California. Here, POC poorer folks getting hit worse. No. really. See three weeks 21 cases I'm going engage bad faith stupidity. Post something meaningful fact-based write. Butttt.... children spreading covid members society haven‚Äôt done anything wrong... saying maybe shouldn‚Äôt top list think I‚Äôm point I‚Äôm horrified people around me, empathy bubble want get away fucking Karens. course I‚Äôm Orange County, CA, so... Yah saw it. Umm...what? protests going right civil rights, end COVID. Plus, believe majority conservatives made protests governors mask restrictions couple months back. 

Hell, I'm even liberal, could tell that. shit not, went school grew League City. thought school old went 24 years ago, must decrepit üòî. it‚Äôs meme slogan, call it, doesn‚Äôt make false.  logic Russia vaccine month? Everything risk/reward. Fast tracking early releasing vaccine works praised saving thousands lives many thousands hospitalizations. personally believe risk high vaccine production. None vaccines tested West use attenuated live virus methods dramatically increased risk early days. think rather death, present state science, far greater risk allergic reactions. Essentially I'm saying chances catastrophic failure much slimmer before, mean failure harder achieve. 

There effort manage expectations biotech community, pointing unlikely early vaccine best one available year more. point effort seems rescue world economic ruin, worry perfecting vaccine months years first one distributed. global population tolerate shaky start return normalcy mission critical every way. 

The success producing effective vaccine less year could overshadow first moon mission human achievement. least, recorded history times remarkable achievement along side completion human genome project. take last financial crises benchmark. 500 000 additional deaths caused cancer came years people go treatment.

England reported time ago already two additional deaths causes Corona victim. people never China, think Chinese know nothing, claim ""help"" Chinese banner ""freedom speech"".

These people want believe words foreigners there, prefer believe ""mainstream media"".

In fact Chinese know exactly foreigners want do, look pity Right. Covid19, people would gotten sepsis, pneumonia, stroke... died. plan rest life? Fucking stupid people. many scripts fill

-as long they're ones require extra paperwork corporate deal DEA. 

My local CVS pharmacist ""come Jesus"" moment fill script new mother carrying newborn carseat crumpled pain c-section, corporate put storewide monthly limit medication needed reached limit earlier day.  

He quit, bought little mom pop pharmacy across street much happier. Friend, dont engage. doesn‚Äôt matter much information context throw them. don‚Äôt understand landlord isn‚Äôt passive income passive investment. It‚Äôs work smaller ones like yourself.  

I don‚Äôt want hope ‚Äúfuck landlord‚Äù mind live tarp, I‚Äôm sure hell else informing shallow shortsighted sentiments maybe aren‚Äôt im sick tired people praising lockdowns benefited greatly middle class became delivery slave make rent See previous comments. 

Yes, see previous comments. absolutely *no clue* modern China working, you?

Go educated yourself, maybe start understand spilling brainwashed nationalist propaganda stand past on-going atrocities US.

It's even funnier see US constantly lying warmonger across world. US sick country, sick people, honestly losing empathy left towards American discussing online guys.

Honestly? society deserves what's on-going right now, decades policies profit ultra-rich put pit. go enjoy it. China part world recovering effort watching us. laugh pity. They're exact problem smaller scale Well played Russia. utterly subverted. Well fucking played. you‚Äôd even mild pneumonia (atypical) experienced long takes get better - might change mind article even talking ""experiment vaccines"" - final complete version they're saying prioritise Africa gotta get rid ""snitching"" culture bullshit among age demographic. creates lack witnesses accountability. exaggeration, article irresponsible. Check thread article COVID19 sub. seize profits assets use help protect preserve civilization dangerous virus?

Nah kidding happen. Banks lobbyists Washington, working class high risk dying get virus feel comfortable taking it. vaccine risk needs significantly lower disease risk. 80 year old diabetic that‚Äôs pretty low bar.

The difficulty comes asking whether vaccinate healthy low risk individuals almost zero risk disease, young children. I've seen people TV wearing completely transparent face masks. not. Even broke law, fucking handcuffs? Write ticket. Order delete it. Jesus. I'll honest know almost nothing guy I've passingly read Covid-19 policies...and can't help say opinion fear-mongering virus led country fair bit ruin.

He good example scientists put charge public policy. tend paranoid ""All-or-Nothing"" thinkers...and fucking fly dealing vast population. Americans cannot afford home. Hell Gen Z Millenials massive problem semi homelessness coach surf cause can't afford rent without solid group overworked adults. put blunt terms evictions effect far mortgages do. 

What done Heroes Act stopped evictions, halted mortgage payments covered utilities that's smothered get vote November, we're lucky. Goddamn, know Denmark *that* close back peak number! Talk regression, guess that's controlled burn does. want ‚Äúmilf.‚Äù Honestly amazed given population density. feels extreme. I‚Äôm Australian, I‚Äôm much favor lockdowns we‚Äôre handcuffs necessary?  Couldn‚Äôt ordered take down?

My wife 8.5 months pregnant know I‚Äôd going bananas.  federal state funding tied attendance. thing probably already thousands lawsuits works. feel like 6 months minimim amount time lawsuit could take. Also dont get notification letter mail someone sues employer. Nice try Al Jazeera, nobody cares negative effects ways choosing slow spread virus.

Least people different countries. People feel like west effect people countries Yep. Can‚Äôt believe people didn‚Äôt see coming. r/byebyejob state shitty laws require 'synchronous' time students class.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, laws caught online learning look like. give reason why? want know opinion.  n100 mask open valve, n95 screened valve.  wonder type tested. I‚Äôm Canada teacher, told ‚Äú10% acceptable losses‚Äù. feel you. school starts 2 days already know group teens ‚Äúsocially distanced‚Äù party weekend one got positive COVID test day after. Guess many kids party school first day...it ain‚Äôt 0. üò° People can‚Äôt trusted right thing selfish wants. Duh ÎÑ§, ÎßàÏûêÏöî started learning understand K-pop songs overtime fallen love language overall So, I'm necessarily this, CDC authority? yikes. seems like lot countries EU upswinging.

sigh. Ok well clear rather right mean median distinctionnthen actually listen others telling OK, happens banks? Denmark's cases seen huge increase one's cherry-picking dates.

Guess hard defend Denmark without saying ""but Country X currently worse measure, 600+% growth perfectly fine, guys"". lost job two months ago, FYI. I‚Äôm still favor COVID related safety precautions I‚Äôm selfish moron. blame shockingly, inexcusably bad ***for decades*** elementary-secondary public education US. 

We need shift military weapons-building Wall-building money ***massively*** improving public education never, *ever* happen again. 

We can‚Äôt prevent pandemics. prevent devastatingly-bad response ever happening improving education: teaching critical thinking, civics, government, science, science history, public health, etc., beginning K going 12. 

The US world-class public education, public health care, guaranteed basic standard living. fail counts inexcuseable üò£ landlord needs money, sell property. bad Left waiting toddler die Covid? Y‚Äôall really pushing blame Trump this. Y‚Äôall sick real problem America. Everything forever. It‚Äôs American way. people zero ability delay gratification. throat swaps done Thailand, nose swaps. consequences ability detect virus? WTF? expect East Stroudsburg, PA list. driving NYC? Really hate word, snitching. people nothing would happen. implemented socialist policy. supporters suddenly like it? ECDC basicaly agree evidence strong. case social distancing staying home sick seen lot important. Combining fact spread steady decline since early April means would pretty irresponsible change anything fundamental.

The public health agency clear messaging since start pandemic: Stay home sick, Wash hands often, Avoid crowded places (this includes public transport), elderly avoid close contacts. changed exception also recommending avoid traveling 2h home June. think feel adding something using face masks would undermine these, since would basically make OK follow important recommendations. aren't; surgical masks proper seal, there's inevitably going quite abit respiratory droplets. that's tightly fitted, people wearing way.

N95's valves much better it, extremely hard come by, also expensive, meant public use. someone studying Korean right now, thank ...that's good news, that's horrible. Travel something people enjoy helps advance lives. want travel. Exactly. 3 phased testing reason. It‚Äôs gold standard, anything less assumed safe, matter much think know. Things happen Phase 3 exclude medications safe quite often. way predict actually testing would say wish billboards America remembered many people smoke drive drunk spite warnings, plus people would probably vandalize shit. point is,

I‚Äôm supposed sacrifice job, social life health someone else. would me? It‚Äôs pretty obvious lockdown-advocates care loses jobs, roof heads, ability put food table.. see things calm given absolutely corrupted courts right now, counting backlogged are. China, whose government covered consequences citizens' addiction eating diseased bats, made enemy every nation Earth. That's say nothing treatment Uighurs, domination Taiwan Hong Kong, support North Korea, aggression India neighboring countries nearby seas. lives livelihoods _every nation Earth_ devastated irrational bad neighbor. honestly probably find feeling sorry wrath remaining 6.4 billion people planet brought them. world enemy number 1 foreseeable future.

Sorry, disease still present nearly every country earth (most locked entire economies well) known asymptomatic travel magically disappear populous nation planet. likely, happened CCP, known lying, lying authoritarian methods conveniently working? party known pushing authoritarian methods government propagandizing try make look good? likely -- sun rise tomorrow like come know do, magically shoot space? High death rates? Sweden number eight internationally topped nations like UK. USA soon overtaking. loudest critics always forget Sweden zero collateral damage. Unless whole lot people going willing take massive lifestyle downgrade (unlikely), person schooling still going thing. mean get extra funding. worry happen winter. Lower herd immunity, less disease exposure covid hits it‚Äôll hit hard. 

Nobody knows right solution is. We‚Äôve never locked whole countries never mind world like Got straight A's. called Ace No.

More lives saved reduced exposure pathogens, car accidents, workplace accidents, etc. 

If anything, number higher 200,000. could that.. could also people react news surges roughly way regardless restrictions imposed government, limiting travel going forth. hypothesis easy test. Society going tolerate late 2021 rollout. Look Mitch treated died related causes helping 9/11. Look veterans treated. history taught us anything, Republicans love bring children world, kill slowly time take away safety nets. dying person profitable dead one. Fine. send home stop pretending safely? 200,000 Even taking worst case scenario I‚Äôve read, contagious 3 days after.

But even then, surface contamination weird one, think risk severely exaggerated. H cave cave sustainable relief. whole reason bag shit prez signed executive order effectively nothing cause McConnell can't get enough people pass bill saying employers responsible covid. That's one benefit whole thing even worst circumstances, long people H bend it'll untenable position McConnell. 

And again, pretended hate common man *5 seconds* would stand decent chance maintaining power, physically can't help working hurt many people possible. evil bugs less incompetence point. Yes that‚Äôs called location services control that‚Äôs allowed accessed. Try boss. You‚Äôre old man Karen conspiracy theorist. Grab Metamucil have! many count. 

The issue I‚Äôm sure people could use help. think everything get masks public. 

If school requires masks also purchased large quantity surgical masks give kids show without one. think money came from?  McDonalds food probably killed people covid White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Scott Atlas responded report Monday claimed proponent ""herd immunity"" strategy combat Covid-19. ""I've never advocated strategy,"" Atlas said press conference Florida.

Such approach -- similar pursued Sweden -- would mean many people nationwide would get sick coronavirus order build natural immunity across communities. virus spreads sickens people, many could die process.  fact think it, reason cannot trusted.

Surveillance testing must. people agree happening video? looks insane like said Im living dont full context. morons would wear mask stop freaking ignorant would need ""snitch"" first place. 

People keep insisting ways that's going work. rest planet still fighting are. 

So nobody right. Take Peru France Greece example. Straw-man? 1,000 people dying every single day country. certainly aren‚Äôt straw men. cases deaths states attitudes like prevalent restrictions minimal. 

Also, let‚Äôs pretend like death negative consequence COVID. recover often lasting health problems - experiencing symptoms months months. absolutely idea long term impacts virus. It‚Äôs nightmare people get it, even survive. 

You arguing somehow live isolated social circle chance transmission vulnerable populations somehow everyone asymptomatic case. I'm sure actually read article study cited.

The valved mask effect wearing cloth mask, vast majority people wearing.

Two, N95 masks meant general public improper fit along improper usage means better cloth mask filtering particulates first place; KN95s. also issues people can't breathe, deal EAPRS. Wow seem know well; that‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever commented prior this. 

Though it‚Äôs quite leap make there. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt conduct vaccine trials Africans‚Äù apparently equivalent ‚Äúdrop contact Africa‚Äù. Clickbait: Declining antibodies mean declining immunity. honestly want laugh this. work profit hospital. One largest state. give flying fuck us workers. say do, actions support that. Management also come hard enough people working COVID floors can't practice basic mask wearing. Literally 3 days ago elevator 1 patient 3 nurses. One nurse gets phone call, immediately pulls mask yaps away. 

All care getting enough staff get elective surgeries done. say pay workers, can't let profits fall much else higher mean them. 

Think way. Testing expense. people sick means profits hospital, public officials purchased ultrarich society, incentive shut things again. top political turmoil currently going on. hospital incentive spend money workers terms test, results would likely get leaked media, nobody would come elective surgeries realize large portion staff asymptomatic. 

It's sight, mind problem. solution healthcare reform. seem like going happen meaningful way time soon. Sure, work 8 hours day maintaining investment... I‚Äôm not. strict restrictions Victoria, Australia currently person gatherings illegal, would organising crime. restrictions place til 13 September. mom would send us DayQuil, hour 3 1/2 4, you‚Äôd pop bad boy push symptoms back down. Speaks volumes counter-arguments met insults. would happy vaccine. seems far better alternative (covid 19). Simply sell investment, use money pay debt.  It‚Äôs responsibility take measures avoid injury, like workplace. you‚Äôre wearing proper filtered face mask, keeping distance sanitising could infected besides rare anomaly. 

I‚Äôm cater every aspect life suit every single individual. cater majority. reverse. Hell no, tested properly. ""children spread much"" research? new research contradicting that? Vietnam New Zealand got 100 days local cases popped again. interesting see happens next Thailand. Hopefully there‚Äôll slipups here. Talking shit. people pay kids? buy masks, hard. Assail him, impale him, [COVID-like] force one many mutations Corona virus, studies suggested populations already immunity 60%. real surprise achieved New York Sweden, surprise also achieved California Israel. Yeah there‚Äôs protests riots tens thousands people imagine COVID cases them. Yet media reporting Reddit downvotes silences people talk it. Great comment; deaths per million population important metric. LOL, think I'm outlier? think CVS going okay throwing inventory touched ground?

It would untrue say know works. hate break American Journal Medicine ""fake site"". 

OP cherry picked words make article sound like saying something clicks karma points. TuffinMop good job pointing article mainly warning side effects lack large scale research. Hydroxychloroquine drug used decades autoimmune disorders like Lupus rheumatoid arthritis. 

Here's commentary article American Journal Medicine site explains bit better issues prescribing hydroxychloroquine. That's beautiful way looking sincere thanks someone may never store trying protect colleagues majority customers good. Retail challenging enough without pandemic!

I moderate subreddit dead never alive. entirety moderation actions removing spam links sub. again, presumption wrong. questions suspect I'm power-obsessed moderator, much likely find right answer asking. need presume Nobody cares think here. 

I could say you, seeing we're members subreddit, won't, necessarily true. might couple people find value say, maybe not. presume know something can't possibly Flame want. 

I'm interested that. simply wanted point assumption flawed, far easy vilify someone share opinion view caricature basis reality ""we disagree."" incorrect assumption I'm power-hungry Mod reinforces point. use condom, sheepskin varieties allowed  Well yeah, risk exposure swallow pill wash hands really low. higher eating take groceries really. Could others said let sit days though. makes sense since claimed protesters rioters big deal. would rally different? Yeah, they're rushing vaccines too. first post linked exact mask. question first place. I've trying find data, appears majority aerosols 600nm 5 um range, filtering improves considerably. Youre reading myopically. See below:

He thinks voluntary distancing (aka lower mobility) primary driver early interventions.

""This understanding new. lockdown New York March 22 never primary cause behind flattening curve.

It voluntarily human behavior began two weeks prior (see graph). lockdown cautious burnout threshold 10-20% necessarily thing HIT, agree with.

Seemingly think cap change point specifically says there's ""hard cap""? I'm seeing thread.

""Addenum #1: clarify lower effective herd immunity threshold due *current interventions &amp; social distancing place*. interventions relaxed, would go back higher others misreading data something not. So, mobility primary driver lower HIT, mobility stayed (it has), HIT artifically lower. magic cap speak 10-20% actually exist. increasing resistance coupled behavioral changes. fuck up. page 28-29. According Benford's law, China's covid numbers reliable Germany Switzerland, reliable European countries. Meanwhile, US numbers unreliable. 

Yeah believe numbers Agenda LMAO. course subreddit state is, people like one mod. ""essential"" part upset/outraged about, obviously. fact ""essential"" workers (teachers) taken advantage completely discourse shut get out. want force better working conditions taking away resources (ie striking) get fired fucked rest life.

Doesn't seem fair, it? Tape KT tape? teacher's union stop this? whole point unions, put end terrible working conditions. can't anything this, useless. studies regarding pediatric asymptomatic cases? licensed? jeez. reason we're 6 months told SD mask 2-3 weeks COVID would go away.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* edited title short summary study. comprehend trying discount article facts nothing article stating. That's one component it. think lot reasons once.

- Doctors getting better treating virus
- Many people taking precautions like social distancing mask wearing, even get infected lower viral load leads lesser infection
- Many nursing homes hit hard first wave. think around 40% US deaths nursing homes states even higher that. new outbreaks nursing, lower amount dead too.

So me, seems like couple different factors coming together explain lower death rate aren‚Äôt going give shit acne scars catch virus, it‚Äôs valid reason. lot people mild cases permanent heart damage, it‚Äôs worth scarring permanently disabled virus extremely contagious. projection strong them. call us sheep listening scientists world coming independent consistent conclusions listen one guy proven everyday life care one himself... bet believe Q Anon. Exactly wear properly fitting n95 p100, less likely sick first place compared someone wearing surgical masks. yes filtering exhaust n95/p100 filter wearer likely sick first place. surgical masks kinds leaks definitely filtering n95 p100 media. attack properly fitting n95 p100 masks claim worse surgical masks correct. Cool cool. lot words say mask hole it. 

Wanted clear. we're getting somewhere

we (should) fight infectious diseases measures reasonable relation impact society whole. measures worse disease itself.

This probably went merry Danish life thousands people died last year flu, year that.

They also preventable deaths. comes level harm willing make peoples lives. maybe scared death, thinking prevented costs. safe play pick-up basketball? understand playing outdoors severely reduces risk getting virus, especially lot close contact wearing masks, think still safe go play?  That's completely correct. also, that's exactly said. arguing? NSAIDS upregulate ACE2 receptor virus uses invade cells theory could make easier virus fuck shit Alabama ranks worst state work ~~during COVID-19 crisis~~: study heros.... tell people stupid wearing masks. honestly think hospitals facing PPE shortages.

I work large hospital system analytics determine days hand projections. constant concern.

So kind like beginning said ""Masks work"" knew people would hoard buy already scarce. students. school told us long students wearing PPE (cloth masks) separated 6 feet without masks considered close contact anyone diagnosed. Riots...lol. Oh please elaborate. Dude stop. really grasping straws here. want present scientific argument, fine. want argue hypothetical ani-vaxxer strawman, wasting time. diseases (especially respiratory ones), appear cross immunity. vaccines seem temporarily boost immunity unrelated diseases. opposite also true, vaccine may stimulate antibody production particular pathogen, reduce body's response pathogens. None effects even remotely controversial, unless learned science CNN refuse read anything even remotely nuanced. kind anti-scientific behavior honestly worse anti-vaxxer study linked information whatsoever coronaviruses

It addresses respiratory used symptom shown household member reason collect nasal throat swabs test respiratory illnesses.

OMG look you. guess disproves everything! Except incredibly flawed study. small sample size methods used make data completely irrelevant.

No isn't. valid study limited sample set. specifically state sample size is, methods used come conclusion. statistician might point enough samples study generalize wider population, would valid point. grasping straws dismiss idea makes Trying tie anything involving Covid-19 completely unscientific

I already addressed multiple times. arguments ""ha! gocha! wrong!"" think, rehashing completely irrelevant strawman bs. Korean KS94s ear loops like better. they‚Äôre tested get rating respective countries they‚Äôre roughly equivalent. election. convenient. Covid initiate petitions?

No argument there. think they're stupid ban N95 first place, believe they're correct saying people change filters anyway. school work like ""hey guys, made masks use!""

It's useless. way thin. Hell, hold mask front computer screen, see though it.

In healthcare environment, relaxing fit test requirements, necessity. Trying get approved respirators various sizes nearly impossible. n95 supply chain inconsistent markup prices still crazy. tried different types masks exfoliating night? Maybe would go way trying exempt yourself.

Worst comes worst scarring, wearing masks shown greatly reduce severity catch it. good trade opinion considering there‚Äôs potential permanent long-term neurological/heart damage associated it. Worse permanent external scars. Come think it, stat irrelevant lumps every thing together.

Like deaths forest industry decreased lot 2020 whatever reason, would push 2020 down, go ""of covid bad!"" 

Because mix together deaths forest industry death covid, course can't interested people dying covid work accidents foreste. Welp better stop trials then, u/desenagrator_3 knows better experts  According every database besides Orange County‚Äôs, guys least 60% infection per capita threshold removed watchlist. According articles written it, seems OC officials using different set date conventions reporting new infections relative rest state. OC purposefully using self-reported symptom start dates determine infection start effort game watchlist whereas rest state reporting infection dates results obtained clinical testing. Basically, OC backdating positive results would less effect metric keeps counties watchlist, infections per 100k last 14 days. Piles dead street, burning buildings, zombies roaming. Basicly normal Ume√•. known anyone actually tested positive?

Yes. physically fit officer US military laid flat almost month. Almost killed spouse infected teenage sons, one already lung problems.

It joke.  Agreed That's exactly stated. I'm protecting many people around wear mask all. They're worried anyone else. sure show respect that.

True, also hospitalizations well far Well he's currently 3-year $96 million deal. he's already earned $100 million career. do't think that's issue. doubt it. Ssssooooo many people see hear N95 assume that's thing need, without research actually use/maintain it. Yeah Kirk, naive fool, grandma dies minor case?

That‚Äôs anti-mask/anti-social distance crowd ignores everyone‚Äôs peril. one‚Äôs individual risk only. everyone breath contact potentially made. really looking like hey? question is, teachers begin pass away COVID-19, school district going pick funerary expenses or...? Dr Fauci NATIONAL TREASURE want hoard supplies healthcare workers damn sure getting them. Im education require kids wear masks teachers matter. one first open going hybrid kids staff getting sick. made bunch empty promises surprised sick. Whats scary sick kids parents refuse get tested schools shut down. sick count extremely reported. Shit, whats fleece masks? mean it‚Äôs much better ask company donate bit? employees skimming PPE I‚Äôd disappointed, ask create ration employees. 

Politicians govt nothing scenario? likely, depend largely whether take right precautions. see people wearing incorrectly correctly. people frustrated mask usage likely people think football good idea moment. Id guess they're almost exclusive groups. Tots pears Lol... live Cal buddy got back Cancun yesterday. Probably go myself, sayin. Yeah Oxford vaccine Fauci ok I'm ok it. seen indications yet Fauci would wrong thing political purposes. joke gets better better every see every single sturgis thread since rally began 4 weeks ago comment admitted stealing/embezzling product job... Omg, that‚Äôs terrible you. condolences. fair....hospital staff working regular masks, N95 COVID pts. There‚Äôs reason teachers wearing N95 time. Leeches suck. already rails bring concept ""principles"" someone reasons purely expediency. Amorality principles mix. course, correct--as early utilitarians rapidly discovered, expanded primitive logic accommodate truth-telling foundations human relationships. sure hope so. Biden elected need form independent panel investigate Trump Campaigns criminal mischief. needs disconnect completely likely need well respected Republican it‚Äôs leader, one isn‚Äôt compromised. Simply letting crimes go empower future Trumps worse.

Any Republican reading thinks I‚Äôm somehow amplifying fake news:

Kushner literally bought, sold stole PPE states make profit jacking prices hoarding front line medical workers. several people already willing go oath state claims. intentionally misled public COVIDs spread ignored problem areas because, ‚Äúthese weren‚Äôt people‚Äù meaning let Democratic cities people - Americans die. Imagine Obama done this. crimes low, Cold War era would gotten dragged back shot head. Trump crew complicit this.

I hope whenever Democrats take back control charge people full extent law. personally hope spend decades prison allowing shit happen anyone else stood idly also charged knowingly contributing lawlessness. Thats true. Thanks explaining me. affects poor (and therefore minorites) wealthy white people. many sad individuals brainwashed whole lives blame poor poor see less resources disabilities non contributors society, see nothing wrong situation.

Respect+ assumption definition optimistic. Using numbers, optimistic fatality rate would 0.5%, means *even if* every American infected, 0.5% would die, cuts ‚Äúmost optimistic estimate‚Äù half.

Add optimistic studies like suddenly looks like covid might infect maybe third fifth population we‚Äôre optimistic. really multiply optimistic fatality rate 0.5% optimistic herd immunity threshold 20-30% reduce ‚Äúmost optimistic estimate‚Äù factor almost five.

Can admit you‚Äôre taking intentionally weighted, scary numbers, trying pass ‚Äúbest case scenario‚Äù guess don‚Äôt get hilarity it? kind desperate ‚Äúholy shit hell wrong people‚Äù/‚Äúlaugh can‚Äôt cry anymore‚Äù laughter totally justified - hilarious.

The hysteria real. would one either way distract public general election otherwise they'd actually acknowledge bad Biden is. That's probably do. Killing unionized employees? maybe let live lives make decisions like adults. no! bring nanny state! bring military! guard lock dorms! reeeeeeeeeeeeeee US shrink 4x this? Sweden pretty similar changed model food stayed open. People food bars midnight ... lot drinks side.

[It's plate food passed around different tables, right? happened before, happen again. *might* give answers, might not. positive result would telling, negative one really really tell anything useful all. antibody test given first month so, false negative rate fairly high ridiculously so. point, far less likely get positive result negative one even COVID. Five months out, virtually guaranteed get negative antibody test result. moral abortion abortion.  N95 may actually worse. lot N95 vented entire point filter 95% incoming, outgoing. 


So used improperly still pose risk infection user making N95 rating (and expense rarity that) pointless. worn period (properly improperly) little protect others exhalation going right vent uninhibited unfiltered. 


Society better surgical well made homemade mask going use N95 improperly. basically likely get infected using N95 improperly, less likely infect others block exhalation, wasting valuable resource. question whether aim herd immunity strategy, eventually get there.

This entire article based false premise herd immunity natural causes best course action. 

It ignores everyone viewing best path forward- mitigate virus best vaccine available. Using logic police armed use body armor drive $60k vehicles, wait. know doctor Brazil follows know gone normal denying virus kills many people (despite losing 3 close doctor friends it) wearing masks outside hospital setting sending messages vaccine wanting control people kill 80% population. like landfill worm choke Exactly. happy make sign talk social media anything create change... people really interested. Here‚Äôs analogy 94% pre-existing conditions figure-

Technically, predatory animals never kill prey. Blood loss, suffocation, organ damage prey animals die attacked predator.

But predator caused things happen, really predators kill prey. –ß—Ç–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å, —Ç–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å. exactly. want everyone beliefs even force it. get sick, well that‚Äôs fine. article like 3 paragraphs larger discussion. Honestly OP touch misleading title hope good Maybe evidence garbage. haven‚Äôt seen anything higher quality pointing particular direction.

But either way argue bad faith. may underlying conditions, one contributed Covid19 death willful ignorance.  Go figure. guy trench coat trying sell steroids actually right along.  Finland see guy smiling, know two things.

There incredible reluctance upper eschelons US govt actually make hard decision push everyone shut things month two make sure enough testing contact tracing hopefully able resume business mostly usual.

Instead became politicized disease since AIDS epidemic we've intermittent shutdowns almost year developed countries able open economies safely. Even height thing experts saying two months coordinated nationwide shutdown would enough contain things.

This considered, again, costly compared to
the protracted year long reign terror we've stuck try maintain economy. economy going shit things slow, businesses would've survived month long closure/quarantine regulations gone now, we're left completely senseless failed policy politicized ""the best could've done"".  UK pretty direct saying trying stop infection slow health service get overwhelmed, especially coming winter. Time tell got right. doubt it. look source clear pattern ranking states. speculation Cuomo initially putting COVID patients nursing homes reduce pension liability. 

It's probably stupidity though.

The family values party‚Ñ¢ adopted kitten born without heart valve lungs. developed 3 instead 4 doctors state university running tests said miracle still alive.

He died arms breathing got shallower wheezy. happened days became sick covid likely contracted me.

My cat breathing issues week so, fine now.

My 11 month old cat human would part 94%, yet still covid killed him. Common colds little annoyance.  There‚Äôs guarantee years research billions dollars recouped effort eradicate them.  Measles comes baby deaths, brain damage hearing loss. Polio comes deaths, permanent limb malformation, permanent hospitalisation breathing paralysis. Flu comes baby, elderly immune compromised deaths, mutates rather fast, achieve new vaccines every year cover likely epidemic strains. 

There‚Äôs lot demand vaccines dangerous illnesses.

Covid19 possibly going difficult too, unlike common colds, comes elderly obese deaths, many survivors permanent heart, lung and/or kidney damage, post viral syndrome worst form permanently disabling, confining patients house bed life.  also comes brain fog memory problems, often making study professional work impossible. know things post viral syndromes viruses especially cause cytokine storms. would universities students attend BLM event without wearing masks flouting social distancing rules? university dare suspend students? ‚ÄúIt is.‚Äù People made minds virus March/April lot psych research suggests people take position, presenting facts run counter position change mind, actually entrenches position. opens worms, considering atrocious lack infrastructure place. Almost like decades long campaign under-fund, privatize, dismantle public services, coming back bite us ass. Wild. Thank you, CumBlaster1200 scientist right. need able hear teacher clearly help education. Theres it. death rates gone completely vanished COVID deaths reported. actually additional 2.6 million. maybe additional 260,000. best. believe do. 3M vendors prioritize clients see fit. simply operate first-come, first-served basis.

[3M explicit public announcements. Hospitals would get supplies first, Home Depot Amazon would wait shortage resolved. 3M would sue anyone attempting profit functional democracy demands *a lot* less. article seemed link antimask article side too. site probably added badded sites list sub Kind of, way people going keep distancing/not socializing months months. Yea school pay millions dollars lawsuits forcing kids teachers suffer school hires administrators try unfuck getting sued first place.

Its amazing circle already five vaccines works extremely promising. best minds US working best funding. Oh see.

What meant moreso class action suits individual ""large"" corporations wherever happens policies defy guidelines put employees great risk.  think Amazon example skirting red line awhile, least initially. easy fix either. federal government already owns station- pbs. would create air programming school hours. Hope worth it. Leave inner city destitute. Dear present you

You extremely short sighted think worst going get.

You're going wish staying home biggest problem.

Onwards, climate crisis full blown fascism. joking least. know dies suffers covid (the risk factors). know prevent spread. time isolate risk population open economy. Remember hoping flatten curve hospitals would run. largely accomplished. isolate risk population reach herd immunity little problems. Yeah let get straight. expect drunk people responsible already show irresponsible sober? absolutely bonkers! finally data co2 emissions without cars driving. Everything point model. Closest I‚Äôve gotten pants jacket + shirt + tie + shorts Zoom presentations Yeah looking Peru. population 30 million posting 10,000 cases (this like 100,000 US).  Pretty awful, think matter time every country says fuck let's see vaccine does. one extended family, aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins...has gotten it. wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs pure luck really depends lifestyle social status is.  nurse I‚Äôm even fitted n95 didn‚Äôt enough fit us all. never worn one, regular surgical mask entire time.  media. necessarily fake, driven sensationalism times. twindemic sounds kind cool. america, half country would demand fire every teacher except one tv. We've simply never bothered bring one completion before, either worth effort ""common cold"" coronaviruses, serious coronaviruses we've dealt (SARS MERS) self limited died without intervention. 

The Oxford vaccine actually started years ago response SARS, basically shelved SARS offed us. Please quit talking know talking about-

""According CBS News, head Food Drug Administration says one could ready Election Day -- phase three clinical trials wrapped up. That‚Äôs raising serious concerns among medical Osha always treated like joke. like people treat irs law division post office.

They exist continue exist. never said anything bad...you filled dots assumed bad intent. must assuming terrible things mod.. keep people safe. didn‚Äôt even know mustang festival...and I‚Äôm feeling weird owning mustang knowing :/ He‚Äôs guy trust. Yes even care miners lol?

They nothing this.Whatever wrong covid. got sick, whatever. Lots peopl get sick. provide little detail? child NICU everyone required masked gloved times. even put cell clear, disposable bag provided.

EDIT: masked, naked... thanks autocorrect... January? March? Yeah, like stupidity careful, friend mine got banned saying something similar (because saying something like said ""political""). **slowly takes respirator...** that? proud awesome work done Victoria smash second wave! Every day check listen presser. Almost now, Brisbane Fake murdahs. back normal Christmas, right? wear n95 mask work. say allowed, give ""OK"", keep wearing doing. Leave ask leave, quit. anyone subreddit actually read article? one worst written articles I've ever read, like even know begin guess I'll start two things stood (besides fact 10 days old).

First author incredibly derogatory attitude toward countries referring Uganda Zimbabwe ""third world countries"", guess oblivious context term even means, well acting like critical failure countries exercise restrictions US like US regularly countries well within sovereign rights so.

Second, guess importantly, underlying argument makes absolutely sense. People travel reasons tourism; country open travel restrictions exactly neon sign attracting tourists major attractions remain closed. that, would lockdowns facilitate tourism countries handling COVID-19 best impose tightest restrictions tourist activity? Whoever wrote absolutely idea they're talking apparent capacity.

This literally worst written article I've ever seen get 20 upvotes time Reddit. like worthy Billy Madison ""what said one insanely idiotic things I've ever heard..."" speech. fact many upvotes like pretty clear indication Redditors actually read articles voting/commenting. surprised wearing mask least? actually suspect OSHA may partly blame it.

N95s count respirator, company required respiratory protection program fun goes along that, medical screenings employees, fit testing, training, record keeping.

I know everyone probably jump say required program since limit exposure, it‚Äôs kind like bell can‚Äôt un-rung. Corporations don‚Äôt want invite new regulatory burden. 

This speculation though, find odd employees wear cloth masks N95s, find N95s don‚Äôt fall need get adjusted since fit better. say denying death? Point 

I said ‚Äúany death tragedy‚Äù Fact matter shouldn‚Äôt around handling caused unnecessary deaths sounds right. people posting 200K? around 240K. pre-manufacturing 100 million doses Pfizer vaccine released second gets approval targeting 300 million doses EOY.

I believe Gates Foundation also pre-manufacturing hundred million doses one backing.

There pretty broad availability day one result. Shocking! hear people talk, think BLM protesters leading cause law enforcement deaths. Nice username it‚Äôs funny you‚Äôd idolize player. 

The enlightenment 300,000 tested would far 260 cases... derived 6,000 tests, probably increased alone waiting results. 
So I‚Äôm glad could spell second time. 
Thirds anyone? person replied actually banned mods comment, weirdly enough. Exactly yo. trump appointed 2nd ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù opposite views virus pretty much questions legitimacy covid it‚Äôs fake real. Shits laughable !remindme 9 weeks agree change well. ‚ÄúCDC guidelines‚Äù masks apparently changes every day. 

First wear em

Then wear em one could get ahold needed HCP.

Then said wear kinda, addendum infect people. 

Now telling people wear without giving alternative. 

Pretty sure told wear effective stopping getting sick, effective stopping getting someone else sick. Besides political reasons, would anyone ban people eating N95 masks? It'll cover 150M people. That's hell start can't completely disregard GOOD would be. could put us normal summer next year things back 'normal' (at point feel like normal relative). know companies plan would mass produce vaccine approved either. would think would come plan everyone wants vaccine able get it.

I'm trying get hope wherever point. America fought hard live market, society. hate fight it. I'm guessing reasoning N95 masks something can't really get right now, reusable average person. probably want avoid idiots see public reusing single use masks. frequent urination potential symptom covid? I‚Äôm area US low levels virus every time I‚Äôm around anyone outside household, I‚Äôm paranoid next days. don‚Äôt really symptoms notice I‚Äôve urinating frequently. urine clear color. 

I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs I‚Äôve drinking water, I‚Äôm sure know...paranoid lol Moooom, grandpa posting internet again. thought changed wifi password? wait shut down? Well? it? leave us hanging, man! also can't rule someone kept humans, pangolins bats trapped cave 30 years untill one humans escaped travelled Wuhan.

And could say viruses. Pig flu could come secret basement full humans pigs 

But there's reason believe either.

Humans happen naturally time. believe, reason, one not? This. It‚Äôs great tout numbers low now, state worst hit place world. policies. He‚Äôs lucky media side. sleep quality improved fewer noisy airplanes flying house.

Also commute gone 33% cause many people working home. freedumb!!! think article says 218 july 31st.  thats +40 50 world meter time. recognize people miserable still feel need add insult injury. Honk honk, keep clowning. mean Trump use proof open again. reasoning ‚Äúa vaccine Christmas. So, go normal lives then.‚Äù see now. IFR accurate. read emails Swedish. saying Sweden it. discussing different scenarios, supposed do. Even personally wanted to, think would able go it. make decisions alone. least california, hospital sanitizes masks rational argument. Death inevitability. want prolong, value, respect life change that. try deny death entirely abandoning science entering realm insanity. occur mentioned health, Sweden also universal healthcare, citizens waiting quite literally dying go hospital avoid bankruptcy. mobile search ""flair:Good News"" Mouth met smash Well, best part much talked lot Americans fighting self-immolation. local Kaiser administering phase 3 clinical vaccine trial (double blind, placebos too). awfully tempted volunteer participant. N95 masks valves, don't. like started using term ""Bomb Cyclone"" describe winter storms.  
BTW, flu shots available every CVS Walgreens. anyone worried go get shot now. Wish comments would get visibility, horrifically misleading headline. Hopefully enough people report misinformation least get headline changed site huge jump think could really been, would caused huge outbreak well covid would rarely kill miners covid, somethibg else doctor manage diagnose.

If actually read articles, never said miners COVID. said miners SARS-like pneumonia illnesses. U Mich started one Sept 1, AZA vax case didnt catch one.  Terrible don‚Äôt care drop dead, someone take job leave. useless distinction, made easy confuse ""only 10,000 people died Covid-19.""

if healthy person gets Covid-19, gets pneumonia Covid-19, dies said pneumonia people trying telling us person die Covid-19. absurd deserve criticism it. case unique, context set circumstances.

I agree this. I'm sure spectrum cases flagrant disregard safety rules case employer everything right, still bad luck someone getting sick. 

My point recommended class action suit people think got virus work joining single massive case really make sense. hand employees working one employer joining together could make sense. did. Trump's people like ratcheted smear campaign buried contradictions radiologist. Given personal inclinations (surly, old, misanthropic curmudgeon), much strain, frankly. wife son, we'll try kind workarounds. meantime, assembled whole series protocols minimize symptoms indeed contract virus. Oh knows freaks OK compare Sweden neighbors Norway Finland. people wonder it‚Äôs still spreading control. Positive message mean positive Sweden.

It difference ""don't like Sweden"" ""be like Denmark"" - one messages positive one negative. See spot it. Nope. Totally false.

If believe COVID-19 death totals, instead look many Americans dying *in general.* Raw death numbers can't faked; death death. COVID-19 deaths simply results doctors fudging numbers, total deaths would completely unaffected compared historical averages.

Except quickly see Americans usual clearly *are* dying. [In fact, there's strong indication COVID death totals total number people died US since beginning March right around 215,000 usual. data stops July 31st, date COVID death totals around 150k, means 215k number likely closer 250k now.

Sorry dude. fed propaganda that's easily disproved.

Also - I'm curious. motivation think behind ""fascist"" measures? think public health officials swinging dicks around fun? rolling side side floor speak. follow recommend keeping great username. 

Realtalk though: thank frontline retail worker. probably getting paid enough deal people's crap whatever they're paying definitely enough now. advice re: things us customers help (apart staying store possible following rules can't)? Trump muzzled CDC doubled idiotic personality that's do. He's impatient entitled anything else. Wait fucker still alive? Yeah probably. don‚Äôt know cultural differences us South Korea, think aren‚Äôt well prepared pandemic here. mean, many employers expect work sick, MAY give days sick (one example) taking money government reason seen shameful large portion population.

I think best case scenario US always slow hope treatments vaccine, think even regard horribly due failure national level consistent messaging/leading example.

Now, left worst both, likely millions dead end destroyed economy take years recover (best case scenario) fill dropped pills??.... Yes, guidance government CDC.

But people take masks home, office seats, meals, also less crowded situations (at least co-workers do)

On way dinner, time we're out, wear masks.

Claims mail voting us fraudulent voting mail think health workers get routinely screened virus. It‚Äôs literally setting turn on, dude.  Scary. quite ironic CVS sells medicines. actually *seen* structure spike protein? That‚Äôs protein wants go environmental transmissions.

This isn‚Äôt particularly structurally strong virus. rate, don‚Äôt get COVID-19 getting virus skin, get COVID-19 getting virus mucous membranes nose, oropharynx, (possibly ‚Äî I‚Äôm entirely convinced data yet, mostly convinced) eyes.

If you‚Äôre touching face you‚Äôre wearing mask indoors (like you‚Äôre supposed summer winter), surface transmission isn‚Äôt going big deal. aren‚Äôt following precautions, you‚Äôre still going likely introduce virus mucous membranes inhalation would getting negligible amount thermally-shocked virus finger, whatever doesn‚Äôt get wiped course daily life stay there, depositing even less onto membranes.

TLDR: Don‚Äôt touch face, becomes nonissue. Even insist touching face, it‚Äôs highly unlikely clinically significant. ban first? Explaining partial reopening still supports point moving goalpsts. Stop using terms know meaning of. getting globalism rich, poor locked giant prisons. LOL yeah ban tobacco, there's way smoke then

You know, like weed Hell yea Fuck asshole. dead people banned hydroxycloroquine zinc treatment worked Latin America. wanted get rich vaccine patent thousands died. tried crimes humanity Hague hanged.  Course good empathy even evil. 

No. Fuck evil people. give murderous bastards empathy trying prolong nightmare kill many people can. I? realize intensive exhausting emotionally available sympathetic people ‚Äúbubble?‚Äù Much less hundreds thousands outside affected. 

Im pretty tired seeing comments pretend sang kum baya around campfire everything would solve itself.  many horsemen to, point? Or...hear out, shitty medical coding...? That's dumb Unfortunately it‚Äôs probably higher that. That's flat ridiculous, old health issues... Surely double digit % would passed away without corona. Also many counted total never even tested positive virus.  There‚Äôs rapid test school insisted get. need find PCP, think COVID we‚Äôre expected quarantine work home 4 days, get tested, wait results avoid false negative. Meanwhile, getting cleared non-existent PCP cost 200 bucks despite good insurance.

Okay, good luck Condolences.

This happened. You‚Äôll get eventually. Let Dems let couple decades. point vaccines lower disease population Florida's increase due reporting backlog. ""The cumulative burden influenza estimate number people sick, seen healthcare provider, hospitalized, died result influenza since October 01, 2018. CDC know exact number people sick affected influenza influenza reportable disease areas United States. However, numbers estimated using mathematical model, based observed rates laboratory-confirmed""

There testing sites flu best guess, treated numbers would same.

A week ago ""covid deaths"" set stone week oh ""with covid"" whats going next week?

Now what? reads ""6% time, doctors go covid classifying death"". I'm sure could come codes nearly them, 94% time do.

The CDC never modified page highlighting irrelevant factoid, botnets+president never pushed top. are. mean, people dying average roughly 1000 per day America alone, people say people fat, old, asthma, host ""contributing factors"" somehow die COVID they... what? affected human condition? idiotic. 4 months...So could technically get infected 3 times year? Fuck Republicans, fuck president, rot hell literal eternity. feeling way change actual facts Trump's woefully bungled response pandemic, matter fact *caused* feelings.

The messenger change message, even hates guts. Bias change facts, often facts. Like poor FBI fools text messages weaponized. hated Trump *for good reason*.

TLDR wikipedia entry ad hominem Nope. them, clarification retraction ""confirm"" conspiracy. retarded? ^ This, unironically. Sounds like shitty rule thumb breaks easily. trump didnt wear mask July? thought 15 cases soon zero? Yeah! thought we're going become young well again! one health system. Others different criteria county health departments test anyone walks door.

Tennessee done pretty good job making tests available. need improve turnaround time bit. thought mean; turns median. know study referenced shows 57% died within first 6 months, suggests ~40% US coronavirus deaths nursing homes (thanks NY, IL, NJ, CA, MI!) *and* 57% die within 6 months, likely percentage people would died 2020. so? 

You look statistics both, did. disputing? sounds like absolute hell. barely saw Kurzgesagt video COVID infected, many problems worry compromises immune system point getting whole mess health issues. again, someone dies pneumonia contracted illnesses doesn‚Äôt mean would otherwise. COVID STILL CAUSE. straight making shit Curbs when? go back again?

In six months New Zealand still dealing US done it, you‚Äôre going look really dumb. You‚Äôre wrong. But, please consider school system itself. Consider kind society government needed cultivate school system like this.

Districts don‚Äôt get make decisions regarding attendance ‚Äî that‚Äôs mandate state. 

If people valued education, wouldn‚Äôt treating faculty, staff, students like workers factory, students graded product, given scores meat. mean Hell, ton schools without school nurses. 3 schools share one nurse. Including pandemic....


In state, kids school 10 days school year, state mandate. not, could held back, forced retake classes, stay longer hours weekends school make-up hours, go summer school. Nothing okay. advocate kid absent lot, going prison visit recently-incarcerated family members (which means moved around, dealing lot.) may anecdotal, it‚Äôs one instance highlighting flawed system. 

It absolutely maddening hear people freak defunding police ‚Äî education defunded years. see corona supplies we‚Äôre given....seriously...

It blows mind political issues. wish people cared much defunding education defunding police. Cops buying military-grade weaponry. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm given face mask one layer fabric sanitizing spray cleaning desks classes. Oh, they‚Äôll eating lunch classrooms. 

Please, care kids, care educators life, care people children go home to, vote change. 

And small change. need ideological shift country wherein education children matter. children mattered, they‚Äôd change things. Think things like agrarian calendar education shaped around. Come on; year round calendar better all, especially comes learning gaps summer inspire. explain class cap 32 colleges class caps 400? blue fuck ok? 

Ask country actively keeping populace ignorant unhealthy. 

Value education. Vote. Demand more.

Edit: try grammar. don‚Äôt always grammar good... surprise all, US government hopelessly dysfunctional.

If simple way stop rest world getting vaccine, would probably use it. Hey let tell guys secret.

You need speak CAPITALISM want message heard.

**Do say**:

Wearing mask protects people virus.

A lot people die continue downplaying virus.

**Say**:

Everyone wearing face masks could save America $1 trillion **GDP loss**

**Stock market plunge** US refuses join international effort develop Covid-19 vaccine due high chance failure. (Hey [America Running Low Crucial Resource COVID-19 find someone fluent CAPITALISM, send message across. Millions ‚Äúhuman capital stocks‚Äù saved! Wrong. half way project subdivide home two units. longer rush. invest money project right now? could lose shirt. What‚Äôs risk preventative measures novel virus becomes pandemic though? idea virus would affect population obese, unhealthy individuals multiple co-morbidities. know know time? complete isolation works, worked since beginning time, that‚Äôs forced argument. 

Just pointing out. first was. he's posturing.

The numbers show despite many us recently become infected, almost nobody dying. Everyone old feeble already died.

Fauci... people... knows this.

Now he's standing firm pretend effort save 0.00001% lives need work go lives appear 'hero'

I'm demonizing him, but, worst over. point on, bad normal 'flu' -- unless 80+ fat diabetes, etc. But... lives really important rest us?

Almost entire year lives careers taken... us! why? save 0.1% die anyway??? That‚Äôs... kinda point. didn‚Äôt happen South America.

Btw, country several US backed cues. Last ended around 30,000 people killed nightmare like cleanse. ‚ÄúSketchy things‚Äù won‚Äôt even begin cover it. different candidate gets approved sooner? Lmao.. onion title?  comes refrigerated trucks... Damn right get Sona Nanotech test approved ASAP....this test needs massssss produced available schools, University‚Äôs, Airports, Cruise ships etc.

This test‚Äôs ability accurately detect Covid asymptomatic people exactly need. table one thing, loitering bar. Normal, IL, seated order food drink. issues mentioned likely would big deal competent leadership regarding mess. 190,00 Americans would still alive weren‚Äôt dead suggestion wear masks.

190,000 Americans Would Still Alive Dr. Fauci I‚Äôm willing wait months vaccine, get word don‚Äôt work next candidates won‚Äôt review next spring summer, it‚Äôs time go back normal, isolate sick can, ride living.

I fear we‚Äôre looking glass though, certain governments people keep us locked years without vaccine, need be. CDC authority? Ever hear phenomenon called winter inversion? .0006 % population though ? Im saying terrible thing lose many people media portrays 20% USA died. legit lady family's store arguing 9% population died it. 320000000 people country. 160k people nothing. I'm terribly sorry lost loved ones literally minuscule number. lose half million smoking alone. 41000 people even smoke.  comment thread isn‚Äôt biggest echo chamber I‚Äôve encountered years Reddit, it‚Äôs damn close. read whole article wondering part app helps orphans would come up. lived one biggest fears, that‚Äôs scary shit. wish best progress life. weekly number deaths (from causes) ""A delayed game eventually good, rushed game forever bad."" democracynow.org may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Much like obesity, healthcare, crime statistics, infant mortality rates metrics United States sucks dirty ass compared developed nations...those nations self-evident proof *national* response conpletely, insanely wrong.

Trump refused make national policy, downplayed severity undercut experts every single fucking step way. normal human dead inside monster would handled differently, either party. got sociopath.

Anyway. Well that‚Äôs you‚Äôre South America lol. (I‚Äôm history teacher... know Argentina is.) screwed around much Cold War. 

We afraid South American countries becoming communist sorts really sketchy things there. Good job finally joining team science. mean, learn hard way, make room squad. don‚Äôt fuck November kick out. Almost health workers (nurses, doctors, techs, orderlies) try protect themselves. use PPE hand hygiene, routinely. 

What really tells us is, people use PPE hand hygiene, still exposed. And, exposed small enough dose end mild, even completely asymptomatic, infections.

All PPE hygiene also help protect workers patients, period infected worker might infectious without knowing it. It‚Äôs based real data. early estimates made kinds wild Oooooo... snap Next thing wondering supply homes rent low! No... best remains ""stay hell home"". Break comment bit, maybe understand it. change death rate covid-19. 

You don‚Äôt understand statistics, **average** stay death 13.7 months. 53 percent die 6 months placement 47% die 5 years average 31 months. Probably little since they're masked experienced infection control. know I'd like able smell taste breathe. [Any day's earlier think. fact, actively

Freezing payments instead overprinting means whatever little money somebody makes saved still value. *if Trump. think that's humans are. huge percentage shitty. thing care ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù. many phone calls make, many scripts filled, fast phones picked fast drive bus serviced. Fuck employees motto. 

Oh, you‚Äôve long making much money, find way make life living hell leave accord. especially true pharmacist. you‚Äôre especially good job, expect run pharmacy even need 10 extra hands job. 

I know ran pharmacy while. bad measles. 

Unfortunately happens make lives great deal difficult. one third depends truth talking about. Fucci good putting spin data. wonder many people would dead hadn‚Äôt blocked Hydroxychloroquine? wonder many people permanent damage Remdesivir? 

It sad day country criminals like Fucci praised saviors. REPUBLICAN SUPPOSED LEAD GOD DAMMED COUNTRY. fucks sake dont understand. fuck Wit dod absolutely nothing pushed false narratives made WORSE. point flu vaccine prevent getting flu. something stopped. Vaccines general keep getting it, stopping spread secondary effect. 

Whether keeps dying specific irrelevant. NEED live. drop dead immediately without it.  Ah.. opium keep masses distracted real issue? right ! act like ""go online"" answer simple damn naive.

I agree said except last bit. 

We know already serious problem low-income students. already grossly underserved. Whether in-school remote better. Much responsibility lies parents value education. ""In-school"" naive ""go online"" constituency. get 80 90% solution short order KEEP WORKING broader systemic problems. We'll better society simply letting disruptive kids hold everyone back. focus low performing kids finding solutions may cookie cutter one-size-fits-all. 

I think socialization element over-hyped agendas (like free daycare). 

To reiterate, think lower income students already languishing left behind schools naive.  Ha, bad, Whatever site grabbed numbers must really off. UN site memory. 

Vietnam done rest world done Wuhan locked down. nearly lost end July managed pull back got control.

Either way, argue more. really trying get compassion poor guy lived 5 months hard lockdowns potentially see massive clusterfuck hope worse enemy. Bruh can't even spell ""cause"" I'd say bigger problems News flash: don‚Äôt coherent strategy *anything* fruit test positive yes RNA pulled noise. Like famous black hole picture. 

The test still flawed covid still worth worrying about. America lol. entitlement built many people. disagree you, I'm convinced level ""herd resistance"" play hard-hit populous areas US right now. 

As suggest, think hard pressed argue area US anywhere near commonly-quoted ~70% immunity needed actual herd immunity. Unless testing catching absolutely minuscule minority real count infections (far lower theorized ~10%), can't true.  

But question (and honest question): explain behavior US metrics? 

Take examples July ""problem children"" - FL, TX, AZ, CA. believe states ""reopened"" loosened restrictions May/June. saw subsequent meteoric rise cases following weeks. FL, TX, CA began running mid June peaked mid-late July, AZ couple weeks ahead peaking instead early July. details could bit since obviously live places, far know, pretty different responses outbreaks. CA shut hard second time, shelter-in-place orders, tons businesses closed, etc. FL TX sort nothing, adopting mask mandates pretty late game allowing bars, restaurants, theaters operate 50% capacity, gyms full. course, FL infamously opened Disney World height outbreak. AZ took in-between approach, locking mask mandates bit earlier fully closing gyms bars 2 months. 

But light that, what's numbers? 4 states followed almost exact trajectory end. Arizona, furthest front four, peaked right July 1. September 1, 8 weeks later, surge cases back ever started. Florida looking almost exactly same; peaked roughly July 15, 6 weeks later, cases consistently declining look likely reach pre-surge levels within 2 3 weeks, like Arizona. Texas also similar, peaking mid July decline weeks now. timeline looks ever slightly slower since seem experienced bit plateau late July/early August instead steady decline, still looking potentially reach pre-surge case levels end month. California bit harder get bead peaked latest, late July, experienced minor second spike mid August whatever reason. far looks like they're exact 8 week track, current trend continues ~4 weeks back May levels. 

So explain this? explain 4 areas hit super hard roughly time, pretty wide range response it, yet following really similar 8ish week trajectory cases? almost hard interpret anything natural progression virus population. that's case, continuing explode populations, far past peaks achieve? all, places like TX FL little fight it. lockdown, shelter-in-place, little business closures, late adoption masks. much anything combat aerosolized spread. much anything encourage people behave responsibly. explain kind herd immunity? 

Of course scientific evidence this. one seems able provide scientific answer kind. virus continued rip areas high rate? stop vastly short 70% benchmark? progression TX FL look similar CA response dissimilar? Could simply likely infected (public/service workers, healthcare workers, low-income households lots people, etc.) already infected high enough rate they're spreading anymore, virus hamstrung favorite environments/conditions large amounts immune hosts? 

**Edit: sorry novel, got much longer wanted to. thinking lot recently.** said quiet part loud that‚Äôs people aren‚Äôt buying anymore it‚Äôs gotten political Indeed, not. makes say that? bigger country challenging derive coherent response control pandemic.

Only countries comparable size/population China U.S., India, Australia Russia. China, Aussies pandemic control moment. read response far, Australia strict quaratine policy that's bordering authoratarian. Yes course. know? However like look it. Health reason ass. mean yeah is. holiday season (most of) europe could take flight places today. Depending area finding Covid treatment works would poor job identifying area cases. Knowing there‚Äôs outbreak somewhere 200sq km area almost 400,000 people doesn‚Äôt narrow search much. It‚Äôs definitely near good actually testing people tracking tracing follow outbreaks. Florida hits keep coming short Recruitment vaccine studies rapid process. Since July, Pfizer recruited 11,000 volunteers study. pace, Pfizer finish enrollment October. course, enrollment beginning phase 3 trial. wait months see whether vaccine works. analyze data prepare submission. agency analyze data. Even everyone involved rushes things, hard see new drug application could approved end EUA, hand, might get vaccine market November December. EUA might issued basis strong phase 2 data, interim data phase 3 trial. that's Novavax might sneak market first.

Also says Oxford good (monkeys), mRNA based Moderna Pfizer, approved, needs storage, risks, reliable etc etc.

Feels like FUD opinion piece. seriously think many kids diligently sit classes work school. 

We've months plan make work (attendance tracking, attention tracking, in-service training technology best practices remote learning) focused school-as-free-daycare we've squandered time. 

Somebody needs thinking January. Mr. de Blasio. it. Exactly. likely lead (maybe statistically significant?) drop life expectation increase health problems elderly people (including dementia) decades come.   Spain managed somehow. It‚Äôs running. 100% agree you! Yup. Way much voter suppression &amp; election tampering going on. know people look long string awful decisions allowed US population decide trend magically reverse come fall. USA one student puts zero effort think confused Chinese French. That's thing though. Welfare programs *are* human rights, way police, fire, medical services are.

Rights complicated; negative rights (the right harmed specific way either individual state) positive rights (the right individual state perform action benefit.) come many different places:

* Constitutional rights come guiding framework laws come from. Examples US include freedom speech right contract enforcement.
* Statutory rights come body law constitution. Examples include right equal treatment workplace regardless gender/race right fire/medical/police services.
* Contractual rights come contracts individuals parties. Examples might include pet free property (a landlords right animals living house) tenant's right landlord paying water bill.

Taxes another thing.

Rights enforceable without funding, funding come one three sources:

* Direct taxation, income tax;
* Indirect taxation, Value Added Tax Sales Tax; or
* Direct payment services.

Generally speaking, less wealth someone resources required enforce rights. Therefore, best tax approach minimizes burden lower wealth individuals, require lowest amount total funding.

Direct taxation allows taxes impact individuals proportionately *and* minimal tax burden individuals requiring financial help, direct taxation tends primary funding method governments. fuck?! So, find vaccine what? fuck wrong motherfucker named Trump! Lmao actually built infrastructure. May confused European imperialists still extracting raw materials Africa? sure: serious sarcastic? could've somehow seen coming...

Plus poverty mentioned earlier. cost consequence-free operation keep schools closed.

And let's really brutal- lives saving elderly vulnerable closer death anyway. think anyone claiming process describe (i.e sampling treatment facility using replacement (rather supplement) actual individual testing). 

You start standard monitoring process treatment facilities key upstream sewer lines.  allows track data virus (especially rural areas organizing individual testing problematic). allows identify populations active outbreaks take action. action would either sewage test upstream activate form protocol request force impacted population get tested individually. (either pooled PCR testing hopefully eventually form rapid non-lab test).  contact trace anyone identified process. also continue testing anyone symptoms (and tracing anyone tests positive that)

The sewage testing, theory, substantially efficient, cost effective, less personally disruptive starting blanket testing individuals.  Especially cases where, average, virus present.

Also, even testing done treatment facilities- 15k treatment facilities US- average number people served per facility would around 20k (rather 400k suggested). Happened first semester college. None professors really cared tearing campus. Sure forgave attendance, relief catch perpetually behind semester.

He told MPs: ‚ÄúThe first line defence \[remains\] social distancing personal hygiene. shortly launching campaign reminding people help stop spread coronavirus ‚Äî ‚Äòhands, face, space get test symptoms‚Äô. Everyone part play basics. virus thrives social contact.‚Äù

While confirmed cases rising Britain, part due intensive testing hotspot areas Mr Hancock referred data showing hospital admissions deaths continuing fall. Yesterday, three deaths confirmed 60 people ventilators Covid-19, 3,300 peak.

Mr Hancock defended contact tracing, described ‚Äúsecond line defence‚Äù virus, despite concern slow overly centralised. Test Trace merged Public Health England National Institute Health Protection MPs questioned wisdom administrative upheaval key stage pandemic.

‚ÄúThis making sure well prepared possible ensuring total focus new National Institute Health Protection prevention infectious diseases,‚Äù Mr Hancock said. ‚ÄúThere times make changes try make sure systems working effectively possible.‚Äù

 Contact tracing needed least mass vaccination possible. Mr Hancock said: ‚ÄúThe best-case scenario remains vaccine year. Since House last met \[in July\], trials gone well.‚Äù

Britain contracts six different vaccines would ‚Äúinsist safety efficacy‚Äù, said. end Brexit transition period December, European Medicines Agency must license vaccine use Britain Mr Hancock said would change law allow British regulators approve one earlier.

This would ‚Äúensure vaccine approved \[Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency\] deployed whether European licence MHRA standards equal highest world‚Äù.

To ensure enough doses given quickly, Mr Hancock said would ask parliament ‚Äúto approve broader range qualified clinical personnel deploy vaccine‚Äù. 

It thought include pharmacists, midwives, medical students vets. consultation changes states ministers power approve ‚Äúpeople registered healthcare professionals‚Äù give vaccines last resort. days flatten curve! nation will, country size means fucking us won't.

Of course, proportions vary based behavior.

70% assumes transmission distributed evenly throughout population. extreme distribution, fewer superspreaders need immune, transmission stops. coarseness american culture perception others is, frankly, horrifying much rest world.

The probable reason want staff wearing medical grade masks still needed frontline healthcare workers, EMT's, police, etc, nature job likely exposed COVID infected person.

If functioning federal government (USA), supply PPE would place, along rapid testing contact tracing. don't, CDC initially recommending mask wearing (they knew supply medical grade masks would disappear told people go ahead could help protect them)

I saw story UK teachers students wearing masks, would interfere learning. political stunt, basis science. similar hospitals telling non-COVID staff wear masks, could interfere patient satisfaction surveys.

Masks shown reduce risk spreading COVID others (which happen asymptomatically) also potentially reduce amount personal exposure (a lower ""dose"" virus entering body may produce less deadly case COVID, allow body fight successfully). beginning pandemic, Governor Tony Evers top state health advisors repeated mantra, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going listen science.‚Äù¬†



They keep listening scientists medical professionals hear option want.


Like Dr. alien DNA demon semen.


If 999 1000 scientists recommend N95 masks, idiots hunt lone scientist recommending N95's. may recomend distanced learning care. figure way ignore also. **Iceland**

Has Tegnell: YES Amazon Glad hear it. Hang there. Regards Nth Qld. hope prediction right. Also hoping masks general still norm (for people want go outside sick, even covid) lessen people getting sick general good reason. care people, states wears masks takes protective measure respect others even doesn‚Äôt believe himself. think said really dumb still 99% better dumb people don‚Äôt believe don‚Äôt care others course. guess didn‚Äôt see numerous reports point showing anti-bodies shed months? heard class action that? Respect. dunno I‚Äôd expose them. Plenty people running Costco‚Äôs defense kick people store wearing masks. Lmao course is. got source this? guy fucking evil moron.

The government.... isnt hard dude I've heard nurses told can't bring N95 reuse fit tested N95 masks hospital provides. I've never heard hospital telling nurse working COVID patients can't wear N95 all. That's OSHA violation. worked great Trump wanted photo op front church upside bible China buying raw materials Aus ever before, despite tough talk.  would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary¬†Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor¬†Safety.

Actually. allow KN95 (the Chinese equivalent)? Fuck allowing employees protect themselves! would give essential Liberty, purchase little temporary¬†Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor¬†Safety. crime? stupid, dont think illegal. u post link debunking? haven‚Äôt seen it. Thank you. Right. ‚ÄòMurika way way way nuanced. really dumb fuckers. fair, wife works health care, back mandatory testing first rolled (back late April think?), took 18 days tests done results issued. sounds like they‚Äôve finally got shit together! said memory happening (Iwas upset unions), quick read update fallout. second this. big pharmacies care patient. number them. cut costs every opportunity trying squeeze employees. 

worked one 6 years (not CVS, another well known pharmacy chain Canada, say which), recently quit taking toll keep up. never ending battle day. Ah yes I‚Äôve thoughts before. Lovely dream! it‚Äôs it‚Äôs impossible, truly seems people want type change. don‚Äôt know get there. people shrug forget altogether. I‚Äôm guilty extent I‚Äôm highly prone anger/rage topic. make quite difficult ourselves! Please tell also one people refuses wear masks socially distance. That's great statement. bookmarked it.

And let state interesting fact.

As September 2, 2020, indigenous cases mainland China 16 consecutive days

In meantime, numbers hear mainland Chinese cases entered quarantined countries

Did Western media report this?

sadly get either. article mainstream publication yesterday:

""Is Covid-19 Airborne?"" 
Aug 31, 2020 guess they're making distinction droplets aerosols calling one ""airborne""?  Congrats best wishes!!!! Yay!!! Thank *god* it‚Äôs kindergartner. odds healthy kindergartener dying covid... .00012%? serious? enable it, that‚Äôs even state contact tracing going on. tried turn mine on, it‚Äôs use PA. google Apple update phones allow user wants it. Stop believing Karens post misinformation Facebook issue. It‚Äôs good thing nobody decided give vaccine program name implied reckless speed.

That would bad public‚Äôs confidence. Exactly- conversely, Arizona, person would admitted hospital Covid19, complications like pneumonia, state pressuring medical
Community call covid death, coroner essentially last word. Either way, I‚Äôve learned trust (besides Dr. Fauci, even though usually couple weeks behind advice, wish he‚Äôd be) excess death numbers. really think far 2020 goes, excess deaths covid. Let‚Äôs forget Trump vested interest making sure tourism continues Florida. investing? genuinely sympathy individuals invested let‚Äôs say 1 property 12 tenants? 

You realize they‚Äôre responsible upkeep maintenance right? isnt buying stock making killing; investment work maintain order profitable investment. 

You example failure education system, friend comrade, prefer. helpful comment article efficacy masks Wonder they're conservative testing. Good contact tracing help fence many cases, long available capacity, make use cast net wider, try pick contact tracing missed? nothing location tracking.
It still work based Bluetooth.

Only differences instead app it‚Äôs integrated iOS settings. poor mother :( 

RIP, Astrid. expect group people personally subsidize effort? Great. don‚Äôt also groceries, gas, cable, hospital bills? fair, could distrustful vaccine. [Imagine one quarter said take issue halting pandemic lives tenants important OPs investment.  doubt would happy PERSONALLY forced pay neighbors rent can‚Äôt won‚Äôt. Questioning: yes. Dismissing: no. Depends area, crowds, anyone wearing masks. Urgent cares implemented Covid care precautions far safer beaches crowded people- young old- wearing masks social distancing. 

Plus ocean city isn‚Äôt beach. It‚Äôs board walk party town insisting must gone, partaking party lifestyle. 

Regardless, limit everything do. Manaus probably herd immunity (~50-60% infected). Ahhh...I thought like before. denial, yes, like AIDS, they've tried place form moral judgement personal failing onto victim. Obesity/unhealthy lifestyle become new homosexuality. cope denial telling ""Well, I'm safe **I'M** like **THEM**"". 
Hmmm... Agreed HCWs likely detect infection.

 think HCWs tending covid patients waaay exposure average store clerk. However they'll also better PPE (I hope!) maybe exposure differences would cancel out. motivation criticizing government betterment society, acceptable government to

The motivation criticizing government overthrow it, government categorically unacceptable.

China different United States regard.  It‚Äôs insane people acting op‚Äôs financial issues matter less tenants‚Äô. Op responsible ensuring ‚Äúhuman right housing‚Äù one tenants have. 
Landlords like op shouldn‚Äôt considered enforcers maintainers unrecognized right housing. Sorry, tents type housing. Tin roofs poles make housing. 
The standards us live means something human right to.

The us‚Äô main issue fucking education taught critically think. That‚Äôs exemplified entire ‚Äúfuck landlord‚Äù mentality. UES parents. wanted schools re-open saw richer friends able afford private pod learning sending kids private school. Therefore, ones send child UES public schools demanded school open ‚ÄúI want thing richer friends have.‚Äù put parents wanted opt home learning disadvantage today online schooling delayed (bc potential teacher strike) potentially begin Sept 21st, could delayed further. Many affluent parents also can‚Äôt stand teachers demanding stay home multitude reasons. 

It‚Äôs definitely different everywhere ideally kids back school. However, it‚Äôs clear plans every area different preventing kids education truly need point. thought NYC giving food cards still families need meal pickup? Come on, I'm sure we've learned lesson. 

/s Well, guess Walgreens me. corporate greed. posters, Governor Abbot used tweet much better California. stopped deaths got equal California. Prick. Inc death rate increase elderly Florida. Decuntis actively trying kill population. Aren‚Äôt cases skyrocketing hospitalizations fall elsewhere? would expect differently there? essentially first wave rn? Yeah surprised stuff Pareno axioms tbh.

This dangerous intrusive breach privacy allowed. I'm sorry bearer bad news unfortunately stop spreading parents. conversations spend time living room/kitchen/bathrooms... sick sick I'm sorry.

Just avoid going much hop shower soon get home best do. hope bedroom, try spend time let come in. Unfortunately mask cure answer precaution public remind people maintain distance.

The Coronavirus particle small float air land surface nearby, unless wearing super duper gas mask filters every bit passing air, stop spreading particles around house. 

I know voted comment real. fool thinking mask stop getting sick spreading it. Think like virus adjust life avoid contracting it

Edit: I'm saying mask help, obviously does. take measures avoid spreading cannot solely depend mask. already sick? yes, mask help everything else like leave bedroom avoid sharing bathroom. live life normal, mask anything inconvenience, especially reuse one touch day. many people misinformed trying clear things up. lifestyle habbits mask aid in, cure virus mention: face masks became routine virus. people used call Syphilis: weight historical precedent exactly standard conduct mentioned, especially including Spanish Flu. international structures 20th century UN gave us hope could break pattern...

Pompous Pompeo (and Trump pals) really wants us return past, he? Maybe they're sick virus anxiety, pigeonholing anxiety manifestation mental health issues. Poor child :( It‚Äôs even that. Prisoners trying intentionally get infected get consideration early release. problem lack regulation. know UK much 'any face covering' acceptable. needs refined regulated further. Still Shillin? misinformation, spreading misinformation. Sorry, quit marketing throwing stupid ads fku vac every damn year. scare tactic every year. Try something new. I'm getting stuidoes shown flu vac protect strands worse itd usually behind strands running around even vac yet. Mainland China locally confirmed new cases COVID-19 16 days row, life returned normal Beijing, am, except need wear mask go out! I‚Äôll echo commenter harshly. Investments definitely risk. alternative MASS evictions would send shockwaves society probably end screwing life worse long run, either wrecked economy, higher Covid rates, higher crime, etc. 

I mean really, people hundreds millions billions ones paying this. you, definitely poorest. wouldn‚Äôt change way life even little bit. vote politicians hell bent protecting trillion dollar tax breaks things. News alert: re-infection thing. naked psychological bias proof positive culture politics broken. mock suffering people basic facts situation make uncomfortable want tone police social environment bubble wishful thinking popped. really sad mocking suffering people. forum requires use title published posting gets removed.

The title says person infectious five days. whole article even doubts use face masks. article basically written podcast leading German Corona expert. looking - thank much! all-cause mortality data certainly seems telling. anyone ignore many excess deaths!? Plus kids teens pretty forgetful (I mean, guess be) schools masks hand give kids forgot whose parents believe them. Overall Texas still better average US state.

The average skewed high mass number deaths early pandemic (in NY, NJ, New England).

Texas actually well median deaths-per-100k population: 19th. (The median around 33, Colorado ranked #25 33.8 deaths/100k CA ranked #26 33.3 deaths/100k). None [reasons Peru's lockdown apply Florida (or US). developing nation.

People streets less paranoid 2 3 weeks ago many grandparents left? Yes, bud, course can! teach middle school now. sure let nap couch library area. Public schools get funding based attendance. think make ""perfect attendance"" huge reward American public schools?

Attendance going tank worried parents pull kids class classmate tested positive COVID, funding follow. nurses wearing PPE corona unit? 400,000 gave billions TAX MONEY months ago injecting trillions stock market. Mainland China locally confirmed new cases COVID-19 16 days row, life returned normal Beijing, am, except need wear mask go out!

My daughter going kindergarten first time next Friday, feels like COVID-19 moving away us, renewed focus everyday topics like health care, transportation, housing, education. Come Spamfest, meatiest music festival year,

Is accurate enough you? uncle CVS least 25 years got fired. He‚Äôd CVS still Melville, chain focused New England, stores janky little places sold pharmacy items greeting cards, became mini-marts pharmacy counter. don‚Äôt know exactly why, think something medication error, imagine happens every pharmacist sooner later. vomit nonsense Internet smartphones, sit pockets day near-constant contact GPS satellites.

Hell yeah. feeling bad landlords. too. think shithole might exaggeration, still. would doctors put ‚Äúsuspense‚Äù cause death? live life letting articles like scare shit because, accounts, COVID stay.

I'm saying stop living life. think unwise compare virus viruses they're thing carry long-term-consequences---because idea that's true not. Sometimes, cure worse disease.

""The cure"" ""worse disease"" people, large, make half-ass bare minimum effort embrace best practices (social distancing, disciplined use PPE, taking unnecessary risks, etc.). Unfortunately, ""YOLO"" much important concerned unknown long-term health effects, I'd assume rushing get vaccine becomes available. 

Actually, probably depends. vaccine fast-tracked, best practices, I'd hesitant accept vaccine. experts say expect vaccine sometime next year...so ""Operation: Warp Speed"" approves vaccine November? That's shaky fuck, I'll wait next H1N1 example, problematic people issue lining get shot.

Are referring 1976? 48 million doses given, 532 developed  Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (0.001%). 

That's acceptable risk me. Guess metric use front runner first vaccine announced? Certainly current front runner. talking Chinese CanSino Biologics Inc vaccine. Still shillin? 6% part could due undetected problems COVID-19 exacerbated. Allow clarify second ""High"" would number new cases per day that's least 150% 



When first time?

And country 1/8th cases per capita badly? Curious 460k people attended. event started 7th ran 16th. average incubation period 2-14 days, median time 4-5 days. seems people exhibit severe symptoms around day 10. event ended 16 days ago. realize people sub going take 1 case as, ""too many"", let's say 1000 people infected, people attended would be, .02%. Leading event, sub full people predicting many used harleys would sale people died. seems people upset prediction seem coming fruition. People standards acceptable risk, you, dictate level acceptable risk is, including people may infected attended. individuals come contact individuals somehow, means accepted certain level risk. liberals think end pandemic protesting. like people PC's boot order messed BIOS. politics boots brain.  I'd like think seeing kids perhaps upside maybe forced work pandemic.

She probably making best horrible situation. know super fun say anti vaxxers root evil, maybe pushing untested vaccines really great idea? Can‚Äôt read title. take vaccine Fauci's daughters take vaccine. think that's unreasonable. trust extent, he's older fewer years live chronic condition something goes wrong, he's also high risk needs take it. daughters taking make feel confident. don‚Äôt understand political thing all

The pandemic makes Trump look bad, ahs denied. rich want people back work keep making money. simple that.  Gee if, people's safety, asked carry around id card entered clubs, bars, bought alcohol, that'd pure fascism.  Look, like Chinese Government, huge fan Tedros. sharing information Virus, lead two things.

1. Pandemic last longer
2. vaccine may effective US greedy

You completely missing point. like China Uncensored, clear listen say think all. pro-life comes woman fuck pull bootstraps Georgia... am.i surprised? school suspended attendance certificates year, hopefully help kids school little. staying home. people victims rich people propaganda machine. past exposure common cold coronaviruses provide cross immunity COVID-19 -- speculated could true -- could past exposure SARS-CoV-2 provide cross immunity common cold coronaviruses future? never said 40% would still dead, said ""many"" group would be. That‚Äôs taught  Hell growing mom keep home young, go work her, stay home would fired(at state). Even fired afford it. either went school homeless. Gotta love America exploitation poor. band aid fix. months unpaid rent need paid expires. 

Lazy ass House Senate don‚Äôt care shot though, go vacations left right. close idea heard somewhere:

Throw big festival COVID19 deniers.

Give free music, free food, free drinks, job succurance etc. 

under condition:

once enter leave 6 weeks.

A shame close perfection.... That‚Äôs fucking awful. Please stay safe can. wish luck. nations wealthy today stripping resources nations subsequently poor. hypocritical want horde resources rest world benefiting leeching it. 

So, many nations can't self-sufficient. Hell, imagine US becoming entirely self-sufficient timely manner? benefit working partners acquire goods. numbers aren‚Äôt really going down? see accusation made time

And true, there's bunch youtube videos people welded apartments China Jan/Feb Viruses tend get less lethal become endemic, course generations humans. 

The coronaviruses think ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù viruses may deadly COVID-19 originally, would probably recorded history began. 

It takes long time.

I guess I‚Äôm saying is, met someone sharp would take note. find analyzing degree someone informed. Suicides, overdoses, lack medical treatment people petrified virus avoided hospital. 

As well, build since last bad flu season 2017/2018 elderly going die whatever next virus came be. average age death virus average age death. tells everything. 21 percent hawaii's economy tourism, derpie. read six articles past months said results would available September, vaccine itself. read that?

Look know people situation...but 2 weeks ago plan childcare... mean come jobs school days 6 hours.  Better right cusp effective one otherwise dumb IHME predicting India overtake US total deaths sometime December 1st. projections seem really high India‚Äôs staggeringly high. projections countries seem pretty modest comparison. 

Us 189,000 projected 317,000= increase 128,000 deaths amounts 1422+ deaths /day

India 66,000 projected 445,000= increase 379,000 deaths amounts 4211 deaths/day

Brazil 122,000 projected 182,000=increase 60,000 deaths amounts 667 American wanna let know ""Pledge allegiance"" dystopian shit I've seen, indoctrinating kids worshipping piece cloth. Interesting would use prevent evictions mitigation efforts could used year.  Seems like bit stretch evictions would health rather economic issue. downvoted stating fact? wasn‚Äôt much testing March/April compared now, lot NY cases missed Hawaii isn‚Äôt even top ten tourism state. send infected home spread damn place. point taking SARS-CoV-2 drawing comparisons known viruses long term effects studied many decades (in cases).

SARS-CoV-2 brand new coronavirus. ***We idea affect human body, long-term.***

Or disagree? lawyer CDC claiming authority SECTION 361OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT 42 CFR 70.2 (from order found 42 CFR 70.2 Section 361 measures CDC take prevent spread disease local governments enough. main question whether eviction moratorium is, ""such measures prevent spread diseases he/she deems reasonably necessary"". guess eviction moratorium would help lessen spread COVID 42 CFR 70.2 seems broad could used justify pretty much anything. I'm curious see ends court not. teach special needs middle schoolers? got 3 year old 5 year old wear masks properly 1st attempt. Great. I'm still assuming transmit easily there's scientific consensus this.

New studies preprints interesting can't rely robust data, coming hot US pretty soon!

Until err side caution! USA #1 USA #1 

We literally LOST soft power around world.... spent billions trillions years developing position Trump admin lost us. news? college sending us emails new cases. add complexity madness keep mind: Nearly universally, US non-US based pharmaceutical companies focus bringing products US market first - gain far profit.

In words, huge price health care US funding massive portion medical advances. making executives rich. actually often pays work needed invent new treatments.

Case point look recent news French firm stopped French government giving US market priority new covid educated guess would funds sort stuff. like he's lab coat developing vaccine whatever. know people like Bill Gates. Yeah, he's rich, yeah, sometimes rich people bad things, evidence far happening, pure speculation, hence ""conspiracy"". Maybe he's loud voice he's famous, word speak medical scientific community since may may fund it. I‚Äôm extreme enough go far. age I‚Äôll probably ok virus. probability getting deathly ill pretty low. kids may get sick probability getting extremely ill low. 

What bothers older teachers work with, older members family. half staff work old, majority risk based preexisting conditions. know many students come multi-generational households depend grandparents school care. certainly high risk group. 

This said guinea pig. Statistically chances dying low. eventually chances getting sick, students getting sick, high. don‚Äôt data right exactly happens COVID schools government wants know. test. site. Every post sub filled comments like above, saying leaders LiStEn eXpErTs. good rhetoric critical thought. understanding, yes, that's essentially it. 6% people died Covid otherwise completely healthy people comordities. Sweden them. employ strategy COVID nationwide lockdown one get cigarettes. lock months everyone addicted time quit can‚Äôt get anymore. would literally save lives covid lockdowns. Stupid question here: anyone die COVID-19 *without* comorbidity? Like far know COVID causes death due respiratory failure sometimes heart failure. 6% people die COVID neither these? exactly directly caused die, then? Also, Poe's Law real. already strange numbers look death stats year far vs previous years average point? Literally every time tried assert power got pushback accusations dictator, followed lawyers CNN explaining ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt power that‚Äù. would authority you‚Äôre talking wartime. really need decouple health insurance employment. **It literally says mean length stay 5 months, defined number months nursing home admission death.**. you. die? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è deaths/hospitalization look? Actually zero deaths last 7 days.

Glad know worst death rates world fine long happen beginning, lmao. 

Just take bad faith argument leave, dude. Honestly, NJ, clear pattern emerged richer towns 60% + sending kids working class lower income areas gone full remote hybrid option. Oddly, town, fairly well area, lower middle income, minority, and, yes, ""working class"" parents opted remote even though hybrid. lot work home parents sending kids school. this.

so many americans dont understand basics cause effect.

If covid causes organ failure, covid cause main cause death, organ failure chain reaction main cause. virus hit heart.

Same thing happened me, took 5 years recover cardiologists surprised recover. heart functioning less 50% normal. high functioning amateur athlete. Anyone else feel like they‚Äôre sizing people‚Äôs intelligence often day day life since March? don‚Äôt mean judging obviously playing full deck willfully ignorant. mean people immediate environment leadership positions discuss ‚Äúnews‚Äù virus less agreed upon originally announced places like Italy China last spring. We're getting band names back spam now? comparing much people move around tourism heavy state america whole comparing peak decline*

meanwhile another tourism heavy state shows much larger decline florida belies idea FL locked average.

given tourists staying home Florida roughly decline states means lock hard relative states.

*honestly, comparing peaks decline already bullshit lockdowns person replied produced proof.

that make proof worth shit. mean want feel like beat them, fine declare victory. Thanks. Maybe digital passports pre-cursor ID chip? 

Not believe this, I'm following thread potential nonsense. 

Why, though, Bill Gates speaking stuff first place? know he's philanthropist, guy? formal education virology anything sort? makes loud voice, wonder... kinesiology major coming hot! Wait til tell went 10 years restaurant.

My point calls would waste way much time. I'm trashing 30 dollar pill touched ground briefly.  lmao!

are helmets NFL stupid well?  Cousins going long way squeeze Drago quote rocky IV. speak personal experience wearing N95 keep dust particles cutting concrete. Even without 100% secure fit, really really effective keeping dust mouth nose. Picking prescription really pretty low exposure thing - doc sends electronically, get delivered.

Lots prescriptions involve techs handling pills bare hands. good washing either. Hard pprove logical stance.

Agreed. I'm saying reasoning behind N95 ban stupid, probably correct. fat increases mortality probably spread. think better testing contact tracing.

something still missing US, something imPOTUS seems unconcerned about, since magically disappear, vaccine tomorrow-ish. even talking COVID past tense... seems relatively cheap honestly. spent 2.5 days regular hospital bed something minor bill $30k. truly ironic part...they claiming medical freedom, yet zero understanding need protect others wearing masks. mind blowing. Take little context. literally said always wears mask peoples protection peace mind care.   Republicans love bring children world, kill slowly time take away safety nets.

They love bring wage slaves world. GOP evil shit bags. Fit test pre use, yearly, exit medical surveillance exams required employees wear respirators.

If employee signs voluntary respirator use form releases employer requirements possible ask sign form hazard actually requires respirator use (like right regular mask suffices)

Source: I‚Äôm health safety professional Allowing stupidity prevail send country civil war....exhibit A....America. guess makes sense. COVID picks many people *would* died soon, especially first wave ran rampant nursing homes.

That make less terrifying though. people long term injuries, ones *wouldn't* normally died, terrible COVID-19 death is... yeah, really looking end lockdown time soon. Actually many lease agreements assumable new owner case sale, make work find buyer who's willing continue lease terms.

Which might difficult present environment present renter default terms. Tom Bradykinin? far anxious say something generally angry enough somebody feels right endanger health clearly step lean far away possible glare/stare. always hope staring make feel least little bit self conscious, may wishful thinking. Well, fuck. same? would require rest county cases sky high levels, definitely want. Retaliation thing. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* know it. Broke hand. Needed surgery. Surgery alone 19,000. distancing keeps Covid-19 hovering around 1

I think might wishful thinking, unfortunately. agree around 1, doubt social distancing got us maintained USA right now, coming weeks.

That said, I'm really stoked minimization flu season. I'll probably get shot week. attack argument, person, better #THE VIRUS KILLS PEOPLE ASSHOLE They're typically processing data speed review.

That's pretty basic point missing. wonder many deaths urban areas that's sick rural people sent? Seriously, rural hospitals handful beds sparse equipment. Right. think it‚Äôs interesting considered ppe healthcare workers considered sufficient teachers. Like phlebotomist, isn‚Äôt aerosolizing procedure, wouldn‚Äôt considered ppe wearing cloth mask. ok teachers times may instructing students close distance would wear one. point CDC says cloth masks count ppe healthcare workers.. it‚Äôs great schools actively disallow teachers wearing surgical masks anything ‚Äústronger‚Äù cloth mask etc. Pelosi already gotten vaccine guess They're turning news represents reality live virus way. They're hyped idea consequences virus unacceptable they're attached idea never personally catch it.

The vaccine progress looking less less like eradication like flu vaccine; something controls epidemic end it. refuse acknowledge acceptable outcome. people want live like forever. mean already lived like corona, get feel like hero morally superior recluse. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs aggravating risk giving others COVID? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. three weeks many milestones rise.

It‚Äôs much herd immunity pseudo herd immunity given current interventions.

The people distancing, masks, shuttered bars, contributes situation R0 less one.

But pull back cases rise again.

You also situation big cities might R0 less one, rural areas smaller cities still experiencing growth. agree 100%   People want cause world ending. really fall line Evers far. I'm bit confused seen heard source announcement provided DHS. links announcement article either. FOX6 Milwaukee seems carrier info regarding this. Makes question legitimacy.

This also 1 district (I'm guessing Whitefish Bay article). weird statewide mandate Yeah, you‚Äôre either comprehending willfully obtuse. May explain reason even though many countries already second wave infected cases, death roll much lower first wave? Got stats common is? it‚Äôs possible doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs probable I‚Äôve years, guess came advantage knowing expect that. chief benefit feeling need waste time putting appearances office write code get conference calls people cities, obviously done anywhere. Well date. June 24th. bumps treading up. area increase cases normal Europe. Germany still better most.

But living here, shocking taken off. People wear masks to. wear nose, dripping wet. Parents anything children wear masks. Kids fine it, adults can't handle it. 

In humble opinion, seems attack countries high population fat people. Germans generally fat Americans British. Sweds lock ok even less fat people (when went look pretty damn fit). really fall line Evers far. I'm bit confused seen heard source announcement provided DHS. links announcement article either.

This also 1 district (I'm guessing Whitefish Bay article). weird statewide mandate Definitely better. still view slightly upgraded cloth mask.

Yes. fit. It‚Äôs literally FDAs website. war loops provide enough tension make adequate seal. Well said! Let guess want teach parent them? comes Nov 3 I‚Äôll probably wait bit There's research says R0 flu 1.4, R0 Covid-19 3 lived way used live.

So math. Social distancing keeps Covid-19 hovering around 1 keep R0 flu way 1. almost depressing sometimes, people genuinely want stay homes rest lives shame anyone wants get back world. Fauci part Trump administration. Thanks providing stark reality. bother wearing helmet? warrant make okay. idea what's actually happening that's logic. particulate filters last quite time unless highly contaminated environment really dusty environment. I'm sure exactly lifespan got mask couple weeks ago recently started wearing it. previously using N95 since March. still it, keep car case I'm situation I'm without one whatever reason. N95 still fine could breathe easily right could six months ago. know factors that, think long breathe fine wearing good.

As far rest mask besides filters 3M built really great. something break work properly, came huge manual lots instructions detailed list replacement parts order...so sense mask could last lifetime. I'm happy gets 2022, believe start emerging fully functional society again.

I think people hear fine. Home Depot weekend spent good half hour customer service desk going order that's gone awry person worked seem trouble hearing me, that's background noise there. feel like sound different wearing it, though. Yea put specially handpicked men moon went extensive training top already impressive backgrounds.

That‚Äôs bit different trying common masses.

The risk tolerance much higher first scenario. That‚Äôs fucked up‚Ä¶ Russians Chinese candidate vaccines succeed becomes political power. Reporting social distancing people stupid fine.

TLDR: Supreme Court allowed Obamacare live. Trump wanted remove tax mandate. China around 80,000 cases went back normal. think China population 80,000?

That's ridiculous lol fitted, better surgical masks. 
 
I see countless people beards wearing N95 likely worse off. N95 higher resistance air flow. Leaks provide path least resistance. 
 
Surgical masks intended seal. easier breath may leaks, larger portion air goes media. course assules person wearing correctly relatively new. depends though.Where live Las Vegas,n.v. use one times close lived,in fact pretty far way.At food bank particular,it requirement proof address,valid identification &amp; piece mail verifying residency dated last 30 days.It first time visiting one &amp; prior experience rules were,but called advance &amp; gave asked &amp; able get goods.What made question system finishing paperwork get in,there family four sitting waiting area,the mom came one receptionists &amp; told needed food homeless &amp; hungry.This receptionist said I'm sorry,but unless proof residency theres nothing do.That's realized system helping disadvantaged severely broken,I can't say certain food banks city operate regulations overhearing conversation broke heart bit day.They turned family four away food homeless &amp; provide address,let sink in.Horrible. thats exactly want. like poor people, need slaves enough chores rest die.

O_o sub doom gloom. go far call best news ever, positive development, sure. Roeder said teacher classroom several months. Des Moines schools shut March planning begin school year next week virtual learning. Thats demonstrates effectiveness. weave mask catches moisture particle virus needs distribute help prevent spread. They‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs shortage again, we‚Äôve seen don‚Äôt understand why

There's reason why, would lot less scared people, confused people, discrimination.

The government *not* want less things, anything, want them. Teachers irreplaceable healthcare workers. They're essential workers forced be, many circumstances, close proximity children are, purely maturity standpoint, incapable maintaining basic hygiene, let alone social distancing proper mask wearing. 

Not mention many teachers are, simply age, high risk dying disease. lead blanket willful ignorance DHS saying completely appropriate, safety standpoint. 

And ample time N95 masks proper production capacity; hell, local head shop sells them. Imagine reading article lmao Boo. even politically charged offensive anyone. Guess can't mention leaders' names calling shots handle virus? Sounds relevant me, would know. mention policy, ideology political stances. mean logic fact DHS mentioned would mean post political. sure thats works... Whatever dawg.

Better smooth glass brain I‚Äôm NorCal air quality horrible due smoke.

Dude, he's playing FOOTBALL. know, sport masks, distancing, pile men laying top breathing heavy every couple minutes. said wears mask required. tell anyone else wear mask. weird people ok NFL without bubble, ok guy saying personally worried it. bet NFL players worried about. said it. happens media overhypes COVID supervirus even worse people need calm experts even saying huge threat anymore.

Source? switched target ‚Äúper capita‚Äù played along. Hawaii isn‚Äôt top ten unless look per capita.

But aren‚Äôt arguing good faith already knew that. solely question right protest, id full agreement you. that's case moment. 

You're America, know exactly dangerous caronavirus is. don't, google amount fatalities country far.

We refuse let document hundreds years old dictate actions eclipses logical reasonable thought, scientific fact. makes sense. It‚Äôs airborne classroom environment it‚Äôs selfish there‚Äôs still shortages medical staff. Literally one said anything anti-vax. clue pulled from. look you. guess disproves everything! Except not.

I really interested feel using small sample size specific age range testing pool allowing positive symptoms family members kids (family members original test pool, mind you) humongous glaring issue study.

But course understand huge issue study pretty much negates findings actually arguing it. arguing argument. That's responded ""that disproves everything! except not."" actual explanation statistician might point enough samples study generalize wider population, would valid point. grasping straws dismiss idea makes uncomfortable.

That's literally exactly I'm saying. crazy small sample size can't used extrapolate results wide population. people study even say so. nothing makes uncomfortable. want talk strawman arguments keep bringing things nothing anything mentioned like anti-vaxxers comfort level science. Yeah probably worried contracting it, he's not. make asshole worried contracting still taking account people's worries wearing mask/social distancing sake others? He's literally taking account people's thoughts feelings could ask for? Sure, could said care anything reporter asked question, seek attention it.

edit: take back another moment thought, exactly ""should"" worried contracting it? Maybe worried spreading it, say he's worried spreading even he's still taking account others thoughts following guidelines. lot difference wanting caring. FYI talking Department Homeland Security you, person responded to.

I edit post, haven‚Äôt looked post history.

Although fwiw, ideologues often argue mutually exclusive things, like said, wasn‚Äôt talking you.

Lockdown ‚Äúskeptics‚Äù deniers indeed argue everyone get it‚Äôs big deal. lead example then. kick curb. government agency.

Yeah, private drug companies good safety record without FDA oversight. would never fast track something sure profit! like would never lie addictive qualities opiates sell drugs set one worst drug use epidemics US ever seen make quick buck. Months ago. told they're meant 8-10 hours lol that's normal surgical masks exists I'm anti-mask person guysüòÇ comments give impression? None early top comments give impression expect vaccine widely available day 1. multiple effective vaccines soon

Is early-summer-soon, mid summer-soon, september-soon, late-autumn, soon-to-be early-2021 soon?   Poor sleep directly correlated cardiac events. bad news. read study said although measures helped, main reason covid cases dropped areas protests net effect causing people area stay home socializing

Which makes sense. protests happen downtown, karen trump friends arnt going want go hang bar

Just proof distancing works virus contagious wouldn‚Äôt argue ‚Äúgoal‚Äù endanger others. seems like goal simply protest oppresive rule, every developed country allow local costco. also said everything would control fall.

Speaking elementary school teacher: this, exactly. lot people see us dumping ground kids work hours, kind bleeds areas expecting us childcare jobs--like, instead expecting us teach school usually expected teach, teach bunch untestable life skills well.

And I'm even talking socialization skills--that's always part it, although definitely getting extreme (used be: teaching kids share, is: teaching kids throwing desks they're asked open book appropriate response). I'm talking about, like...kindergarteners first-graders toilet-trained parents think that's school's job now. Yes. think even hired Anders Tegnell back days.

Kushner alone looking 20+ years misappropriating funding causing spread COVID. Awesome thanks. he? get covid die pneumonia, counted 94%. 

Like honestly know people die covid without pneumonia blood clots heart palpitations. Nah you‚Äôre gonna get agree someone doesn‚Äôt deserve vaccine drugs Tegnells mentor pretty much advised beginning entire Swedish strategy. Read fucking article. Man, much mixed messaging. beginning this, surgeon general went Twitter said unnecessary irresponsible people wear masks! way. could understand providing/requiring surgical masks banning kinds masks fear use inferior masks, thus accidentially formally also banning better N95 masks.

In principle could also understand ban N95 masks outside medical field short supply medical frontline workers. think situation more. might case early months pandemic, remember masks made mandatory shopping end April besides surgical masks also FFP2 (similar N95) masks available pharmacies. nowadays ordered online.

But knowlingly banning basically best masks available even voluntary basis something cannot understand. unneccessarily increases risk teachers students. wonder motives are. current lack effective vaccine prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one effective ways prevent illness social distancing. time, sizeable portion public fails see necessity measures. identify one root cause this: People mistakenly perceive coronavirus grow linear manner, underestimating actual potential exponential growth. show correcting perceptual error significantly increases support social distancing. research shows importance statistical literacy among general public increasing support fight coronavirus using effective method currently available. also needs full testing company gives money Trump's reelection campaign. Essentially click bait-y title get people read Governor wants observe pandemic guidelines Labor Day weekend things still bad Mississippi. child age 5 died. 

‚Äú‚ÄúEven young, healthy people die [the virus],‚Äù Dobbs said.‚Äù live California. can't tell many times seen couples father daughter walking around woman wears mask. made pretty clear understand thinks masks bullshit you‚Äôre changing story completely.

Welcome ignore, can‚Äôt imagine I‚Äôd want opinions future anyway. Yeah, e.g. Arizona deciding reopen to... spite New Yorkers? worked well! never learned, it‚Äôs possible get twice, rarely happens. unhinged politicization virus.

Basically Trump's fault. denial, tried talk way pandemic, acolytes pretend derangement ""one side debate."" ARDS additionally shitty happen quickly treatment mostly completely supportive therapy, curative. Crap never thought would become antivaxer point yeah that's exactly feel there's even perception rushed they're going god damn hard time getting people board it.  he's faking guy biologies..... (or maths...). Crematory Operator here. 

For tests performed, decedents held Medical Examiner. can't perform test fast enough, days turn weeks progress made funeral/cremation decedent. 

This creates backlog workers death industry wait jobs. Bodies start come in, permits need submitted, take days weeks. 

Coolers finite amount space, court ordered longer hold bodies testing, funeral homes overwhelmed waiting paperwork clear space bodies. 50 million doses vaccine 25 million people. need 2 shots lot trolls shills there. Plus, I'm bad catching sarcasm text-based medium. N95 standard used US, KN95 standard used China. main difference KN95 masks don‚Äôt good seal N95 ones, air leaks unfiltered. vaccines pass trials goes another 12 months????? Welcome northeast.... Like 4. Months ago. still reuse n95s happens kid gets sent home school sick? Would count excused unexcused? Please tell you‚Äôre joking. support brutalizing BLM protests? think worth noting he's Swedish. perhaps vested interest advocating Swedish Strategy.

And (elsewhere) present seemingly compelling comparison Sweden's mortality versus countries, like US.

But question always advocates Swedish Strategy is: well, Finland Norway? Directly neighboring countries went conservative lockdown strategy, *far* better Sweden every measure.

But suppose we'll see turns out. Perhaps Sweden largely achieved herd immunity Stockholm, months they'll smooth sailing Finland Norway's cases deaths keep climbing. *maybe* we'll vaccine months 5,000+ Swedes unnecessarily died callous flawed strategy. can‚Äôt that! also define communism early USSR?

Fascism concept authoritarian order. fact Nazis couldn‚Äôt pull doesn‚Äôt change that. might argument fascism, though certainly don‚Äôt need those, doesn‚Äôt change definition. think spot on. High end PPE requires training use properly. school won‚Äôt training them, shouldn‚Äôt wear masks. 

I wonder efficiency N95 user isn‚Äôt properly fitted / trained. compares cloth masks. 

I doubt school would really enforce this. something paper cover liability lawsuit teacher wore N95 still got sick. 

My initial guess banning use N95s exhausts flaps designed dust, protect wearer. causing supply issues medical workers. neither seem case PDF starts trump speech making Mexico build wall, points countries restrict us travel due covid.

I know whether laugh cry saw it. Scrub / rub / mark NIOSH label N95 mask anymore...

Just tell anyone inquires modified, uncertified, nuisance particulate mask. prioritizing short term economy reelection prospects human life, caused thousands thousands needless deaths, also tanked long-term economy reelection prospects grow dimmer day. Talk lose-lose.

He mad bully viral infection first. one strategy, bluster complain, work time. lie say respect man make view actions statements positively would view another person. That's logical position take -- emotional one, fully acknowledge that.

But think unreasonable look someone think done lot good world field I'll going into, think Anthony Fauci absolutely falls category.

And concerned I'm one doom sayers hangs onto (and misrepresents) every word declare plague upon us everyone gets virus, even mild cases, going suffer (unspecified, unsupported data) ""LoNg TeRm DaMaGe""... feel free go comment history. I'm confident find hate apocalypse enthusiasts much anyone. still happening. New York double excess death count national average. rising, falling. herd immunity achieved vaccination well infection. delaying inevitable adequate vaccines keeps people dying. family intend keep wearing masks, social distance, semi-isolate vaccines prevalent. 

This mean hunkering one room spraying lysol every 15 minutes every surface. mean go gym go eat. mean frequent bars large gatherings go someone else's house party hearty. POTUS also leader death cult, caution resonating. Why? literally empirical question whether unnecessary not. He's WEARING masks. I've seen videos mask last several weeks. also says video wearing mask. Two things happen. states opinion something asked, even tries avoid controversy saying one stupid, also wears mask. one things makes selfish asshole? first, why? point allowed come conclusions still taking account people's thoughts/feelings acting behalf? tired hearing Swedens strategy heard immunity. not. Sweden thought could achive thing countries without forcing punishing people. Sweden sort lockdown used carrots instead sticks (Like extra money stay home work symtoms etc) .

I think dangerous myth. Right Sweden fairly well, deaths 1 2 per day. Meanwhile lot countries Europe seeing cases second wave. time lot countries forced lockdowns deaths per capita. 

That means Sweden used push heard immunity strategy restrictions. course dangerous. 

If someone source anyone responsible Swedish strategy confirms pushing heard immunity please post it. Hell's Accountants. actually idea. Turns ""reopen economy"" demagoguery. we're stuck worst worlds. Imagine much money guy wasted? Ya know lie numbers right??? nothing draconian protecting innocent people around death lifelong suffering due permanent organ damage.

The draconian thing would allow virus spread. Hey now! Red hats read think downvotes recent research clearly demonstrates masks benefit wearer *and* others. use claims filtration air leakage coming scrutiny recently, may perform well advertised forgot /s leant on, it? Well leftist elites let cut social security medicare, take matters hands. I‚Äôm gonna keep repeating keep asking fucking questions dude. talking semester? that‚Äôs you: don‚Äôt want product, don‚Äôt buy product. understand least argument spring it‚Äôs bad one; students sue don‚Äôt like professor now? professor dies mid semester replaced? million things happen? Still vaccinating til normal protocol/trials run. confusing CFR IFR. Actual death rate per CDC currently 0.68% (and likely drop) Doctors while, actually. Sometimes one one N95. I‚Äôm talking vaccine trial phases. saying beginning saying wouldn‚Äôt shortcuts.

I said shortcut vaccine trials might actually good idea given alternative obviously unsafe well. wished could frank it, wouldn‚Äôt look sketchy later, does.

But also can‚Äôt guarantee won‚Äôt undue influence. end judgement call based complete information. problem that. world moves forward time without you, decisions need made incomplete information timely effective, Fauci isn‚Äôt position guarantee won‚Äôt undue influence. would credible admitted that. almost humans social beings ones exhalation vents. different designs vents. Article April. post OP? Drama baiting karma? is, hell they've already done convalescent therapy-

This fair comparison. bar vaccine EUA different therapeutic concerned it-

He said give EUA without data. say FDA considering so.  don‚Äôt go near protest laugh, know silly sounds. know cold flu spreads winter cooped inside, yet advise got health ""experts"" slow corona down. seems advise gotten non-sense. confirmed leaders get hair cut despite shutting salons. think know keep spreading virus, would stop spread covid panic. Seems real political. really dont think deaths happened anything it? think one point maybe good thing doom gloomers insist leaving homes coming while. stay homes permanently lmao. grim future, last survivors humanity sends robot back time, goal, break Smash Mouth. I'd take without hesitation shit sherlock? 

Please provide enlightenment said would. mean rich dentists, bikers. New Zealand real shortage teachers, maybe use opportunity pinch country give fuck them. cover less half US population ends two dose vaccine. 

From Moderna production numbers cited, sounds like Warp Speed fail Moderna vaccine ends one works well. take risk? produce enough *every* promising vaccine?

The US government spent [$9 Covid vaccines month ago, $27 American. Let's order magnitude least. surplus exported even given away major humanitarian diplomatic benefits (remember rush Chinese masks ventilators?). Please, please, mind source. DHS say teachers shoudn't wear N95 masks, school District Whitefish Bay says this. DHS recommends cloth masks, says nothing N95s whether teachers wearing them.

This whole article bunk. Here's DHS say schools, bottom page six instructions masks: rub recommends cloth masks. mention N95s all. Fox article referring specifically Whitefish Bay school district may forbidding use N95s, conflating absence recommendation N95 suggest Evers DHS pushing bunk science stating teachers wear N95s.

It's worth mentioning State Supreme Court Wisconsin (heavily Conservative) pushing really hard strip emergency mandates Governor Evers (Democrat) pushed, defund DHS, remove woman presently charge it. Fox, know, pushes Conservative ideologies; another way twisting two unrelated stories throw shade governor. absolutely thought SOMEONE care. mean anything malicious political. process moving stuff cause errors happen due sheer number. find results surprising-- depressing. 

Note cited estimate 1% population considered ""anti-social personality disorder""; percentage tendencies would course larger percentage meeting DSM-5 criteria.  ~75% phase 3 vaccines get approved.

The vast majority vaccines fail phase 1. kind drivel sub upvotes.

You selectively evolve natural vaccine. right. See first post. probably call patients let know, then. Good news bad news here. improbable spread disease wearing mask social distancing. went crowded event social distanced wore mask afterwards, probably going infect anyone outside event. affect really business risks someone takes.

The Tour De France taking place pandemic France. cycling team isolated safety bubble, plans (not if) someone team tests positive. process entering bubble, leaving bubble. performing constant testing.

In short *can* plan. rely holding breath.

New Jersey's excess mortality 136%. Perhaps outbreak occurred July knowledge still allowed COVID patients nursing homes, excess mortality rate would 115%, 120%, 125% (i.e., still national average). **But point national average would still lower right now.**

We, not. institution get researchers funding, that's kind institution lol bad paper. method **counting** flawed, issue finding drop size, address paper. real issue assuming correlation droplet count expelled speech relative ability spread COVID, paper claim. Many people already pointed out; speculating perhaps even let droplets might issue drop size small enough evaporate air.

If anything, lay person probably take mean avoid speaking wearing mask (unless distanced) possible. Things like proper fit minimizing contact time (for can) important. using two-layer fleece gaiter single-folded bandana, strongly consider switching another mask, since indication might sufficient. single-fold bandana already identified likely insufficient spring. recommendation [fold several probably unnecessary people since lot cheap good masks available stores. suppose could argue extra cleaning airplanes response corona helps. would hope airlines continue frequent cleanings virus runs course. certainly enjoyed saving money gas getting sleep more, miss pandemic over. Probably logical argument isn‚Äôt based around absolutely decimating economic social aspects society like everything else people.. matter effects them. True. Even sitting ready, distribution small thing. wide availability flu vaccines years US, takes 4 months everyone wants one get vaccinated. two doses time though, people require two doses time - did, would called one dose. 300mm doses 300mm people january manufacturing continues second dose couple months later. I'm people required wear masks stores. lot go around noses. Gold-plated syringes I'll get vaccine Trump Fauci get national television. fact, lets give every member Congress too, I'll faith vaccines. far I'm aware Mustangs *are* cheap muscle car brand. ‚ÄúFrom‚Äù noticing one havent dealt first one. 


Countries mandated masks maybe seeing small resurgence still better either mandated lax upholding law. EXTREMELY SUSCEPTIBLE MAN DIES get Link please words ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù lmao post r/conspiracy. worth talking to. name countries took seriously? I‚Äôve seen, almost countries seen resurgence cases unless completely shut boarders continue harsh lockdowns would decimate economy. ""We're New York City."" mean 3 months? would make February. Baby Boom 2: Electric Boogaloo sure go lot protests seen violence first hand media, telling everyone else reliable way. 

I‚Äôm assuming one folks riot gear protests - since you‚Äôre regular attender supporter BLM.  want stop virus spreading everyone, almost everyone needs get it.

Herd immunity requires mass infection, result even deaths. nonsense talk coming folks want frame death destruction positively election. fake then. Add filters masks allowed wear. First all, matter happens, vaccines rolled long Phase 3 trials complete. Phase 3 trials supposed continue least 2 years, willing wait long, guest.

Second all, vaccine greenlighted early EUA regular approval, FDA still analyzing Phase 3 data regardless. may easily enough people enrolled trials prove efficacy soon. Concerning ü§î thought day too! make things missed difficult time I'm teacher. Today school delayed start on-campus learning late October. I'm happy boss fucking moron conspiracy theorist risking life. One us rejecting expert consensus iffy evidence. comparing peaks noisy graph doesn‚Äôt mean much. 68 vs 65 first responded to.
just saying strawman doesn‚Äôt prove shit either.
Given use intentionally misleading data sloppily, data provide pretty much equal. Thanks this. Also, despite getting placebo it‚Äôs part process. You‚Äôre looking get vaccinated trial, you‚Äôre helping everyone get vaccinated proving works. I‚Äôd nervous/excited well. Thanks! dumb shit again? fucking morons. Bikers fucking stupid. That's gave post award. No, straManning though jesus christ. needed virus. long go for? Blaming individual potentially causing someone get sick? point put responsibility person putting position getting sick. you‚Äôre following guidelines, distancing masks whatnot, chance infected pretty dam low ofcourse case anomalies. There‚Äôs studies showing whole wards covid nurses testing negative face shields introduced.

Here UK, point current levels absolutely restrictions eased terms masks distancing / gatherings. What‚Äôs driving force behind policies? severity doesn‚Äôt match policies ton ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù brought table. We‚Äôre longer judging pandemic hospitalisations deaths, ‚Äúcases‚Äù. could asymptomatic.. they‚Äôre driven behavioural science, health science. 

The goalposts forever changing, point deem covid none-risk factor longer need measures, hit absolute zero? made clear public, seemingly ever changing. lol... point heard many different things think guessing. county never got overwhelmed even peak here. 3k hospitalizations today it‚Äôs trending down. Highway Hell, Dirty deeds done dirt cheap! I've saying months. going announce miracle vaccine treatment right election. Neither work, known election over.

You're likely get dosed safe effective vaccine next year.  almost like police around all, one would ever breaking law? Fascinating.

You experienced this, fair enough. really hope personally saw act violence first hand delayed response someone crowd yelled. experience, protests around area, peaceful. 2 weren't, absolutely started law enforcement. 

Yet media said otherwise. Since then, believe anything. people protesting wrong, officer happen know paid price judge want rule mob. hate protests, fight forever. people horrible, disgusting monsters. think one wife one husband aware stats entire nation?

Why would they?

There 800,000 police officers US. 

So yes, would expect agencies responsible reporting would reliable source families. Right on, tell.

There‚Äôs lot money made campaign donations had.

CDC states 60,000-80,000 died influenza time frame mentioned, one worst flu seasons record. Keep trying minimize severity COVID, though. numbers based written death certificate. 6% didnt(for example) time autopsy wrote covid moved next dead body. Subordinating interests not.

nice straw man built Imagine dad died telling somebody it, say, ""big whoop, one guy"". Interesting. idea often happens China, access stats? areas care least gonna hit hardest. complicated that, that's rule thumb.

Course good empathy even evil.  bad. Still means there's 320% increase compared two months back. guess ""only"" 68% growth totally fine, Denmark's totally improving. /s Exactly, sub full twats. Airborn = 10 meters little less half It‚Äôs like administration *trying* cause much death possible. Trump, bringer plagues natural progression/spread. Seems started coasts, spread across entire southern tier US, working central interior.... School since industrialization. Something something creation universe made many people angry Well, listen reason, confuse further. decided matter says anything fit weird little antisocial narrative, must wrong thinking critically.

Yep. got monopoly enlightened political analysis. Congratulations. who's fault that? picnic happen yet? hope so. hard enough watching sidelines, can‚Äôt even imagine horrible scientists public health officials know going know could helped save many lives, president/administration didn‚Äôt care. Get antibody test. They're cheap easy We're fucking yet us still give shit enough discuss employers economic system forcing heart damage us. also told masks weren‚Äôt necessary. CDC tracks excess deaths possible compare. florida passed NY (not counting NYC) soon pass NYC own. combining two close yet. 

one thing remember though CDC admits 2-8 weeks behind, florida drops back single digit covid deaths wait month great idea one deaths.

my suspicion going NY since hit first. hard worse whoever flying blind, desdantis damn sure trying. Canada reporting here, Ontario. Current turn around 48 hours no, 24 hours less yes. 24 hours yes, 6 days no. Hubby got test one work recently.

My area tests reason, even need single symptom. think we're 400 tests day well (fewer people needing testing). too. many wear both, figure kno me, people get face. Equating collected data expert analysis said data guess disingenuous best. 

Nobody give credence personal anecdote told person online. I‚Äôm obviously skeptical said story clear reasons. 

Anyways, need stop procrastinating finishing work, good day. It‚Äôs difference reporting. death certificates say cause death Covid-19 without giving info. death certificates might say Covid + pneumonia.

It‚Äôs difference saying someone died form Covid-19 saying someone died pneumonia got Covid-19. Yes. Everything mess design (state federal-- local, district amazing much). small 1:1 school teachers phD, special ed. blend virtual 1:1 in-person 1:1. I'm huge pubic school fan ADHD/Autistic kid can't handle right now... neither we, sadly. Let selfish batards pay price then. want bubble? I'm ready see pop know. know. Bad shit happen rushed vaccines. 

But please let work quickly. all. Oh right, forgot month. increased 320% since two months back ""only"" increased 68% since two months back, dropping peak 168 August 16th. guess that's one would expect controlled burn strategy. I'm surprised would even release numbers looked like that. I'm also surprised still numbers state google chart state progress. state banned travel alaska went looked deaths bouncing 0 1 2 deaths weeks. went 4 lifted ban. deaths still 0. Right? I'm you. Anyone paying attention known since like February There's way people dumb. seeing shit play months have. somehow came conclusions? drugs taking? Well yes world war 2 happen whole ""both sides"" trope played demonstrably false. *obvious* republicans *far* worse Democrats. Dems local state elections often good people. weird people hang pointless centrism. Here's thing though, they're cutting corners. 

Before like this: scientists vaccine mind, requested money, waited paperwork go through. world COVID priority #1. Scientists request money, they've given blank check. wait paperwork go through, there's bureaucracy involved urgent matter. 

You would amazed fact they're still phase 1, 2, 3 along regular safety checks. priority #1.  That‚Äôs problem...they‚Äôve trained people work ‚Äúthrough‚Äù health issues...all name greed. wonder people get soooooo freaking sick....we push people illness.....ridiculous America 190,000 cases. 190,000 deaths. Well said, thanks. agree Kids transmitting *less* transmitting all. They've relatively isolated months, meet others, probably mostly outdoors. 

So 3 55 transmission chains index case identified might meaningful. Maybe is, maybe not. We'll see. aware brand new coronavirus, thank you. disagree you. Believe not, I'm trying convince agree me. live life letting articles like scare shit because, accounts, COVID stay. 

Sometimes, cure worse disease. concerned unknown long-term health effects, I'd assume rushing get vaccine becomes available. mean, without decades study, trust cause horrific side effects 5-10 years time? H1N1 example, problematic people issue lining get shot. generally double-mask used valved mask - put surgical mask top it. Still reusing masks? That's pretty embarrassing... They're spreading much coronavirus . . . clearly remember pulled class elementary school told mother jail truancy would released soon could come pick (I legit sick lot child). Texas eff around absences. get parents send sick kids in. deaths per capita, several countries higher numbers (UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, etc). Pneumonia Deaths 2 5 times. Oops. Feel same. Bad enough got health concerns. covid worry about? give man....Im tired worrying. bet you‚Äôd lived whatever country hardest hit would care. That's he's moving Texas. Sounds like he'll fit right in. energy last year 60k people died flu? You‚Äôre virtue signaling joke. killed grandma cuz went outside without mask. sheep. Still shillin rubles? Southern Hemisphere anything go by, flu least anyone's worry seasonal change. social distancing near non existent. However, spread COVID potential increase dramatically. Southern Hemisphere hell, even harsh lockdowns Argentina, South Africa Chile. 

I split data seasonal areas Northern Southern Hemispheres tropics see overall patterns. quite clear hit populations year round, spread significantly worse cooler months. Southern Hemisphere winter diabolical. Northern Hemisphere lucky hit warming months.

[Deaths Covid Hemisphere Troll accounts gonna troll. happened/is happening Manaus real though. question happened. know, barely election 2018 Trump loses, beatable. Ha Ha truly harrowing scary true covid damages heart, damage also affect kinds heart related concerns like exercize people sufffer panic attacks ( like me)....This shit news hear, man..... kids get covid? come school already infected? crazy situation. everything shut March. Everyone spoke watched kid like Hawk, super protective. get cause people took care make sure come contact anyone. school open, time get kids school. safe, it? Like title said 9 kids, 1st day school Covid. someone family transferred kid. else contact school? Teachers, Custodians, Para Professionals? I'm really sorry happened. Real quick, long kids play video games? 1, 2, 3 hrs day? 4hrs online learning. 
I know!!! Big brain energy. Can't get std get tested!! Cases rising steadily, unfortunately. Let's hope hospitalizations continue decline bc tell us lot severity virus continues mutate. 132% people died would alive today? knew dumb, man exceeded expectations. kill us, make us stronger /s -agreed, one question, incarcerated 2nd line? Shouldn‚Äôt last? good explanation difference signs symptoms, hope people become aware important distinction. got virus, got riots, got joblessness homelessness....

amd also got election coming up.

This year fucked thought normal etiquette United Capitalist States America! F. seen live biggest city state. So... beloved pub closed pandemic. Well, recently learned they're new ownership today noticed plastered anti-mask propaganda front entrance. I'm already furious favorite hangout close, good friends owners too. Seeing propaganda rubbing salt wound me, I'm afraid owner's callousness potentially leading spike cases live. way report deter noncompliance? I'd wear mask... mask. Go Tigers deaths lag infections 2-4 months, ill don‚Äôt die immediately ICU hospital.  

At one point death rate 1%.  US states death rate went 2% 3%, hospitalised patients finally succumbed time. Reported deaths. fuckers would lie even truth better story. Isn‚Äôt Fucked ‚Äú incarcerated‚Äù b vaccinated children young adults passed class A!

That say got F, Trumplemathics means A. intentional misinformation campaign nbd Let tell you, panic attack, blood pressure spikes start feeling like youre gonna die? wont ever look anxiety attacks way again....

I used think nothing, hell no.....It feels like gonna die right there....its awful..... Well, I‚Äôd fucked. born heart defect compromised immune system. I‚Äôve everything keep safe, I‚Äôd need take risk actually got job. I‚Äôve unemployed since March. also study filtration efficiency per particle size given velocities thru paper. like framed matter national security, seriously is. would like see data/analysis claim- doubting genuinely interested. first one happened, brother trying tell big deal. told him, ""Only papers"".

It change anything politically. Lol bet smart kids stuck person schedule purposefully show without mask get booted remote program. Yet good public-health practice doesn‚Äôt require control. also requires transparency, public trust, collaboration‚Äîhabits mind allow free societies better respond pandemics. Democracies‚Äô ability cope COVID-19 soon tested; proliferation cases South Korea, Japan, Italy recent days, officials weighing respond. citizens democratic nations reasonably expect higher level candor accountability **American citizens, example, count objectivity accuracy U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention, whose weekly morbidity mortality report fixture critical communication government public** one form another since late 1800s. Reliable reporting enables epidemiologists predict disease‚Äôs trajectory, researchers develop treatments vaccines, responders trace transmission, public protect itself. massive panic attack induced asthma/copd....Blood pressure high even benzodiazepams brought down....Started feeling chest pains.

Rather become one die home, said screw risked catching Covid headed ER myself.

I mean, considering suffering matter? 

So walk, first security checkpoint contraband weapons. Wow.

I go in, pretty quiet actually.

I stay 4 hours leave nothing wrong, say. couldnt explain it. say though catching virus ER low based protocols....

So go home im nonplussed maybe caught covid. maybe not....

Whatever man.....at least wore facemask? Please explain United Kingdom outpacing United States developing vaccine then.  2 issues: 

Visitors wearing ppe correctly putting staff/pts risk. 

Many facilities still rationing ppe supply visitors Plus, live villages year round tend elderly. villages likely also nearly enough medical resources cope severe outbreak. China takes blame time merely identifying rather elusive outbreak could around long before, standard conduct every country hide novel outbreak long possible accuse first country fails origin. surprised? get hopes up. state feels red times Noem idolized much Trump. good scientists labs stuff. worth weight they'd come america started. yep, people seem worry flu-like symptoms covid - guess that's government media. people realise many cases people's bodies completely shut down; recover, still feel side effects heart murmurs

scary Lemme guess. Expires November? 3 point every legit comment downvoted pro-ccp trolls  went Mexico last week lol  good news though? news welcome provide evidence it. fire department failed stop fire. Better disband fire department! cameup Covid positive beginning July. Luckily pretty much symptoms besides lost taste &amp; smell.. mightve runny nose couple days. 

For past month Ive noticed major brain fog, almost like feeling lack sleep even get good nights sleep. also feel would describe mild crackling crunching head especially start go sleep. painful almost feela good like releasing pressure brain. 

Ive also mild achiness chest.

Knowing Covid 2 months ago kind assumption lot post covid inflammation. 

What kind tests get done? Also recommendations treating inflammation? Glad trillion-dollar companies almost least could do. already track every movement make, give new checkbox. What's misunderstanding? Everything said correct. mean y‚Äôall consistently getting tested even symptoms? Cause I‚Äôm guilty going get tested Florida testing 20-25 k per day now, last month 70k+ per day.  live SD wish would leave. selfish literally option. mother stayed home work sick young home alone would homeless. parents CAN'T miss work. mother appendix burst knew waited go hospital miss work, could recover day off. remember terrified mom looked like almost dead neighbor watch weekend. took mom nearly 20 years pay one medical bill off. pushed terrifying extremes make sure home food. would prove population killed covid likely die significantly sooner without Covid-19 overall population. done I‚Äôm sure data even exists.

You didn‚Äôt give new numbers it‚Äôs two people talking. didn‚Äôt prove killed Covid-19 less healthy average person, let‚Äôs consider it. 

Perhaps part population chronic diseases would contribute deaths, many others would receive treatment continue live them. So, life expectancy 8.6 instead 9.4 years - statistically significant drop doesn‚Äôt really undercut point. I'm surprised well comment doing! Usually get downvoted oblivion. completely true, media sells fear. I'd like get get dry facts risks numbers. There's two sides somewhat relate. undergrad needs state financed. However thing many cut mentally school. We've set artifical requirements degree none necessary. secretary require masters. don't. financially best intentions congress gave loans people filter (not trust gov get right) colleges saw continual free money keeps getting dumped business types who've infested dean provost roles academic credentials simultaneously cutting tenure track favor adjunct prof's pennies dollar. Look adjunct hell.  


At grad level:

Science engineering generally okay self limiting. one unless funded good enough get funded sent home masters. make fail quals fail research grade. overall problems academic system lack jobs phd's upon graduation cuts tenure track slots. Related separate cause.  


Medicine slowest change. cry shortage there's aire of; well 100 hour weeks residency fair to. (fun facts 1 people awake 48 hours equivalent drunk 2 ask they're resident long they've shift refuse care unless attending supervises provides it, walk nurse introduces Dr n so. I'm like NEAT year you? long up? Boom know what's coming really breaks ice :) )  Anyway Sure try make everyone top performer medical system accept humans fall bell curve. Set residence reasonable like military (one things go right) add specialty fellowships show promise function higher tiers.  yes realize may knowledgeable 100 hr weeks, figure accept one wants physician.   


Personally think medical training pipeline insane. take bio chem pre requites, art history major, well MCATS get in. Nuts  can't get M.S. Ph.D. engineering unless graduated B.S. engineering accredited school, NP's nursing practicing. cram practical stuff throat residency years experience condensed painful. hey scientists know... keep eating young complain one wants enter profession. Wow deep drinking trump kool aid complete bullshit. CDC's numbers indicate deaths *involving* covid-19. Saying people would alive disingenuous af.

I personally know two people ""died covid-19"". One friend's father also end stage cancer patient, friend motorcycle wreck. Call crazy, claiming ""covid killed them"" kinda...fucking stupid.

It's complete madness fauci make claim. theory Ronald don‚Äôt give fuck Florida voters trump going give high ranking federal job. Wasn‚Äôt military? Hmm. Yeah stupid. Landlords financial obligations too. accommodate adjust everyone affected delinquent payments. right, antibody test detect early, better use see it. literally one two types covid tests reopening plan includes closing campus 10% students/staff test positive

That‚Äôs insane. That‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúoh shut US get 33 million confirmed cases‚Äù Kicks elections, presumably done CA. years ago invested rental property, I‚Äôve tenant 7 years, never raised rent. 

They late rent many times years, we‚Äôve pretty cool it. 

Their money comes disability SS, job loss. haven‚Äôt paid rent since April. 

I bank loan like probably 90% landlords. Can‚Äôt evict them, can‚Äôt even sell property. 

So me, wife kids get cover housing costs least 8 months. Oh yeah, tough time employed too.

Pretty F‚Äôd deal. Mass refusal take vaccine people refuse wear masks next step. say they're skeptical corporations watch corporate news, consume nothing propaganda made rich. mindset, there's good guys bad guys, bad guys childish cartoons wish destroy world nefarious reasons. medical experts liars exagerating deaths vague reasons. Please show instances. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs stuff like shat idea would somehow quarantine New York. 

It‚Äôs fault guy doesn‚Äôt know actual powers are, can‚Äôt seem hire people tell him. 

It‚Äôs shocking someone would want guy charge crisis. He‚Äôs failed. Everybody noticed. Except you, guess. You‚Äôre lying him. analogy nonsense

Nah, understand, thing continue wrong.

No u ""long term"" since covid came know literally quoted statistician Cambridge university. techs still directly handle bottles packaging/paperwork well insurance cards give back customer. Unfortunately, days 30% people see masks noses. Including several kids morning school teach district. Unfortunately, days 30% people see masks noses. Including several kids morning school teach district. someone get paywall? Unfortunately, days 30% people see masks noses. Including several kids morning school teach district. think hit nail head one. Now.... Onceler contributed redemtion terrible actions later life, he? wonder might play Darth Desantis.... mentioned situation like this. Elementary school nurse great nurse would happily let spend day resting needed. would bring school work nurse would help fall behind. small town stayed graduation class would 60 people that's including 20 homeschool kids least senior year normal school. Fucking homeschool kids always weird. New York Post? Seriously? think understand context find longer videos media sites: countries recording death caused COVID-19 patient comorbidity dies. US is. Contrary popular belief, mean someone dies car crash also tested positive COVID-19 going counted COVID death.

This observation consistent across major health experts organizations across US CDC. Even Dr. Birx saying think saying, would contradicted thousands health experts. all, would contradicted massive amount excess deaths 2020, especially since lockdowns one went work anything.

Sorry, counterargument hold water. going die anyway, die coronavirus,""

Comorbidity mean someone late stage cancer. mean someone cancer remission. mean someone merely obese diabetic, would normally live many decades longer. 

Also, could use logic cause death, they're COVID-19. could subtract died flu comorbidities get tiny number. one that. COVID-19? ask get answer. it‚Äôs sad really rolls back around towards capitalism. Creating ridiculous roles way nickel dime student much thus cutting middle man. ways keep people debt. I.e saying short cuts achieve top level medical training opposed standard way use many years ago. It‚Äôs money two ways look it. Meanwhile average lay person suffers result insanely high medical care overall point. 

And get feel person science field I‚Äôm sure disconcerting say least. Seeing field compartmentalise must mind boggling. 

I made point another post saw kind drive point home all. 

The system needs change completely starts greatly lowering tuition costs. opinion happen since socialise medicine never thing country.   Prisons hotbeds Coronavirus, prisoners, prison workers well. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Gonna lot harder getting heart transplant. mean length

Median, fuck‚Äôs sake least learn difference mean Fifty‚Äêthree percent died within 6 months placement. Sorry trying use logic solve real question. want anyone dying covid, friend. prepare prescriptions touch pills is, nothing pills would likely ingested. practical solution may spritz bottles disinfectant alcohol put blanket warning pill bottles. Taking man hours away Rx prep consequences well. It‚Äôs black white issue see it. Lmao, suspense killing me! COVID-19 forgot Phase 0: rich powerful. fucking way I‚Äôm trusting first US vaccine become available. gov‚Äôt corrupt trust. Every single aspect designed lowest bidder many corners cut may well circle.

I‚Äôm waiting minimum 6 months becomes available average person. CDC FDA become garbage. I‚Äôm stupid enough trust known liars sellouts. Right know trolling fuck off. finally got lot together life lot difficult years financial issues. lot look forward year, I'm jobless life upside virus. Sorry things feel particularly grim. difference March 6 solid months data, medical treatment, viral mutation (even subtle). 

Viruses nature evolution self select versions propagate existence. Kill host fast end line, moderate mutation spread host doesn‚Äôt even know it. virus killing rate March/April. mention spread mostly amongst people preexisting conditions people densely populated areas overwhelmed hospitals time. mess.

In addition never child killer - another feature Covid attacks weakest spent cells body, thus people complications die much higher rate, addition older people. Healthy kids aren‚Äôt dying (101 died 476k confirmed infections, many complications). 

The concern kids obviously spreads adults (teachers otherwise) something else know virus doesn‚Äôt well surfaces spreads mostly close contact aerosolized transfer. limit children go wear masks wash hands, mitigate chances getting it. home isolate anyone risk. isn‚Äôt possible home schooling virtual learning.

Lastly, know lot treatment options. Doctors finding ways stabilize patients, assuming aren‚Äôt major complications existed virus.

Oh would look that, even cherry-picked time interval, Denmark still worse Sweden. Funny, that.

Denmark's currently sitting 6 times number new cases per day lowest they've since peak, meaning Denmark's pretty terribly.

Sweden's currently sitting at... why, would look that! lowest ever been! last time checked, 1 less 6, - Denmark exceeding Sweden mile.

That's rely statistics, measured appropriately, meaningful scale. look weekly deaths, causes, 2020 big, big damn spike US. coronavirus. Sure. wear mask venture public spaces. don‚Äôt cower fear home don‚Äôt understand risk - don‚Äôt advocate policies incur damage society economy far excess risk.

But, time USA viewed land freedom opportunity.  Still one talking OD suicides quarantine... Inflation never seems problem billionaires corporations want (NOT need!) money time 40, truly blessed sort underlying pre-existing serious shit. 

The common ""underlying pre-existing serious shit"" Americans overweight. Fortunately, that's entirely preventable, even 40. Trying?  Florida went 2,000 cases yesterday 7,600 today. I'm disgusted, country heading backwards. team involves teamwork. wrong mindset.  Kind of. Death certificates always list secondary cause, although usually do. nuance bit difficult explain, one way think terms disease consequences disease, contributed cause death.

If die heart attack, ""Myocardial infarction"" may listed cause death, secondary contribution ""Diabetes"" ""Hypertension."" contributed cause death made heart attack worse. look COVID-19, often causes death respiratory failure, death certificate would read ""Respiratory Failure"" secondarily reference ""COVID-19"" vice versa, COVID-19 disease caused SARS-COV-2. 

It accurate say 6% people contributory conditions health problems would complicate disease (perhaps zero health conditions contribute death). good example ""osteoarthritis,"" disease process would make onto death certificate.  certainly stop healthy person dying.

Nope, that‚Äôs nice side effect, care try also needed. helpful nice have.

So words, stops dying, needed. Solid logic /s can't look ways wait virus pass... that‚Äôs life stop acting like everyone going live 300...the world way crowded need let nature it‚Äôs thing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è No. doesnt bud.

Nobody writes post says ‚ÄúOMG random person town Covid potentially risk long term health effects.‚Äù Thabk president, insisted testing slowed keep number down, ban I'm political exactly happened I'm sorry Rechecked CDC still accurate. numbers buried deep available .csv format don‚Äôt want public see bad really been.

100 years now... nearly everyone 2020 died!!! Vote Kunta Kinte! team could've called hoax? could've helped states procure PPE instead telling state they're own, causing scramble bid PPE. federal government also bid PPE making expensive unnecessarily. businessman could've purchased wholesale PPE negotiating fair price divvied state instead multiple governors contact businesses overseas waste money handled it. figured known supply/demand due experience well wholesale bargaining. Also certain hospitals PPE seized FEMA, that's worse nothing. said state own, also strongly suggested states reopen ""liberate"" comments. 

Here's flip side, beginning said great job. I'm trying figure exactly do? I'm trying keep open mind, far lots stuff I've seen point meddling inaction. I'm saying dead people would alive today him, certainly help numbers. Always go effort really precise, add things like complicated that, that's rule thumb.

People ignore though. Yeah, population density, amount citizen travel, etc., factor in. least testing first thing put others classes. Actually vehicle related fatalities increased span March-April. don‚Äôt know why, did. ‚Äúshit post‚Äù right, concede that.

They actually, reduce initial viral load, conflated risk developing serious symptoms LOL horseshit. push pull trying everything safely destroying social fabric are.

no good answer right.

yes, numbers down...but goddamit...schools petri dish. Oh yeah, that's totally fair. totally direct quote. wanna say /r/theydidthemath gotta sources stats Question, I'll admit I'm big science person - antibodies last 4 months, good vaccine? mean need booster every 4 months forever? (Sorry dumb question.) October Surprise evidence actual experts said possible, would good see. Every single expert, including Fauci, publicly said next impossible explicitly impossible. So, basically, unless experts say safe, would unlikely trust it. Even pro-Trump people said pre-Nov 3, knowledge.

The administration, currently, least trustworthy messengers. point that:

A) people listen scientists president scared pandemic, likely vote mail. makes trump‚Äôs attack mail voting effective.

B) elections soon, long term impact pandemic might effect elections much short term economics. words pretend everything fine people may vote take effective measures.

C) pandemic larger effect racial minorities (who likely vote democrat). effect doesn‚Äôt kill democratic voters higher rate, makes people community less likely go vote fear pandemic. Thats get shutting business that's truly essential allowing people work home expensive. Again, don‚Äôt disagree. There‚Äôs lot examples unions supporting trades, also don‚Äôt think anything inherently wrong old union structures, we‚Äôve seen 50 years eroding confidence them. Everything Hollywood stories corrupt unions idolization billionaire class helped paint unions darkly. belong fairly strong union IATSE, even anti union members union. know one guy cards four different locals whos support union breaking places like Tesla Amazon because, words, unions inherently corrupt. that‚Äôs dude finds work union resources!

I‚Äôm need stronger, diverse union type, first need figure way keep president America‚Äôs billionaires destroying unions already have. Things going get lot worse get better.

Distance learning working alright people. Safety measures scary intimidating factor suggesting implies situations student better dead frightened. said feels feel comfortable safe effective vaccine. distinctly different know safe effective vaccine, available. Feeling comfortable position almost every stage 3 trial in, else get there. Stage 3 trials fail regularly.

Fauci speaks precisely. heartened said this, I've already seen shared online ""we're getting vaccine end year"", which, short actual miracle, true vast majority us.

The headline exactly misleading, getting there. Well, even DHS. CDC buckling political pressure, sadly. born one aren't. become sociopath. can't understand saying Yeah. Russia, China Trump would benefit immensely giving unsafe vaccines peoples right?

You either take not. fact one others vouching make reliable.

Plus, leaders want proper vaccine. Fauci himself. disgusting common mentality *fucking healthcare facilities* someone worked medical ten years never understand shit people qualified allowed work them.

At least humble enough *correct* love glob Exactly. I'm wanting assaulted. Especially that. Ugh reason coronavirus successful - apart fact half cases may asymptomatic - it‚Äôs also good infecting us, spreads efficiently. that‚Äôs true since first recorded cases Wuhan. Alina Chan Broad Institute Shing Zhan University British Columbia analysed genetic sequences first samples collected, compared them. compared variation first SARS, spotted something odd. Phil Sansom asked SARS-2 much similar SARS-1 late phase epidemic. case SARS-1, first crossed animals humans could see virus underwent adaptation new host, humans. early phase epidemic; virus mutating, finding adaptive mutations could help transmit amongst humans. time hit late phase epidemic, genetic diversity greatly reduced. finding suggested time detected SARS-2 December 2019, already really optimised, highly adept human transmission. missing whole period SARS-2 rapidly adapting new host, raises really important questions SARS-2 come Shing, could please explain genetically means SARS-2 similar late version SARS-1, rather early one? genetic similarity mean Within roughly first three months outbreak, genome SARS-CoV-2 one fourth amount genetic diversity found SARS-CoV-1. genetic sequence data four samples Wuhan night seafood market, compared genome sequences recovered samples genome sequence Wuhan reference SARS-CoV-2; found they're similar. led us think was, maybe outbreak happening market start nonhuman intermediate host, instead could come people already infected time grocery shopping samples actually from? bits meat samples were, example, doorknobs; even samples sewers; samples surfaces garbage trucks. looked like us sequences similar humans. real evidence data virus came animal sold Alina, surprising Yeah, case SARS-1, went straight local market found numerous species animals carry SARS-1-like viruses. importantly SARS-1-like viruses hundred percent match, that's we're surprised here. SARS-2, look samples market, they're nearly virtually 100% identical human version. suggests viruses animals source virus, rather dropped humans infected visited case, actually come three different scenarios plausible. One is: SARS-2 would crossed animal humans long time ago - could months years - circulated undetected human population amount time, picking adaptive mutations along way, finally broke Wuhan reached state high adaptation human transmission. second scenario: SARS-2 already pre-adapted humans bats intermediate host. last scenario, controversial, SARS-2 could resulted lab-based scenarios. we're saying accuse anyone malicious intent; lab accidents happen frequently. Even first SARS escaped many world-class labs, multiple times. Sometimes lab accidents happen. Unfortunately, still misleading focuses heavily prevalence pre-existing conditions.

The 94% statistic combines pre-existing conditions immediate causes death caused COVID-19 (like respiratory failure/cardiac arrest), tell us anything prevalence pre-existing conditions themselves. analyses show they're present majority deaths (and majority Americans!), 94% number tells us 6% death certificates failed include immediate causes death. happen blinking Morse code, he? Hedonism astounding people seem understand wear face mask. really blown mind stupid people are. Yes unbelievable 6 months worst disaster many people‚Äôs lives ‚ÄúDebbie downers predicting doom gloom‚Äù. Guess forgot look bright side 180,000 dead bodies. There‚Äôs guarantee vaccine works safe. Waiting White House speech death toll next week. Even majority Sturgis' residents opposition rally year, would possible keep 250K people arriving settling one city? I've seen people try twist rubber bands mask better fit end much larger hole open side Yeah, really became race who'll first finishing trials Thankfully utilitarian.

My wife loss 2 friends, cousin lost husband. saw rosenstein similar position. Beloved center, lecturing Trump, always edge fired.

We found actually responsible investigating Trump. 

So here's pattern looking it, wonder actually going here. know later.

And desperately need vaccine. So, work reject people needlessly.

All say *this* want crooks running government. Everything suspect need able trust government right thing. would record. quickest vaccine developed 5 years. Define ""effective"". Harvard medical even stating might take 2 vaccinations year effective. Personally, like trust Fauci. topic, honestly think viable. Yes know smarter I, would get safe effective vaccine. mean, I'm familiar FDA. much say commissioner have? assume quite bit, unilaterally decided, right?

Good luck! everyone evicted would like would shortage housing. places truly housing shortage, anyways. entire quote flu ESTIMATED. flu treated COVID, there‚Äôd like less 10,000 confirmed flu deaths.

Settle down, you‚Äôre jumping conspiracy theory conspiracy theory... states dem rep populations.. Guess party overwhelmingly overlaps anti-maskers covid-deniers?

Other people mentioned pop density, forgot mention affected shape curve, less populated rep states starting ramp up. NY rates high early ramped quickly, Florida steadily increasing fuckfest. Deaths per million overwhelming higher rep-run states end this. 

Let's forget Trump Kushner straight seizing state-ordered shipments PPE supplies redistribution crony-run private business, refusing duty lead federally organized distribution.

Absolutely 100% fuck them, I'm done pretending represent reasonable alternative ideology anymore. Anyone choosing republican party member today - say without ounce hyperbole - traitor democracy itself. Love mental gymnastics going right now, delight watch struggle. article scare you? Good, done job.

While true viruses cause myocarditis, fails list COVID-19 - common cold, chlamydia, Hep B, mono, yeast infections also found people HIV. article quotes Alyssa Milano 100% accurate right?

Also, ""Though often resolves without incident...""

Source: surprised. ASU HPV capital world. dropped quest due thier 70K plus backlog tests... sad. doubting you, I'd love source numbers. feel like they're pretty valuable showing impact. Case point shouldn‚Äôt believe everything PCP/ER MD (not sure one present convo COVID + pt getting COVID listed cause death regardless); patient decides leave medical advice ER, ER staff (including ER doc) say patient insurance cover medical bill leave. simply case, provided performed/ordered medically necessary. 

As cause death, ER MD one certifies person‚Äôs death ordinarily, that‚Äôs medical examiner/coroner. ER doc pronounce death case arises, certified someone else (normally) Cuomo take seriously? 

Cuomo could ordered testing airports ordered testing. also made masks mandatory. things? hate New Yorkers?

Why state Governors (including Republicans) things? 

My point is, argue Trump mis-managed everhting, see examples done better.

I'm Canada, things better here, close borders lockdown US did. Prime Minister take seriously? main reason things better smaller population spread huge country. cities, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, bad anywhere. kind bat-shit crazy people refuse wear masks think huge party beach ok.




4) absolutely right masks. 

We've recently starting making masks mandatory. experts said thing experts said: Masks work. changed minds.

Imagine many people would still alive experts said, back March, everyone wear masks. don‚Äôt hide bed flu either Well, full - fifty hundred people dying state daily, every single day, entire week. ages ranged 90+ 1 years old. touch think everyone old feeble already died off, still plenty people dying off.  


By way, argument worth trying save people old feeble pre-existing conditions, since going die anyway? completely utterly foul. sound like caricature human being, would literally kick granny teeth save deep horror wear paper surgical mask five minutes lose five cents profit. I‚Äôm glad health care workers first. intents purposes they‚Äôre baseline society Pointed well.

Knowing would challenge ""its bad"" dipshits find filthiest hooker forego condom.  Lies dude, I'm south Texas schools local area open regular compacity regale times. Source drive 2 districts everyday way work 5 way college every week. cousin kids school CDC saying 40% asymptomatic awhile. means wear mask, line  Oh, bet they're lower America well, that's helping Denmark much, either.

For clarification, let know Denmark's new cases per day less current lowest point since peak. 600+% ain't pretty number. Thanks, note good option case start getting forceful it. hide behind whole ""We're family!"" thing BS. manipulating us saying they're us ""we think people getting anxious longer office readjustment worse wait"". need shit worry disabled sister mom working. Good thing savings, hopefully get point me. take care! plane uses HEPA filters big risk, airports problem plane itsel, reasonably safe wear mask face shield would highly recommend getting tested 2-3 days leaving make sure asymptomatic carrier. must dropped mirror. bad labor day coming people still give fucks. Yes. know. wasn‚Äôt China. FTFY Yes will, hope come stronger end.

I‚Äôm glad state right considering. hang well. Also, thank teaching. important job is. Probably based garbage CDC report includes years numbers 5 year averages. Duh. major problem February becoming ""lost month"" emergency powers used close borders China also gave FDA sole authority approve tests could used. FDA immediately gave CDC test green light demanded high burden proof everybody else tests could pass anytime soon. even use proven foreign test kits. CDC kit turned major flaw. actual problem quite opposite, failure rush alternative test kits. first two private test kits approved 26th 28th big batch kits suddenly given ok. Always wondered whether meant somebody lit fire FDA's collective butts, pointing absurdity failing test ""safety"" reasons actually made pandemic worse. die? God horrible human being. clue person grows stupid, full hate, full opinions. goes show saying ‚ÄúIdiots don‚Äôt know dumb believe they‚Äôre smart‚Äù true stop. One positive‚Äî nobody knows sensitivity specificity test, let alone epidemiology disease‚Äî utterly meaningless totally misleading headline.

The hysteria continue unabated I‚Äôm sure. Go ahead, downvote comment thread trying logical. focus shouldn‚Äôt meaningless tests healthy populations. virulent serotype causing issues. want like everyone else. Kids virtually risk death this, global context far greater risk dying diarrhea (that‚Äôs fact, please feel free check WHO/CDC data think it‚Äôs wrong). Meanwhile we‚Äôll continue lose sight big picture economic catastrophe idiot chief creating. I‚Äôm American. Got tested last week. Results less 24 hours. hear ridiculous rare wait times. \*cries UK\*

* doctor's give appointments, let alone sick notes, basic bugs (winter vomiting etc) even normal times
* school requires sick notes
* children expected attend 100%
* schools punished (bad inspection report allows privatised) attendance drops average - obviously half schools average time
* extreme reluctance allow medical appointments school time
* turning appointments doctors equals kicked waiting list remember different reasons. many scientists saying saying lot things seemed stupid even then. ""They"" also said spread asymptomatically. ""They"" also said surfaces primary route ignored suppressed (even sorta shit see CDC tweets article) evidence Germany asymptomatic spread FEBRUARY, leaving doctors scientists trenches virus patients themselved baffled, morale crushed, belief science unbiased devoid ego times like - need feel right project certainty it, completely U.S., ignored every single piece circumstantial gold could gleaned early contact traced outbreak studies... near zero serious studies since. studies saw scientists calling ""inconclusive"", ""imperfect"", ""purely circumstantial"" CNN MSNBC March April cited gold standard months ignored people like Linsey Marr left many, even scientists, baffled easily mainstream could ignore evidence piling alongside dead Nicotine similar effects drugs dopaminergic reward system.Its easy think is.They tried fight liquor drugs before.We know well went. yet according CDC, approximately 650,000 people die heart disease year US.

There‚Äôs far worse things worry virus that, barring vaccine within next couple years so, eventually infect entire US. virus even feel effects of. (Edit- Yes, preposition ended preceding sentence.) 

Media sensationalism caused nation paralyzed fear. would try bulletproof vest instead name!

In seriousness, hope dodge it. It‚Äôs getting harder days. Hang there. That‚Äôs good distancing masks. 

My state one well, governor trying really hard keep number cases down. He‚Äôs facing lot pressure reopen everything, far done good job. 

That said slight increase cases last weeks reopened schools. Again, teacher, happy it. 

I like tell people someday look back memory. Doesn‚Äôt help everyone, get eventually. I‚Äôm lucky still live family time like this. herd immunity! Crap, guess rules drinking bleach then! /s Missing serious details make real news story. serving fish serving fish There's already 6 times empty houses homeless, cockroach den change things. bad measles? really know much disease almost eradicated time ago. 6% people died COVID underlying conditions. Wasn‚Äôt also bunch child trafficking too? Sounds like great event /s fine apart loss many tens thousands invested far, months labor (hopefully) temporarily wasted, won‚Äôt good supply housing. cause shortage. didn‚Äôt support assertion. can‚Äôt either, median 5 months, mean. 200k sounds low, 180k official covid deaths, remember ago excess deaths like 30k higher official covid deaths. Florida's governor need force nursing homes take back positive patients own. worse, told something probably bad idea choosing thing six months later? Starting school going shift covid high gear again, thanks ignorant leaders governor's order expected allow family members visit loved ones two time, wearing protective gear including masks. Facilities would need go 14 days without new cases COVID-19 among staff residents allow visits. Children age 18 yet allowed.

That's kinda like going Georgia, least granddad's nursing home. two people, masks required, meet outside separated 8 10 feet, physical contact. think improved quality life. place he's seemed pretty good far, two staff members one resident get infected, able contain virus one died. Riiiiiiiiiiiiight, placed faith statement magically disappearing, hoax instead. dumb. I'm taking directions do. That‚Äôs good start. How‚Äôs abstinence approach working out? Fewer would expect, good thing. Still agree idea event like though. quote use term 6% death rate. says: 6 percent *of 183500 covid-19 deaths* attributed coronavirus alone. doesnt say 6% cases. reminder AIDS virus doesnt kill own. lowers immune system point pneumonia something else takes out. 

More mental gymnastics right trying justify 184,000 American deaths

""Well yoj dont count NY ""insert bullshit here""

""Well really co-morbidities ""insert bullshit here"" feel realize nationalist propaganda shoved throat long? need look fully evaluate.

Some places seeing C-19 peaks, total see excess deaths, deaths per week go heavily average baseline average.

Rhode Island Sweden two examples. check RI‚Äôs data here.  people risk diseases mention would far risk *for* said shutdown. good go get checkup catch rona it.

An orderly transition safer business/Healthcare model competent administration would far helpful at-risk populations keeping services running full steam. Oh trusting medical professionals! know everything! trusting one? doctor says he's that, he's probably that. mean, ever say, means applies EVERY instance. Color shocked. realize I‚Äôm cat, correct?  know, democracy!

No, seriously USA psychotic oligarchy almost unbelievably dystopian nightmare around 60% population.

Watch 1st 48 times) destroy law order.  [Here 3M's data sheet different KN95 defined Chinese standards body, very, similar N95 standard defined U.S. Yes true. read whole post you‚Äôll see mention people. flu less transmissible covid19. We're literally everything flu pandemic social distancing measures already place. see data show vaccine maximum 40% effective good year add much top existing measures. Maybe makes sense health professionals, teachers, people may regularly exposed (or expose at-risk populations), country-wide directive vaccinate everyone make sense me. put overly rosy glasses either. good little bit skeptical. typical vaccines developed quickly. Also vaccine teams adding hype mix. want attention customers. want *the* vaccine people's minds.

Close eyes. Imagine event future new vaccines caused serious side effect turns ineffective curb spread virus. imagine coming back current time. Open eyes. Would write comment did.

There big stakes this. Let's hope get good vaccines, think *actually* good little bit careful. good leave bit ""what if..."" Nation worries COVID vaccine ready. Amazon sellers *say* N95s. Last time looked, masks claiming N95 ear loops. Part N95 spec full head elastic. 

I know masks are, see real N95s got sellers still restricting sales medical/industrial applications. Wisconsin Department Health Services

As opposed Dept Homeland Security. Context title helps. They're recommended good filtering let air means breath air takes path least resistance get filtered.

I've read pm2.5 filters decent though. Hey problem lot people want remove restrictions, would kill lot people.

And reason constantly going ""lets like Sweden, great success, Sweden.""

So yeah, fact good thing point Sweden good, people want open everything restrictions one less tool propaganda.

I care country's specific results context, know better. knew stuff Finland Taiwan did, I'd use instead.

I use Denmark fill X ""Country X much better Sweden reason want copy Sweden, want copy country X instead.""

Many countries put place X here. Isn‚Äôt KN95 doctors countries aren‚Äôt US use? I'm work comp attorney. Employers bar tort thier employees, means can't sued thier employees condition result unintentional exposure (in Washington exception intentional exposure) exchange worker suppose receive ""sure certain"" relief... not. I'm near constant litigation employers arguing workers particular condition thier job 25 years, say PTSD setting violent sexual attack social worker. 

Put worker universal health care needless arguing end. 

It's worth noting get sick eating restaurant broke health code standards product needless malfunctions get sued. take away point endanger peace tranquility people's lives make extra bucks... else lawyer like coming pound flesh(money). Conservatives personal choice, except restricts something want (like watch football send kids school), case, want exactly tell do.

Bought gave healthcare workers friends immunocompromised family. course 6% *only* covid. knew **from day one** pre existing conditions drastically increases chance dying covid. happen pre existing conditions INCREDIBLY COMMON US.

This literally known fact since pandemic started, changes literally nothing. Especially since we've also known long time even kill you, likely *permanent* damage heart lungs. reasoning supply N95 masks consumed medical setting. reason why, medical settings, N95 masks used direct care situations. N95 still somewhat effective something like COVID-19 even worn improperly. *less* effective since air get poorly-sealed spots, physical barrier place mouth nose still stop majority droplets. locking üíØ throw slug man Daniel Andrews jail her! woman never killed anyone, Daniel Andrews hand blood hands due incompetence ...why guys direct anger him??? would God's plan, guess okay? think he's real ""God's Plan"" guy. key findings &lt;50% participants adherent mask use intention-to-treat analysis showed difference arms.""

""We estimated that, irrespective assumed value incubation period (1 2 days), relative reduction daily risk acquiring respiratory infection associated adherent mask use (P2 surgical) range 60%‚Äì80%.""

I know I'm understanding 100% I'm taking away study masks alone effective control, multitude hygiene habits - masks help used correctly. People say ""oh 60-80% effective"" hell lot better 0%. I'm getting better every day!

Thanks asking.

I went family's birthday yesterday like 50 people.

No masks social distancing.

I feel sorry suckers I'm living life.    Ok. bringing people dying earlier. get people dying issue died due corona. I've made comments folks, right, pretty good chance person making comment anti-social personality disorder freak fuck you.

It's US, there's also non-zero chance they'll pull gun let know feel mask-wearing. Bingo.  maybe country realize health care system terrible. I've seen mentioned sure variety N95 masks exhalation valve, completely removes ability protect others, biggest reason wearing masks first place. places banned types, well neck gaiters, lack filtration. Developing countries gaining ground big-time 2000s early 2010s, shocked I'm kinda disappointed. No, he‚Äôs said vaccine expected available either end year beginning next year. Fauci scientist. He‚Äôs politician. got caught maelstrom shit show call American politics. 

You need understand science always changing. Always. country doesn‚Äôt luxury time here. really fucked right now. Source?

Or source ass? wonder much screwing around opening schools garbage level protections intended cause teachers quit, thus backdoor union busting measure. I'm sorry. deserve better that. Keep eye Amazon, supply goes watch get some. That's *really* stupid. Technically say ‚Äún95 vents‚Äù. non vent ones I‚Äôve seen K95 something. don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen 3m ones without vents here. convinced level ""herd resistance"" play hard-hit populous areas US right now.

There really isn't.

All control measures alterations behavior artificially lower threshold required herd immunity. That's entire point. people behaved normally, we'd see outbreaks again.

And have. entirely predictable pattern true every case far. Massive transfer wealth richest people countries world. Tragic. M-m-must caught double standards, quickly, deflect! grocery stores converted pickup-only back March. employees converted either stockers, pickers, fulfillment (curbside possibly delivery). would kept employees much safer, also general public.

So many stupid things done pandemic White House refused take seriously day one. see, good point. Case fatality rate? I'm looking population. state testing enough. someone dying someone dying. 

You're stats tell we're testing enough people FL. They're positivity rate proves it.

-	The hospital organization isn‚Äôt going Home Depot source masks staff. 
-	Some Nurses unable bring masks home.^2
-	Or unable use masks donated.^1

So truly don‚Äôt understand person using N95 makes available person B hospital? anything seems like protects less people overall 
  Theft actually fact government didn‚Äôt prioritize manufacturing N95s one biggest fuck ups. Half year later still shortage. Wtf Costco know? Probably fever 42 degree celsius thing dumber Cousins Vikings franchise paying headline garbage english mate.  different saying since beginning whole thing, everything predicted back march panned testing detecting 8000 daily cases? fox outlet seems actually making sense without snide, slimy editorializing mixed equal measure actual facts? He's Tough! Well maybe dumbshit realize people like living Lmao anyone wanting vaccine There's ""more"" headline. meant expected more. You‚Äôre lucky kind employer isn‚Äôt overreaching. I‚Äôve worked home years days month spent commuting, everyone home, I‚Äôm working longer hours ever have. Employers pay long-time wfh people way mind pre-pandemic. wear surgical mask. hate wearing N95 day. sad discussing even though obviously interest corona epidemic.

Why talk subs stuff interest you? wish damn tasty :( DHS even stepping medical discussion? oh right, governmental agencies collapsing please child. Roughly third number children.

So around 40% Americans stock. That's less majority

Looks like still wrong  look there's half dozen articles first two pages subreddit explaining how, basically, mentioned CDC page counts ""comorbidities"" even acute problems caused *by virus itself*, pneumonia acute respiratory disease syndrome. Basically, using method, shoot someone die blood loss, 'blood loss' would counted comorbidity.

Then *real* comorbidities, diabethes hyperthension, course cause death. well-know since beginning pandemic health problems greatly increases probability dying covid, pneumonia not, usually, symptom diabethes.

And excess deaths official covid deaths.

But lost immature little children WANT believe entire world faked pandemic harm re-election beloved US president force wear mask because... reasons. Idiocracy documentary Umm, hosting protest dumb? That's like arrested planning BLM protest facebook. mask sold surgical mask regulated FDA required meet specifications 21 CFR That‚Äôs shady hell. sister pharmacist Walgreens wouldn‚Äôt let wear masks first two months pandemic ‚Äúit would scare customers‚Äù. them, employee provided (Walgreens doesn‚Äôt supply them) won‚Äôt give plexi-glass shields counter. That‚Äôs shady hell they‚Äôre giving meds sick people day. work large busy emergency room told I‚Äôm allowed wear kf94 masks anymore stupid bureaucracy want employees wear ‚Äòhospital approved‚Äô shitty masks don‚Äôt even fit me. competition?
Constantly going ""sweDen aloT deAtH"" beeing unable see treand things going alot better sweden week week makes look like dimwhit. want look stupid? goal life, because, congratulation, reached goal.

We know Denmark better sweden, know got alot death. Constantly trying play good news makes look like asshat... Windsor Ontario, first Ontario mandate masks. definitely helped we've opened almost everything yet case numbers flatlined. actually makes financial sense force masks. It‚Äôs really pointless. aren‚Äôt even opening full capacity. It‚Äôs perfect match! Definitely nothing 100x demand last months PPE. administration got go. constant mishandling, deception, outright lies pandemic costing lives. Nearly 200,000 Americans dead huge part America fervently supports insanity. It‚Äôs disgusting, country really become shell used be. too! Every time someone tells ""leave then"" I'm like ""Assholes like made impossible"". Haha thanks! no. It‚Äôs actually call sign. ‚ÄúHPV‚Äù part it, controlled/issued FCC. assigned alphabetically - course, luck - managed get something ridiculous. vaccine wouldn‚Äôt late next year 

When say that? know lot people faith Fauci, but... Ya shouldn't. He's dude like anyone else he's wrong past. Hell, last week saying safe effective vaccine year. vaccine trials working (double blind) information effectiveness right now, can't ""know"" insider information.

This either means Moderna *isn't* double-blind testing vaccine ... Fauci's talking ass. sure why, thanks helpful suggestion. First no, misunderstand data processed kind trial second all, even access unblinded database antibody concentrations, that‚Äôs useful determining efficacy defined trial, ‚Äúprevention symptomatic COVID-19 two doses.‚Äù 

This really basic stuff. I'm certainly sad that. I'm enough asshole wish death anyone guess life own. take another you. always children. honestly feels like want woman's choice ends conception - hers. sub coronavirus, talk always one-way. I‚Äôll bet anything year now, still people talking everybody goes gonna die. Adding onto nice points made here, requirements (fit testing medical evaluation) employers provide respiratory protection N95s. prohibiting people wearing higher level likely feasible things legal requirements. believe certain states mandates currently stop employers preventing higher grade PPE worn, also apply. CDC ran experts anymore sounds like wear mask open exhaust port. think severely overestimating many people driving long distances right now. Thanks making light actual problem having. hesitant posting this, next time know better. Hope great day !!!! I‚Äôm familiar long stay home order Australia know BLM protests early June. Sure one protests important other, can‚Äôt allow people protest certain things allow protest another. I‚Äôm America tho, sure guys Australia. that, prithee?

Why what? Covid causes bump deaths kills people. That's 2020 bumps isn't, comparing timeframe, January-July, years. even understand replying to.

Ah yeah says above. werd random reference period though.

The 2020 bump still though. 

If calculated % difference compared year average years before, would highest jump. 

That obvious visually. numbers, put excel calculate 2020 biggest increase death 30 years.  confusing lol, really good evidence immunity confirmed reinfection cases. It‚Äôs hard know think given seemingly contradictory evidence.

I think it‚Äôs soon draw big conclusions this, better say don‚Äôt know immunity works cautious case immunity isn‚Äôt solid studies indicate. Yup getting essential jobs pay bills No, that's real American Journal Medicine site. Complete recommendation moratorium prescribing HCQ front page. believe it. It‚Äôs variant theory ‚Äúwhen work anywhere, you‚Äôll work everywhere.‚Äù think corporation gives shit people profit bridge sell you. incredibly bad look even though justifiable health policy ground. Government arresting people protesting government policy? Orwellian begin describe minds people.

I'm aware tensions 'allow protests might violate social distancing rules' 'try keep firm grip coronavirus situation' think cases like these, small protest, think harm good arresting people coming protest government policy, even strictly limited coronavirus situation, going make many people deeply suspicious government less likely listen them.

Long term normalizing idea government arrest people protesting government policies extremely bad consequences. CDC correct. Look candle blowing test different masks. Cloth mask almost nothing.

I‚Äôve also seen people put embroidery masks. stitch holes become seal breaches‚Ä¶ Yup. Tell local news. 

Costco's whole brand stake push hard enough. 

The way treat employees sets apart. n95 specific mask, level protection/efficiency. Ergo possible Costco prohibited reusable filter masks banned n95 level protection masks. wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs coordinated campaign, it‚Äôs laughably pessimistic. It‚Äôs hard resist making fun them. looks like Florida‚Äôs wave trending down, might also hit herd immunity. That's good thing reasons. extends life N95. Bulk bad shit absorbed cloth mask washed. N95 set aside days decontaminate used then. 

I N95s rotate like this. people know concerned safety. Fauci explicitly said cutting corners safety scientific risks we'll taking, financial risks, risks safety. compromising scientific Oxford vaccine, lead researcher‚Äôs three kids took April, Sarah Gilbert‚Äôs three children, 21-year-old triplets studying biochemistry, decided take part trial experimental vaccine mother‚Äôs vaccine‚Äîshe leads University Oxford team developed it‚Äîbut wasn‚Äôt big family talk. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt really discuss wasn‚Äôt home much time,‚Äù Gilbert told recently. She‚Äôd working around clock, one trying end pandemic, rate wasn‚Äôt worried kids. ‚ÄúWe know adverse event profile know dose use, we‚Äôve done many times before,‚Äù says. ‚ÄúObviously we‚Äôre safety testing, we‚Äôre here‚Äôs whole article dedicated various experts saying they‚Äôre cutting corners safety. guess go guess listen random internet nobodies say. fear-porn never stops sub it? Fine, never leave houses again, hope mental health goes gutter should. sub rule prohibiting sharing opinion, please link source kiss ground walk.

Last *I* remember we're reddit, platform discussion. What's happening discussion, whether u/RedditWaq likes agrees discussions taking place matter.

Also trying convince doubt Fauci, there's need defend opinion. also heard say 40% effective.

Where say that? link? lives don‚Äôt matter America. basically anything approved worn medical environment, cannot worn work 
 
I think KF94 approved medical use US exactly universities need set anonymous portal sort thing. Let students snap photo whatever stupidity happening send in, act based that. *not US Maybe learn difference living existing. refuse see straightforward distinction, there.

Society decided jobs essential. want cops deciding strike one disciplined beating guy death.

You disagree teachers essential. I‚Äôm college see actual party 2-4 people beers porch, Im Snitching . cause support arrest also support BLM. Also going happen me. People get arrested wearing clothes public. fascism? directed OP, dumbass argument school. fucking anything aren‚Äôt going try competent it? 

Why would need wear mask working home? Additionally, teach instructors use Zoom. mass mute button host use mute mics except own. kid raises hand screen using zoom (raise hand button) teacher manually unmute mic. Break rooms work group activities. 

Or mean, treat kids like treat adults big academic talks institution. 50+ attendees. immediately mute everyone, tell people ask questions chat wait end able unmute. corporations bastards non medical grade kf94, kn95 n95.  Nope. best, hope humanity comes around let place little value life, go. I'm sure cares others give two shits feels himself. He's got money. Welcome capitalism filters last long time, especially using go grocery shopping. It‚Äôs little harder people hear compared cloth mask, terrible. usually don‚Äôt conversations people I‚Äôm grocery shopping though it‚Äôs issue.

I two extra P100 respirators filters I‚Äôm looking unload interested. PM interested; I‚Äôm basically selling slight loss myself. Sorry hear that, stay safe. reckless Hmm, misunderstood meaning phrase, sorry. Strike. 

Costco's whole PR ""we treat employees better sam's club (an evil walmart thingy!)""

Go strike. Tell local news. 2020 bump even bigger done correct, 

And btw also wrong, deaths remain five year average average past months rest year. Absolutely NOT. Could find dr would excuse wearing mask it? Probably. shouldn‚Äôt. seem really eager pull word 'contradict' believe getting ahead yourself. misreading I'm saying postulating behavioral changes/policy interventions play *no* role?

Germane specifically southwest states surpassed 10-15%, he's look places like Arizona, Texas, Florida Georgia, reproduction number, Rt, lower lockdown. people somehow practicing social distancing lockdown? data seem suggests this. Immunity likely factor.

In states regions cumulative infections yet reached 10-20%, attributes interventions what's likely keeping worst bay. That's consistent I'm saying (we even mention Ohio).

He's cautious burnout threshold 10-20% necessarily thing HIT, agree with.

Can point specifically says there's ""hard cap""? I'm seeing thread. if, chance, *was* dying‚ÄîI mean, I‚Äôd feel lot comfortable family‚Äôs financial stability without NFL contract. live Orange County. followed data every day. absolutely numbers low enough get watch list. heard people complain cheating somehow, never figured exactly accusation was. mobile? type good news search box click good news flair one posts. Somebody let know there‚Äôs better way. main component remdesivir. Google it. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è real joke 48% bothered think it, last 2% rich care. bet sponsored property industry. I've best sleeps life. Yeah blows mind sadly work I‚Äôm dangerously high risk around even though I‚Äôm always masked Phase III trials?  lockdown Spain ended May. like virus spreading *despite* lockdown. 

The lockdown effective reducing spread virus, that, precautions like mask use social distancing keep numbers low. like Europe Spain's situation. Um, someone remind virtual schooling require students teachers public therefore, masks required? (which fair looks like likely be)

Thats said ""(which fair looks like likely be)"" Probably customers think world ""back normal"" completely safe shop retail store. People seem much want fool themselves.  disappointing company would put customer perception safety sadly surprise me. Strike. implying herd immunity real thing? gathered none really serious symptoms. fact, seem asymptomatic.‚Äù

To put layman's terms, that's SYMPTOMS ALL.

I'll take false positives 50, Alex.

Who wants bet cycle threshold 35? Scared confused: accidentally read fleece feces I'd hope since pretty much acting like beat corona. related ban masks vents them? sure N95s I've definitely seen mean besides breaking stay home order? i'm pro vax like play safe new vaccines. like give time see issues. tough one though, i'm expecting access months available, i'll watching scientific community reaction results general public. review paper, new trial, ""confirm"" anything. ""We need fleet cars. One employee. employees must use Model vehicles Dealership X.""

""I Model already home. got Dealership Y.""

""Wait that's illegal."" viruses burn without fresh supply new hosts moron. ... **not** October. interested vaccine tested safety efficacy, one skipped Phase III trials. rare disease immunocompromised. moment wearing mask made fleece spread droplets without think people never really social creatures begin with. reddit lol also try see point view, maybe they're scared see good news we'll stop careful continue spread virus make worse. agree though sub main source get information get really depressed reading many comments. No, information available far point towards vaccine effective available next year. read title, misleading.

first, backlog cases last 2 weeks.

second spain finding lot asymptomatic cases testing.

third, WAY LESS hospitalizations, ICU occupancy deaths compared first wave. 

20 deaths day second wave compared 700 day first wave.

Masks distancing work. Yes, higher numbers infections, masks reduce potency virus. 

So, much better control time around. Exactly. millionth time, *you* dying, dude, selfish ass taking grandma, grandpa, couple older vulnerable relatives, Thanksgiving. means turkey guess, eh Mr. QB? course, take account *random strangers* might put harm's 'masks stupid.'

Seriously, amazing 6+months people still utter shit like 'I'm gonna wear mask...if get sick, get sick' straight face. anyone thinks like that: one cares *you* get sick. one! *You* primary reason wear mask. Sorry break bad news you. Buying second home necessarily privilege.

This joke, right? people cannot afford pay two mortgages, even temporarily. Gear sick. gives f**k sheep, I'm going take chances health already working place 1,000s people roll every day.

As pointed another thread, advocating Herd Immunity, maskless literally sheep. Yeah remember too, disgusting administration. 50% idea expensive get sick injured U.S. Even insurance bankrupt almost anyone. 90% people positive test results contagious. know what's hard understand that. Comes perfectly legitimate source. Cheating unseal patient records soon someone develops covid. Trials halted time early success. Richer countries may outbid poorer ones ~~COVID-19 vaccine~~ everything you‚Äôre spreading diseases fucking kill people. serious? Spain clearly re-entered exponential growth needs lock again, least start introducing restrictions. mentality leads older men refuse pain medication end life. cared proud, elderly man farmer whole life. dying gangrene stopped taking insulin. obviously hellacious pain, refusing prescribed fentanyl patches. close tears one day, begging accept pain relief. finally let put patch on, died two days later. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Lmao they‚Äôll still lose anyway. graph shows steady decline 1990 2020, covid causing highest bump upwards death compared years it.

And that, comparing 9 months 2020 12 months 1990 2019, something simply cannot do.

No isn't, comparing timeframe, January-July, years. even understand replying 2020 bump even bigger done correct, meaning deaths 2020 counted.

It correctly, reading incorrectly. Anorexia fucks heart, probably. Pretty much business usual Michigan point. Governor even talking opening Gyms theaters again. Heck I‚Äôm even back office job could easily 100% remote. Smdh. Counties Iowa highest rate spread world.  So... Cases went day florida government revving reopening... There's already 6 times empty houses homeless

Wow. shortage *affordable* housing though key areas, there‚Äôs lot unaffordable vacant homes Meanwhile, I‚Äôm wearing neck gaiter folded half filter inside. 2020, neck gaiters mostly worn motorcyclists facial protection. get peer pressured wear them? welcome prove otherwise. Requiring proof vaccination already common things like yellow fever going country issue. 

There really ""freedom"" travel internationally. Countries choose put whatever barriers travel want. 

But really seems like common sense vaccine becomes widely available way safely restart tourism. Even countries require it, could see airlines cruise lines requiring it. Airlines want able fill planes cruise lines want negative PR outbreak onboard.  kids sacrificed, America. voted Trump, voting voting way, let's support celebrate sacrifices. Also, Fed going keep printing money big corps, smart people make better. Unironically sourcing publication survives straight making shit ^so ^tired ^of ^winning true. decision fifty state solutions choice. One criticized time. 

The President broad authority discretion times crisis. Trump didn‚Äôt want deal it. It‚Äôs election year, re-election cares about. washed hands this. 

This say aren‚Äôt small pockets truth say, broadly, wrong. Trump moved hide facts water CDC guidelines, fucking broad acquisition supplies. Remember states bid one another? insane. 

It‚Äôs lie party selling. Don‚Äôt repeat it. always days ago. Alot people pick prescriptions day placed. believe idea call customers picked prescriptions they've potentially exposed. people still think hoax, right? freaking September   suspect spent several years studying viruses, epidemiology, medicine. False positives sense viral debris identified. actual false positive per testing specificity pointing another state shut harder disprove thee point making hard Florida locked down. claimed less line average. Since half states locked average, lots states, show lower mobility changes Florida. 

The person replied produced proof. Totally loss words... cool bro. No, he‚Äôs - 1. Young 2. Naive 3. Lost 4. Jaded Pretty soon going make reason masks allowed. even bother. say masks penalty law end that. Oh! Wait! untested rushed vaccine too! Yup. Mine one now, suddenly, sports parents kids allowed hang commiserate outside school masks distancing. Zero enforcement. gonna hybrid model saw they're really enforcing anything school even started yet, plus parents seem eager act like everything normal exactly need guard alert. Switched kids remote...

Good luck you, gonna interesting Fall... Allow clarify second time. 

""High"" would number new cases per day that's least 150% country's current lowest point since peak. Denmark's 600+% one would call ""alarmingly high"". many died mental health issues caused government. many racial profiling shooting U.S? everything people global coordinated

üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò± god forbid huh? problem. Also, simply means 94% people died virus comorbidity. means cancer, heart disease, lupus. fucking dare people say things like, ‚ÄúWhy shut country people would died anyways?!‚Äù

Most co-morbidities things like diabetes, obesity. People live decades decades.  Anyone better link Huh. Thank sourcing links. really plausible virus begin China - absolutely need research investigation unravel question.  makes sense all, hundreds thousands dying Wuhan virus

love see receipt though

FOX? CNN? say ""was flu""? You‚Äôre guinea pig. You‚Äôre lambs slaughter. It‚Äôs pretty hard comprehend dumb tbh... it‚Äôs... everywhere. what's cure common cold again? also cure HIV right? Lyme disease? guess missed point Feel free make claim 53% 41% die coronavirus nursing homes would died within six months way. Unless evidence mortality rates nursing homes *from causes* **dropping.**

53% 41% ""40%,"" original claim.

I'll concede significant number, perhaps high 41,000 190,000, might already dead causes. think remotely accurate we'll see 76,000 (40% 190,000) *fewer* deaths, among *other* causes year.   first thought misread headline know Hawaii much larger decline going stop making claim using mobility data?

just kidding, give shit facts continue make spurious claim.

and everyone burden proof positive claims. basic rules burden proof. September incredibly hopeful target, ever going realistically happen indication behind schedule. Emergency authorisation December possible we're pragmatic, amazing drug discovery timeline would something like late 2021 approval. Along others said, I'd like add Oxford hoping emergency approval September back like early March first announced ChadOx-nCov. main reason getting lot hype. Beautiful bigly tests don‚Äôt feel free.  ex brother law one them, need positive test know reckless though DUIs. initial infection wave - 260 sick enough go get tested, bet triple (at least) minor symptoms still able spread it.

The infection footprint Sturgis attenders rest communities back home number keep eye on. Same. course it‚Äôs 3-fold get it. Little shits. NJ. thank Zeus everyday Phil Murphy governor correctly realized mandating remote option would let parents assess decide what's safe. kids schools fairly affluent (and liberal!) town, they're continuing contact sports, parents outside practices softball games without masks standing close one another SCHOOL GROUNDS.

This unheard near playground kids under, say 7 6, also wearing masks one month ago. NOW, lot assholes expect us go back normal extra hours kid free time working home, decide enforce mask wearing least parents around school wanna sports wanna dictate terms?

I always wear mask talking neighbors outside walking around neighborhood make sure distance don't. everyone else. now, want decide us comes end?

Nope. Remote learning kids either outbreak feels like they're things right, maybe exaggerated, feels safe send kids back.

Currently, though, affluent areas least, makings fucking disaster. Oh, town estimated 60-70% parents work home many non working spouse AND/or nanny, guess many comfortable hybrid model? 

EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT. see, school superintendent thought important point latest ""the plan"" email. wonder why? portable wifi, always get one travelling. Really shitty, selfish scumbags I‚Äôm expert. You‚Äôll ask scientist, Israel. looked asked. never looked state asked.

Or maybe person replying insinuating claim Florida lock burden proof. pretend wrong didn‚Äôt substantiate anything all, even data weaknesses? ""Man buys chocolate bar world battles obesity crisis."" happen. got best man job. name Jared Kushner. get back work stop girls blouse agree this, seems like maybe opposite reasons. think negative effects shutdowns massively understated.

Actually, know exactly happen open early, advocating would kids transmit virus less adults? Flaccid must american. Make China Great strange commonly held belief decades China value human resources, yet US ended valuing economy life China sacrificed entire quarter economic growth via severe lockdowns save citizens?

And end, China managed recover quicker too, economically speaking.   I'm sorry. :( Nope: no, stretch imagination would 0.005% fatality rate worse COVID-19 deaths.

If vaccinated, still may never contract virus.
At rates around 10 new infections per 100,000 people per week, probability contract virus within one year 0.5%.
Multiply IFR age groups, **you'll see one year covid fatality risk still less 0.005% people age 70.** (Beware factor 0.01 multiplying percentages) think could probably end sentence word Strategy. It‚Äôs probably consuming much foodporn Anorexic, shocked another risk factor. that's L C K W N

I think correct compare governers Trump. better comparison different pr√©sidents(either past American pr√©sidents) countries. many ways, Trump American people justice handled crisis. president elected exactly guide country times peace crisis say burden proof rests?

You made positive claim, burden. make burden proof, go read book take freshman level class wouldn‚Äôt rest person objective evidence claim?

You made claim evidence prove claim.

regardless, need know better way measure know shut bit Florida.

so know stats mention them?  true viruses cause myocarditis, fails list COVID-19 - common cold, chlamydia, Hep B, mono, yeast infections also found people HIV.

Well, good thing benefit decades testing ***this novel coronavirus*** definitvely state COVID-19 like viral infections.

Kinda figured post would popular mystery fart movie theater.

Key keep mind 60-70% never set-in-stone herd immunity threshold. realistic worst-case-scenario picked work backwards from.

Depending ask, there's consensus pockets something low 20-25% could HIT. I'm really bandwagon, least sense point reach *sterilizing* immunity.

Too many people predisposed writing *any* potential role T-cell protection, though. Honestly, that's worse jumping ""20% HIT"" gun.

IMO best read evidence right *is* population immunity effect kicks around 15-20% (or around 4-6 weeks spread), may sterilizing immunity, protects disease material enough way cause viral spread hit peak burn out.

This pattern across two ""waves"" hit U.S. consistent lockdowns, distancing, masks, varied broadly timing compliance across NY/NJ/MA AZ/FL/TX, reasonable candidate main driver.

I think that's strong enough evidence say that, places spread virus continuing yet start, masks distancing dropped.

On hand, someplace reached 15-20% long time ago there's consistently low community spread months end, yes, try going back normal. fly Portland last month emergency ended good. People kind forgetting social distancing airports honestly way better America Europe surprisingly.

You first educate fight poverty make illegal sick men actually feel consequences Immunity binary concept. People don‚Äôt understand this. think absolute.

No system body functions perfectly time. always anomalies. China already tested people. already lab ratted people far looks safe. 

The rollout happen China first. spout ‚Äú6% deaths covid‚Äù, roughly 9,000 people. acknowledge deaths say ‚Äúthe 94% due comorbidities‚Äù. say people stay home rest us want. don‚Äôt add comorbidities include obesity half country listed obese.  Again, change that, always active matter do.

No Corona insanity! Well done Sweden. think 350,000 showed one. I‚Äôve also heard online people going festivals states seen video dirt car racing Iowa could see two big stands full people. Probably thousand. Crazy town there. Mask use city vs smaller towns night day. lot rural areas give shit, concerned due less density, conservative ideologically opposed mask use. Netherlands.

Landlords provide housing, buildings gatekeep used function unless given profit. best middlemen, accurately parasites. lick boots they'd put street useful heartbeat. Absolutely this. Keep surgeries going costs. Pack waiting room. anyone saying health workers screened; assuming goal patient employee safety, not. goal staff run surgeries, pre/post op, floor. positive can't work tests actively discouraged. Employee Health hospital telling people symptoms get tested. keep saying ""If wear proper PPE matter."" Except like said wearing masks properly ""don't feel sick"". messaging virus danger asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic transfer blame, health care people know still acting like flu transferred symptomatic feverish. joke. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Duh never possible US uncontrolled spread. can‚Äôt even manage tests symptomatic people. need school. don‚Äôt learn well home. can‚Äôt stay focused. school makes stay focused. know worst happen get coronavirus weeks lungs may little weaker afterward. long vulnerable maintaining social distancing wearing masks, won‚Äôt get it. would rather education compromised virus won‚Äôt infect me. hell, went italy early January, probably already Again?  US situation could quite opposite 
FDA/CDC pushes vaccine tested phases. wait phase 3. ready drink bleach. School childcare education. balance changes depending age child. both, can't really deny that. 

Lower income households likely reliable internet connection (which essential home learning); often one computer device---if all-- shared among children.

Who watch children parents go work? can't leave child home alone certain age. 

CPS Chicago found something like 90% low income students simply stopped logging end school year last year. essentially lost. 

Not mention school often main site recognizing reporting domestic abuse; school lunch program often sole source poor child's nutrition.

I go on. need socialization children certain age important subjects learn school. Children respond well staring screens hours day. stultifying.

What happen higher income families resources put children private schools offer in-person hybrid, hire private tutors. lower income students languish left behind online learning. gap grow wider two. 

To act like ""go online"" answer simple damn naive.  Trump hotel business lol. Yeah Oxford one looks good T-cell response given sugars coating base spike proteins likely screw antibody response. also hopeful UCSF nanobody treatment heparin worked UCSD. There‚Äôs reason UC system decided look therapeutic treatment instead vaccine. you‚Äôre living valley small enough you‚Äôre breathing non-negligible proportion air inversion, *much* bigger problems COVID-19. supposed surprised? US passport works go grocery store. context, 96% around level genetic similarity humans chimps. conclude virus came China stage, future DNA test murder might well start local zoo. get point, initially 1 person US 350 million.

And know turned out. Copying comment /r/COVID19 ‚Äî yes, seem good news.

‚ÄúI'm pleasantly surprised longevity IgA response Figure 2. immunology background super strong, nonetheless, seem recall class many infections display IgA response really last much longer IgM (though always, course). good see still detected positive relatively stable roughly 4 months post-infection.

The IgG IgM particularly different I'd expect.‚Äù

On whole, pretty good evidence that, least 4 months out, immunological response pretty stereotypical decently long-lived immune response. problem lost trust US handle anything related coronavirus correctly. Trump starts telling everyone take best perfect vaccine ever, thinking people going ask whether really safe so, right question light country's total abdication responsibility protect population  

Hardly, people think liberals increase debt statistical lies, people think Republicans good economy can‚Äôt simple math. Shoo, troll! get outta here! searched pictures event see many wearing neck gaiter face.

Some study showed simple neck gaiter may actually make situation worse droplets split smaller ones elastic fabric, thus survive longer air. course filter inside going happen protect everyone. Makes sense hospitals shut elective surgeries, screenings procedures... would spike excess death rates. Similar happened last financial crisis. caused public health infrastructure break down. data demonstrate caused unforeseen deaths limiting healthcare access early days pandemic. Mismanagement worst.  someone could actually provide source fatality data last 30 years us would great... anyone make stat percentage prove headline, raw data raw data. factual, politically motivated.

Why information hard find source linked every article? breeding generations fake news instead factual news words (Imaginary) Wall Builder: ""No collusion. Everybody knows. collusion."" Regardless side awfully hypocritical.  think college aged students/high school elementary come right healthcare workers. 

We hundreds thousands students living dorms sharing room, bathroom, inevitably hanging together. 

It‚Äôs going spread like wildfire community look videos parties news. 

It would also logistically easy setup college campuses. 

Again, high risk dying stop spread amongst group it‚Äôs going keep lot people outside school system safe interact general public. work CVS pharmacy, I‚Äôve never seen limit many meds we, pharmacy, actually order suppliers. 

I assume limit, probably wouldn‚Äôt let one CVS order 100k tablets Percocet. it‚Äôs within normal operating ranges shouldn‚Äôt issue.

The ordering largely automated nowadays. script entered in, shows many tablets stock, don‚Äôt enough tabs automatically puts order 90 tabs whatever available size is. manually override frequently count number stock meds make sure match system says have, messing one counts shouldn‚Äôt ban us ordering meds.

I assume happened CVS filling many control scripts DEA taking notice trying find doctors around prescribing many. Either simple supply chain issues, can‚Äôt send Percocet state one CVS, one location ordering much might limit locations still get Sweden opened schools two weeks ago, without major impact number cases. first six months SNF even Covid.

But thing, said flu since 80% flu deaths seniors. COVID average likely far lower 13.7 months, median kely well 4 months.

And lives value euthanize start with? It‚Äôs brainless writer hoping get internet clicks get away simply it‚Äôs pro-vaxx (who would dare question someone encouraging flu vaccinations?).

Even base recommendation point, arguments horribly base. No, plan hope vaccine help us get back new normal. balance living, working, protecting others. safe, need everyone else safe too. people can't stop going breaking quarantine. warning still ppl refused listen. drastic measures used  People would rather engage pedantic arguments look data *already* made least one bad decision.  Expert worship?! earth people supposed make informed decisions without expertise?? feeble minded must go life thinking know everyone else? wish virus attacked stupid people. gone single state yet? seems like second wave mostly hitting areas haven‚Äôt hit before. every 10,000 students, expect least 1 death. went school 10,000 years ago death devastating. letting virus run wild, asking every school country devastated alternative remote learning, almost certainly schools october anyway. that‚Äôs mass murder. example vast majority school shooters terrorists. think Polytechnic one that‚Äôs it. said least 4 months, could longer period. Indeed. Less travel commute = #goGreen !  are? Well I'm sick need this.

... See tell people part? makes easy liberals falsely claim death COVID actually died something else.

Because excess deaths thing 230k deaths year expected? Ask chinese person? isn‚Äôt new news, idea feel like blasting guy well documented facts. fuck else would need have? Death? 

I‚Äôm CA, want test get one area, thought fever like one symptom everyone agreed needed test. Well sucks. mask shortage still real issue, N95s low stock. reuse regular surgical procedure masks. hospital areas allowed access proper surgical masks, given /one/ per shift. what. point vaxxines give people illness without getting sick. first comment acknowledged conflated two. What‚Äôs damage

Doesn‚Äôt change data says - fuckload people die first six months SNF even Covid. Florida would like word. hmmmmmmmm...................... approve vaccine want even best. made White House basement use it. /s  That's good flair story. public health professor giving us extra credit get done lol. infect four people infect four people ad nauseam. People going die people decided go run ignore warnings. mature thinking. suppose sticking narrative blaming China US government's lackluster response containing infection. seems like another dangerous gamble, could leave US outsider access vaccine still pushing tens thousands new cases day. seems cutting nose spite face slowing testing/controlling numbers new US strategy. Wait... wasn‚Äôt back May everyone said season changing summer won‚Äôt slow spread... warm climates won‚Äôt save you? it? good. decision, United states doesn‚Äôt develop efficacious vaccine, access vaccine. Plus, COVID problem must solved worldwide solved one country, unless want cut international travel indefinitely. I've tried. go feedback loop. See pneumonia deaths either people going die next month anyways, faked get money government like Covid deaths. It's.... Infuriating. Shocker info references blocked scrubbed Chinese internet. Discussing would give people problems it‚Äôs worth. CCP doesn‚Äôt want known CCP opened fire killed hundreds Chinese people airing grievances government. reports lower HIT (20% even lower) keeps coming. Meanwhile articles pushing levels agreeing classical/well-mixed 50-70%.

It‚Äôs also hard know many develop immunity without detectable antibodies. add confusion lower *apparent* HIT. 

Since place without mitigations it‚Äôs also hard separate effects immunity.

The classical 1-1/R0 isn‚Äôt exactly natural law, it‚Äôs naive approximation. It‚Äôs like assuming people jump plane accelerate infinitely, disregarding air resistance. experiments find ‚Äúterminal velocity 120mph!‚Äù that‚Äôs similar discovery. would much surprised see HIT 60% one 40% 30%, conditions 60% apply special. Yeah 300,000+ attended 260 case, likely less 5 hospitalizations 260.

I'm sure damage done drinking piddly numbers seethe Last time Trump running president, people saying would leave country won. voted Hillary wasn‚Äôt planning leaving country thought ‚Äúnon-politician‚Äù deserved shot worst case would gone 4 years (oh wrong much damage 1 president could do.)

This time, actually want leave country wins it‚Äôs even possible wall around US preventing us leaving all! Part reason leaving fear happen country Trump pushes crap another 4 years another part needs hundreds millions people vote win. many horrible simply stupid people US, don‚Äôt want risk life proximity people pandemic violence streets happening.

I love country lot people ruining it‚Äôs stressing heck out. One reasons love country values human life slowly changing plan statistic. rather live abroad US longer going US everything stood for.

I plans take matters hands defending country weapons potentially life. many respectable countries risk life one. never thought would say I‚Äôm currently watching US destroyed elected president.

God help us fall. plan eat collapse way? Literally you. ‚Äúbrain fog‚Äù pretty annoying last days. Smell 70% back one nostril taste 60% back. Hope ends soon us. pretty reputable. course did, lying projection Americas 2 favorate pastimes afterall Well, duh! testing result higher case count. important stat consider positive percentage rate, accurate indicator spread virus. Let get straight. scenario think customer picked prescription 3 days ago, virus live 3 days outside body, customer clear? ""In recent years, flu vaccines reduced risk flu-associated hospitalizations among older adults average 40%"" - CDC

Sounds real effective there... I'll take rest anyday. means, go line flu shot. What's different US makes even viable strategy? people like talk shit?

America far advanced science technology compared rest world. likely explanation everybody else lacks technical expertise do. give fuck wastewater testing either.

You may delusion reason fundamentally unreasonable people. patient comes emergency department chest pain, whether COVID important smoking diabetes history. like personal attacks start people run arguments.

I make personal attack, fact taught math four comments, even thanked me, please, report Guess hard defend Denmark nowadays.

Hardly, cases well Sweden many countries fallen 37% last two weeks.  Would take vaccine promoted Trump administration? I‚Äôve got shots I‚Äôd certainly hesitant there‚Äôs change executive leadership. theory work unless get sick die something could prevented. may also infect someone know - friend, spouse, mom dad. may live may lucky. grim reaper here, facts. Speaking experience, I've RN 24 years. trying help. perhaps die diminished healthcare access??? 2 months hospitals shut except emergencies. elective surgeries canceled. Cancer screening weren‚Äôt done, etc. well intentioned hospital closures cause separate wave deaths directly linked COVID?  Agreed. vaccine originating US Russia absolute bullshit. that?

Family Matters. Yes one thing immediately note study done adults, found adults shed virus 2-3 *months*, better question ‚Äúis children‚Äôs infectious window reduced percent shedding window?‚Äù outbreak unit doc decided work two full shifts sick. continued eat lunch together small break room public staff meeting restaurant 

So yes, many try protect wearing simple surgical mask also make stupid decisions. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  attack?

Everyone knows happen. Anyone posting could predict happen. Honestly, think cases surge week. text state's DNC stating economy comes public health welfare Americans. whole lot difference Republicans Democrats point. 

However, suspect interested truth. ‚ÄúMillions dead brain death far year USA. one figure why... Next 10 O‚ÄôClock news‚Äù do? eat 12h shifts? says even governments making deals individual vaccine makers would benefit joining COVAX would provide backup vaccines case ones made bilateral deals manufacturers successful.

Seems like absolutely reason join it... People work dangerous settings - nurses, schools, nursing homes - combined employers refused provide protective equipment, hide positive diagnosis coworkers, required sick people come in. situations ongoing, leave employer bad spot.

Sorry son, real world work way. country's law hold one responsible people's negligence failures. trump pre-existing condition, ur country fault putting u hold responsible.

For months, Miami Herald news organizations asked Department Health transparent testing backlog, absent data could obscure pandemic‚Äôs size hamper efforts decide it‚Äôs safe loosen restrictions. 

Although state pays private labs services, private labs complete 90% Florida‚Äôs tests, governor state health officials never required private labs report backlog.

You realise Vietnam third world country, right? Honestly atm, feel like U.S literally given virus. Everybody now. Restaurants forced open lose business, hospitals trying best save covid diseases. We‚Äôve lost virus. lost badly ashamed. We‚Äôre blaming countries can‚Äôt accept fact losers. accept reality U.S clearly dominant whatsoever. Uh what? said Americans exposed languages, (Spanish), lack exposure makes Americans intimidated languages. Positive rights enforce obligations upon others; rights name only. realize landlords providing housing someone? 180K+ people died far, thousands STILL dying day, forgive feel like crisis handled yet. remember Trump tweet compared flu 1/5 people died, WITHOUT degree social distancing, funny brought again.

It's funny say demonizing also claim he's posturing pretending play ""hero"". I'm assuming Trump hero everything right tirelessly working day keep virus spreading, seen Tulsa rally.

Bikers wear neck gaiters riding protect bugs rocks  simply bring excuse return school. idea pandemic changed anything this, though. Schools start less two weeks, we'll see realise Argentina third world country right? third population live poverty line 10% population live $5.50 day. government probably getting fairly close broke.

Masks compulsory many places. population ability continue lockdown extended period personally feel incredible sad situation face. definitely critical poor bugger live directly. reasonably healthy age 70, chance ""death"" coronavirus statistically zero. strong win 2 World Wars, still weak fight homeland. (which make sense.)

I remember reading article that. Main gist was, wars, especially fight locally require cooperation masses wars fought another continent. USA never challenged fight last 60-70 years result would hard government suddenly get people mindset. Lol, what? I'm thinking making innocent joke downvotes mean... ways know already asymptomatic? Sweden apparently hard lockdown using face masks(but obviously measures put place like social distancing) reasoning government health agency took strong role putting science based policies government interfering much, countries harder lockdowns enforced masks outside healthcare etc., governments politics play stronger role? confusing say least. 

Why scientists medical professionals apparently different rest world? seem pretty well outside initial troubles retirement homes.  


Here's reference typed. think prove interesting retrospective view number years.  Ludvigsson, professor clinical epidemiology Karolinska Institute Stockholm, said one way country governed. Sweden, independent bodies Mr Tegnell‚Äôs public health agency played ‚Äúvery strong role‚Äù elected officials listened them, said. ‚ÄúIn Denmark Norway, politicians stronger role. Politicians era crisis want look strong don‚Äôt always take decisions evidence-based,‚Äù added. 

 Indeed.

Despite US‚Äôs fairly awful response pandemic, surprised end year 10% deaths already been...erm, ‚Äúplanned‚Äù (anticipated).  ~10 town 13k Minnesota...

Yeah. Keep mind cause death data COVID case death data comes bit delay. Raw dead/alive data comes faster. Patients going exams like upper lower GI tested Covid negative asked self-quarantine 7 days prior exam. protects med personnel. told asked med staff testing regularly tested. definitely protects patient based item comments? thinking. virus doesn‚Äôt live long surfaces don‚Äôt think ingestion viable route get infected. mean official source...

In states US official source generally County role subdivision State. ~3000+ those. mean company wide layoffs. happened lead kept. I've also recalled since.

Also, note doctor. Sending test results directly employer sounds like hippa lawsuit waiting happen.  Yea make population level adjustments extrapolations compare across years. avoid exposure this, delay it. strong case religion based camps controlled government. think saw movie ‚ÄúExcess deaths‚Äù number requires statistical finessing best estimates get at.

For example, plot trends based estimated population level changes one year next. It‚Äôs incorrect assume right number 2.8 million people per year past 10 years... would untrue, population changes. Though 2.8 million annually correct last several years. precise: Mashall Plan happened war over. Ok, pretty helpful economy USA too. Taxes gone advertising made illegal. smoked less continued. would started two factors. 260 positive cases, anyone actually sick? hidden burden influenza: review extra‚Äêpulmonary complications influenza infection irony wear mask throat hole. look statistics seems like Canada similar development Sweden. curves shape.

Minor/uncontrollable things like climate, Covid introduced, peoples general behavior, course well people follow recommendations totally explain differences. LexisNexis great database this, it‚Äôs commercial expensive.

Some legal industry data sources too.

For historical data going far back, social security death index annual reports free useful.

CDC data going back years buried various websites.

State level data good harder find cases. CT scans expose body high levels ionising radiation shouldnt used routinely second one looks comfortable. I'd rather wear one came air tank assists breathing active one restricts forcing heartrate up. mean, country that's respected social distancing probably going able go contact others pretty soon.

Any country still suffering virus epidemic, probably going obey social distancing.

so... yes, please get damn shot Phase 3 takes years. really, side effects discovered phase 1 2 trials - must passed drug allowed. Phase 3 really determine effective is, seems unethical basically give people placebo say ""OK, try getting covid..."" cases AIDS closely related cause death, case positive covid test appears unrelated, based available evidence, including mother's statement. John Campbell üêê Hopefully.

 stopped drinking coffee every day seemed help. cup every couple weeks basically productive citizens work money stolen government pay people work homes. housing human right, another welfare program. Alert! There's COVID infected person front door. end day, dead one hundred years. So, point stop count ? 1 month ? 1 year ? 10 years ? would true random antibody sampling.

It appears unreported/reported ratio getting larger,

meaning larger percentage infected without issue. Yes, weird effects too.

For couple months, auto accidents associated fatalities fallen sharply many major national auto insurers started issuing partial premium refunds, fairly unprecedented.

So deaths didn‚Äôt happen offset direction, meaning something explain excess deaths plus anticipated deaths know didn‚Äôt occur. Think viruses bacteria right now. 30% asymptomatic good thing, imo, bad one. Nine cases employees, remaining 1,017 student cases. nearly double previously reported case count 557 Aug. 27.

The percent positive rate latest reporting period, Aug. 28 Aug. 31, 26.3%. also increase previously reported rate 16.6%.

Everything totally control, move along citizens nothing see here. excuse return school? take written excuse return (or within 2 weeks, later accepted). Otherwise, everybody 18 older excuse themselves. article misleading. may sound low, total deaths tracked lots different sources industries.

Hiding actual bodies doesn‚Äôt work scale.

What really means we‚Äôre likely counting direct cases COVID-19 pretty well.

The official toll 180k, matching time frame little 200k excess death versus recent prior years?

The obvious answer we‚Äôre probably counting deaths COVID pretty well. masks Asia SARS? *Blue pill red pill?* make sense me. 

How want things ''look normal'' running risk repeated outbreak?

If want things normal election prioritise health pay masks? get transmission lower maybe think going back normal? end horribly. masks like wondering effective. article say valve masks cloth pocket filter not.

If they're effective, could cover valve tape something? Everyone alive pandemic wore mask dead. Americans ignorant ignoring English signage using Spanish directives?  Sociopathic traits linked income. Right biggest Depression America ever seen. apparently enough sociopaths. shown surgical masks N95 without valves. I'm sure completely 0% either. It‚Äôs almost like needing food table roof family‚Äôs head gotten us bad position here.

FTFY good reason. ones infected us killing tens thousands New Yorkers. aware thing call poverty, right? Oh no. Should‚Äôve held ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Ñ¢Ô∏è‚Äù signs Wait, hell! n95 masks work not? wear thin cloth mask N95 camouflage.

It's camouflage. masks valves minimize exhaled particles much puts customers risk wearer sick. Putting thin cloth mask valves minimizes exhaled particles actually solves issue. There's enough PPE medical staff run herd immunity simulation 
page 28-29
Chinese numbers conform Benford's law, US doesn't. Go figure.

Imagine fragile US numbers proven fake, Chinese numbers proven real, still need project failure onto others. Right logic even people indoors may catch virus, seroprevalence amongst general population, much less likely spread. 

Agreed. That's meaning herd immunity. 

However, look viruses come one. forcibly eradicate stayed on, becoming seasonal like ""the flu"". 

So public policy / economy point view, herd immunity great news. well placed medically w.r.t disease, brave enough, then, vaccine - specifically second dose vaccine - first chance go without care.

If affordably risk it, go even masks sanitiser, loading vitamins possibly locally prescribed prophylactic medication. Check video explains science behind convalescent plasma: Okay N95 masks specifically likely required there's aerosolization particles. Sneezing droplets. put context, hospital staff using face shields regular surgical masks (not N95). Unless performing procedure produces aerosol. that‚Äôs fucking case! Sell n95 retail stores now! let nurses doctors use HUH?!?!?!? We've also seen much pressure administration placed cdc give approved version, treated ""fake news"". Damn, doom thinkers takes responsibility anything.

J/k - totally know fault idiocy lack care. **Fastest ever developed vaccine** - Ebola, took nearly five years

**This one** - gonna done less half year

hmm. happens someone longer income? Weird see number articles saying vaccine late 2021. ""Some may die, sacrifice willing make""

(Yes attribute side too, thing is, one two choices. like sports match, presidential elections. God forbid figure third way uproot shitty system instead) you‚Äôre smart. gasket piece foam actually. cut one dollar-tree foam board. Smear silicone adhesive back, stick fitting, sealed. wasn‚Äôt even judging people worry though. He‚Äôs judging people deny good news. There‚Äôs difference precautious paranoid. People need realize DHS, CDC, FDA, etc government agencies use politics way to
base shape decisions/policies. others based party charge. 

As government entities conditioned think know best experts. things scientific medics way help citizens side effort. Private sector experts always disagreements. We've known PPE shortage much longer coronavirus around honestly. ‚Äúlikely‚Äù Fauci famously cautious? im glad he's realistically entertaining possibility incredibly relevant. Epidemiology tells us covid spreads via super spreading events, *which shut public gatherings*. 

The point point fingers blame conference, avoid happening again. People know going world? I‚Äôd wear asbestos/mold abatement mask... TIL I‚Äôm scientist lol unless correctly fitted you, you‚Äôre fully protected even N95. amount people see constantly readjusting face mask everywhere I‚Äôm astounding. 
The argument isn‚Äôt N95 protect more, that‚Äôs obvious. It‚Äôs needed general population consensus medical community no. You‚Äôre drilling people‚Äôs mouths like oral surgeons polishing like dentist making airborne mean point without even looking I'm comfortable assuming can't fired President. wanted know, ‚Äúrecovered virus‚Äù, still virus weaker version still harm you, completely gone body (obviously unless catch again) state local governments fine. Trump repeatedly puts hand scale working counterintuitively. blame comes except Trump deserves brunt blame. bare minimum could wearing damn mask he's public. People led example. currently example cheif fucking up. think least vaccine announcement October 22nd FDA said potentially emergency approval. big question emergency approval is, fast general public able get it? lie? schools still stay opened. meant surgical ones Amazon.  Yes, that's huge issue high school, too. freedom speech Australia (and need bunch slave owners give us), also understand consequences actions.

She get shot head getting bed middle night, tear gassed, beaten thrown unmarked car unidentified federal agents.

She calmly informed rights going trail January 2021. still believe this.

Yes mask shortages priority made health care workers. telling people use spreads virus solution. solution get masks. We've time figure out. Hell time first time too. 

The decision tell others less safe helping situation. quite what? producing millions doses preparation approval? They're outright trying kill large percentage. wonder works, considering steroids reduce activity immune system. think OK government officials lie people think good? seeing Smashmouth worth it? Statistical fluctuation, move on, nothing see here.  genocide claims come going say tried That's good point. get wrong, I'm pro-Trump way, I'm also pissed governor. direct quote study, okay I'm saying directly related elections clearly could care less who's president. people power always good seem Probably mix introverts people want feel like they're living Black Mirror episode. Plus quite people happy lives world pre-pandemic, want things go back normal. Hey remember [Trump Replaced White House Pandemic-Response Team Jared Don‚Äôt see? care themselves? mean, probably change to. agree   let get straight. Young people least process getting educated see ridiculous party middle Pandemic? still wear surgical mask KN95 don‚Äôt even see COVID patients. much employee-employee spread department. work others hate though. nice hypocritical. friend mine went 5am days he‚Äôs said there‚Äôs around 5 ppl Per gym floor (around 15ppl total) wearing masks. I‚Äôm assuming go early take virus fairly seriously. Yes. 

There two ways get herd immunity - create vaccine get enough people sick recovered retransmission rates naturally lower. 

The administration pushing quickly possible get economy stabilizing November. enormous risks involved getting accelerated, honestly see risks worthwhile get economy back (and time election.)

It's nakedly self-serving part administration made think anything else would happen? Something tells folks charge aren‚Äôt frontlines. I‚Äôm even that, damn IPhone! Same. matter morals, intelligence Agreed, think much spread within school building. issue students still hanging maskless outside school (I teach high school), they're spreading way. want look like taking seriously might make customers shop less. That's anonymous reporting OSHA petty Fauci telling people March there's ""no reason"" go around mask, even though there's great reason (prevent transmission), prevent hoarding. 

(No, linking source anymore; old, thoroughly documented, feel need challenge this, revealing uninformed comment.) jail seize pension so.

I would love source claim.  understand Trump administration driving effort behind Abbott rapid tests, right? works months.

The federal government already purchased 150 million tests distributing state governments use schools. food supply globalized. country get 100% raw food, food processing ingredients process machinery, food related items self-sufficient sources? food storage?

If answer good luck nationalistic response lol. Underrated insult Yeah there's line cautious tempering expectations downright pessimistic lol. comes great cost. DHS said paraplegic teacher use wheelchair school ""sends wrong message"" DHS would lose immediately, see difference Fauci saying this, that‚Äôs promising. reason misleading regard

Isn't Fauci said beginning masks effective, despite masks effective almost airborne diseases? using cartridges entire time, understanding fail safe (progressively harder breath without letting shit through)

What can't find sponge gasket things mask/cartridge interface, hesitant disassemble reason. reason low number deaths? confirmed cases Spain almost level peak April, instead 800 deaths per day April, like 20-30 deaths per day. Possible explanations:

1. Better testing meaning lot cases missed April. probably contributes, quite unlikely could alone explain factor 40 lower CFR.
2. Better treatments. possible doctors learned lot since April thus able keep lot people alive would otherwise died disease spring. applies, validates lockdown strategy. Lockdown key allowed time pass cases doctors learn worked well communicate rest world.
3. Different demographics getting virus. sick young spring predominantly old, could explain least part lower death rate. I'm sure 1 alone could account it.
4. Hospitals overloaded. 1 applies spring true case number somewhat higher, could still enough push hospitals capacity coping leading able treat everyone needing hospitalization spring case.
5. People wear masks make infection less powerful. indications strength disease depends viral load exposed infection. 

Finally, need snide. make point without mocking others sub. meant disposable. Reusing approved emergency pandemic reasons. wouldn‚Äôt reuse N95 didn‚Äôt absolutely to. Sweden hit hard early, 1 million Swedes go Italy mountainous places Europe skiing brought Corona back Sweden. experts believe rate transmission increase weather cools people start gather indoors, believe would bad Spring/Summer. look  interested projections. I‚Äôm simultaneously denying virus exists, spouting talking points saying everyone‚Äôs going get it?

Because comment....nah don‚Äôt even need check post history know be. 

How long locked for?  Denmark way deaths Finland. danes killing grandmas, ya know. anyone actually surprised? fuck dates DHS says? 0 faith administration. discount points, Pfizer government agency.

When Pfizer says several viable candidates, getting ready produce hundred million these, I'm inclined believe them.

We least 3-5 serious viable efforts US. others elsewhere. stage signs point viable vaccines near future.

I remain concerned fast-tracking much. can't ignore advancements. think critical gov FDA also encouraging work scientists making headway. Same. wear pajamas day. Regerts. 

It takes discipline work home though. Even kids school/childcare. depending type work easily get lost projects (I code too) wind spending way typical 8 hours.

I went bed last night around 3:30AM. Woke 9AM. get 10min power nap around 4PM days. also, new plan place dick election revolves around mail ballots. incentive open polling places quell virus. want people sick dead unable vote, everyone else vote home dejoy hide ballots passed deadline. Problem order get herd immunity need 75% Americans immune. 

If old fashioned way let people die, means 350 million x .75 = 260 million infected means least 2.6 million people need die. 

That number deaths would catastrophic nation decades come. cost unimaginable. mention don‚Äôt die permanently disabled. Maybe healthcare workers need more, like start pandemic? Yes. 
 
Death always goal How's supply N95 days? still place medical professional short supply, thing past, regular folks use without feeling guilty? becoming difficult get N95 masks. People know effective demand raw materials (these materials used world) record high long shot. trying preserve levels true N95s asking people healthcare use them. Currently market price real N95 masks level unheard time history existence demand. Hardly, peoples get sick needlessly pessimistic are. Thanks correction! first heard interpretations bogus

It couple weeks ago. misinformation around neck gaiters got pretty bad. Duke tested total **ONE** bad neck gaiter, news outlets extrapolated **""ALL NECK GAITERS BAD""** clickbait could muster Yup. invariably, doom sayers ones zero medical education training. I‚Äôm MD/PhD student that‚Äôs done work studying outcomes virus ‚Äî probably imagine much ‚Äúpop science‚Äù ‚Äúscientific hot takes‚Äù sub drive wall. wonder Venn diagram looks like anti maskers anti vaxxers? insultingly slow US. mother, friends another country getting groceries delivered extremely reasonable amounts, picking everything food trucks (yup food trucks got websites) liquor.  
Meanwhile instacart deal supermarket choice, bumped price food 20-35% acts pickers pick ups. 
And order liquor online, physically go store get it. 


You would think live 3rd world country, live 1st world one, America. seen Trumps new *health expert* trying push herd immunity new thing?

They absolutely are. listen experts fine. didn't. quarantined shit things. never, NEVER group trying give bubonic plague hopes achieving 'herd immunity'. contrast, used weapon.

Achieving 'herd immunity' disease burning Another way saying ‚Äúlet people die‚Äù.
Herd immunity going happen without vaccine. cousin 30, fit (he‚Äôs avid runner) got covid past March. didn‚Äôt bad symptoms, cough fever two weeks. However, went doctor recently heart rate going place. ran tests heart damage. get heart surgery correct it. wrong. would add pile evidence type behavior stupid. lesson learned could save many lives. realize long legit Phase 3 takes right? End year means preliminary results EUAs guaranteed. vaccine never hard make. time test everything make sure safe release mass market. mean. that's reasoning, say employees? It‚Äôs real. sucks. it‚Äôs lot common death. likely outcome hospital stay. Getting echocardiogram tomorrow can‚Äôt normal activities without heart racing exhausted.  worked New Orleans hospital. promise patients ""VIP"" would never sent home die. VIP means patient rich/related someone rich. get better care anyone else. disgusting.

I give shit doctors/nurses New Orleans take knee BLM, treat minorities matters. need look context, oversimplification dangerous.

But think understand dire situation is, otherwise deleted last response saying Covid-19 dangerous. top that, prisoners get higher priority well. slap face every hard working, diligent american stayed drugs respects others' rights. verify overlapping CIs relied comments COVID19 thread. Yeah I‚Äôm closing large gatherings. plenty states instituted mandatory stay home orders, think far oppressive context. mean New York literally made illegal go girlfriend‚Äôs house. accepted much rule what? People still died. 

This seen lockdown cases world. needs end never happen  we‚Äôve learned since March staying home much possible best way limit spread 

There‚Äôs still plenty reason That‚Äôs problem, entire country never shutdown. Let's ban swimming ocean lives would saved. I'm board logic! Dishonest? Nothing dishonest ignorant. Like every fucking person planet mayor choose wants. nothing wrong bad optics. Philadelphians make choice next time wether reelect guy. Teachers dont know wear mask not? really need DHS whoever tell that? 

Im teacher know teachers wear them. 

Do suffocate get DHS memos reminding breathe? presentation. Surgical masks N95 similar blocking respiratory particles, matters educational setting. I'm scientist. job evaluate vaccines would claim qualified. Probably either.

The people whose job evaluate vaccines overridden political hacks. Let jobs, I'll trust it, whats happening.

If want take untested vaccines administration pushed oversight order claim win campaign, go it. I'd remind though listen administration also taking hydroxychloroquine (25% increase mortality), injecting bleach (i assume 100% fatality), shoving UV lights sun shine.

I'll wait guinea pig another country credible FDA equivalent release theirs. should‚Äôve clear, technology today waste time. advancements made 200 years ago humans ever really needed modify environment enough feel secure. Forging metals, farming, decent medical understanding. that, ‚Äúadvances‚Äù made couldn‚Äôt keep impacts planet. I‚Äôm ball parking here, get rough idea. scale footprint species explodes post industrial revolution, really post electrification. never electricity, we‚Äôd ok. I‚Äôm tired people acting like it‚Äôs necessity. ever lived grid? Experienced it‚Äôs like meet basic needs, power, plumbing? have, quite time Hawaii. Human beings thrive decent resources utilize innate ingenuity, it‚Äôs built passed mega civilizations. reference people trying exist limited resource environment laughable, God‚Äôs name would anybody try live area natural resources, there‚Äôs ability thrive there, bad example. Humans aren‚Äôt meant live every environment, species is. 

Your last paragraph truly telling one. think environment, building blocks ‚Äútechnology‚Äù love, waste, you‚Äôre trippin. Go ahead try exist without it, civilization can‚Äôt even handle viral flu crying loud. flu get here, curious. Ohhh don‚Äôt know... reaching technology spurred capitalism maybe. Chinese citizens pushed fringes society, forced hunt animals known carry dangerous diseases human. Knowledge we‚Äôve hundreds years. That‚Äôs they‚Äôve priced traditional subsistence farming lives, cheaper imported goods industrial ag (capitalism technology). live fringe, longer living life they‚Äôve learned generations, risking dangerous food sources, coming contact virus‚Äô would avoided otherwise. mention biodiversity loss mono-culture farming reduces nature‚Äôs checks balances, increases stress species like bats, making susceptible hosting dangerous viruses. Every advance make right now, unintended consequences seem taking 5 steps back. Humans capable, it‚Äôs true, innovation exciting, can‚Äôt innovate requires less, using less, ensure future. Instead it‚Äôs, extract this, drain river, cut forest cattle grazing. know better alternatives, we‚Äôve known long time live little, seem forgotten that, hope depend everything get by??? don‚Äôt buy it. It‚Äôs really question gets vaccinated first. elderly healthcare workers first line ‚Äî get done quickly (and realistically, it‚Äôs plausible make serious headway Christmas), you‚Äôve basically eliminated concern hospital capacity *drastically* lowered fatality complications rate.

At point, intents purposes, systems-level threat pandemic United States over. People still get infected, small number still face complications death, you‚Äôve vaccinated high-risk, you‚Äôve made sure won‚Äôt hospital staff getting sick unable provide care (by vaccinating them), you‚Äôve eliminated 99% problem. buck stops here. president finest medical minds world advise him. goes advice lo behold, ‚Äú15 cases soon zero‚Äù 6,000,000, 180,000+ dead, 3 full fatality jumbo jet crashes per day covid deaths.

By prioritizing short term economy reelection prospects human life, caused thousands thousands needless deaths, also tanked long-term economy reelection prospects grow dimmer day. Talk lose-lose.  makes sense though. It‚Äôs reaction guilt abortions. society

only current boomers charge finally die MAYBE happen. worst. Considering Beshear Democrat state full Republicans. couldn‚Äôt imagine hell scape would Bevin. look cases county Jefferson county decent job based population size. Even protesting. Even counties around Jefferson ok. it‚Äôs border counties interesting. Like Todd, Logan, Warren, Fulton, Monroe McCreary border TN largest infection rate population. Like Todd county reporting highest infection rate state. Jefferson also appears ICU headroom well 21%. Another weird one Fayette County Lexington metro. It‚Äôs odd it‚Äôs listed outbreak Louisville seems managing better Lexington Bowling Green. I‚Äôm wondering borders getting traveling states aren‚Äôt handling well. It‚Äôs like shingles spreading TN Fayette County stopping. Sloppy writing part. thanks. edit it. Unfortunately America get brainwashed thinking universal healthcare evil. unnecessary. guy went large gathering underlying conditions? That‚Äôs stupid. I‚Äôm sure family go campaign of, ‚ÄúThis virus serious! Please believe us!‚Äù among people continued ignore mountains evidence virus. thats theyve wanted along. people 100% dependent them. Serious question. studies showing long term health effects COVID even asymptomatic patients, wouldn‚Äôt Swedens response deemed risky? Isn‚Äôt early say good job? 3 years seems like law large numbers would smooth spurious outliers... Wow, CDC something productive help Americans? live US, already profit it. found mild heart remodeling half people checked. heart isn‚Äôt be, wearing monitor getting echocardiogram tomorrow. got sick February haven‚Äôt able resume normal activities yet. care don't. want trust government, scientific community, support them. That's goal. Confusion. 

Confused people vote confident people. Republicans confident. Ignorant, hateful, greedy. confident. So, agree football player question want wear mask ""dumbshit"" said comment commented. Sigh @ 6 months still testing problems USA Fauci lie, tells like is. relief see this. Indianapolis? virus fucking legendary spreading  big picture they're irrelevant. Currently death rate far far lower usual flu. deaths also preventable world still content part life.

A family death always tragic, death part life deal it. imagine dying smash mouth  Deaths lag behind several weeks always, predictable. 

Hope Smash Mouth worth it. relatives started, like songs myself. wish better aptitude learning languages, seem expressive beautiful language. learning written also, practice friends native speakers. They‚Äôre already producing them. Warp Speed plans 300M doses end 2020. Would need free society draw parallel. Yay let's starve death protest virus 99.95% survival rate!!! Great idea! Money printer go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!!!!! US never actually real lockdown though, schools certain businesses closed risk higher spread disease. measures actually scientific backing, even though things always seem get political regardless.

Who knows Argentina really prevent protests, people know family insists government making terrible decisions quite time now, people definitely aren‚Äôt happy seeing savings devalue. It‚Äôs actually illegal convert hundred dollars currency USD, give idea government dealing hyperinflation. right. doesn‚Äôt.

However, bears repeating arguing good faith. I'm telling people wear masks ughhh hate internet ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è take landmines spread ocean set become deactivated 4 minutes heavy flow boats area. less likely boat hit landmine lethal. set become deactivated 9 hours, much higher chance land mine lethal. spreading active virus deadly cold temperatures, low UV light areas, enclosed spaces. Taking one factors helps change much much worse situation. meat packing plants processing plants UV light outdoor ventilation fairing worse say office also enclosed space close proximity workers.  


We evaluate countries mixed mask usage fairing freezing temperatures early get idea real world impact. think New Zealand 40s currently they're known proper adaptations pandemic probably wait another country lower adoption rate still colder zones earlier lower UV zones see first 4 weeks plays see there's increased case load. Go rebuff points then. 

Just agenda mean facts dug wrong. may representing one side story presenting outdated facts, perhaps, can't know sure unless research yourself. confirmed. experiment referenced test mask types. actually test box camera setup well computer algorithm designed count droplets. actual mask data relevant reliable dial experimental rig test masks, others replicate tests. Gov. Kim Reynolds pushing district open schools 50% in-person instruction.

Let's add governor Kim Reynolds list, along Ron DeSantis Kristi Noem, people made terrible decisions public health crisis lead deaths fellow Americans.

She defend justify decision wants, fact remains call make someone dead. someone, special ed teacher helped kids really need lot teacher Ruby Van Meter School intellectually disabled students fell ill died week

So special kids Ruby Van Meter school one less teacher help rough times. abandoned person depended help world make sense. kids turn someone else help. better turn Governor, though. Kim Reynolds care teacher died. wants kill teachers. scaled back bunga bunga parties. amazing that, one hand, hoards folks clamoring free wear masks employers, other, banning safest kinds masks workers. can't wrap head around this. conspiratorial.

Like, people make decisions simply care lives, make recommendation all. want hurt us, recommend safety practices.

The simplest, rational belief people us die. Well didn‚Äôt help either.

Oh sorry; /s Es lo que es. smell bad. that‚Äôs true. people spread optimism hope opposed fear gloom! Sure absolutely cautious don‚Äôt act nothing done advancements made stop virus consider research shows 10x cases confirmed positive... Derecho wind Iowa much larger impact Sturgis. Young people Harley riders gotten bad rap. pitched mitigating disaster conditions third world. Sanitation without running water, refrigeration, days weeks without power. Social distancing working hot humid conditions, many verge heat stroke.

I like Harleys older reddit, I'm defending groups part of. saw hard maintain safe practices people get essential services working. nearly universal, put blame there.

Southern neighbors. Stay safe y'all. would gain? No, please send help, vaccines specifically plz think said really dumb still 99% better dumb people don‚Äôt believe don‚Äôt care others 

I think good way putting it. He's least reprehensible kind dumbass denier. Nice username. would love Chris Hedges thrashing response COVID. It‚Äôs funny people don‚Äôt trust government trusting government. let‚Äôs forget voters elect current office-holder-in-chief üò£ makes people distrust doctors more. already lot distrust medical community African-American community. African-American women highest maternal death rates America. 

My coworker told nervous going hospitals right now. Patients allowed family advocate them. anti-vaxx anti-science tell wondered minorities (which she) getting care need right now. Like sister always vegetarian started craving chicken Sweden thought could go herd immunity, shut down

Turns people stayed home safe anyways, Sweden's economy still got rocked lack spending It‚Äôs advancements made since May people still freaking know nothing virus. learned virus 9 months we‚Äôve learned viruses 10 years! Thank you! whole sub toxic AF! Whoa, TIL - thanks! nothing vaccine work, guesses like times like things fast tracked. Got it. What? Yes, course. lying public prevent panic would cripple vital sector (especially sector front-and-center crisis), you‚Äôd extremist believe *shouldn‚Äôt* lie sake transparent.

I‚Äôve written comments past explaining still sure lying right move, it‚Äôs I‚Äôm concerned *act* lying. That‚Äôs insane. took title article lmao downvoted reported. Wishful thinking, Trump office safe, effective Covid vaccine 2021. Oh my! Yes, understanding repercussions. Maybe better approach actually address issues lead protests versus actually trying stomp them. That‚Äôs pretty much reason protesting first place. We‚Äôve put place gerrymandered political economic system effectively modern slavery. don‚Äôt invest people. Dude, statistics literally show Chinese numbers reliable, par European countries.

And argument must obviously paid Chinese lol.

Imagine brainwashed. Finnish man turns friend...

""You hear restrictions lifting 2m?""

His mate replies: ""Finally go back usual 5m."" feel way, save fresh produce trips early mornings one shopping. pantry items stuff like though order apps curbside pickup. Haven‚Äôt issues far, saved eons time stress honestly money can‚Äôt grab random stuff browsing around store anymore. Don‚Äôt knock til try üôÇ view outside. countries shutdowns shutdown whole country. corrupted Trump administration - Fauci alone clarified. Another thing read daily thread yesterday that‚Äôs absolutely true is...

Yes absolutely need cautious wear masks, etc. curb spread virus.

But say STILL isolating staying home majority time every day ridiculous. know LOT information virus people still acting advancements made since May we‚Äôre still gloom doom situation Absolutely shocking locking population inside six months could lead this. exactly problem. lol thing. N95 cloth mask everyone else. Plus, cloth mask helps hold N95 tighter face get better seal. sucks line thin slope steep Interesting thank politicians said exact opposite?

Yes, Everybody said ""some people die this."" Nobody said ""we deatbs this"" - made up. Please quote heads state said claim said.

Ebem New Zeeland Taiwain said stuff like ""we're trouble"" even though 2 countries managed feel point butthurt Sweden isn‚Äôt hated poorly written american op-eds anymore.

The reason write Sweden made bad unsuccessfull policies. 

And reason people claiming Sweden good would prefer whole thing went away nothing no: virus doesn‚Äôt kill 0.5% people infects, extremely misinformed idea.

Is not; look up. 0.3 0.6, around kills roughly 2-5% old sick, probably around 0.05% people 65. 

You understand % works. adds 0.5%.

0.5% die flu, complete nonsense compare corona done Sweden many places debate,

The numbers debate. Many times people died Sweden. They're one worst countries Europe.

Claiming good like saying ""hey think Slovakia one richest countries Europe, understand actual numbers, they're not."". think Los Angeles going this, never ever missed heart home more. describing obvious motivation school actually read ‚ñ† use N95 respirators may regulated OSHA encouraged for
everyday use School setting. final paragraph says: ‚Äúsadly much‚Äù 
Why booing me, im right sure want government involved medical choices? Obesity another risk factor.  Plague recurred quite regularly centuries, even point plague bacterium isolated. 

It really burn out. Like seriously, WTF? much conflicting misinformation take? political, sheer incompetence. you? never shutdown. Let's turn half population potential criminals! 

Robocop come! Could post nasal drip living conditions. Sleeping fan on, dry air/AC on, medications, allergies. post nasal drip really hurts throat times, go away sinus medication - tried any? idea taking about. probably mean rubber kind filters ends take replace filter. Commonly used painters similar craftsmen. Funny worst states ones locked down. cover fucking face hard. need medical grade gear. 


""one scientist"" speaking Fox. joke, right? Oh yeah, I‚Äôve going gyms California last 15 weeks masks around 40-50 people daily I‚Äôve fine. Sometimes don‚Äôt even wipe machines, complaints anyone. It‚Äôs amazing gyms open long have(especially California). need wear mask, smart good time. Don‚Äôt stress irreplaceable healthcare workers. 

Lol, aren't. Ok flip side crap thrown around. mayor philly,he ass deep shit, covid, riots shit goes since early spring. 

So took time maryland. ate place open indoor dining. crap dealing with, tell would handle it.  depend entirely one presidential candidates vocal getting people vaccinated.

There signs Trump wants many vaccinated quickly possible, surprised r/coronavirus r/politics turn anti-vaxxers overnight. it!!! PAX East happened weekend Biotech conference good chunk exhibitors pulled foreign representatives (For example, Sony completely dropped even though one biggest advertisers show). government downplaying possible risk virus getting country. world gave idea? bound impact may generational thing many people *didn't* learn Fauci's experience HIV COVID seem suggesting.

Many us Reddit Olds experienced years HIV panic firsthand similarly scary time known spread. 

Antony Fauci well known time AIDS ravaging country authoritative researcher subject. saw speak NIH conference attended high school. distinctly remember coming back telling dad Antony Fauci keynote speaker impressed that.

At time, science education lauded Fauci treated respect. think many us remember time even passionate expertise we've got direct comparison treated versus treated now. much miss days scientists treated experts deferred to; current anti-science anti-intellectualism overtaken masses alarming. understand point comment originally commented? Hint: players' lives. her's totally ok, everyone else immoral.

I judge intent everyone else actions alone. Wonderful! nothing ever change minds, even death. thing left laugh. Lol holy shit dude, it‚Äôs piece cloth. Families separated border kids locked cages. much snowflake act like wearing mask ‚ÄútReAdInG FrEeDoM‚Äù

All idiots claim ‚Äúpatriots‚Äù ‚Äúlove country‚Äù can‚Äôt listen science simply wear mask help fellow Americans. I‚Äôm embarrassed share country OP take way. took ""The stupidity clearly overwhelming science faith humanity even basic reasoning skills, let alone compassion shot. Let burn cause huge portion population stupid admit there's fire let alone take steps put out. can't put without them, fuck it."" keep socially distant lose house struggle afford feed yourself? shitting economy till 2022 make reality lot people clear, idea strong survive old infirm die betterment society core fascist platform.

""The people die old weak"" fascist talking point. part parcel rest modern Republican party. trying say? think along lines ""If actually take measures protect yourself, acknowledges knowingly putting danger, makes us look bad. optics matter lungs, can't afford quit job, peasant,"" Yes. Don‚Äôt listen Fox. journalism garbage.

So much journalism garbage. Naturally, herd immunity gets sensationalized clickbait like much else virus. common cold actually wastebasket term referring mild upper respiratory disease. time get cold, there‚Äôs good chance virus causing closely related virus caused last cold. First time I've heard term 'twindemic', though I'm surprised. everything conspiracy! sharknado, next telling there's thing zombie apocalypses. ü§î really see problem keeping patients going plastic surgery waiting months, handle pandemic. common cold 200 different viruses (a coronaviruses, number rhinoviruses, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, RSV) usually cause significant symptoms. Some, like RSV, would worth researching vaccine extremely dangerous specific groups (newborns RSVs case). Adenovirus vaccine , mostly used military recruits.

In general there's whole lot interest funding trying make 200-in-1 vaccine something mild inconvenience people. someone diabetes expected live 2040, catches Covid-19 dies 2020, killed them?


Same question pre-existing conditions. 


And many Americans pre-existing conditions? optics. school is, probably unnecessarily, concerned falling OSHA regulations teachers wear N95 masks. clear actually read document.  Unfortunately people listening fingers ears yelling LALALALA PANDEMIC Yeah that‚Äôs basically struggle with. one hand, you‚Äôre going face loss trust long-term, hand, don‚Äôt lie, face potential catastrophe immediately, really isn‚Äôt much middle ground two options ‚Äî pick either telling truth telling truth.

Like said, still sure know answer ‚Äî say pretty comfortably I‚Äôm unsure grounds government shouldn‚Äôt lie ‚Äî that‚Äôs silly. LMAO. politicians steal millions billions. worried masks?? great news! ""Under 5,000 deaths"" amazing claim, considering increase 3,280 deaths per day Wuhan alone early days:

"" authorities continue insist death toll outbreak Wuhan 2,535, news reports social media posts weekend revealed seven crematoriums Wuhan handing 3,500 urns per day since restrictions eased. ""

""Crematoriums city typically conducting around [220 cremations per coronavirus outbreak. reports epidemic‚Äôs peak February claimed [were running around ""

\-- 

"" think statistically likely, all. "" instincts right. statistically *impossible*. CCP known lie absolutely shame. brainwashed moron would believe anything say now. I'm reticent hopeful, anyone explain along I've heard making effective vaccine Coronavirus nearly impossible, yet we've seem come closest less year? changed understanding Coronaviruses allows never one before? Argentina almost three times less deaths per capita America despite fully developed country.

Edit: Also lockdowns supposedly actually anything anyway afraid them? I'm 9.6% area. I'd like see companies want employees die collect profits.

What difference make? hedging bets that, matter what, make money them, dead alive. GUARANTEE employees monetarily worth dead alive companies. specifically say, ""We want dead.""? Come on. get kN95 masks, almost good n95s. iirc, goal 30k enrolled months start collecting results. yeah... end year optimistically, early next things go perfectly. That's we've expecting now. 

The concern FDA starts announcing they're prepared approve vaccine months then. That's unrealistic dangerous. mute company's ""IT help"" slack channel everyone aged 45+ posting questions like ""I longer access email phone, anything fact service can't remember password?""  man 60s, underlying conditions....


OMG GONNA DIE Nothing wrong that. It‚Äôs murder. 767 died flu New Zealand 2015 around 26 died Covid 19. There‚Äôs something suspicious that. think New Zealand hides numbers. Tons companies organizations think way extraordinarily careful bringing employees back work.

However, companies organizations usa.

Our business treating covid utmost concern. one back except skeleton crews labour day. Max 20% capacity that. Signs everywhere. Mask use everywhere. Sanitization everywhere. Gloves changes everywhere. 

If somehow someone gets it, entire area locked everyone gets sent home, work home encouraged then.

People care covid viscerally aware lawsuits. usa doesnt give shit. Ireland damn near 5 million people. many strains/versions making hard pinpoint location factor. could make one might protect strains hundreds One less idiot Trump voter. That‚Äôs good point. I‚Äôm city million people person know personally caught three hours away sick three days. honestly hard believe that‚Äôs it‚Äôs overblown. I‚Äôm saying think per se it‚Äôs definitely tempting. bLm!1! behind paywall. reason could see prohibiting use N95 respirators would be, given limited quantity available, masks reserved direct-contact healthcare workers. said, people Petri dishes call schools going high risk. Ha! guess right. even realized picked slang. honest, I've listening lot Covid podcasts lately several British! kind kompromat might guy like Dr. Fauci..? California dude said many fucking things one bound right ffs get infection fatality rate numbers from, assume groups different fatality rates infected frequency? 75% best chances avoid complications get infected, herd immunity achieved significantly lower death toll. would say 10 times lower least, USA ship already sailed... However following OSHA rules result fines desiring deal extra regulations reasonable. forced back work

Forced? ... yes! If, balance, it‚Äôs best interests public government lie, government shouldn‚Äôt refrain lying sake telling truth. public need truth times would detrimental public interests? used talk smash mouth super underrated pop punk band deleted phone heard It‚Äôs like using chicken wire keep mosquitoes would like boat. get side ledger?  proto-you-know-who. yes please misinterpreted video provided functionally talking nonsense right now. I'm going bother citing N95s better, Google, assume. actually read article, explains N95s better, per Duke University. 

For one brief second thought clueless passing misinformation unintentionally. longer case. amazes willing, jubilantly eager, age demographic comes shaming others social media placing anonymous call help prevent potential disaster violation code ethics? Like lift finger might look good reputation hesitate second publicly smearing someone else.

edit, say every age demographic, social shaming pandemic That‚Äôs really crux it. isn‚Äôt enough go around, classroom get one bottle last month. That‚Äôs nearly enough classroom. thousands classrooms like it. we‚Äôre taking thousands bottles sanitizer away places like nursing homes, piss away completely ineffectual manner classrooms. people schools nursing homes come worse scenario. It‚Äôs ridiculous sickening (literally).

I hope family okay. We‚Äôre resigned super poor time being. husband school, able buy insurance university. literally none schools safe enough, DEATH PLAGUE KILLED GRANDPA Thiele sure another kind ‚Äúanimal‚Äù poised rampage hospital looking drugs. later recalled wondering time: ‚ÄúWhat would do, crazy black people think they‚Äôve oppressed years white people¬†‚Ä¶¬†God knows crazy people outside going poor patients dying. dismember them, rape them, torture them.‚Äù

this nothing people study even say so

Exactly. Everything outlined methodology. statistical analysis sound. conclusion based statistical analysis. find anything already blatantly That's literally exactly I'm saying

No wasn't. thought find gotcha argument study also tested family members, small sample set. Nothing said even remotely implied conclusive proof (which seem arguing against). merely brought evidence possible cross effects, it. evidence - suggests possible correlation. That's whole /r/iamverysmart tirade study flawed completely misses mark. arguments already stated authors study, negate results, merely means take study grain salt.

You know else? took literally 30 seconds google scholar find 100+ references study, including larger 1000 person followups failed reproduce results. Notice even bother assuming answers. know else did? read followup studies realized evidence cross-effects, evidence against. launch tirade attacking studies unscientific, agree beliefs. 

Science complicated. Statistics complicated. ok nuanced results agree other. acknowledge evidence supporting conclusion, evidence supporting it. That's science done sorry makes uncomfortable. Wondering said jab somebody love. definition herd immunity thin herd  4 people died bikes Sturgis year. could saved **5** lives cancelling rally altogether. Kristi Noem murderer 5 times letting people rally. safety others via light paper cloth mask extenuating circumstances ‚Äúoppressive rule‚Äù. 

Wear mask selfish oafs. DHS sent guantanamo. sounds like boss really, really banking Republicans getting liability protections passed. Directly instructing employees **not** wear safety equipment middle pandemic fucking liability nightmare. amazed legal signed policy without pushback. makes sad. Yes freedom, mean dumb things said freedom say every part US response.  lol mean, does. says title article - ""Refusal"" wear mask linked sociopathy, simply act failing wear one.

The study looking people refuse wear masks even advised government told risks failing wear one. government instead telling country free new cases, la New Zealand, reason *to* wear mask - saving anyone's health, linked sociopathy. Comply else   blacklist stuff like, now? Yeah, would employ you. buy you. retirement US work?

Here Belgium 13.07% gross goes social things basically.

Sick leave, people injured/handicapped, vacation money, pensions, etc.

So believe 67 days(might different depending job, construction workers expected work till 67) begin receiving money.

The thing is, government really uphill battle, need another lockdown. apartment Boulder Creek costs like $1000/month quite bit cheaper dorms lmao. provide reason. N95 masks filter air coming out. meant worn environments like wood cutting, cement grinding, medical professionals need filter infected air.

The reason wearing masks COVID spread asymtomatically. Wearing mask filter air defeats entire purpose it. Think going dentist COVID. employees wearing n95 mask surgical mask also filter air (my dentist anyways). 

We also keeping n95 masks available medical professionals, need most. ideals dated since PPE supplies much stock before, 1 person 100 wearing n95 mask rest 99 people higher risk getting infected individual.

The whole ""my mask protects mask protects me"" mantra thrown people wear N95   exposed people flouting rules really bad effect mental health

Which interesting clearly relevant vaccine's overall efficacy protecting black women.

Obviously community level difference particular strains HPV carried transmitted among black women paper versus strains Gardasil vaccine covers.

But strains vaccine designed cover get coverage regardless race.

I think there's allegation black people carrying different strains SARS-CoV-2 population segments. gene sequencing various populations virus pretty aggressive.

Hopefully particular risk mitigated that.

Still, intriguing paper fascinating difference HPV strains across different racial communities. Replaced FDA career official. Good move. spread exponentially,

The spread infectious disease absolutely exponential. taken extreme public health interventions prevent this. entire point ""flattening curve."" Well, that's patently false. one bad prof. 

Try again. post pretty factual. show incorrect? Yeah, definitely feels like we're middle Dunning-Kruger extinction event right now. N95 masks one-way valves CDC released guidelines saying n95 masks effective preventing spread covid.

""Masks exhalation valves vents worn help prevent person wearing mask spreading COVID-19 others (source control)."" yet covid deaths covid outbreaks due protests.

So what? would never happened money wasnt involved saying accomplish that? Trump issued executive order giving authority apparently. Realistically I‚Äôm sure federal government authority - would think housing would be, broadly speaking, state issue. Guess that‚Äôs lawsuits figure out. Okay, really showed me. Thanks. Remember country jailed pregnant women posting something protest would take place. Alright DHS politicized point disbanded...  sort good news? going possible cases, especially sending home cars.

Why would COVID death someone diabetes count towards total? announcement would come October 15 overpromise November 1. Also, people including Costco employees often wear fucking mask fucking nose makes entire discussion irrelevant. pandemic started worked target. forbid us wearing masks weeks. That‚Äôs COVID. also weren‚Äôt allowed take time sick. Right time election! Full steam ahead! article unfortunately still misleading focus pre-exisiting conditions.

The authors discuss fact 94% statistic includes pre-existing conditions immediate causes death caused COVID-19 (like respiratory failure, pneumonia, cardiac arrest), misleading focus report expands knowledge pre-existing conditions add risk.

The 94% statistic *does tell us ANYTHING* prevalence pre-existing conditions COVID-19 deaths, combines pre-existing conditions immediate causes. thing tells us 6% death certificates failed include immediate causes death (and always present COVID-19 deaths). shame CDC decided highlight meaningless statistic could simply provided calculated prevalence pre-existing conditions instead. really going make people want get vaccine, they‚Äòve started phase 3. keep kids campus quarantining.

So day comes. People edge. Everyone‚Äôs telling everyone else they‚Äôre walking out. Everyone‚Äôs edge.

I bet usual winter flu deaths listed covid deaths justify fascist measures, won‚Äôt end people stop going along them. 

It wouldn‚Äôt bad covid actually deadly. Tests per positive case : GER : 114 ; USA : 16 (data August)

 

GER test positivity rate week no. 33 : 0.96% US positivity rate week no.34 : 5.7%

(  )

( )

Do wanna say problem. RKI boss worried test positivity risen 0.5 0.96%. look figures closely see US outbreak outpaced testing capacity. CDC narrowing testing criteria testing asymptomatics, RKI expanding criteria get ahead asymptomatic spread testing asymptomatic risk groups multipliers. Currently trying mobilize vet labs ramp testing.

I hope get better US, though. *sees source, ignores.* sub obsessed event? isn‚Äôt 1918 haven‚Äôt noticed. Medicine progressed significantly since then. want go back 102 years?

It‚Äôs like dgaf dies why. It‚Äôs unnecessary don‚Äôt care.

Maybe that‚Äôs herd immunity like anti-maskers sociopaths. sounds like sociopathic thinking me. America OK teachers kids get do, take care hospital meant widely available then.

Historians agree hand fist Hitler's Germany anything organized ordered. put show order parades fear. Shit, even Blitzkrieg nothing meth-driven blind charge chaos. Hitler said it, French put *even tiniest* resistance opening invasion, would've collapsed. 

The actual management bureaucracy governing Nazi Germany chaotic, could change wind, generally speaking pretty much insanity. opposite governance. 

The higher went up, less ordered ""try upset Fuhrer way, shape form, even lucky suspect opponent hiding"". high treated whoever superior fashion. SS SD held ultimate authority lieu Fuhrer. Entire groups soldiers (feared ones, even) held guilty commander fell favor: See Himmler SA. 

There simply way run nation fear team jackbooted soldiers whisking away night maintain reasonable notion ""order"". 

And that's wildly similar what's happening American government right now. 

If like reading material I'd happy back claims.  know get first ones, famous entertainers, political figures, families, lobbies friends. specific virus short antibody half-life, apparently reinfection early 6 months observed even Chinese numbers fishy, fishy. maybe actually valid data. No, can't be, data comes evil chinese, must faked clever way pass Benford's law, noting authorities check faked numbers pass test together. Sneaky sneaky chinese again. whole article bunk. Here's DHS say schools, bottom page six instructions masks: rub recommends cloth masks. mention N95s all. Fox article referring specifically Whitefish Bay school district may forbidding use N95s, conflating absence recommendation N95 suggest Evers DHS pushing bunk science stating teachers wear N95s.

It's worth mentioning State Supreme Court Wisconsin (heavily Conservative) pushing really hard strip emergency mandates Evers (Democrat) pushed, defund DHS, remove woman presently charge it. Fox, know, pushes Conservative ideologies; another way twisting two unrelated stories throw shade governor. Yes, UK. UK America? Air traffic still 80% year year June. Even it‚Äôs 50% point that‚Äôs lot planes   Makes wonder people simply dumb really follow lied masks working beginning pandemic. guess haven‚Äôt learnt public‚Äôs trust compromised lie us. 

I swear global disease agencies operate like amateurs. ran CDC would made policy stock billions masks vital equipment, incase pandemic broke out.... People shut regardless government mandate It‚Äôs letter next name. republican governor New York‚Äôs response would‚Äôve torn shreds media Long term effects (can‚Äôt prove new virus whatever), appeals emotion (‚Äúdo want people die‚Äù), real kicker tons people actually gaining lot (totalitarian governments gaining control, tech companies running smaller competition business) anyone able find source DHS actually saying this? really seems like poor phrasing, like recommending cloth masks FOX saying wear n95. Also, link study instead quote. Also, article spends time talking Whitefish Bay prohibit n95 though trying shift blame onto DHS Evers. horrendously written article Yes. That's hospitals around required I've appointments. Honestly, we'd right now. He's really walking sound bite left wing news social media sites like one. links better cloth masks? +1 ü§£ Yeah huge jump think covid.

It could really been, would caused huge outbreak happen.

As well covid would rarely kill miners 40ies.

It covid, somethibg else doctor manage diagnose. dude definitely coming alternate accounts vote manipulating. Lol. don‚Äôt care they‚Äôre liars bastards. cares you? might prove biggest mistake yet Also better overall health average. agree probably thinks masks dumb/unnecessary.

And thats hes selfish asshole.

Next! plenty states instituted mandatory stay home orders ... what? 

The problem patchwork half-assed measures meaningful federal coordination. 50 states simultaneously issued mandatory stay home orders, *very* narrow definition constitutes ""essential"" activity, think we'd rather different situation. Instead got worst worlds. Wow.. Queensland Australia back April three weeks prepare online learning issues new normal... pretty sure forgot notify Microsoft Australian children would using one note first weeks backup plan horror. area mostly returned normal, exception people wearing masks. initial release ready immediately upon approval. 50 million used mostly America, would assume. A-Z probably 100 million produced end year results indicate antiviral antibodies SARS-CoV-2 decline within 4 months diagnosis. estimate risk death infection 0.3% want remind fantasist customers might get sick. Chinese Defense Bots activated, prepare downvoting bans.  N95 surgical mask it. Hey know you‚Äôre pretty simple minded outsider takes quick numbers agrees, I‚Äôll try fix you. 
300,000 people, 6,000 sturgis residents tested... 260 positive. Yes that‚Äôs 6%, tested, probably doubled time waiting results.
That‚Äôs small population sturgis. 300,000 tested, many articles states concluding cases traced back sturgis rally. 
Enjoy lil enlightenment. pointing idea you‚Äôre BLUE, want vaccine save everyone watch (which could post nov 3rd). you‚Äôre RED, want immediately boost polls.

Who's asshole? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* nothing lighthearted deadly desease thats killed 200,000.

This gross.

I answered question already. heard making effective vaccine Coronavirus nearly impossible

Whoever said know they're talking about. Two things keep mind:

1. COVID inherently difficult disease vaccinate against. mutate rapidly chronic infection. existing vaccine tech, question effective if.

2. several candidates already Phase III trials. Contrary popular belief, vaccine candidates make PIII succeed (I believe like 86 percent I'm mistaken). probably would upwards million deaths projections... Agreed points. things likely factor case comes up. lot cases likely get thrown out. likely employer acted bad faith, purposefully disregarded state guidelines, unnecessarily put employees risk (or even worse, got exposed, sickened, even killed).

As service industry, somewhat mixed bag there. example, ways adapt service dangers pandemic. Restaurants adapted, kept employees payroll converting ones drive delivery drivers. re-arranged seating better foster social distancing...have implemented policies protect employees customers (masks waitstaff, thorough cleaning table rotations, curbside delivery/takeout, etc).

I mean, measures painful degree everyone involved. reason remain effect pandemic way out. things employers doing, especially stage game. ones still wrong things, need encouraged stop wrong things, necessary, taken court resolve.

Each case unique, context set circumstances.  saw ""expert"" say going end 70% population Covid heard immunity. true wearing masks trying slow inevitable? angst masks??? hospitals everything place, ventilators, occupancy down, worry? IFR 25% people least affected 1/20,000 range. would around 5k total US deaths achieve herd immunity. 

All deaths tragedies younger death especially so. age bracket would already prefer ignore pandemic. IFR lowest risk bracket comparable risk taking road trip. 

The fact (and was) impossible obviously issue. Can't wait WW3 end 30s! cop pretty safe job. Heart disease kills wayyy cops criminals Mike Pompeo pushed theory April early May. Reputable scientists -- around world -- refuted claim numerous times. Since then, Pompeo backed away. guy photo... can't even get someone smart enough get collage wear mask right ... despair. species survived long many can't learn??? Actually follow thread article spaces, one things they've poking at.

That is, COVID-19 disproportionately effects *working-class* people ""professional class"" safely locked away home. think saw somewhere too. understanding 50 million available immediately, could several hundred million produced new year. April please remove  use mobile thanks. 250,000 Companies don‚Äôt want ostracize possible customers. Politicians don‚Äôt want ostracize potential voters. Money, greed, ‚Äòme.‚Äô Hey, heard morons going go ahead rally, fine it. I've thinking picking nice discounted bike, something estate sale. plenty around depress prices. Hose Clorox, would fine.  Probably wise disinfect anyway whether Covid play. mean, bikers. expect better administration point? every time see outrage wish still energy. Also countries relaxed quarantine early. already ""unacceptable"" couple weeks Labor Day pick stronger word. Um, no, article says ***at all***.

‚ÄúFauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said trusts independent members DSMB ‚Äî government employees ‚Äî hold vaccines high standards without politically influenced. Members board typically experts vaccine science biostatistics teach major medical schools.‚Äù

Dr Fauci quoted saying ***if vaccine shows exceptional results*** would release full stage three trial period ***which standard practice*** whenever cure vaccine shown safe (Stage One Stage Two) Stage Three (proven work) shows exceptional efficacy.

In fact considered unethical to.

They still proceed Stage 3 collect data; would allow given save lives.

That‚Äôs agenda: saving American lives.
 
What‚Äôs yours? lol reason believe wearing mask NZ, literally count fingers many new cases per day, moral equivalent war crime? people go grain wear one NZ also sociopaths.

How sociopathic wish keep people catching contagious diseases have? Checked links again. 

I found information even began answer question chance dying next year group. sure talking about. even looked links linked people case got conversations mixed up. 

To clear I‚Äôm saying this. 


1. Mortality rate overall catch Covid chance dying Covid. 

2. Saying 1 96 deaths due self poisoning(including overdoes). saying someone 1.03% chance dying accidental poisoning. source says explicitly opening paragraph also. 

3. None statistics answers question chances healthy non drug using 30 year old male dying next 365 days. number changed Covid. 

4. finally ignores rest negatives Covid death. 

Since beginning issue never chance dying due Covid proper medical care available. 

It keep medical care available, treat, prevent. 

Looking mortality rate disease medical care available almost meaningless worrying medical care isn‚Äôt available. issue Covid runs rampant exhaust capabilities medical facilities. mortality rate Covid increase quite exponentially also increase deaths many normally preventable disease injuries. Looking mortality rate perfect example missing forest trees. obtain herd immunity, 70%+ population would need infected, we're what, 4%-5%?..Herd immunity option unless wanna wait number years millions dead people chance actually happening. Reddit Enhancement Suite desktop! Seems far fetched think anyone would that.

Seens likely natural virus. There's reason be. TFW category 1 want guinnea pig universe's rushed vaccine üòï Newsweek used somewhat respectable publication, devolved pure click bait tabloid. say first time locked up? Always thoughts students traveling back homes, shutting family strange idea.  n95 masks filter coming breath, incoming. selfish beyond belief. bought late January still decent supply. know site says discontinued believe mentioned stock issue. wrong, good luck people strong feelings want assign blame solely either irresponsible students feckless administrators. put things perspective: Currently US 1000 corona deaths per day. means population 400k people, 1.2 deaths per day average. So, 1 death, 1.2 deaths every day. 

Of course demographic entire country, probably different event, still gives perspective big outbreak we're talking here. 

For confirmed cases, US currently 30k new confirmed cases per day. population 400k means 36 cases per day. So, we're talking event lasted 10 days, 260 number slightly lower taken random sample 400k people US observed many cases 10 days. mean like Mueller investigating Trump?
lemons! lemons! come buy lemons!

This guy _in_ Trump administration ‚ÄúCDC urgently requests assistance expediting applications distribution facilities and, necessary, asks consider waiving requirements would prevent facilities becoming fully operational November 1, 2020,‚Äù CDC wrote Aug. 27 letter state governors one saying don't? right doctor see without telehealth interview determine whether really need person visit, scrips get filled phone, go need wear mask, pass screener questionnaire, get temp scanned door, talk everyone besides doctor thick layer plexiglass. 

Also regularly change kids urine soaked clothing. job? I'd vote could. guess I‚Äôm disconnected hospitals empty I‚Äôll give that. project ~ 6% people infected kids, infected others school, going die. terms missed wages, missing parents going hurt household economics much keeping schools closed. I... said believe numbers faked.

Just passing particular test mean anything. Like many statistical tests, *failure* stands out. believe numbers correct (and they're probably correct numbers anywhere), logical say, ""These Benford distribution, therefore they're fake."" Agreed - I've really productive able tackle bunch projects otherwise able do.  Yeah closest know, RaTG13 big genetic difference covid still. 

I mean humans gorillas also 96% similarity. still, (well extinct) lot steps humans gorillas.

So thinking closer relatives 96% there, I'd want like 99,7 % similarity think maybe point origin.

IDK viruses chane huge chunks dna fast though. think 4 % change represent long time. Ask fellow officer's families that. See wives say. understand backlash either. seems reasonable effective distribution plan network established enough time cushion logistics hold getting vaccine out. would rather hammer details months advance hobbling together last minute like testing network issues. Chances pretty low actually get infection possibility there. Fancy Nancy Pelosi perhaps ? Tbh, Smash Mouth hardest part beleive, rest could low key see coming miles away. Listen.. agree lockdown protest anti mask people.. find least bit concerning? Arresting facebook post? seems like good bit reaching me. mississippian can't can? FUCKING LOVE KF94!

The KN95 okay, N95 give always stiff press ears, hurts. 

But KF94? even feel them. really good, cover underchin, mouth nose, comfortable fuck. Maybe push masks full sociopaths. (Obviously something believe personally let‚Äôs take ridiculous premise it‚Äôs obvious conclusion)

There's difference panic alert. kids getting spreading it, need change plan that's see articles. swept rug places people end going news. People need aware outbreaks. Even places online virtual, outbreaks. many students totally removed environment, still outbreaks. would everyone decided send kids back school? 

Parents needing life go back normal vaccine effective treatment. need listen experts quit rolling eyes safety measures. Yep - college friend told yesterday younger sister, who‚Äôs first grade teacher, student test positive. quarantined children sat six feet away longer 15 minutes. sister asked get tested and/or quarantine, school leadership strongly encouraged continue coming work. Yes, administering rushed vaccine political reasons. Remind me! 4 months virus soon endemic rest world, like 5 6 coronavirus colds. So, NZ lock forever? achieved postponement, prevention. And, postponement caused additional suicides, divorce, delayed cancer diagnoses, bankruptcies, etc.

(Note, vaccine coronavirus colds, may one this. Also, risk rushed-through vaccine could problematic.)

BTW: surprised see may agree likelihood (not certainty) HCQ efficacy, although since fear-monger John Campbell says it, would start doubt it. perfect educator people need least-nutritious data spoon-fed them. watch John Campbell, mainly stay echo chamber. repeatedly managed convince right, lot cherry-picking data. Obviously. saying. That's true.

US govt pre purchases 100M option buy 500M more. pre manufacturing mean sitting ready day approved. reading around seems like increase chance certain complications , overall decrease mortality rate per current studies. Dr Hahn FDA hinted would quit vaccine release politicized fails meet safety requirements. that‚Äôs true; need watch that. Republicans wear face masks... need link Kevin Bacon. matter; available us. dismiss see causes approval.

I was, however, willing phase 3 trial vaccines, I'm really scared general. I'd like know effective get one outside trial. Millions would likely vaccinated I'd chance be, though, I'd time decide.

""LOOK, SAFE GUYs, WERENT SAFE, WE'D WEAR MASKS!"" Trump make booboo, hurt country.

That‚Äôs shortest make it. hey little fella, don‚Äôt fret, gets better.

Not dead cops, I‚Äôm sure matter much matter Trump. Winter 2022 going give us Baby Boomer generation 2.0, many kids born... actually find eBay got 20 pack couple weeks ago think going see split people different economic outlooks. economic collapse horrible, feel awful everyone affected, small percentage economy, like 11% people unemployed. real impact closer 30%, still means 70% kept working (while less things spend money also saving money precaution fear job loss). many 30% impacted got expanded unemployment benefits, many actually made making working. Add $1,200 stimulus second one almost certainly coming soon, think average person going disposable money pandemic before, could completely line here. think see roaring 20's economic type boom followed historic recession/depression inevitable given many underlying economic issues society. could wrong though, observations led think. Sweden one highest fatality rates per population planet.

The nations fared worse thus far nations Western Europe hit earlier harder, plus Peru Brazil (Trumplandia sul).  one European nations UK, initially took approach Sweden late.

Sweden failed miserably. Read article. question see ask trust CDC telling truth director says ‚Äúthe licensing waivers compromise safety integrity products distributed.‚Äù

I want to, I‚Äôm skeptical. Eejits ""Make America Great Again"", uhmmm, America's ended great again? country fire, literally. virus, countries control, killing hundreds thousands Americans. rich getting richer, poor getting poorer. Inflation greatly outpacing raise wages, benefits employees quickly diminishing. department education already lagging behind countries, getting worse. divide middle class due race economics fueled president leading revolution second american war. America sucks. people suck, hate here. Flights actually among safer things do, ironically, especially flight limited capacity. I‚Äôd hesitant say things okay masks. It‚Äôs obvious use them, there‚Äôs substitute physical distance brains get smart heads get dumb. first child die age 5 without pre-existing medical condition. Likely sign come schools reopening. too. Mental health spiraled far around people gives anxiety locking down. Oh, irony. Get troll scary picture people think behave. *sounds* right, framed certain way, ergo ...it must right! let's vehemently defend opinion demand change cast expert organizations doubt! like pieces shit told employees wtc go back desk everything fine. Never listen people, they're smarter you. Better yet, they‚Äôre also elementary school teacher. Jesus fucking Christ comment highly upvoted positive story? almost like auto posted random. N95s vents designed protect comfortable, masks right primarily (but also) prevent mask wearer infecting others. future historians come looking archived threads predecessors, hope gives good laugh. Yes, that‚Äôs plan do: offer folks placebo. Teachers insist provided N95s every day. amazing demanding it, understandable people actually access due mismanagement. 

If continues next school year, see teachers provided N95 supplies return. wear fucking retail job every customer facing position n95s Agree, desire damage tenant (contrary popular opinion here). bet don‚Äôt collect rent pay something move out, decent reference rent new place afford. clean house either move back sell another owner. I'm actually curious education under. One would expect student general knowledge every single country world over, perhaps highlight major bodies question.

So look like AUS? students expected leave school understanding sampling world powers(China, US, Russia, Germany, etc.) along understanding local political bodies SE Asia? say ""a distant relative"" accurate. RaTG13 closest known relative SARS-CoV-2.

And authors course spend great deal time addressing exact point quickly remaining bit viral evolution happen, specifically referencing numerous studies demonstrate accelerated evolution adaptation new host species. Well guess you‚Äôre disconnected hospitals.

Pulling 3,000 state doctors nurses help beyond capacity ICU‚Äôs overwhelmed.

Moving nurse patient ratios overwhelmed.

Working doctors 60 hours week overwhelmed.

It‚Äôs people dying streets might think, it‚Äôs still system well beyond capacity. certain federal testing response would significantly better given priority, manpower resources CDC pretty good getting estimates. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll revised later excess deaths probably way right Ah, got it. Sho terrifying. think First Amendment would still protect instance.

As claim First Amendment protect everything, someone yell ""fire"" crowded theater, exactly person singled crowded room? missed part fits orangemanbad narrative. That's newsworthy reddit. Except hear bantered ways. Nobody fucking clue willing use kids test subjects schools. schools opened already close constant rolling quarantine. Hello, fellow Pole!

Personally, can't bear sight pseudo-face masks commonly worn cashiers Poland. nose-mask covers one's nose mouth seems like useless invention! guess. That's literally is. can't anything else, possible. may well thought out, calculated, educated guess, still guess. 

The FACT is, assuming deaths caused covid solely covid. sort examination determine guys heart attack guys stroke fact caused covid. this, factually inaccurate state died covid. There's way around it. worry, nasty clusters eventually break spread nicely students leave colleges head back home can't herd immunity reinfected virus. immune short period time recover Covid-19. time become reinfected it. suppose herd immunity going work? I'm trying rude, I'm really curious. totally be, children get sick covid grown ups thought they‚Äôd exceed Sweden‚Äôs per capita numbers especially comments point kid exposed tested send school getting results back Oh, plenty weird respiratory diseases there. go favorite university library pick book pathology respiratory diseases.

But guess aiming know SARS MERS already? Well, scale issue. SARS MERS less cases total worldwide US Covid-19 deaths... like order magnitude less. data secondary long term effect SARS MERSE much less potentially Covid-19. Anything affects one 1000 would lead 8-10 cases SARS, worldwide. Covid-19 several 100 country. Liver Matter

Great name band. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs people saying‚Äù Denied


Anyone mirror c&amp;p? We've this, COVID-19 *worse seasonal flu*. That's there's big effort contain it. localists lost. wanted bait mainland massacring instead smothered heavy foot bureaucracy. that's left conspiracy theorists aligned elements US right calling coronavirus chinese hoax. continuous testing. not, makes difference. Schools closed environment. 12 days waiting time, absolutely completely useless  strawman, nobody actually supports view ""... we're glad stay lab give expertise there."" 

Yup. company building GMP facility right now. made *very* clear want nothing it. 

It's two totally different skill mind sets. That's collosally bone-headed CDC make kits. Design kits? Hell, yes. Manufacture them? God, feel current administration would screw sort vaccine distribution?

...

Oh wait. too! school system trained that? 1st 6th grader get call EVERY single sneeze cough pick up. counties schools play shit. going common story lie dogs you‚Äôre gonna get fleas. lol US become meme wonder upvotes coming people think joking, ones think seriously believe that. think realize saying. would say people HK somewhat concerned considering what's going behind lot political moves there. 

This concern morons US really stupid squared. 94% pre-existing conditions. results virus like respiratory failure. America drink bong water, dude. went pizza place Murdo called Prairie Pizza way Pierre. make crust cinnamon roll (not pizza part, crust). don‚Äôt know why. ate it. Wasn‚Äôt bad.

I guess I‚Äôm saying pretty much know everything South Dakota.

Edit: also went place called Fryn‚Äô Pan Sioux Falls. Walleye first time liked it. Asked group old people directions falls started polite argument ever. test positive virus, contact tracing symptoms :D 184K, that's obviously low. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs already queued deletion mods segregate 60 60 older then? Nobody see parents grand parents teachers aunts uncles older friends. Stick em home lock door guess.

Yeah, subsidize elderly SS Medicare, ignore fact paid system 40-50 years more... make sound like they're leeches never contributed.

And death thing concerned with. There's lots health conditions otherwise healthy people get COVID. resi construction increased 23% July sales general picking up. Resi market red hot general

Those month-over-month changes, housing highly seasonal. Year-over-year much reliable indicator. Existing home sales July last year, big jump - 8% IIRC? much due lower interest rates much due generally improving economic conditions, hard companies beating earnings calls big ways contrary news outlet reporting state broader economy

Companies S&amp;P 500. sense small businesses well, overall really sector-specific, although I'd interested see data showing broader trend. declined April time jobless claims continue fall

I hope fallen given catastrophic things looking earlier. ISM, PMI, regional Fed surveys also expanding again, good, again, fell cliff. We're effectively making lost output. also serious delinquency rates mortgages hitting highs last seen housing bubble, travel hospitality sectors still shambles.

I'm hopeful recovery continue, I'm also sure think working class especially well now.

BTW, following indicators probably know this, [Calculated Risk great resource tracking contextualizing data releases. Georgia's seeing now, decline slower Arizona many people wear masks without mandate. may tracking policies guidelines reflect all. keep claiming young healthy people go back work school there's little risk dying getting hospitalized. masks often required. mom tested positive today showing symptoms. came 10 days ago dropped food stuff. partner minimal contact wore masks highly doubt we‚Äôre flying across country go spend week national park 3 days. We‚Äôre waitlist get rapid test they‚Äôre still super accurate. would do? hard believe literally millions child deaths, far cases be, spreading disease farther population, percent die percent lasting problems result. 

When Trump said we'd much winning realize meant he'd giving Darwin awards everybody. country ever control like 2.30am alerts loud enough wake whole house? ""God's will."" excess deaths aren‚Äôt guess all. would unprecedented dramatic jump deaths time period. Expected deaths overall specific causes surprisingly consistent. anything sheer volume excess deaths points undercounting COVID deaths. 

I guess dealing somebody thinks doctors national level improperly/unethically jobs; doubt amount facts change opinion. material Hi Texas schools reopened weeks normal start date many people basically none government think hoax #‚ÄùDOWNWARD‚Äù. wait people bring fact pharmaceutical companies financially exempt injury deaths related vaccines, bill passed Reagan less. people I‚Äôve seen harping ‚Äúsee, scam!‚Äù idiots said stop listening CDC everyone else. like bc agrees (though doesn‚Äôt). Like literal cave people. stumbled across months ago. entire NYT piece site talks about. must understand PCR test works thinks sensitive

""So PCR corona test immune person, virus detected, small shattered part viral genome. test comes back positive long tiny shattered parts virus left. Correct: Even infectious viruses long dead, corona test come back positive, PCR method multiplies even tiny fraction viral genetic material enough [to detected]. That‚Äôs exactly happened, global news, even shared WHO, 200 Koreans already went Covid-19 infected second time therefore probably immunity virus. explanation really happened apology came later, clear immune Koreans perfectly healthy short battle virus. crux virus debris registered overly sensitive test therefore came back ‚Äúpositive‚Äù.¬†******It likely large number daily reported infection numbers purely due viral debris.******
The PCR test extreme sensitivity initially perfect find virus could be. test identify whether virus still alive, i.e. still infectous. Unfortunately, also led virologists equate strength test result viral load, i.e. amount virus someone breathe out. Luckily, day care centres stayed open nontheless. Since German virologist missed part, because, principle, look countries doing, even countries‚Äô case numbers falling obviously detached alternative points view pointless conversation. 

We're fucked all. We'll fine. blind realize I've never facebook.... quoted CDC statistics quoted Come on. That‚Äôs bullshit knows it. There‚Äôs way know 190k would alive today. say dumb shit lose credibility matter side you‚Äôre on. next couple decades went splendidly like 5 million public school children Texas, plus university students. 0.1% thousands cases. Onesie-twosies per **district** hardly end world.

inb4 downvotes Question......how u know 3times bad flu still going on???? Last heard friend, we‚Äôre working 3 days hear test results UK, wtf 12 days?! I'm happy today I‚Äôm assuming infection Nevada aberration. rule. Lol, nice debate guys. Looks like gave pissing match get last word xD workplaces? noes. see places closing layoffs effects uncontrolled disease spread. places lay offs permanently closing ones allowed business. Even supposed lockdown 1 1/2 weeks almost everything open. slow compared countries? work there, too. Hope you‚Äôre surviving craziness, technology, constant changes! health care system? Yes there‚Äôs evidence specific ACE protein nose virus bonds less prevalent children, something like that. Whether matters much proven, something look at. flu deaths *lower* expected likely deaths *misattributed covid* 

Meaning covid *overcounted* pandemics ended prior vaccines? course herd immunity local back much international travel. Yes!!! coming say would much rather keep seat 5 hours day done 30 min live academic lessons entire day. I'm fact, older daughter middle school working great her. clearly optimal, gets plenty breaks move around eat lunch recess learning ton. least they're forced chair 5 hours day there's chance might learn something. tell fact nothing meaningful learned 30 minutes live academic lessons day. child taught read that's big problem. thing Mexico. Get tested, get results day. mom teaches CFISD I'm worried her. I'm sorry Texas sucks fucking much. two statements contradictory well.

Contradictory mean ""opposite"", also mean ""incongruous"" 1. Mutually opposed 1.1 Containing elements inconsistent conflict. Take time! point past months, there's still idea Sweden things differently reality early weeks March April. Ever since hard lockdown ended policy rest Europe largely Sweden (except mandatory masks) audience

You spelt wants money wrong. /s countries opened school shown kids **don't** spread staff. staff may give though. Shocking!!!! respiratory viruses risk causing aforementioned ailments well myocarditis? seasonal influenza known coronaviruses potential cause well?

Edit: nevermind. answered question. Myocarditis known complication influenza well. talking heads leaders stop pushing rushed vaccine. Afraid 6% nothing wrong still died. Cool story dumb dumb Sorry, marked sarcasm.. plenty places live worse US. CoronaVac (Sinovac), Unnamed (Sinopharm/Wuhan), BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm/Beijing) Phase III, several works.  Hear, hear. would give disgruntled people Earth chance find new frontier stake claim better life. states also protecting foreclosure. Oregon extended ban day end year. Meanwhile eviction moratorium still due end month. Tooooo bad guess actual reality. nothing empathy. everything arguments right thinks left insane. keep pressing free shit less personal responsibility. Meanwhile us left think everyone healthcare education need equality fight climate change left dealing bullshit fallout crazies. 

I hope you, that's I'm saying. choices live consequences. Stay home sick, stop treating teachers like daycare. Trade nations fine. Subordinating interests not. issue years ago could say allergies anxiety ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èbut worth getting checked know happens assume virus literally everything think of, behaves incredibly strangely.

And people still believe jumped bats wet market that‚Äôs around years. 

It‚Äôs clearly lab made. Actually organizing, person, improper safety protocols illegal. Chatting facebook illegal. do, trust me. I'd gladly take vaccines currently Phase III concerns regarding safety.

What getting at, hope agenda discredit vaccine might benefit someone politically. people never actually ok dying, almost one is, self preservation base human instinct. I'd love ask people say shit like they're still worried dying they're gasping air getting intubated, I'd bet they'd singing different tune moment. close calls life, thing racing entire body survive, nobody says shit actual danger. Exactly, feel like fit in, maybe even little heroic they've good socially distancing due decades practice. sadly would love never ended. review paper bring studies buried light. Then, something 6% civil deaths Covid.

What insanely ignorant position.

0% HIV deaths HIV. Seems like solved epidemic logic. Congrats. Africa surely appreciative.

And Herpes kill anyone. Guess stop worrying too. Vatican? haven‚Äôt flu long remember. I'm turning him. I'm blindly trusting him. like said beginning masks necessary changed mind later admitted said avoid mask shortage, clearly agenda then. Who's say agenda now. 

So, yeah I'm going blindly trust wait information decide weather safe. thing masks, thats decided wear mask even saying necessary What‚Äôs that‚Äôs endangering others? He‚Äôs wearing mask socially distancing. read aswell, couldnt find source stuck numbers seen source for. administration putting thumb scale. FDA allowed thing without interference would trust problem. administration allow federal bureaucracies jobs. interfered DOJ (Barr quashing case political ties, like Flynn), USPS (pulling sorting machines slowing mail delivery hamper vote mail middle pandemic), CDC (see revised guidelines implemented Fauci anesthesia walked back got wind it), NOAA (Sharpie hurricane), USDA (move Kansas DC losing 70% workforce) on.

What seeing consequences level interference. one trusts agencies allowed jobs overridden second anything conflicts Trump's agenda. like see egregious, forced NOAA change forecast know misspoke hurricane, tried back drawing map sharpie. rather simple ""whoops, sorry that, here's NOAA forecast"" he's completely incapable wrong try alter reality he'll admit simplest mistake.

Now surprised skeptical vaccine good chance he's leaning FDA skip trials science justifies desperately needs able claim victory election.

This elect pathological liar. trust scientists job, trust political hacks administration sideline scientists political expediency. still working hospital, I'd bring lunch eat outside! Alone. understanding contents implications report.

The report find protests spread COVID. found protests major cities *caused people stay inside* *overall effect* protests spread COVID balanced out.

Let's say 10,000 people marching streets. rioting, looting, violence, police/protester clashes, general disarray 40,000 people stay home otherwise wouldn't. *overall* spread COVID would mitigated increased numbers people self-isolating. report found.

Los Angeles *did* experience spike cases protests, days denying protests contribution Mayor Garcetti finally admit yes, did.

Garcetti ""I talked Dr. Ferrer morning,"" Garcetti said, referencing Dr. Barbara Ferrer, L.A. County public-health director. ""She think spread come protests""

Things simple clear-cut might want be.  Culling herd They‚Äôre going give citizens government officials unless they‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs safe 6% 185k deaths covid19. They‚Äôre also defining ‚Äúheart damage‚Äù include inflammation, self-limiting resolve own. Agree. would rather die pay absurd prices care. I've lived enough fucked world anyway. I'm good. likely something that‚Äôll work potentially negatively affect varying degree isn‚Äôt helping cause loved working home. Slept much better without stress. Got done faster without useless office schmoozing. Fuck hate back office reason company pays desk want filled. Fuck, hope not. They're even news! Even change filters better anything else?

Like yeah, actually want N95 performance shave scruff proper fit tests that, stick expired N95 sloppily face still probably better random cloth one. 22 year old, can‚Äôt imagine inconsiderate others. hate online school much anyone, Jesus Christ it‚Äôs worth killing people. would expect football players heart issues actually. likely know it. Vitamine G that. reason average nfl player lives 59 years. govt initially downplayed mask importance. didn‚Äôt want rush medical professionals unprotected.

Same reason initially said quarantine would weeks month... prevent societal panic. remember, still likely widely available approved n95 would keep wearing make fire wearing better mask recommend. explore lawsuit wrongful termination  RemindMe! 4 months wore mask say videoed changing filters tell videoed it. say fired you. Would able take court wrongful dismissal? ask for?

For something high potential killing people, starters. mention drug: ‚Äòthey tried one study, one showed: ‚Äú‚ÄôNational Institutes Health (NIH) announced launching outpatient trial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) azithromycin treatment ofCOVID-19. month later, agency announced closing trial lack enrollment 20 2000 patients recruited.‚Äù

That's HCQ trials halted fraudulent Lancet study later retracted:

[""WHO temporarily halts trial hydroxychloroquine safety retracts paper halted hydroxychloroquine article also two drugs ‚Äúexpected impart greater benefit.‚Äù better ‚ÄúMay‚Äù

Here studies Zinc SARS-CoV antibiotic, actually antiviral shown AZM significant antiviral properties. contrast CQ HCQ, antiviral activity shown vitro and/or vivo large panel viruses: Ebola, Zika, respiratory syncytial virus, influenzae H1N1 virus, enterovirus, rhinovirus [4‚Äì13]. activity respiratory syncytial virus demonstrated randomized study infants [10]. __Azithromycin exhibited synergistic antiviral effect SARS-CoV-2 combined HCQ vitro [11] clinical setting__ [13]. note, pre-print version article Andreani et al. [14] __also reported significant antiviral effect AZM alone SARS-CoV-2__. mechanisms antiviral effect AZM support large-spectrum antiviral activity. Azithromycin appears decrease virus entry cells [2, 8]. addition, enhance immune response viruses several actions. Azithromycin up-regulates production type III interferons (especially interferon-Œ≤ interferon-Œª), genes involved virus recognition MDA5 RIG-I [7, 12, 13, 15, 16]. mechanisms universally involved innate response infectious agents, potentially approved US Food Drug Administration 1955, used hundreds millions people worldwide since then, sold counter many countries, well-characterized safety profile raise undue alarm., Although asymptomatic QT prolongation well-recognized infrequent (&lt;1%) complication HCQ, possible setting acute illness symptomatic arrhythmias could develop. Data safety monitoring boards declared safety concerns clinical trial published date. Rare patients personal family history prolonged QT syndrome additional QT prolonging, contraindicated drugs (eg, dofetilide, sotalol) treated caution plan monitor QTc ambulatory setting. typical HCQ regimen 200 mg bid 5 days extended 30 days continued symptoms. minimal sufficient dose HCQ used, excessive doses drug interfere early immune response sure means: Data safety monitoring boards declared safety concerns clinical trial published date. known effects higher doses long term documented.

This means HCQ's dangerous side effects overblown, here's weekends death toll usa significantly lower days. understand low number cases might due less testing. come death toll falls 1.2k 300 weekends? missing? mostly personal experience plus experience younger staff.

I now, times preferable rent even buying affordable. wanted outsource home maintenance wanted flexibility relocate rapidly.

Some employees wanted flexibility. One employees whose remote year announced he's going make move Philly. basically non-event us he's remote. We're happy facilitate. kids days like bouncing around, apparently. doesn‚Äôt say that. says interview wears mask courteous others. It‚Äôs bad taste suggest don‚Äôt care die it. Read article interview script posting headline, it‚Äôs wrong Smh kids freaking selfish really makes sick. goodness sakes responsible. mask sort vent whatsoever, used *especially* employees. vent aimed means nothing. Ok, please enlighten us.

How wearing mask turn living existing? see found one shut-ins. Cool story bro. account ~~3~~200,000 excess deaths? history, we've also never worldwide effort much funding, several orders magnitude. unprecedented amount resources dedicated developing vaccines. I‚Äôve going months wear mask keep distance thing I‚Äôve got gainz I've never related article ever before. safe effective vaccine election, cares certain group *wanted* it?

Stop partisan start listening doctors. Also covid detected even milder cases noticed earlier counted causing CFR lower IFR remains mostly same. virus transmitted via droplets. Droplets much bigger virus. trolls hard today.

These confirmed cases. know, contact tracing US pretty dismal. We'll never know true extent spread due one event US.

The fact is, though, cases rising pretty quickly several great plains states right now. Like said we'll never know many cases connected, rise following event suspiciously closely. 

Also we've learned time time again, lesson seem sticking, contagious disease. takes week two people get sick enough get tested another week two get results back. Meanwhile spreading people take week two get tested another week two get results continues on. first wave people always small seems insignificant, like saw FL/TX/AZ/CA June, within another month exponentially more. Phase 3 finished yet. There's reason think clear. 

The threshold approval fairly low, 50% effectiveness reducing disease severity. believe threshold exceeded already trials prove it.

My expectation point Pfizer vaccine probably going around 75% effectiveness time first batch goes mass production. They'll keep improving recipe next year give us something work now.

This virus like flu mutates fast elude antibodies mutations. SARS variety slow mutators proven susceptible cross immunity coronavirus. easy make vaccine also hardest job we've tackled. one things we've done reasonably well flooding efforts money putting fast track. like population never heard N95 mask pandemic. There's lots situations N95 useful - especially construction, working around insulation &amp; fine wood dust. us N95 masks hand home shit requires them. 2019 lowest amount deaths per milion since start records, another user pointed yesterday. Cases declined measures taken. really additional measures, measures focusing long-term start. Anders Tegnell says immunity part it, possible say big impact moment. Herd immunity achieved not, strategy about. strategy values immunity, yes, **herd immunity** about. said since start herd immunity may result, count it. People Sweden (and do) actually practice social distancing. Believe not, recommendations enough people something Sweden. Sadly wasn‚Äôt talked possibility got home.. told thing, guess would put it.. covering vents material. probably super glue plastic part. 

I totally get vents vent breath, don‚Äôt think blue surgical mask require would better.. here‚Äôs hoping neither us anyone fly soon.. ""civil deaths""

What fuck even mean.

Just take moment, read much extra spin propaganda regurgitation using try make sound good. look layers frosting, realize scrape off, tiny piece cake inside made shit instead cake. wear one psych tech restraints patients. Sometimes working double shifts. also specifically says doesn‚Äôt want call people stupid wearing masks. Onto face? That'd work suppose government's responsibility, police's job, protect larger group individuals groups act harmful illegal manner.

Protesting order stay home put place protect community global pandemic selfish, stupid illegal. Philadelphian here. Kenney complete fuck mayor. great track record mayoral office particularly inept.

Assholish behavior like par course, along weak justification. really, around 55% stock, many small amounts indirectly mutual funds. top 10% around 85% market (figures Gallup 2020). idea regular folks America‚Äôs corporations supported facts. Yup, governor Illinois two cargo flights bring us ppe straight China. Lol HRP possibility! they're still M4A. 2019 drop exceptionally mild flu season - documented media scientists. meant far people old fragile group usually dies flu survived 2020. COVID-19, strong flu season, would extra deaths higher proportion fragile population (since become less fragile). 

I saying explains excess deaths COVID, explain bit them. received OSHA ""required"" training mask use particulate matter filtration employer. I'm engineer working manufacturing totally unrelated healthcare. get lung capacity test, learn fit fit test masks. 

I'm sure there's entirely different set OSHA guidance healthcare workers also guidance training requirements non-healthcare related use masks, respirators, etc. mistake. Yes - definition KN95s made China. yes latter also true. There's difference ticked off, attempted murder.

You say vandalism. much worse that. light house fire, endangering life, lives family, would call vandalism?

Also, Albertans violation laws. Vigilantism neighbours. Classy. politicians said exact opposite? Seriously dude, bubble? really cherish us live life somewhat free point. Many, many people continue kids lives halted ruined blunt measures like lockdowns.

What even arguing? Denmark differently calls bitterness towards Sweden? feel point butthurt Sweden isn‚Äôt hated poorly written american op-eds anymore.

And no: virus doesn‚Äôt *kill 0.5% people infects*, extremely misinformed idea. kills roughly 2-5% old sick, probably around 0.05% people 65. That‚Äôs reasonable measure, me, protect old frail. done Sweden many places debate, certainly think showed badly organized elder care hope lead lot resources sent way. make sense scheme. would insurance companies pay known? u/princess_hjonk gives answer that‚Äôs pretty good Moron. Considering claimed Daniel Andrews blames everyone else that's clearly false shows understand nothing. shows Nevada less Florida. doesn‚Äôt show trend isn‚Äôt true.

And again, comparing peak one kind mobility doesn‚Äôt tell shit.

Also multiple states listed high percentage checked Nevada.

Every argument make garbage ideologue.

If think supports you, it‚Äôs objectively true doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs false.


Pretty pathetic.

Feel free keep shoveling propaganda, find arguments pretty funny. lot doctors support person schooling (where safe). wear cheap cloth mask n95? Fuck idiotic rules. America backwards country. ruled corporate stooges political lackeys bringing whole world Make district give written statement can't wear N95. keep wearing it. give written statement sue. know Covid-19 causes kinds cardiovascular diseases including several lead multiple organ failures, degradation neural tissue, brain periphery, chronic degradation lung capacity blood oxigenation

Jesus... forgot pretty important key word here. **‚ÄùCAN.‚Äù** COVID19 *can* cause multitude problems even healthy patients.

For people, won‚Äôt. Yes, recovery stretches longer many infections, still occurs. reason assume non-critical cases going permanent issues, follow-up testing looks normal.

People responsible take seriously, also spread exaggerations. *common* disease. Many people it, many people (like me) loved ones sick. Please keep mind decide terrorize public armchair-science. read article? headline. said respects wearing mask always does, isn‚Äôt living scared personally. ask for? people can‚Äôt learn home. homes aren‚Äôt safe enough kids home day learn online. normal r/coronavirus fear mongering. might accidentally smear virus dirty stupid hands fucking pleb. get back work. Wonder gave anyone HERP. Agreed. It‚Äôs good question. think spread much effective urban areas shared ventilation, shared entrances exits etc. don‚Äôt know statistics makes sense rural populations able distance better. Omg ""Murica""

Cringe. also love someone brings cake everyone removes masks meeting they? Thought they‚Äôve delayed opening  Nah height comedy dies. It'd virus gives permanent lung damage ends whats left career started rumor spread French health minister. worst, incompetent person ever supervised ended DHS

In position? Without even clicking, know who's getting first doses- ain't us. stay home order effect since 11.59pm 2nd August.

Your confusion two issues makes seem though trying make kind point.

I'm going pretend kind authority Australians. wonderful mix races, cultures religions think differently. said, way things Australia pretend world's authority everything, shut listen sometimes often quick google searches things know decide weigh another country's legal system. Time strike, tbh. Lawsuits follow get sick work. Well might able hide fact you‚Äôre WHOR KUNT, HPV forever still catch eyes despite effective incoming air filtering. Trump messed country's virus response badly almost wonder intentional. We've known PPE shortages months Trump done absolutely nothing address problem whatsoever.  Damn, obviously got two confused due similar spelling/typos. talking plastic face shields also tiny face shields cover eyes. Let edit out. Thanks! REAL way fix problems anything colonise another planet, duh üòÇüòÇüòÇ Wow, first time noticed it, sure. news anymore, know. Ugh tired old republican talking points? GOING it? going band together decide essentially tax themselves? one person‚Äôs generosity going even close pulled they‚Äôre taxed? Taxes exist reason. repeat: TAXES EXIST REASON. It‚Äôs hard figure out. Use head. 

Your second point meaningless unless back up. probably feels pressure deliver promising news

Who cares? Deliver scientifically accurate information. Maybe there's significantly less americans due covis-19? get that. defense shouldn‚Äôt believe cure soon exact reason can‚Äôt completely flip switch matter weeks still expect maintain credibility. appear sort hypocrisy he‚Äôs created isn‚Äôt public‚Äôs benefit could rooted something else. anyone expect anything different? CVS often pharmacist working. She‚Äôs lucky tech her. Nose swabs accurate. also China around 26 mink pelts produced yearly basis

are suggesting thing helped virus make jump animal human probably mink farm? maybe area supposed invaded habitat flock horseshoe bats? reason people wanted cheap fur coats? Good. majority population fears second wave, hopefully take proper precautions prevent it. law employees required notify customers many employees tested positive total, many currently quarantined.

My wife's work notify staff 2 days, asked quarantine county found demanded quarantine 10 more. also refused tell staff tested positive nobody knew exposed. staff figured tested positive(by investigation), quarantined 2 tested positive later week.

On note, remember republicans Senate delaying deal expand covid relief checks want add immunity corporations handling covid. 5 months ago, 4, 3, 2, even last month. escrow, I'd match whatever bet silly enough put thousand plus new daily cases US end  september. reason imagine willing say ""it could be"" fits snugly whatever ideological trap found in. conspiracy? Yikes, would hate immunosupressed kid get get extra credit. attempt prove virus used 'them' make Trump look bad. Like slightly worse regular flu. thinking set rules applies parties. second thought, need common set rules all. set rules applies person subject snitching. That's course years, months. People get new cancer diagnosis generally die within months. get delayed diagnosis generally die right away either. That's measure cancer survival 5 year increments. think lawsuits going come droves start coming. Although really know good defense 'DHS said so' court. Thank tips live properly poor. ever poor long term? know feels? 3% current numbers, conservative estimate deaths attributed/reported US, along current testing trends.

almost 190k official deaths good enough ya, eh? Manaus resident here, reached even 10% population infected (which would around 400k cases, still 120k confirmed).

The death hospitalization rates stable way that's going neither going much, still send everyone schools yet (only high schools) public universities closed, private ones remote learning. still international flights closed, first way infection Manaus. use masks everywhere (except poor neighboorhoods) every public cormmecial building kind mandatory use masks.

Without restrictions, would second wave already, like seeing Europe internacional tourism Natural selection ... idiots. hope spend much time policing misinformation ""civility"". old you?

Whoever vote end work capital Well probably yoy ignorant.

All stats better - like 6 times fewer dead. still loosing people us now.

Our lockdown ended like May everything open well. better did, unless consider people dying plus.

And countries even better us. insight happening Spain right now, understand really strict rules still. people use masks (correctly)? Social distancing? Staying home sick etc? Banks pay employees pay supposed based profits. problem current approach economics covid relief pretend top economy concentrated mass amount wealth top, reality bottom economy depends people bottom middle buying stuff. way save economy would monthly stimulus payments somesort universal income. blood alcohol? That'd first time history lawsuits US lawsuit actually *wasn't* filed insufficient hard proof wrongdoing. would still wear one. fire would sue... Oh wow wowee wowzer golly gee 260 cases population 350m many whatever shall do. Cali cases confirmed 717k death 13k 13/717 = 1.8%
FL 11/631= 1.7%
USA 185/6090 = 3%
USA correcting reported NY 185/7290 = 2.5%

Looks like FL line reality. Maybe reality chose live in. makes perfect sense, cold go outside winter north, hot go outside summer south. Sounds exactly like would expect. BLM protestors, infecting?

Literally anyone come contact with... anyone come contact with... anyone people come contact with.

You seem understand disease works. 

You check post history know I'm usually staunchly opposed lot doom gloom around here, attitude shameful. ignorant. Probably both.

Good.  argument lazy won‚Äôt change filters lmao

That may really, *really* stupid argument, tbh they're probably right.

It‚Äôs message sends- ‚Äúrules thee me‚Äù gone back forth predicting will, be.
 
I like 99% sure saying vaccine end year since early wipe stuff like outside bottle, wash hands, fine. good stats many schools offices actually still closed? see locally convos friends parts county, vast majority school school least part time people originally telecommuters starting go back office. Ok. didn‚Äôt answer question. rich people want pay voluntarily so. Nobody stopping them.

If tax top 50% wage earners 100% still couldn‚Äôt pay stuff suggested. Tbh that's dumb, there's ton people cities, restaurants much higher risk keep open there. people leaving city go eat lower risk areas? hypocritical they're another large city/outbreak prone area? bad misplaced joke makes seem like didn‚Äôt read article, referring international travel.

Fair enough, bad low key ""starting fight"". hope excellent day.


Edit: removed bunch words point honest, that's reason really give damn end day, figure idiots going kill family members perhaps me, ultimately they're selling country drink pub. Turns spending FEMA money unemployment benefits (so Trump could claim petty little victory) consequences!  Oh get it, you‚Äôre cunt. You‚Äôre also either 12, idiot, actually US, 3. flu killed 60k last year? Well 4-5 months covid killed least 200k increasing. immunity flu vaccines lots strains. immunity vaccine Covid-19 strain. want keep going shut up? could mean u mask up... u get asymptimatically infectedÔºü

No, can't. still get sick die mask on, since one layer mitigation means nothing layers breached (like sick person coughs right face, social distancing minimizing contact also important). many far impactful variables would determine sick get infected. children guinea pig.

Well Trump decided spend FEMA's money unemployment benefit could hero, turns disaster money important! saying Fauci lying data? Sucks can‚Äôt wear face shields work anymore, stuck soaked sweat rag face 12hours day heavy labour, can‚Äôt wait shit over. cases last week shown deaths hospitalizations. 74% increase last week almost 20% tests coming back positive.

They also reported high number people suffering ‚Äúheartbreak syndrome‚Äù ever since covid 19 started... coincidence ? We‚Äôre actually going much better even 2 weeks ago. According stat news fewer 1000 cases today first time couple months Washington give 60 day notice owners intent sell occupy. Nobody cares.  like snitching. I'm actually pretty sad never got opportunity major snitch. wanna ruin party. Pretty sure we‚Äôve made already. Local officials say individual businesses issue coronavirus mask mandates. We're talking now. We're talking flu season later year. Yes, why? course global pandemic natural disaster (not that's condition expect assistance government). else would be? 

There existing programs make sure people starve, ""not starving death"" going enough bring economy back. need people confident ability spend money shit need survive. homeless forced debt medical bills and/or unemployment can't spend money kinds goods services. stimulus money get disappear basic necessities paying credit cards. ensuring people forced desperation now, ensure safe reopen jobs return everyone quickly return normal spending/consumption habits initial huge surge spending get things miss spending money most. 

Without it, desperate spending money anything survival digging debt take years decades. Even moderately impacted conservative spending rebuild savings plenty money find fewer places spend every business continue suffer reduction consumer spending. time control we're already going dealing fact millions dead sick return work/participate economy. best thing economy right get spread virus control. that, next best thing make sure easy possible people get right back working, selling, buying. teacher unions important. way hell school able prevent protecting yourself. That's trial governing body. Completely different organization.

There's set agenda meeting either.  Hard say. Epidemiological perspective... second waves spikes hampered much restrictions like masks/social distancing requirements people walking around anti-bodies last wave. 

I think complicated many factors. smith make entire movie himself, yet learned nothing. SMH Good news? fucking kidding me? RemindMe! December 31, 2020 ""Vaccinations here!"" troll.

You disable valve duct-taping external internal valve openings.

With care, 8511 last months intermittent use.

Typical surgical paper folded masks seal wearers face, 8511 seal well. :( strawman. Super cool

&amp;#x200B;

It also forces someone who's concerned catch 22. say ""ok, this?"" they'll ""prove"" they're degen. don't, well, they've bullied corner despite thinking they've got evidence right there. think we'll get vaccine end year get elderly risk, including health care workers, let's try think calling folks degenerates. Fauci said Tuesday interview Kaiser Health News Data Safety Monitoring Board, committee made independent experts evaluate safety vaccine development, could decide ‚Äú‚Äòthe data good right say it‚Äôs safe effective.'‚Äù

Yes, *could* data good. think there's government planet waiting full trial completed authorizing vaccine- would take well 2022. first need look see data good. We're month two away that. bad faith. I'm disagreeing - sorry came wrong way. Fortunately vaccines already produced, much shortage come populations.  Especially since probably like ‚ÄúSweden unlucky, Denmark lucky‚Äù covid lottery.

Nopes, lockdown difference. matter luck.

Sweden's restictions fine well adapted low level corona around, least AFAIK. weird things kept ones tougher set really ton corona around. What's better, getting punched face 10x 40x? üò∑ love lol Ha Look tag below... Yeah. wonder what‚Äôs (un-)special fleece. apply surgical mask exhalation valve tape. That's literally doctors currently ICU intubate COVID patients. honest, got word principal they‚Äôre going hybrid two weeks worse expectations. Literally one saying that. that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying too. isn‚Äôt thought clearly due yearning ‚Äúappear normal possible‚Äù. Time lock comment section? Imagine 3 years ago. 

I even worried Trump inaugurated, thought sure he'd rage quit impeached 6 months wild incompetence stifled adults room. think US would've thrown towel threat century, top everything else, would've bizarre. Yeah work local brewery getting nervous. owner already asked employee give ""tours"" get around taproom rules. dont want around it.  principal also said would enough hand sanitizer even first week person school.

Soap buckets/containers water + garbage cans paper towels is, then. also cloth masks sleeves hide HEPA filter material in. doubt that's safe, alternative? Also - switch wrap around eye glasses / safety glasses prescriptions.

Edit: alternative filter materials go inside fabric mask sedentary. Takes 2 weeks. 4-6 weeks testing show spike (2nd 3rd generation infections event) deaths another weeks behind. Yikes barely thought teachers. school lenient.. classes every day live recorded attend, watch all. Webcams required microphones teachers. Students could use mic ask questions, type chat. People actually enjoyed going classes.

Teachers also need online entire day. They'd come online classes get notification message. mic webcam required students personal meetings (only grades get low/think may cheating, student needs help).
Man lucky. That's proper online school trusts teachers students.

I hope wife's school (and many others) adjusted less strict environment Link without paywall: http://archive.is/0gV9z Doubtful. Always jobs alternatives. Wrong. Oh üôÑ That's kind think future.

Oh, 60% infected cardiac issues rest lives. Let‚Äôs forget that. ""the media"" say dumbass Gotta troll stop ""Mask good, anti-maskers bad"" posts? 

The idiots belive masks control spread COVID part sub, there's point making echo chamber type posts day day out.

Edit: bad, saw downvoted comment. Keep posts coming. lost little faith humanity. spread exponentially, 

Found person who's never played Plague. Literally none means vaccine approved early stages distribution year anything wonderful news.  Yep, fuck 2020 Yeah, aren‚Äôt anywhere near across country.   Rural communities smaller cities going get hit cause sat around going ""whatever happening big cities.""  A*ab brigade contradicting usual Mission accomplished. Countries went masks lockdowns almost universally seeing second waves. countries mandate masks lockdowns. Wait. fauci out? Sorry, I'm thrilled nurse. inevitably become test dummy medication job compromised. good feeling drug forced tested way be.

For flu vaccine able wear mask deny vaccine, think lax this, understand that. teacher would wear N95, offense government completely botched this, can‚Äôt trust anything coming government agency Nolan notes school seen evidence spread students faculty members related specifically on-campus activities.

Like covid19 gives shit school pays receives money from.   Knowing China's lack safety procedures trust China vaccine either. One us rejecting expert consensus iffy evidence. comparing peaks noisy graph doesn‚Äôt mean much. 68 vs 65 first responded to. 

just saying strawman doesn‚Äôt prove shit either.

Given use intentionally misleading data sloppily, data provide pretty much equal. clearly watch Fox OAN grasp topic.


So clarify 9,000 referring died Covid-19, rest 180,000+ died due Covid-19.

Here example would give 5-year-old

1) person gets Covid-19 dies= person died Covid-19

2) person gets Covid-19 dies due organ failure brought Covid-19= person died organ failure DUE covid-19

I miss going going boozing. degree seems small now. I'd prefer period end ASAP, obviously, given massive damages human life economics. quarantine period rather enlightening closer towards desired ""good life"" eluding long pre-covid.

Also 25% hospitalization rate, 0.2% IFR. There‚Äôs 6 million documented cases COVID US. reality it‚Äôs probably least twice high. Measles would overshot herd immunity point infected entire population US. 

This also good lesson understanding viruses spread. Clearly measles didn‚Äôt infect entire US world population effectively eradicated it. COVID won‚Äôt either. 

But measles insidious spread easily, deadly enough scary much longer incubation period. also similar long term issues like chronic fatigue pneumonia fun stuff like hearing loss blindness. 190,000 deaths utter failure Also consider CDC actually listed 'conditions causes' upon death limited pre-existing conditions. 

The insanity people 94% group may zero pre-existing conditions. folks sign risks stay away then. positive test mean covid contributed death person. someone got hit bus died, tested positive covid, would misleading call covid victim. bummer.

Well, nursing home without put solitary confinement really shielded, they? Everyone uses Google Apple. Google listen talking testing positive. looking similar thought experiment US, might worth examine know they‚Äôve done research.

Although research also shown people refuse wear masks sociopathic tendencies likely reason. Personality disorder. requirement release document nursing home. mother-in-law gets better care home.

Nope. lies distortions.  Malignant neoplasms (aka, cancer) small amount compared died respiratory disease, guess what? COVID causes! Canada said proof covid isolated. came response information request proof isolated.

Why would person write Health Canada? write numerous labs around world isolated, purified, sequenced, propagated virus? think 32kb RNA pops thin air patients COVID-19? would scientific first. explain it, go ahead write paper collect Nobel doctors calling end lockdown, saying lockdown causing harm virus.

It's September 2nd now.  going spread time. Unfortunately also old people die things like undetected cancer heart disease caught due shut downs, guarantee one gives shit exciting watching people die virus 0.5% death rate. lot people area care. ran grocery store. first 3 people saw noses sticking masks.

&amp;#x200B;

You get sick leave sick. 

Only ""vacation"" ""bank holidays"" actual time off... Often ""training time"" taken also(and regulated state level - place it, bavaria example (But got bank holidays)). 

Many items list ""one time"" (or few) like childcare (I forgot mention 10 days (capped 25) per child ""Child sick leave"")

Vacation also ""only"" 24 days law vs 30 (6 weeks) - many companies normal rate. 

Yes, paid taxes insurance fees. (Thats quoted healthcare free - everyone pays \~15-16% wage - pick several ""identical"" choices - yes paid yur employer makes difference) 

But main issue sick days. kinda exist here... kick 6 weeks sickness (With reduced wage) 

The 1st 6 weeks covered 100% employer - law - way out. Many employers also extend period cover gap coverage 6 weeks (Both wife benefits 100% different corps) supposed work sick. public health insurance takes slightly reduced pay to78 weeks.

Part also dont hire fire culture here... Even April lay offs (But pay reduction government ""Kurzarbeit"" company needed it). cant dismiss anyone sick (after probation 6 month) need solid reason that

Its lot cheaper cure person slight issue wait till getting complicated. 

""PTO"" death folks usually 1/2 days... often 1-2 days ""special events"" dont happen often 

The 12 weeks covid chidcare part corps covid package, great (early homeoffice order actual shitstorm, good comunication also many items community). also social oriented even (even Germans unusal benefits) like got paid time wifes surgery... Basically whole social aspect workplace going ""wow"" year (Sadly... 2020 sucked) - thats US company providing US needed benefits world wide. way ""stack"" welcome started woodworking. know doing, started. helps alot, 6 months easy. School reopenings going interesting watch Texas lots teachers administrators Republicans. cognitive dissonance ones complete morons. Tell I'm wrong. guinea pig phase 2 trial :) effective vaccine?

Yeah, studies interesting vital stepping stone understanding virus more, added total body research, practical proof metaphorical pudding.

Real world results continue show drawing conclusions stage research putting cart horse tries kick apart *every* time let guard get close. won't, person mind made googled something. live province teachers paid comparatively well. :( seem instead mish mash programs like this, government could coordinated one program (aka ubi) help renters owners etc it‚Äôd way easier cheaper administer. wonder cost difference would really been? bet didn‚Äôt even run analysis this. fear mongering subreddit clue. assume includes main campus two smaller ones well. iirc main one idk many countries world? wanna talk couple worse?

Lets make easy G7 Lmao know better Fauci now? teacher father two young children, why? 

My children guinea pig. that. Listen Fauci, know Aids aren‚Äôt going let happen again. Nearly 90% population live cities towns well. Without would less deaths answer. advised masks start... bares lot responsibility mask debating. told wear masks FIRST roll back safety measures. don‚Äôt start least measures. need governments insurance stop paying tests don‚Äôt provide results 48 hours. shortage tests first, enough tests shortly thereafter. keep paying companies give results 2 weeks later they‚Äôre worthless, they‚Äôre going invest getting results back sooner. live world. make happen change pay tests. Quarantining fine all, it‚Äôs painful better way. mention schools really care students really fall apart every aspect. school suspended 30 days straight. finally returned school called office asked school. emptiness eyes Lol fucking way Election Nov 3, new president start Jan 20th so? Yeah, can't wait trump use DOJ curiosity, many lives cost stick principals, Trump puts someone else OAN charge, fuckery delays vaccene another six months? 

I plenty principals, may save personal attacks another time. also know exactly cold comfort principals clinging causes people suffer. Typical parent donating cleaning supplies classroom every month wasn‚Äôt pandemic. painfully unaware levels poverty majority Americans living in. 2020. virtual options safe staff, teachers, students, families. obviously young get yet OK. 

You can't face face classes teachers staff. no, can't fire everyone field BEGGING people. Teachers backbone country without them, would lot deeper hole right now. office tried bring us back beginning June things looking better CA. lasted 2 weeks saw spike CA cases shut again. also reason believe scares people potentially coming office. 

It pointless going staggering folks literally meetings taking place. ""butts seat"" mentality poor poor executives take working home million dollar homes (cry river). 

Anyways, think office situation bad since use conservative verbiage. could try saying underlying condition better yet, someone family does. look good (legally speaking) get sick something happens gave heads up. 30 days ago, Denmark 7-day moving average 26 daily new cases

50, 26. August August 31: 84 daily new cases, 7-day moving average. 320% Denmark 30 days ago!

August 1 50, August 31 84, 68% growth even could tobacco lobbying, speaking drug addict/alcoholic (sober), think 90+% would quit. addicts go great lengths get want can't force addicts quit. want order even chance working. Agreed! dare you!

Could bunch old people nursing homes die, test positive covid either still alive did, usual pneumonia bad sickness accompany covid, die heart attack, cancer, something else, ruled died covid? 
Or mean physically fit totally healthy 25 year old wake morning perfectly normal day, tested positive covid? 
Or mean someone tested positive covid, got sick coughing symptoms, develop pneumonia, died? Maybe that's medical conditions impact it, obese, asthma, cancer, etc, body's systems strong enough fight off. 
Pretty ambiguous think we'll ever know. fact 6% leads believe something expert experts try figure out, something concern worry general public like me. I'm whining, I'm happy back classroom.

You ask measurably decreased people's life expectancy. did. reason, trying fixate mortality people would died within 3 months time actually die Covid complications.

We look mortality age range, debate it.

OR, look steady state number people die *from causes*, realize Covid's impact measurable. anything, official Covid-19 Death Counts *understimate* impact. Exactly, collegiate system flawed greatly needs completely overhauled IMO. near expensive 60s 70s wonder why? 

But astronomical loans pay back hence health care system control. body wins.

So guess waiting game. would love see next 40 years look like. hate say hope I‚Äôm see it. hoping best future generations. ...people die killed. There‚Äôs good candidate. agree there.

Now, outdoor activities, I‚Äôm normally good distance people, occasionally I‚Äôm bit closer. park path use 12 feet wide, everyone hugs edge stay 10 feet apart. Unfortunately people stride middle path, groups people like walk four wide reason, typically masks. can, I‚Äôve cutting park grass instead keep distance, perils I‚Äôve stumbled 9 different Yellowjacket/wasp nests walks summer.

Anyways, hope neck gaiters would provide light protection, hopefully enough outdoor setting distance people, limited duration near person, easy pull down/pull depending proximity others. could wear around neck pull see someone ahead pass soon. I‚Äôm one people wears anything walks/runs, maybe isn‚Äôt necessary given factors outdoors figure precaution better wearing nothing. article though, sounds like huffing gaiter run increases number small particles hanging air, either need go without mask choose better outdoor mask. sucks learn time making things potentially worse. Granted outdoors, maybe particle dispersal sufficient either way, still want protect others.

In end, went ahead ordered set better masks outdoor activities. 190,000 Americans annually would still alive wasn‚Äôt cigarettes Already spreading like wildfire, keep seeing ‚Äúfinally truth comes out‚Äù, ‚Äúsee it‚Äôs bad‚Äù, shitty ass memes like killing mosquito tripping stick hitting head cause death would covid?

That's presuming *every single* person died Coronavirus would died flu, assuming reason everyone else would died flu successfully avoided year magical reason, using largest end estimate flu year.

You'd **still** 128,000 extra deaths. *So far.* malicious pervert five simple points.

Here‚Äôs attempt maliciously perverting points:

1) Irrelevant it‚Äôs basic hygiene regardless virus 2) Liberals think perfume causes coronavirus 3) 1917 flu total disaster, clearly masks didn‚Äôt work well 4) people die anyway, doesn‚Äôt matter 5) pass matter do, destroy economy? new reports even fabric masks help lower initial viral load infected compared wearing one. could lead mild cases mask wearers. Nothing proven yet, another good reason wear mask! flu underlying symptoms? Lucky covid nobody died flu 2020. that, doomers like want prevent others same.  New York California way dense terms population Florida Texas city metropolitan areas. Denser population means chance getting contact someone infected. makes contact tracing harder meet hundreds people day compared single digits.

I'm sure Clinton Cuomo would done differently, time could rewind, things done different.

1) take seriously onset. January February China lock Wuhan, signal virus serious. Start acknowledging virus spread correct information

2) border control. There's two ways it. either full travel ban trump failed partial ban. also highly unlikely country like US full ban. best alternative screen trace traveller's US. Also, pay billions military peacetime, also pay billions medical staff admin personnel check trace traveller's.

3) testing. I'm sure remember US barely tested anyone early days virus. testing done earlier, preventive action could done

4) masks. pretty obvious. 

5) subsizided Healthcare. pandemic, early days test Healthcare part subsizided, would encouraged people come forward tests treatment. believe least reduces viral load, linked severe symptoms are. Arizona? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Meanwhile can‚Äôt even open Cuomo‚Äôs social media replies without seeing nursing home response mentioned conservatives one million times per post I‚Äôm Adrian.

Reads like fake account twitter comment. symptoms eventually lead multiple organ failure first across line wins killing you.  Comorbidities gives certain organs bit head start. Facts mean nothing Trumpian base, insane fuck new? We've talking damn Chinese bus case since [at least March 96% similar viruses found horseshoe bats China. However, species studied, Rhinolophus affinis found Southeast Asia China. Also, horseshoe bats found world. indication also similar viruses found greater horseshoe bats, Europe, example far know.

Also:

 *""But 4% difference actually pretty wide distance evolutionary time. could even decades,"" says Dr. Robert F. Garry, professor microbiology immunology Tulane University School Medicine*
 think origins virus found China all, rather across border Myanmar, Laos Cambridge study also raised new questions. first strain isolated reported Chinese scientists actually younger original type caused outbreak. US strains genetically closer bat virus Wuhan prompted heated debates research Citation needed Paging Captain Obvious, pick white phone Ignorance is. suggest research gain foundational understanding work, thinking. Someone mad Fauci also told us wear masks hot minute spread covid transmission misinformation one occasion. know point vaccines? Hint: it‚Äôs stop (healthy person) dying. DEATHS HAPPEN IMMMMMMMOOOOORRRRRTTTTTTALLLLLLLL I'm alright CT government far. We've done well covid. due respect Dr. Fauci, that's news! million dollar question (if anyone actually still cares) many Americans would alive competent response pandemic? many would alive aggressive response pandemic? also study mask efficacy. study method measuring mask efficacy. Especially heavily people rely public transit, elevators, mentioned sheer density people Well, pandemics tend last 12 months, peak 6 months, recede gradually final 6 months so. look Worldometers, new cases plateau since mid-July. looks like may peak. 

I think there‚Äôs chance fall isn‚Äôt awful; rather, may see gradual reduction new cases week week December health experts may feel comfortable enough say ‚ÄúCOVID‚Äôs decline, it‚Äôs time start resuming normal activities slowly.‚Äù

Then again, virus pretty stubborn staying power, maybe I‚Äôm hopelessly optimistic. can‚Äôt see schools staying closed past January 1st though. They‚Äôll forced open point, matter prevalent COVID still then. Straight FAX. Seems like standard operating procedure good ole USA. Selfish fucks. I'd recheck math problem media objectivity make value statements everything step back facts. can't say ""190,000 Americans died year"" statement fact. ""this person says x"" ""this person disagrees person."" gives illusion debate choice believe, truth point view person. please pretty fucking please take control america back this..

i know sick elite am

they clearly represent us. even playing field.. proposed solution good enough. except 100% equality across board.. means extreme wealth gaps. everyone health plans. etc

fuck elite. driving us extinction.. literally what? know many kids school? inevitable. kids way way less likely hospitalized die adults.  started school 2 weeks ago. COVID+ kids yet. I'm sure happen - 2 staff COVID+. quarantined, cleaned school, moved on. solvable, it. hell still homeless people? never wear mask die WTF. I'd like citation mortality rate ""a months"" 40+% 190,000 died. I'm quite certain making up.

As evidence making up, look Death rate per 100,000 broken generous you, say meant ""unlikely live year."" Let's look group worst mortality rate, 85+.

14,689 1000,000 men aged 85+ die year. 400,000. (""40%"" 100,000 would 400,000.)

*Even if* pretend meant ""a year"" instead ""a months,"" still over-stated deaths **twenty-seven times.**

And that's frail group, 85+, Covid-19 deaths major fraction, yes, fraction.

Yes, I'm citing study directly refutes claim 40% *did* die Covid-19 sickly ones anyway. given I've seen, strikes remarkable claim requires proof. So, it, please share citation.  .3 microns size least efficiency several filtering media. Filtering efficiency improves particles larger smaller that. .3 microns crossover point straight line filtration becomes less effective diffusion effects particle motion starts dominate. Put ELI5 terms, smaller particles get knocked around air molecules longer follow straight path. get bounced sideways filter media stick.

Google ""diffusion regime"".  Yes is. every death certificate likely got signed pneumonia, septic shock, cardiogenic shock, etc secondary case underlying listed Covid19. Trump get overall clinical disease COVID19, virus cause well host complications kill people. 

We moron Oval Office. answer question. nothing value add here. Tucson‚Äôs kicking ass! I‚Äôve signed too, haven‚Äôt heard back. Thanks helping. Well, need vaccine. one NEEDS one. want, nothing more.

If heart attack flu time, necessarily die flu. Russians field day easily people US manipulated Hardly anyone capable recognizing dissonance. sincerely believe complication comes developing coronavirus vaccine cutting unnecessary red tape. Biden ends death Nov. 4 2020!!!! Denmark still massive increase Sweden's cases decline. initial assertion supposed ready Sept. Clearly false always planning US trials time period. Currently there's concrete evidence. found despite accusations. 50c definitely worth it. hey, people south boarder definitely need it.
come back try I‚Äôd bet like half nursing home ones would dead anyway truly understand ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired statement‚Äù. listen BS keep mouth shut paycheck depends it. wears you. Exactly, fuck give perfect attendance awards. kids‚Äô parents given badge shame year. life 'expectancy' lowered.  point statistics unchanged because..... long run, 100.0% humans die? covid change that?

Would feel way long run air pollution low quality food instead covid?

People dying sooner reasonably avoided usually bad........ right? Yes, thing goes way - people old/immunocompromised/other getting virus likely kill them, whether covid cold whatnot. Given 40% deaths occurred nursing homes/LTC facilities average remaining life months, reasonable assume good chunk people would, unfortunately, still us today. 

Don't get wrong, federal response horrific. agree headline. CLEANED TABLES   It‚Äôs stupid- first get evicted California normal circumstances (ie; courts aren‚Äôt overwhelmed thousands eviction cases) often normal courts backed it‚Äôs to3 months since 3 day notice case heard, tenant drag much much longer, showing hearings offering legitimate excuses complaints asking payment plan... it‚Äôs sure much longer normal even get case front judge. judge rules favor landlord, sheriff scheduled. usually backed too, huge back log now. 

Fucking landlord would better negotiating you.

And lender foreclosing - DIPSHITTEDNESS! it‚Äôs even harder get rid tenant ownership hands changed. lenders foreclose stupid good managing rental properties.

Edit- spelling
Edit- also, didn‚Äôt answer question, banks landlord need negotiate loan extension higher interest rate cover lost revenue, take hit it- would help congress would offer tax break lender opts extent loan lieu foreclosure. redistribution means infection think collects social security? older people small, super remote villages barely read. deffo best way survive Well, US. last week face shield+mask considered 'bulletproof' right? Shit.

Edit: Oh wait, Face shield+valve face shield alone=ineffective. def wear KN95 face shield. How's dick taste bro? Thing virus lands lungs almost always causes pneumonia fatal due that. hard consider COVID death cause underlying symptoms. never, ever unlikely NYC epicenter viral outbreak. That's nature international business hub high population density. blaming Cuomo, saying general. Cities always hit hard. Vietnam! bad faith argument. Apparently think impossible heart attack covid time unrelated. Sorry, work like infuriating. *better* United States develop vaccines without sharing knowledge globally getting shared knowledge others developing vaccines? Definitely solution. one administration power employs. 

It kind like ""If test would cases"" DHS opinion here? it‚Äôs Why? hand full countries invaded/occupied/colonised yet! Nope, not.

See, suspicious deaths causes lumped COVID-19 bucket nefarious reasons, check see many people total dying compared averages. can't fake death; death death.

And that, see [the number deaths year US compared average is....200k higher Except, course, July 31, data, realistically total swung 200k considerably.

Too bad whoever fed talking point speaking dishonestly. ReOpeN teH Econ.   sub (hell, _thread_) predicted there'd massive death toll Sturgis.

Everyone luxury. choice. College parties absolutely nothing like protests/rallies lead eaters That's No.1 Europe. feel bad Dr. Fauci, dude toughest job world: Trying convince politicians kill people. Odds probably like 1.6 know people risk homeless tenant doesn‚Äôt pay rent. fact make two homeless people, homeowner tenant. working home last 6 months clearly costing lives. Here‚Äôs wrong:
1. home, may even sick.

2. highly contagious virus spreads exponentially.

3. People highly contagious show symptoms. means spreading around place go.

4. Coronavirus long tail students ill long time.

5. Locals around colleges don‚Äôt want get sick hospitals crowded students.  Gonna lots labor pains then. Allot older people experts fields. rely teach younger generations. wisdom replaced. got anything? Totally didn‚Äôt see one coming  able get months anyways unless fall priority category means 6% died Covid? Wear cloth mask N95 mask? big news italy right flu kills far young people, sure take lightly - deadly disease. Holy shit dude calm hell üòÇ know got big Reddit hate boner pushing pants, popular thing talk comment, re-read wrote. write something broadly encompassing yet ridiculously specific mindset? Lol

Also, scroll THREE-QUARTERS way find single downer; hundred comments complaining ""downers""

So ""actual pessimistic comment"" ""complaining pessimism comment"" ratio like 1:100 people charge (Trump) want everyone die better chance elected. high majority teachers know Democrat independent, go figure. They'll catch 1% guilty party all. Thats right- studies people serious case hospitalization.

But research end year useful know widespread statistically significant is. We're talking people degrees public health health administration. best brightest lol. Incompetence norm. True. fact, don‚Äôt seem need data form opinions.

That, combined arguing bad faith nasty combo. cold send people work without protection. Oh ok fuck ppl homeless talking motorboat?  Excess deaths. months year twice many people died compared year. real number probably closer 500k Yes. I‚Äôm saying two stats aren‚Äôt things compare other. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying. 

And course accidental poisoning stat came Covid-19. may true life time normalized chance dying poisoning one thing. That‚Äôs say that‚Äôs pandemic. course change accidental poisoning among drug addicts probably skews statistic quite bit. stat isn‚Äôt going take account people don‚Äôt regularly behavior causes chance overdose. 

Basically numbers totally irrelevant reason sentence. 


What would meaningful, chances healthy non drug addicted 30 year old male dying next year pre Covid-19 Covid-19. 

And chances change general population taking minor precautions versus precautions. 


Talking average eventual cause death fairy meaningless conversation COVID-19. So... hospitals facing ppe shortages solution lie teachers tell don‚Äôt need ppe safe? Wtf even know insurance. get sick, still need pay $6,000 deductible funny. Whenever promising study pops there's 20 people parroting ""iS pEeR rEvIeWeD?"" still valid complaint. whenever negative results come study gets thousands upvotes logic never pops even though also recent studies way peer-reviewed fast. Mr. President again? ban using N95 masks, banned use N95 respirators. difference word choice specific actually reading memo released school district. respirators much larger much different look them. see children could see scary intimidating. top that, mention OSHA requirements employee's wearing respirators training done order wear them.  means one them. three, shown promising results far, least one pull end get approved end year. Try 150 million US alone. many people fall priority categories ""widely available"". going able get vaccine million people unless healthcare worker countries universal healthcare, medical expenses end costing government lot money (e.g. Covid hospitalizations, ICU, post Covid treatments, post Covid tests, heart/lung scans, physical therapy, chronic conditions caused Covid, related medications). track 190,000+ dead Monday. means, 90% us Brits psychopaths. Makes sense. Reading comprehension low days, that's why. Much like self awareness. Leadership. Empathy. Many things. 

He flat said thinks masks dumb without saying because, you/he mentioned, could get trouble. see anyone could read defend it, people did.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è late, colleges already reopened, students already got campus dorms enjoyed services.

That doesn‚Äôt apply everyone every case. stating there‚Äôs scenario make sense. 

Of course long term software engineering firms, example, procedures place doesn‚Äôt happen it‚Äôs early kind see it.

Edit: using buttress pensions, etc that‚Äôs ridiculous. quarter. painful may hear, remember us getting vaccinated still benefit rest us. might going buy masks. think shithole Save Lot sells good, high quality masks? Trump block unless gets make fortune it. big ooof make promises. prediction. what? What‚Äôs upside broke, scared nation point faith administration? Guy's legit though. Harvard biostatistician PhD Medicine. appear partisan political type either.

It's interesting take. think misses point social distancing lockdowns, glosses it: Preventing overwhelming health systems there's vaccine good treatment. Seems pretty obvious that, far costing deaths, lockdowns prevented deaths (at great cost, course). look early Italy NYC see that. Still, central point, COVID contagious widespread, especially asymptomatic cases, end way herd immunity, accurate think. think hand-waving suggestion ""just protect old people"" realistic, though, I'm sure observation means much thinks does. That's common sense. Get bent. Yes law tailored pander people think like win popularity points. ""this fine"" - mitch Susan collins yet everytime something he's supposed allowed do... let think chalk 'you can't wear mask pandemic' straight maliciousness column. don‚Äôt RTFA, it‚Äôs Wisconsin State Department Health Services. military came said would get involved dispute winner election, settled congress courts. 

So... haven‚Äôt noticed, congress courts terrible track record letting trump get away anything. might another explanation - virus strains different deadly ones gone people died, remaining strains - ones circulating atm, since circulating, killing hosts. virus ""mutated"" deadly. like H1N1 back then. Sandusky, Ohio. idiot! wear mask.  mean, yeah can, laughed hung on. Exactly. Everyone says want Guinea pig, half US population going get ""general public"", unless fall priority category, probably want get it. sitting ""president"" try claim public schools used ""indoctrinate lefties,"" mind ""president"" knowingly allowed pandemic fester cities states well forced fend themselves, perceived ""leftist."" mean... looking increasingly likely herd immunity essentially table. moral reason, reinfection questionable immunity whatever, simply numbers. 

We're coming 6 months thing even high estimate, 60 million Americans infected. Fauci came said [we'll probably vaccine many months left people start getting shots (even accounting distribution/wide adoption time lag). suppose totally went back normal tomorrow, virus could maybe rip another 200 million Americans December. assuming keep modicum control get worse shitshow we've already 6 months (which REALLY shouldn't, one hope), point there's way we'll anywhere near ~70% immunity time vaccine drops. know get food.. even grow food, hunt need food badly..

I can't cure covid. know came back seem new reports last two days around this...I'm hoping means testing come positive results. I'm sure we'll forget next week lol chronic sinus issues, suspect sinus infection hanging around while. serious, gets worse days. sinus infections typically feel pressure face sinuses, accompanied headaches even tooth pain. throat become irritated postnasal drip (sinus crud draining throat).  


I think test results going depend get tested test use. would say way know sure, varied covid symptoms seem be, actually get test. don‚Äôt think matters result Sweden export economy worst yet come. new orders books. bunga bunga money cant make yunga! *They* outrage protests *they* outraged audience wanted hear pandemic big deal, *they* preferred tu quoque shuffle instead. Better ratings. swear r/science study posted saying face shields vented masks effective stopping spread droplets.  get that, little counter-intuitive suppress system that's supposed protect infections infected virus? you‚Äôre sick bed dead can‚Äôt vote! Makes perfect sense! bunga bunga! Im confused. Wear mask. prohibited leave. Freeeeeeeddddddduuuuuuuummmmbbbbbb 100% this. global pandemic didn‚Äôt stop taking $$$ sending several emails consequences late payments.  look countries handling things go stand corner think shame bring family spouting nonsense.  mean could going shore.... spin like ""he went way Maryland violate rule!"" sounds worse probably true. He's allowed go shore. carry food mayor totally different place given us different restrictions? trust CDC, makes think trust OSHA? probably headed attorney built career defending business OSHA fines. Fucking party must named. agree that. Florida sure took beating new Yorkers flocked here. ""Do flag?"" news star! Oh god, comedy writes itself... Shame fully serious otherwise I'd laughing instead crying. still resisting. everyone saying quit, anyway let fire you.

/agree

Forcing fire following bullshit rules definitely way go. athlete gets brain fog whatever term lack energy, they're done for. spanish flu would better example. still reoccurs (in fact flu shot year part stop it), never came back full even nearly full strength.

but pandemics do. smallpox ravaged us again, slow burning pandemic lasted hundreds years buried people disease Black Death.

we know whether covid spanish flu smallpox terms reoccurence yet. government said ""masks help keep others safe, please buy essential workers need them"" many people's selfishness survival instincts would've kicked millions would bought masks anyways.

Yeah, think still would enough left. article says reason going allowed cannot fit tested medical personnel, like hospital. ¬†‚ÄúN95 respirators really work best health care setting someone available fit tested necessarily best thing using school setting.‚Äù agree Trump held us back testing. end, he's one man: misrule characterized covid response goes much deeper that. people going away time soon. don‚Äôt think partisan, especially since he‚Äôs Canadian... 

He pointing idea you‚Äôre BLUE, want vaccine save everyone watch (which could post nov 3rd). you‚Äôre RED, want immediately boost polls.

Not hard concept. said - conspiracy, certainly.

Maybe don‚Äôt asshole? University currently peddling belief able host full time person classes October. know America living in, considering literally 50 COVID infections summer term amongst skeleton crew. Roll tide fault neighboring state strict rules. Blame them. blaming people following rules? I've never gotten last business day month. payday usually first half month here, course next month.  rockstar! think kind pointless mad about. live Philly ate indoor breakfast Conshy last week. stricter Montgomery County, eating somewhere outside city make hypocrite? 

I mean he's kind shitty mayor even violate rules. people free go somewhere else eat indoors allowed. Educational institutions placing students, faculty, staff, communities exist clear obvious risk pretty impactful decision itself.

So worse? institution knowingly &amp; willingly makes commission dangerous transgression minority people possible, unsurprising resultant commission transgression? indoctrinated outlets voices flawed system started with. Imagine telling 6 years ago United States would experience pandemic little possible lack leadership President Donald Trump, people would pretend real hundreds thousands dying‚Äîand Smash Mouth still band, people went see said pandemic. people died it.

Imagine leaps logic would take believe that. rate [1.13 deaths per 100 million vehicle likely resulted 418 fewer traffic deaths. N95 masks protect mold spores, viruses significantly smaller. would imagine venn diagram ""People still listen Smash Mouth"" ""People think covid hoax"" single circle. think bad press 2020 fans.

Stay strong&lt;3 Dont ever quit, make fire you, sue wrongful termination proved ""effective"" beyond threshold(50%) 150 positive cases control groups Moderna Pfizer phase 3 trial.

I've seen real numbers fail fake numbers pass. relatively easy generate fake numbers pass, actually. It‚Äôs oppressive American policy days.

 Can‚Äôt wait election. happens every class ask question send email. maybe need different kind union. I've noticed lot laws aimed weakening union structure typically days generally applicable industrial unionism rely heavily contract negotiations.

Not saying abandon union but, know, dual carding thibg. fire would sue...

Unless gop gets want...which protects businesses schools etc. sued whole ordeal. fucked. gop kinds fucked up. Sounds like really issue then, pay mortgage keep whinging, whatever. Lol much get paid week nonsensical rebuttal called ""PR gig"". CIA need spend money wisely. Murca bought FFP2 (European standard similar N95 KN95) masks pharmacies, similar price range. expensive one even paid 10 ‚Ç¨. nowadays many masks ordered online. weeks ago bough masks advertised FFP2 via Amazon. received labelled FFP2 KN95, could fitted well quite cheap (5 10 ‚Ç¨), ordered more. second batch marked FFP2, N95 KN95, fit worse first batch (mainly due weaker wire). still think fit better surgical masks, turn filter better cloth masks general. figurative sense, yes, that's appears.

I think what's actually going thing see wide variety problems seem ""unsolvable"" western right-wing/center right societies: free market solution COVID-19. Whenever issue can't solved capitalism harder, sits political limbo years decades, matter costs gets hurt meantime.

I think actively WANT us get sick. they're comfortable degree economic shutdown required really stop pandemic. sent professor email problem I‚Äôm class week ago. Still response. ask question zoom, get ignored. I‚Äôm seriously pissed.

Sometimes it‚Äôs grand conspiracy. Take break internet. That's incredibly well-written article student. I've seen lot professional reporters major newspapers write half understandably intelligently. Places N95 also stop selling public favor medical staff, half mask respirator finding filters pain, finding mask impossible reserved. agree everything stated question statement circulating regarding reinfection stated well. really cannot make statement assumptions reinfection yet. requirement needed actually prove reinfection requires genetic testing virus first suspected second case widely done. optimistic rare, hesitate jump conclusion either way seems lately state opinion later additional evidence comes change opinion, people seem go deep end.  wear damn masks..

Seat belts..traffic lights, railroad crossings, million things common people dying unnecessarily

Whether globally low percentage not, still many dying.üòî OK, going determine priority? Seems make sense healthcare workers first responders first. Beyond that, know elderly underlying heath conditions highest risk. Ultimately, people die vaccine itself. needs determined risk disease also risk dying vaccine.

Furthermore, need know long lasts. Evidence emerging immunity disease likely lasting 3 months so. vaccine lasts long, unlikely, often people need get vaccinated. number conspiracy theories arise vaccine trump (no pun intended) seen date.

Further yet, effective vaccine. Flu vaccines hover around 40-60%. get guaranteed protection get vaccine especially occur overnight. likely 6 month period. week ends.

Then next week. ""Rules thee, me.""

I‚Äôm lawyer that‚Äôs sounds like major problem. N95 masks effective fitted properly, meaning seals checked seal test performed, following proper training. also disposable reused following recommended wear time - people don‚Äôt adhere since expensive. But, Costco provide training instead shifting blame - they‚Äôre mom pop. short term, could cover N95 regular surgical mask like many doctors nurses. would file complaint OSHA via US Department Labor right away. way live life Doctors originally said I'll lucky survive 30, turning 29 year I'll see soon enough prove wrong.

I know people have! believe you. Stay healthy. Underrated comment right here. political pressure pushes vaccine November 3rd, there's person world would trust say safe. OMG... want live almost anywhere US right now. conservative leaders keep saying ""personal choice"" ""personal responsibility"" keep safe. latter true, personal responsibility tell others cover damn face holes protect me, elected representatives. Thank you. guess Costco trying avoid taking masks medical providers. family working covid testing site still waves shortages. major employers start encouraging employees wear them, others follow suit, first responders healthcare workers may run out.

Okay, I‚Äôm actually going take time break even though know worthless you, personally. (It‚Äôs mostly anyone else who‚Äôs made far thread reason.) 

1) Rape exists. Coercive pregnancies exist. Abortion expensive frequently restricted state. 
2) everyone maintains level economic standing throughout life, especially country medical debt bankrupting life-ruining. 
3) Children US must go school fashion. enforced state, parents punished children attending school. areas enforcing in-person schooling threat withholding funding. Therefore, even children without parents attending schools. 
4) novel pandemic, want people protected possible. Withholding masks isn‚Äôt punishing people see irresponsible poor children poor families exists. also causes pandemic worsen, impacts families also *anyone comes contact them.* So, completely finally demolish argument, tax money wouldn‚Äôt go rewarding poor people (quelle horreur), would going ensure US (of assume part) doesn‚Äôt suffer *even more* *novel pandemic.* 

I‚Äôll go even say it‚Äôs telling response accusing saying ‚Äúfuck kids‚Äù (which actually nicer distillation post, really ‚Äúfuck families teachers anyone come contact with) attempt insult calling poor. big retort. cost higher be, able get mask Amazon $31.50 3 pairs P100 2091 filters $34.63. sellers purchased still stock.

I'm seeing DHS understand fit testing really is. basically slap mask you, make sure big small (which case people), sign paper send way. states make illegal strike, jail seize pension so. wife teacher friends terrified. thought downvotes he‚Äôs advocating masks. Economic duress It‚Äôs pandemic keep safe everyone else get fucked. No, topic people dying

No, wrong sub. sub r/Coronavirus. Understood, know official Spanish authorities classify COVID death?

We know latest CDC report US 6% deaths occurred due COVID alone. Meaning 94% people died something else made worse COVID.

What's COVID death Spain?  Unfortunately developing technology first equate widely implemented. SpaceX mean get ride rocket. 

But case, tech science nothing new, even third world countries without domestic capacity could contract wanted to. International Air Transport Association

So airline trade association wants countries life border restrictions... think agree special times require special emergency rules. WWII special rules place war effort curfews rationing. see current circumstance equally urgent. Uruguay, south america, flu vaccine vaccination plan 2020 executed 1.000.000 flu shots season, 500.000/600.000 last year. Uruguay ok far comes covid, tried get flu cases possible, specially among risk population (including health personnel). 

Uruguay 3.5M population. good still. still small constant trickle dead people

On average 250 people per day die Sweden. One two Covid related deaths per day pretty irrelevant big picture. Heart diseases cancer kill way way people.

That said corona situation needs monitored restrictions still place.  He's pretty consistent messaging months now. trust it. expect return semblance normalcy April. Next summer going blast. Welcome America personally, fine. city ended rebounding okay Correct, 10th worst 190 countries. fifty times deaths Scandinavian countries. problem! Cool Flow Masks becoming available everyone banning exhaust valve masks. double wear surgical exhaust certain exemptions states based religion personal beliefs. transmit fat redditors I'll lose votes. Almost deaths AIDS, AIDS nothing concerned about. Also high blood pressure life forfeit! No, realistic. Look, Fauci‚Äôs job give hope... holidays winter flu season economics failing... reason approved baseball everyone knows it‚Äôs bad idea players Stockholm. like anyone cares restrictions anymore. Schools open two weeks usual summer break, people going back work. Last week reported least amount new cases since beginning pandemic, trend looks like continue week. covid ‚â† covid.

Yes, lot people Sweden randomly died got covid. nothing covid! think entirely reasonable lay low put lot measures place keep virus bay time being. Keep low theres vaccine. havent heard plan event theres vaccine (which fair looks like likely be). places like New Zealand plan deal fact either stay like forever deal virus forever? That's irrelevant lying. Stop spreading false information. 

(See comment fake news article post details.) dunno everyone entire family tree including 3 existing conditions. met young people age dont high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, anemia, COPD, asthma, poor immune system hell things once. exactly rare. Netherlands, still think facemasks work.

So masks mandated all, anywhere Netherlands? talking Covid flu deaths. talk total deaths causes per week. way doesn‚Äôt divulge whole ‚Äúwhat someone terminal cancer gets Covid death bed‚Äù ‚Äúwhat states aren‚Äôt counting deaths home‚Äù ‚Äúwhat states limiting testing deliberately keep Covid cases deaths down‚Äù ‚Äúwhat hospitals getting paid Covid patients?‚Äù ‚Äúbut count flu Covid deaths differently‚Äù

Total deaths causes avoids descend pointless arguments didn‚Äôt break rules Yeah already they're pretty scarce. exactly got mess begin with. many workplaces spring banned face masks didn‚Äôt want scare customers Thanks. didn‚Äôt know. You‚Äôre free buy houses landlords redistribute free. play devil‚Äôs advocate, N95‚Äôs reserved healthcare workers, particularly covid units, surrounded airborne loads virus 8+ hours day. teachers room full distanced, masked children may may covid. That‚Äôs accidents happen within miles home. gamble you‚Äôd really want take? teachers aren‚Äôt even given option deciding whether they‚Äôre willing bet absolutely underlying issue. problem seems discrepancies countries reporting recording numbers relevant watchlist (remember, Orange County made list despite public data suggesting nowhere close deserving that‚Äî that‚Äôs undoubtedly spurred recent change). probably switch another system least deal next major wave infection coming shortly weather cools down. It‚Äôs criminally negligent also OHSA violation. I've it. mass protests agaisnt kind people Trump presidency allowed Whitehouse? 

Everything like discovered trove anti-matter decided would great idea transport earth. complete mischaracterization article says. JFC people stupid.

The article says greater viral load, likely patient contagious. Also, viral load changes infection progresses, get better viral load testing, improve contact tracing get ahead contagious people. 

This 90 percent people testing positive carried barely virus, poor test would ‚Äòidentify‚Äô infected. people could subsequently increase viral load become contagious. can't put metal microwave yet though  Anyhow, great hear good news trusted source mean, die else would die you? don‚Äôt know exact percent would ‚Äúright‚Äù, I‚Äôm expert. think would need based excess deaths normal hospital occupancy.

They‚Äôre picking ton mild asymptomatic cases days people losing minds ‚Äúspikes‚Äù cases ‚Äúgoing up‚Äù way know numbers increased testing. CDC says get tested you‚Äôre showing symptoms *even you‚Äôve exposed* cases may start going artificially down.

Basically case numbers doesn‚Äôt tell us much except much testing we‚Äôre doing. think middle ground. need realistic vaccine expectations it‚Äôs impact timeline getting back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. likely vaccine ready start 2021, phased roll focusing risk groups first, think healthcare workers, elderly. read vaccine(s) require two doses well effective everyone get two doses phased roll it‚Äôs still looking like social distancing measures need remain place least first half 2021.

Additionally, can‚Äôt expect everything go 100% smoothly. think vaccine looking promising Fauci wouldn‚Äôt speak wasn‚Äôt, still potential unknown/unforeseen issues pop up. Cautious optimism needed.  Id say 60 percent majority 'regular ass people' don‚Äôt understand mandate- enforce it? can‚Äôt shop proving you‚Äôve vaccine? get schools require records could mandate force anyone else? Mandated injections fly even pro vax crowd. Hasn‚Äôt giving message vaccine end year general public wont access another half year year? don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs contradictory flip flopping says vaccine safe effective trust it. Trump much 2/3 nation pre-existing conditions, still problem. think understood point whatsoever. starters, never implied matter much life disease steals. point drop deaths COVID spike say anything many people died COVID, relevant. said literally point making. Saying look drop deaths later implying spike deaths matter even out, least mislead people that. city average 100 deaths year, spike 100 people zero rest year, matter, matters period time unexplainable enormous increase deaths, would anomalous still relevant stat. can't say, oh wait over, see many overall deaths happened, city would still look normal. take, correctly interpreting stats final number explaining meaning behind number. would come work wearing one refuse take file complaint unsafe work conditions keep filing gets denied gets approved. Nothing wrong good KN95 mask. tool used calculate odds:  state plates started around March. noticeable increase state plates. People want flight record traveling drive avoid quarantines. 

I've driven highway every day years never seen many state plates March lockdowns started....Or plates matter sudden... ""confusing"", ""stupid"". managers ""idiots"". sick anyone balls say tbh covid done wonders showing us secret eugenicists hiding loads dead people

I mean, would say Ebola, MERS, Hepatitis ""behave differently thousands viruses observed?"" Keep mind: I'm comparing COVID-19 viruses directly...I'm simply saying possible new virus different despite things like mortality following predictable pattern matches viruses.

I'm concerned post-virus syndromes, opposed immediate death. We've seen COVID-19 especially deadly (as Ebola MERS, example)...but still know virus impact human body long-term.

Yea dont agree protest, people allowed Express views without government prosecution. legislation need clarification send everything worker's comp. issue serving people klutz... N95 allowed university campus either.

Don‚Äôt safe! accommodating! enough everyone. bad someone use act make America produce like war effort. might hurt stock market something election. Rushing vaccine brought many ways siphon money of. really lucky every year even less. early stages Pandemic, CDC recommended mask wearing. think Fauci asked specific advice, CDC official, basically said knew shortage PPE, manufactured Asia longer reliable source (both shutdowns manufacturing Asia due COVID, using supplies themselves, obvious reasons).

Even today nearly impossible go store US buy Clorox wipes. partly due early hoarding, secondarily fibrous material used wipes moved production n95 masks healthcare workers.

How person using N95 help healthcare workers? Well CDC basically answered early faulty advice, afraid person would hoard supply masks needed frontline providers.

Once shortage N95 masks became evident, companies like Lowes, Home Depot, etc donated contractor grade masks medical workers.

Even hard source N95 masks (*go check Amazon: Prioritized organizations front lines responding COVID-19*), even contractor grade masks short supply, raw materials shifted production medical grade masks.

I home construction project last year bought N95 masks Home Depot. One worn (sanding drywall mud) used early on, unused one still case donated local hospital, March, guarantee used it, along box unopened surgical gloves sent along.

Now, K95 masks easily, surgical masks, types cloth masks. cloth mask choice Proper Cloth one, fitted two layers cotton (continuing silver fiber) nylon filter, washable. studies shown two layer fabric mask, simple surgical mask, work fine, need wear N95 mask public.   hard grasp social environment hypothetical 10-20% population 10 scale interaction frequency. Maybe that's college kids, maybe that's low-income people choice work.

If data portrayal correct, means groups friends co-workers seen severe exposure among peers. may true exceptional cases, like poultry packaging plants.

The personal experience would vary dramatically age group. middle-aged people, would talking high fraction peers dying severely drawn-out recovery. would hope groups disproportionately younger, would consistent mortality trends last \~1-2 months particular. Yeah, word novel scare people enough. almost like call ""alien"" that's kind level unknownness we're at. We've dealing viruses evolved along humans hundreds, even thousands years, lately thinking species we've basically conquered disease, realizing we've essentially little creatures living whole lives one pool organisms break natural environmental barriers pools exposed viruses divergent path evolution. going continue happen frequently world climate regulation systems move hypostasis thanks carbon emissions.

The graph shows steady decline 1990 2020, covid causing highest bump upwards death compared years it.

As well, graphic DEEPLY flawed. 

It comparing 9 months 2020 12 months 1990 2019, something simply cannot do. 

The 2020 bump even bigger done correct, meaning deaths 2020 counted. Super fun fact Argentina, they‚Äôve basically nonstop, pretty legit lockdown ~170 days madness I'm however worried winter. People huddling together indoors, without protection, combined flu season. schools opened, see.

Yeah, kidding. back school plan reasonably safe disastrous places North America? point surprised like last sentence. Nobody talking epic life going quarantine over. grocery stores converted pickup-only back March.

Italy, France, Brazil multiple large metro areas preclude making inferences using Gu's (excellent) model, regional metro-area breakdowns within European countries like U.S. states.

Generally best way understand virus spreading look city/metro-area data, country-level. Northern Italy hit hard past spring Southern Italy largely spared, whole country shows decline started 3% infection mean regions can't second spike later %.

Basically countries multiple large cities and/or large urban-rural divides find completely unsurprising.

Here % infected levels sampling states according Gu's model, compared date peak deaths reached (or N/A yet reached). picked 15 states random (assigning #1-51 alphabetical order using random number generator site) assured I'm cherry picking.

**Hawaii**: Peak reached 9/1. Total infected 9/1: 3.9%  
No clear peak daily deaths projected model (looks like pretty static growth November).

**Iowa**: Peak reached 9/1. Total infected 9/1: 13.9%  
Future peak projected around 9/25. Expected total infected around 17.5%.

**Kansas**: Peak reached 9/1. Total infected 9/1: 7.1%  
Future peak *might* projected right around 11/1. Expected total infected around 10.9%.

**Maryland**: Peak reached 4/25. Total infected 4/25: 5.1%  
(This one's quite different! think good case showing distancing interventions play partial role too.)

**Massachusetts**: Peak reached 4/24. Total infected 4/24: 10%

**Minnesota**: interesting one peak deaths per day basically held constant 4/26 6/10. Total infected ranges period 2.8% 4.9%.  
Note that, unlike states retreated peak, Minnesota projected elevated long tail daily deaths. projected slope slowly thru Nov 1 time cumulative infections projected 13%.

**Missouri**: Peak reached 9/1. Total infected 9/1: 6.4%  
Note state one big peak lots little ones ever since. appears consistent ceiling expect distancing behavioral interventions able do: delay spread they're defeating virus.

**New Hampshire**: Peak reached 5/14. Total infected: 2.8%  
The fact left one know I'm honest you, NH one lowest density states Union easily one worst trying interpret patterns. certainly possible interventions play primary role low density, low population state like (although reputation, they're supposed bunch freedumb loving slobs, will). Also worth mentioning 7-day average peak 8.3 dealing low, therefore noisy error-prone, numbers here.

**New Jersey**: Peak reached 4/20. Total infected: 14.5%

**North Dakota**: Peak reached 9/1. Total infected 9/1: 8%  
No clear peak projected thru Nov 1. Expected total infected Nov 1: 14.3%

**Ohio**: Peak 5/24 3.2% total infected similar ""heightened long tail"" MN. Thru Nov 1 expected total infected projected 10.4%. Based model fact whole state still 15% surprised see outbreaks Ohio fall become key story going Election Day.

**Oklahoma**: Peak possibly reached 8/29 9% (high uncertainty projections ahead).

**South Carolina**: Peak reached 7/27. Total infected: 14.1%

**Texas**: Peak reached 7/30. Total infected: 16.1%

Lower population lower density states notwithstanding, shows strong pattern peak reached 10% 20% total infection lasting (e.g. future daily deaths projected remain close 0) retreat disease.

It's interesting mention 'proof'... think 'proves' anything itself, displaces behavioral/policy interventions reach durable peak.

Since mentioned varying cumulative % infected projections differing southern northeast states, also bears reinforcing we're talking event reaching appears ""burnout peak"" (others call herd immunity, sure that). ""Peak"" mean ""no one ever gets again"", means pattern growth hits ceiling rate new harm observed starts retreat. still varying end-state results (southern states higher total % infected) doubt role behavioral interventions might play here... they're driver ""burnout peak"" factor which, based available data, real.

It's interesting linked Gu's model playing around really got onboard this. see showing consistently across different states different degrees severity public policy interventions. Gu pretty vocal there's something real going 15-20% burnout threshold distancing, masks, lockdowns explain alone primarily. He's adamant, BTW, mean things play *no* role - role basically overrated. people vested interest getting ""vaccine"" November cut corner anything so. Didn‚Äôt CDC come say actually 9,000 something deaths directly caused Covid? others due complications? put like yesterday something it‚Äôs popping everywhere social media outlets.

First mention drug: ‚Äòthey tried one study, one showed:
‚Äú‚ÄôNational Institutes Health (NIH) announced launching outpatient trial hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) azithromycin treatment ofCOVID-19. month later, agency announced closing trial lack enrollment 20 2000 patients recruited.‚Äù


The article also two drugs ‚Äúexpected impart greater benefit.‚Äù better ‚ÄúMay‚Äù

The drugs, suggested listed, greater benifit need many warnings them. Also, worthy note, references HCQ article warnings (in paragraph) citations. 

‚ÄúHCQ approved US Food Drug Administration 1955, used hundreds millions people worldwide since then, sold counter many countries, well-characterized safety profile raise undue alarm., Although asymptomatic QT prolongation well-recognized infrequent (&lt;1%) complication HCQ, possible setting acute illness symptomatic arrhythmias could develop.

It's astonishing companies organizations think way. Buying second home necessarily privilege. stuck water decade first house lost $100k time. I'm glad able get rid crises.

For many landlords simply unable sell previous house. Many landlords better tenants screwed instead. Investments risky multiple houses necessarily investment. U right many non-Americans wonder many Americans view 1st Amendment sacrosanct. cases like this. 

Facebook certainly pull post would private entity would USG able arrest posting said information fall exemptions 1st Amendment.  Haha coming american! Trump's fault... Wait second.... us....

Choice B please? second week schools started. really hoping good results 36 (our current week) next one too. also hoping warm September read newspapers :) Weather might side!  agree class action idea, think lawyers currently amassing client base. makes sense certain putting strongest cases first. get one two strong wins/settlements start filing cases. shows intent litigate. Insurance settle first claims drive home bad-faith settlement claims insurance companies bully little less. see costs going try settle file bankruptcy. 

If lawyers start bringing claims arise, run risk putting weaker cases first. makes attorney look weak places poor negotiating positions clients. also may set negative precedent stronger claims go trial. discovered fire hot burns used scare predators. makes humans human US could stayed international coalition insurance policy, opt make political statement pandemic. Choice B is.  Relative dinosaurs went through, maybe.

 contexts, nearly 850k people died far year, 180k US. There's nothing ""relatively well"" 180k dead Americans. Sounds like lot jealous people go real estate Yeah we're going again? Ok. know literally nothing scandinavian countries except saunas numbers released. check worldometer see sweden versus denmark looks pretty damn ugly though. testing sweden low compared many countries too. necessarily trouble. DEA puts shadow limits every pharmacy. numbers depend many drug normally order month. might able order little month number gradually increase, maybe hard cap can‚Äôt go over.

Here‚Äôs fun part: none spelled law anywhere, DEA won‚Äôt share information decide limits, can‚Äôt know limits unless hit them. It‚Äôs fun little thing DEA threatening drug wholesalers fines arrests don‚Äôt enforce limits. mad wrong people. I'm talking small time landlords, multi lateral corporations btw give credit. You‚Äôre incorrect every way possible aggressively stupid arrogant one be. suck confidence! 

Kudo! employees motto.

This entire USA‚Äôs motto. people don‚Äôt want ‚Äúsnitch‚Äù company dumps toxic waste river, friend embezzles money. choose friendship right thing, friendship loses every time. 2 weeks! doesn‚Äôt make sense treat country might areas greatly increased spread infection.

Also, non aids google? hard check hair places legally open.

I want fucking representative act hypocritical. provide service like business, want government provide everyone home? Antibody tests trash. easy. lol, exhausted. Like farmer, coal miner. stupidity ignored, outvoted. rest up, let's flush turds couple months. fun take masks reason whatsoever talk buddies said break room. really wish work would start writing shit ain‚Äôt cute.

I eat hella early avoid everyone. Sure, government fund guy buying investment property probably saving 19 plus years. angry wrong people, government wants.

What government forced keep working 4 months get paid still pay bills.

The government either five money people need pay rent also give mortgage moratorium landlords renters can't pay. Seriously. Cold &amp; flu spreading types events well documented covid. Ask anyone regularly goes camping festivals.

Sure, covid dangerous, that‚Äôs alarming *rate* spread easy test, they're thing.

1. people immune, harder virus ""look"" find host.
2. people's behavior restricted law, harder virus transmitted.
3. risk inconvenience people face, limit behavior.

Herd immunity exists particular environment - culture, living conditions, behavior, opportunity party affect transmissivity virus. presume that, whole, herd immunity reached 70%, implying that, nothing, person infected virus would infect 3 others R(t) = 1.

But: 25% population Florida immune, restrictions all, transmission would fall 25%. go R(0) = 3 R(t) = 2.25 nothing.

If mandatory restrictions reduced transmission 1/3, falls R(t) = 1.5.

If voluntary behavior means people legal activities outside household 60% much, falls R (t) = 0.9.

In herd, specific time, temporary herd immunity.

If immune population Florida includes e.g., 50% super-spreaders make e.g., 80% transmission (in example) 20% cases ‚Äî people either can't take precautions work closely people, refuse thus would pass lot disease immune, 25% immunity means super-spreading events would fall 50%, R(t) falls 3 3√ó((0.75 √ó 0.2) + (0.5 √ó 0.8)) = 1.65 instead 2.25, 45% drop.

If that's case, restrictions voluntary behaviors need reduce transmission opportunities 45% cumulatively achieve R(t) 0.9.

Those numbers could wrong indeed, plausible route explain waves infection even legislation remains constant. aaand guess I'm getting pharmaceuticals anymore. Well, thats majority us think sweden.
Why cant stay country one year. I‚Äôm phone gym I‚Äôll look last month two later. seem knowledgeable though surely must known nursing home abnormality skewed early numbers terms death rate. hospitals definitely didn‚Äôt get inundated, maybe terrible hospitals treatment options? Banning teachers wearing N95 masks bought reason besides optics beyond petty. Honestly I‚Äôm sure Mitch McConnell even trying pass lawsuit moratorium. get work, lot places give workers comp. pretty much every state, paid workers comp prevents suing employer, even negligence. else going provide apartments poor young? Imagine trying live NYC apartment buildings..

It starts top. banks grinding mortgages triccles tenants increased rent.. Nobody going provide free housing unless government taking action care keep expectations line, even vaccine approved around then, small number vaccines available healthcare professionals Point said pleasant them? No, actually said people sucked greater good whereas days lot people far selfish care fellow humans. care tiny bubble. realize someone renting second property increasing supply rental properties? 


We discussing someone buying 2nd home rental purposes someone buying property vacation purposes. comparable, one providing service one not.

Should people evicted pandemic, No, let landlords burnt this? fair enough want go back work help businesses going festival hardly essential... Makes sad can't see brother Japan... Yeah employer (Costco) started prohibiting n95 masks us fucking confused why? argument lazy won‚Äôt change filters lmao Thanks posting study. exactly contradictory information I‚Äôm talking about. J'ai remarqu√© √ßa aussi, ce sub est d'une grosse arrogance. Keep mind internet attracts noteworthy stories. plenty people ""neutral"" classroom experience describing. hell would anyone post that? 

We post things matter us. remember something unique them.

It's conspiracy ""reddit political morality play"", whatever means.

Thank you.** follow patients get weekly updates point, including antibody production. people working patients clue vaccine. That's blinded part. However, antibody levels calculated monitored. intial review, data compiled. People reviewing data see antibodies produced, direct interaction participants, avoid accidentally tipping off. That's blind portion. Even unsure vaccine, vaccine producing noticeable affect, idea.

We vaccine related data processed study occurring.  Lol. ""random guy reddit"" refer simply expressed opinion. know - one reddit. say suggest believe Fauci, I'm pretty sure actually bothered ask jumping silly conclusion would explained suggesting value \*opinion\* word leading epidemiologist U.S. way explained N95 masks protect _the wearer_. They‚Äôre designed stop particulates entering wearer‚Äôs lungs. Like you‚Äôre crawling attic. That‚Äôs they‚Äôre sold home improvement stores. enable breaths unrestricted filter breaths. masks create barrier wearer‚Äôs particulates rest world protect _others_ wearer.

If wear N95 mask regular mask top it, you‚Äôd protection directions. What? I'm little confused one. Who's eevee? experience. think might finally starting make dent years sleep deficit. I'm teacher district put N95 list polyester blend gaiters. asked, school nurse simply said reserved medical professionals, I'm sure within authority deny usage teachers purchased own. 

I think important distinction glossed though:

The N95 valves N95 without two different animals. N95 without valves safest masks ""regular"" person use, provided fitted worn properly. ones valves appropriate particular pandemic possibly spread virus wearer, that's huge difference. think feel like explaining it, ban them. would line coronaviruses, likely catch twice season, susceptable next year.

Everyone's attached idea everything virus must *unprecedented.* Deaths take 3-4 weeks infection. 1. Australia US. Im sure even BLM protests there

2. warrant. Hardly Orwellian Friday morning press conference, Oregon State Health Officer Dr. Dean Sidelinger said although individuals tested positive reported attend demonstrations, agency seen large clusters cases gathered evidence transmission they're mostly wearing masks staying outside transmission much tougher. Yes I‚Äôm definitely causing socializing reason virus still alive. OMG COULD SELFISH üò± Justified? Seems bit high. You‚Äôre piece shit lol. Yikes. Article says even uncontacted (as totally isolated, contact modern world) Sentinelese group (the ones killed last guy tried make contact) risk due poachers fishing waters. trying fun enjoy life college shouldn‚Äôt scrutinized much must special circumstance, exact phrase 30 40 percent effective. think talking first vaccine. would say seems good enough start definitely save lives long people still use precautions public. *tested confirmed FDA*, fit actual performance.

An N95 (FDA certified) basically useless wrong size face, bearded. Fit separate (but critically vital ensure) respirator performance. Honestly sounds right, would even infuriating lockdowns politically motivated (although reason that‚Äôs ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù US) ‚Äú‚Ä¶our [the federal government‚Äôs] masks.‚Äù We‚Äôre fucking mess, indeed! Probably kid that‚Äôs never experience healthcare. first serious medical issue, even trip hospital, realize shit bankrupt almost anybody *real* fast. worked great back March. Thank Federal Government! yet, countries wearing masks since January back normal many months now. Funny that... People realizing we, society, fucked hard pandemic. Hard lockdowns didn‚Äôt shit also resulting huge economic fallout. Mask mandates resulted politicized globally used power tripping tool leaders, social distancing resulted disjointed society used relying close contact. Contrary popular opinion, masks aren‚Äôt perfect, lots disadvantages mask wearing, like example people bad breath actually find hard breathe without feeling disgusted, hurt ears little bit wear bit time, facial expression important talking, result lots pollution (especially disposable surgical masks), all, society doesn‚Äôt understand wear mask correctly, like see people wearing disposable mask tens times, people wearing nose/mouth/chin, destroys mask‚Äôs purpose. People realizing hard lockdowns solution, like look countries like Sweden, Pakistan, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Qatar threat COVID mostly gone despite countries much, countries hard lockdowns like France, Spain, Italy, Germany, UK second wave rn, even hard lockdowns. Also, looking countries done lots testing (UAE, Qatar, Singapore, etc.) shows death rate COVID quite low, looking previous point countries suppressed COVID-19 spread without much, gives us bit indication herd immunity threshold (i.e. IFR herd immunity threshold overestimated lots people, results easy fear-mongering media). all, sub finally realized this, lot info COVID. Hot take: Despite cult following, Costco shitty company. difference spread COVID19 controlled Germany via proper government response contact tracing, testing, etc.

[it almost conservative governments suck dealing know else stupid? Basing opinion article title without reading *the first sentence Wisconsin Department Health Services says teachers wear N95 respirators school fall, scientist Duke University says advice makes ‚Äúno sense.‚Äù

It's terrifying people basing understanding things like global pandemics based headline. vaccine nation deserves? I‚Äôd like add even though personally doesn‚Äôt agree mask, he‚Äôs still wearing it. every right scared Covid. seems like he‚Äôs still practicing safety others. people acted like that, we‚Äôd better. They‚Äôre easily available probably provide safety cloth mask. That‚Äôs good enough upgrade cloth KN95. However, I‚Äôm still considering upgrading P100 full face respirator. personal experience bedridden recovering holy fuck, can‚Äôt stop thinking atrophy ICU length time. went bedrest recovering surgery, 4 weeks. glutes atrophied me. agony months months months took able walk without cane hell.

These people dismiss hand consequences severely ill ‚Äúthey‚Äôre dead!‚Äù drive batshit crazy. possible physically ill, pain, etc enough dying would preferable. would take realistic view covid19 deniers terrified take one. necessarily. People feel comfortable driving neighborhoods. They‚Äôre less cautious know are, stops are, congestion usually is, avoid. It‚Äôs easy zone make mistake you‚Äôre autopilot.

Not looking forward There's easy answer. someone dies coronavirus system, coronavirus killed them? contributing factor? count it? 

Obviously coronavirus reason died, sure. that's case cases. someone underlying condition, also caught corona virus, would lived many years without catching it, seems like count to, right? maybe someone really fatal condition killing anyway died happened coronavirus present. Probably count? hard know draw lines. 

This looking 'excess deaths' given time period compared previous year helpful. quantify people died, look many people died May 2020 May 2019 gives pretty good idea much extra deaths coronavirus caused. enough masks kushner start business redistributing them. used thst company buy reserves states could, times even confiscating states (states sectet missions transported armed guards) resell highest bidding states.

In way no. 

Our numbers dealing corona way better league table, glad finally admitted see sports competition. 7 8 countries ""ahead"" Sweden lock hard ...

I trying explain things terms people understand.

What best? 6000 people die 700? 

Say pick method method B regards calamity city. Would prefer meaning 6000 people die B meaning 700 die? 7 8 countries ""ahead"" Sweden lock hard ...

Not sure mean ""hard"" lockdown. IDK countries precisely. 1 month lockdown stuff still open, like home depots. could always go visit friends outside stuff. Loads people sitting outside parks drinking beer ""hard"" lockdown.

After month, stuff started opening again.

It really big deal tbh. sectors took hit like hotels, would taken regardless. doubt Swedish hotels sold lol.

I think many countries similarly. guy wrote that, however, *accidentally* omitted Argentina still less worse major country South America terms covid deaths, 'just' 198 deaths per million inhabitants opposed 371 Ecuador, 393 Colombia, 436 Bolivia, 576 Brazil, 581 Chile 880 Peru.

I seen anyone hail Argentina, whose lockdown obviously working anymore, model, although clearly done less worse neighbours. hailed models usually New Zealand, Australia (where lockdown Victoria succeeded curbing spread virus), northern eastern Europe spring. mentioning would gotten way author's agenda. vaccine pushed Russian, Chinese Trump administration I'm going wait several million people try first. Fauci puts word behind I'm likely faith it. People suffer anorexic typically heart issues, yeah huge risk factor. Like weak/deteriorating heart muscles low BP. Time Unionize. thought FDA approve vaccine that's less 50% effective. Everyone already wearing mask though (in theory) Last remember, sub one follow science. Science opinions, facts expert analysis. Fauci isnt optimistic feels way personally, data driven. didnt wake feel vaccine year. conclusion directly contradicts his. said: ""With said, data suggest mixture behavior change + population immunity responsible recent decrease cases/deaths.""

This consistent heterogenous dispersion models. also mean there's hard cap either, admits well. shifts behavior. contradicts posted - I'm ""failing consider"" factor, I'm saying reasonable call primary posted, results model seem support conclusions, yours. still varying end-state results (southern states higher total % infected) doubt role behavioral interventions might play here... they're driver ""burnout peak"" factor which, based available data, real.

This make sense all. burns lower threshold due behavior modification, immunity reason relative places spread widely. literally opposite. seems like playing semantics try downplay impact NPI's. lol totally nailed Average QB average mind know specific state, said punishment *striking*. quit want. know word carries negative connotation. Trying responsible save lives really shouldn‚Äôt called that. it‚Äôs fit tested might well wear surgical since it‚Äôs going filtering found thirty people proven reinfected Japan. shows people get reinfected proves herd immunity can't work. one number articles people getting reinfected. proven get sick figured long immunity lasts. sure know immune forever. Lol. found proof people reinfected somehow I'm making things up? I'm obviously found articles people getting reinfected. Even herd immunity ever going possibly work like let's pretend like know people get reinfected (you're already good job that) amount people die trying create herd immunity would crazy. FYI reach herd immunity 70% country would immune. 15.2% people age 65 19 50% non elderly Americans preexisting conditions 40% Americans obease. looked numbers think I'm making up. many people die herd immunity? even achieved.


If sure herd immunity working go read Spain. trying right going ""Why Costco staff wearing scrubs?"" problem n95 masks filters incoming air outgoing air. wearing covid, still much spreading around, less mitigated wearing standard mask Argentina mess covid, currency already rapidly declining value pandemic. probably using covid reason try keep people protesting looks like defying lockdown protesting anyway. job tries stop wearing proper safety equipment, fucking wear anyway. can't imagine company would survive lawsuits firing employees following federal health mandates. Well exact words lol. closed disinfect equipment surfaces. think right call time. knew prevalent surface transfer not. hope dies. is. bought N99 fabric mask (not cheap) pollution last year wash occasionally. filters needed. take upvote. I‚Äôm rush go anywhere, hope whenever time quick involves little medical intervention possible. Aaah, get it.

But yea, figure people blaming 5G teh Corona, also HIV, HSV, HPV, etc?

I always wondered TV Radio station got assigned WHOR KUNT, reserved unavailable CORES. .....that‚Äôs still snitching absolute #1 post Reddit. can't really call whatever BLM makes ""protest"", riots need stop. right fo peacefully assemble, burn loot.  Thank efforts Right. people presume profoundly insightful able know, certainty, entire group complete strangers think, also motivates them.

Get high horse, broheim. Accept people share different opinions, certainty regarding others think think unless ask them, lazy, blanket presumptions beneficial one. mean none us experts, tagged exceptions, excess deaths 15% normal would warranting action? 25% local area? I'm trying get non-educated opinion using guidelines proposed 

For perspective, roughly 8000 people die US every day, would move somewhere 9200 10000 math right oh, course looking smaller areas know one randomly pick.

I wish CDC would better job telling give certain rules. think lot people would accept basically said anywhere that's testing positive certain amount test people symptomatic test used places everyone cut testing back 20% extra ones go schools nursing homes whatever case maybe instead making decision without much explanation.

The would true aspects federal government, example saying college students remain College even face outbreaks. sounds pretty terrible unless they're trying isolate healthy people get infected recovered sent back home artificially inflate herd immunity. Well might little complicated explain people especially moms sent freshman across country, level explanation would get whole lot better buy company doesn‚Äôt want protected feel safe, I‚Äôd quite Exactly incompetence referring to? American Journal Medicine fake received antibody test? know it‚Äôs extra cost, though I‚Äôve seen low $20 free. would give doctors answers, wouldn‚Äôt speculating whether it. allowing vents important community protection. 

Vented masks reserved people dealing known positive cases. probably stay conspiracy cave pretend neutral really conservative windbag. enough everyone.

Link reference? Everyone need one. schools shown incredible hot spots (who knew? /s) people work allowed use best PPE get hands - districts really going much provide additional protection. also lot bots. Like shit ton. I've noticed huge uptick trying discredit vaccine. month stack start ... ya doin?  nearly inconsiderate refusing wear mask protect others catching deadly virus. someone that, deserve called dick. one. Except OSHA requires anyone uses respirator regular part work fit tested yearly. they're saying think Costco worried liable employees wearing respirator every day hit OSHA violation one fit tested.

In case hospital workers, fit tested specific model/size. nurse doctor comes mask they're using one fitted for, leaving hospital liable. 

I think OSHA restrictions loosened significantly right regards fit testing, likely reasonings. (Which probably pushed lawyers concerned sued) leaders time duty anything even perceived breaking rules. way way way conscientious safe average every day joe. 

If mayor town banned indoor dining, absolutely, positively, go engage indoor dining \*another\* town, regardless technically safe technically rules. 

Leaders need symbols examples time. Anything looks even remotely like ""You guys can't this, still can"" completely out. 

In case, public going see mayor saying ""Dining restaurants isn't' safe, shut down"" turning right around dining restaurant. terrible idea obvious : *don't engage behavior prohibited people doing.* picked 10 pack drpuri seem real deal. P100 filters stocked - panic buy beginning pandemic. One best decisions I've ever made life.

I managed buy Amazon normal price. think distinction antivaxxers use children vaccinated don‚Äôt ‚Äúdevelop autism‚Äù really says lot parents would rather dead child measles polio autistic child kinda fucked. 

My thought process continually cdc especially DHS walked back guidelines tested, areas virus. whitehouse come compromised credibility public eyes. It‚Äôs starting really seem DHS CDC compromised either directly thru appointed leaders indirectly political pressure. 

All create tension confusion public best. worst protects business employers litigation ‚Äúfollow‚Äù guidelines, example test people come contact someone positive??????????. frees protect employees worst maybe fire either getting sick wanting come work risk getting sick. 

This obvi ooonion interpretation happening still going accidents less driving mean less accidents. Even people still driving it‚Äôs hard imagine driving more. Speaking personal experience, know haven‚Äôt driven nearly much prior March Well, end game herd immunity. like always been. Let's hope get smart slowing spread safe, proven, effective vaccine available. kinda amazing many people favor old fashioned route herd immunity even know long term risks contracting disease. Agree. 

I always wear mask going stores really done lot keep safe possible. little interaction person friend see wait like 10 days make sure I‚Äôm sick. 

Luckily live state part good lately although schools opening don‚Äôt think gonna count much anymore sadly I‚Äôm talking manufacturing base decimated starting 1990‚Äôs take decades bring drug manufacturing back US even can. think it‚Äôs important note bias that‚Äôs inherent even knowing story. probably 1 person lost 7 family members every million people position, little interaction virus. news attracted story individual experiences unique tragedy many individuals experience mundane daily life.  forget memory cells cell immunity well. well known german Virologist (C.Drosten) expects immunity til end 2021. click bait title. Thus contributing misinformation confusion, shown multiple comments post show people think DHS, DHS, see? strive ensure accurate information misleading titles misinformation per rules sub. flu shot give flu. 

You may get flu anyway, vaccine gave flu. Blame fucking POTUS this.

Or ""politics"" countries ""manage"" pandemic provide measure lockdown.

Your orange dyed stupid fuck selfish POTUS shit.

Lock fucker less people die. FDA full potential whistle blowers would want perceived heroes. concerned political pressure either. Typical modern Conservative thought process. Agreed, hope right. should‚Äôve descriptive. won‚Äôt cheap much longer US. get fucked Yes. Absolutely. valid points. would like point extinction disease isn‚Äôt people mean talk herd immunity. Well, isn‚Äôt exactly true, strawmanned often is. Totally normal country. Dead starvation Dead covid? Ive read we‚Äôve proven reinfections, though. herd immunity won‚Äôt anything kill people give survive long lasting health issues. survive get reinfected reinfected... chances survival point...? social distancing better mask. lockdowns better social distancing.
But thing Americans believes would help, masks. Define self testing. worried mask that's N95, wear N95. 

It really simple. circle. agree ur points China medical agencies. 

I think, whimsically, get pass mask statement March. believe learned virus works guidelines would tweaked. think trend get much conservative distance, mask wearing, transmission. doesn‚Äôt make sense become ‚Äúmore lax‚Äù gather information 

Again $.02 least attendee poor unfortunate interacted him. could easily been. ""Widely available"" mean different things different people, too. talking US first world whole world? state spikes 10% positivity again, would vaccine directed there?

I'm looking things terms ""what make travel without quarantine processes norm?"" think vaccine ""widely available"" enough that's thing North America new year. Thanks article. N95 masks also protect wearer, since valve exhale remember Miami literally made pickup basketball illegal Spring. really come long way  story definitely *coincidentally* true people flu vaccine 40-60% effective good years. Great, vaccine imminent. long confer immunity? become yearly-dose thing like flu shot one-of like vaccines?

It's fantastic news regardless. [Here's ya  Yes, thing call ""Sverigebilden"" (Image Sweden). level mental gymnastics try keep crazy.

Some examples:

- Dying **of** Corona vs. **with** Corona!!! (Like much different Sweden compared comparable countries)
- got elderly homes!!! (Like much different Sweden compared countries)
- Sweden better counting countries!! (No)
- Herd immunity never strategy!! (Yes was)
- Sweden can't compared neighboring countries!! (Similar countries many ways, always compared pre corona)
- Sweden **only** compared Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, etc!! (Basically country deaths per capita)
- list goes on.

Absolutely ridiculous. Nobody:

According chart thumbnail article, vented N95 effective reducing droplets fleece, bandana, cotton1, cotton3, several mask materials

[chart see skeptic could unaffected story. Went week awesome. First I‚Äôve heard term already hate makes sense whatsoever. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs best interests safe vaccine distributed soon possible. curious willing so- called 'weak' end stick. surprised. don‚Äôt know many people willing risk getting plane. also don‚Äôt see many companies eager send workers traveling anytime soon. company used spend millions month business travel. ground close zero. Spot. Fucking. On. That‚Äôs pretty damn perfect summary literature progress trials date.

I‚Äôll also add: one month, Pfizer Moderna already *each* enrolled nearly 20K people respective trials. I‚Äôd foresee people throwing hissy fit interim analysis DSMB resulted premature termination, seems unlikely point given quickly they‚Äôre enrolling. fucking men sad lives misplaced rounding error. rounded 2 dp, know real value used rounded value 0%. could 0.00499% (211 AU) 0.0001 (4).

I ran checks [Maranh√£o, basic age stats Maranh√£o, 6.0% 65, 94.0% 65.

Say IFR ratios 0.05% 1.5% two age groups. seems conservative numbers used first comment.

[Immunoassay population gives 2,830,072 infections population 7,075,181. 40%.

Calculating numbers give 3,877 deaths 3,402 deaths recorded date. calculation overshot official recorded amount 14%.

The big unknown level need herd immunity. Maranh√£o hit 40% infections stopped. FWIW, financial resources scientific manpower spent COVID-19 vaccine probably several magnitudes higher Ebola vaccine. appears found significant difference infection rates masked non-masked groups. Instead drawing conclusion that, among typical populations, mask usage irregular helpful, conclude wore masks properly, would worked. It‚Äôs interesting study seems like flawed conclusion. That's proposed heterogenous model paper everyone using justify 20% HIT.

Let's keep check, please? I've consistent whatever burnout threshold we're seeing 10-20% may may HIT early call HIT. I'm skeptical (more likely, think, might threshold beyond caseload growth still possible hospitalization/severe illness/death much minimal). understand frustrated people proclaim HIT like science already settled, get it, talking them, I've made repeatedly clear.

I'm forced conclude clear, *want* clear, see edits Basically, YYG line academic theory here, not. cherry picking statements, ignoring others, picking overoptimistic conclusion violates academic basis rooted optimism fact.

You've pointed statements claiming I'm ignoring I'm agreeing them, times even directing earlier made point. seems like wishing speaking someone who's ""20% HIT settled science"" ""end interventions nothing"" bandwagon ignoring evidence model SEIR ML layer tuning parameters, based explanation.

Not downplay importance difference, also mentioned historical data. postulated ""burnout % would higher absence interventions"" also lack viral spread even interventions ease mean burnout plays key role. view, low viral activity could deceptively concomitant even low levels barriers transmission (i.e. much gradually improving r&amp;r mobility NY) explode violently.

Well, bringing back around historical data, [look happened mobility gradually improved, pattern viral spread ""low, low, low, low, low, OMG everyone it"". ""low, low, rising, rising, rising, rising, peak, decline, decline"". Depend squint growth June August peak either gradual 50/50 blend convex/cave up, straight linear path. Mind transpired, posted above, mobility barely budged downwards.

So say lack parallel growth viral spread NY mobility improved means nothing heterogeneity model predicts low activity followed extreme growth, I'd like see that's actually observed. cannot seem stop shooting foot.  say hope still means people dying... yeah, attitudes towards US horrible they're bringing themselves. Self-sabotage time üá∫üá∏ need trump office, he's going kill us true. vaccine 40 60% effective strains match. not, worse (for example, 29% last season, 19% 2014/2015, shameful 10% 2004-2005). half people US take flu vaccine every year, half get flu symptoms anyway (when strains good match) suggesting ton people die, whole, remaining higher levels immunity. That's like saying, ""If let blind people die, population sighted people."" 

If that's goal, let's stop making drugs, doctors, etc. whatever remains herd even stronger. Yeah, say think does. 

There two kinds N95 masks: regular, run-of-the-mill surgical mask give 75-80 percent efficiency, optimally. N95 has, wait it, guaranteed 95 percent filtration, provided fit properly (which way easier fitting surgical N95). 

There situation, cited article citing scientist Duke University, N95 masks better option. 


All said, case surgical N95 could made kindergarten pre-K teachers: ""...or exposed blood high-velocity bodily fluids"" (19:08 approximately) man guys really bad huh?

I care odds literally 10,000 1, risk exists, mitigate it. guys keep fucking around shit. Get damn flu shot able Heavily moderated protect denialists ""open er crowd"" since got laughed subreddit. worst trolls fled there. read right. LOL realize that. Thanks pointing out. guess wanted say there's typically longer lead time getting vaccine market, expedited timeline, hopeful also wary potential consequences. still trusting point time, one played. nonstop revolving door filled controversy past weeks, I'm done listening them. Fair enough, agree points. wanna rude neither, seeing graph without context annoyed little haha
Saludos! Plague still agree this, local hardware store N95's, hurting hospital coast buy use them. Could get doctor's note saying need able wear masks? Like pregnant, doctor's note saying needed wear tennis shoes - something law regarding reasonable accommodation. better us. front-line people like hospital workers, etc. top list. work. People like work home permanently? like no, 10 year lease need use it. drive feel you‚Äôre getting money‚Äôs worth? work productivity remained gotten better worked home. remains #1 constitutional right. üôÑ Chaos. Fascism thrives chaos. Maybe teachers, literally went school educate paid so, infinitely better teachers Zoom worksheets parents homeschooling?

Fuck sub retarded That‚Äôs basically anti-vaxxers conspiracy theorists like guy work ‚Äî flowery language, consistent references overarching ‚Äúthey‚Äù that‚Äôs evil reason, claims absurd things think obvious don‚Äôt need cite it. /r/covid19 science based comments try break concepts down. buying small residential property using income something see less less of. sell property someone live instead.

""mom pop"" rentals something ever use tax money helping. may true, political opportunity use defense production act address issue wide open, literally probably would've HELPED Trump's popularity, regardless. 

He's ignorant, lazy destructive actually fix single thing. he's willing lie tell American people everything much better eyes ears telling is. seem care make potential solutions reality, like he's happier comfortable lying it. curious. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre Phoenix. I‚Äôve seen, Tucson well. haven‚Äôt seen anyone wear mask public spaces. Gov Reynolds help, Trumpian cult. mandate force schools opening scrapped may godsend. fix everything. protest government says okay! protest really swear guys. government sanctioned energy outlet.

you freedom speech australia. even know freedom means.  making transition british colony chinese colony, pretty entertaining watch.  Coglione. users use computer DAILY 10-20 years, yet still call help accidentally resized windows.

And apologize, really do. call tech person know resized window last week. Lol. Sorry. got scared. :-) It‚Äôs mandatory us wear now. beginning months ago. I‚Äôm shocked currently testing teachers way healthcare field treated n99 masks?  cares himself. shit president care people. Rise politics read science readily available. Healthcare joke America. wrong laugh idiots? sensible well thought ramble though likely spot on. Yikes! Could bar get lower? ""My state slightly better states handling pandemic worst, country that's handling worst."" offering protection

Who told that? Show lies coming from. first impression runny nose isn‚Äôt related covid usually covid dries anything  Denial always easier acknowledging facts subsequently updating view things. terrible habit think us normal people checking it. cant wait ghost town probably around mid November. election stop caring relationship Trump vaccine hopefully getting wider wider release around then. original case numbers March/April dramatically low compared reality. people estimate 8-10 times higher. France peaked around 5000 cases per day officially, likely experiencing closer 40-50 thousand. 

Remember late March/Early April nobody quite knew disease, testing widespread. also lot shit tests market work. Yes, front-load hypothesis could bring Deaths - Causes goes notably average ""when over"". Deciding ""over"" long time frame look ""recovery"" effect conclusions draw.

As noted thread, early measurements Years Life Lost (YLL) found 11-14 years average (varied sex) Italy (I believe) -- study kinda disputes ""they going die minute anyway"" hypothesis, guess we'll see?  likely sales soaring, use. People fear following mandate won‚Äôt find stores (toilet paper situation over). 

I doubt nationwide mandate unless situation deteriorates lot isolated outbreaks. Mandates likely specific situations specific areas new outbreaks. example public transport specific city. Rules thee, me.

Pro-life people often become temporarily pro-choice unwanted pregnancy. Utah already pulled people driving excessively fast last year.  Yeah love commute across Atlantic Ocean every day. think cluster fuck can't get worse...it keeps going. Apparently think Walmart CVS make masks stores... it‚Äôs like CHAZ protestors wanting make sustainable food... annexing Whole Foods nearby. Got 100pack powecom kn95s set while.

That said I‚Äôm gonna job site weeks, initial weeks stay shows guys clearly bare minimum. Hangar bays open I‚Äôm going w kn95s come fall winter I‚Äôll wearing respirators nothing else. Extremely glad FU money tell shove feel doesn‚Äôt jive w policy. Poor Dead. Several vaccines development COVID repurposed vaccines designed MERS first SARS. Technically they've also development years. hear you. Former teacher turned nurse here. much would love able help either field right know needed, also immunocompromised. time life I'm actually grateful fact lack PPE, also lack PPE both, anti-intellectualism running rampant leads lack respect former colleagues still working. 

Yes, money tight, family safe close. cannot even fathom would like situation forced work, would already tanked remaining kidney function, high risk complications covid. Lol supposed eat Air versus droplets. size two astronomical. Cloth helps hold back lot dangerous stuff. Actually read article, else made comment. voted reported. one demanding better...I can't believe one major platforms Joe (I'm Trump) Biden... I‚Äôm idiot course understand that. people sub try put words people‚Äôs mouths act like know everything.

There people watch news feed fear doom without looking real facts information prove advancements month may turning point pandemic. 

I‚Äôm saying people aren‚Äôt entitled opinions feed doom try spread doom accomplishing try prove others you‚Äôre right? glad I'm staying home exectly, safe effective vaccine arrive, give time. said, I'm going wait several million people try first, get vaccinated later on. Hey cool. think family member print up. Thanks! Thanks that, doubled gaiter sound pretty solid, harder remove masks general use. Still say, definitely better nothing. Could please point towards non CCP controlled news sources change mind? seemingly credible outlets, BBC, Rueturs, WSJ, etc say thing supporting statements way conclude 'safe effective' Phase 3 end year. Interim results EUAs looking at. Sounds like something taken context again... certainly isn‚Äôt magic, air per person movement air dilutes virus much inside. takes 5 mins degrade half virus, dispersal would act much faster wouldn‚Äôt large factor. don‚Äôt think disagreeing something means I‚Äôm deciding what‚Äôs good everyone. said don‚Äôt agree women arrested trying mobilize protest. Compared southern states think data pretty good. Yeah article Wisconsin Department Health Services, Federal Department Homeland Security. That's thing Buddhism God. Buddha actual person established main causes suffering, taught people way life eliminate suffering. thru actions towards living beings. hhdl says ""suffering make angry. type anger moves us toward wrathful compassion take action end suffering"". always look voiceless around give voice. wearing better mask make sense!!!! scientists saying this? screwed. kind logical thinking that? 260 million would throwing death lottery someone like Elon musk buy another boat. Yeah, Anthony Fauci *long* legend medical community, there‚Äôs reason think wouldn‚Äôt stay long feels help. don‚Äôt think disagreeing something means I‚Äôm deciding what‚Äôs good everyone. said don‚Äôt agree women arrested trying mobilize protest. disgusting fascist state.  want assume crochet/lace mask ppl anti-maskers want say ""look I'm complying"" nobody stupid enough think helps. I'm saying use word. I'm saying meaning fucking clear denying boneheaded. care like flavor connotations word. nothing would see means censoring silencing.

What FUCK think **you're** doing? hypocrisy thick here. denying common meaning word, insisting words, like associated connotations? Complaining word word offensive *is* tantamount advocating censorship.

I'm one using word snitch describe ordinary rule-followers ""concerned citizens."" But:

* wearing masks public literally law places, ""snitch"" meets proposed strict definition much time
* broader meaning everyone acknowledges
* want argue ""snitch shaming"" right way directly, rather arguing definitions.

This type argument words way common, consider terrible aspect culture. People argue words actually used misleading objectively wrong way. Unfortunately, also downsides people tend exaggerate understate stuff, boring would things two things style all? Yes know guidance shit aren‚Äôt PPE shortages now? least U.S. stayed days got IV fluid, think would‚Äôve done fine,‚Äù said Dr. Brobson Lutz, infectious disease doctor **formerly** staff Ochsner...

Fixed them. Can't staff publicly critical employees. 

/r/byebyejob Looks like exponential growth. upvoted posts positive Fauci. posts up/downvotes. Downvotes show sub pro-good news. would hard prove individual cases, think something could done major outbreaks close-quarter workplaces like meat packing plants. think difference ""having"" versus ""having readily available"". I'm inclined believe Fauci, logistics production distribution, entirely possible available general public second half 2021. Trump pretty vengeful narrow minded. Teachers mostly liberal. could definitely see punishment supposedly brainwashing kids liberal nonsense. may case definitely feels like something he‚Äôd least OK told Stephen Miller it‚Äôs way go. mean? Petty best. Malicious worst. Y‚Äôall redditors vindicated lmao.

It‚Äôs good masks saved actual medical workers. direct quote Dr. Fauci article:
‚ÄúIf making decision vaccine, you‚Äôd better sure good evidence safe effective,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm concerned political pressure.‚Äù

Definitely made feel bit better too. deadly disease dipshit. sort good news computer phone far know. even good news post bring doomers.

People still find way manage shit trusted guy (Fauci) who‚Äôs done nothing bring optimism feed us facts! There‚Äôs winning Yeah, COVID came along government let kill thousands people.

Well done. Going 3M site, appears specific one longer production, resembles 6502 model (with downward oriented exhaust).

There also 3D printed clip-on filter pieces 6200 series (With forward facing exhaust), designed hold 2"" square HEPA filter carbon (Here's link clip-on exhaust filter, anyone 6000-series) So, country still thing before? people staying home people acting like nothing wrong? economy rebounded?

I feel like, even publicity Sweden got different things differently, really different countries sense that, bunch people still participating economy. Vulnerable people shopping partying eating restaurants, here. prolonged state waiting vaccine, people taking risks others. here. wrong? actual Swedes thread tell us is? Parts America shut down. We‚Äôve never shut 50 states number deaths would catastrophic nation decades come.

Some biggest loss already still come stories rich beautiful lives. 
Stories never told, memories forever forgotten. 


We lost innovation, ideas, more. 


Not non now, every person lose lose much more. news along positive. Dude Oxford called shot way back May said 80 percent confidence vaccine would effective would ready October. Everyone else sub said two years lucky blah blah blah. Well getting awfully close October looking like Oxford couple others probably ready go. Tennessean here, chiming agree you. governor continues real fuckin doofus thing. Go look youtube @ common, plenty back Jan/Feb ""Cover up, dicknose"". make habit telling people this, best prepared asshole trying pick fight though... sure. didn‚Äôt discuss scenario. course did. He‚Äôs pig anyway. No, vent. disposable mask stiff piece wire top pinch top nose. Fully enclosed. big tourism proportion GDP? take account fact death rate increase medical systems overwhelmed. 

This colossally stupid. I‚Äôd wear one let employer fire me. Let reason let go. Literally home except four trips Disney world. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs hard people STAY HOME. ""First"" implying follow No. Why? KN95s? They're good N95s, they're approved use medical facilities, functionally they'll job. Outdoor transmission common UV Index. makes massive difference. like outdoors magic virus. thing makes outdoors better viral instances frequent wind dispersal UV index, making less likely someone get viral load large enough cause infection far enough way carrier. nullifies capacities making outdoors longer free scrub / sponge virus. Nothing really perfect supplement face shield depending situation. Walmart CVS get masks manufacturers supply hospitals... know distribution works? Agreed. many sub preach destructive mindset normal never going back. probably see normal, aside working home encouraging people wear masks sick, see many major changes coming this. fit media narrative. Also U.N. statement parts world like Africa Asia, real gap wealthier western nations women well looked after. state I‚Äôm skeptical skepticism. sees ulterior motives covid reporting, fails see ulterior motives trump administration‚Äôs efforts downplay pandemic. They‚Äôre trying kill old people improve economy reduce social security payments. Sweden urbanized country, dont understand would ridicilous compare them. would like make perfectly clear aren‚Äôt arguing good faith. Try defend China like, they've become globally despised good reason. Xi (your boss) CCP's days numbered.  measure fear public, think average person take risk seriously enough.  Time tell us right. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre thinking may 10,000 less deaths actually singularly Covid-19,‚Äù Ms. Ernst said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really curious. would interesting know that.‚Äù

Thats article quoted saying. said singularly seems saying 10k people died covid. one thinks article misleading? spelled ""ruins"" wrong. People take time die. Best compare deaths active cases. CDC clarified data update fueling disinformation campaign? main thing get! (63 year old) aunt keeps posting anti-mask stuff Facebook one main arguments ""it affect healthy people bad, elderly sick!"" Like sister, mom, technically elderly 67 likely complications due blood pressure heart.

This aunt become hardcore Trumper suddenly anti-abortion even though like 3. her's totally ok, everyone else immoral. two Covid related deaths per day pretty irrelevant big picture.

And - deaths ""irrelevant"" - preventable unnecessary, irrelevant... unless happens family... right? Troy, BYE! earlier able really. Countries opened up, started going events amusement parks, Sweden 50 people gathering limit throughout entire time since March. Europe locked, measure softer, started opening became strict almost everywhere else.  people lie statistics, people don‚Äôt understand math make bad choices ""3 days ago, picked prescription us filled someone covid-19. danger you, virus last long outside body. However, read this, almost certainly throw pills out. pills, hurry different pharmacist get new pills, trust us more. get new prescription doctor mad rush. fun!"" I've concerned unintended consequences blanket orders. clear, feel bad people can't pay rent. Unfortunately, government (federal) really working solutions problems, bear responsibility pay damage, landlords. Essentially, congress saying: work deal it. 

A lot people commenting idea economics actually work probably anything close small business manage savings/investments. reasonable person would consider risk government requiring pay someone else's rent deciding buy rental property. ‚Äú2 million people die this.‚Äù Biggest hoax history Bingo know can't openly discuss it? There's documented evidence supports someone infected result usage exhaust Also, N95 respirator valve approximates level simple cloth mask, CDC recommends cost effective measure preventing spread COVID 19.

There documented evidence supports someone infected result redhead named Susan, there's question redheaded Susans spread virus. Turns little data kinds highly specific infection scenarios. Many people infected idea infected (especially they've often careless and/or around have).  

The CDC recommending cloth masks (or equivalents) ideal solution. N95+ masks difficult come expensive, supplies adequate meet needs, even inferior options better nothing want people please put *something* front gaping virus spewing face holes. 

An N95 mask valve provides great protection person wearing less protection everyone around them. additional covering put valves helps degree, degree non-valved N95 mask would.  

Frankly, I'm CDC point. get people wearing *any* kind mask regularly properly going make positive difference. I'm really hating valved masks. Already happening think implies danger exaggerated (as part liberal conspiracy). kills people die anyway. makes easy liberals falsely claim death COVID actually died something else. seasonal flu, also disproportionately affects similar population. punishing everybody higher risk isolated everybody else go work, church, parties, sports, school.

A lot nonsense, course. kernel truth disease kills indiscriminately obviously worse one mostly kills vulnerable populations. many, death child potential full, healthy life much tragic death grandparent years poor health. guess things could much worse, mean situation *good* right now. upset people ''died'' AIDS reality died infections/maladies? lungs. cilia great moving dead cells reason detritus infection lung hard clear. Antibiotics kill bacteria, weaponry body produced fight bacteria ‚Äî mucus, essentially, sputum, it‚Äôs called cough ‚Äî left clearance mechanisms take stuff out,‚Äù says Steven Simpson, acting director division pulmonary disease critical care medicine University Kansas. airways lined hairlike cilia consolidate microbes mucus help move toward literally takes lot energy keep going stuff lungs,‚Äù Simpson says. pikachu meme gonna come back kinds covid posts? Call tell dropped pill? crazy? It‚Äôs like investment, you‚Äôre gambling hopes getting rich. flimsy justification people like wheel fact you‚Äôre taking risk. anything goes wrong money-making scheme, well, that‚Äôs signed for. Arizona scary place? Phoenix? I‚Äôm Tucson, things seem getting better here. haven‚Äôt seen anyone wear mask public, close proximity people. live Phoenix agree, last months I‚Äôve never gone grocery store retail store people around masks. Seems like people actually adapted rule perspective! went bad depression middle school missed lot days. sit principle, mom, man didn‚Äôt know think school faculty. told couldn‚Äôt miss anymore school would report truant would go juvie put foster system. come school everyday sick, let teacher know get permission go nurse would decide sent home not. shit.

There time flu went school asked first period teacher could go nurse. got mad coming school sick said should‚Äôve stayed home. explained couldn‚Äôt miss school still pissed me.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* would want that? take genius know what's going ffs

Edit: Fuck China fuck anyone disagrees something proven slow spread disease? late Europe ""opened up"". Sweden still 50 people limit public gatherings. Working China disgraceful. neither, know would give shit considering policies. tell already know can‚Äôt Chinese people openly discuss Tiananmen Square Americans open terrible things they‚Äôve done past. agree statement, also deflecting comment  yet way drs government working together inflate numbers funding... I'm citizen two countries. me? Yeah, commenter explained better did. limit many pills could ordered month manufacturer stay arbitrary limit. go might require waivers extra audits DEA, neither regional corporate office wanted deal with, tell customers stock end every month. 

That's understanding anyway. Google friend. Many places.... Yes sir/ma‚Äôam. Saliva test ASU. eventually leads AIDS, point infection weakened immune system substantially variety infections/maladies kill much easily parents need state-sponsored daycare. Americans already despise education teachers, classifying latter essential workers killing en masse means nothing them. Yeah, I‚Äôm sure children school avoid /s cold package imported somewhere spread corona, hard imagine kid sniffles efficient spreader. say masks protect people fucking unscientific can't fact-checked. It‚Äôs tiny little thumbs harm here, unfortunately. really? i‚Äôm also tucson lol need snark. lot people lot optimistic fall semester ended warranted. guess false hope, fact I‚Äôm essentially losing 1-2 years life tough pill swallow. vent post, dude. 

The US could well much better position right type relatable leadership, digress. D***.  live New Jersey.. hit hard March. Things looking lot better glimmers hope. I‚Äôm sure herd immunity yet. I‚Äôm sorry hear that. I‚Äôm Tucson, took saliva test got results back around 36 hours.  think masks stopping spread virus rumor? Honestly real worry people attending rally, nobody going left pump gas. Sweden nationalized healthcare system unlike USA? one? Oh, fuck's sake. time petty nationalistic squabbling. Tiananmen nothing compared atrocities US government commits committed Yikes. sensitive lungs/mild athsma. 

Hope P100 respirator stash N95s! made sure do. Still guarantee something. Here's rundown number excess deaths country also US still wear PPE behave ways effectively protect others, regardless they're wearing mask not. curious, Europe banned us? I'm sorry. sucks. renting storage units bodies. need see. I'd fight firing all. Especially trying tried get unemployment payments. test results date time taken, date notified along results.

It took us 17 days get husband's results, mass one July prison works lost his. work anyway Sgt COs (that's building minimal security guys getting within 5 years earned outside job, none allowed go since March). everybody negative, done National Guard health dept email results call 10th day, cause we've got shitty backlog still! yeah, started calling everyday 8th day waiting, cause I'm ill 3 kids asthmatic nasty unknown upper respiratory viral infection bbn lasted Sept-Jan 5 us. the16 year old got influenza B 3 weeks Feb, went back school think 7 school days March 13th shut down.

But 17 days still work huge CO shortage DOC. positive, scared still issues virus before, want responsible anybody else getting sick, inmate. coworker, family. since I'm physically out, errands everyone's doctor appts.

But average turnaround 18 days flat say now. kids started school yesterday, 3k get test county insurance we'd use it, wanted drive one we'd go wait 8 hours line one 3 counties away.

The pediatrician told us gives us month in.person school we'll back home. online charter district advertising employment spots Facebook need 30 teachers....after district let 80 go summer physical schools. I'm saying let go many sick high risk, told person goodbye. see anything forced resign.

But least masks made mandatory August 1-Sept 30. that....who hell knows cause kids allowed wear regular flu season. never know hour.. like line Shawshank. Get busy living get busy d.... still doesnt change fact large percentage nursing home patients die within first 6 months anyway.

I get distinction, know matters conversation studies point closer 10% influenza cases. 

[Source important thing keep mind underreported influenza infections are. Millions cases don‚Äôt go doctor year epidemiologists best estimate it. importantly little hard data asymptomatic infections influenza well. Since started April tell it‚Äôs fucking Easter Bunny killing everyone. bet next explanation would believe. Yeah, sorry. Spelling. know getting downvoted. true, even ""normal"" times. special snowflakes pig parents whining like little kids ""didn't know."" University administrators jail parents pay restitution every student crotch trophy infects. work death, nothing bothers anymore. one brought Trump(who also never referenced article) alternative Xi. stating superior options provided. ultimately saying every country take lesson CCP, government currently forcibly holds millions Uyghurs concentration camps. country like that, even China One ENTs mentioned Meniers disease me. tested Celiac last year started ibs symtoms never before. came back negative. Even though endoscopy said negative, really get blood test. may celiac sensitive gluten. try cut gluten diet see feel better. pandemic really hard stress eating weakness. Thanks caring. well kind redditor. Every person glasses coming cold warm mask tell basically masks available general public fall category. Masks protect guy, dope. ""This supposed done now"" Um. it? guess virus molecule get memo. extremely small number students practiced lip readers idea teachers need spread virus students/faculty order accommodate disabilities asinine. Let's come back three weeks Memorial Day

Let's come back three weeks mass protests

Let's come back three weeks reopen bars outdoor drinking

Let's come back three weeks Fourth July

Let's come back three weeks massive block parties

Let's come back three weeks reopen museums counterpoint, also pericarditis years ago (at age 20).

(I say far know given scans, squeamish, absolutely interest details. doctor seem concerned.) reason she‚Äôs nurse doctor apparently. Forced pay rent property own...? lmfao, get landlord. scummy system, tried profit it, got burned state effort protect general populace leeches like you. Cheers bud. submission removed.

89 families enough come scientific conclusions. research needs done larger scale.


([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Posts like make wanna say ""told so"", truth nothing celebrate.

It's also found cause brain damage similar stroke victims, awful.

I seriously hope *every country* stop B's political injections home fact nasty disease needs eliminated kill destroy lives tens millions people. Almost entirely &amp; completely preventable. needs done, record...I piss class. make hate me? life filled neither hate misery, must be, react like that. actual fuck wrong country? (No offence) they're next generation politicians. Yes, exactly it, explained wrong angle. 
That particular store allowed order something like 6,000 percocet per month manufacturer else needed special permission DEA, resulting audits. which, paperwork audits, regional corporate office feel like dealing with. 
This resulted turning customers end month sold 1st. 

That understanding anyway. write scripts, fill them.

Edit : BTW, 6,000 number first came head, idea many pills store would go month. Could 600,000 6 million know. Amen. much LESS empathy human race since whole mess started March levels stupid keep racheting higher higher.  quote can't remember well. recall reading people get brain surgery could hear crackling whooshing would lay down.

Actually think it, might one Simone Giertz videos youtube brain tumor.  virus can, actually, stop (and too) living life. mean 2020 going even longer now? Original goalpost: White House must open walking tours.

Someone points White House open walking tours.

Moved goalpost: open tours, tours can't require masks social distancing, etc, etc.  It‚Äôs always population control. Wake folks! LMAO. sub scientific sub, since substantial proportion posts links sensationalized news articles. see you‚Äôre subtley implying.

No, I‚Äôm kind person. saying average person way scared average person needs People think landlords large evil corporations. granny moving basement rent upstairs afford pay mortgage husband died left medical debt. Men far affected virus die far often. People need type hope, helps lot us mentally. know end normalcy coming back, even waves, huge. year redditors gotten relish heroes civilization degenerate lifestyle already does, staying home socially isolating. coronavirus stops dont get self righteous hero nothing lose bashing people livelihoods scared future least Australia consistent shutting BLM lockdown protests.

Though seem excessive arrest someone home posting protest. leaders supporters protests arrested well? strawmanning, anything specific Pfeizer's vaccine work here? sounds like reaching anything try stitch together argument.

Wow. argument ""I trust private companies oversight."" give example abused trusting private company (even oversight) much flawed. ""Quit strawmanning!""

Yeah, we're done buddy. take whatever shit Trump pushes without testing proper oversight, I'll wait see happens. Would've sworn it'd Texas Mississippi Florida. commenter say cloth. said clothes. underwear pants shirt. Gotta go work nude. Uh huh. Sounds like reported funded person wanting get people back fucking office. working day night commuting. wayyyyyy better. Yes, go frontline essential workers first. ""If vaccine found effective, leg doses, saved lot time without safety risks,"" Fauci said. ""If safe effective wasted lot money. that's federal government's investment make things go quickly. end year limited point, said, next step prioritize gets access first doses, likely candidates elders compromised immune systems. process prioritization done independently clinical trials, said, adding likely doses anyone wants sometime first months 2021.


So say get approval November, there's still gonna months.  I'm really optimistic mid-spring next year. also need keep mind Oxford's first, may bit additional lag well. Sorry quoting sources right summary COVID respiratory deaths shows excess deaths summary total Causes. Total Deaths top lists 110% Expected, includes ""today"" CDC acknowledges numbers incomplete go back 4-ish weeks. Calculating without incomplete data gives 115% number. page Dashboard updated Number Excess Deaths shows current ""over average"" value 253,841 deaths. Again, incomplete numbers ""today"" 270k 115% deaths value ""today"" likely counting complete. Quote actual 253k+ comfortable extrapolation. bailouts meant keep employees fall. fall coming travel hasn‚Äôt rebounded companies forced adjust. Missing smash mouth right course I'd think problem anti-mask protesters they're going careful anywhere are, they're already risk prone, locale gather might suffer result malicious negligence. Repeating assertion doesn‚Äôt make true, Derpie. Everyone knocking vaccines largely reported March vaccine might ready September. looking later don‚Äôt see people‚Äôs issue know bruh So... weirdos claim ""they want keep us locked reason"" apparently someone takes position? think right brand/model respirator it? I've looked lot respirators never seen one filter exhaust valve. concept Trump saying wear mask wearing one. Christie shutting beach sitting it. say work leading example, CDC stopped encouraging us limit travel, travel, staying away people negative test result. Kenney breaking rules exactly following either.

The ridiculous part Philadelphia opening restaurants week, surely mayor could waited week go visit friend's restaurant. even believe indoor dining city, fine time eating outside, restaurant industry brutalized (esp to-go alcohol sales prohibited May). say bad optics understating it. fair, even Fauci unveils ""a safe highly effective"" vaccine ready go December, U.S. gov't still mass produce hundred million doses effective vaccines (vials) entire population. there's question gets inoculated first. whole timeline could take many months tbh. I'm still saving retirement, much I'm afford keeps dawning screwed are,we gonna able retire, probably majority us able touch SS, that's even thing soon. 

What bleak future strawmanning, anything specific Pfeizer's vaccine work here? sounds like reaching anything try stitch together argument.

While bringing anything up, Pfizer largest mass producer penicillin allies WWII, tune hundreds billions units. company improve methods ramped production fastest. yes, back fast track stuff too. post World Warcraft sub. Typical jobless leftist loser living mommy's basement playing video games day whining capitalism sucks. Apparently, CDC [recommending using masks meant healthcare workers, like N95 sure fear running supplies exactly. interact though, understand provided one rule can't even wear ones bring in. talking definition, merit culture. agree idiotic try shame people following reasonable rules. Hopefully there‚Äôll slipups here.

There always slipups. question is, deal quickly? Exactly. think best case scenario early spring 2021 widely available vaccine. Probably diabetes count /s It‚Äôs it‚Äôs. sub nutshell. healthcare system ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get sick‚Äù 

Which pretty shitty health care system. mean Black Death basically burned without vaccine. took 100 million deaths though.  need /s show sarcasm? Nailed it, haha It‚Äôs impossible get pharmacist position VA every pharmacist wants work there. fear? can‚Äôt recognize may long term effects need extra careful? Ha. feel this. kids, too, definitely challenge find right balance feel like you‚Äôre quality work decent job parent. easy get lost one job other, whole prefer handle PJs, too. Thanks letting know this! plugged numbers apparently 9 million chance (low risk). recall. symptomatic people exposed getting tested right now. far kids ill effects, here's paper: thinking kids carry higher coronavirus loads adults, even asymptomatic. put together kids childish touching everything, washing hands, following rules like wearing masks, etc., kids much dangerous infected adults. worry kids, worry households well. school resigned families sign waivers, end says document ""leagally"" binding. count can't spell? Nah it'll continue free üòâ Linsey Marr, aerosol specialist Virginia Tech, posted Twitter study showing neck gaiters probably fine, especially they're doubled over. 

I agree current state science journalism frustrating, certainly seems true initial report insufficiency neck gaiters done crummy techniques. So, we're going way back moderate neo-liberal Democrat '90s blame ""bOtH sIdEs!"" shitty handling situation been? Turns really daft! think people afraid falsified data FDA rubber stamping since already shown sway Trumps demands indeed listen health experts.

You‚Äôve got me.

I‚Äôm one dumbshit scientists reads primary literature accepts expert consensus.

I also always wear mask indoors around non quaranteam.

I talking uptgread, realized you‚Äôre also ‚Äúskeptic‚Äù thought talking you. agree. someone lives healthcare realm, amazed 6 months in. can't get testing supplies house tests anymore, etc. Can't wait winter flu season. Many people saying Air Transport Association

I reddit much see IATA think means ""I Asshole"". outpatient surgery two weeks ago. wearing cloth mask, took temperature gave disposable paper-ish (not N95) mask wear instead. 48 hours COVID test came back negative.

The front desk ladies wearing cloth masks (when I'm saying cloth mask mean reusable/washable kind designs etc) nurses surgeon wearing paper-ish style made switch to. aren‚Äôt serious. Medicare cover 90 days hospice, reviewed every 90 days see still needed (ie. expected die soon). believe they'll cover short-term rehab ( like less month?) otherwise Medicare cover nursing homes. MEDICAID, however, cover nursing homes in-home waiver services met income requirements (ie. Spent assets poor) provided find bed you. always case. next sentence quoted one says probably worried spreading make indication concerned spreading (from heard interview, could wrong though!)

Even Reagan meme actually really suited GCJ, hell /r/science might negative. Darwinism work. Truly absurd! wife's smart woman would 100% agree. think correct. Sweden thought could achive thing countries without forcing punishing people. Sweden sort lockdown. used carrots instead sticks.

For example april highest number people ever (twice high 2019) staying home getting paid take care sick children. children sicker, guidelines says stay home slightest symtoms. Similarly government made get paid stay home youre sick before. Riskgroups gets paid stay home etc. imagine majority hoaxers underlying conditions, makes desperate cries ""Only 6% COVID-attributed deaths actually caused COVID, rest underlying conditions!!!11!"" ironic. want see Bill Gates go first! joke plan better current plan. government invest vaccine manufacturing either directly indirectly contract, could least let people pay investment.

It's like house fire we've chosen super saver shipping fire whole concept paying piles cash 

With tragedies due Covid, focus disgust? Same. figured would experience could work couple months art/passion projects time off. Instead mental health cratered. Merica‚Äô Somewhat encouraging. Got it. Herd immunity worked well bubonic plague. killed half Europe. ü§¶ Wtf every day there's new article new stupid thing like this. dumb. Let people safe. Distance learning way go. need mask Testing 1/3rd people 2 weeks ago. Ron DeathSentence Hunchgut lies deception. already reality. link sources. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Yeah major shows supposed go year. bands I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get see Half attributed lack leadership Correct I'm wrong, get 1918 pandemic via herd immunity, right? 700-800k Americans died; 70 million died worldwide. big deal time because, somehow, nobody seemed talk make big deal it. Woodrow Wilson never mentioned pandemic even once.

Herd immunity would probably end pandemic too. death toll would much people now. think 5-6 million Americans would die tried get via natural herd immunity. mortality rate consideration. Hospital rates much higher mortality, basically many people get quite sick (enough require hospital admission) die. good! primary original objective overrun hospital systems. hospitals capacity, start turning people away, many non-COVID illnesses left *somehow* fit mess. remember this? Omg same! DUMPED HUGE workload us. take advantage work home, boss call work hours something needs get done (I get overtime since I'm salary). Thing is, there's jobs there. know it. I'd like quit can't jobs. simplest explanation probably testing much prevalent looking cases VS deaths.

Another thing deaths lag cases month, start wave see spike deaths well it. It‚Äôs disturbing many people don‚Äôt care someone know dies. virus made incredibly pessimistic way treat other. shouldn‚Äôt know someone personally want save others lives. Science constantly evolving course opinion change new information emerges. kids know maintain literally proper protocols safety puts teachers remit healthcare workers

I still think glossing lot details.

Healthcare workers risk simply presence virus often. exposed ways general public not, like present procedures cause fine mists produced. 

Sure, kids wear masks adamantly, touch noses probably cough shit way adults would. things N95 magically protects against. teachers still primarily exposed virus, N95 not, touching face contaminated hands, something filter well-fitting mask mitigate.

So given there's least plausible reason wanting prevent shortages medically-necessary mask, think outrage around misplaced. fully support people choose ignore wear anyways, long result mass hysteria fear mongering.

I think easy people say ""what?! espousing *utmost* protection us?!"" get away lack thinking involved mindset. There's risk calculation made, mean necessarily dangerous negligent taken seriously. Overall, speculation best. However, true increased number military advisors South Vietnam vowed let fall Communism. Additionally, Kennedy revealed point presidency disagreed doctrine CIA military time. administration conceive Bay Pigs, let occur. Plus, administration increased military spending. Would Vietnam War occurred way Kennedy lived? know. believe Kennedy become mythological figure United States. Many believe assassinated would changed United States. get Civil Rights legislation New Frontier bills *but muh rights!* school district want lawsuits? get lawsuits. Or... maybe Lord &amp; Taylor Men's Warehouse. think cases employers provide adequate safeguards, enforced policies lead towards clusters employees getting sick.

This could work ""adequate safeguards"" known time, eg. city/state/country set policies employers follow. However, different story later turns done could avoided spreading virus, nobody really knew time outbreak. 

Then another question companies designated essential services. Working would put employees higher risk catching virus home, whole idea essential services required society function, (the society) collectively accepted higher risk people working jobs price functioning society. cases even connect outbreaks workplaces, think bit unfair crush employers us benefited essential services open. 

Finally issue availability protective gear. instance masks could purchased time reserved hospitals, culpable employer providing essential services masks workers? Lmao fuck CDC recently updated mask recommendation exclude n95 masks, one way valve stop spread virus.

""Masks exhalation valves vents worn help prevent person wearing mask spreading COVID-19 others (source control)."" I'll save comment take look back year two see came be. I'll wager home sales overall continue climb. Plenty willing able buyers. Plenty people moved city hit happy hour close friends partying. people aging realizing get older rationale changes. life goals change. subjective comment, I'll continue wager seeing outfall expedited COVID, rather COVID *cause* movement. 

Small businesses fail sure, replaced new small businesses. Everyone mindset business established, fails net bad thing. case all. Society seen paradigm shift need accept maybe gas station every corner intelligent decision one could make.

Miles Taylor warning us crazy stuff like even common future.

Taylor worked Trump campaign used work DHS. said 2 types people work now, arsonists firefighters (those feed President's impulses reign in). 4 years firefighters pushed ones gasoline running show. issue lot N95 masks vents much stop spreading virus? US half-assed lockdown reopened still 20,000 new cases per day (6 per 100,000)

UK dragged feet locking down, initially wanted follow herd immunity protocol. shut due backlash rapidly increases cases.

While, course, ignoring every left wing event. actually spelled Hydroxychloroquine   /s They're basically guaranteeing strike lawsuits based safety issues. need mask states that! Maybe picture! Pre-fascism grows chaos.

But chaos opposite fascism. One lack order, one overly oppressive order. I'm teacher I've told mask, hand sanitizer allowed post ""high-quality information?"" anything false? last major social group thing 30th, March 14

I‚Äôve thinking looks like covid gonna cleanly strip away 30th year, I‚Äôll bet bday party 31st ""stop trying it"" part. lot kids great online/home schooling circumstances. sudden, caused problems. Mostly ones think ""well I'm physically school matter"". 

My nephew like this. He's teen, instead homework plays video games grandma watch enforce rules. lot peers treat like huge vacation. know others (myself included) who've adjusted well even thrived switching online.

Completely depends kid, guardians, school. mean quit trying. Oh shit wonder 30s look like leave anyone via legal will. designate someone. It‚Äôs things like designated, courts decide.  be? already fucking evidence. Bruh! Even exposed elective surgery patient (who screened tested positive two days discharge), told didn‚Äôt symptoms could still work regardless positive not. wonder breakout. Luckily negative though  here. pretty frustrating.

It‚Äôs supply issue. want saved medical staff Yeah US don‚Äôt see employees or, hell, even customers wearing masks leave. Fuck that.  Testing staff discouraged known exposures even. pressure avoid testing costs among staff.

Also patients completely non compliant. I've literally already accepted I've either covid will, survival dice roll. There's point fighting anymore maybe we'd rather succumb draconian measures like cover face public shady science may asymptomatically spread virus someone that's statistically real danger anyone 70, quicker allow virus burn healthy population sooner get back normal. teachers still primarily exposed virus, N95 not, touching face contaminated hands, something filter well-fitting mask mitigate.

Citation needed. 

Whole classes get this. Florida 9,000 infections, admitted to, kids first week. 

And central air heating, certainly do, find statement believable. We've already seen studies show that, mask all, takes five minutes everyone church exposed. teachers going closed spaces eight hours could well contaminated air. simply cannot say N95 preferable situation. 

Besides which, adjust N95 nearly much and, know you, wear one glasses fog up. also, simply, comfortable, meaning less desire touch it. reasons alone make best option. 

Also, know, scientists agree me, nevermind that, guess. Since comment removed political restating include facts Trump administration specific instead leave bits Fauci:

Their point Fauci Trump appointee, director NIAID since 1984, also part Regan administration, Bush administrations, Clinton administration, Obama administration. I‚Äôm nurse towards beginning employer banned us using masks weren‚Äôt covid unit emergency department. Agreed.

That said, anticipating first music festival this, I'm praying good god get knocked first mosh pit see. NY's death rate comparing states? sarcastic, course.

Actively pursuing herd immunity could kill millions people sheer lunacy.

Doing herd immunity may even possible virus even nuts. Thank you!  basically forced work sick. Providers often choice... Even pandemic agree probably thinks masks dumb/unnecessary. I'm defending sentiment, I'm defending fact think masks dumb still self-aware enough realize others cost wearing one basically nothing anyways. think important, acknowledged others acts accordingly. grow culture place emotional significance pain focus attention it, brain actually learns feel pain without much associated negative feelings. Perception pain part sensory lot interpretation brain. learned response. culture grew in, pain something people either talk much about, expectation adapt pain, dwell it, move on. Consequently, actually \*feel\* pain like people do. I'm ignoring it, literally feel badness it. involved sports result injuries times, I've done something injurious, actually stop really think I'm hurt pain much indicator me, brain ignores it. younger person, aware learned insensitivity pain, would things like break foot continue walk run it. Even weeks ago, fell rocks hiking, partner looked really concerned pretty weird fall. got up, felt fine, continued hiking hours. realize sprained ankle till next day. Emotions endorphins funny thing. old farmer/laborer types similar learned responses pain, can't really assume affecting mentally even though physical signs. Mean already 1000s case's schools opened yes let's fuck else better damn laughing stock world shit I'm still angry this. 

NBA Bubble example- everyone tessted multiple times week, quarantined nice hotel room, clorox wipes small country. Meanwhile sister, State employee, forced quarantine pay 2 weeks might exposed. went gov. ordered test center said ""we advanced test gets results 24 hours use government employees exposed. regular tesst takes 3-5 days everyone else."" 

Guess test gave her? thought went mild lockdown (one voluntary?) thinking Switzerland. Sorry dumb use ones valves. wear second mask prevent spreading droplets. Inner mask me, outer mask y'all. expect someone preaching people's ignorance lack empathy wearing mask open exhaust port much self awareness. I'll admit, attempt critique comprehension need spoonfed critiqued first place delicious irony. Yeah main bulk deaths summer though. think control now. example:

Walking cliches. Colleges universities chose open campuses pandemic need incur costs. that's study looking at.

In places wearing mask said saving lives compatriots widespread virus is, refusing going antisocial behavior. However, 10 cases diagnosed day country - deaths, *cases* - obviously wearing mask particularly much help save countrymen, making failure neutral event.

Same thing Sweden: Swedes told country strategy take particular caution spread COVID-19. Thus, antisocial fail wear mask. going anyone's interests so, least authority figures country.  Well, fair, that's money teachers spending school supplies. /s might face-value. Pardon pun...

On face it; makes sense-- sociopath-has empathy- sociopath wear face mask. (also wear mask face--lol!)

But least U.S. political president making political; freedom choose wear one, personal rights or.... science science-y. BS.

Yes wear mask. period. 

when people make us ask (researchers included) wearing mask.... wrong you? sides lazy me. ways democrats subpeona hold people contempt court PRISON.

Do they? Nope. assume scared it'll come back happen whenever pendulum swings way.

Vote ones interested using law instead pointing fingers.

:shrug:

EDIT: Hell could impeach again. point Dems keep hounding choose stay quiet. rather sick point. Sweden turned ""really badly"". Countries like Peru Spain worse (with intense lockdowns). able discern Sweden graph far death per million (they're 8th something). point Sweden go apocalypse proclaimed decided impose lockdowns, that's better policy, they're probably done covid too. November... else scheduled November? rings bell... Umm. No. That's towing line. shit making sound like he's something. He's not. There's nothing innovative. He's basically saying I'll protect messed system Republicans.  state's cases dropping without vaccine reinfect themselves...and low infection rate far lower death rate Sweden. medical extremist? personal medical decision.

Are medical moron? reap benefits living society, also expected part safety.  I've also heard Sweden many people live alone, many less multi-generational households - less kids going school killing grandpa. Plus population willing socially distance without beaten them.

So went poorly there, imagine strategy could far worse here. Thanks :) see nice thank inbox 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! feels like government wants herd immunity don‚Äôt say it. main conclusions mostly unaffected, correction states. look kn95s, plenty around b/c countries actually took things seriously reason told people wear masks want everyone going buying every type mask could get hands leave nothing medical workers. look happened even something like toilet paper, ended well. Fauci came explained reasoning later. What's Finnish joke? I'm looking forward end social distancing stop standing close together... non-result. correction pleased confirm **reanalysis data led change main conclusions study.** originally reported, **compared healthy controls risk factor‚Äìmatched controls, patients recently recovered COVID-19 lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricle volume, elevated values T1 T2.** However, corrected findings longer show higher left ventricular mass patients. confirm errors.""

So still great. Time defund Department Human Shit Thoughts prayers‚Ñ¢ petty, dangerous irresponsible. forget 17 Anesthesiologists tested positive partying University Florida Shands Hospital! staff interviewed right that, said well known large numbers staff already infected. Two days later ... silence. Many surgery days doctors' party wondering got infected anesthesiologist. Republican agenda making government agencies incompetent, inefficient untrustworthy continues successfully.

And much hate Trump Republicans, almost hard get super mad it, cuz know they're gonna act. like getting mad dog grabbing pork chop left table right front leaving room. No, American people really blame this. know they're dont everything stop winning elections. hold Democrats 50x higher standards shit dont always live them.

We deserve start getting voting booths something it. year, faith US, least CDC, least FDA. 

Now I‚Äôm Dr. Fauci trustworthy source. doubt they've started decline. started day trump admin ordered covid numbers sent directly WH. Right logic even people indoors may catch virus, seroprevalence amongst general population, addition people able infected, much less likely spread. addition people immune. probably [this they're disallowing, help breathing virus since port let air out, defeating half purpose wearing one.

I highly doubt care masks non vented ones, they'll required parties. i'm 100% convinced, qualified everything things like ""likely,"" ""little nothing,"" ""appears"" specifically 100% convinced. bizarre ignore characterize said way.

and i'm using mom's statement, facts articles describing sequence events, kicked massive stroke caused insurmountable brain doctors tried everything, Galindo said, damage daughter‚Äôs brain irreversible. Astrid connected machine Sunday Wednesday, mother gave approval disconnect it. 

and also stats article elsewhere render even less likely someone age ""coronavirus victim."" 

none even new information wtf say i'm cherry picking evidence?! wtf even talking about, negative test positive test, that's we're talking false positive false negative. even read articles?!??!? i'm cherry picking without evidence?!?!??!?!? even responding to?!?!?!?!? I've calling herd stupidity. opposite herd immunity.

Herd stupidity existence stupid, anti-intellectual, anti-science people ACTUALLY get people sick.

I'd like see companies want employees die collect profits. fine, think people buy bunch KN95 masks thinking they're guaranteed get N95 protection, panic faced idea KN95 quality actually board.

For anyone reading, Korea much better ramping production masks maintaining quality. better buying KF94s KN95s. However, China got wind factories quickly started producing knockoff KF94s, make sure getting reputable seller. Make put writing next time get lawyer review communications. amazed amount eugenics talk seeing around this. think crux saying, agree with, distancing, lockdowns, masks, et al sort impact allow burnout reached lower range, i.e. 10-20% range we're seeing consistently. going example, though, interventions appear making smaller difference compared profound impact reaching burnout.

This Im saying. Behavior changes interventions change level burnout. likely reason seems 20% ongoing behavioral changes restrictions. Go back normal threshold goes up. think fact going see final infection rates higher southern states Northeast Nov 1 would seem indicate control land continued reductions mobility/restrictions indicate yet found ceiling indicated YYG re: social argued consistent, extremely low levels spread harm NY necessarily mean burnout, primarily, that's helping NY, since heterogeneity model anticipates low levels followed explosive growth. know that's necessarily right reading heterogeneity models (Gu's model, instance, really predict explosive growth anywhere show historical trends) interpret saying mean NY, enough controls eventually relaxed, believe explosive growth ala March/April would return?

His model SEIR ML layer tuning parameters, based explanation. That's proposed heterogenous model paper everyone using justify 20% HIT. dont think YYG's model specifically accounts heterogeneous transmission. Yes, told everyone go back normal, smaller number infections aggregate since there's proportion immunity already. know you‚Äôre joking looks like anabolic steroids could actually viable Smooth sailing good point absent first wave places. we're talking effect - indoors since March, although live city people going out, _virtually_ another location - indoors. virus entered ""indoors"" location. Hence ""second waves"" ""re-openings"".

The people indoors fodder ""second wave"" following waves.  You‚Äôre part r/Christianity, don‚Äôt talk mental illness don‚Äôt fucking get reality. reason could possibly this??? could protection forbidden. Let alone time like this?! Scientists only.

Those choices. Fauci lied masks wash? right. didn‚Äôt check.

Oh way ever find quantitative comparisons prove places didn‚Äôt ‚Äúshut down‚Äù? would still like play ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt burden proof things say reasons‚Äù card? quit. Wear make fire you. Guessing reserve medical staff? people wonder I'm right-to-die advocate. little desire live past 50 Note hydrocortisone (as mentioned article) steroid, NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory).

Specifically steroids: known increase risk infections, fear gave someone covid would get secondary infections much worse off. 

In practice turns increase risk secondary infections, benefits outweigh risks.

This different thing ""rumours"" good quality clinical trials needed possible treatment. cases finally started decline, colleges opening across America going make rocket right back Yeah. I'm gonna stick P100 well. Especially since (with 3D printer) make cartridges filled HEPA filter medium work well store-bought cartridges impossible find. really. mental health issues I'm concerned fellow man. propagating hate sitting behind screen reality would never say things person face face coward. really want get help seek counseling damaging coronavirus. Please get head checked... sake everyone around well. well, friend. Ever heard term Golden Handcuffs? country paycheck paycheck. can't quit like that. least us privileged. Fauci COMMENT THREATEN ENCOURAGE VIOLENCE WTF? Rapid tests lower sensitivity dramatically improve situation.

The problem two-fold.

First, tests take two weeks (!!!) get result. means effectively useless driving policy making public health decisions.

Second, high-sensitivity PCR tests distinguish active, infectious individuals people infectious even ill. makes difficult produce effective public health policy.

These rapid tests means react quicker, test often, better track infection spreading. improve contact tracing exponentially. phone number call order. hand limited number exceptions. 2020 though, believe mobile, desktop, phones, can't made work vast majority people. trump admin put responsibility state local government themselves. federal issue single national strategy, hodgepodge 50 state strategy. virus knows state lines. things cause disability later life? virus won‚Äôt eradicated. That‚Äôs beauty fear mongers. Every year there‚Äôs gonna cases, soon open park, it‚Äôs ‚Äúbring body bags!‚Äù Considering Trump running show he's encouraging violence dislikes, actually hates non rich republican base too, think deliberate. Wear fabric mask medical mask. family China report things basically back normal, though masks still required regions. know actually Covid free, general attitude clusters break again, test everyone whole city risky engage activities. want us get sick specifically, want give appearance normalcy election. like go movies exercise gym...but guess can't global pandemic?  fly Sweden country Europe exceptionally easy 2019-flu season.

This argument seems violate basic principles scientific causality.

If sample S, something happened happen samples N, F D.

The reason something happened 4 samples. 

More visual: put 4 samples fridge. 1 get ruined, 3 fine.

I say ""The fridge working right ruined sample!"" fridge ruin 3 samples.

Instead, I'd exlude possible causes things happened 4 samples, look stuff happened ruined sample 3 samples.

Just that, I'd disregard - assumption 2019 mild flu year Nordic countries? countries normal flu Sweden mild flu year? Then, make sure take advised precautions. good news, known weeks, countries / places mask mandates, lot asymptomatic infections places mask mandates. Also, detected early, COVID infections handled simple medications. Make sure take Vitamin supplements buy good oximeter check oxygen level daily. Check medical papers insurance papers. Plan prepare. wear masks. healthcare, probably access better information provide, obviously need PPE.

Good luck! Ughh im sorry!! Hope arent pool noodle anymore ü•¥ What's history attempting achieve herd immunity without benefit vaccine? anyone think single successful case done? 

Is even benefit giving credence idea herd immunity via infection? still disagree idea arrested protesting policy. mean everyone‚Äôs wearing masks social distancing dangerous event could be? seems like overstepping Anything rather November 3rd would solve US testing problems.  known companies want employees die like OP suggested. Insurance companies business lose money. suspect foul play fight tooth nails pay out. relax, plenty imbeciles like here, attempt steal election, nothing else makes sense. Incompetence cannot explain away. FDA given mask makers ability self certify meaningless point.

Buy reputable source look astm rating (ex I'll check. 9,000 seems incredibly low consider state New York close 20 million people. Plus, there's hundreds millions Americans US.

Plus, say covid safe/not big deal supposedly directly killed 9,000 people. live vacuum, neither covid-19. Millions Americans pre-existing conditions comorbidities, combined covid, fatal. There's also lot know, there's excuse taking virus seriously.

Edit: here's read, see bunch misinformation went viral. important think critically though see numbers make sense. Nah, steal dumb plebeians first.

He's business professor made dumb comment something related field.

Honestly, what's downside this?

We've already produced vaccines, there's little marginal cost distributing administering them.

If find vaccines gave safe, 20% effective, what's downside? saved tens thousands lives? Trump fan, funny. lots shrek/reddit overlay read sonewhere earliest infected nothing market

Yep, correct. wet market origin theory debunked way back really surprise though? ? pipes loud enough guess.

Yeh NO. dont make safe vaccines rush. Sweden's daily cases without vaccine reinfect (what ridiculous notion). stop vaccinations

Are medical extremist? personal medical decision. skip, think way through. Military actually seems make sense since good number living communities may ideal place assure best possible effectiveness.

I think you‚Äôre right one-offs. It‚Äôs impossible tell virus originated cases.  scenarios employers simply negligent, valid cases there.

Pretty much gist linked article way, we‚Äôre echoing points. This. People doom gloom. follow several scientists working Covid-19 hopeful vaccine end year/beginning next year.

Fauci420 Take American Geriatrics Society realize people nursing homes long term care facilities different life expectancy healthy individuals right? looking life expectancy numbers people aged 85+. looking life expectancy numbers people nursing homes LTC facilities.

This UCSF study discusses average stay numbers nursing homes. ""**Fifty-three percent nursing home residents study died within six article shows 41% covid deaths nursing homes long term care facility assertion ""people die auto accidents daily higher rates."" nonsense made up? think measure rate death actually exists? You, anyone else saying that‚Äôs something works (without providing evidence support conclusion) make so. sure hard concept grasp starve happened born That's even reasonable would assume 0 people died covid anyways.

no shit? risk 40 year old woman dying roughly run car walking street.

Young adults aren‚Äôt much better. Getting abstain risky behavior pretty much impossible we‚Äôve seen colleges reopened. aren‚Äôt vaccinated spreading like crazy. Huh, worse guys?

(So 53% six months)

9 die 8 months

8 die 12 months

8 die 16 monthS

8 die 20 months

9 die 24 months

8 die 28 months

What‚Äôs average life expectancy? Well, experts refused listen pandemic team decided disband. tools necessary right thing chose instead pretend like wasnt problem. 

So want run analogy - China broke engine, instead taking car mechanic road said car running fine nothing worry even smoke started billow hood. know steps fix issue actively refuse them, still blame even cause.

Like imagine someone spilled wine carpet someone like ""oh, steps need take get stain out!"" instead go ""nah, that's fault! stain go April!"" Like come on. Obviously person made spill ultimately fault nothing remedy situation options cant shed responsibility.

Obviously Covid 19 nuanced issue dont get absolve someone blame, especially person literally access nearly limitless supply resources experts. mention Trump? Oh no. ever survive, living one house that‚Äôs large enough two? people country profoundly stupid poor reasoning critical thinking skills.


I dont say Im super smart anyone astonishing whats going on. Herman Cain Republican voters need understand seriousness pandemic, somehow, still enough. guess shrug blame 2020? 150,000 Americans would still alive Obama served third term. admit there. say don‚Äôt *any* measures? could required contaminated test first month pandemic, could tested sewage treatment plants identify clusters used testing shut smartly, could protected nursing homes instead shipping infected patients back in, could used rapid automated testing mechanisms developed South Korea instead following ‚ÄúNot Invented Here‚Äù FDA CDC, states counties could hired required contact tracers- could done lot serious minimizing illness wouldn‚Äôt required ineffective shutdowns adopted. result incompetence public health infrastructure government local, state federal levels. Negotiations work debtor money pay, right?

Canada‚Äôs healthcare system stupid! /s alma mater honestly I‚Äôve wondering long would take make headlines.  Oh can‚Äôt bring sensible debate forum, sorry did. Thanks nice convo. 

How‚Äôs COVID situation there? country friend say it‚Äôs so, doesn‚Äôt make so. one previous points, PCP/ER MD/DO says doesn‚Äôt make so. whats likely happen flu season coronavirus flu attack body even harder merge im scared countries especially UK opening like nothing happening okay people taking masks majority wearing correctly even shops hell allot people dont mask going get worse flu season ?

fixt lock April biggest difference IMO. made numbers infections crash down. visible curve infected worldofteters.

It lifted gradually carefully starting months nearly done 3 months later. Kindergartens young school pupils first ""unlocked"", small shops, restaurants, bars, fitness centers.

I forgot exact order reopening tbh confusing remember hairdressers malls libraries reopened :) 

The next biggest thing amped testing months Sweden did. govt. cooperating big bio tech companies.

On top that, many, many ""small"" measures make stay - like really lot. need place lockdown beat down, otherwise goes back lockdown nothing.

Like trains sell every second seat, kindergarten kids stay outside day, go municipality, waiting line outside inside. cafes removed tables, on. 

Everyplace go, there's small things. spontaneous. 

I guess even Sweden last category, even though know. know Sweden, guess also would done things like that. They're usually sensible, leadership dropped ball corona.

So big differences 1 month lockdown gradually eased plus better testing. worked several hospitals large cities. get unit avoid Covid contact, would problem taking lunch outside sitting wall, sidewalk to. nurse, need resourceful, flexible, avoid infection. common sense. forever. Nurses conversations later, masks on. Video talks likelihood children getting covid-19 Oh, do. I‚Äôm taking money leaving soon borders open.  I‚Äôm going fund stupidity anymore. perspective, vaccine kills less people virus gives rest immunity would safe enough push. death rate virus 3% (not sure actual rate right now) vaccine ""only"" kills 2% economically advantageous push it. take it. Really seem like comes chance lot ways. I‚Äôm Atlanta, known 30+ people caught it, sort connection 9 people that‚Äôve died. always taken seriously, people knew started dying still pretty shocking. countries like Ireland population 2,000? day?

Depending CDC right way go normal circumstances. relaxed restriction already February, sounds responsibly early me. one really alarmed yet ‚Äì states started closing schools 2 weeks March. won‚Äôt convince Hillary would‚Äôve done differently.  died essentially cause say died coronavirus? Many people test positive symptoms. logically follow since died since tested positive corona died corona. They're misreading data. see 6% dying Covid ergo, real amount deaths, 84% actually dying something else. They're confusing cause death co-morbidity. think realizing they're making rather elementary mistake. quite like though. ACE receptors heart receptor COVID19 exploits infect cells. influenza may cause heart issues COVID much specific. study published day two ago discussed /r/covid19 (science moderated sub) showed damaging heart. think mean cars comrade. Among issues, means relaxed standards PPE probably good enough. Health care workers need better protection job! told 6 feet, size human. Easy follow visualize. correct. Idiots think Bill Gates created tracking device would come vaccine, something like that. Yep that‚Äôs keeps hopeful. see despise 'boring' version reality... instead choose live fantasy world created circle-jerkers.

But, truth death rate plummeting. makes blood boil. want RAGE like mighty Chihuahua are. 

I end life simply avoiding paying taxes. (Cause Momma) Overall testing declined Florida. still clear decline. Mask use Florida even mandated many businesses. see correlation overall mask usage around 2-3 week delay early August/late July. sure factors think biggest one time. went seeing maybe 25% people wearing masks 80%+ major stores. curious see affect schools open well (again looking 2-3 week delay week many schools opened). data follows pretty clearly events (like phase 2 reopening subsequent surge) shall see. Texas doesn‚Äôt like this. touch southern roots without morons like southern states. teenager, they‚Äôre already parties n sharing vapes bathroom, everyone tired cooped acting usual absolutely ridiculous parents. Kid tested went school. told time testing isolate 14 days/until get results. 

Honestly, breaking testing isolation result fines. Well, anything, Oxford one *isn't* rushed. reusable vaccine platform development tested humans since 2012. Give freedom give death - death then. 12 days 2 days ahead schedule.

4.4m population 50k tests average means 691000 students would take 14 days test.

without testing group. (pulling population numbers Alberta province) Well know still get virus, lesser version it. Additionally, masks effective protecting others. Sorry new strategy avoid asymptomatic testing numbers appear go election. Deception method. Goodbye think likely get covid 3 times hit asteroid Evan Dimov, owner Much Sauce, said restaurant gains business phase reopening.

""We need people come fast,"" explained. ""The day announced 50% capacity, saw huge increase business. People feel confident, comfortable go out.""

Well everyone Florida kind condition, buckle up. hiding bed? hiding bed lack understanding ? Apparently! knew? kind kicks ball road end year - can't imagine would - solve crisis housing long term, short term, stave many evictions, *if* enough people resources follow instructions *and* defend court landlords still pursue eviction.

Good info here: Renters still owe accrued rent face penalties failing pay.

Most people facing eviction going ability pay 4 months expires especially penalties piling top accrued rent. kicks problem road election. perfume along!!! I'm sure understand mean. Please elaborate. Also note, think US FDA necessarily approves drugs foreign trial results, they'll want test regardless. respirator type facemask able filter 95% particles, require fit test. ""general use"" respirators exist, (ex: Pastuer F550Gs) they're kinda rare now.

A reusable respirator cartridge side. concern exhaled air filtered, solution cover port (a simple bandanna works). 

There reason ban respirators general. still get 50 pack headband KN95s ebay 150 bucks each, 3 reuses (70C oven 30 min) bag would last school year. kicking election Apparently noone matters, except black lives. According media is. hear about. sayin. sure Trump w that.  Remember back February/March western governments telling citizens masks useless actually increase probability getting sick average redditor would call stupid wearing one...

how times changed (i've wearing mask since February) course relevant. activities could potentially spread covid equally result suspensions. grossly unfair behavior result different punishment. replace BLM church services want, result same. 

The point suspensions discourage students engaging activities spread covid. matter whether activity Trump rally, BLM protest, world peace. Covid care, it? sub full Debbie Downers predicting gloom doom spreading panic.


I mean entire sub dedicated pandemic mostly bad news. shit year many levels. hard optimistic. defending mentality, get people there. else government cull population re-establish functional economy? none willing die Americas economy ask this, really love country? kind idiot kind dick... I'll honest: damn, funny. Well quite tremendous leap that.

Something like: 

* miners got sick died pneumonia caused unknown virus
* virus probably SARS-like-CoV Chinese rufous horseshoe bat 
* Wuhan Institute Virology dispatched numerous teams mine collect samples
* Among samples, one collected contained virus RaTG13 96.2% genetically identical SARS-CoV-2
* 2019, WIV finished BSL4 lab construction, began studying samples Yunnan miners
* Pandemic don‚Äôt think thats true many cases. friend‚Äôs kid goes PSU daughter‚Äôs roommate tested positive covid-19. ‚Äúquarantine dorm‚Äù. According daughter, roommate time life bc everyone tested positive, therefore masks social distancing required, free party kids tested negative abide rules. one sent home all. determined safer keep school rather go home bring back families communities hope groups students following guidelines get shit together.. unfortunately, people frat parties, going already positive test..

It's shame really. always told wash hands like cut hot peppers jerking off. amazes many people i'll see public restrooms like splash water finger tips call hygiene. Well .. obviously. Would pandemic possibly make people calm relaxed? curiosity, Nevada re-infection case provide counterpoint this? dont attend? 20 community members peacefully protested disdain masks visiting Sandusky‚Äôs Kroger Tuesday buying groceries without wearing facial coverings. 

""Peacefully protested"" ass. nothing peaceful actively, willfully ignoring safety everyone around you. 

That's like driving drunk school zone 50mph saying right.  might little off-topic, anyone know safe receive packages China times?  What's controversial drug that's around decades? hundreds doctors speaking efficacy safeness treating Covid patients, yet media ignoring social media censoring them. drug OTC European countries decades! big pharma make money pushing deadly vaccine enslave everyone. Wake people! point I'm keeping track phone last time driven family cars make sure least starting driving around block times regularity. [This old posting helpful. Basically might guessed, there's formal definition psychopathy people often think entertainment media. actual diagnosis looking Anti-Personality Disorder. Trump republicans toxic corrosive fighting sort lockdown could've given us managable situation. inexcusable point.

However US politicians across political spectrum reluctant establish type lockdown, mostly afraid effects economy. Plenty Democratic states refused implement strict quarantine regulations early on. current situation much shared responsibility politicized either. daily cases currently 70, 750 peak.

Not bad state 5 million. Essentially unless n95 masks worn properly people trained ensure sealed correctly. become effective ones work people currently. preventing droplets, actually breathing filter Thanks, seem like good person too, stay safe : ) Well shouldn‚Äôt get treatment hospitals. Let‚Äôs let Darwinian thing play out. allow possibility vaccine could actually proven safe effective time frame regardless politics? awful Trump tainted conversation all, yes, need still judge objectively input entire scientific community CDC FDA. Shame! seem heading towards roaring 30s. lot businesses jobs coming back. That's big leap though. still use type mask totally unprotected, frees report OSHA compliance nothing comply with. Sadly corporate responsibility targeted reducing liability rather may best. I'm entirely sure want infrastructure hint ever built.

Even shitty infrastructure place ridicule, school districts used spy students homes, school hours, engaged school activities.

Why would want robust version place?

The trouble course relied government much, come back bite you. even rely educate children... that's almost side effect. relied could bus daycare, can't work job they're daycare. biggest driver reopening schools (even want pretend really Trump obnoxious, imbecilic politics). can't 9 yr old home day, can't supervise.

No infrastructure could fix that. still fair point though. impact climate change could far reaching impactful causing kinds problems instability. time tell plays currently looking good significant efforts made stop it. spreading misinformation uninformed lack appropriate education training. corrected lies.

If qualified comment matters, *your opinion worthless, say anything*.

You're within rights refuse take vaccine, however uninformed reasons may be. entitled spread garbage public without others correcting you. Nice one! Yes! takeaway: biotech workers slutty. body ready  Could timing announcement plan suspect? I'm sure degree University YouTube minor Hard Knocks. Hm. severe brunette woman bangs? Melbourne almost finished toughest (6 week) lockdown Australia, daily infections dropped 750 currently 70.

99% people much sympathy tinfoil want prove point right now.

During normal times (ie global pandemic), Victoria history regular &amp; varied protesting, especially Melbourne. I'm sure relief bill referring to, since there's three (The Coronavirus Preparedness Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, Families First Coronavirus Response Act, CARES Act). three lot good pieces them, important remember essentially policy making fly. speed bills passed actually really impressive. 

Unfortunately, speed manifested messy ways. duration UI *was* extends..sorta. regular unemployment runs apply additional 13 weeks Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation 39 weeks Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. 

But regular people supposed navigate Unemployment Insurance, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (the extra $600)? mention emergency paid sick family caregiving leave? messy. 

The major flaw bills Congress fell trap many us thinking worst pandemic would months, many provisions sunset quickly. credit, House Dems passed HEROES Act lot recommend. bad Senate care wanted ""wait see."" GOP falling line behind Trump's EOs seem interest another bill. are. Get rigor on! 2 people hospitalized, 1 group (414 407). believe virus dangerous flu? managed fight live fight Corona. good question. Considering India still far US testing, can‚Äôt imagine mass testing. based pattern trustworthiness. definitely follow also bunch videos American cops shooting assaulting unarmed minorities. fact, far videos this, people getting welded homes. 

Yet, American, know majority interactions police minorities result Black/Latino/Asian/Muslim/LGBTQ shot assaulted. stupid use videos go around saying American police kills minorities, common occurrence. 

So question this. common welding people apartments Wuhan lockdown? like rare occurrence commonplace thing? What?

&amp;#x200B;

That sounds fuckin tarded. THOUSANDS people old enough know better put countless innocent lives risk could essentially mediocre experience? get KN95 masks Costco website fairly readily, NIOSH approved equivalent quality mean people look obese. bother much others think prognosticate? side sit around getting triggered reactions bad news. pandemic like Superbowl choose side &amp; place bets. Live ride, ride live, Baby! Spot on, agree more. Even simple things like explaining Dr. Hahn talking earlier week -- premature trial termination DSMB due positive signal interim analysis -- less jargon aimed educating public would *world* good.

Or stop letting Dr. Hahn microphone; means well, really good communicating audience general public people already know they're talking about.

EDIT: Hell, even CNN finally starting understand basic medical ethics: alternatives, though hard find right now. hit hard filter name show media.

R95 - N95 layer designed handle oil-based particles. Think painting, pesticides, solvents. 8 hour service life.

P95 - Similar R95, N95 filter material extra layers oil-based particles. 40 hour 30 day service life, whichever comes first.

So search masks Amazon online sites still find them. course, gets posted enough places like Reddit run them... Unfortunately charge. bad PR all. amazing PR. die valuable relatively brand becomes. wait trial officially end enough data issue EUA.

And come full circle learn also can't read. Lets quote shall one thing would want see vaccine getting EUA (emergency use authorization) signal decision vaccine made Dr. Peter Marks team - controlled career appointees. Trump pressure Hahn wants. going make difference.

Yeah, like prosecutorial decisions made independent career prosecutors DOJ, weather forecasting done career meteorologists NOAA, definitely get rid 70% USDA career staffers moving Kansas, certainly screw USPS either decided rip sorting machines right election independently. DHS independently decided kidnap immigrant children DHS independently sent unidentified thugs large cities kidnap protesters, beaureau prisons independently decided launch tear gas protesters lafayette square Trump could wave bible around. 

Nope. discussing *should* happen. There's lot things happen longer function way practice. telling ""I know he's ignored every single check federal bureaucracy meant act independently, trust me, one won't."" Learning China Yeah one guy buys mask, another guy buys two masks, that's 200% increase lol. still good sales increasing ofc! Thanks depth explanation! wasn‚Äôt sure already ‚Äúunblinding‚Äù missed. makes sense. N95 masks one-way valve banned work don‚Äôt filter exhaled breath. wonder anything that? didn‚Äôt see anything mentioning valves article though Nov. 4th 5th, days matter right? Skeptical? thought Fauci reliable, non-partisan source info? says something favorable incumbent, he's suddenly suspicious person? Thanks much posting this!! Restrictions US vary wildly state state, cities even different restrictions rest state. example, heard story long ago woman driving home state Washington neighboring state Idaho (I‚Äôm assuming didn‚Äôt live far border) grocery shopping Washington mask mandate Idaho not. Illinois still pretty locked far know, Indiana Iowa (the states either side Illinois) basically wide-open. actually compassionate society. People get sick get medical treatment, actually throw wolves anymore. went fashion ago. 

However, please explain tell weak genetics. could quarantine people everyone else could continue living. 

You also probably get Nobel prize scientists currently unable predict get bad case covid. get covers made cover (and specifically fit) N95 masks vents too. Release stress November 3rd. Vote out. many died motorcycle crashes though? think BLM movement relevant post, kinda bringing hell it. 

That's getting downvoted, coming across someone trying incite something shits gigs Licensing permit expedition one thing. long that. hate able give safe vaccine (like Oxford) first line workers held building zoned retail medical something. November 4th Ok administering vaccine. Wave No.3? Agree. There‚Äôs ton variables play. Maybe first time around mild enough generate much antibody response, second time around got huge viral load via tinder date. country great shape nov 3 Trump cruise reelection Infectious Disease Society America‚Äôs current treatment guidelines recommend steroids patients severe COVID glad slap strength anytime need reminder shit lockdown future. Yes, nowhere near level Trump's America. many political posts banned shortly here? took leave well, one year without pay. relying husband's income feel safer knowing home helping children virtual school. insane year. Trump needs vaccine tout election. like it. makes sense me.. I'll borrow use irl well. Nah that‚Äôs you‚Äôre drinking water. Also, seem anxious contracting virus, someone anxiety, frequent urination result anxiety. else exploit labor lives disillusioned teenagers sake maintaining United States' grip rest world? young person?? answer question. Red card coronavirus! Ah ok, think first comment explained well. school definitely different, put trust students parents (it online school begin with). Video classes optional unless grades low suspected cheating, could set back year even expelled. think current schools switching strong-willed that, due sudden change; trying make seem ""normal"" possible. thing I've able find n95 filter addons full face respirator. vaccine actually going safe effective approved scientists? hope CDC FDA politically corrupt would ignore warnings vaccine scientists give Trump sort October Surprise heading election. Yup. Color skeptical. problem lot people want remove restrictions, would kill lot people.

So don‚Äôt mention Sweden lifting restrictions recommendations despite ever decreasing case loads don‚Äôt plan foreseeable future? Basically rest 2020. bet would eye opener looking Sweden inspiration easing restrictions. think would informative instead tired old mantra ‚ÄúSweden bad, Denmark good‚Äù. Especially since probably like ‚ÄúSweden unlucky, Denmark lucky‚Äù covid lottery. He's Swedish school herd immunity Yup Thanks. Still point beginning told shelter place one thing experts knew would spread virus. kind crazy. case nursing homes New York...shelter place place infected you. 

Like petri dish. Shocking old people died most.    Also Sweden income per capita, culture, housing, nutrition, population density cities Peru Spain. guarantee Swedish strategy either Peru Spain would make even worse already are. Viral particles exhale sick linger air still infect someone inhaling someone exhaled. 

I know there's concrete numbers CoV2 yet Influenza example linger multiple hours someone sneezed unventilated room. think good people look to. 

I dont think healthy allow media control look to. way, fear peddlers people propping Fauci. 

Fauci lied american people multiple times. lied HCQ, rather reversed statements it. lied masks. lied reasoning lying. whole thing giant ruse, Fauci core it. 

I wonder, Fauci's involvement Wuhan Lab something makes aspire higher? covering involvement? many holes. 

Cult personality. Cult media lies. Cult anti-trump conspiratorial rhetoric. least 1 person died. article No, long sentence follow ü§£ Fuck I‚Äôm angry üò° I‚Äôm reservist   realize BLM protests Adelaide Darwin exempt lockdown restrictions limiting public gatherings?

Why protests get pass? mind, people Type diabetes Irritable Bowel Syndrome goners anyway? Pray tell, resurgence Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Taiwan? said 'wearing masks since January', meant like literally everyone owned masks COVID thing, started wearing immediately. countries listed ony started wearing masks late pandemic. reputable articles saying that. problem N95's ineffective constrained supply them. articles I've seen meet defintion involve valved masks, admittedly makes problematic source control. lot people wearing masks protests/lootings/riots. Weeks? Months did. 

I went see Tenet yesterday Chicago since somehow theater two people great, said girlfriend haven‚Äôt theater since early March Onward. What‚Äôs scary spreading time. said quick six months felt like there. eerie feeling since every time go store feels like forever ago, didn‚Äôt. instructions search specific first link. feel city. Still plenty folks about, everyone nose mouth covered. Every you‚Äôll see mask-hole chin thing. Masks norm stores least year vaccine even, especially since many people refuse vaccine think answered question, bud. I'd skip.

But I'm also person would skip every possible work social event prior covid well. trust scientist stranger pandemics? Fucking casuals...  Still getting it?

Shame.

Oh well. false hope. 

There way vaccine fully released prior election. way phase III trials supposed work. It‚Äôs testing efficacy vaccine, also safety. early phases simply don‚Äôt involve enough people deliver results safety. 

Once approved efficacy safety, vaccine take months ramp production levels deliver tens millions doses per week needed. Healthcare providers front line, else? employers require it? Lots questions answer whenever approval occurs. downsides quarantine far outweigh upsides lot people, stacking bills crushed careers such. assumption person enough free time energy able go fun; plenty people working overtime order sustain family.

You indeed lucky. wonder employers start requiring vaccine employees least, many hospitals probably also require patients. aren't... Except fact young people get virus die it. comment selfish ignorant! Also people 70 older mean life doesn‚Äôt matter! 70 one day karma come knocking door! They‚Äôre accomplished liars though. do, knowing doesn‚Äôt solve problem. I‚Äôm arguing schools stay open close. can‚Äôt talk school closing terms missed education. They're respirators. N95 NIOSH rating. valves don't. fabric-like material, valves. 

Restrictions using valved masks/respirators makes sense valved exhalation filtered all. Restrictions non-valved N95 wrong done conserve healthcare workers. actually lost money trading AZN lol

AstraZeneca committed selling vaccine cost pandemic ongoing. last bit somewhat open interpretation, there's good chance making huge piles cash project. PR boost might significant though, that's hard price in. Yeah Noro knows mercy, I'd take two covid-19s Noro.

I used work sort clinic old people everyone got really paranoid one patients started developing bad diarrhea, they'd quarantined immediately, apparently they've bad outbreaks past act fast spreads like wildfire older people really susceptible it.

Nah. many sane people wear masks trust vaccines general concerned safety profile vaccine created immense political pressure without adequate testings.

There's going plenty partying going we're back ""normal"", party everyone. economic damage caused pandemic immediately go away disease does. Sure, strong rebound occur, snap back were. many businesses close many people eat whatever savings had.

I'm also hopeful return normalcy first half next year, we'll feeling effects covid-19 years come.  comment flagged supposedly contain reliable, fact-based information (which information false post?), post u/Elirmaedre also flagged.

BOTTOM TEXT r/covid19 I‚Äôm Florida. media sub wanted bad Florida. never overwhelmed biggest problem calculation take account psychology. live part US cares little virus, people thinking conspiracy ""just flu bro"" etc, case counts death counts got high enough (highest roughly 2% population confirmed sick one time...even hardened denier changed actions mitigate spread (at least somewhat). 

it would hard worst case non-mitigated spread continue perpetuity without people deciding either governmental intervention, things differently Grandpa, told people read this, embarrassing yourself! Cured corona....got jacked....dick shrank.....whatever let‚Äôs Maybe start shooting anti-maskers since obviously afraid lives. good guys, CDC (little donny) says want states fast track approval vaccine November 1st /s Yeah do, lot countries.   
So don‚Äôt get detailed political history country. may period symptoms clear body still clearing infection point virus gone. knowledge virus lays dormant like HIV shingles.

They‚Äôre hard get would hypocritical problematic doctors got wear janitors nurses non doctors couldn‚Äôt get any. could understand problems inequality create normalcy April

This well-read-but-I-am-not-an-expert-guess. Actually, think see people try push normal right away cautiously timeline starting feel normal around then. get vaccine soon possible (with certain assumptions course). obese expect less efficacy, still taking cautiously prevalence really low.

I expect full normalcy years past.  still hard come by. Expensive find them, knows they're legit. public transport. guy dealt many dead people life. Well wrong.

Some people take 6% news saying people 94% people died pre-existing conditions going die anyways.

In reality, Covid contributed 100% deaths. But, pointed out...Covid cause pneumonia conditions actually kills person. got covid, would lived longer. No, Sweden still well. infection rate still high care homes allow visitors.

But course Sweden might considered well care elderly people risk groups living lives. Really??? states somewhat..... Different. Tests back ASSUMING someone sick sending school.

Again, useless tests tell someone infected 12 days ago. next bearing today. Fear? fact. shit goes  What's difference? could find online, KN95s actually testing standard something N95s not, difference. upside ... cheap muscle cars estate auction soon. (Kidding course) yep. live work South Korea. KF94 awesome. speak, students hear clearly. Plus much cheaper rigid N95 masks are. everyone Philadelphia restaurants surrounding States suburbs would packed Philadelphia residents dining in.

They would spread virus philadelphians well dining allowed Philadelphia, would spread to/from surrounding communities.

So sure rules, violates spirit rules. Political leaders better law, model desired behavior. truth hurts guess? 

This whole social experiment given low life‚Äôs like every excuse sun blame others. Real people, hive mind Reddit understand risks take necessary precautions; don‚Äôt wish death people choose gather.  That‚Äôs Reddit general really. It‚Äôs probably good mental health get away website time time. Correct like flu vaccine always stop tends cause less severe disease, that's win. Covid going disappear, I've always figured initial pandemic period, become another endemic disease dangerous, like annual flu, ""shut society"" dangerous. wouldn‚Äôt say *randomly*, people tend die around average life expectancy. 

but concern heart warming. 
^/s know anywhere reliable purchase KF94 masks? COVID going thing finally highlights fucking miserable profit heath care system country is?

Spoiler: no, though should

Also, one dying underlying conditions rate COVID, argument fucking dumb simpletons live amongst. Amazon doesn‚Äôt sell N95 masks public. reason cases. CDC said since March N95 masks healthcare workers only, simultaneously saying cotton masks safe.

Nice one Sherlock. BMI 80. figure out? You‚Äôre astute Internet presence! make observations! People never forget reason deep shit governments prioritized bullshit pandemic preparedness. example remdesivir eidd-2801 could easily stockpiled case RNA virus pandemic (they inhibit replication like 50% RNA viruses) could developed reusable N95 UVC masks (that actively developed). SARS-CoV-2 different virus, pathogenic common cold virus immunity elderly particularly sensitive. Thanks added clarification. welcome! He's village idiot. hangs around r/conspiracy nothing say change mind he's chosen believe ramblings paranoid schizophrenics. customers America can, will, shot people death kinds things. Well give liberty life safety knowing pet dumb things Facebook I'm ignoring it. attribute one deaths COVID, would expect see deaths attributed causes *to go down.* believe seeing that.

Another example: People die HIV/AIDS. die diseases HIV/AIDS exposes to. People *can* die diseases, without HIV/AIDS, rare, HIV/AIDS makes much common.

Someone COVID much likely die another common respiratory infection.

That's measuring excess deaths pretty obviously best way understand many additional people dying early, novel disease. way good? person arrested Facebook post? Except leads infertility cancer wouldn‚Äôt seen years later. Idk. know made China that's Chinese standard. like South Korea makes uses KF94 masks. It'll blow mind green card US worth something pandemic. Decades later STILL buy unused WW2 military surplus. 5 months finally announcing national emergency still proper PPE available anywhere. understand even invoked Defense Production Act. r/wtf Oh, you‚Äôre one 6-percenters. Tell me, huge tiger rips leg bleed death, never cite tiger reason died? 

This sound. COVID causes nasty bilateral pneumonia die it, would ever think death wasn‚Äôt caused coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)? know might skeptical due coincidental timing vaccine possibly getting approval, Fauci pretty straightforward beginning whole thing. great news. K make Chinese - they're different standards extremely similar, use interchangeably. KN95 standard happens used widely China. I'm you. can't decide anxiety walking past idiots wearing masks properly anxiety making comment worse. I've made comments folks, right, pretty good chance person making comment anti-social personality disorder freak fuck you. Probably former. 25 million confirmed cases, surprising least 5 (and probably far more) people immune systems behave way average person's. comment getting downvoted cousins. guy says wears masks others really care otherwise. That's personal opinion. cares feels way. like really want ppl die, get logic behind Stop killing citizens denmark. atrocious life expectancy? Denmark getting praise dont want restrictions unhealthy living.

TERRIBLE TERRIBLE numbers, much losing. üò¨ Wow, really believed Fauci great job, see he's puppet tRump. He's really willing risk speeding vaccine process put millions lives risk there's election. really thought better that, Fauci. doubt work favor anyways. still years go vaccine safe enough hit market. Delta never expires. Even husband died, gave points account. shown people's true colours it? Nah trade China (mostly natural resources) live

You'll live even get sick. old dying get killed virus.

Deaths per 100000 Sweden January-June last 30 following 2019 ver mild flu season lowest amount deaths per 100000 30 years. Actively promoting spread uncured, unvaccinated life-threatening illness mega illegal business policy. You‚Äôre conflating two issues. Hospitals still overflow regardless whether socialized medicine (example: Italy). 

When rationing care becomes necessary, go without. Period. It‚Äôs profitability. It‚Äôs two bodies need occupy hospital bed, pick one likely survive receive care one goes without. 

Triage brutal. So, EU approves time (which likely truly efficacious)? Trump somehow influencing well? interesting articles history SARS-2's closest relative, RaTG13, term better explains meant would ""evacuating"" instead ""shutting down"" appropriate solution quarantine dorms.

That's pretty much similar first peak Spain experienced back spring. hitting 8-10k new cases per day buy unused military surplus from? Also, anyone thinks measures used stop Covid won‚Äôt somehow also affect flu misinformed. spread essentially way- masks distancing fucking great locking flu. can‚Äôt speak entire US, places still essentially lockdown like LA SF/Bay Area, flu crushed.

Fauci Recommends Students Stay Sequestered Campus Positive COVID Cases

Of course don‚Äôt want send positive college student back parent‚Äôs house infect them. get general idea it‚Äôs trash journalism. ""Tell what, get good look T-bone sticking head bull's ass I'd rather take butcher's word it"" Well comment lack comprehension mean guess understand coming now.  Trump convinced supporters isnt issue reducing testing filtering data whitehouse. means supporters likely go polls person destroy mail-in voting (the ability, reputation, both) invrease odds. believe reality. I've lied one many times, past months. every obtuse one, least 2 taking seriously. However Midwest nice preventing calling people dumb behavior outright misinformation. Data. somehow still costs $400/month Note self, make mask fleece. ‚ÄúReddit gonna Reddit‚Äù replaceability, N95's offering general public additional protection dangers face. worn health professionals certain situations greater risk COVID aerosolized, like intubating whatever else. simply ""superior"" keeping droplets mouth (or primarily, keeping droplets environment).

The better seal matter main entry vector infect taking mask off, touching eyes *after* gotten home. people breathing COVID droplets air work grocery store.  Masks generally keep droplets environment, something piece cloth 99% well N95. still expose virus, touched surface scratch nose eyes. regard additional protection offered N95 irrelevant.

I yet see anything shows outrage general public's ignorance issue. Sweden never shut down. misleading title. 

He‚Äôs telling students stay college virus bring back home spread well Thank you. vaccines get phase 3 show promise. Tell many make phase 3 wire use? ""good news."" sign corruption CDC Trump administration--they planning announce vaccine ready boost Trump's election chances whether completed phase three trials not. terrible plan? Even highschool summer camp plan would charge 1K max pocket ER visit paid like 30 dollars pay check. measure im predator victim didnt kill making unhealthy life choices....? Yes - irresponsible frankly dangerous students party without masks fail social distance. also universities bringing students back onto campus. 

If bar opened people following health guidelines, imagine bar refused serve patrons drinks paid, claiming - ""it's fault following social distancing inside bar""

Both service provider customer fault, frankly case blame schools gym opened back mid-June (Maine) going.

Where hell even coming assumption? would another wave even look like? another full lockdown hopefully? Yes could come anywhere. Including lab. Anyone dismissing possibility bright naive. boot. good news. ""dead"" vaccine recommended many sources, including Fauci, Canada, etc, take soon possible homelife, taking care caution birds.

Also, I'm sick tired irrational doom much I'm sick tired irrational antimaskers. Antimask selfish productive dangerous, Doom productive depressing.

The worlds next pandemic one butterfly effect away even still functioning OSHA? completely kneecapped yet, like FEC I'm sure many others? second wave started early July. 2.6 million people die year, would less 2.8 million average USA. Surprisingly, large enough population &lt;1% death rate quite lot people. petty. stupid senses word. n95s wear anyway. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* [Covid mortality rate anywhere 0.5 10%, covid's mortality hits ~1% population, we're looking somewhere 2.3-2.4 million fatalities. US' population disproportionately older (60+), fatality rate would indeed higher side guess, covid indeed hits elderly harder.

The flu *much* less fatal covid, around 2 per 100k (0.00002%). That's wife, healthcare worker, does. N95 wears one way valve, protects her, protect others. wears cloth mask top purpose.

Edit: found -  Clutch pearls somewhere else. Oh absolutely. I‚Äôll set aside stuff everyone knows work HIV ‚Äî although that‚Äôs comfortably enough earn respect already. 

Basically, he‚Äôs arguably last dying breed physician-scientists understands importance basic sciences medicine, *incredibly* dedicated using time resources advancing field whole.

The perfect example this: he‚Äôs running top immunology (primarily basic science associated clinical translational research) lab decades. tapped run NIAID Reagan, given opportunity hand lab research *very* talented researchers, decided still run lab serving director NIAID ‚Äî integration needed sciences medicine policy.

Oh somewhere along line, also agreed serve editor Harrison‚Äôs Principles Internal Medicine ‚Äî Bible medicine. That‚Äôs easy job, accounts, still quite well *while still serving director NIAID*. it‚Äôs like phoning roles ‚Äî took NIAID agency abjectly failing respond pandemic *years* (HIV/AIDS pandemic phase) took much competent organization. lab still churning great work. Harrison‚Äôs Harrison‚Äôs.

Any one things alone ‚Äî research HIV, didn‚Äôt even get ‚Äî would enough own. together? I‚Äôm pretty comfortable saying it‚Äôs going long time see physician-scientist caliber, someone that‚Äôs currently training physician-scientist, he‚Äôs definitely one personal inspirations. appearance Sweden reached herd immunity levels

Possibly Stockholm, rest country close exposure needed that. Watch video, cover exactly tested . wonder happen RNs? anyone listening dhs instead actual doctors epidemiologists? would Department Homeland Security give medical advice? Bigger question: would anyone take medical advice DHS begin with? told fuck off? Ok comrade go back moms basement adults fucking talking. Shocked Peru isn‚Äôt high one expected. one keeps in. answer question everyone wants know: mortality rate look like relatively healthy people 70. 

Basically 0. imagine IFR group &lt;0.0001 Nah, social media smart phone that's used control you. want give up? I'm confused works? taxes higher? I'm really struggling understand y'all 3+ months off... even coherent fucking president. Donald Trump epitome mental health honesty... okay man tell whatever [Isn't Boris Johnson admittedly ""too like obesity pre-existing condition. little exposure foreign languages zero experience acclimating.

I find thinking strange, too. I'm Australian multicultural, really exposed languages. Whereas Spanish everywhere US, signs, food products, instructions, forms, etc English Spanish it, yet many Americans can't say words Spanish even realise Spanish everywhere! Exposure definitely issue. not.a fault nature huge, homogeneous country two borders.

Australia borders huge really problem. seems mentality many Americans anything. wasn‚Äôt joke. matter testing capacity. large amount testing capacity unused, need focus testing worst places. use contact tracing test everyone might contact last 2 weeks, casting wide net. Germany even opted, cases, test whole villages/parts towns outbreaks order catch infected. love Allah ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Requirements (or lack of) suggestions two different things.

Stating one inconsistent. Furthermore, topic, inconsistent mean contradictory. Yeah far tell, 'Sweden things differently' thing really true since late May rest Europe started opening again. interesting cases dropped much Sweden without lockdown keep seeing posts along lines 'wow can't believe Sweden well without trying' reality they've sacrificed much rest Europe summer cases &amp; deaths pretty similar Europe whole lot hate comment section I‚Äôd expected. wonder why? Wrong. using CDC data everyone misinterpreting. 

Don't upvote post stuff unless understand statistics willing read reports reference. guy said true. landlords know this. corporations buying small landlords right now. know cause I‚Äôve contacted ever days brother-in-law works corporations.

The corporations gain control, higher rental prices go. Plus neighborhood, small landlords selling single family homes private owners rentals go market.

Another thing that‚Äôs going happen way people going ruin credit defaulting rents. That‚Äôs pretty much destroying many people‚Äôs future.

Tons small landlords going go bankrupt lose lives savings assume don‚Äôt give sht.

The federal government instead send stimulus checks like before, saves everyone. Even isnt spiking going bad. Texas got numbers ""control"" (although glitches highly doubt numbers accurate) everyone acting like over. Crowding bars, sending kids school, starting college. going shit show. Especially since fair chunk people right thing getting fatigue bc everyone around going out. initial comment ""Yeah, #BelieveAllChina"" distinctly implied 'believe' China (whatever might mean). new explanation still actually explain believe Chinese govt. went wild tangent instead answering basic question. campaign ad Biden. mean literally. Yet telling everyone else they‚Äôre wrong.  shoot messenger (of good news) isn‚Äôt said. yes fine. Cases mean every case critical it‚Äôs death sentence. Close 50% cases asymptomatic. Also ‚Äúthese schools keep outbreaks‚Äù school barely started cases huge exaggeration. Also I‚Äôd like know plan would be. Everyone likes shit schools opening what‚Äôs plan then? better plan? human use arabic numerals. man Fauci told Trump need close borders China beginning? Umm. think was.

Why man hailed great person due many infected ppl permitted keep entering USA China beginning? It‚Äôs lose lose Voting man thinks media enemy people, wants dissenters beaten arrested without charge, solicited political interference foreign powers multiple occasions, cozies white supremacists, consistently floated idea running third term, tried get trans people barred military service, loudly frequently declared COVID hoax, seems respect far right despots strong men world stage... 

&amp;#x200B;

Sure kid, ""middle"". curiosity, ""left social policies"" think America enjoyed Trump administration? think maybe missed point... going sound like dumb question tried going specialized ENT doctor? hard time understanding COVID still cause deaths.

Yeah, even Americans healthy, danger coronavirus would still lead 180K deaths whatever. plan keeping sick kid home. kind complain missing attendence day like describe. remember look attendence fun days.

(preschool amazed kept home husband sick cough. Like, sure, could see kids get lightly sick sick, seems like two people household runny nose, high fever, cough, upset stomach, sore throat, maybe small germ factory cough stay home too?

Apparently parents keep kids home cough.

It Feb year. Since end hospital, likely covid19, man, pandemic works stopped questioning overkill keep home.  time, did, preschool important, now? Surprisingly good decision. ....no shit? teachers support staff working school... hypothesis correct many COVID deaths unrelated wouldn‚Äôt many excess deaths far year. That‚Äôs case though. 

Source: Seems like somebody doesn‚Äôt understand science works Right. can‚Äôt therapy‚Äôd need human interaction, sorry. It‚Äôs (and everyone‚Äôs) genetics need people. suppose try deluding okay hermithood, i‚Äôd rather pay hundreds placated...again. Damn, wtf. wonder would've happened like 20 years ago highschool burned horribly suffered years depression result experiences time life. mean, even graduate highschool, though easily get GED. sure made depressed also expelled. Wtf. Anime would planet fighting back plague humans destroying it.

Just showerthought people like think ""a no-brainer"" needlessly kill ruin people's lives. Fauci knows 90% people US ""died covid19"", 80 years old, would died span years even without Coronavirus epidemic.

That demographic 50% covid-19 deaths. media challenging this, don't. Fauci con man. He's obvious con man Trump is. Go get checked out. hear Brazil's also pretty screwed up. Ligma 8005 testing done 30th. different ""symptoms""‚Äîthose subjective experiences, fatigue headache‚Äîthat patients might report convenience, signs commonly distinguished symptoms follows: something abnormal, relevant potential medical condition, **a symptom experienced reported patient, sign discovered physician examination** clinical scientist means vivo examination slightly different definition views signs indication medical condition objectively observed (i.e., someone patient), whereas symptom manifestation condition experienced patient. **A doctor may discover sign high blood pressure patient report symptoms associated hypertension, realize potentially harmful condition.** overlap signs symptoms‚Äîcertain things may qualify sign symptom, bloody nose.

I‚Äôm Missouri people don‚Äôt give fuck. think virus fake. I‚Äôm Kansas City mask mandate people take seriously drive hour sticks absolutely one mask on. It‚Äôs insane.

It‚Äôs bad getting worse. hate here. many dumbasses. doesn't. believe ""front-loaded"" hypothesis. people bandying about, suppose test proposed above. Without making value judgment, epidemiological case study. Nice see many finally agreeing enforcement walls work. Ahhh, see. Thanks response. Good luck there.  Imagine shock case control group would validate delivery method virus need blind could done small group young healthy volunteers give informed consent receive medical supervision throughout observed (for data gathering purposes whole time)

Though I'm expert respiratory disease, think could assumed designing way infect someone certain enough effectiveness high case control group needed certain close to100% infected track many people go test positive observable symptoms. effect high enough override induced uncertainty could get results quickly. entire reason masks function co2 absorbed mask order help prevent spread contagion. limit much absorb, reaches limit co2 go somewhere. mask tight (which yet see case) co2 trapped underneath mask. Otherwise exit mask atmosphere. unfortunately actually true. were, doctors would need switch masks surgery crucial medical operations. Easy, award degree posthumously. like gunshot wound. die multiple organ failures due loss blood due gunshot wound. Oh, guess ""just"" organ failures. Guns kill people. Case closed. Well, think historically nations trade think globally better overall. Nationalism work well. daughter teaches middle school many students masks, idea wear them.

Edit: school ran disinfectant week. way treat teachers national shame. Honestly problem US many mixed messages masks many different entities 

In business, always look top first, head snake.

Trump leadership tweet: never forget üíØ. believe real research happening Conspiracy subreddit noticing *incredibly fucking hard* media working scare people? true, one ever died flu, influenza primary cause death. pneumonia, stroke, heart attack actually kills you.

* Skimming

Is steal top, take little pile, swipe bit, take cut, etc etc skimming slang taking cash ""off top"" daily receipts business (or cash transaction involving third interested party) officially reporting lower total. 


So says ordered 20 boxes masks 19 boxes showed skimmed box shipment. 

Or gets box 20 masks takes one mask time order box. 


Technically stealing. Although people die still end drastically weakened months. Even athletes report lower lung capacity recovery. idea much effect organs long-term.

It‚Äôs huge waste critical limited piece PPE aren‚Äôt fit tested one, clean shaven face. Furthermore, N95 fairly tough breath properly filtering see respiratory therapists get lung capacity tests get approval wear N95s (otherwise wear PAPRs). 

So seems pretty wasteful people wear N95s unless specifically fit tested them.

But cases low. means likelihood getting low.

I find weird hear people holding Germany role model. look regulations countries much stricter there. yet cases soaring. 

Maybe mobility rates well. Many Germans working home (no traffic jams morning awesome). honesty can't explain it. regulations strict. I‚Äôm teacher recently quit rather teach face face.

""This understanding new. lockdown New York March 22 never primary cause behind **the flattening curve**. voluntarily human behavior began two weeks prior (see graph). lockdown helped.""

Careful, here. Remember goes back original ""mission statement"" interventions. ""Flatten curve"" meant ""spread damage slowly"" ""end disease"".

I think we're far apart, - there's tangible, important immunity threshold 10% 20% range puts ceiling growth leads disease tailing off. Lockdowns, distancing, interventions, masks, play zero role - sensible. play leading role *germane burnout pattern we're seeing*.

You see pretty clearly NY. lockdown, ""voluntary human behavior"" changes since March/April, receded. spread returned prior point - even close.

Google mobility data supports unambiguously - New York's retail/recreation data hit trough -75% mid-April steadily, continuously grown -20% today. period time growth virus *complete mirror image* - declined declined even interventions rolled back behavior slowly approached normal.

(should) fight infectious diseases measures reasonable relation impact society whole. measures worse disease itself.

Yes, covid. kills like 0.5% infected people, would kill really lot people cause healthy systems crash completely, period health system, also die stuff easily fixed health probably went merry Danish life thousands people died last year flu, year that.

People still compare corona flu understand anything. living make-believe world, cannot accept bad corona is. easier pretend bit like flu, feel less probably went merry Danish life thousands people died last year flu, year that.

We also things prevent flu, like offer free vaccines on.

But WAY fewer die flu corona, reasonable say lockdown even close bars whatever measure mind.

Masks though would hindsight good idea also prevent flu. Asians like decade tbh good idea done maybe scared death, thinking prevented costs.

No country efficient measures thought could prevent everybody dying. something invent, refuse understand rationality measures. 

So make people think ""we make zero people die corona"" even though politicians said exact opposite, ""we can't save everybody"", probably know that. asymptomatic cases end lifelong organ damage,

seriously folks, check profile. bot know is. Spoggles. I've seeing high cases US long wondered anywhere near herd immunity yet. 


Let's assume 200k dead US reckon right IFR 0.5%.

It shit show. Look confirmed cases deaths state.

Florida, Texas, California (not red) 2% less deaths relative confirmed Covid cases.

When get new York 7%.

Either:

A) New Yorkers sickly bunch dying twice national average. Living rat like close quarters.

Or

B) New York way cases Documented less confirmed testing didn‚Äôt exist. Like 1,628,550. Almost like people living close quarters without idea social distance etc virus hit critical levels.

Furthermore, extroversion individuality two separate cultural traits.

There cultures value extroversion individuality (US, Australia). cultures value extroversion collectivism (Southern Europe, Middle East, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America). cultures value introversion individuality (probably somewhere Northern Europe). cultures value introversion collectivism (East Asia). It‚Äôs wild different everyone‚Äôs experiences COVID are, makes obvious many different opinions mindsets.

Addenum #1: clarify lower effective herd immunity threshold due *current interventions &amp; social distancing place*. interventions relaxed, would go back higher play leading role germane burnout pattern we're seeing. see pretty clearly NY. lockdown, ""voluntary human behavior"" changes since March/April, receded. spread returned prior point - even close.

Yes, spread dropped low levels mobility increased. Isnt point? virus spreading low enough levels remains control, like states noted remained control well 20%. consistent heterogenous dispersion mobility data supports unambiguously - New York's retail/recreation data hit trough -75% mid-April steadily, continuously grown -20% today. period time growth virus complete mirror image - declined declined even interventions rolled back behavior slowly approached normal.

This assumption violates heterogenous dispersion model basing conclusion on. would expect linear association. would expect low transmission explosive effect virus reaches critical mass. Work travel still near lows. Schools still closed. Transit still substantially.

Basically, YYG line academic theory here, not. cherry picking statements, ignoring others, picking overoptimistic conclusion violates academic basis rooted optimism fact. real estate prices artificially inflated rental investors would less demand rentals people would owners.

You talk rental investors contributing wealth income inequality I'll right page.

Although think teachers group setting similar priority medical professionals. kind cloth matters.

Very much so. dozens cloth masks, made 2-3 layers 100% heavy quilting cotton good job preventing blowing through, *plus* add 5-layer filter. blowing birthday cakes one those. lighter weight cloth masks put filter might let make candle flame wobble even blow out, again, add filter in, can't even blow hairs back arm. since feel lighter, nice wear heat people sparse.

It goes without saying adding holes mask great idea...embroidery, holes straws, etc. Also, way seams sewn matter. Using filter mitigate issues necessary seams, best go add holes necessary. point talking lost causes anymore.

I point warped beliefs 8gnorance funsies. well, covid also ""estimated"" big deal never make USA.

also estimations mean jack shit have, y'know, actual numbers data. fuck *you* smoking?

the CDC shown time idea doing. sure maybe fatality rate 0.26% countries actually give crap decent healthcare, alas USA. whether people poor, fat, stressed general blunder epic proportions, whatever, death rate certainly 0.26%.

That's good point. degree US experienced late spring numbers headed downward, consensus outdoor/warm weather activities far safer indoor. many dropped guard (or, dropped masks, will), problems. Likewise, likely lot anxiety *too* optimistic open schools head back cooler weather.

A-Z supposedly plans produce many 3 Billion doses. dumb? straddling line could definitely backfire, Russia deployed vaccine even started phase 3, done proper testing trustworthy enough would take vaccine offered. agree it‚Äôs disheartening. That‚Äôs putting mildly.

If see person persons repeatedly, over, over, over, bend truth, lie, deceive, pressure federal depts lean certain direction (which favors them) - becomes difficult believe person persons even tell sky blue. Especially sky blue happens favor. 

It‚Äôs incredibly scary can‚Äôt trust truth come traditional sources. CDC saying back March/April masks didn‚Äôt help, (to help medical staff supplied stock available), showed orgs didn‚Äôt best interests heart. 

It would take multiple people respected fields, don‚Äôt stand anything gain, sway opinion. trust Fauci, don‚Äôt trust someone something gain wouldn‚Äôt threaten people loves doesn‚Äôt play ball. 

Personally, planned waiting year two see adverse reactions shake out. 

I‚Äôll getting flu shot, though.  know elsewhere, Austin one getting tested anymore. Someone posted went city's free site ones there...and yet still told would 5-8 days results.  aren‚Äôt talking millions Chinese lives here.

Two parts one:

2) issue contamination. Disposable n95s that.... disposable. much information re-use could reasonable hospital skeptical equipment control over, especially something like this. mean, surgeon ever wearing scrubs OR, hospital owned, hospital cleaned, hospital distributed, **because** contagion issues. maybe best idea context, asinine want make unable use masks donated.

Can‚Äôt wait Thanksgiving!

/s Anything see idiot shirt nose like someone farted, wanna smack fuck outta them. follow overall deaths per week. can‚Äôt manipulated nearly easily. don‚Äôt look recent week. one usually Again, don‚Äôt need ‚Äúbetter data‚Äù reject argument.

And continue claim I‚Äôm arguing bad faith, don‚Äôt make so.

One us rejecting expert consensus iffy evidence. comparing peaks noisy graph doesn‚Äôt mean much. 68 vs 65 first responded to.

I‚Äôm guessing started throwing bad faith accusation people used you, don‚Äôt make so. Well best luck, hope eventually get fully recovered! aaaaamd wont last. 

Booorn spread Corohhhhhnaaaaah vague statement ‚Äúa doctor Brazil follows know who‚Äù means nothing reality. doctor chooses believe masks, virus kills, vaccine nonsense nothing ‚Äúfollows‚Äù speaks intellect. people blindly following information put without checking validity, that‚Äôs them. educated doctor cannot think herself, speaks is. consideration author article:

Martin Kulldorff, PhD, Professor Medicine Harvard Medical School biostatistician Division Pharmacoepidemiology Pharmacoeconomics Brigham Women‚Äôs Hospital. Honestly vaccine gets released I'm interested day 1 - we've never rushed something like scale. I'm waiting least month. part afford wait. Obviously longer trust US administration, hopefully whatever vaccine first mass production joint international effort. way conclude 'safe effective' Phase 3 end year.

Literally impossible. People need top cult like mentality around Fauci

To clear *impossible* verify long term health effects vaccine end year. simply enough time. \-\_- issue using positive swab results symptoms people part original pool 

Because made part up. 

""... nasal throat swab specimens (NTSs) collected household members"". using swabs family members figure re-visit household. read actually included household swabs results? We‚Äôre downward side curve, it‚Äôll nowhere near 5%. Could producing vaccine bit even trials knowing full well need ready go immediately even means scrapping production one vaccine testing fails. lol im actually - getting tested Thursday doctor follow up! Dude fabricate cloth obscure fact it‚Äôs N95.... obviously political reasons. say would never return dumb implies infinite time 10,000 years we'd issues. wait till after... masks pretty nice use facility work at. I‚Äôd stay fuck home. get invited many parties college, you? man y'all really love government Ah, see. Thanks explanation. Let‚Äôs hope situation changes soon. much better parents, grandparents, people work businesses frequent home. 200,000 dead COVID, we're getting back fall season, cooler temperatures going boost infectious exactly way saw spring.

And telling people wear masks worse that. Cool beans. Psychopath. first shutdown? know states did, many done anything minimal. No. thought Soviets obsessed optics?? happened guys Yep analysis read earlier said even vaccine approved tomorrow real massive distribution 6 months later. Didn‚Äôt notice Scandinavia many psychopaths there. New Zealanders. first available vaccine US likely going Oxford vaccine, followed Moderna vaccine. State created vaccine US, independent candidates pharmaceutical companies, universities, partnerships two. Even office workers going back line since easier social distance office settings, someone likely going working home permanently near future happily let roommates jump front guinea pigs protect since jobs people facing. absolutely want get rid social distancing masks. love everyone miserable they're born snitches busybodies. types people would've snitching priest sexual deviancy back Puritan times.

Having real defensible excuse make everyone's lives miserable dream come true want ever end. It‚Äôs deadly. like I've begun say, education system run twats. Food banks, churches, soup kitchens, neighbors, family. shows case numbers countries adopted masks lockdowns, didn't. Humans equipped handle cold flu viruses via herd immunity. masking distancing delay virus allow make resurgence interferes development natural antibodies. Jesus lost b cells reading this. stock market up, rich people making bank, that's ""economy"" is, it? Probability healthy young person dying COVID-19 virtually zero. create closed school environments nobody gets like month, it‚Äôs done. Everybody shitting rally covid concerns; maybe rightfully so. Everyone issues RNC; fair. see outrage media concern protests? Surely protestors carry disease well, no?   South Dakota allowed spread disease Minnesota... need national strategy. also says article, 

""However, current state epidemiologist doesnt want possibly experiment spread infection society large, example achieve flock immunity quickly: 

- Experimenting spread infection dubious method, says Anders Tegnell.

Regarding Denmark Norway agree, obviously much better limiting amount deaths.

From second article: 

""Annika Linde, state epidemiologist years 2005 2013, writes Saturday Facebook ""would stupid"" ""slightly slow spread among school children parents gradually build herd immunity"". 

Something successor state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell agree with: - absolutely ambitions let infection spread way, always said want calm careful spread healthcare overburdened. Everything completely focused that, says Anders Tegnell."" Sociopaths don‚Äôt disagree sentiment, worlds big days. It‚Äôs like guys try organize tenants strikes? Action unified, you‚Äôre going lose people. people lost homes world went different. ‚ÄúManagement,‚Äù case district, never really suffers. Without real union leadership people believe in, labor breaks. Plus, even deductible pay percentage treatments get. Ahhh yeah. Great faculty, administration, janitorial food service staff too.../s bet pre-existing conditions too! anyone comments actually basic research? disallow N95s output vent unfiltered, means still easily spread Corona people sick. Airlines hospitals make wear surgical mask N95 good reason. ""Non-medical"" N95 masks basically without rigorous testing necessary medical use certification. cheaper readily available this. unlike driving European car can't sold America regulatory differences. They're functionally same.

The DHS's advice plainly stupid ""non-medical"" N95 masks inarguably better protecting others spreading coronavirus short supply.

I suppose fear increasing demand ""non-medical"" N95 masks would create economic incentive produce lieu medical N95 masks, reasons that's likely happen. 1) Medical masks higher profit margins still selling out, 2) true medical mask manufacturers produce non-medical masks, reverse true. So, buying non-medical masks result surplus non-medical masks actually work quite well preventing spread coronavirus. Cousins continued say him, wearing mask ""is really respectful people.

Fine. respectful idiot. Unclear 2nd wave virus biologically virulent, cirumstances killed people (more soldiers living together squalid conditions, bad health, taking home them). lost immature little children WANT believe entire world faked pandemic harm re-election beloved US president force wear mask because... reasons.

wow sick strawman totally people actually believe that. Nope, way anyone could skeptical unprecedented authoritarian clampdown US history reason medical procedure. Everyone country knows version dr. Fauci general medical establishment‚Äôs feeling treatment COVID HCQ maybe another drug altogether. like country does? means community herd immunity first line regardless vaccine comes Nov 3rd, regular masses avoid front line work get next year, medical staff, essential workers first line. People seem understanding global pandemic naturally speeds phase 3 trials. takes lot longer get results it‚Äôs something like Ebola SARS largely gets contained. testing phase 3 efficacy areas highly contagious disease raging going speed things pretty quickly Well, ain't virological oddity...2 weeks stupidly needless exposure. Yes. part based prior studies steroids respiratory infections like influenza. Early Chinese promoted steroids effective treatment, though much evidence support this. evidence appears steroid therapy beneficial.
Things change learn gain experience evidence. one mature enough take precautions necessary stop spread virus, perhaps one mature enough even go college. 

 Yeah, want party last hurrah kids want reach adult-hood without adding sort physical impairment live rest life flat lose life? point. think he/she's going Fauci going with. Around house everyone's going minimum 80mph. 

It seems like everyone cares virus people drive slow clogged highways pre-covid Fuck FOX news right. don‚Äôt seem need data all.

One thing sure right about, rejecting consensus. One seen substantiation all.

But know arguing bad faith. Lol, luckily deal internal employees, get know everyone people nice, like calls suck. always good laugh ahaha. Like, one fundamental aspects GUI, unchanged windows almost 3 decades ahah. 

But hey, good job security. 

What's ironic young people starting call kind questions old folk, due computer literacy tablets, phones, chromebooks, etc. instead windows.  worked restaurant busboy took ice cube bin, washed hands it, threw back bin. dont know much history. know happening past work? could super spreader one. wear cloth mask n95? get car week, sometimes less guess, where? see lot stuff Amazon. it‚Äôs anything like stuff I‚Äôve received Amazon, ehhh... hard trust. ""I hate keeping others safe!!"" Okay, question. read original memo. says ‚Äún95 *respirator*‚Äù. respirators different masks? I‚Äôm curious school thinks respirators ones cartridges sides (if makes sense) think they‚Äôre effective? Shutting colleges much impactful decision partying mask on. Well know happens Americans decide pretend pandemic over. tried May-June, July-August disaster. we're heading fall much higher baseline daily new case count May-June, people acting like again. Play stupid games, win permanent organ damage. October-November grim. Trust me, little extra seasoning makes pill taste better. Dr. Scott Atlas, radiologist added White House Coronavirus Task Force August:

How work together towards people exposed *at all*? would anyone think people endure virus needlessly? Regardless age/health? Nah medical staff elderly first. Yeah, makes sense. decided N95 masks saw RZ probably ok also it‚Äôs known company making masks years. didn‚Äôt pop yesterday.

There definitely large market people want buy effective masks self protection. trick separating good bad, right? agree more. commute, top robbing 2 plus hours day, makes exhausted time get home feel like anything. stresses morning trying get ready time.

Obviously best case scenario government never lies. human nature real problem. government said ""masks help keep others safe, please buy essential workers need them"" many people's selfishness survival instincts would've kicked millions would bought masks anyways. We're seeing kind selfish behavior people social distancing wearing masks right now. certain types people much concern empathy others. situation COVID-19 unprecedented major public health crisis individuals potential make things far better far worse. started trials would cancel them?  Yes. disgusting goes this. wear multiple masks out, try leave apartment absolutely necessary, minimize chance to- panic attack shopping bend look lower shelf kid coughed. 

To willingly go without masks social distancing drive around bike others watch Smash Mouth disgusting. Beyond optics advantage here? Maybe herd immunity solution they're going for?

I'm going comply certain bullshit what's necessary protect health. like terminate contract. Good luck finding new teacher right chaos breaks out. anything like Florida, teachers threatened entire retirements quit. wife's aunt teaches Brevard County they've basically said, quit, retire, cannot teach again, lose reaching final retirement goal (for teachers teach certain amount years get full retirement).

I genuinely believe they're using virus opportunity completely privatize education system. seems they're actively trying get teachers break quit.

I honestly hate fucking country. You‚Äôre absolutely correct, honestly, think username making people think troll. chuckled it. insulting reddit people get someone says one thing don‚Äôt agree hope gets coverage. Numerous people hospital work went keep saying "" Oh deaths super spreader event"" spam Facebook it. matter many times told takes 2 weeks things catch up. Lol downvoted even saying he's entertaining possibility. Never change r/Coronavirus state kind emergency order? mine, governor‚Äôs EO states employers can‚Äôt restrict employee PPE use, IE kind gear wear Thanks info. two masks times I‚Äôll see situation like kids arrive. next place isn‚Äôt lined yet I‚Äôm half way process buying place can‚Äôt afford risk job right now. Yes, misinterpretation CDC data pushed part organized disinformation campaign. confusing article, throwing together Sturgis, colleges re-opening, July 4th Mt Rushmore, tourists place everything organization writing.  

Is uptick due Sturgis? Rushmore? Universities students? significant uptick?  None questions answered article.  NBC ashamed themselves.  

I clicked article hoping find whether Sturgis really caused spike many us expected, like expected spike many demonstrations riots happening recently. nah make illegal sue work related COVID cases. Yeah, let's shift blame institution itself, body responsible convening people inherently &amp; demonstrably risky environment, minority students behaving foolish risky way. Good plan. fun experiment see works preventing community spread virus, it. didn‚Äôt lol kind shit ever happens work (luckily store mask rule), I'm quitting job-if make onlyfans camgirl whatever, I'll swallow dignity smile face, way hell gonna risk life dealing hordes unmasked customers every damn day either die pandemic ends. first off, apologize defensive comment. didn‚Äôt expect real reply read comment purely attempt divert neg.

Second off. Man think I‚Äôm still digesting wrote definitely see you. meatpacker comment especially - it‚Äôs true. need food, resources, even non-essentials bring comfort fun. risk huge social unrest collapse entire nation‚Äôs mental health without it. Sitting home, sitting jobs, would devastating. work homeless youth certainly didn‚Äôt take time it‚Äôs important willing to.

So think answer critical systemic issues practical. economy weren‚Äôt based exploiting workers grow process food, maintain sanitation systems, keep shelves stocked, process deliver mail - positions would easier fill afford folks ability take time thus create sort rotation system would foster least level harm reduction terms exposure. 

If systems different, technology could mean less exploitation much easier humanitarian responses crises like this, isn‚Äôt. solution include changing baseline existed here. Attempting implement kind change time like lead kind violent revolution precedes power grabs elite death working classes. 

I get you‚Äôre saying issue ‚Äúforced‚Äù isn‚Äôt semantics. Internalizing mentality leads people believe inherently powerless, cuts one‚Äôs ability see part something bigger. also taking step back thinking bigger picture here.

So guess stance successful solution here, given are/were beginning, looks like allocating funds differently. read CARES Act much money could gone toward social programs would allowed time folks, ability rotate in/out positions way benefitted financially. you‚Äôre working, getting hazard pay tax funded - doesn‚Äôt factor AGI. know myself, getting $1.50/hr ‚ÄúCOVID pay‚Äù risk bumping another tax bracket. jump stark would end owing thousands come tax time. 

I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs whole lot words actual solution but, suffice say, get point agree I‚Äôve taken time chew it. would i. incredibly selfish right imo. Lets least wait vaccine trials pan out. Wait either vaccine places start plan deal without vaccine.

Even vaccine next year medical community may well much better way treating then. could much manageable virus. Theres really imperative reason traveling internationally right now. isn‚Äôt based refusing? Nobodies refusing wear told specific areas concern - crowds etc.

Honestly think it‚Äôs laziness. Oh shit left car it‚Äôs ages away it‚Äôll sweet nobody else one! nobody see problem people basically incompetent?

Just guys. value citizens lives. value impact economy. would OK releasing unsafe vaccine killed small percent people gave immunity everyone else. They'll probably calculation accept 1% failure rate something. think Russians Trump would thing. believe science. risk people need take precautions others. Everyone needs wear mask, social distance, wash hands. world doesn‚Äôt stop turning economy can‚Äôt stop moving. It‚Äôs choice I‚Äôm fine making choice things like travel go gym long wear mask protect others. really isn‚Äôt business. saw doctor today he‚Äôs 100% supportive going gym I‚Äôm risk heart disease major COVID complications. plane I‚Äôd probably wear face shield too. husband multiple trips work entire time never become sick. He‚Äôs stayed home two weeks one. comfortable flying without precautions certainly fine. don‚Äôt know matters choose long follow CDC guidelines. suicidal isolation fun won‚Äôt go back that. good lord decides it‚Äôs time go is. can‚Äôt anything I‚Äôm going stop things enjoy fear. problem masks, people stupid. problem people supporting lockdowns complete shutdown way life. Thanks chat. ‚úåüèª think unfortunate. But, probably lesser two evils situation. time told people wear masks, United States lockdown far fewer people going now. Many lives probably saved healthcare workers access masks. even then, healthcare workers readily available masks. brother doctor beginning pandemic one N95 reuse over.  Nice try /r/wallstreetbets cool good. love cool good rich is. cool good life he‚Äôs led snitches get stitches...

whistleblowers get .....what rhymes that? I'd die go smashmouth. opposed after... Hah! I'll make sure tell wife kids made boomer lose mind today! :D doesn‚Äôt affect feel obligation make changes.. long get bi weekly check right? Well considering numbers even accurate anymore (they never were)... rip Lol agree you‚Äôve legit lost mind. OP: ""Here's article clearly describes comorbidities mean underlying conditions.""

crowd79: ""So says underlying conditions!!!""

What possesses people this? think schools business usual, teacher classroom fell ill traveling state. catch virus classroom, people may assume headline. wonder US ever return normal. üôÅ data come death certificates? imagine doctors/morticians overwhelmed hospitals filling death certificates, saw deceased person tested positive COVID-19 died plethora related respiratory symptoms, simply put ""COVID-19"" reason death. 

It's like CDC went investigate death took full history. They're aggregating medical personal reported. It‚Äôs going amazing watch sudden Reddit becomes anti vaccine. well fuck cant people running across country infecting everything tour....thats recipe disaster man

look Vegas example....

Disney World...

Last place wanna kids vs masks thing leftover WWII government issued gasmasks schoolchildren even teargassed practise, eventually gave up. @stuffofwar twitter feature discussion that.


However, adults, masks alright they're ""anonymous scary"" (complaint teacher WWII mask drills) essential health children walking biovectors even regular viruses.


Since temp probably wear mask without much worry since moving on, maybe leaving better found it? job paycheck mean fuckall incapacitated weeks virus, hospitalized, dead. 

Priorities son. teachers arent spring chickens. According article, makes guys psychopaths ü§• say, sorry. I'm doctor. Fair enough. Expect commoners get 2021 reasonably well life, relatively safe plan work toward able retired semi-retired different country. U.S. nearly unlimited downside (financially) get expensive illness, baseline medical expenses insanely high compared pretty much everywhere else. pay almost $20k per year insure two people, we're still relatively young.

In Costa Rica, could get quality care well $2000 per year.

It might worth thinking selling home turning rental using money fund pretty good life low COL country.

So options letting entire net worth get sucked void first time get cancer.

Or, almost bad, minor illness kill costs fortune control. mean I've seen many reddit bashing comments use words like ""degenerate"" ""basement dwellers"" ""hivemind"" words really alert they're using rhetoric spewing opinion already had/they'd seen someone else share. see trading record? I'm curious inside info has. think anxiety lot people. narrative starts turn ""it's getting better"", easy afraid everyone else going take sign relax completely things going get bad again. Anxiety creates controlling behavior lot time. that, going determine priority. Seems make sense healthcare workers first. Beyond that, know elderly sick highest risk. Ultimately, people die vaccine itself. needs determined risk disease also risk dying vaccine.

Furthermore, need know long lasts. Evidence emerging immunity disease likely lasting 3 months so. vaccine lasts long, unlikely, often people need get vaccinated.

The amount conspiracy theories arise vaccine trump (no pun intended) seen date.

Further yet, effective vaccine. Flu vaccines hover around 40-60%. get guaranteed protection get vaccine especially occur overnight. likely 6 month period. No. COVID listed contributing cause death death would happened without COVID. TBH teachers school talking last year issues district. wonder happen ""I survived Sturgis 2020"" t-shirt üòï Sure, needs fact checked part presented moment. countries factors could lead increase cases like opening early? 

I noticed people think mask need alot. meant used hand washing sanitizing distancing. could helped people using better masks distinction made studies people take masks face covering mask. isn‚Äôt, come guys, world waiting two experts reddit end debate. kinda saying basic proper things. sad even say mask!

I'm suspecting within 1xx,xxx deaths we're going see also going bunch deaths going see anyway, they're going counted among covid deaths. Rightfully so, I'm saying potentially going see 6 digit ""extra"" deaths 2020 average year. think we're seeing dying spring instead fall. 
If guess, I'm here, I'd say end 50-75k deaths norm. 

We'll see though. Interesting winter coming sure. you, Dr Fauci! don‚Äôt know we‚Äôd without you, honestly.

Nothing says taken face value. He's already shown he'll lie shallow greater good. debate whether 9000 people died, whether not, based 6% statistic healthy people, lockdown really justifiable 2020 since March, raw number excess deaths 200,000 people normal year. try understand that, COVID-19 rational likely explanation. believe COVID-19, try pinpoint year different other. would new disease kills people cause?

I wonder also much (if any.... ) lockdowns etc affected ""expected deaths"" causes would normally there...

EG fewer poeple road reduce road deaths?
Did immigration / border closures stop flu arriving?
Did fewer people elective surgery reduce post-surgery infections/deaths?
etc.

I suspect data analysed, ""raw deaths"" lower ACTUAL covid-related death. Sadly. Great. Anything else wanna add? Ccp lies it, covers destroys genome sequences/evidence... Fauci career doctor position power long. agenda.  ‚ÄúFauci clarified CDC‚Äôs recent report states 6 percent (approximately 9,000) 183,500 COVID-19 deaths attributed coronavirus infectious disease expert pointed figure simply means COVID-19 caused 9,000 deaths without causing pneumonia, cardiac arrest, complications killed 94 percent people contracted data ‚Äúdoes mean someone hypertension diabetes dies COVID didn‚Äôt die COVID-19. did,‚Äù Fauci said.‚Äù

I'd rephrase that. 6% death rate makes sound 6% infected die underlying causes. stat 6% deaths contributing causes. a) study proof concept testing protocol test efficacy masks

b) protocol includes testing aerosol sized aerosols, small stopped cloth surgical masks (generally anything tight seal).

This false example perfect enemy Motorcycles illegal what? cryptic? I'm sure realize stuff like attracts trolls, good explain people honestly know answer asking good faith :) feel surveyed cross section Americans would respond lives equal. course nitpick casual generic statement. course claim good ole boys would pause second say Americans except criminals ""thugs"" equal. 

But, I'd say public school indoctrination follows people equal thought, Americans tad bit better due manifest destiny junk.

Even taking away, BLM COVID diacussion folks leveled ""all lives equal"" thought.

Ultimately used ""royal"" sense apply generic populace, 100% assure wasnt targeting :p great great uncle (yes, two greats, he‚Äôs grandma‚Äôs uncle) lives Arizona karaoke regularly. went May soon bars reopened. got COVID hospital twice month COVID-related heart attack hospital. obese, mid70s, diabetes.

Ah 10k died Covid, 180k died nonrelated issues. Yes, blame Trump haters. could asymptomatic symptomatic exposed virus... many variables need quite things. Help.  went Beijing years ago. CCP shady stuff mean come on, unfair double standard you‚Äôre making doctor put obesity diabetes hypertension one causes death... die weight due heart failure, gonna see naked eye lol. 

The whole reason 6% healthy individuals dying covid19 stat brought point hospitals agencies fraud numbers cases. 

By enough evidence cases fudged.  complications, 90%+ cases, advanced old age usually residing nursing home. die stubbed toe 92 years old. Fauci full shit.  Well thank God cleared problem filter well wearer. However, mask mandate protect everyone wearer. valve‚Äôs purpose allow wearer breath easier allowing free flow mask. good filtering exhaled breath. airlines starting ban them. said, every valve type mask may same. Masks protect you, protect others stopping droplets limiting spread aerosols. 

Edit: told protect somewhat, thanks üòä

A face shield protect (somewhat) based data influenza.

Wear going exposed people virus.

Edit: wear mask anytime go anywhere people. Cuomo sent covid patients nursing homes/LTC facilities, idiotic. also happened get unlikely NYC epicenter US outbreak time little known virus.

The failure ramp testing federal abomination states suffered it.

Honestly, think virus going virus burns goes portion population, mostly people give shit essential workers choice about. states poorly states highest populations. death rates vary states.

Surely would done much better different president, loathe Trump, believe covid would still infected killed quite people. new study. *not* demonstrate gaiters bandanas worst, designed so. confirmation testing Low-cost measurement facemask efficacy filtering expelled droplets really aberration. Anti-bodies providing absolute, 100% blanket immunity every single individual would aberration. isolated cases people susceptible reinfection expected people naturally immune.

For familiar example, 100s people get strain flu twice season. people get vaccinated flu still get sick covered strain quite common.

One things scientists trying determine much immunity anti-bodies (and components immune system like &amp; B Cells) certain levels provide. it'll take numerous studies like look different variables build knowledge base deep enough make authoritative estimates.

But empirically, based things like number survivors health care gone back work repeatedly reexposed *not* reporting large numbers reinfections, likely immunity rate much closer 99.9% coin flip. Correct! It‚Äôs also stores ‚Äúbeing open.‚Äù mean huge disparity people still sheltering place like it‚Äôs March others seeing friends want sheltering friends come see too. Even every business open, we‚Äôd still social limbo Yeah did. guess way headline written expected direct quote colossally stupid sign one trials? Even worse didnt actually say it, put spin it. Jesus get here!!! Hahaha could wrong... seems prevented European strain entering. keep good shape. 6%. Fauci credibility. We'd still seen cases, especially west coast original mutation Italy mutation documented.

Furthermore, ""strains"" incredibly distinct other, unlikely antibodies would completely ineffective. ever China? 100% agree - mean someone murdered even crime, right? sentencing hearing consider fact X% chance person would died something next month so? think whole harm caused killing people thing overblown. people choose care people killed?  many people underlying conditions people died survive show symptoms? numbers match seasonal flu? I‚Äôm confused number. CDC team doctors? believe team trained doctors Fauci? Whoa, goalposts shifted quickly.  wait September ends... Lol that's said. said died Covid, would alive today absent Covid, would stupid claim doctor next sentence discusses comorbidities... We‚Äôre helping develop vaccines could really distill list #5 #17. Probably thing. mask blunder set us back months CDC ESTIMATES 12,000-60,000 flu deaths per again, where‚Äôs source says almost 200,000 Americans die per year flu?

Hmm? Nothing?

Oh look, even specific info says 61,000 Americans died 2017-2018 flu misinformation BS elsewhere. often. still look ways crossing street, right? Wuhan Strong! :D cousin goes stayed home semesterüòå congenital heart condition  would without guy runs biological weapons tests unwitting US citizens?

The guy likely created profited AIDS virus?

The guy oversaw millions grants WUHAN biological weapons lab?

The guy directly profits response vaccine?

Probably world would better without tbh really rule reddit full text article posted comments. many news sites uses cheap headlines get clicks social media. glad hear Wuhan bouncing back demoralizing time like that. First time? love attracts trolls ask matters, since everyone dies eventually anyway. know? Last year, people died things besides covid? think people living considered this.

Do people analyze statistics realize this? everyone dies? kinds things? Maybe first person think this, someone tell experts idea... Danish cases currently dropping virtually rate Sweden‚Äôs dropping last two weeks. 

Denmark dropped 37% last two weeks

Sweden dropped 40% last two weeks

Like said, let know number new cases per day Denmark exceeds Sweden Lol. Good NPC. Good Komrade! stay safe bathroom.... call bs that's selfless, Gene. Don‚Äôt technically die cardiac arrest? Obviously, everyone pitching in. think America could help developing vaccine? ""COVID-19 caused 9,000 deaths without causing pneumonia, cardiac arrest, complications killed 94 percent people contracted virus.""

Sorry, sentence article comment. sentence ambiguous. Covid caused complications killed 9000 patients. 94 percent preexisting conditions caused covid. Covid killed well. don‚Äôt know. Americans? sure. 

There‚Äôs definitely cultural things place China make tolerable. saw videos people taken away apartments forcefully thrown vans street. think exception rule. government ordered quarantine went.

üêëüêëüêëüêëüêëüêë I‚Äôm talking flu *and pneumonia* deaths. [As August 22, 271k deaths pneumonia, influenza, Covid-19. 168k coded Covid-19 deaths. That‚Äôs leaves 103k deaths attributable flu obviously deaths misattributed, it‚Äôs entirely possible 103k significant portion (say 40-60k gap excess deaths) actually Covid-19. becomes likely consider normal deaths whole year *especially* high summer normally drops significantly, first time recent history miraculously gone up. Saying global *influenza* virus pandemic spiking **exact** moment pneumonia influenza deaths also rising (against normal trends) coincidence blatantly ignoring obvious.

As I‚Äôve shown resources:
1. sufficient # pneumonia influenza deaths explain excess death gap.
2. symptoms overlap greatly it‚Äôs even recorded 70k died pneumonia Covid-19.
3. Flu &amp; pneumonia deaths way seasonal norms.
4. time flu &amp; pneumonia deaths increased they‚Äôve historically started decreasing.
5. world taking measure year past 100 years fight flu spread, yet deaths related diseases (I.e. pneumonia) up.
6. rise deaths coincide spread Covid-19.

Those 6 reasons, there‚Äôs likely much could said. makes believe despite facts it‚Äôs possible Covid-19 explain gap excess deaths? It‚Äôs 20-30% increase reported figures. alternative explanation outside cancer heart disease would require much substantial increase 20-30% simply isn‚Äôt present data. isn‚Äôt 40-60k excess deaths category excess influenza pneumonia. Sometimes obvious answer right answer. ? Okay, universal health care support system people fall cracks even conversation. 

Problem solved everything want.



Look, people always choose shit circumstance handed them.. sometimes happens.


I've hell rough time back 2008. choose it. I'm professional wife. choose loose jobs. happened.  even get hired fast food company. Shit happens. kids crap job that's get time being...you shouldnt forced streets. 

Yes, lack empathy. People usually realize it. best people task force catch asymptomatic? employers policy, sick, suspect sick, contact somebody sick call off.

But get 5 sick days year, can't take unpaid.


So basically, come work sick, unless sick, guess come Monday matter what. am/have withdrawing kids public schools hate it. must thrilled. Acceptable casualty.

For nation lives kids, sure shit treat horrible. Im fairly sure dogs protections Yeah but. gave freedumbs. too. I'd rather ""suffer"" indignity mask, social distancing curbing exposure truly suffer COVID little known long term consequences. whole side ""it kill me, could give someone may killed it...."" True suffering. Uhh company 4 day work weeks, paid benefits 1 week vacation 90 days, 2 weeks year.

I pretty good work life balance American. Everywhere go, like 99% people wearing masks. mask wearing population closer ""everybody"" ""nobody"" ability pull together isn‚Äôt used be. period time going receive lot scrutiny. believe real value future teaching worst case scenario based administration's actions inactions. took almost three weeks ‚ÄúChaos ladder‚Äù - GOT http://www.kykernel.com/news/data-explainer-uk-student-cases-of-covid-19/article_68270fba-ebe7-11ea-82e2-975723d7d99b.html 

Here‚Äôs article student newspaper better explanation rise case numbers. Oh that‚Äôs good hear ! mean medical grade ones? see rationing month 7 going help. stock isnt adequate now, never might well save yourself. oh saying hateful people.

Just boomers, large, fucking worst across board. Studies shown steroid treatment original SARS led dire long term side effects. Doctors documented consequences Asia avoid using steroids COVID. west pushing sort miracle cure without acknowledging risk permanent disability. boss saying tik unless Microsoft buys it. Also let Walmart, Google SoftBank make bid security expertise fr Microsoft SoftBank foreign almost Chinese like. Even though ceo Korean Japanese backing still allowed part new tmobile. DT ok German though. 
But Walmart Microsoft would ok make sure get a.cut.  right attitude. wanting go-to Home Depot without mask. Maybe. hope enough money survive till wrongful termination case goes court, let alone money legal fees, income. kinda understand this... work retail wore N-95 eight hours day. lot air getting there, take toll you. 
Before say I'm whining, ended fainting one day it. doctor told wearing N-95 could potentially dangerous wearing mask all. 
I'll honest though, N-95 factor caused faint, possible could mild case anemia. switching cloth mask, nearly bad problem like since.
I'm saying N-95's effective wear all, risks come wearing frequently. Maybe evidence garbage. haven‚Äôt seen anything higher quality pointing particular direction.

Nah, it‚Äôs best data find defend Florida Covideracy, you‚Äôre either way argue bad faith.

You amount proof assertions. happens leaders federal government stupid evil. 

Hopefully fix November. I've gone fewer people around, gym good mask adherence felt quite safe. want know risk level, try tool, provide estimate relative risk based number cases area bunch factors. debt die estate (but I'm attorney, probate otherwise, understanding could wrong). course, lots varies state. Tennessee, husband died unexpectedly, hook hospital bill, signed paperwork accepting financial responsibility. he'd owned home, investments name only, life insurance (which - even get started THAT) assets would used pay bills. married four months, living house bought met him. gotten around adding title died, mine alone.

Likewise, die, estate (my home, checking/savings, retirement account - meager though is) responsible debts. Luckily, carry much debt beyond mortgage car payment, life insurance cover. home worth $250,000, leave $500,000 worth debt? son ends nothing estate pays can.

Not mention, get sick enough can't work all, eventually company ""administratively terminate"" me, means I'd use COBRA (which nobody afford working, unless they're already filthy rich), Medicaid. 

It's colossally fucked scenario, work whole lives, end poverty - leaving nothing families - medical expenses.  mention trauma survivors lost loved ones. don't? handful people generating antibodies due immune system functioning properly prove anything ""the strand flu didn‚Äôt disappear. influenza virus continuously mutated, passing humans, pigs mammals. pandemic-level virus morphed another seasonal flu."" that, first mutated least one strain lot worse initial strain... it? painful place existence. never truly understood addiction couldn‚Äôt leave That's we've thinking since beginning. least people i've talked have. really hope there's virus mutation significant side effects vaccine. shortest time ever create successful vaccine took something like 7 years. understand better tech now, think create one works year pretty speculative... case, would seen sorts lawsuits enmasse past.

But not.

This new.

This money grab $7000 semester shit learn Udemy Khan Academy 

It complete bullshit charging full price tuition. I‚Äôm even getting level education. sent professor email problem I‚Äôm class week ago. Still response. ask question zoom, get ignored. I‚Äôm seriously pissed. 

Also, computer complete POS. school helping that. informed get loans ‚Äúend September.‚Äù struggle complete class work. 

This fucking joke. filters? Things already air get lungs. Worst case: things get put back air would anyway. Better case: viruses put back air old broken down. He's close Trump European country ever got.  sure overblown means even vaccine could get again... know sub on? =) died car accident tested positive coronavirus chalk corona death. 200k gross overstatement people really whole time? Yeah, bars, concerts, sporting events (either audience participating much), big parties. like...people going camping, going work, going eat restaurants outside, etc. Rather backfiring, literally proving point virtual learning better? 

That school wants us teach go back hybrid model. I'll teaching classroom broadcasting via Zoom students chose stay remote. clue they're going hear mask Zoom mic. death rate Italy hospitals failing around 8.4%. combine statistic growing likelihood previous infections may [confer long lasting increased spread rate winter (all coronaviruses higher infection rates Winter), looking one wild ride come November. get lied really think looked consequences would be. instance, think people wear mask stupid, government initially strongly validating claims start give ground continue refuse wear mask.

I think bigger issue credibility, though. lie beginning means one end, switch position end achieved, really look like know I'm talking about. probably biggest reason covid/mask deniers, fact government looks pretty dumb change stances like that. current boomers charge finally die MAYBE happen. worst.

We thought 60's thought 80's. Every generation breeds new hateful people. Millions, tell you! MILLIONS SARS!

...just saying put unit measurement, maybe. Oh wow!! person sense sub! friends! üòÇ still shortage n95 masks

There available internet 5 minutes. found 3M N95s online 25 seconds available door 9/9.

Again, really b simple. Yes, that's exactly like. Though life can't imagine end game here. Yes, killing poor POC also killing plenty GOP voters well. Sure, worth trying. Saying pericarditis gastroenteritis caused covid purely speculative two conditions present together many illnesses. Even worse illness auto-immune haven‚Äôt seen rheumatologist. COVID absolutely cause things, again, speculation. 

I‚Äôm well versed COVID anti-body test, wonder find titers, detect antibodies illnesses years ago. know hospitals wouldn‚Äôt allow brought-from-home N95s, due liability risk (someone suing hospital giving COVID due improperly checked equipment).

For schools even stores, doesn‚Äôt make sense. They‚Äôre already told use masks home, would matter (granted, unless it‚Äôs fitted properly lose personal benefit, traps droplets spreading others). size it? outside USA. see anyone talking China's provinces? mitigate hospitals pushed limits. people change bars. Well hospitals area may full ton deaths. we'll 6% truly die virus. 
We want like places seem somewhat able test contact trace keep check along masks social distancing. real, comes price. America's case, projected death toll 2 million more, probably much more... possibly much 5% entire population. [edited got maths wrong] law illegal firing? thought people allowed refuse unsafe work without getting fired. get it. trying callous ass. us things we'd rather needed money - whether dance strippers pole, risk health coal mine, miss kid's birthday party finish report office.

Your sister bind sure, think using word ""forced"" makes seem like choice, makes seem victim is. turn makes easier ""force"" others things.

Another aspect people want everyone stay home get paid. Well works weeks months, perhaps, eventually everyone sitting home starts really impact goods services. get stay home get unemployment meat-packers work? life valuable? stay home everyone going eat? 

Covid sucks. killing people, financially breaking people, making people sick. Every person allowed weigh costs benefits staying home staying healthy vs getting poor. easy choice expect make anyone else, would expect anyone else make me. Again, covid sucks. ‚ÄúSick‚Äù means overweight context... basically every American risk category. Could be. don‚Äôt really know that. 

But ‚ÄúThe Architect‚Äù. know. forget immunity lasts 2-3 months, see beginnings benefits herd immunity million people dying *every month* hang here? want rational discussion, go r/COVID19 We're run fascists currently definitely angry enough vote determined get regardless outcome vote. Absolutely! could said virus! Like said.. wear mask, etc. don‚Äôt act virus deadlier is. 

My point people back March, April, May every reason stay home scared we‚Äôre surviving living.

I‚Äôm probably gonna get downvoted hell it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous people insist isolate, stay indoors, act know nothing virus, affects you, treat it! So, least let wear KN95s bought almost anywhere. take account incredible number people die due hospitals overwhelmed. Like see authoritarian Christians. male conservative Republican Congress, secretly temporarily become pro-my-choice, pay secret affair abortion. Northeast Midwest US, I'd expect numbers go gets colder people spend time indoors. Can't imagine it'd nearly bad saw spring summer though.

I expect much rise southern states got hit hard summer, FL/AZ/TX, winters cold outdoor activities easier vs intense summers. Right, yes disposable N95s different. it‚Äôs strange they‚Äôre allowed. Looking last pandemics, vaccine ready 4 months 1957 Asian Flu 1968 Hong Kong Flu (4 months time made west vaccine). Apparently even worked vaccine 1918 Spanish Flu, can't quickly find long took. recently 2009 H1N1 vaccine developed. 

So answer question, believe pandemics last 100 years stopped via herd immunity. Terrible article ‚Äúsources‚Äù said. I‚Äôll add also completely overlooks non-mortality results Covid. ‚Äúlong-haulers‚Äù cardic damage mild asymptotic cases name two. future impacts individuals contracted Covid-19 still fully understood. say open lock old folks dangerous misguided opinion. get doctors note says wear one. Works shithead coworker refuses wear mask. found doctor signed wearing mask exposing rest us. Could referencing N-95 masks exterior valve could still relase particles? Maybe matter poor nomenclature confusion. even right, us get it. 26 million cases worldwide 8 month period, organ damage widespread would likely seeing effects now. That's happens purposefully contaminate nursing homes respiratory infection.

Take look NY death rate stats.. 


0-17 years	0.69

18-44 years	21.78

45-64 years	207.83

65-74 years	675.28

75 years older	1,703.73


The flu deathrate 5 17 year olds 1 way... agree 100% everything said  come conclusion? one wishes Fleece would work better, mean winter coming wanna warm lol company work allow n95 masks one-way valve protects wearer others. Yeah thats true- one deciding figure, nevertheless major contributor policy gather interviews. Also deregulation smaller government bodies aside military. account fact documented proof get virus multiple times. exactly herd immunity suppose happen without vaccine?  countries shut sizes one states. states significant cases fact shut appropriate. pro-life, pro-birth. help slowing spread

By dragging out. I'll grateful subreddit discusses rationally instead /r/CoronavirusCirclejerk times barely distinguishable /r/the_donald. mean, totally right rollout overnight. expect medical staff/paramedics doses available November timeframe everything goes perfectly, high risk government-defined essential personal (Not essential workers, people stuff like fingers nukes) potentially receiving first doses December, limited ""general public"" doses starting show January aimed risk dying. see end February/early March timeline general public may able start scheduling doses hospitals research institutions due cold chain requirements two US frontrunners. wrong people? genuinely concerned people can't comprehend necessity masks quarantine. Even think ineffective mountains evidence showing are, also mountains evidence show without transmission greatly increased. entire countries followed guidelines relatively back normal. wrong us America?

I researching much would cost get COVID test depending go could cost $1000 dollars. make sense? pandemic millions people unemployed since insurance linked people's employment, expected pay it?

I feel though make drastic changes America never recover, global soft power evaporate without ability use diplomatic sway sanctions get way evaporate.

I scared America also duel citizenship ensuing civil war mine fight. mean Trump's new man pushing herd immunity knows who's listening who? employer employee died became seriously ill pandemic? problem employers done possible precautions well employees contracted virus somewhere else. 

In principle could sue employers followed state/city/country set guidance, good case class action suit non-compliance must wary massively among employers. longer class action suit, every single case needs looked individually proven individual case employer culpable death. 

Further complication comes fact clear lot cases transmission happen work. So, we're talking rare condition almost certainly connected practice company (say dumping toxic waste environment), widespread pandemic infected people everywhere regardless work status. practically impossible prove conclusively case got transmitted. 

In case, would find kind lawsuits pretty repugnant. happened #wereinthistogether went instead, ""I want punish employer idea year world would hit disease would wreck business, also turn employees him"". ‚ÄúYou longer wear bandaids wound care. Casts kind broken limbs forbidden. may wash hands soap, even provide own. Hand sanitizer alcohol get fired, immediately, possession.‚Äù Dude think it? Obama 9/11 happened??? I've probably seen doubt vaccines anti-lockdown people anything. always say things like can't afford wait vaccine unlikely come time soon, even though there's pretty well-supported timeline now. exactly correct. ones unfiltered vents disallowed. meant delete duplicate reply made, accidentally deleted wrong one. think it‚Äôs dangerous, fall .5-1% population. hope so. person's beliefs alter consequences actions, goes ways.

If lenient completely undermines rules. That's like putting entire fire part house REALLY fire. little fire smouldering corner different, little behind. believe 93% didn‚Äôt get sick got sick never went hospital got better. 7% enough hospitals run past simple fact hospitals don‚Äôt respirators even 50% patients hospital. 

At point confirmed cases going places it‚Äôs months since I‚Äôve heard hospitals nurses complaining PPE, equipment fight covid, testing hospitals run.

I think that‚Äôs HUGE point. Hospitals run people coming covid-19 needed ventilators hospitals ICU clearly can‚Äôt handle large influx patients. 

At point hospitals handle 7% people preexisting conditions. Yes, people still dying yes sucks isn‚Äôt scary ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù killing old young alike. least like pandemics us taught school. feel same, dude. Luckily don‚Äôt deal since, know, got fired that. it‚Äôs absolutely insane. didn‚Äôt get invited many parties college, you? Actually, countries wearing masks seeing pronounced resurgence didn't. prolonged inevitable. We‚Äôre talking two separate things.

I‚Äôm referencing version N95 valve talked upstream prohibited.

In cases, N95s, mask filter.

You‚Äôre referencing vast majority consumer masks filter pockets, wherein mask merely carrier vessel filter insert. again. guess Karen anti-masker thing dead? professors get suspended dinner party without mask? exactly right imo cannot simply say ""close schools"" without talking plan response lack childcare. cannot find anything Costco that. sure that‚Äôs Costco idiot manager stating that? N95 masks one-way valves. Ones construction often do. many don't. stock eBay extortionate prices. ‚Äúrules thee me‚Äù

What rule put place one else anyway? one stopping anyone did. comment makes zero sense. Overall city well test positivity rates cases slowly trended summer long. cases initial wave spring.

The big issue Kenney going eat another city phila done well restrictions sacrifices businesses residents. make sacrifices told densely populated area need distance order protect others. 

If Kenney goes eat another state exposes people dangers... Kenney care people? overstating need continue lockdowns Philadelphia proper? No, that‚Äôs blinded studies work. don‚Äôt get ‚Äútrickle‚Äù anything let alone selectively unblinded data, defeats purpose trial. people afraid customers? hear ALLL time justify stupid shit.

Oh can't raise price stamp it'll scare customers, better go bankrupt instead.

Nobody wear masks work! scare customers off!!! - Meanwhile 70% people would go nobody wearing mask 30% get hardly care either way. Maybe it‚Äôs don‚Äôt enough masks go around? VA sent memo counter-factual mask guidance‚Ä¶to doctors! Later came that, yes, government weren‚Äôt enough masks. saw someone comment international leisure travel never return. Come fuck on.... lazy replace filters protected. like types masks Costco allow protective. least allowing people wear N95 masks responsible change filters ability stay safe! Lemmings No, topic people dying. said people like Sweden's approach want restrictions. hy applicable outside corona?

Even though 5800 people died Sweden due corona way died reasons public health decisions make impact. Good thing doctor reads science. Gaiters worse nothing. illegal. That's irrelevant dead. Getting there! Hopeful return new normalcy October. need another 90 days? NJ NY still worst states covid19 deaths. agree cant simply ignore effect bad economy lives americans. economy stock market big corporate earnings. elevated likelyhood infection.

Its America. protect people morons Australia. don‚Äôt need 99 percent killed reduce spread. half life 111 mins set dials way left. yes talking typical winter day, talking typical summer day.  could data. reddit doesn‚Äôt seem understand nobody gets see data independent group collected verified results unblinded. Fauci seen phase III data anyone else. Oh great, Murica first, contributing international vaccine effort, either win vaccine race we‚Äôre super selfish shit luck don‚Äôt good one. Oh wait mean it‚Äôs big bad running N95s amazon. KN95s wore N95 12 hour noc shifts back March. definitely difficult wear extended periods time. It‚Äôs like speaking hyperbole! Survival fittest means showing pads guess? ‚ÄúIf get CTE, get CTE‚Äù 

Same deal, right? sick dead horse ‚Äúnecromancered‚Äù back life put back meat grinder... shit. Lol. last guy really trust good news local corporate policy? r/maliciouscompliance Welll fair N95 masks short periods wear around 3-4 hours fine wear day good chance suffocating yourself. - kn95 least using materials design trap hold particles. may tested created another country, equate piece cloth respirator sort. Given city 6th largest country dense poor areas high death rate surprising.

Overall city well test positivity rates cases slowly trended summer long. deaths initial wave spring.

The big issue Kenney going eat another city phila done well restrictions sacrifices businesses residents. make sacrifices told densely populated area need order protect others. Kenney goes eat another state exposes people dangers... Kenney care people? overstating need continue lockdowns Philadelphia proper? election-year politics, I'm guessing. I'm personally concerned vaccines fact history taken long perfect vaccine. I'm trying doom gloom concerned fast tracked vaccine. Nothing agenda, unless agenda using useful factual data paints accurate picture situation... though I‚Äôm sure tracking case numbers super helpful yours. It‚Äôs inaccuracy case numbers given time makes pretty meaningless metric. don‚Äôt think anyone outside medical professionals get reliable supply authentic N95 masks. 

The best tell saw crate N95 NIOSH approved masks Lowe‚Äôs made RZ Industries days ago. come slip says ‚Äúnon-medical‚Äù, fact NIOSH approved makes better, eyes, lot masks. 

I small face, seal. mask lot smaller lot masks tried. think fit people ok. 

Personally, able close gaps mask wearing fairly tight cloth mask it. It‚Äôs little smooshed inside, it‚Äôs definitely harder breathe, feel like works well. 

I‚Äôm always lookout better, that‚Äôs now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è every KN95 China faulty flu vaccine certainly protect covid19, may actually increase risks

Does bother link literally zero Covid-19? know know? published 2012 based data 2008-2009. Notwithstanding, study states findings limited small sample size small number confirmed infections. Wait, DHS? Departnent Homeland Security? DHS? makes fucking sense would chime in. Stupid. order Australia's economy well, rest world \*needs\* well. Also, COVID exactly best thing happen country's economy 70% service-based.

Population growth part reason Aussie's well also comes number factors including close linkage china, abundance national resources, huge boom corporate sector, consistent growth time.

Australia's public utilities reformed within guidelines set nation's national competition policy drive increased national efficiency competitiveness - means productivity (across every sector) saw boom.

But comes social distancing violations city, sing like Sammy Bull.  Funny, got reminded bot 4 weeks ago warned someone give time start september see low positivity sustainable thing. 

:D Good riddance pattern across two ""waves"" hit U.S. consistent lockdowns, distancing, masks, varied broadly timing compliance across NY/NJ/MA AZ/FL/TX, reasonable candidate main driver.

Mobility declined significantly yet reached pre-pandemic levels. understand everyone quick fail even consider literally effective widely implemented NPI, even though implemented people self interest. Even papers show lower HIT depend cohorts uniformly interact. predict new burst cases infected cohorts start hitting cohorts people protecting themselves. find boat go usajobs.gov see have.

There several specific situations insurance pay out, like lied application got murdered beneficiary.

If infected *right now*, probably switch life insurance carriers, could pre-existing condition. Obviously life insurance work wait get sick buying policy. subreddit turning Fauci? going okay, 500 new cases day. 

I'm however worried winter. People huddling together indoors, without protection, combined flu season. schools opened, see. doubt it. automatic data collection hospitals every country medical research. I'm pretty sure WH unaware this. much hope unaware this.

But yes, US meddling reported data since beginning pandemic worrying. would thought country invented checks balances would checks balances. Instead behaves exactly like communist dictatorship would: ""Nothing see here, move along. produced 3 million boots last month, ever before"" Probably dieases exist people die time come.

Why even fight diseases? People going die anyway! can‚Äôt wait see written history books. I‚Äôm going start writing disgusting policies certain companies enacting kids/grandkids use school projects future. Yes thst filters input, also need filter breathe out. Thst keeps spreading it. mean... pandemic-related things decided experts, politicans really much say it. believe case study January. Given public transport opened India, worrisome. I'd interested know would happen commuters bus wearing masks. study linked information whatsoever coronaviruses specifically used 115 6-15 year old children test population. used symptom shown household member reason collect nasal throat swabs test respiratory illnesses.

You read right. gave vaccine placebo 115 children used positive tests household members. incredibly unscientific. incredibly flawed study. small sample size methods used make data completely irrelevant.

Trying tie anything involving Covid-19 completely unscientific. found one study flu vaccine whether affected respiratory illnesses hoped worked argument. slightest. Pravtically everywhere else world, put plexi glass customers cashieres. Nah they‚Äôre woke virus respects ignored example above. Factoring $62k deaths flu, stated extra deaths would still $126k. many deaths complications aren‚Äôt factored calculation. Again, people who‚Äôs life expectancy sped due COVID, still way later year. 

So commenter guessed extra deaths would actually much smaller number projecting, sounds like Fauci even alluded to.

Edit: deaths go down, obviously logic flawed. Given constants method recording deaths, would expect numbers decline. haven‚Äôt done much research figures tbh

And clarify, understand Covid-related deaths HIV example. you‚Äôre looking total additional deaths, point moot Another sheep. added sarcasm, thanks Masks don‚Äôt stop SHIT .125 micron Coronavirus. ya‚Äôll keep screaming..... Wow, guess 'great outbreak"" wasnt great afterall! 366,000 people attendance 7 days, without masks social distancing 260 cases across 12 states? Wow! call BS fear-factor narrative! point. you‚Äôre poor pay gas eat really eating first place? Lmao

Might want read carefully kiddo. says measured percentages "" families"" America, ""adults"".

It also goes state findings show majority owning stocks website N95 vs KF94 (Korean standard). KF94 mask also tests CO2 release well, make easier breathe vs. K/N95 masks. Thanks Comrades, we'll pass one! ;) Well fire people try speak so... yeah. He's making reference something Trump said. tried explain was, removed automod political (must've said bad word).  google Trump, Grocery Store, ID find stories it. Mask causes acne scars bad. valid reason exempt wearing mask? Opinions? Yeah, know NY handled well, nyc dense. next months interesting he's presented ever-evolving information updated opinion light new data. district school committee got called exactly that. ‚ÄúYou voted unanimously send kids back school, meeting person instead using Zoom.‚Äù

They meet person. 

It backfire us bit: since conduct meetings open public (required state law) can‚Äôt person (due COVID regs), kept broadcasting via Zoom. much interference (masks muffling voices plus multiple hot mics) almost impossible hear them. 

So feedback was: think virtual schooling better this?

It‚Äôs clusterfuck. Humanity really pretty backward. Can't believe inconsistencies COVID-19. Jail working? Wtf? That's slavery! provides much better explanation. speculative live attenuated vaccines shown provide protection diseases ones developed for. speculated MMR vaccine reduces severity disease prevent person catching disease. believe thinking behind MMR vaccine available safe something consider arsenal fight disease. worn BLM shirt.She wouldnt get arrested then.After protests safe.Keep supporting shit storm homes commiting wrongthink.Brainlets. must hard going daily life stupid. bump head lot? funny early on, even internet's favorite covid doctor warned steroids typically give viral infections.

Yet February got real sick, suspect covid, doctor gave short course cortisone. really helped.

This kind thing reduce fear, dodgy vaccines paid get certified/registered. registered China standard KN95, it‚Äôs done elsewhere it‚Äôs usually N95, they‚Äôre roughly equivalent. 


You could sell mask rated wouldn‚Äôt common use case. know discussing sub systems. Stay topic! Then, never interact again. way save them. give rats ass health impacted die.

Actually, companies take life insurance policy employees, die, they'll get reimbursed cost training onboarding replacement.

They actually plan die. Let one sink in... sort good news? know possible. need balance negativity comments. N95‚Äôs aren‚Äôt short supply more. It‚Äôs really ethical choice letting healthcare workers letting others them. n95‚Äôs vent either. They‚Äôve got new ones. provide url want order American made legit n95‚Äôs. here! They‚Äôre great. make sure they‚Äôre knock offs that‚Äôs pretty easy verify Justice price America. right whole lot lawyers, senior engineers, CSuite Execs, etc working home isolating home. people money pursue wrongful death cases, grocery store workers unskilled blue collar workers ones primary effected right can't work home isolate. things going there? lots infections? Lol good luck someone enforce every room every school. doesn‚Äôt make sense like saying don‚Äôt really need wear mask beginning pandemic, SHTF reversed recommendation.

On hand, afford equip teachers N95 masks? I'm risk, yesterday reading report damage testes. time seen study prevalence long term effects, unique virus. Last year brother got viral pneumonia day blood oxygen levels low. Great news. Fauci President!!

Quick edit, people need stop negative, specially sub. get this, although want sit dark room listening doom metal, cool too.  Don‚Äôt something illegal wrong don‚Äôt worry. complicated. gathering BLM... Wait, early told ""steroids bad"" COVID patients? concept. I‚Äôve NEVER unemployed since first job 14 washing dishes (although could change minute given current circumstances). work ass every day life. real jobs.

Let's see sturgis count catches up. one say sure. time tell. don‚Äôt expect happen personally really wait see happens. Bad excuse, ‚Äúfitting‚Äù literally non-issue. Good question; idea.

Covid airborne except certain situations, surgical mask plus face shield accomplish thing n95 . Disagree. Instead spending hour two getting dressed, filling car, driving work sleep extra hour. still go bed time sleep extra hour great. think see well, chooses ignore them.  Wow, I‚Äôm amazed found thread 3 months later. that‚Äôs truly awful turned family dire situation like that. I‚Äôve never seen food bank that.

Like get people position shitty decision making, plenty people end way spite working hard frugal. even fault, shouldn‚Äôt extend helping hand them? need comprehensive public drug rehabilitation programs position drugs public psychiatric facilities due mental issues. spend much money worthless bullshit, inflated military budget, subsidies multi-billion dollar industries pay employees poorly anyways, mention foreign aid. somehow can‚Äôt find money fix rotting infrastructure social systems? Complete utter nonsense. say that? KN95 masks FDA Emergency Use Authorized, find relative test results [CDC manufacturers show list least legit possibly effective. lot KN95 market claimed able filter least 95%, able verify it.

For example, one max 100% PFE according CDC test, [Arun [Appendix [CDC know without looking up, especially got equipment test effectiveness. Well said. Fauci honest man. trust fn' hate Trump skeptical every move makes.  would interested know know .. makes legend. verbatim facts experience HIV learned Covid, along lines makes legend opinion deep seated love respect him.

What's done elicit response you? words 'reliable' 'Chinese' never put sentence, unless talking rely China completely inept. they‚Äôll taking voter base... probably die, effects could still hurt performance long-term. CDC lost credibility said masks required.

WHO lost credibility said China great job.

Literally med advice agencies lost credibility. they? think handful do. guy something stupid, illegal. bad voted next time around.  Like king, Carl XVI Gustaf /s I‚Äôll crawl broken glass vote ass out.

Anyone watching Wuhan closely start sweating though.  need /u/poem_for_your_sprog this. It‚Äôs probably prevent shortage again, healthcare workers aren‚Äôt without them. n95s first foremost. Yet allow gaiters bandanas face coverings proven ineffective, actually spread thr virus more. N95 without valves safest masks ""regular"" person use, provided fitted worn properly.

why can't ""regular' person use half face respirator? work hospital wear surgical mask nice comfortably. wear n95 mask wear intended need fit-tested make sure cover youre face. wear one without fit tested useless. they're also extremely unpractical wear long amount time someone working healthcare. n95 respirators reserved rooms AGPs, reserved people actually need them. do. prefer herd immunity, costs many lives, vaccine. Plus want lower world population way possible. idea right, basically numbers picked incorrect way inflate final total. 


The real total would also unacceptable, change overall point. Trust consensus /r/COVID19 - Heavily moderated. Scientists/Doctors/ETC. They'll review data rip shreds there's chance worth risk. 

I least.... true mines, viruses don‚Äôt act like mines. takes good concentration make sick all. Case point Ah, Mormons. Gotta luv em vote them, importantly? Yes man. They‚Äôre anymore damnit! think adds fine, teachers teach front room doctors stick fingers yer butt. Ppe one situation necessarily appropriate another. point I'm throwing party someone else's dorm common area calling police.  workout little more. Thats good point. notice Iowa experiencing larger increase immediate neighbors. put two together.

But great plains states get hit derecho also seeing dramatic rises rest US whole. Sad upvote me. hospital staff. said frightened patients allow wear full proper PPE. Fucking ridiculous malicious. That's right kids, get COVID twice, documented medical scientists, patients number countries.

Herd immunity myth. Patient diabetes, hypertension, obese old. See, covid deadly! don‚Äôt think dramatically changes timeline. says they‚Äôll data October best case scenario, would still things get place roll begins. could see early groups getting vaccine December, doesn‚Äôt change fact it‚Äôs going take least 6 months get large portion population vaccinated even emergency approval early manufacturing steps. Tuborg must flow! Lol saying I'm part stop staying home going out

When reality: I'm staying friends social life sub full Debbie Downers predicting gloom doom spreading panic. Give fucking rest, half dozen vaccines already proven highly successful monkeys, first 2 phases human trials. multiple effective vaccines soon. Trillions dollars riding this. put man moon, stakes investments lot lower.

People getting excited (and depressed) nothing though. We've known months vaccine (or vaccines) likely partially effective public health measures continue months maybe years.

Fauci said much last month: end quickly, one different. People need get board long-term social distancing/masking okay increased deaths.

Edit: Also, Americans generally wish miracle cures instead complying public health measures (see: obesity epidemic). Life might change bit -- end world. least choice Well allow people thier first amendment right would never know really thought. get live expect inflammation years afterwards, fun. immune system ok? Six months without leaving home can't good it. safety person Florida? that's issue hand. 

In Florida, burden proof exposure toxic materials illnesses placed employee create link, employer. Look Massachusetts New York, government took stops refused help out. fucking rampant while. difference bw cotton 01, 02, etc ? saw someone panicking Americans never allowed travel I'm like . . . Costa Rica announced they're opening travel 11ish states low infection rates (including Virginia Maryland, kinda surprised me). lot tourist destinations rely Americans pretty heavily expect soon safe, we'll likely see travel return. noticed that. bit little late try take credit. countries capabilities while; administration incredibly late game.

Furthermore, increasing evidence pursue testing efforts early pandemic mostly hitting certain areas, figure common denominator was....

I give credit willing let state suffer without attempting previously. want scientific sub, /r/COVID19 great. It‚Äôs bit dry times, *exactly* want scientific sub. cousin heart problems recently anitbody test sure enough covid antibodies. heart surgery heart damaged. Since DHS know anything infectious diseases? Economic shutdowns, virus, hit women harder It‚Äôs whether wear n95s Wait early told ""steroids bad"" COVID patients? bad PR Smash Mouth. selfish short sided decision play. Exactly, would think conspiracy nuts would protecting coronavirus I‚Äôve seen they‚Äôre ones pushing idea virus hoax. WTF. Fully expected. 

The right wing death cult. intent bringing everyone them. they're absolutely sure kickstart armageddon/apocalypse. It‚Äôs addiction. Treat such.
I would google guides talk subject. gives us insight peoples habits masks though, interesting me. Improper mask usage something see every day still noted voluntary medical study 2009. 

For shows everyone defiant dick wearing using masks incorrectly. new phenomenon came virus political climate. think there's assumption, especially within sub, improper mask usage someone jerk helps dispell little, though original point. site man... don‚Äôt give shit buys.

Said couldn‚Äôt buy them... listed site.

Maybe missed rest post buying aren‚Äôt necessary??? Christ chill Karen antimask article site filed topic heading -- I'm making -- ""authoritarianism"". reason obvious, like last time said need masks. government anticipating MAJOR return COVID fall N95 stock still depleted trying discourage people using stockpile COVID effected them, therefore problem! 

Their mindset fuck everyone something effects directly, everyone drop everything help me. 

Empathy thing people. impossible picture someone else's shoes. talking relative few. first release millions.  


One doesn‚Äôt anything question China‚Äôs motives time. people backed evictions Africans months prior. rich people. Rich people lived campus year. Individuals showed signs so-called dark-triad personality traits ‚Äî narcissism, Machiavellianism psychopathy ‚Äî also likely trivialise risks posed Covid-19 avoid regular hand-washing social distancing. I'm n95s, however think enough people know actually need fit tested worn correctly. issue surgical masks cloth masks. 

While agree telling teachers use n95s, could reason DHS wants teachers stick types masks.


Or kidding probably assholes Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

They'll happy 99% world population dies could live Walking Dead/The Stand fantasies sole survivors.

Since happen time, they'll bunker back basement next virus. whole idea would vaccinate 1 - 2 times year ""ensure protection"". brilliant racket entire global population. can't declare presidency expect anything happen, Michael really multiply optimistic fatality rate 0.5%

Let's factor together

The believed range herd immunity covid believed bet 50-83%

Population | 0.05% fatal | 1% fatal
---|---|----
240M | 1200000 | 2400000
120M (50%) | 600000 | 1200000
199.2M (83%) | 996000 | 1992000

Going HIT (herd immunity threshold), we're looking lowest range 600k 1million covid related admit you‚Äôre taking intentionally weighted, scary numbers, trying pass ‚Äúbest case scenario‚Äù

Never tried pass original set data ""best case scenario"", believe went path herd immunity (give everyone, quickly) lead far additional deaths, outnumber covid direct deaths. hope running time strategy. takes quite generations spread get enough people sick. America, politicians trying cull populations. far left trying self righteous tell far right stupid. far right trying rely God prove miracle smite far left. middle left wondering what's going incapacitated vitriol thrown around them. Wealthy laughing high tower looking down, knowing time come everything fire. Poor currently fire, dying beginning revolt. middle class stuck middle afraid unable stop working unable continue working. truly living end times....The end near, end Neigh.. so? I'm curious mean?  I'm glad smarter people make public health decisions literally disease infested country. think vastly underestimating quickly vaccine put full hold pants production.

Pretty much place used produce vaccine used produce it. Probably making 10M+ doses day nationally. Wowie! great idea! Can't pandemic test one! Shouldn‚Äôt wear mask? not? teacher wants wear one wear one. anyone say otherwise? Lol. attack? 

I think it‚Äôs less day day views virus ravenous need shit news could considered positive. 

Not many around thread, maybe bots got day off... last time DHS doctor? person speaking doctor, listen them. lying making serious mistake kill you. Listen doctors, stupid lying political hacks. simple folks. corticosteroids make ARDS outcomes worse. Dexamethasone, also approved COVID-19, one known beneficial. Yes totally me, reddit think mean Dsa see kind deaths come still ""just flu bro""ing? Nope. arrested inciting civil unrest. video. want keep supply healthcare workers. bullshit.  think mostly seeing effects ECMO (respirator) project recently started [evaluate research long term effects SBU thus evaluate scientific support care, treatment rehabilitation patients long-term symptoms covid-19. interim report containing description project's structure went government 21 August. final report published 1 December. helped hurt.

Hard prove got it. I'm saying I'm saying wont suffocate wear long long moron took mask wasnt required.

Never said anti mask. prefer assume person isnt dumb unless tell are. sure downvoting you. 25 million documented cases vanishingly small number documented reinfections.

Some people going bum immune systems stop reacting properly. 

There's nothing data yet suggests widespread.  there's enough cases widespread we'd seeing evidence it.  everyone age 18-30 caught covid nobody else did, herd immunity would almost certainly achieved number deaths would insignificant. Herd immunity require collateral damage. require cooperation civic responsibility well universal healthcare. working towards teaching career Covid. Observing US treats teachers though, given career plans. do? keep classroom door open keep virus filling room - keep shut case school shooters? Fuck. need wildcat strikes again. union OG sense word.

That's absolutely correct. contracting disease means guarantee. means overall chance dying Covid actually quite bit less 1%. that's unacceptable risk book, fine. Take steps protect yourself. mandate take steps protect shadow. 

Again, someone completely ignoring importance age mortality statistic. Um, seen what's happening Australia compared USA?  York Times hare articles 90% positive tests false positive viruses risk anyone.
So saying NYT fake news.

Oh hello, gaslight much? Go read again.

The US beyond saving, really. have. Lol, Reddit eliminating wrong think, shocking. think misread comment. optimistic - herd immunity strategy even wildly optimistic scenarios results 1M+ deaths. likely death toll herd immunity strategy would result 1.5-2.5M dead.

That's really long complicated answer, unfortunately. subject many variables - I'll best ballpark them, supply chain specific area.

Most mammalian cell culture processes (I assume AZ process, AAV-vector) take 5-8 weeks end end production. large processes/batches higher end. analytics filling/packaging/labelling (2-4 weeks), primary warehouse distributions (1-2 weeks), shipping primary distributor (1 week). idea- go clinics/hospitals/pharmacies? depends specific storage conditions vaccine. vaccine candidates Pfizer Moderna need kept *incredibly* cold (like -80C) complicates things.

Either way, told AstraZeneca today make batch, looking 9-15 weeks earliest could go people. Vaccine batches make anywhere 100k-2M doses experience, effective output could vary wildly based facility size. Again, pure speculation end, I'd bet whatever facility they're using produce would 10-15 production lines, churning batch fast rate-limiting step allows. usually bottleneck first 'recovery' step, process 2 batches per 12ish hours. put together means looking maximum output range 20M-50M doses per week door, I'll put money 35M per week. *massive*.

The virologist Christian Drosten spoke corona virus NDR podcast summer break. thinks today masks, quarantine, immunity rapid tests.

For stimulus figure, many important German voice corona pandemic: Berlin virologist Christian Drosten reaches audience millions podcast ""The Coronavirus Update"" . Tuesday, Drosten reported back Norddeutscher Rundfunk two-month summer break. important statements:


To state research

With regard immediate control coronavirus pandemic, ""not single really new finding"" added past two months. new studies published. would corroborate much already shown preliminary studies summer. impression ""no surprises summer"".

The mask requirement

Drosten described wearing masks infection ""complex issue"". ""the wet pronunciation"", i.e. droplets, intercepted so-called everyday masks, different aerosols spread air. aerosols, crucial infection coronavirus, fine droplets ""that get caught fabric badly fitting mask"". ""This weakness masks clearly there.""

Drosten nevertheless strongly promoted wearing masks two examples. Anyone meets infected person supermarket, example, hit directly aerosol wearing mask. Another example could colleague bad breath. ""That bad breath, that's aerosols."" two colleagues meet without mask, notice bad breath, mask. ""This longer noticing, also translate that: longer get infected quickly.""

Quarantine time
According virologist, quarantine period reduced 14 5 days. proposal, went ""to pain limit epidemiology,"" said Drosten. ""That is, shall say, steep thesis one says five days infectivity actually over."" consideration is: ""What reality de facto lockdown?"", explained. ""It's use kinds school classes, kinds workplaces quarantine weeks."" Drosten also suggested five days ""wasted"" tests, rather end test test whether affected infected still infectious.



The cases secondary infections

""This attention-grabbing,"" said Drosten study carried extensive public relations work Hong Kong world's first proven re-infection corona virus . cases ""rarities"". ""At moment difficult say many patients affect,"" said Drosten re-infection. Epidemiologically, however, probably consequence spread virus. ""That describe medical reality normal case."" case mean vaccination work.

Despite cases described, Drosten even ""confident"" people survived Covid 19 disease protected recurrence - least period current pandemic. exceptional cases, renewed contact virus could lead new, superficial infection, result severe pneumonia. Due lower virus concentration cases, chains infection longer develop.

Rapid tests

""That busy summer me,"" said chief virologist Berlin Charit√©. ""I two weeks vacation."" work break broadcasting was, among things, rapid tests could made possible quickly. easy impression sometimes given. ""There big regulatory process behind this, whole thing lawful."" lot practical background work done summer, important autumn. Woosh Good. Sooner we're back normal better doubt referencing mask thing early on. 

For cripe‚Äôs sakes, early on. Subsequent research proved transmission frequently droplet / aeresol even properly-made cloth mask right material could help. amended recommendation admitted wrong.

You know gigantic Lincoln memorial DC? Lincoln also wrong, one occasion, national crisis killed unprecedented number Americans, crisis also largely brought upon ourselves. 

Still, built statues him. current office-holder sworn office hand Lincoln‚Äôs Bible.

So, yes. Good great men err. still deserve recognition, even commemorative statues. 

Especially provide gallant, tireless, steadfast leadership formidable national crises widespread loss American lives.

Dr. Fauci‚Äôs hero times. people attended Stugis rally 100,000 people, without masks already biased give shit virus. fact got tested suggested they‚Äôre sick much greater risk death someone hypochondriac.

In comparison, Trump‚Äôs Tulsa rally 5200 people multiple deaths among Trump‚Äôs staff. curious. story, House speaker always outspoken mandating masks, wearing one haircut, absent know what? turns things alone makes quality living situation long run really like way used ‚Äúherd-resistance‚Äù beginning there. think much useful term describe may going outright ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù Difficult know why, possible answers include:

1. ""Superspreaders"" may essential workers, care workers, etc. could people partying, etc. - different groups get protection super-spreading situations;
2. Spain went super-lockdown almost none quickly. such, people may thinking whether particular action safe context - things went ""walking around block dangerous"" ""hit disco"" almost overnight;
3. Reinfections might still possible, possibly milder cases could still cause transmission;
4. Even 10% immune, 90% aren't; assuming immune population would likely pass Covid without wider population, R(t) would 2, 1.8: decisive get effective transmission values 1.1 - otherwise still get exponential growth, slowly. We've presumably time set in. downward trend isn‚Äôt real... people get right? nice read teacher (thankfully US) wear mask time ü§ûüèª
So I'll keep fingers crossed... Actually - super, salary isnt deducted. get 15% top pay. dont get access age 65. Haha corona hoax. people paid actors /s Agree. storm appartment arrest front children? March probably many times infections reported, everyone get tested. Dick. Yeah ‚ÄúCOVID actually isn‚Äôt bad‚Äù claims surely backed countless medical studies, right? need banned spreading false information keeps interrupting policeman, calmly tried exlain situation. cuff used pedagogical tool here. extent tax money used always discussion. right wrong almost always concession extremes work. Maybe would better shut honestly society good protester filmed it. better way handling situation like this, stormig someone house, handcuffing crying pregnant woman front children. what, posting event Facebook. turns zombie starts eating people around though. Survivors may end suing you. Guy clearly doesn‚Äôt realize risky US vaccine strategy is. vaccine play counting technology never worked providing successful human vaccine. cause vote left, doesn‚Äôt mean can‚Äôt ignorant ideas pandemic. You‚Äôve minimized death count saying things like ‚Äúpeople die tons causes every year‚Äù. yeah, fuck it, don‚Äôt try stop dying? Yeah Oh ok makes sense.. mean media isn‚Äôt reporting fact mass protests happening pandemic. example media flipping shit trump rally maybe 500 people (and rightfully so) comes protests everyone acts like COVID isn‚Äôt thing anymore. sure hell want flu scarred lungs. Alright thanks. agree disagree point. many people need help right now. enough. go public testing positive need criminally prosecuted. 

Those seek testing symptomatic don‚Äôt quarantine get test results, go public criminally prosecuted. 

Those break quarantine, whether awaiting test results tested positive, criminally prosecuted. idea, really care. trust government think issues community spread. second wave Korea Vietnam show quickly get hand become problem again... see evidence Taiwan. I've going baseball games packed 10k people months now, traveled around entire country vacation going night markets, etc see zero evidence community spread. costs $150nt (like $5usd) visit emergency room, community spread people getting sick, hospitals would slammed, aren't. stupid all.

We pretty much are. Lot morons traveled Bulgaria beaches wear masks. 

Or Mallorca...

Or 

Bunch idiots. Yeah hummm, need clear history cache report something data for. contact tracers could find information out, national plan. cruise ships would seem another example unfiltered central HVAC resulted super spreader obese friends   friend nurse 27, tested positive symptoms maybe mild headache. 3 months ago, curious took would still test positive. would also like know immune catch Ok, ""asymptomatic people spread virus"", even that's true (which isn't), PREsymptomatic Asymptomatic people present SAME. know pre- a- symptomatic.

Probably wife something article doesn‚Äôt mention mask wearing curious EU locked hard, unfortunately it‚Äôs citizens careless americans Hey, that's idea! Fine scofflaws, give cut tipsters. expecting clickbait, actually enjoyed points article made. Subtle distinctions kind help improve messaging. study also coronavirus all.

It using novel low lost technique measure water droplet dispersion various mask types.

No study provide sorts conclusions data transmission SARS-CoV-2.

But yes, ""another nail coffin anti maskers""! Even though, literally, even drop evidence study support claim. automated.

1. It‚Äôs right thing do. poor completely destroyed? middle class suffer greatly? rich (I‚Äôm talking people $50 million) barely even affected pay it? think manage one less unused vacation mansion. 

2. rich great deal taken wealth since mid 1900s. Three people top hold wealth half people country. Wages kept productivity gains top 1% pocketed gains. taxes lowered well. 

3. Many calling it. Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Abigail Disney, many others calling taxes top. would thought less access good medical care systematically marginalized would affected? system works fine first world European countries. He‚Äôs moved threatening us riots Corey Booker. üôÑ  spoiled/entitled crybabies. coronavirus outbreak shuts school less-contagious flu chance spread. China same; want see first come complications.

What hell on? China actually [testing volunteers, high-risk staff within much Covid-19... people Australia bother social-distancing, going places large numbers, wearing face-masks, still flying people (or around) finding getting infected soon after.

Sad thing is, people think ahead realise jobs went due businesses shutting necessary lockdowns, unemployment would go up.

We officially recession now. Well done, everyone.

DOWNVOTERS: Take another deep look yourself. know true, want admit it.

I've wearing face masks properly every day since early March Qld, social-distancing properly too. thought others would follow lead... starting they're still rare sight.

Maybe body failing earlier life actually made easier come terms risk pandemic? seems like older people lot trouble that. Reportedly, real numbers collated yet well...it's India. Leave Fauci, ONLY! Trump, Biden, politicians get damn way! am! ? Thanks reminding much hate nomenclature virus. miss called 2019-nCoV. hell syndrome name virus? Obviously reply going refer 2020 travel restrictions due coronavirus. 

In 2019 [United States passport holders could access 184 countries without visa, applying one arrival easy-to-use 2020 *in absence coronavirus border travel restrictions* Americans permitted (with without visas) 185 countries. Australians permitted travel 183 countries (with without visas). [This level access means Americans equal sixth, Australians equal eighth world ‚Äòfreedom travel‚Äô overseas despite permitted travel places Australians - Americans significantly less passport holders proportion population (even inflated statistics include non-citizen foreign greencard holders). - Australians share land borders nations could passport holders purely day-to-day work purposes like Americans American greencard holders transit international borders daily work USA, Mexico Canada. 

Additionally, even closest popular travel destinations Australias (Indonesia New Zealand) take, average, 4-8 hours direct flight time (ie, longer LAX JFK HNL ANC), whilst *direct* flight time (ie, capital cities typically east coast Australia) popular destinations takes much longer (China Japan - 8-12 hours, USA LAX - 11-14 hours, UK Perth - 18 hours, South Africa Perth - 14 hours, USA HNL - 8-10 hours, direct flights parts Europe, must transit Middle East USA first). 

The continent Australia almost large size lower 48 United States. takes long fly LAX JFK Perth lower west coast Brisbane upper east coast. takes long fly LAX Sea-Tac fly Hobart, southernmost state, Brisbane, hour bottom northernmost state (still 2200 miles top state, direct flights comparison). 

That population smaller irrelevant. 14x larger population served equivalently larger air route map, direct flights destinations reason. Yet proportionately Australians passports, travel.

Therefore, reasons Americans travel beyond borders lack time available so, and, frequently, lack money. 

(Should also say - I‚Äôm geographer [not ‚Äòmaps flags‚Äô kind, geographer less] one daughters pilot national airline, Qantas. flies international route due small industry here, can‚Äôt say could easily used establish identity Reddit cares that!). really surprising, guess really hoping either moderna, Pfizer works. wait see happens october. realize right VAST majority infections US came Europe?

Sorry, exactly designated mask break? Like, outdoors just, get time regular day remove mask? People saying 6% deaths due COVID COVID positive patients underlying conditions, per CDC report. Thus care COVID?  might want check facts.

First, I'm one used tRump, criticize ""I did"". Though, full disclosure, use T-rump occasion avoid overzealous censor bots sub reddits. preference, necessity sometimes, adds single character typing makes sense putting dash elsewhere word.

Second, criticize poster, though criticize Trump using childish insults. Despite fact still one using childish insults, even were, world difference expected decorum random poster Reddit President United States speaking capacity office representative nation.

Third, little funny name calling trigger segment population idolizes worst offender. might want think - might come uncomfortable understanding true hypocrite (hint: me). get started bloody politics! We'd way fucked now, that's sure. Good idea. think look raw CDC data see obesity definitely increases mortality risk, pales comparison age serious conditions. would travel Labor Day vacation pandemic. Especially plane. heard comment yes man Dr. Birx lately? see Denmark's average daily cases going up, Sweden's going down. Seems like Denmark's bit controlled burn Sweden's actually looking keep cases dropping. Yes understood 6% current deaths. 6% overall morbidity. Fauci Makes Blunt: 190,000 Americans Would Still Alive *tRump administration.* like analogy. makes wonder though, exactly death ""only due to"" Covid-19 look like? 6% exist reporting issues?

Again, incomplete numbers ""today"" 270k 115% deaths value ""today"" likely counting complete. Quote actual 253k+ comfortable extrapolation.

What say this. Korea China traumatized epidemics hit countries hard recently (ie: MERs Korea). Koreans tend highly educated, higher trust government transparent citizens regards issues, culture generally wears masks (due really bad air quality). things help big time. lot Western people seem think Asia well collectivism aspect honestly, terms Korea, example, spent ton time money developing pandemic response team years. mention, Japan probably conformist/collectivist bunch, think Japan handled things quite poorly somewhat dishonest figures (due hosting Olympics). about?

I'm Costco employee, one frequent NY employees wearing N95 style masks (not obviously). Lots people belong prison days. literally taking account people's thoughts feelings could ask for? 

Don't tell people worry virus take back another moment thought, exactly ""should"" worried contracting it? 

#BECAUSE SPREADS WITHOUT SYMPTOMS Sounds like Meniere's disease, described far sudden attack vertigo. hearing often sound like broken speaker? That's sign, often certain frequencies really muddy cracky sounding.

My girlfriend diagnosed long time ago. Basically layman's terms, inner ear produces much fluid. Gives vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss.

She's able control really well, though recently attack one nearly 10 years probably due stress. avoids salt, limits caffeine, although coffee morning tolerates it. Would definitely discuss ENT, although believe need diagnose actual attack.

IMO LT wrong path: must trace test much every C19 patient, fast can. Spain wearing mask, staying home weeks like other, yeah, todo lo importante. Except tracers testers, quite expensive. Mi opinion.

I think people try dismiss inconvenient certain political candidates disingenuously claim people take seriously acting like world ending.

Anyone supporting strategy immediately relegated nutjob pile rejects, instead administration become trusted source ‚Äúscientific‚Äù knowledge. thought case February. Ever since seems every time anyone white house speaks reinforces idea wanting us die.

Except Dr. Fauci. man hero. Hit clearly gave selective memory. 

He issues many statements matter since then. article completely wrong facts. memo ban N95 masks, discourages use without proper training fit correctly. Also, study citing meant convey effectiveness mask type. study proving technique measuring efficacy. studied bunch masks, ran single test each. results seen remotely conclusive.  called r/coronavirus peeps negative Nancys got...upvotes?  Looks like tide turning around sub, maybe there‚Äôs hope us yet! Neither things benefited situation. giving benefit doubt government situations earn it.

They knew virus months first time, anything prepare, get enough masks places, therm confiscated masks states, even higher numbers cases. Now, they've done little prepare masks AGAIN. Telling people wear masks never guarantee healthcare workers enough. goal effective methods.

They said quarantine would weeks despite taking strong enough steps, enforcing it, kept people going businesses. People still panicked hoarded items. happened repeatedly one knew government would do. went advice every economist. went logic. benefit country.

Neither choice made benefit us. like that, conservatives believed evolution. Teachers notorious Democratic voters, administration trying use virus hurt political opponents beginning. stage. inclined believe US government deliberately wants cull population. *soar* eh? 

30% increase low, close zero, *soaring*

According CDC, obesity underlying condition. 40% americans qualify obese (BMI 30), seen photos crowds Sturgis I'm willing bet crowd underlying condition puts greater risk.

Concerts best Thanks upvote, kind stranger! problem. _lot_ possible long term negative effects. stage 3 trials rarely rushed. Exceptions may occur IFR consequences higher possible side effects (e.g. 50% infected people die, vaccine worst case going kill paralyze small %, might get approved early). problem is, would never accepted American culture.

China never shut whole country, shut hard hit area HARD. Nobody in, nobody out. shut NYC, everyone would go Baltimore, etc. nobody would accept full quarantine. Clearly Litigate... Cool, wants guinea pig? Wonder got from.. Banning teachers

I think DHS authority masks teacher wear unless there's still shortages N95. Yep, Confirmation bias strong virus really hope vaccinated end year. Here's problem. live NJ know 27 people 5 deaths including elderly aunt friend's 53 yo brother pre-existing conditions. saw wide range recovery friends, varying overweight 60 yo high blood pressure, said mild, nothing it, 55 yo, much healthier paper, said way think flu, sick still side effects, weeks later. daughter ICU nurse Newark NJ saw months COVID COVID deaths. (They National Guard helping them.) also drove NYC saw refrigerated trailers bodies them. know real, well. 

If go experience, real. part member society someone reads thinks information presented clear hit Italy potentially bad. need personally experience see that. Dr Fauci CDC came recommendations aligned countries doing, read seemed work, started staying home masking infrequent times went state locked down.  Yes advise changed time, yes people made mistakes, certainly saw enough suffering death - none course compared daughter. 

My father polio iron lung year. Hardly doctors practicing seen polio. took vaccine gave children despite that.

This can't personal experience. science. 

Or quote friend, what's difference virus terrorist? argue terrorist glad it. Germany cash register staff seen grocery stores wear masks behind plexiglass walls, much choice. stay minutes wear KN95 FFP2 mask also provide protection me. would prefer also wear mask aerosols. Pay $12,000 year insurance me, wife, two kids.

Still leave hospital visits owing $3k $4k two separate visits, insurance covered maybe $2k combined.

ONe trip ER, got charged $2,000 get 1-2 IV bags 2 hours dehydrated massive vomiting. Another trip ER, charged $500-$600 tell rest up, cough fine.

Pay $800-$1000 dental work.

Daughter cavity, still pay $200ish pocket mainly said insurance cover something help ease pain procedure(it liquid supposedly help knock way). daughter said even anything.

Why paying $12k cover basically nothing?

The free yearly visits, can't even bring anythng anymore. tried say starting knee pain physical, doctor quick look knees, decided needs x-ray, got charged office visit looked knee 20 seconds. Ridiculous. felt risk low county visited fewer 800 COVID-19 cases, compared 33,000 cases Philadelphia. Regardless, understand frustration,‚Äù Kenney tweeted Monday.

This problem. understand. Unless venue test accurately, know asymptomatic breathing air you, turn, breathing in.

Korea's Starbucks super spreader event illustrates this. Yes, covid-free, thing. countries like mine (Austria) open bars social events, often sort contact tracing. condition something like stable, effective health care system, yes, regions pretty close normal. can‚Äôt fair, place live ‚Äúpoorly‚Äù social distancing/make thing numbers still pretty low. relatively low amount we‚Äôre seeing due efforts. Same. I'm planning go international music festival late May. I'm realist, know might happen, part still holding hope. can't serious statement upvoted assume edited harsh reply moderate comment. I'm confused. Supposedly US government paid manufacture like 400 million doses vaccine (which enough whole population) 3-4% population able get first? understand might take 400 million doses made 3-4% seems low. feels like enough risk essential people get PLUS anyone wants it. know everyone general public willing get beginning. Super anxious see play non-essential worker non at-risk person, still REALLY want vaccine ASAP get life back. mention time took deploy simple things like masks gloves hospitals front line workers.

We 6 months testing still fucked bottlenecked.

I faith vaccine distribution happening quickly efficiently. 100% correct. He's completely over-correcting. Anyone disagrees, trying prescribe caution, guess gets called degenerate. 

He basically invented type person head, decided that's boogieman moment, prescribed stereotype ""redditors"" general, walks thinking made amazing point somehow means anything all.

And comment got upvoted, too. That's wild. hours luncheon thing bosses birthday Friday? kind gatherings take place warehouse. There‚Äôs probably 20-30 people going. I‚Äôm comfortable going. would do? think many people afraid many care. Plus subreddit isn‚Äôt average person, it‚Äôs echo chamber. subreddit represented average person probably would gotten control virus US April 100-150k fewer deaths right now. know. courts take forever violence streets. Yes. Operation Warp Speed. They're hoping produce 300 million doses.  literally impossible sort parties. small get-togethers people distance wear masks. larger parties people drink (no mask), smoke (no mask), inebriated, likely keep masks disregard distancing. I've gone underground parties/ raves half life point absolutely sickens people still throwing parties exactly what's happening (adding harder drugs mix definitely help people act carefully). personally trust Oxford vaccine. potential Moderna Pfizer vaccines current administration trying push presidential election people understandably wary effectiveness.   Maybe stereotypical mindset bikers figured bikers mostly preferred music like MotorHead Black Label Society. I'd figured would scoffed Smash Mouth, pandemic no. actually tickets concert April I‚Äôm really hoping able go to. So, fingers crossed Let's face it. one talking 2 months ago. are. Bad publicity still publicity. lot would good population, nobody likes listen Sweden take along time shut UKs prime minister didnt bother taking seriously till it. Theres masks see point. military came said would get involved dispute winner election, settled congress courts.

As be. militarily backed succession battle last thing need. Sorry agree disagree safety likely. Effective? Agree disagree top know mean. I‚Äôve seen people bragging leaving house since March letting kids play outside. healthy. disastrous prepare vaccine distribution? What? Idk man phleb plasma donor center witnessed pcs2 centrifuge lid/bowl pop really seem like aerosolated blood mist happens. Lol. never sure reddit. Half people joking redditors might say, half unironically believes say. 

A good one too! good two good measure. saying willing Country WHATEVER takes provide workers rights parental leave sick leave universal healthcare developed nations successfully done. 

If workers rights healthcare everyone going ""bad"" economy, something fundamentally wrong system needs completely re-built ground up. tell like take day without fear losing job. 

It's time Country gets act together.

Also, sure downvoted why. hope watching SmashMouth live worth dying for. Operation Warp Speed hoping 300 million doses safe/effective vaccine early 2021. anything coming data Pfizer Moderna vaccines? thought entered phase 3. get pay 25th every month, Friday 25th Saturday Sunday. (Sweden)  Again, also OSHA requirements contend well. I'm guessing ""scary"" thing. bring up. Time strike. 130,000 excess unnecessary Covid deaths prepare Trump life prison directly done make pandemic worse. could restricted sales, bought masks themselves. feel bad situation. dumb things increases ambiguity US media best world maximizing profitability ambiguity. love hate Trump. Nobody ever spoken vaguely dumbed things more.

Fauci Trump like Yin Yang ambiguity. Fauci always trying minimize Trump always trying maximize it. pretty predictable outcome that

1) Trump going take credit vaccine

2) Trump dovetail saying proof he's date science scientists (they said would take years, thanks leadership months, etc.)

3) Trump supporters use grounds they're correct climate change hoax

4) It'll used grounds delaying response climate change rest administration cement supporters it

Which lead millions unnecessary deaths. 

Thus, there's pretty strong case made vaccine coming December vs. October going save lives vaccine ever could. died loves. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs pleased decision go way. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è That's happens Congress cahoots Presidency. never hit high enough rate infected achieve herd immunity Spanish flu.

Nah, means I'm infuriated flagrant stupidity. Like ostrich head ground. dog house fire using previous examples absolutely nothing determination made career staff FDA - president.

EVERY SINGLE EXAMPLE SAYS BULLSHIT, INCLUDING WHATS COMING HEAD FDA'S GOD DAMN MOUTH. Maybe say louder get vaccine even data front incredibly dangerous - lead hesitancy put people's lives risk.

Holy fuck. worms opened time around ""It go away like miracle."" politicized, fucking months. can't close worms.

This can't introduce flagrant corruption entire fucking federal government. putting lives risk. already killed 180k+ sitting saying ""Warning corruption government dangerous! might get someone killed!"" No, clearly need keep spending roughly 700 billion dollars military. There's way spare single cent totally-not-overinflated military budget help pandemic that's already killed 200k people. 

/s Hey hey hey let's fair here.

It's ""only"" 65 years.

But yes, literally every part incident we're dealing here. seems super selfish way around. Taking away freedoms specific segment population though seems shady, almost fascist like. also think average age wrong. believe say 80% fatalities Covid 65 age group. standards means think 20% deaths acceptable. 

Even disturbing though fact perspective shows find better important anyone could die. also shows think everyone else give freedoms sake - don‚Äôt restrictions. pretty fucking sad die COVID. see Smash Mouth listed death certificate cause death. think deploy National Guard, Corps Engineers etc. set massive drive-through vaccination stations. Similar news people work picking food boxes. designate spots let people book day/time range. Let cars line up, drive family everyone gets shot. realize obviously really complicated actually this, think makes sense. Republican Party - guilty charged. Yes ticket window resizing. Four days later snowballed ""its can't use Windows, get Mac?"" paper trail let dept head pay non-standard equipment. go route, somehow ""IT providing tools job"" scenario could ""here 12 emails covering case, seems like matter preference. want process $2200 team budget?"" ends true- serves us right. parties fun (or fun) at. Try less obsolete quip. die? surprised, good they're catching cases relatively quickly saliva tests. suprise suprise ... realize going live virus vaccine, right?

And basing fears virus going pushed unsafely based science experts, rather, incident 65 years ago resulted less 1/1000 vaccinations resulting complications *completely different type vaccine*?

That's... something. That's nicest thing say. take reasonable explanation living rules wants place us. left two real choices. Either dumb (highly likely) knows big threat. choose. Also insist mandatory firearms training severance. Sadly, wrong pretty obvious look media sub perceives Cuomo vs. DeSantis. Cuomo‚Äôs response led state worst hit place **the world**, economy shambles, people fleeing. top this, state still hasn‚Äôt transparent data.

On hand, Florida hit hard, even close NY. It‚Äôs clear media sub upset fact, since wanted Florida get hit hard since March, rejoiced cases spiked. odds, Florida essentially beat virus, now, DeSantis isn‚Äôt praised media, doesn‚Äôt get late-night segments testing swabs nose, sub unironically call Ron DeathSentance, even though state 20,000 less deaths NY. it‚Äôs letter next name. got worried moment cuz thought reading title wrong.

""This can't right, I'm reading right, stroke? what?""

Then read article. omg think so? years ago I‚Äôm good species names could right! 

Another interesting thing, something works counter argument original comment (which find depressing) is:

There 2 species tied near tied closest living relatives human species. Chimpanzees, brutal recorded eating members rival tribes multiple times (both gross gruesome) bonobos, peaceful species. won‚Äôt find bonobos American zoos settle every potential dispute sex. Even something small gets play new toy zoo exhibit first. American zoos don‚Äôt find family friendly. thought psychopathy born with, sociopathy nurtured Roll tide Give 14 days That‚Äôs true n95 mask then. sub compromised. echo chamber paranoia fear. way months anyone disagrees wilfully blind  Exactly. sick people thinking Sweden herd immunity strategy, sick people thinking herd immunity strategy works, Swedish strategy moment works. People listen country's experts. Swedish strategy made experts country, politicians. neuroradiologist without qualifications infectious disease! political mouthpiece sell-out traitor profession physician.  Disgusting. using previous examples *absolutely nothing* determination made career staff FDA - president. 

Politicizing vaccine even data front incredibly dangerous - lead hesitancy put people's lives risk.

Also, cut personal attacks. resort means nothing left.

Edit: phase 3 trials formally conclude another two years, patients continue monitored. one suggesting wait long efficacy data. happens winter?  they're 'rona race - good luck! live dumbest times.  universities basically pulling bate switch. made unrealistic promises open safely rarely implemented necessary protocols. cases keep going up, get send students home (potentially refund deadlines) wag fingers high might students everyone knew going to. Students already made tremendous sacrifices academically, financially, socially disease barely\* impact personally.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*probably  Think misreading comment here.

We reasonably assume outside safer inside. reasonably assume small/no groups better big groups.

In cold weather places, easier socialize outdoors summer. warm weather places, easier socialize outdoors winter. Hopefully simplified things you. troll account. Goes around shitting people deletes comments. ignore him; he's used it. Every time hear people talk masks, think medical accessory - leg cast, elbow brace, wrist strap, one 1 leg wheely things. 

It's perfect analogy, pretty good. I've worked lot states dont know public school system didnt union. shamed continuing fear Sorry that‚Äôs BS excuse used entire mess started. didn‚Äôt want general public wearing masks one reasons why. 

Educators goddamn front line deserve much protection possible. putting mask labeled N95. properly use N95 masks involves fit-testing ensure proper seals. masks designed create tight seal around mouth nose ensuring anything breathed gets filtered though mask. 

The purpose general populations masks protect others possibly infected droplets.  Yep, feel way 1st arrival vaccine, work major hospital requires vaccines like flu. happens try force take feel comfortable it. matter ""pushes"" it.
The vaccine come major company, like trump scientists trump tower working vaccine. Yeah probably. don‚Äôt know cultural differences us South Korea, think aren‚Äôt well prepared pandemic here. 

Just two cents: think focusing ""authoritarian vs democratic"" values makes much sense, reason authoritarian handle crisis way, see pretty harsh differences democracies.

Instead, I'd argue ""hive mind vs individualism"" cultural aspects made stark difference overall better factor. Countries influenced Confucianism values (China, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore somewhat) handled crisis much better compared ultra individualist US.  Honestly, articles like good wake call. want die COVID? Masks social distancing enough: exercise, going sunlight, eating healthy important things well.

To day I'm still shocked see obese people wearing face masks...and entering McDonald...they simply get it, they? Unions illegal Texas. extremely weak unions people go around saying unions illegal. sociopathic qualities live culture, let's cut chase - people *fucking stupid*. Trump raided FEMA funds send $300 unemployment weeks. Right start natural disaster season. pandemic. Yeah I'm pretty skeptical claim. either rogue manager OP understand told Check local department health. Alaska test turnaround time posted Alaska department health website every day. Currently around 3 days. I've working home business ten years now. used thing - work anytime/all time - force step away days. sleep shit reasons covid, working home. forced back work.

At gunpoint? forced? know sometimes chain pharmacies places insurance cover, good luck rare low stock stuff independent pharmacy near hospital. one go order know keep coming, compounding, sometimes ""mix up"" normal stuff hard get. that's....not objective.. right protest essential democracy track every food additive/preservative/medication etc. consume verify scientifically safe consume? Everyone become vaccine expert nowadays meanwhile consume variety chemicals really idea daily, simply trust systems put place. sure changes now.. Listen. I‚Äôm continuing school.

As aside, reiterating worst case scenario. ran thought counter rather silly arguments small group Melbourne doctors claimed using rather misleading statistics. Yup. different telling welder can't use helmet. reckless endangerment best considering SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme‚Äâ2, expressed pancreatic Œ≤-cells and, given circumstances case, suggest SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19, might negatively affect pancreatic function, perhaps direct cytolytic effects virus Œ≤-cells. 

Although antibodies beta cells present T1DM, destruction cells also caused production reactive oxygen species, due excessive activation transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB). activation also causes reduced expression, reduced sensitivity, antibody blockade receptors used pathogens enter cells, case ACE-2 receptor. prolonged, receptor downregulation also contributes cell death.

The NF-kB driven immune response activated pathogens establish long term latency inside cells, SARS-CoV-19 biggest failure setting [testing early CDC took forever develop test distribute states. first test kits sent mostly defective. FDA dragged feet approving labs hospitals universities.

You're subjected unsafe working conditions. 

Or could did, say religious beliefs include right wear N95. love things good world, please cut corners making vaccine!!! Haha rounded up. Honestly though, I've said many times past - ideal time trusted public engagement group put place regulatory bodies. focussing basics would go long way educating public, alleviating anxiety combating spread misinformation. still shortages anticipated. things actually harder get states emergency action provide PPE healthcare facilities stopped programs.

Edit: suppose clarify, good reason prevent people access wearing them. saying shortages longer issue inaccurate. people around unsafe saying numbers fake cause anger stress. Yes, goal reach herd immunity, likely vaccine. ‚Äúopen economy‚Äù (I‚Äôm even sure mean that) allow 70% get infected, math many deaths would be.

Masks required entry formality

At 2:30 ambulance cart someone molly/ketamine/god knows else drug cocktail, cops basically left us alone continue party. 

One officer even said ""The masks stop much"" Anyone else notice chart showing evidence suggests you‚Äôre better wearing mask fleece mask? Ya figure put little box pillow night, Guarantee Fairy might come leave quarter, right? One thing say- old banked samples earlier 2019 need screened. They've already used old flu tests january US confirm covid circulating US well first diagnosed case occurred, looked flu respiratory illness. odd way virus seems impact people leads believe portion population seen virus like recently, portion hasn't, susceptible now. several conditions put high risk covid, extremely mild case. get really ill last november though traveling Seattle. Idk...there much understand yet, really hope epidemiologist somewhere putting things together [pepe style. Fauci say sure protests lead increase coronavirus cases..but clearly say something bad want get banned sub well.. use anger vote?  November, good go Thanksgiving!

(/s) That's interesting. Thanks!  people looking log charts misinterpretating linear suspish timing.... schools allowing grade school kids use classroom else go parents work. school 4 kids daughter‚Äôs class going every day also built sort plastic castle teacher stand students behind plastic. get parents choice person schooling done outside central air used school seeing evidence spreads virus.

Let‚Äôs honest here, ton people don‚Äôt follow guidelines think one looking, remove mask lower noses. husbands work great example this. Rules state employees must wear mask company property times lunch eaten outside. also temp checks throughout day infrared cameras. mean took seriously. Meanwhile office employees take masks offices 3 4 people per office wearing them. spread floor since air recycled onto offices. It‚Äôs bullshit. going happen everywhere, even schools. virus play rules though.

Melbourne almost finished toughest (6 week) lockdown Australia, daily infections dropped 750 currently 70. 99% people much sympathy tinfoil want prove point time. Spend 4 straight months year mostly dark probably sociopath too. Bunga bunga!! dont want overwhelm hospitals. Plus need meds vaccine help. Plus theorized herd immunity may already happening wearing mask prevents full viral load, instead get small dose still develop antibodies it, meaning herd immunity might already happening noses Yup. I'm wearing KN95s school hill hopefully literally die due covid-19. news, someone shot leg surprised started bleed. also surprised started dying chose put pressure wound seek medical care treaded freedom. pulmo got couple vials dexamethasone syringes several months ago one nurses teach give shot. Obviously home ideal situation, potential whole lot ideal stuff coming pipe. time elections. Thats load bullshit ask me. makes sense stupidly look tests per pop.

You must look tests per size outbreak done best Tests/pos. case test positivity rate. studies still blinded (i.e. one knows got vaccine placebo) data yet. think idea discussed unblind study people enrolled point see data shows vaccine safe effective.  

The problem going smaller number people anticipated looking relatively short amount time, make difficult prove effectiveness. Even either shown effective know effective amount time people study unblinded (2-3 months). Without really knowing long vaccine effective could end lot people get assume immune going forward fact may could cause another whole host problems.  

Of course administer millions doses people across country able collect huge amount data vaccines characterize safety efficacy. worst case scenario would ended effective anticipated, lot public may become skeptical future vaccines actually work. 

source: work pharma clinical research That's dad calls ;-) That's slightly fast. Would Nov. 4th well? Well I'll wait. I'm hungry anyway... it. I'm school district north GB area school district wearing KN95(China) Mendards. probably thinking N95 go medical personal (PPE), also sends wrong messages ineffective loved ones important.

And knew could get trump 2020 face mask.... political president making political;

Yes, ""president"" raging narcissistic sociopath, argument holds up.  theory fit-testing Best Practices, case study mass spreader event Korean Starbucks shows N95's (and KF94's) work even they're fitted. Sure teachers donning respirators going covid ward teach want make sure properly sealed faces. Ah, meant 200K month ago. Got it. Coronavirus kept good shape. mass testing? demand only? it‚Äôs demand imagine pretty high percentage symptomatic know concierge doctor performing coronavirus tests $400 pop could even really get one California. I've reason believe vaccine diverted premium channels. I'm sure whole bunch people pay vaccine look downvotes post getting? people afraid confronting issue covid BLM? 

Covid-19 natural disaster care politics. reason someone cannot support BLM social movement, condemning BLM spreading covid. Sorry, edited comment OCD kept check. Meanwhile, another part sub... guys calm down? don‚Äôt like Trump administration either you‚Äôve following three candidates would know good news. people live NY, really weird thing going upstate get hit NYC got hit super hard, state implemented safety measures response NYC applied whole state. cities people generally good wearing masks whole time.

what lead really feel like Covid-19 hit yet many people know afraid school reopenings going lead first wave. know fear wave fall. SINGLE EXAMPLE SAYS BULLSHIT, INCLUDING WHATS COMING HEAD FDA'S GOD DAMN MOUTH

The FDA never said would approve vaccine without efficacy data. wait trial officially end enough data issue EUA. timeline data determined infection rate, remains quite high.

The decision vaccine made Dr. Peter Marks team - controlled career appointees. Trump pressure Hahn wants. going make difference.

I never said Trump corrupt.  Remindme! December 31. Kinda crazy US going end worse death rate them. Sweden really shut anything :| exactly that! that's basically going enable us get high-risk healthcare workers immunized veyr quickly, enough stockpiled get *everyone* vaccinated Christmas.

And I've said I'll say again, get high-risk healthcare workers vaccinated, systems standpoint, pandemic going pose threat. Nick Saban would disagree. couple weeks ago, daughter talking pandemic mess, said, ""Why people...?"" stopped there. laughed, that's go-to see stupid shit happening. Just, ""why people?"" help save environment. Air travel, least, significant factor. whole schtick guy argue herd immunity cases go say things like knew would happen. 

And say hey look economy? 

There's longterm strategy. he's lucky governors rein enough get wants always trivialize covid say deadly begin with.

Like Trump, survival influence depends 100% influence. Florida pretty much screwed. stayed home he‚Äôd alive ride another day. hope Florida knows Canadians coming year. picture President HRC almost completely faded. that's left bit pantsuit. Asking source ""not buying"" claim. request information. You‚Äôre talking country people don‚Äôt refrigerators, bank accounts healthcare system didn‚Äôt prepare. countries like Peru, countries like Vietnam proper lockdown coordinated government response life back normal. Didn‚Äôt hear? OSHA took year off. Yes Schools going shut time. least could provide maximum protection teachers. That's cool. We're still waiting smoking gun either hypothesis.  Great point. I'll definitely seek alternative resources needed. 
It's kind wild though. marked decrease availability always common drug past six months so. There's lot theories floating around due used covid patients. According FDA limited supply chain issues resolved soon sounds like case. least case long people still catching virus becoming critically ill. Based literature messaging thus far, I'd put maybe *touch* sooner, think that's pretty good assessment nonetheless.

It also depends mean ""early spring."" I'm Chicago, early spring like... mid-April. I'm guessing we'll sufficient quantities anyone wants vaccination get one March-ish, maybe late February EUA comes October 23rd. [So here's document explaining difference N95 respirator (what districts discouraging) ""surgical mask"" (what looks like ""normal"" mask).

Can someone explain exactly difference is? would anyone want Probably one world would use either, part Americans. article clickbait.... young person, would rather disease 1 100,000 deathrate disease 0.7 100,000 deathrate?

You use common core skills evaluate one preferred. Found sociopath would say definitely closing point going unless absolutely unwise, reckless, combination two. wedding next June. normal April normal wedding probably cry whole wedding week happiness. point, I'm thinking taking IRF money saving move different country better healthcare FOREVER. Fuck U.S. think lab origin hypothesis. 

I think comes nature. bury it. doesn‚Äôt love irony? Yeah rushing vaccine can't possibly issues. not. DHHS federal govt. 

Wisconsins DHS run Democrat. maybe contact Andrea palm curious branch DHS getting lax. We're probably 10% across country now. vaccine medical staff November December. Another 5% probably get infected then.

That's 25% new year's, one knows herd immunity percentage really needs be. Could much control couple months. doesn‚Äôt total end, many people getting tested India? able test million day yet no? applaud making okay 5-6 million americans die. hope family among 5-6 millions number. certainly need people like kind heroes. Heavy herd, light immunity strategy.  ashamed myself? showed COVID-19 fact feared. one who's saying nothing worry about. 

If anything, one committing moral crime denying deadliness COVID-19. trust fauci. here‚Äôs hoping true safety us. stay safe DHS wants play human sacrifice teachers. simply sick &amp; twisted point. They're betting enough public see teachers expendable, ""move on"" lives. Damn, youngest 9 years old already changing config files shit games plays. Computer literacy important reading, writing, changing tires, reading maps. Sorry! ‚Äúoafs‚Äù directed dim-witted ilk, you. Look peri- myocarditis, result even asymptomatic infection. papers stating large proportion survivors (~30% even more) these. That‚Äôs kind highlighting democracy can‚Äôt help us need new people top democracy mean yeah, simplest solution theory would move, life funny way making things complicated. I‚Äôve built life am, house, family close by, love students. could take everything live put state colleagues actual rights, would. since can‚Äôt that, next best solution campaign positive change within community. ability speak school board without possibility immediate professional repercussions, isn‚Äôt possible Don‚Äôt use facts here. Well, Trump fucked pandemic response, snd cops dying.

Is short enough follow? first paragraph author compares prefer herd immunity strategy anti-vaxxers. Yet, almost infectious disease expert, any, recommended strategy without vaccine. So, start author lumps public health experts anti-vaxxers. high-quality info, we've set bar terribly low. 

Further, repost article Apr 29th. Anything earlier next year soon me, even going consider election. 100% trust Fauci like rest you. tried hard that's counts. Part programming unreasonable combative. Finally. Someone making sense here. Canada, hospitals aren‚Äôt even using N95 routine care COVID patients; aerosol generating procedures. Procedural masks work fine general care. 

Half thread straight people outraged conception risk management COVID actually believed transmitted. FL July much August. Rushing vaccine political purposes, bypassing proper phase 3 human impact testing, wrong. I‚Äôm taking it. people wanna guinea pigs untested, go right start lining up. preponderance scientists credentials relative field approve it, absolutely. Teachers taught front room long time now. teacher know, anyway. teach kindergarten standing front room lecturing? shortage thing again. They're making stupid mistake telling people N95s intended proper, like said surgical masks weren't. conserving health care providers. Interesting mention anxiety. super anxious back March/April/May live northeast that‚Äôs bad here. actually stopped worrying much summer (while still careful). Normally don‚Äôt even think keep circle pretty small, last weekend visited couple friends hadn‚Äôt seen awhile. think it‚Äôs adding bit unknown causing little anxious. Must suicides people literally never given shit mental health issues probably called anyone ""snowflake"" suddenly really, really concerned reopen local gyms movie theaters ASAP regardless local area doing*

*I downplaying mental health issues exacerbated various levels shutdowns, calling hypocrisy ""BUT MENTAL HEALTH!"" crowd using real issues buzzwords push ""open everything I'm mildly inconvenienced anymore"" agendas. know ones. really care mental health never have, want disingenuously pretend get lives back status quo continue giving shit anybody else's health, mental otherwise. agree, I'm willing take proven safe proven effective yet. I'm healthcare likely opportunity. said comment. focus people demanding n95 thinking make safer surgical masks. case cause often improperly worn. I'm sure place post goes.
My sister suddenly came high fever today. We've coughing showing sign respiratory symptoms, we're Vietnam new confirmed cases since days back. wanted ask: ""Are case respiratory symptoms?"" looked online find concrete evidence. I'm getting tested tommorow make sure, anyone provide reliable information source this, great would still good news. Norovirus couple years ago fucking *brutal*. Couldn‚Äôt keep liquids food, high fever days end, body aches, chills, nearly go hospital dehydrated delirious. Lasted nearly week straight don‚Äôt remember days middle.  medical worker, concern mine. even choice here? easily see employers firing us take drug, especially areas union representation. decided feel push, put much time research it, already feel like going settle well us whole. How?  Take head slam brick wall 20-30 times. 

It easier actually trying factual conversation cult member  administrators?

How highly paid deans provosts bear responsibility instead trying blame students everything. administrators ones decided continue semester doc folk know ( know maybe 10 so?) low key while. realize makes waiting vaccine completely useless right. realistic create administer billions vaccines every 4 months. Reminds bosses work Europe here. watched Cuomo's daily briefings. team everything right context West. implemented everything possibly could beat back virus. even briefly forced private hospitals behave like State wide unified health service. cleaned disinfected subway known fomites major cause spread. infection rate fell implemented world class re-opening vigilant testing tracing program still maintaining low rates. rest America looks like basket case comparison continuing death rate demonstrates. 

Cuomo managed whilst getting help Trump importantly keeping citizens honestly informed therefore onside. Frankly better job country interest politics affect me. assume attacks management crisis politically motivated though. 

I think America edge collapse someone competent Cuomo attacked. America unable get act together anymore rapidly becoming driven political cult feelings rather science rationality - malaise maintained theocracies middle east state permanent medieval squalor. Wake America losing mojo. gone landing man moon failed society half century. doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll give scientists credit. vaccine success despite administration‚Äôs war science, it. Make sure properly fitted. lot places repirators stock likely fit smell test kits too. Yep, crime widespread N95s 8 months this. 

If continues another year, say without vaccine reason, we'll eventually require people wear N95s indoors they're PPE designed protect wearer. We're requiring gross incompetence government able procure them.  every country losing tourism revenue? lol... Im also welcome call bullshit see We're need script anti-vaxxers, too. different flavors. Stopped right word, modify trial parameter placebo group also receives vaccine. Nobody going stop trials already arranged paying for, continue monitor participants least 2 years. Trump take credit. actually want know propaganda piece read in? facebook post forwarded grandmother?  Yes no. 

If COVID 19 there's chance exposed it, higher sneezed coughed.  

It ""stick"" weed smell however. Guess league used part profits fund development rapid 15 minute coronavirus test?

Here is: Yea accidentally touched something using time machine? Probably Kyle. God dammit Kyle. Seriously. roommate shared something 9000 people dying covid whatever bullshit Instagram morning I‚Äôve seriously shaking since saw it. feel powerless infuriates health safety someone else‚Äôs hands. absolutely 0 deaths linked protests/riots/lootings? Trump friends consistently lying masks since February 2020. They've killed lot people   welcome follow. literally millions prisoners certainly test First. give challenge trials like not. Chinese vaccine likely relatively safe I'm sure huge ethical cost relatively safe impression military academies keeping students isolated weeks starting classes. think important factor dynamic obstinacy vs. recommendations culture live in. huge push masks Sweden - even areas world clear message ""masks save lives"" see people taking stand it.

I think America higher rate sociopaths, think American culture allows sociopaths act freely. could wrong here, would assume someone in, say, Iceland, refuses adhere national health standards going far ostracized someone US, especially live Republican heavy region. news cycle, exact. Yeah. mean must originated place found closest known relative. John need born location closest known relative.

RaTG13 related, closest found, gather, still pretty far away covid. ought closer relatives there, elsewhere.  didnt take long.. cant say im surprised. Exactly. mistrust thread undeserved rather trivial topic. Administration vaccine hold process... trying streamline get jab, what's it. Imagine shock. political human nature tho. mean use politics made worst overall we're hardwired. something backed Donald Trump, best scientists world. United States FDA best scientists planet. American FDA approved use convalescent plasma potential promising COVID‚Äì19 Treatment. simply wrong say ""Trump-based plasma therapy"". ""**American**-backed plasma therapy"", since FDA American institution. sounds like anti-mask arguments spring. 

Even improperly worn N95s good surgical mask. tried link source got whole comment deleted purely p0litic4l. Search contract Philips Navarro negotiated, ensuing ProPublica investigation, contract cancellation. extremely horrible psychotic/depressive reaction low dose steroids last year. updated advance directive I'd rather dead steroids (unless entirely unconscious guess, sure that's option). I'm taking every precaution, I'm scared. Florida. New York March. Seems like article right. least one else died yet. Everybody stay tf home Christ‚Äôs sake get you‚Äôre saying, goes ways. People shouldn‚Äôt making judgements persons mental fortitude can‚Äôt handle extended isolation, also shouldn‚Äôt suggesting people *can* handle aren‚Äôt mentally stable.

I've going bandit, using high threadcount bandanas that're doubled go nose chest. strong blow makes hand feel little warm seconds, I'd like something thicker too. would be! Given fatality rate demographic less 1/10,000, little 1,000 cases likely hospitalizations point. Barry Bonds entered chat.... Look every developed country took pandemic seriously. sharply reduced numbers new infections deaths distancing protocols mask wearing way safely reopening. Countries like US Brazil screwed around downplayed virus facing thousands deaths day. Put damn mask enjoy life **safely** lot quicker say every man himself. Sweden herd immunity strategy, stop spreading myth. experts Sweden saying masks help, think important focus improving social distancing moment. Unlike countries, spread still decreasing (since march), seen need impose measures. believe better save cases start rise again, specific areas situations happens. likely going recommend masks becomes relevant. make anti-maskers, world black white. Yes, said harmful **if overestimate masks practice less social distancing exchange**. would get Phase 3 trial data made public review independent scientists preferably approval country like Canada Germany. different countries purchasing different vaccines, latter may hard. 

I approval EUA trial data complete reviewed, since pretty clear point FDA's EUA process completely whim politicians.  epic concert drinking money going come contributing grandmas funeral? hope I'm going keep wheezing hard stack boxes job might come back. never saw anyone condemning BLM protests one somehow worse.

Edit: wonder antibody tests out, people think avoid uncomfortable swab test find if/when get symptoms. Im really excited next months ATX students back. point, what's couple extra months amongst friends? January March better summer, 2022. Especially given logistics required make everything happen (finish trials, distribution, etc.), month two within margin error. convenient - another Federal agency become political weapon Trump.

2) Goggles

3) Face shield

4) drinking, eating

5) ( OPTIONAL, want less skin exposed ) Latex gloves

5) Clothes get washed soon possible

That's weird way saying fine killing everyone 70 advancements treatment thankfully, I'm sure there's advancements stopping spread. Masks sure help, best way avoid spread limit social contact.

That's screen go doctor's office, genius. Well it's... sorta true? point sending home cause bunch innocent people get infected Give months be, death tragedy. 1-190k Florida entered chat probably would close same. think? Time fight covid get ripped time plenty Germans mess too. Brought ‚Äúclose two weeks‚Äù brigade. They‚Äôre LYING. They‚Äôve lying, could back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù wasn‚Äôt vaccine promises. planning long term mitigation since day 1 lies curve flattening overly optimistic vaccine predictions caused us miss entire year lives. Huh thought linked stupidity I've saying since march, corticosteroids positive effects covid-19 patients. health inspectors good well defined parameters. Blanket business closures bad they‚Äôre arbitrary back plan. back plan. back offering us?  Chinese Russian vaccine?. ""back up,""

Added ""Opting in"". Makes political statement also. think doesn't. political statement ""opting in"" worst nations world say humanitarian work around world. about. want teachers strike? kind mixed message bullshit exactly going make teachers quit walk demand better safety guidelines. would blame them. gladly pay much $15 per dose get vaccine year rather potentially 2022?

The whole concept paying disgusting, long we're going full capitalistic USA health crisis, earth would $15? First couple months $5000 per dose, $1000 people covered. Drop couple hundred dollars months that, on.

That way get make disgusting piles cash ensuring ""the right people"" get first.

I mean system do? bus station train station Wuhan.

It remove mountain valley. old people living place, could undetected years. Depends area, places hit hard enough vaccine distribution early probably R0 well 1, really risk people continue quarantining.

Mask wearing continue course think could largely lessen restrictions January. What. people don‚Äôt care.. think percentage low really don‚Äôt care Right red cross antibody tests free donate blood. Obviously donate feeling well heart/other problems. healthy want know great thing do. Plus get free cookies already starting. talking points ""all vaccines bad"", ""it's way soon know vaccine effective can't rush reasons."" Yikes, thats pretty shitty plan. Sweden's 576 deaths per million people. slightly worse USA's 572 deaths per million people. 

Though US current rate probably overtake Sweden Friday Monday latest.

Main point Sweden (which went herd immunity strategy) USA virtually identical deaths per million week. Yes, exactly! already know FDA issued EUA convalescent plasma, even though evidence efficacy (even NIH said so: release distribution documents, almost guaranteed FDA issue EUAs October meeting regardless early trial results. Trump wants photo op vaccine administration election, regardless whether vaccines actually work. Americans can't trusted budget accordingly get money once. People think they're reasonably protected start getting together again. 50% population really priority category, odds are, hold on, lemme math... 50% also priority category.

Or misreading claim? ive keep eye studies reviews long time. 

The good

Many many studies phase 3 stopped early positive outcomes high negative outcomes adverse events low became unethical go forward phase 3. Giving anyone placebo worse treatment unethical. getting market unethical. overwhelming clinical data yes approve .under normal days would see meetings, paperwork, hearings, public comments, billing codes, pricing information, manufacture public disclosures paperwork, announcement etc. end stuff easily 2 to5 months. point cutting red tape save lives . Billing, authorizations, cost, filings, etc cause major issues road.

The bad

Congress neutering fda since 2011 2012. fda heads done questionable things money pocket. far drugs approved shouldnt didnt really work opposed drugs dangerous approved. wont see lawsuits cost system high.

The ugly

The vaccines could market even sooner. need volunteers meet criteria. High risk, healthy people, areas affected rising rates. new york may good vaccines werent ready upswing. leaves states remained open opened early. Ones tend high antivaxxer mask slackers. . Ones wont go vaccines. Plus ton people home. arent risk.  people want restaurant's, bars , schools open would signed vaccine, would probably enough data get approved october high risk (elderly, immunocomp, etc).

They additional ugly. vaccines problem arent talking about. Storage. vaccines required stored temperatures way lower vaccines. Negative 94 F such. think moderna Negative 4, bad. next major problem distribution. I‚Äôm sorry! sounds stressful right now. hope hospital ready, even coworkers obtuse. Depending possible vaccine, countries might ordered big amounts aswell. time distributed evenly Sorry, could clarify distinction burnout threshold HIT?

Elsewhere (including post) expanded early call HIT. I'm skeptical (more likely, think, might threshold beyond caseload growth still possible hospitalization/severe illness/death much minimal).

To expand little further. I'm taking herd immunity mean sterilizing immunity, e.g. ceiling many people become *infected* virus causes tail towards elimination.

If 10-20% population sterilizing protection (i.e. antibodies captured accurately test), likely enough described.

Beyond 10-20% testing positive antibodies, additional immune protection likely least *some* portion. Contenders cited cross-reactive T-cells (intuitive, fairly speculative point) T-cell memory specific SARS-CoV-2 remains even defeating COVID-19 antibodies fade generating antibodies (not 100% confirmed less speculative Door #1).

Getting population point 10-20% table entirely infections big chunk remaining 80-90% T-cell protection *should* bring paradigm virus tougher time spreading (far fewer symptomatic cases, path-of-least-resistance transmission) positive cases, extent they're still found, visibly detach hospitalization/death trendlines.

This course speculative, lifting restrictions early cause second spike land higher rate overall infection even locked early epidemic

I agree, even mentioning initial think that's strong enough evidence say that, places spread virus continuing yet start, masks distancing dropped.

At time, best available fit evidence. We're point behavioral interventions lousy fit evidence comes appears population-wide burnout *as primary driver* though there's certainly strong case keep worst damage bay along journey peak.

I thought article linked great share agree we're talking full-on, sterilizing herd immunity, 43% reasonable threshold. I've also seen cited approvingly Carl Bergstrom, *acutely* anti-take-this-lightly, tweet 40% might reasonable lower bound respiratory illness probably (but he'd happy wrong since means journey ahead easier).

But, thing point could purple line end worse end lift restrictions quickly.

Assuming mean Figure 1, matches pretty soundly way rolling lockdowns first proposed.

If go back 15 states picked random, actually see exact pattern couple them. Missouri comes mind (and, lesser extent, Minnesota). surprising - means interventions holding back dam, speak, see (gradual, like y=x^8) uptick they're eased.

However: see anything resembling purple line state past 15-20% infected range. (Yes, checked all.)

For that, I'm looking particular Gu's lower charts estimate new total infections. New deaths little better since real-world evidence, we're looking lot low-population states, peaks chart might seem due time-lagged reporting.

Here states *do* show ""double hump"" infections ala purple line link, along date ""hump 2"" began climb estimated total infected:

WA: June 10, 3.6% infected  
IA: June 15, 4.1%  
MO: June 1, 2.2%  
VA (faint second hump): June 10, 4.7%  
WI (faint first hump): June 1, 2.3%  
NC (faint first hump): May 21, 1.8%

So tells purple line real possibility states virus run course much. hand, take NJ surpassed 15% April seen anything resembling climb back up.

To discount population-wide immunity causing burnout, believe either that:  
(A) Interventions NJ level April (They aren't.)  
(B) Interventions easing, ease much version March/April peak come back. (NJ made far. fair say ""could be"" we're consistent, revisit expectations restrictions ease nothing grows control. possible say ""could be"" end time.)  
(C) Interventions easing, easing thus far already caused virus grow control, we're seeing yet. Well, clock's ticking one, seems dubious all.

And, look, know NJ could defy expectations next week become first state form tangible ""second hump"" despite prevalence ~= 20%. right now, we're seeing that, right now, pattern best available explanation real-world results. mom got asprin $100. Thank you! really appreciate it! Unfortunately I‚Äôm sure handle it, I‚Äôll think it. really don‚Äôt understand students parents expect schools do? Tell faculty getting 50% salary reduction even still teaching amount classes working hard virtual format? 

Fire advisors, registrars, financial aid counselors, people, various staff don‚Äôt process paperwork, graduation application, admission applications, FAFSA, whatever next year get discount? Everyone wear Mask. Hong Kong others left us rear. Country Bad. America supposed first, LAST everything. I‚Äôd even settle clear, consistent message. page instead arguing masks people like would feel comfortable engaging economic activities. Since can‚Äôt trust that, severely limited participation economy pretty much curbside groceries occasional take meal (provided restaurant provides way get delivered outside minimal/no contact) Yeah, I‚Äôm SD people know who‚Äôve gotten (2) young healthy *was* flu. felt like shit short breath, ‚Äúneed hospital, even really medical care‚Äù bad. reason went doc get confirmation testing. 

People aren‚Äôt really dying result one taking seriously. made pretty simple understand.... missed ""skimming"" part. I'm you, still think might good. listen research proves points (of none really does). 6 months still going....  it‚Äôs mass hysteria.  now?  last flu season killed 170k Americans?  Life Stockholm pretty normal since around May. There's lot forest raves open airs season spent much time older family normally would though. I'm Northeastern Iowa. Midwest gets right now. Please explain fraud? Yes, would benefit economic impact offsets potential harm. They'll Ford Pinto population. No, argument; observation. 

There's point arguing somebody believes Covid created lizard people steal gold away lair earth's bottom-face, I'm sure agree. 

Likewise, there's point arguing economics somebody refused capacity make economic arguments. see many examples throughout sub; personal attacks, emotional appeals, appeals authority, etc. didn‚Äôt see anywhere links sent. Care specific pint information is. Wha... funding critical services order line pockets politicians negative repercussions?? 

*insert shocked Pikachu meme here* could ground zero be.. insane people dismiss lab leak completely. Fauci person trust tbh gave examples government, private businesses telling wear. 

And, btw, businesses get shut public health reasons time. That's breach freedom. health inspectors bans selling alcohol children something? really. lot states really large initial outbreak feared. problem acted like first wave almost completely reopened everything right away. least A-Rod still safe early studies seem indicate would able even achieve herd immunity virus

We've never able achieve herd immunity virus naturally; vaccine always required. 

Hell, even vaccines, respiratory viruses still notoriously difficult eliminate. Look ""Spanish"" Flu, still making rounds 100 years first appeared. can't spread fast enough infect everyone time, bounces around, mutating inside everyone getting around herd immunity changing much every year. 

Natural herd immunity achievable. 

It's astounding anyone thinks valid strategy. Norwegians Danes travel parts Europe skiing much Swedes do.  Yeah, buy either. Inject rich first, eat them. nothing else talk Bernie communist never job 40 honeymoon Russia 1980‚Äôs fuckung Cold War nuts done here. ran Dr Fauci lawn bowling tournament last Wednesday said still huge threat. Oh I'm saying Trump fuck up. He's done terrible, one disbanded pandemic agency (don't remember official name). that, recall correctly, known decades ready full blown pandemic. reasoning that? one demanding goes gulag. shit poor leadership. Citing general quality politicians emphasises point: low expectations. incredible. vaccine team working SARS MERS vaccine research knowledgeable coronaviruses, develop candidate shows great promise phase 1 2 trials undergoing phase 3 trials somehow scam artists? 

Its insane highlights frightened groups may go back normal precedent massive second wave happened without large first wave part world Spanish Flu. live world similar one made Spanish Flu disaster, COVID affect population Spanish Flu. Yeah I'm dumb understand half posts. know that's point, they're supposed avoid coming sweeping generalizations I'm still like ""is good bad?""  Kind of. mean dying Covid bad death, even took selfish risk. :-/  Blame fucking POTUS this.

Or ""politics"" countries ""manage"" pandemic provide measures lockdown.

Your orange dyed stupid fuck selfish POTUS shit.

Lock fucker less people die. true without agenda. Stop witch hunt BS. 

Reality always fight dig crap find nuggets truth. adult. Interesting research many nuances definitively say nothing stop spread like Duke study said. I'm doctor epidemiologist, pieced together, beyond fitted valveless N95, next consideration seems make biggest difference material, since designs fit similar N95. 

The reason gaiters shitty protection covid almost always made super stretchy polyester blend. material literally designed keep air flowing keep wearer cool, stretched, even compromises ability block anything out. That's end story though...

Surgical masks use polypropylene filter particles, get surgical mask fits well, that's great option. bunch retail masks polypropylene layer well, want look bit better, find one that. 

After that, cotton non-stretchy cotton blends seems reliable. readily available cheaper, long fits, good go. Even cutting t-shirt, long dangling open like bandana (which REALLY nothing), decant makeshift solution. numerous studies saw say cotton especially effective doubled up. 

So, got 100% cotton gaiters. basically tubed t-shirt material. put 1 on, could still see little, doubled up. can't see all, sticks mouth inhale deeply, I'd say trust fit safety bunch masks I've tried since April. 

Obviously I'm dude Reddit, piece together info materials designs safest, think find gaiters shitty protection design, rather material often associated them! shreds say... read trials might cancelled approval given, ethical issue unblinding placebo participants vaccine market. Biden far moderate taste, actually. would preferred Bernie. Social Democracy actually solves ton problems, probably people want to. want live fascist, perhaps could fuck North Korea Russia. Sweden ""better"" numbers US, managed without strict lockdowns,

One thing ban gatherings 50 people. would probably good America well. Yeah tbh think ""fear mongering"" non-existent science predictions exact, giving estimate fear mongering. crazy amount people worried corona healthy amount perspective important give. 1000 people dying per day virtually one talking worried it. Almost 200k dead, deadly enough people concerned? saw lil lady matching crochet mask purse combo. got distinct feeling ignorant purposely rebellious. Yeah, work. Surgeon General said, ""Only N95 masks work - buy them!"" guess people did? never guess. try.

Or could said - know masks best, everyone buy simple disposable surgical mask like almost every Asian country did. consumer 'surgical' masks even ASTM rated would likely inappropriate healthcare setting anyways.

But no, messaging acted like masks surgical, N95, cloth. Ignoring ASTM rating, N99 N100 instance, KN95 (most approved), etc. 100% it. reject good news comes election nothing good happen might make look good like whole thing isn‚Äôt irrecoverable disaster they‚Äôve told is. Blame fucking POTUS this.

Or ""politics"" countries ""manage"" pandemic provide measures lockdown.

Lock fucker less people die. Good environment, can't say good mental health Hell yeah told sticking needle leg good. Okay, we‚Äôre page. Made seem like got flu shot. referring aerosols, significant part transmission. biggest culprit, respiratory particles, blocked effectively both. problem either 95 surgical mask wearing something protect eyes exposes viruses back throat. educational setting, concentration aerosolized particles area lower, surgical mask absolutely fine. Blow I'm curious, someone please explain vaccine possible COVID common cold ? Thanks lot. Halleujah!!! Another factor course time many infected virus mutated quite bit re-infecting people. Also, people gotten covid twice already. ‚ÄúWrong‚Äù subjective, it‚Äôs certainly short sighted best.

Every person went Sturgis made choice put entire community back home risk. There‚Äôs nothing funny that. Yeah almost one things together! 

/s Lol shit kills me. would stand decent chance maintaining power

I hate tell you, stands really good chance maintaining power anyway.

The presidential election decided means, potential taking control senate much worse odds taking presidency. That‚Äôs exactly I‚Äôm trying say. hundreds millions people take vaccine every year, must people got flu years took vaccine. Haha see? Joking! Ironic funny ""just trolling"" also agree message serious

Your orange dyed stupid fuck selfish POTUS shit.

Lock fucker less people die. They're driving more, speeding more. Like crazy. actually commercials Michigan telling people slow down. careful, stuff like gets deleted. Can't anyone using science nobody alive study science Based I've observed, Fauci tended make conservative, nearly worst-case predictions. scientist should, suppose; good scientists speak decisively subject unless reasonably certain they're correct it. 

For example, vaccine. Throughout crisis, he's maintained COULD see vaccine much faster expected, he's moved prediction several times situation developed. able find good source Google there's ridiculous volume news vaccine time I'm looking old one, [here's late July mentions original conservative prediction reports predicted vaccine approved FDA well 2021.

And [updated moved forward time Anthony Fauci said Friday remains confident coronavirus vaccine ready early next year

And article today, seems actually predicting vaccine end 2020. Something he's touched ""possible"", never predicted. 

In light this, opinion, possible (maybe even likely) we'll end getting maybe well end year, reason suspect estimate also highly conservative nature. in, perhaps oft-lamented November (election) timeline could actually produce legitimate result.  States districts want poach great teachers, would good time recruitment reasonable scenarios, &amp; reciprocity. is, anyone funds education anymore. would bet all-stars could looking way district. Unfortunately mechanics salary scales &amp; retirement (is going still thing?) make movement difficult teachers 5+ years experience, unlike industries. might chance. real total likely higher account impact overwhelming medical infrastructure. early studies seem indicate would able even achieve herd immunity virus. lots pointless death. infectious disease would predominantly affect boomers... say phase 3 would concluded say (to me) indication big outdoor events probably unlikely spread covid everyone attended. American, born raised, yes!

 profit dudes top. Nothing little guys, crumbs middle whole damn kitchen anyone making $500k+.

I'd leave but, can't even anymore! Uggghhhhh!! country upside parties. people think sone kind fake thing it‚Äôs Covid fucking serious new novel disease decades away stopping agree wearing mask dumb gets. vote I‚Äôll garbed like Marty Mcfly full face respirator way I‚Äôm trusting post office polling stations safe think going bleach booth pen every voter nope. ‚ÄúThe viral particles get lungs, damage lungs probably happening,‚Äù said Hardy.

People higher viral loads may also shed whole viruses, makes contagious, compounding danger spreading disease widely.‚Äù

These points worth considering. makes huge compounding difference.

But regardless, whether odds encountering virus reduced degradation dispersal, effect, dispersal happens faster. OK buddy, one force basement. Yes thankyou  use leeches. Department Homeland Security said that? like anti-sex politicians get caught prostitutes anti-gay politicians hang truck stops.

On one level, rank hypocrisy, corruption grown even malignant power they've attained. another level, sad pitiful self-loathing, convince everyone else lecherous are, still virtue punishing others. oh quoted approach personal thoughts it, remember spot projected tell people worry getting it? Makes perfect sense understand motivation.
Teachers highly unionized majority liberal group. 
Trump's DHS counting covid spread suppress votes depends whether virus democratic virus republican virus. Determining political leaning virus potential become new field genetic study.

Someone Facebook posted pictures old co-worker mine crowded wedding reception. Yikes! New York Times hare articles 90% positive tests false positive viruses risk anyone. 

So saying NYT fake news. US, Spain, hard-hit countries. push much money manpower something want, certain speed go at.

Vaccine testing takes years, rightfully so.

The thing extra manpower money achieving many different ones going exist. ways could sped would require ignoring medical ethics. amount people still insist ‚Äúit‚Äôs new virus!

But, NY place look at, global pandemic. re-introductions lockdowns varying degrees, Lipsitch predicted - especially NZ, Vietnam, South Korea early ""clear winners"".

Source prediction: give obvious argument support side. R0 (unaddressed / original) somewhere around 2.5 3.5, due physical distancing, masks lockdowns, brought R around 1.5 (widely varies location) even lower, [mandatory masks cause asymptomatic building towards herd immunity low medical costs.

Secondly, positive side, _too many_ decent treatments / interventions diagnosed early access medical care early. 2 dozen drugs work varying degrees, even super cheap ones like Ivermectin. bulk treatment apart primary medication Vitamins C, D, K, Zinc standard medications pneumonia / lungs. really need afraid COVID such. 

Coming back side argument - However, many ""ifs"" - time diagnosis, unknown existing conditions, availability good health care, costs, long term effects central nervous system, heart, lungs, etc. herd immunity, forget people ventured months, large number. immunity go believing herd immunity reached, complacent could get infected.

In case, make mistake confusing _herd immunity_ _personal protection_ COVID. get infected - _and get vaccine thing body_ - face risk spending time medical care paying hopsital bills. risk acceptable, unavoidable (employment, poverty, essential worker, whatever reasons), can't help it. 

Therefore, _complacency_ opinion-based (not peer-reviewed scientific papers) declaration ""herd immunity"" good idea. disease permanent unless eradicate vaccines.

I hope Dr. Last right, go _without precautions_ based that.

Edit: even [formal paper published math estimate 43% says estimates interpreted illustration population heterogeneity affects herd immunity rather exact value even best estimate. OP‚Äôs comment, checked post history. long interval posts, still.



It‚Äôs full misinformation.

But claim inevitable denier talking point. reopen/why bother mask going get anyway.‚Äù


Such fatalism isn‚Äôt accurate helpful

Edited hopefully it‚Äôs obvious I‚Äôm talking sherbert. mean countries hit hard early massive spread society anyone Europe even knew going on? Or...don‚Äôt throw parties spread disease people give loved ones? It‚Äôs really simple.

If people putting danger, that‚Äôs one thing, people could infect don‚Äôt get say. they're saying way vaccine everyone gets sick. way term used means many people possible get sick. talking China America tear gassing, shooting disappearing citizens exercise right protest. 

This someone breaking law, calmly placed arrest community made fully aware happens break law protest even happens.

We call de-escalation. tactic used democratic countries around world.

We protest lot Australia. global pandemic selfish stupid, also breaks laws put place protect larger society. basically non-event us he's remote

I really hope trend continues expands. That's surely convenient specific choice graph. Let's see tests conducted Spain different.

With said, wish even testing done. Sadly cases continue rise every institution overwelmed see graph, even tho pasted without commenting. 
Different countries hit differently, even taken similar approaches. people never evolved past simian stage. one screaming yes help slowing spread virus. still strike organize ""staycation""? ""I'm strike, im taking necessary time health."" Dont go college worried college parties. really simple Voluntary interaction isn‚Äôt taking point. It‚Äôs mora thing do. lead example. Don‚Äôt advocate something without willingly first. 

You also haven‚Äôt addressed would done. Something like doesn‚Äôt happen night. can‚Äôt keep printing money. understand basics monetary policy? CGTN international arm state broadcaster China. Think RT VOA. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad. I‚Äôm scared,‚Äù said woman refer Angela

Me too, Angela. Almost time ;_; [they think I'll keep wearing P100 What's point? virus EVERYWHERE Healthcare environments.  one anti vaxxer. pro vaccine proven safe effective. problem Covid disruptive society need vaccine ASAP. I‚Äôm little worried could political pressure FDA approved rushed vaccine Trump foaming mouth get things normalcy. 

If Fauci says things good anxieties calmed little. trust him. vaccine he's talking Oxford one, there's agenda vaccine even American made used elections no, cannot ""both sides"" response US.

President Obama left behind Pandemic Response team. job, probably figure was. Trump's team (I think el mustacho John Bolton) disbanded it.

If Trump done basics, NY Governor Cuomo managed (despite federal government side, resources federal government), things would different now, least southern states.

basics like, believe science listen scientists medical professionals, shut downs reopening based upon certain measurable criteria, etc.

This sides, Trump owns lack coordinated federal response, whole lot unnecessary deaths economic fallout. 

If Germany, heed advice, stay away Russian sponsored TV personalities candidates. Bruh I'm talking excess deaths, cause death (which 6% claim grossly misinterprets). Unless think happen 189k deaths usual far year reason all. Nevada one Hawaii‚Äôs league checked that. cherry picking, literally one look at.

But want take go leagues, look California, next league tourism. Similar size mobility change Florida, also seeing pretty large outbreak. look Texas, less shutdown Florida, pretty bad outbreak Thank Trump one. It‚Äôs life, get choose. Let Kirk wants. medical experts don‚Äôt even know severity yet. It‚Äôs opinion, I‚Äôm sure people aren‚Äôt going go ‚Äúoh Kirk cousins said it‚Äôs ok.‚Äù people think someone high school education like Lebron knows something US constitution. Ok, wrong! bad, thought stay home order started earlier. Think it‚Äôs based state county, vague honestly Definitely. year virus could completely eradicated still hangers-on around sub chastising people planning vacation going concert. Means six percent doctors filled death certificate wrong, better ten percent March Doctors frontline healthcare workers face highest risks, well highest risk complications due exposed higher viral loads.

They widely agreed upon necessary 1st recipients Weird, someone also works Costco banned store.. Well likely hypothesis, since know 6000 people died covid.

*With.* crucial point keep ignoring think either need glasses, else calculate exact numbers instead relying visual

2019 stand you? Wow. numbers dropping steadily 1990 2019, nothing strange 2019 drop.

Anyone looks honestly see never drop like 2019 many bumps corresponding size previous year's bump. That's need show spillover deaths 2019.

You're disingenuous waste time. I'm out. related remdesivir, ""the main component"", approved use, anywhere. (You Google understand prodrug is.) There's indication anyone giving remdesivir cats; they're giving illegal GS-441524 China. Remdesivir already known treatment COVID-19, GS-441524 humans barely studied far. Yeah exactly right letter: use may regulated OSHA. district covering butts liability regulatory standpoint.

I'm side teachers, welcome wonderful world regulatory compliance. logic reason cast aside face making sure follow law. district met person. half think ""scamdemic""  *injects bleach. ""by blocking even virus-carrying droplets inhale, reduce risk falling seriously ill COVID-19""

""The virus get body, sick likely work healthcare admin, similar ""rules"" wear cloth masks.  thats disrespectful WWII Yeah well fine. dick move anything. actually, thoughtful person go work. comment might (barely) merit, surviving 93% mention *all* barely case sniffles, even miss day work. that's case, goal beginning overrun hospitals, happens run kinds problems. preexisting health condition mean die take place member 7%, means body fight harder. People dont wear masks literally day. They're generally taken home. masks would worn 8 10 hours day. isnt suffocating anyone. clearly don‚Äôt understand income inequality computed. education inequality, might want double check states dumbest America.  US literally shit hole country now. Great rich. everyone else, much. I'd really really pissed owned locked business. without doubt he'd lost vote. lockdown either locked down, shouldn't. Taking liberties really leading example. wear second mask cover acne treat like virus quarantine week possible, always wear mask around others. you‚Äôre still feeling ok week chances didn‚Äôt contract it. go busy ER peak state fine. also didn‚Äôt check google mobility data shows Nevada slightly mobility reduction nation whole.

So google data, isn‚Äôt true.

You probably didn‚Äôt check, don‚Äôt give shit facts. aimed down, filter. direction means spraying, filter means catching anything might sprayed. Imperial College roll lately! case food banks - tend deals suppliers, giving money lot oomph donating food. really need study tell cloth mask obstructs aerosols better face shield?? believe numbers. It‚Äôs literally news. Google actually research speak. Right, doubts effectiveness cloth masks droplets aerosols. 
With mind, wonder plastic shields approved alternative cloth masks. people presents mild cold reinfection could many notice report it.

I sick December weird occurrences that, one occured March, another may.

The March 'cold' altered sense taste smell, weird chills, find comfortable temp, etc. Kids kinda minor cold time too. Lasted days.

In may broke rash hay fever like symptoms. Kids also got rashes too. Rash kinda looked like covid one's going around, covid produces many type rashes. pollen allergy like nothing before.

So either reinfection fits four month window. mean could called doctor got override. Actually limits early fills controls one good thing CVS did. CVS still suck though MISSION ACCOMPLISHED valve mask thinner cloth covering behind valve, remaining mask material thicker. means it‚Äôs like wearing normal cloth mask.

And that‚Äôs counting disposable filter element put valve.

So I‚Äôm sure would considered effective. Dont worry, probably doesnt teeth isnt enforceable. literally states renters would ‚Äúpay could‚Äù doesnt stipulate means, all. like recent executive orders useless. headline casual observer go ‚Äúoh look, guess hes helping.‚Äù feel countries Taiwan New Zealand much better role models handle pandemic lot honestly WILLFUL stupidity. People like truth, grab opposing argument fits narrative like better. 

My grandma NURSE close fifty fucking years went ballistic sharing ""updated death toll"" posts talking stupid shut economy deaths. mean Trump currently President. option November. 

Governors mayors given guidance residents. Nope, trying figure calculate 250,000 people Fauci's figure 190,000. know, elementary math. Maybe explain could exactly 180 Tuesdays. Majority all. exceptional, immunocompromised first place. Covid trigger, complications follow makes severe. wondering anyone would like check maths / logic? meant super rough estimate :)

I've tried estimate potential Australian mortality rate virus left go uncontrolled.

I used IFR Spain. pre-print excludes aged care numbers line observed IFR another anything slightly underestimates IFR second paper.

The biggest assumption virus would reach 70% population evenly. date actually hit aged care facilities harder general population.

I averaged male female ratios even though would slightly females males population. Victoria (VIC) population 6,490,000 Australia 25,499,884.

|Age Group|% age group|IFR (Male)|IFR (Female)|VIC Deaths|AU Deaths|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|&lt; 20|24.2|0|0|0|0|
|20-29|14.4|0.01|0.01|65|257|
|30-39|14.4|0.03|0.02|164|643|
|40-49|13.6|0.09|0.05|432|1,699|
|50-59|12.4|0.38|0.17|1,549|6,087|
|60-69|10.3|1.5|0.53|4,749|18,661|
|70-79|6.5|4.95|2.01|10,276|40,377|
|80 plus|4.2|11.62|4.62|15,493|60,875|

This tallies 32,730 deaths VIC 128,599 deaths across Australia.

So logic correct uncontrolled outbreak could lead death toll 80% average yearly death toll causes combined roughly 35 times worse influenza. Me!!! Hopefully Foxnews pushes Anti-Vax mentality rest us taking shit seriously finally mitigate risk they've imposed us. Great American Experiment stop. literally going get people killed spreading lies. saw headline immediately thought same.

Ok thanks!  would like make clear COVID-19 plague, China plague ""natural disaster"", earthquake, flood, typhoon, on.

According China's GB/T28921-2012 Classification Code Natural Disasters, ""epidemic disaster"" natural disaster. ""epidemic disaster"" refers sudden outbreak major epidemic disease caused microorganisms parasites animals humans, spreads rapidly causes high morbidity mortality, poses serious hazards production safety farming industry, causes damage human health life safety.

&amp;#x200B;

This definition differs China West. World Risk Report 2020 published World Economic Forum, Infectious diseases classified category ""social risk"" rather ""environmental risk"".

&amp;#x200B;

The good news KF94 approved replacements N95 according FDA surgical masks. wear KF94 shown FDA clearance surgical mask. know that. could 2019 abnormally deaths, next year bump corresponding size. exactly historical pattern. 

Well likely hypothesis, since know 6000 people died stands 2019, 2020.

I think either need glasses, else calculate exact numbers instead relying ""weird"" ""random"" it? 2020 data August yet. relevant timeframe. 

I'd much prefer wait untill entire year done.

There could changed last 30 years ""moved"" deaths year. need explain abnormally low numbers 2019 conclude this.

Why need that?

The numbers dropping steadily 1990 2019, nothing strange 2019 drop.

Ok US stop thing get publish opinions celebrities things don‚Äôt know anything about. Sincerely, world. idc ask bible thumpers believe upside cross sign anti christ.  think saying definitely possible early 2021 (although still optimistic look it) Fauci money every single thing that‚Äôs happened it‚Äôs saw future lol sounds great Fact, understand want... want get rid measurements, masks etc. current way get rid measurements vaccin, want that.... WANT  strike Underappreciated, huge contributor flattening curve. expensive either. pay people's salary (or fraction thereof high one) two weeks. much cheaper sending everyone country check. case, manufacturing bottleneck. US officials boasting recently procured ""hundreds thousands"" doses vaccines country 328 million. That's even less impressive consider (1) vaccine candidates may fail clinical trials (2) vaccines may need two doses per patient.

Look Moderna vaccine leading US bet. time, Moderna estimates ramp production [500 million 1 doses per year. Assuming two doses, means they'd need year vaccinate entire US population (and forget exports). annual vaccine, Moderna may even enough capacity keep entire US vaccinated.

What's shocking we've design vaccine since January 13, two days Chinese authorities released genome virus. We've known likely safe since Phase 1 completion May 18 got positive results summer antibody response. yet US invested $2.5 billion total, including $1.5 billion first 100 million doses. *you* gladly pay much $15 per dose get vaccine year rather potentially 2022?

The US investing **hundreds billions** Covid vaccine manufacturing Moderna Pfizer others hire retrain anyone could contribute even slightly. political punishment DJT got paying premium speed priority ventilator production, US politician take risk? voters care limiting estimated $8 trillion US GDP hit Covid, afraid possibility pharma companies make billion profit pay job? Home Callahan Auto Parts No, make sense teachers already purchased supply them. word looking ""vindictive""; showing strong unreasoning desire revenge. That's dopey then. Covid gone finally page regarding mask wearing. might sound really extreme, Europe really common get full month pay last business day month.

How ever survive? :) Time celebrations gatherings!   I‚Äôd love optimistic even optimistic production numbers seen don‚Äôt much produced quickly. hearing almost perfect rather normal. higher higher end get back, forget actual number got like 88 90 normal. crack. always feels clogged I'm always dizzy. I've constant attack since last year pretty much, besides one time extreme vertigo 4 days. think would even misleading coming people making it, messaging always best case end year tests showing promise. Hopefully mid next year everything back normal, granted think still lingering effects years people playing safe still opting physical distance going back rubbing shoulders people Yup OK Americans defend right free speech? fucking laugh. 

Your citizens shot beaten streets speaking systematic racism abuse human rights, think right get high horse dictate human rights correct democracy looks like. too! I'll take all. think kids teachers first line. China Africa mostly extract metals.

They Africa resources alone. Africa fastest urbanizing region world, contributing/handling big infrastructure projects, China also building next market next decades, well preparing gradually shift manufacturing sector China transitions towards mature service economy. feel like majority bikers 60 well probably best shape. want us get sick. 

they do, else herd immunity happen? I‚Äôm saying could come national television Monday NBA shut it‚Äôs season (Wednesday) schools shut (Thursday) New York‚Äôs spike started well northeast Italy going full lockdown could said ‚Äúhey, doctors epidemiologists scientists telling us serious good country would like absolutely non-essential businesses suspend person operations next month nip bud. followers would done it. weeks later evidence started come wearing masks would greatly reduce transmission virus could said ‚Äúhey, anyone going wear mask next months thing control...and followers would said ‚Äúok!‚Äù things happened would probably back full speed economy right now. Instead opposite fucked us all. British scientists (at Oxford, IIRC) already found dexamethasone dramatically reduced mortality several months ago, probably mechanism action. way, surprising.

I think dexamethasone subject shortages, finding another drug effects still big plus. eBay them. bought back $17-20 each. sure do....all required companies selling masks sell hospitals caregivers. Easy fix particularly advising government government mandated simple distribution fix. Rather telling whole nation go without masks, infecting millions people needlessly, convincing people masks help. people believed back including trump refuse wear masks months told ineffective useless were. specifically say N95, repeatedly. Time buy N99, N100, P100, etc.? stats many people underlying conditions Covid-19 survived? TIA links awesome.  talking about? actually published 9/3 (which tomorrow, live). current gets. Delta CEO made good point last month don‚Äôt want another bailout, want virus control. he‚Äôs willing lie that, he‚Äôs willing lie effectiveness rushed vaccine, believe given immunity resulting lawsuits may follow.

I‚Äôm vaccines. I‚Äôm hesitant Covid vaccine I‚Äôm certainly going take everything Fauci says face value he‚Äôs lost benefit doubt. disagree.

I also time become vaccine expert, always areas like -- defer views actual experts, satisfied rigor applied vaccine applied others. concerned hear vaccine rushed public release without rigor (as we've already seen Russia). Agree article clear. Obviously, assigning cause death factors one way downplay seriousness epidemic; indeed, may well main way Russia keep official reported population death rate covid unbelievable levels. appears folks USA trying use Russian playbook detriment rational analysis discussion. something something taxation without representation need shut whole country. Even China shut whole country. simply much harder, localized, targeted shut accompanied strict contact tracing. gym mandates wearing mask you‚Äôre immediate vicinity equipment you‚Äôre currently using provides spray bottle towel wipe equipment use. Even gym doesn‚Äôt mandate behavior, could worried infection. 


There haven‚Äôt cases covid within community gym, Seattle area gyms open couple weeks. fitting country shit people care other. Trump hands countey Putin? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  would meaningful, chances healthy non drug addicted 30 year old male dying next year pre Covid-19 Covid-19. 

I already linked numbers. ignored completely, figured interested throwing numbers zero context. Check post history. Looks pretty ‚Äúanti-mask‚Äù even though we‚Äôre still thick Antivax always r/coronavirus endgame thought it. Yup! ever heard rlf 100 (aviptadil)? ever heard cat drug could treat covid? ever heard monoclonal antibodies? ever heard anything outside Oxford, Moderna, Pfizer vaccines? Probably not! 

That‚Äôs problem these! reason say month next could serious turning point pandemic reasons! Aviptadil first drug completely blocks Covid replication approved month! 

Seems like people would happy things DIDNT work. simply want proven right! Genocide. Look getting sick dying most. wealthy white people. That's two whole weeks! Excellent, thank putting effort! funny thing people probably complaining 6 months can't get one priority list people say usually choose ignore. control want free markets either. Freedom got caught semantics game everyone wants freedom either facist communist. want left alone leave others alone. @mods Here's excerpt website. worst form public-health disinformation. yet see proper rebuttal notion extent given mask works stop spread virus puts wearer greater risk reinhalation eye exposure expelled now, extent masks effectively block transmission germs, essentially walking around wheelchairs mouths, immunological crutches making us weaker vulnerable Heh. Good question. That‚Äôs super cool dude. Im middle school teacher work year COVID limited teaching positions, woman town opening new day care run micro-school part it. I‚Äôm happy pay masks find anywhere, might reach still offer pay them! They're saying there's Covid want forced wear mask. That's reasonable. Unless coupled foreclosure protection, won‚Äôt stop people becoming homeless. see actual memo, news reporter got headline whole article wrong. memo references ""N95 Respirators"" ""N95 Masks"". go search Amazon ""N95 respirator"" get results masks respirators. large rubber respirators labeled ""respirators"" product titles. see memo school released, OSHA requirements training fitment employee allowed wear respirator.  Healthcare first responders 1st. This. 

I give shit anyone ESPN NFL NBA thinks COVID-19. got medical information/training place did.  Also Donald's Health Secretary? No. don‚Äôt. man 60s underlying health conditions, still went damn rally. wish smart enough protected himself. Perhaps asthmatics represented sever covid cases?

**Swedens deaths causes different year.**

Deaths per 100000 Sweden January-June last 30 following 2019 ver mild flu season lowest amount deaths per 100000 30 years. helps explain people divided politics religion Facebook posted pictures old co-worker mine crowded wedding reception. Yikes!

Holy shit. Sorry see that. Sending love Albuquerque. literally looks like US state propaganda. source according US officials. basically saying trust us, Russia bad. even managed throw China bad too. China fucking sucks propaganda. domestic propaganda shit international propaganda almost non existent. ever heard anything positive China, ever? 2nd highest GDP Americans believe Chinese dirt poor work sweatshops.

The claim drinking bleach able cure covid19 literally Trump himself. blaming people? overt US state propaganda. former epidemiologist says thinks strategy herd immunity, she‚Äôs 7 years job. However Tegnell says: ‚Äú ‚Äì Huvudtaktiken handlar ju inte om det, utan huvudtaktiken √§r att vi har en l√•ngsam smittspridning och att sjukv√•rden f√•r en rimlig arbetsro, s√§ger han till SvD och l√§gger till:

‚Äì De h√§r tv√• m√•len √§r inte motstridiga.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe main tactic isn‚Äôt (herd immunity), main tactic slow spread let health system peace work. However two goals aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive.‚Äù

Amin tactic slow spread Norway Denmar too, what, 1/10th? 1/20th? number deaths per capita slightly worse economic consequences. Don‚Äôt forget oxytocin, cortisol, adrenaline, nerve signals, things can‚Äôt think top head. Correct, masks designed primarily protect people wearing masks, others. valve either filters less all, allows wearer breath easier. Great person, everyone else. There's difference though. heart stops die cause considered cardiac arrest. lot questions whether seasonal virus. still spreads summer tropical areas, mean spread far worse winter.  split data seasonal areas Northern Southern Hemispheres tropics see overall patterns. quite clear hit populations year round, spread significantly worse cooler months. Southern Hemisphere winter diabolical. Northern Hemisphere lucky hit warming months.

[Deaths Covid Hemisphere CDC estimates flu deaths 24,000 - 62,000 Oct 1, 2019 - Apr 4, 2020.

190,000 sizable.

Rephrase way, new number one killer US, would undeniable, right?

This already number three killer US, graphic made long hit 190,000. predicting would hit number three. has. pandemic, joke. yeah like said closed case death rate based people tested, hundreds thousands millions people covid get tested it. it‚Äôs China, political conpsiracy theories acceptable agenda covid measures, US, they‚Äôre dumb?

No Don‚Äôt trust guy far could boot him. know person American schools care much attendance federal funding based attendance. Every day kid reduces funding. 

To honest America ever wonder X probably $ mean, SARS virus also stupid, origin issue. fact is, call disease SARS-2 consistent. call SARS-CoV's disease COVID-02. something delay given name, really inconsistent nomenclature. Right? Ok. brother stone cold alky. liver failure, kidney failure cause death? Heart failure. Like yah, usual, heart stops, die. know 8f trying spared come on. Cause death alcoholism bluntly. That's what's completely baffling Trump's focus dialing back testing case numbers look bad change number people going contract covid-19 die it. matter fact, cause ***even more*** die might infected asymptomatic people identified quarantined preventing infecting others. months maybe. completely isolate 6+ months end sight problem, I‚Äôd argue aren‚Äôt mentally stable all, current circumstances happen allow indulge habits. fuckin' wild drive Walgreens get COVID test biggest problem taxes. tax cigarettes ridiculously Australia. pouch tobacco $50 plus. packet 25 cigarettes $20. plain packaging, helped reduce rates shining though. know well math 60,000 smaller number 190,000.

fuck you, trump. Honestly, I'd love disproven. gonna lie. It'd simplify lot things. think possible, worth stressing over.

To keep using big bang example, comments. Hawking hypothesised cannot possibly know happened it, due nature singularity. evidence made one side other, singularity.

Now, science tell us put things like pedestal; I'm going stick now, I'm pretty convinced Hawking beat one.

So sydberro wants say ""yeah, God. He's always pulling crazy stunts like that."" cannot possibly say ""it not."" cannot possibly call fact. Either that, Hawking wrong. say ""I know happened, reason believe that.""

Which disprove sydberro all, it. admit defeat either. possible outcome disagree without either us winning losing - makes pretty boring pissing match reddit.  Cult45? Let show around...and maybe play sound...üé∂üé∂ It‚Äôs possible. Looks like administration ‚Äúmedical advisors‚Äù saying fastest path ‚Äúback normal‚Äù hurd immunity.

But you, everyone else continue everyone else nothing change. lesser two shits still shit. refused let anyone cdc develop test end February cdc test failed. 

The issue well covered press, go back read New Zealand

South Korea ...umm, 100% COVID cases, well 100% disease ends death, cardiac arrest occurs. clarify that. cardiac arrest cause death, fact cannot written death certificate cause. doctor must write lead cardiac arrest (example: traumatic injury leading hemorrhage leading cardiac arrest/death)

What data actually says 6% deaths reported COVID *only* cause death. Meaning COVID virus caused subsequent cardiac arrest.

The remaining 94% had, average according data, 2.6 comorbidities listed death certificates. Meaning COVID *one* causes, factors diabetes contributed. 94%, comorbidities *in combination* COVID virus caused deaths.

So sure, mean 94% die COVID, did. mean, 94%, COVID exacerbated comorbidities way died. proverbial ""straw broke camel's back"". Ultimately, data points idea COVID alone often kill people, lethal; comorbidities involved addition COVID. fact, least according data, somewhat rare COVID kill someone (6% time) comorbidities present. People get killed HIV, get killed AIDS onset infections body longer defend against, due virus. person never contracted HIV, likelihood would lived infections. difference Covid. Care expand mean then? Doctor captain obvious? could mean u mask up... u get asymptimatically infectedÔºü Yeah, causes SARS, name already name?

If named original SARS virus something else, gonna one? honestly let 'er ""Covid"" ""Covid virus"". Fuck it. others, prochoice Narrator: ‚Äúlittle know, everything could go wrong‚Äù No. guy replying put inaccurate spin fauci said. course Reddit running Coronavirus alone cause death? Without someone dying complication?  Prohibition War Drugs taught anything, would probably make problem worse banning commercial sale.  OK except 40%+ people died US were, definition group, unlikely live months (nursing home + long term care residents). may died did, many particular group likely would died now. statement 190,000 Americans would still alive false. \*edited clarify group\* think sane question, positively acting it, whether efficacy injecting bleach body?

Correlation imply causation.

We already know many people covid asymptomatic.

If someone dies infected covid-19.... know whether underlying cause without additional information claiming otherwise covid underlying cause doubt based positive test

Is simply true statement. Get numbers pedestrian deaths women 40s pre-existing conditions. 33 percent pedestrians killed drunk, 20% age 65, 15% age 5, 40% obese, 58% men...  Ok try again.

What first sentence typed post?

Ever good coach? Good boss? go make plays, make deals themselves? No, led team success....

I honestly can't believe explaining adult Blame china Yeah, aunt facebook morning talking it. ""Everyone died average 2.5 underlying conditions!""

""You're lifelong smoker, diabetic, high blood pressure! described yourself!"" Oh? engineer horrific response? job throw rule book window, within first week outbreak area (early March maybe 12th first confirmed case?) every single person staff direct contact covid positive people. got point many us we‚Äôre multiple exposures day. cold out, people runny noses coughs, fevers etc... would lie wouldn‚Äôt lose time, went 2 salaries home 1, grinding get much overtime possible. 1/4 staff caught it. didn‚Äôt find sense smell thing late too, people work sense smell weeks already news broke. Trumpurgatory They've pretending case months.

No one wants true, want pretend masks fix everything 2m distance going protect us. Otherwise would open schools go work go shopping go restaurants? else could order everyone back office ""get back normal"" good conscience? Lol  That's issue. virus called ""Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus-2"".

Calling virus disease confusing, especially there's separate name disease. reason apparent one really cares use directly; think even Fauci called virus COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2. looking data shows less people dying pneumonia since pandemic make percentage people dying Covid-19. understand thought process. Anyone data share? 

What don‚Äôt get flu vaccine (even have) health people refuse take covid getcha way easier quicker.

Edit: Flu leads pneumonia leads death people weak immune systems

Editing more: saw happening Italy friend family lived set home office (I silly people know) shut schools. 

And I‚Äôm NY. shit together. kids get virtually learned first term school. need confident hug grandmas luck enough around.  Oh dear, time flies... feel bad people. hardcore lockdown like curb mental health. Why's that? Illinois State University reached 800 President pictured maskless restaurant surrounded maskless individuals. Two corrections far. massive increase compared Sweden's decrease.

Sweden still new cases per day feel sad sex workers, Everytime go see girls corner. tough life, even right now. Agreed. perfect attendance last 7 years public school. also means went school sick couple times. Luckily regular occurrence never anything worse sore throat still bad policy. lol month ago Vietnam case, repost, bad bot Swedish cases going down. Danish cases going up. get it. lie protect domestic supply masks medical workers. It‚Äôs painful way protect people needed most. time watching Chinese nationals stroll hardware stores buy entire stock ship home. It‚Äôs uncomfortable situation. That‚Äôs ones detected. block former friend keeps bringing fact lot people died underlying illnesses. stupid majority americans underlying illnesses. course overweight counts risk factor. point simply care flaws Democratic party has, Republican party committing treason like morning breakfast. absolutely believe case. live, we‚Äôve decent government response people wear masks, think that‚Äôs it‚Äôs harder wrap head around bad parts US. She‚Äôs careful believes virus real; think it‚Äôs wants believe isn‚Äôt bad originally told normal life restored. empathize she‚Äôd easily swayed conspiracy theory. statistics work? No.

It anything acknowledge extremely susceptible senior population.  
I'm arguing covid kill them. definitely did. I'm making guess look total yearly death toll 2020 2021, going stand much think will, lot deaths fall covid umbrella includes flu pneumonia going occur anyway, fall/ winter typically do. 

Who knows, could totally wrong. Guess we'll find 6 months so. guess aline actual situation. absolutely decided let run free. would still insist 14 days quarantine, would shut large sections Beijing? 80,000 people US die due flu last flu season? Hate keeps presented ""Fauci says"" instead actual facts known. human race embarrassment. may well taken viruses. say burden proof rests?

Why wouldn‚Äôt rest person objective evidence claim?

Hawaii shut bit Florida. Lol Here. fucking winter. like bad flu season. it‚Äôs fucking LIFE, dying politically mandated basement. Thanks math correction, much Denmark's massive increase compared Sweden's decrease. that, extremely short-sighted. reason quarantine wear masks want fucking virus gone. Reducing possibility spreading covid helping much helps others. boils people myopic entitled. people care instant gratification effects tons aspects society. 

I honestly know would go fixing though lock house complain internet. I'm waiting everyone says big deal catch on. insta-muscle meatheads start giving damn realize able swole anymore!  like choose thing? word wanted ""sequelae"". didn‚Äôt make personal attack here‚Äôs comment warning everyone dire situation Denmark 

My response another comment said Denmark‚Äôs cases growing breakneck speed‚Äù know hit 150 per day, would match Sweden‚Äôs rate new cases per day per million

Well never did, see never heard back 

As pointed Denmark‚Äôs growth nowhere near thought would That's kinda society works. Hell, never would evolved past primate stage strong sense community effective social skills.

Even think benefit directly, highly likely do. Still useful. Even asymptomatic cases showing heartbreaking damage. Knowing keep eye useful.

Bloody useless public health purposes, hey, mainstream conservative message flu. word want ""sequelae"". Aaah! Gotcha. probably article, huh?  would probably nice infinity money buy hundred rapid test machines per school

this kid tested coming school No, fact, understanding statistics.

We measure many people die week, year year.

And see there's extra 190,000 people died 2020 United States, *who would otherwise died.*

These called ""excess  called bullshit immediately moved goal posts Scott strong ties Johnson. It‚Äôs shit show Iowa City. opened testing center middle campus even see even implement strategy point makes sense whatsoever. Depends country, guess. Europe careful sending students back school mask mandates. touching political issue using available data proper policy making based scientific results. Unfortunately, many countries stupidity prevails politicians rather push agenda, whatever reason, listening experts. good thing healthcare data collection happens automatic independent political decisions countries. even politicians listen, data available publication months/years. article July, one really seems taken real steps toward ""immunity passports"" since probably pretty obvious unworkable solution is. Though see countries requiring proof vaccination international travel 2021 possibly longer. It‚Äôs person. called bullshit moved goal posts China truly role model world. appreciate candor. taught bit patient explanations. apologize curt. Ah true. Enjoyed wrong degree there.  I'm saying reality complicated. possible every single person stay home given time.

Unfortunately people get sick die, even stayed home. people ""died covid"" covid kill something else would sooner rather later. Well said place won‚Äôt listen they‚Äôll delete comment soon enough. Tests tell kid infected 12 days ago. Could infected 10 days ago. yes, kind test utterly worthless besides statistics value. could recommended seem missing point. ASU's enrollment 100,000 2017 (that include 14,000 staff) could easily 10,000 cases. matter slightest people wearing mask. Eventually become infected/immune virus subside. EVERYBODY PANIC ORANGEMANBAD TEACHERS UNION GOOD

there million people dead virus year around world, let alone million children end school year. I'm president. totally agree Maybe every country take lesson Chinese government. kids fine. SuRpRiZeD!!!!!!!!! middle class parents, sure. parents won‚Äôt send kids back classroom anyway help it. 

For poor kids, masks. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve thought lot about. Schools adequate supplies like masks spare students without them. work?

Even them, kids lose them, forget home, break them, find new &amp; ingenious ways generally fuck act wearing mask. sooo, saying hung home keep dad around 9+ years? costs chronic damage done survivors going horrendous, employer provided health insurance system certain path failure.

Sure, I'll get antibiotics strep throat. get cancer? heart attack? guess I'm gonna let nature take course, option eliminate first generational ""wealth"" opportunity family's history. 50/50 thing COVID would calamity. worth ruining industry, ruining social relationships, people getting depressed can't go beach parks, letting old people die alone? I'm anti vaccine all, vaccine safe? seems awfully rushed. 

I'm scared get hopes up. year hell far. political problem. election 2 months. Filtering air going makes sense wearer sick. reason everyone needs mask otherwise can't tell asymptomatically sick. using N95 better responsibly, reasonably sure get sick, vent fine.

You'd need rule can't ""just work"" though Fauci optimistic, I'm optimistic. LOL, planet living? Pretty disappointed they‚Äôve handled someone went TTUHSC realise (its spelt outside North America) know opinion that?  aren‚Äôt thing. right. simply one ways argue bad faith.

Strawmanning another. least testing slowed down, fulfilling boss' demands.   HR needs justify paychecks, they're hoping higher turnover die? come free Corona? school go dorms cheaper off-campus? That's rhetorical question - I'm actually curious. big state school located city, dorms waaay expensive everybody moved campus soon allowed to. Innocent proven guilty. take pitchfork absolutely sure.  Legend came about? Cut back testing know winter comes, great disappointment follows. wasn't.  ""Second biggest county state second cases deaths""
 
- Headline newspaper biggest county cases deaths use good mask responsibly, get infected first place Sadlarious lol oh expert advice matters.

250,000 250,000. Spin want, numbers lie. can't lie. like president. That‚Äôs really true. Phase one two test young people can‚Äôt detect rarer adverse events sample size.

Again, can't spot weak genetics everyone. That's annoying part. tf politics get way E-VERY-THING?! Speak yourdamnedself!

On hand still seems struggle remembering put underwear getting ready school. made plenty arguments. Unsubstantiated ones. argue bad faith. wouldn‚Äôt say mass testing. free testing sites campus lines long it‚Äôs even worth Nothing. We're basically short stops fascism.

We stop arguing whether over-reporting under-reporting, saying US cases tests most, blaming states recording people died home, etc. Cause death isn‚Äôt straight forward assign. Real life complicated.

If so, yes!

I'd love go see smashmouth could throw [bread too, he'll never full credibility mind flip flopping masks. masks day 1, knows that.  wrong. Americans free go Mexico via air travel.

You wondered downvoted gave impression, care less life say. No, tests accurate all. posted thread, cross post news:


So last week grandma really serious stomach issues, scheduled Dr appointment. goes appointment, test covid, apparently tests positive. also tell give stomach days, see gets better. Call things get real bad.

Well things got real bad stomach, goes emergency room. test covid, tell she‚Äôs never covid, able tell wrong stomach. Apparently common complication stomach staple surgery 10+ years ago. Easily fixable.

Anyway, think first hospital told covid turned positive test government? course fucking did. NEVER covid! common scenario really? looking trials too. talked co-worker one (not sure which), sounds like lot work thought would be. fill kinds logbooks symptoms go multiple blood draws tests. Yeah I‚Äôve ordered old n95‚Äôs vent new ones without one. They‚Äôre bootleg. website apple pay button. used that. didn‚Äôt make account anything. Yeah, demon-semen crazy doctor lady Trump touting saying safe, uh, no.  I'll still trust anyone reddit. Back normal soon! We‚Äôre going win! That's concern well though isnt it? frontline healthcare workers Guinea pigs, happens goes south fast? ""Change filters""? N95 disposable... modular filters.

And masks modular filters give choice: filter used, can't breathe Wuhan vaccine virus originally came Wuhan China.  calling people stupid, guess ignorant would better word. crazy trust vaccine works long clue long term effects be.  sad think many people sheep go get vaccine daddy government said should. left wing events?

Your poor daughter! cruel one make policy pain-killers aren‚Äôt covered??! mean really matter, that‚Äôs like saying building shouldn‚Äôt fire retardant properties could still burn. think people understand herd immunity thing; universally applicable. point, ""anti-herder"" really disingenuous slur.

Herd immunity requires conditions effective, mainly, requires form immunity (vaccine natural) act firebreak.

The squishy aspects (in current state ignorance): less good immunity last long enough. less good reinfection possible. less good reinfection comes severe outcomes second go around.

Before reach state knowledge, we're guessing/gambling. tough spot although things know know, also things know know. 6-9 months enough time developments unfolded. Healthcare workers, aged 18-65, wearing simple procedure masks care patients potentially COVID-19 asymptomatic, symptomatic tested positive yet, aren‚Äôt contracting COVID-19. least rates led believe would happen. 

By means, wear makes comfortable mask wise, unless rooting around someone‚Äôs airways, blasting sputum everywhere, blowing droplets around, isn‚Äôt airborne disease movie Outbreak. want wear N95, make sure exhalation valve covered simple mask prevent unknowingly spreading COVID-19. made up. N95 approved unless vent front. It‚Äòa definitely new virus you‚Äôre right! moms classic comeback ‚Äúwe. Just. Don‚Äôt. Know.‚Äù

But large extent know now. Like I‚Äôve said others, virus definitely reason concern, reason wear masks, reason cautious! say continue isolating acting know absolutely nothing virus absolutely ridiculous! pisses off! 

I‚Äôve gone gym, restaurants (only outside) I‚Äôve totally fine I‚Äôve extremely cautious around older people people don‚Äôt know general don‚Äôt know feel whole thing they‚Äôd comfortable stayed away fine! 

Peoples mindset went ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù ‚Äúeradicate virus‚Äù quickly. Eradicating virus isn‚Äôt feasible all. virus nowhere near deadly thought back March, April, May, etc That's dont data analytics job. Yea right, falls definition biological terrorism.

CDC ultimate resource medical advice according mom (a nurse) kid. trust say part double check much possible... know who's truthful isn't? wonder American people confused. try find scientific consensus damn hard layperson sift all.

Edit: *and professors, many fall ""high-risk"" groups severe Covid-19outcomes, Meeting potential spouse? COVID-36 could *right* around corner?! least exhaled breath necessary pass *through* mask, much go around mask, accelerated There's always two sides everything. People say never take vaccine people say take whatever vaccine inject already, wrong right time. gotta super positive news, gotta take grain salt. time, really negative news, always assume worst. pendulum never stays one side. Always consider everything make decision based facts, feelings. I'm change mind, I'm saying trust Western ""sources"" *obvious* red flags blanketed place.

You critical CPC (and encourage so), mean one loose critical thinking due ideological bias (f.e., consider side arguments, go read reports serve Western media, make opinion).

For bottom line: found anything credible corroborate CPC saying (""reeducation"" deradicalization centers fight terrorism) rather support West pretending (large scale concentration camps eradication one ethnic minority China, ""sinization"" learning Mandarin (lol) renouncing culture, etc.). contention point Western countries preventive counter terrorism done Xinjiang, none actually providing concrete alternative centers.

From worth, I'm glad China going full-American blanket whole place Iraq-style pile rubles. quite frankly, could, anything it. not. Direct corporate masks can't wear ones vent. let air unfiltered, defeat purpose protecting others. Universities overstepping bounds suspending students things campus ""good news"", OK... issue past vaccines? wear mask presumptious bloke. protest moreso geared towards *oppressive lockdown measures* rather anti-mask call *this* authoritarianism?

**That's exactly happened:** *""The photo shared Facebook Sunday Pennsylvania resident Chesapeake Bay restaurant time.""* do. Every step way, US government done quite literally everything make sure virus spreads quickly possible, many people die possible.

Theres even hint doubt mind purpose malicious intent.

It's impossible think they've made many dozens decisions directly harm people, literally 0 help people, accident. purpose. This. We're 6 months thing everyone even get tested promptly want to. Thinking six months everyone wants able get vaccine fantasy. ER baby daughter can‚Äôt wear mask nervous exposure. pediatrician reassuring mask wearing. nurses/receptionists, whomever wearing mask okay! got tested days sure  one common sense would believe single thing current DHS says. admin &amp; GOP don‚Äôt care ‚Äòlow life‚Äô including teachers &amp; students public schools get sick &amp; die. Fewer mouths, fewer people getting SS, etc  constituents ban all? Might well get sick spending money locally get sick another state. Surely understand hypocrisy this. disease stay Maryland. Depending broadly state throws net ""healthcare worker,"" teacher well may difficult replace.  

Consider takes meet requirements teacher versus nurse: Teachers go school longer state requirements frequently require rigor nurse.  

You pop nurse out, start finish, two years, community college training. 

You may difficulty word ""replaceable."" I'm saying one important another. That‚Äôs pretty important clarification. 

I‚Äôm actually pretty confident Democratic *leadership* pretty responsible messaging... again, know moment no-name congresscritter facing close race starts raising doubts vaccine, it‚Äôll make front pages, I‚Äôm less confident *entire* caucus remain responsible disciplined leadership. Sure, can‚Äôt say sure due covid without antibody test. things cause issues, like auto-immune disorders infectious agents. present certainly want treatment. 

Lupus one comes mind (no, don‚Äôt need rash), though autoimmune attack heart occur nearly infection. Staph aureus food poisoning also lead pericarditis. Infectious agents directly cause heart damage could also include e. Coli, coxsackie virus, strep, flu, gastroenteritis 

Not COVID couldn‚Äôt caused it, lot people speculate illness last 9 months could coronavirus, need verify. Especially considering treatments. certainly US comes first vaccine, medical papers reviewed internationally- pay attention whether countries criticize sub strange. Group hardcore doomers mixed people looking literally ANYTHING good latch to, regardless is. entire article dedicated single Fauci quote lol. Nothing Reddit downvoting facts! acting like didnt read article talked final paragraph? long unselfish service Italy. this. unfair!  text post bit deceptive. exactly testing materials, rather mask types. one labelled fleece neck gaiter, bandana type double layer (folded once), rather suggested 6-8 layer style commonly seen.

Your point valid though. vented mask par relative drop count several commonly used mask styles, significantly lower mask. issues using paper compare ability masks prevent COVID transmission, fair say vented mask certainly better mask, things major  minor axis returned  algorithm   direct measure droplet size, measurement amount light scattered particle camera aperture (binary diameter). [...] Due small dynamic range camera (8-bit),  droplets saturate  camera. 

This likely neck gaiter result higher none, droplets smaller diameter. use filters inside cloth masks. telling people using without filters??? Anyone buy N95 masks

Fascism response wealthy elite power wealth threatened. thing elites feel threatened unified people demanding change: cannot fight that. 

This fascism rose rapidly 2012 2016, worldwide: Think back, going back then? Occupy. Arab Spring. Actual unified groups citizens worldwide pointing finger castles hill first time long time, simultaneously recognizing problem bankers wall street. They're ones driving car. drive Democrats office drive Republicans office. two groups work behest Wall Street, point blank period. 

So how'd elite react Occupy? regrouping, months later pumping billions dollars social justice, turn made us enemies again. sides. we're fighting among ourselves, fighting them. doubled *hard*. Feminism, Racism, etc etc etc. installed dictators thugs wherever could. arguing genders, races. races, red vs blue. red vs blue religion. on: plant divisions calculated intention. blatant became almost comical handling it: Look GamerGate rest. shit real money real political gumption behind it.

Talking [Sen. requested frequently - 6 times - prominent NCI Cancer hospital husband getting treatment, whether routinely tested staff. answer no. think exposure, told get outside testing own. random testing staff.

Hospitals poor job stopping spread health care workers health care workers patients. hospitals also transparent. asked many nurses HCWs infected, refuse answer. Absolutely, don‚Äôt last forever. There‚Äôs still noticeable shortage many places. think it‚Äôs appropriate doctors nurses assigned covid wards, surrounded virus day, priority. It‚Äôs much likely difference life death situations.
More studies posted nearly daily basis effectiveness cloth masks distancing reducing exposure even allowing less severe symptoms upon infection. 
When there‚Äôs shortage, N95‚Äôs belong faces literally surrounded virus day. strategies mitigate spread everyone else. I‚Äôm trying say.

I'm curious pricing saw masks compared something like sell known? I'm really sure mean that. known they're going die? that's life insurance works. they're buying one policy. Take walmart example one point 350,000 employees life insurance policies taken secret. Coming firm near soon! predictable, like clockwork. check back weeks fallout Trump's RNC convention speech. bailout used stock buybacks CEO bonuses rather saving employees?  Addenum #1: clarify lower effective herd immunity threshold due current interventions &amp; social distancing place. interventions relaxed, would go back higher HIT.""

The logic sound, mean make assertions numbers would be. Would burnout threshold, absence *any* behavioral interventions, rise 60%? 40%? 25%? know. We're *meant* know, sound logic... sound logic.

We look evidence, though. virus spreading low enough levels remains control

If casting aside burnout threshold viewing behavioral modifications primary driver (which pretty clearly contradicts Gu saying, least SW states), account sharp differences ""under control"" means across differently behaving states followed burnout pattern. Like, let's compare NY FL.

**NY:** Google Mobility retail &amp; recreation data drops super sharply -75% 4/12. Daily new deaths per day also peaks 4/12 estimated 17.3% infected.

Mobility r&amp;r improves gradually continuously without much pullback. 6/1 around -43%. virus done nothing recede. end August -20%. Still sign COVID.

Conclusion: Sharp behavioral changes early on. Sharp spike virus early on. High proportion infectivity early on. Gradual return normal. return virus.

**FL:** Google Mobility retail &amp; recreation data drops super sharply -66% 4/12. Daily new deaths low - much virus right now. Total infected estimated around 1.1%.

Mobility r&amp;r improves gradually continuously. 6/1 around -21% total infections estimated around 2.6%. Thereafter, start see growth cases, followed growth daily new deaths.

Discounting 7/4 obvious reasons, daily r&amp;r mobility never dips -34%. *At point Florida course-correct behavior anywhere near sharply NY April*. R&amp;R mobility mostly spends July August hovering around -25% - barely difference caseload started grow - yet hit apparent peak Aug 5. Infected population estimate, guessed it, 17.8%.

Conclusion: Sharp behavioral changes early on. much virus one way other. low proportion infectivity early on. Gradual return normal. Virus eventually starts grow. Tangible, small changes behavior hold candle delta exhibited NY April (i.e. event ""brought everything control""). Despite markedly different observed changes behavior, peak hit around % NY's peak.

I think crux saying, agree with, distancing, lockdowns, masks, et al sort impact allow burnout reached lower range, i.e. 10-20% range we're seeing consistently. going example, though, interventions appear making smaller difference compared profound impact reaching burnout.

You argued consistent, extremely low levels spread harm NY necessarily mean burnout, primarily, that's helping NY, since heterogeneity model anticipates low levels followed explosive growth. know that's necessarily right reading heterogeneity models (Gu's model, instance, really predict explosive growth anywhere *or* show historical trends) interpret saying mean NY, enough controls eventually relaxed, believe explosive growth ala March/April would return? happens landlords can't pay mortgages banks start repossessing houses? people around, reasonably safe, research suggest heavy breathing expel lot less virus particles talking/shouting, see  number gym outbreaks (excluding fitness classes) small. people exercising nearby without masks would move far away, surfaces longer believed major risk (see ) tell covid sinus infection? nose running throat SLIGHTLY irritated sore. headaches, fever, breathing trouble.

Also, get tested Thursday, results labor day? Going lot cheap Harleys available soon! no. saying safe/effective vaccine would developed year end. sayng apparatus producing effectively distributing vaccine would place year end. he's still saying important bit. New York class action suit nursing home survivors? finally someone's it, many people told 2016 they'll leave Trump gets elected nothing happened. OSHA still enforcing regulations regarding N95 respirators. Employers still lot obligations regarding fit testing, education, etc employees wear N95 respirators. legitimate reasons requirements, including extra stress hearts lungs using N95s, although arguments made concerns outweigh reasons requirements waived. It‚Äôs cut dry many seem believe. Things could actually helped stamp outbreaks instead slow ""controlled"" levels. matter? 200k excessive deaths? find info? Everything pretty much open Vietnam. Bars clubs packed one cares wearing masks indoors, fined you‚Äôre wearing one outdoors doesn‚Äôt make much sense. Found bears fan? also can't rule **someone kept humans, pangolins bats trapped cave 30 years untill one humans escaped travelled Wuhan.**

That scenario possible, extremely unlikely. flu vaccine like 50/50. That‚Äôs best example. It‚Äôs vaccination, immunization vaccine guarantees complete permanent immunity. That‚Äôs many vaccines boosters still outbreaks even high vaccinated populations.  What's even worse first sentence article unsourced appears completely false. WI DHS mandating all, single school district is. might want look 19th century closely. Lots instances smallpox, typhus, yellow fever happening around time, six cholera pandemics 19th century. parties 5 points, greek houses general stupidity, suprising numbers higher. soup kitchens, food banks, churches. He's 94% count s/ mean, sociopaths really care people saying anyway... 5 months report exact same. Almost permanent brain fog, high pressure head feel ears (crackling noises touch area around ears move jaw sideways) gives frequent headaches.

And also chest pain, still idea comes from. respiratory issues likely lungs. heart rate seems fine exercise full capacity. I've fibroscopy performed found evidence acid reflux. go weekly cycle, hurts clearly feel strongly press fingers sternum.

I've seen numerous doctors none able explain feel everything feel. kid started middle school California. None teachers wear masks *because they‚Äôre teaching zoom like everyone else be.*

Yeah, get it. world‚Äôs collapsing. don‚Äôt see sending kids schools US answer. Happy cake day. would involve acknowledging pandemic continue struggle understand saying political person gets comment removed, even though entire fed admin made virus political. literally understand people can't understand this. rule sub Reddit? I‚Äôm happy provide proof whatever say fact based? said nothing can‚Äôt easily backed up. article specify August yet. Death reporting &amp; analysis slow-ish process. elaborate? zoomed looks like covering nostrils me. understand can't work school. got coronavirus march risk going work? know overwhelmed right?

You get that?

You get still running ragged?

Nothing done state level help hospitals reducing patient loads, recruit labor beg local officials relief. It‚Äôs overused trope point, think tourism like Amity Island summer mayor let people get eaten great white shark?

If he‚Äôd shut beaches couple weeks let Brody, Quint Hooper kill shark, nobody would remembered shark year later. trying save one Fourth July weekend, mayor made Amity synonymous deadly shark attacks years come. lived Korea work sick too, less H1N1 masks already thing (not everyone people wear sometimes sick). testing/ tracing strategy reflected culture too. value privacy much value collective responsibility. 

The US bother trying much slow Covid fix economy. I'm saying could Covid free. large country thay easily. choose dumpster fire. sociopaths blank, emotionless faces anyway, mask superfluous. Problem? voted for, bunch idiots. Related Armbrust Twitter reelection prospects grow dimmer day.

Ahh... yeah, that. simply matter facts are, even tiniest shred doubt shitstain appointed second term. election predictable point Russia would be. hell Fauci? are. likely vaccines progress millions doses produced case turn work. immediately start vaccinating people.  BLUE, want 12:01 pm January 20? (Assuming win, likely certain.) wonder many actual symptoms, mild severe, many need hospitalizations. would great data see! amount people frontline larger amount items available protect them, ""frontline"" redrawn certain jobs prioritized numbers align. understand? miners actually something virus miners got sick closest relative SARS-CoV-2 found, sampled, collected Wuhan Institute Virology. sick-out. Teachers Oklahoma recently avoid strike rules. bit confused then. said lockdown stuff open. Sweden lockdown lot things closed businesses learn operate following recommendations (provide hygiene, good distance clients ensure health safety staff). Gyms **have** close, lot figure possible provide better ventilation limit people/transmission. cinemas continued operating limited mode closed public viewings started offering private screenings certain cities. Restaurants bars provide table service limit number people provide distance tables - meant lot restaurants either temporarily closed moved take-away deliveries only. yeah, hairdressers continued work, people mostly working home, think many people needed fix hair much? contributed spread much? 

So big difference here. measure lockdown actually think made infections drop? Cause know Norway stated infections (and Rt) already dropping lockdown decided on, definitely case Sweden. amount dead Sweden 1st 7th April - 2 weeks 3 weeks lockdowns neighbours started (so maybe enough time start seeing drop infections, enough see drop deaths serious hospitalizations lag infections), see infection much widespread Sweden even that. Every country losing tourism revenue...All guide friends around world begging money. reminds hospital administrators fired nurses wore ppe bought optics. somewhat old news.. remember saying couple months could shaved vaccine results promising enough seem care though either since precautions save individual, especially handwashing. 

So I'm sure makes them. exceptionally thorough sociopaths hate everyone including themselves, moronic narcissists care believe threat real? N95 respirators masks designed protect wearer inhaling small particles. Surgical masks cut this, designed source protection, prevent wearer contaminating environment around them. Respirators tight fitting meant form seal around face filter everything inhaled. american leaders akin people passing bomb one hand hoping explode themselves. Little know, playing close room, going perish....Change way things people, defuse bomb rather keep passing on. say, Mask mandated! amount bullshit coming subreddit fucking stupid now. Ita almost like anbody post whatever days even though stupidest coronavirus news. Pelosi's salon visit, dont trust lawmakers. Worse Pelosi brazenly flauting rules state. people done dying? good now? current administration lauds it..... Good call, didnt think that, understand frustration, unvented n95s seem fine. think cdc needs better job making things clear. biggest issue article headline stated, tbh. Wait announcement hits prior election vaccine available. definitely skip part vaccine won‚Äôt available en masse later 2021. said they‚Äôve handled it.

Also viruses aren‚Äôt living creature tragically totally expected. vaccine all. probably even gonna access anyway. Could end like annual flu shot. think realize dealing troll. genuinely curious even fathom happened.

I food delivered house delivery driver set door storm door, little space between. Less 6"". Ok cool problem.

As soon driver left, go pick opened door smell weed hit like bag bricks. obvious smoking car smell got stuck plastic food bag.

State Food Security

The U.S. largest food-insecure population world‚Äôs high-income countries among worst performers

‚ÄúWe longer projecting surge‚Äîwe experiencing surge food insecurity,‚Äù said Allison O‚ÄôToole, chief executive officer Second Harvest Heartland, provides truckloads food distributions like one Mankato.

During pandemic, 10th American households reported haven‚Äôt enough food given week. That‚Äôs shocking figure world‚Äôs richest country. It‚Äôs double pre-Covid figures highest since comparable government data starts 1995.

In contrast Dust Bowl years Great Depression rationing World War II, crisis nothing food supplies. U.S. time historic abundance, plentiful grains, meat dairy, much farmers plowing excess crops dumping milk. lockdowns snarled supply chains, food inflation projected rise fastest pace almost decade. Meanwhile, unemployment, low wages reduced working hours diminishing purchasing power‚Äîall disproportionately impacting women minorities, food insecurity.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

When happened Communist China USSR, historic international scandal. 

Look us üò£ vaccine all. states allowing sites properly zoned allow distribution administration. work 0330? say Dr. Birx she‚Äôs epidemiologist platformed White House? Given perpetually idiotic statements Trump, may condemnation.  would swim mile Covid water cast ballot fall get rid current failure ""leadership"". probably worded original comment like rather coming across like *attacking go BLM protests.* know dude, care much protests rallies really.

People still going want, there's way actively stop something without starting something way passionate. weird fucking time live worrying people believe wasted energy.

Edit:*you're actually attacking can't think another way say it* People going Die without Herd Immunity. However going full lock economic repercussions would almost certainly cause suffering. Currently half measuring lock order maintain sort economy. slowing Herd immunity ruining economy. cultures value extroversion individuality (US, Australia). cultures value extroversion collectivism (Southern Europe, Middle East, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America). cultures value introversion individuality (probably somewhere Northern Europe). cultures value introversion collectivism (East Asia).

What south east Asia ? pretty extrovert cases ... Even less February. k still hospital beds right? work sales today client mine (who meet person) turned offer, shook hand, proceeded tell rally. I've never used much sanitizer. Probably fiscal reasons. seems zoning anything else. According map, countries mask requirements. explain excess death ? sudden surge car accidents lockdown ? CDC issue eviction moratoriums masks somehow state rights issue. Licensing permit expedition one thing. long that. hate able give safe vaccine (like Oxford) first line workers held building zoned retail medical something.  Still seen local police wearing masks. got sick something else.

That's possible. Hence, call COVID even, SARS. SARS-like pneumonia known relative means lot. looking covid, relatives. might relatives far away point origin.

You aware general scientific community claiming SARS-CoV-2 nature closest relative, RaTG13, found nature right? Wait headlines? Corona-chan give bunga bunga. idolize mean post audio saying n word banned it? 

Still waiting enlightenment! know today, corona virus cases? Wow! know that! 

Did know year, new flu strain new flu cases daily? Wow! know that! mr bringing flu? Well know, covid flu kill people underlying conditions. level death acceptable force worldwide lock downs disease? bad flu levels, covid levels? 

Tomorrow coming, next day. Next year could seeing COVID-20, COVID-21 next. happens can't even control COVID-19 masks ""lockdowns"" opens COVID-20 hits? 

Ohh, it'd easy answer could answer acceptable level death much seethe hoping people die right.

COVID-19 even CLOSE DEADLY want be. pretend like OMG ACTIVE CASES!!!! WORLD ENDING!!!!

uhh, no. Go outside fucker. Projections said even lockdowns we'd half mil happen  deterrents. like Hawaii ‚Äúenforces‚Äù 2-week quarantine. You‚Äôre boned get caught. not, a-okay. Yea right. Keep moving goalposts. countries also boring countries, I'd rather happy extrovert. teachers second?

Why making straw man here? Nobody. Nobody cares Trump getting ventilators faster. Everyone cares stupid shit fucked up. absolutely fucking nothing getting vaccine faster. listening people like Fauci Bill Gates this.

McKesson must building bunch ultra low temp distribution storage facilities. Ja next wunderwaffe covid.... reloaded Quote CDC‚Äôs website:

Dentists stickin hands people's mouths day... yeah, Clorox is. right. probably lower understand really strict rules still. people use masks (correctly)? 

Not even distancing? home sick etc?

Hahah

No, people smoking coughing lungs street. terrifying. That's true. 

And that's keep reading past graphs mentioned whatever reasons countries hit harder, case Spain, exact moment, institutions saturated causing problems delays everywhere. 
Surely rate positives, resources tackle completely, graph mentioned would look different. Every time bring shut room 30 kids 7 hours day I'm told ""shut lazy teacher, special. Get ass work."" severe brunette? lol fuck about? Nah!!! /s Sensationalist news headline.

Reading actual thing, says ""not encouraged"", makes sense. However, chosen wear one, ""If get it, get it."" - rallying cry stupid need national strategy. can't let one state spread disease want ""reopen economy"" whatever.  open country protests? Well, see, medical professionals degrees see patients seem think so. see degree? 

Although trying push herd immunity colleges little back, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre best idea guy around here. Here's archived copy can't get around paywall : Based what? think confused post GOOGLE... think they've implementing herd immunity strategy almost beginning. told husband months ago. Except really think feel losing risk members community acceptable loss. Perhaps even benefit. nothing help people risk work force. There's strategy, alternatives people need stay home. can't afford quit job stay home guess pretty screwed. horrifying. SiDeS sAmE! No, aren't. want compare two side's bad behavior, Democrats commit jaywalking, maybe shoplifting, Republicans committing mass murder. Okay really hate argument

 

Children 10 likely spread virus adults. High schools particular students pretty much biologically speaking adults near ones (without fully developed brain obviously).

They fine symptoms bad, real issue become spreaders virus parts population less likely survive. least wore masks... neither. thinking ""oh no, kindergartener caught deadly virus."" all, literally admitted crime posted social media. may agree laws, laws there. lawyer would told say nothing, let work, made argument magistrate actions taken far outweighed crime, real risk magistrate may forced hand punishment would otherwise.   
Honestly, best thing anyone others say nothing police without legal advocate present. [This America, holds true care. others. shitty thing say. It‚Äôs true USA doesn‚Äôt owe anyone country anything. 

But neighbour real dick, garage caught fire, suddenly couldn‚Äôt remember number fire brigade. Weirdest thing. get work race somehow, start school. intereseting, then? well never make true okay based assumption mistake, look hundred thousand mistaken read hundred thousand German study linked flawed authors issued correction.

For crying loud, people, pick book! life lives loved ones could well depend it. get fucking deserve. Idiot.

Well done police keeping situation calm (not counting idiot's crocodile tears. see making hyperventilate work emotional response missing decided promote event would put lives risk.)

Ballarat full great people, one them. Asymptomatics may still suffer tissue damage even show symptoms. still sick, much others. **Interesting data UK:**

Sorry confusion, meant quote post stated ""6% death rate underlying causes"", quote article tables turned Mexico need get people around get sick. ‚ÄúStudies shown‚Äù. flu vaccine damn scare tactic jfc. agree kids shouldn‚Äôt schools right now. media completely control title click bait fake news. kid went 1 day tested positive kid already Yes, actions government, all, political. ALMOST LIKE inaction end caused Covid far worse! Take situation second let pass, unlawful protest goes ahead, instead arresting one person (who bail probably get stern warning magistrate when/if goes court), end arrest dozens angry Karens Kens putting even people risk. God forbid protest got bit pushy shovey lady gets knocked kerfuffle causing harm baby. everyone would screaming ""Why police, stop happening first place?!""...

Now next person facebook see ""Hey, actually arresting people this"" problem stopped issue. want protest, virtual protest sit write angry letters State Federal MP's till lockdown ends one way another. severe cases yes. people catch fine. panic shame.

One way trying reduce gene pool. wonder many people refuse wear face coverings hatred Muslim women wearing them. Muslim I'd laughing head right now. Children 10 lower risk.

&amp;#x200B;

Children 10 18 much risk spreading it. That's fine typically severe symptoms, like 1/3 education population risk, large portion population underlying conditions great comes COVID. problem students 10 MAJOR infection vector. point study test $200 box laser illuminate droplets. measured 1080p iPhone camera counted custom software.

There critical flaw study it‚Äôs cheapo camera. Never stopped Florida. local primary elections local elections work place spring, summer, soon fall. 

Bars shut changed model food stayed open. People food bars midnight ... lot drinks side. get I‚Äôm sure. sarcastic? point kid got covid kindergarten, there's definitely covid kids kindergarten soon more. Wow, TIL. thought measles rash fatigue. realize dangerous. poor police officer tries hard, yet keeps opening mouth incriminating self. people, interaction police, shut fuck say nothing till get legal representative. done work them, admitted crime, camera, shown lack remorse crime, resisted arrest (however mildly), failed comply lawful direction (to hand mobile devices). husband could equally arrested convicted police feeling extra angry couple offences.  

If police come knocking, even think know better, even think 'done nothing wrong', even 'enquiries related another individual', shut up. Well, that‚Äôs really works, no, probably not. I‚Äôve 6 different countries since March America country still lying people still can‚Äôt accept COVID won‚Äôt killing masses people. Exactly: Covid underlying cause. Without it, you‚Äôd still climbing mountain. 

Instead, Covid came along pushed worst possible spot fall, go. 

Covid‚Äôs fault, regardless whether snap half hitting rock terminal velocity, fall crevasse freeze death, take three weeks starve death: Covid killed you, even though died starvation. hypothermia. broken half. comment incomplete. Someone another thread said people fill death certificates tend different personal preferences whether state obvious not. one might put ""covid"" another say ""cardiac arrest caused covid"". Time constraints lack autopsy could factors choosing go detail. Let's crystal clear second homes, beach houses, landlords foreign domestic drastically drive price housing including rent led millions Americans forced renters life kids surf coaches go homeless. 

No minimum wage job America reasonably afford rent (30% monthly income) people work 2 jobs afford rent counting healthcare costs sudden bills. fact OP thread calls foul can't evict people **IN MIDDLE DEADLY PANDEMIC** insane. Yeah guess Israel's COVID outbreak never happened. Even that, happens *anyone* wants try open bank useful function? That‚Äôs location services. Apparently one doesn‚Äôt understand. r/Sino

LMAO reading news, probably lot better off. houses gonna magically disappear without landlords something? need stuff, especially now, mean taking tax money make everything free. one wanted children, people know fact going additional costs while. Yes people going difficulties financially, always going case everything can't keep taxing people equalize completely. I'd say pretty practical probably welcome start trials. saw Moderna, J&amp;J, Pfizer, others GIANT U.S. centric trials said, ""hey, want that."" 

Purely politics optics U.S. trials top list months ago began South Africa Brazil. Yeah pick prescription I'm drive now. ccp 50 cent army. Hello ????? SALONS CLOSED !!!! pretty dumb.. dad landlord tenants arnt paying rent.. like simply forgiven, debt accumulated.. soon timer runs out, people evicted well massive debt hanging really know many people survive.. dad lucky savings like every landlord backup Even large home passive income worth letting strangers house?
What happens they're type need evict. misunderstanding implied premise necessary leap ‚Äúchildren less severe cases‚Äù ‚Äúchildren lower priority vaccination‚Äù. yes, misunderstanding.

Recent research showing children important I've honestly seen LOT videos women freak outs wearing masks.

I wear mask believe lot CDC saying 92+% deaths preexisting conditions. Also 4-5 months in, got sick one family sick probably asymptomatic. 

In Chicago ONE wearing mask street seems like less less wearing stores workers.

I keep seeing notorious people stores mask hand case anyone calls out. people i've come across condo building elevator usually say ""my mask pocket."" see get elevator mine on. always seem scared, always tell big deal i'm wearing people freak out. agree, laugh go separate ways. 
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre analogous. Covid obviously quite contagious it‚Äôs even close Measles. example, Covid reasonably control UK quite time despite pubs restaurants open 2 months people fairly indifferent masks. effective vaccine job reduce sporadic isolated clusters, even though people refuse vaccinated. I'm ok I'm azoospermic welcome world followed rules, one one out, got pre-permission everyone involved. You‚Äôre idiot. virus wouldn‚Äôt last long pills, even coughed on. It‚Äôs ideal, it‚Äôs almost certainly problem. 

In terms lawsuits, way could prove contracted virus prescription. 

It‚Äôs coronavirus, anthrax. Misleading title. missed part can't. sell, tenant would evicted, can't happen now. basically owns thing he's allowed (by government) sell use. So, significantly reduce rather significant cause death U.S. still 200,000 excess deaths overall compared previous year. Problem range everyone died would died year nobody died would died year, +/= 100% deaths. Looking RI expected deaths, past years before, spiked deaths went back similar pattern before. They're also smaller sample size. Connecticut probably better example, may people staying home also skew statistics hard attribute whether people COVID die later simply smaller risks. hand, New York New Jersey huge spikes leveled back off, never dipped, first major outbreaks seen rubber band effect there.

What know whether deaths equal later. know deaths likely COVID rate match expected rate, even taper off, change fact probably COVID, even people would died later year still died COVID, knowing end lives early what's important whether ends months decades earlier. best metric probably year end total weekly anomalous data, like New York going 1500/week near 5000/week. anything, post-epidemic dips might skew data matching confirmed deaths possible deaths since round data back again. we're interested net sum, worst case, many deaths could attributed COVID. using RI, would sum week + bar, since RI seems trending average past years, readjust average (which seems around 20-30/week discrepancy) add weekly excess. Like said, even year averages back out, weeks likely COVID deaths. explains lot. Hopefully grow one day, kid. People go work sick viruses deadly get whole workplace sick. countries, polite wear mask sick prevent others getting sick. hope mask thing culture stays. Stuff getting sick common colds less scary illnesses too. found hand sanitiser smells nice 70% alc think passes. kids havent sick ages kinda nice. Nobody forced anything. they're happy working conditions they're free seek work elsewhere. Good. STAY FUCK INSIDE. economy worth life. hope locked-down 2022. This, correct. gives families (or case businesses), time prepare. Maybe thought forcing employees dangerous situations without understanding consequences first. published source code public seen experts amateurs alike checked safe regard. Finland, still respect privacy. also possible completely separate virus common cold, influenza, (not the) coronavirus.

Viruses everywhere always strong mutate together like monolith. hard notice usually vaccinated properly them, even vaccinations can't cover everything.  I'm sorry, Democrats threatened violence encouraged domestic terrorism? Sadly still swarming Ireland self isolating available? Looking hos comments history... ignore him. I‚Äôm drawing parallel financial crisis 2008. familiar words, article thats used """".

I agree you, color dress irrelevant. 365,000 people attended really. Even 1,000 got sick. numbers pretty low. I'm supporter event like this, numbers can't higher regular infection rates across country. baffles anyone believe anything 45 says. However willingness many people really behind excuse trivialize 180,000 dead human beings truly disgusting. Stupid people stupid regardless gender are. mixing ""criminalizing"" personal legal liability. one's charged crimes. don‚Äôt even gyms yet? That‚Äôs objectively far ‚Äúbusiness usual.‚Äù hell maybe business usual average redditor wish ‚Äúsnitching‚Äù wasn‚Äôt word people using.

Take example measles, caused virus around humans centuries. highly infectious ‚Äî R0 value 15.

This means average one child measles infect 15 others. result, around 95 per cent people need resistant disease population achieve herd immunity.

Most people recover measles infection produce good immune response protects rest life. yet, vaccination, measles common childhood disease.

**Each new generation children susceptible enough people naturally became resistant produce herd immunity.**

In 1930s, temporary herd immunity effect recorded one location US.

But exception, countries rolled universal measles vaccination programmes enabled come close eliminating disease.

Scientists think R0 value SARS-CoV-2 4 6, similar rubella virus. level vaccination needed produce herd immunity eliminate rubella 85 per cent."" Show source says people catch fine actual statistics. mentioned survival rate. 

Aside that, 1% death rate still pretty horrific. 300,000 US citizens 1% death rate would 3 million people. alright EXTRA 3 million people dropping dead year could've mitigated risk wearing masks keeping kids home? 

The school year chug along fine online awhile. Exposing children virus full understanding little protection answer. Initially panic, yeah, one knew severe would be. people careful. safe protecting problem? **Department Homeland Security** giving guidelines anyone except **Department Homeland Security**? pointed statements claiming I'm ignoring I'm agreeing them, times even directing earlier made point. seems like wishing speaking someone who's ""20% HIT settled science"" ""end interventions nothing"" bandwagon ignoring evidence contrary.

Sorry, could clarify distinction burnout threshold bringing back around historical data, look happened Florida. mobility gradually improved, pattern viral spread ""low, low, low, low, low, OMG everyone it"". ""low, low, rising, rising, rising, rising, peak, decline, decline"". Depend squint growth June August peak either gradual 50/50 blend convex/cave up, straight linear path. Mind transpired, posted above, mobility barely budged downwards.

When look Florida see basically flat low level infections March end May YYG's model. Then, increasing growth infections end May early June. mobility trends fall beginning March peak around end May, retrench little, much. Mobility increases set stage, speak, capped outbreak ceasing growth.

Yeah ok. Yes, big difference protests typically centrally organized planned significantly ahead time. problem people (like MIL) going event like Sturgis without mask, me, organizers irresponsible, especially nothing help people follow guidelines. goes double president. setting example everyone, skirting rules possible act like everything normal. 

Protests also tend end disperse, rather people staying together hotels going restaurants bars days end. There's also goals gatherings. Sturgis rnc entertainment (rnc necessary - people not). Protests communicating fellow citizens government. 

Obviously, marginal differences. really transformative. think matter.

In end, matter someone following health guidelines. problem regardless.

You look **how** spreads, evaluate risks versus costs (or supply) based that. matter ""slap best everyone else value lives"", matter ""these masks *specifically required* certain procedures, evidence shows make *no difference* average person situations"". 

This virus primarily spreads hand contact surfaces. mask, N95 otherwise, prevent teacher touching face absentmindedly. class children likely cover area germs usual, teachers going overexposed COVID regardless type mask wear. **This argument suggesting teachers worry put situations**. Personally think classes return point time likely premature places right now. better protect insisting increased hand washing implementations, something effect rather encouraging insisting valuable masks recommended.

Above, seem insist crowded space means teachers likely get virus, that's I'm claiming. argument ""teacher's get virus"", *evidence shows* specific mask, high demand medical field right now, offers minimal *any* benefits surgical mask, prioritized. *ever used*, criminalized, sought after. help you.

Also, I'm sorry comment came across combative. mean insult, inform. reasons may knowledgeable people, healthcare professional.

Anyway, think first hospital told covid turned positive test government? course fucking did. NEVER covid! common scenario really? Cases declined measures taken.

Measures taken, cases kept rising hit ""something"" cases started declining near zero. point ""something"" clearly related infection rates.. (as opposed new article fairly misleading confused. word ""herd immunity"" used mean several overlapping things. I'm using mean ""level immunity across population prevents disease spreading given society"". Clearly, Sweden level.

Yes, know that. However measures FAR softer US states still trying implement (cough, California). 

And context thread ""look-at-Sweden-success-we-need-to-lock-down-harder. Using first sentence link. ""Most people coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recover completely within weeks."" See word most?

Also seroprevalence may still underestimate immunity based two factors:

1. Seroprevalence snapshot time; antibody levels fall T-cell immunity persist;
2. Cross-immunity might reduce number severity infections, still occur while, themselves, nothing worry (just risk infecting others);

How yall like 2020 poem? Let's put perspective... amount infections Europe EU Europe double inhabitants compared US, yet Europe half (ish) infections.

That quarter infections take total inhabitants account (all back envelope calculations, exact would favour Europe)

Are idiots Europe? Absolutely! even get govern countries... Yes ""antimaskers"" Europe... results speak themselves. 

We point plenty done better... mean Netherlands ""trust citizens responsible""... Talking idiots. Yet allowed public transport without mask LAW. one idiot countries Europe. 

It saddens see US government allow idiots go rampant, see results Europe with, even consistent, regulations. Getting flu shot (which free btw) lowers R0 even more. I'd rather prepared prepared. think flu bad year due distancing, masks people practicing better hand hygiene. exactly ‚Äúnot trust‚Äù? get vaccine protect everyone else. can‚Äôt stay away literally anyone might compromised. Drop DM info.... I'll snitch shit them. absolutely large extent. see downtown condos Portland. got dad apartment. somewhat cheaper usual much. way kept price (it lower riots corona really hurting business) offering 2 months free rent. way economy gets better, right away start increasing prices like crazy it‚Äôs already higher amount is.

People option staying away then. Short term profits Long term survival. company incentized think quarter going next year's, decade now. force change via law else they'll never it. 

It even stupidity, short term first way shareholders therefore businesses run. Reading news constantly exhausting depressing. Limit outside exposure essential trips. Wear mask, wash clothes get home disinfect phone, wallet etc. That's do. Exactly. compare Australia to.. Taiwan, certainly mainland China. 180,000 days ago?  chance competent, science driven response administration little. Roads form travel kills most, miles driven dipped briefly, Leary‚Äôs per mile went up. Potentially alcohol consumption went 55 Whoa, hold phone, report viral loads daily numbers there? 

Also, I'm curious censorship. Go that, censored?  New York government currently forcibly holds millions Uyghurs concentration camps.

Just 'saying, research claim, instead idiotically gullible gobbling mass media.

Start looking methodology used obtain ""million"" number, who, motive funding (hint: Adrian Zenz).

You might even surprised learn blindly accepted fact without actually checking it.  moratorium evictions doesnt anything. tells HUD look solution. People age always say, *‚ÄùI‚Äôll fine get it.‚Äù* don‚Äôt know long term effects I‚Äôll pass getting even survive initial infection. Seriously, least 5 posts China starting emergency use vaccines country, bad miss all, good time praying horrible death. Buying second property necessity, privilege. Since government need fund privileged ventures? like bait switch, money hungry people got raping poor via housing costs crying foul deal consequences. entitled leeches society. live 20 minutes sturgis. Never attended rally coworkers supervisors choose to. Niceee. late Fauci fake agenda failing like attempts BLM riots Lol u losing polls despite u tried global pandemic riots. Yes. Simply yes. remember, 1 car crash found misattributed COVID 7 cases found computer error categorized. 

So, 8 cases total wrongly claimed COVID. rest accurate. bad weren‚Äôt fetuses, Republicans would definitely make sure masks. got called back office second moved stage four. reason it, whatever. Today someone works near called due sick testing positive. He'd actually sick since last week kept coming got test results today. I'm waiting wondering symptoms hit bad they'll be. hope right, worth pointing people inclined ignore advice experts dismiss science people who'll refuse listen anyone replaces current administration. people listen experts trust science already should. best new potus stop actively making things worse, twitter facebook memes still keep misinformation flowing weak-minded obstructionism may hinder efforts improve situation. I'm generally pessimistic last months dimmed view chances. Geaux tigers Yeah sure get that. Either way idiotic act COVID + valid COVID deaths. thought cases insinuated underlying condition. get want focus stats currently helpful agenda, wrong. Stats hospitalizations aggregated level disaster HHS fiasco. Deaths basically reliable indicator been. Unfortunately lags month, find late stop anything. Positivity next reliable relative measure calculate normalized trends adjusting quantity tested. order respond outbreak, absolute values important finding hotspots explode.  Nice Shoot, people get mad park front house PUBLIC STREET. parking spot, park there. reopen schools find eh? never thought people could misunderstand way first read news. Wonder intentionally misinterpreted stupidity really knows bounds. Yes, virus. US trust people careful? Maybe some. I'm going get flu shot. starting sound lot like nationalism, can't get behind mindset. 6% death rate. would bad, 20,000,000 USA. Bodies would piled gutters.

9,000 DEATHS COVIDv alone. rest sick, old, obese people. would die next year year. Tell families 190,000+ Americans died COVID hundreds thousands sickened - may carry disease's effects life. many cases positive. Based read, US would use data countries long trial done well plenty precedent past. Coming next: Schools don‚Äôt want teenage daughter get pregnant won‚Äôt let use pregnancy test. Phew us like varying degrees. Tsunami hit Asia killed 200,000 people thought ""damn, that's sad"" went day minutes later. people impacted areas probably reacted similarly.

The truth is, much empathy expended equally, I'd stock 10am every day. none people health conditions would died? believe this? university holds national record right now? clearly Ontario probably Canadian. Educate yourself:

Rob Ford mayor Toronto famously caught tape smoking crack denigrating minorities smoking crack minorities. brother Doug currently Premier Ontario seriously screwing back school program amongst many issues including health care. also repeatedly linked drug dealing formative years. Well maybe actual point instead pointing obvious contrarian point view without substance support people might receptive. 

We even close end even confident either way probably ever know definitively would 'right' course action. 

As relevant article i'd bet lot increase malnourishment numbers would Asia, probably coming lockdown India particular. bit dumb article state people might die malnourishment increase virus India took number measurements lower affect virus. Whose say malnourishment increased virus deaths would dramatically higher well. population density India's economic centers insane could lead much dire scenarios fronts.

But sure sure try think critically complain people think comments add anything greater discussion. Hopefully tested negative become superspreaders. surprised Sturgis rally contribute 250 cases toll. helpful, thankyou give staff faculty aren‚Äôt young people. Like actually use fucking brain. hate conservatives know baseline information can‚Äôt process anything beyond that. American education system ruined critical think thinking wonder white liberals wildly unsuccessful unhappy afraid ever realize people like that. maybe introspect little figure why?

Not care, wondering. stay like good me, competitive advantage all. Shockedpikachu.jpg Lately whenever I've heard eviction moratoria, I've wondered happens property becomes foreclosed anyway? December, possibility someone laid 13 March gone 9 straight months without paying rent/mortgage. banks still going foreclosure proceedings cases? Say resident calls bank March tells laid due company closing down, get job months later enough pay utilities mortgage, vice versa. eviction likely winter even moratorium extended 2021? banks allowing mortgages left unpaid &amp; months tacked onto end loan? What's really going 'on ground', speak? article doesn‚Äôt even mention idk headline. Thanks asking. Yes, students staff required wear masks. Students may remove masks designated mask breaks lunch classrooms. understand students need mask breaks certain points, it‚Äôs like virus takes timeout scheduled breaks....

Anyways, ventilation. greatest concern since beginning reopening planning June. building built 60‚Äôs central system. Cooling done window units classroom heating done radiators. aren‚Äôt allowed run air conditioners, windows must open, school purchased exhaust fans windows.

If you‚Äôre infected asymptomatic, don‚Äôt COVID-19. 

You COVID-19 infected. 

Most COVID-19 cases infected. 

Learn difference two ask certain people group misleading people swapping words. dont tally

They like detailed rundown every single case contracted cases been. contact tracing pretty epic. One lady went like mall several shops caught contacts. 

Well that‚Äôs set 30 day reminder, time seemed insistent would continue, sure wouldn‚Äôt Honestly people country dont deserve man. They‚Äôll care soon enough. Seems like high likelihood long term health effects survivors.

This going wreck social security Medicare even faster projected last year.

When people‚Äôs checks get cut taxes go pay something could prevented noticed. Yes recorded covid deaths, segment died 3 months ago, many would died causes. modelling based letting virus rip/doing nothing. So, point disingenuous. less predicted lot countries taking extreme measures protect people. also 6 months in. Lol YUP SURE CAN. Texas hell UK phase 3 trials started July, likely done much sooner. results come sooner, used gain regulatory approval US need wait study done? fact even needs explanation someone doesn‚Äôt trust CCP laughable similar CDC 6% Right? would've waited November, MINIMUM told day dude kids white moms afraid virus afraid virus. must know zero kids lmao. Trump tweet death toll zero soon Fauci goes sleep tonight. isn't. first place, billions people thing, there's got reason. second, we're ants colony. nature limited empathy. NH right next door Massachusetts 100% indoor dining COVID spike Massachusetts still open state. restaurants border Massachusetts always 50% patrons Massachusetts. seem follow new case death curves. numbers go up, disappear. numbers go down, come full force. guess learn childhood Bible football really don‚Äôt good grasp numbers science. actually helping people? trials showcase did. ""helps"" might've done anything, much way remdesivir actually provide miraculous recovery. It‚Äôs ‚Äúbreakneck speed‚Äù saw spike early July late July seemed thin would continue exceed pace. time, 30 days ago, fairly clear Denmark done good contact tracing 54 initial cases putting measures together limit impact incident. still, let know number new cases per day exceed Sweden‚Äôs, guess well ten years

26 84 growth 223%, 320%. 

Let‚Äôs cover percent growth measured

Going 26 52 100% growth

Going 26 78 200% growth

Going 26 104 300% growth

Going 26 110 323% growth Look (referring attempts discredit such. I'm Fauci's side) Yes. They're tired winning yet! many countries got right

You may want take another look. Even South Korea issues right now. Also, countries aren‚Äôt divided 50 pieces 50 different people controlling pieces. wouldn‚Äôt work. prohibition didn‚Äôt work, wouldn‚Äôt either.

Instead, need focus newer smokers, it‚Äôs late prevent current addicts. high blood pressure, take medication it""

But feel you. grandfather fucking pacemaker, multiple heart attacks now, blood thinners, borderline diabetic, overweight, 70 grandmother consider ""not really risk"" category. convince grandmother go cross-country road trip earlier summer 2x cancer survivor. 

People feel comforted thinking they're picture health, guess. I've wondering, many people opportunity reinfected? Unless hits community pretty hard two times, maybe opportunity there.

I guess healthcare workers (specifically treating covid patients without adequate PPE) likely reinfected. Pretty low.  deep son. Trump fucked up. Encouraged states open early. Held rally, masks. Dead Herman Cain. 180 thousand plus dead Americans. citizens banned entering rest world. would take remove blinders? Serious question."
