Let's move   It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre smartest crowd. live Arkansas. governor signed legislation banned mask mandates. looking sending young children school fall completely defenseless. sooo feel frustration! absolutely infuriating selfish others are. I'm like cares work. one masking ""all"" vaccinated!!! 75% aren't. pandemic heck spread long ""back normal!!"" Infuriating!!! üò° like nobody saw happened Texas said ""Look us first state reopen. Everyone said we're gonna anyways!"" disabled person bad immune system, pandemic really shown people view important view life lol   done, agree. However there‚Äôs lot grey area comes making people take vaccine that‚Äôs EUA. University California seems public education institution that‚Äôs requiring vaccines policy hasn‚Äôt finalized one sued proposal yet. guarantee lot Anti-Vax parents sue K-12 Schools follow suit Next one Vietnam vaccinated. sure point is. makes clickbait fear mongering? numbers UK young people long COVID follows: 13,000 kids aged 2-11 years, 20,000 kids aged 12-16 years, 71,000 young people aged 17-24 bad outcome. true though. City almost Democrat vaccination rate lower Republican counties state. purely educated vs non educated battle. continue false narrative much solve problem.  agree this. Back peak 200,000 new cases, little immunity vaccines newly authorized. Now, half people fully vaccinated, don‚Äôt see us ever getting levels again.   risking life? stupidity selfishness modern conservative always amazes me. Cambodia luck following rather unique location/population centre based vaccination strategy. started vaccinations certain geographic areas. First (the capital) Phnom Penh, around 95% adult people vaccinated. provincial cities (Kandal, Koh Kong &amp; Sihanouk) following within days achieving numbers. think strategy worked well Cambodia, relative large rural population (less risk contagion), young population (avg. age around 24).

Around 8.5M vaccine doses administered all, total adult population around 10M. Also vaccine grown moth cells really seem check boxes mRNA He's kind troll something. He's posted comment several times.  Well none ""approved""

I guess said ""available today"" per question Hopefully schools every state thing. didn't, well toss clink. Look fruit vegetable consumption low state. seem everything make sure short life.  Delta northeast quite while... also 80% vax rate  It‚Äôs dumb question. I‚Äôve read original virus replaced fit variants. I‚Äôll see find article. Yes, lot kids get military also problems. guess comment really specify hint towards that, though would loved wear mask time teenager. Way better getting bullied acne braces. fuck posting exact comment everywhere? It‚Äôs even profound good, give rest  No. all. least many Europen countries robust social democracies. issue intelligence, different education.

Lower income people likely believe conspiracy theories virus, less likely get vaccinated likely flaunt rules. Think probably closer 60% Delta now. long 100% things keep trending such.   mean? confronting skepticism head months now. One issues Missouri lack strong push state officials vaccination. It‚Äôs late variant already spreading start fighting skepticism. find necessary turn everything something political. country something good. Can't happy that.  me.  Glad country could help yours.     Whoosh    may dumb question wondering, ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù covid virus still delta variant now? It‚Äôs much worse now. don‚Äôt like vets, like fellow Trump cult worshippers.

This also NYC worse initial wave compared west coast initial waves. Different strains. vaccinated?  told vaccines start wear six months, fully vaccinated people still get sick *and* pass on.

This exactly news wanted hear full sixteen months in, true, false, somewhere between? one single state issue. Children never good vector risk population COVID.

If group adults unvaccinated would associated spike. Doesn‚Äôt come charging block holdover weren‚Äôt enough medical staff. course n95‚Äôs work better. It‚Äôs always airborne. much contagious now. proof this? theory impact?

I figure samples could probably examined. But, news me. Lol get vaccinated Stupid people hurt lot people too. Making new variants overrunning hospitals others don‚Äôt get care need respect opinion. Still. cannot allow people force others will. unable vaccinate must stay healthy. alternative methods combat sickness.  I'm 100% ok that. Maybe we'll get failed states revert unincorporated worse. Revert back territories they'll unliveable. one making anything. Vaccines optional. I'm happy beta test little safer. would expected raise last 18 months. can't believe many still there.  Stupid Stupid does. bit Germany link wrong though. 59% cases Delta variant Germany end June, variant thought (mostly) dominant middle July - according RKI (German Federal Agency disease control prevention). fare widespread source leads believe. It‚Äôs insane. company also record breaking year productivity employee morale per surveys keep yet top level management ‚Äúis tracking dynamic fluid situation return work‚Äù 

So you‚Äôre watching major competitors don‚Äôt lose labor bring us back places stay remote? Hahah There's already 2 American strains somewhere 12-15 total mutated strains OG virus. really force anyone maybe start making people show card enter places. want get vaccinated start cutting everywhere. would nice media outlets specify deaths weren‚Äôt vaccinated. could really help push fact even getting shot important. Working home still working ffs. teachers taught elearning schools anyways. I‚Äôm tired teachers shit many. party taking seriously. Sure Trump mocking seriousness first, spent millions towards research, planning, got vaccine rollout started Biden came in. vaccinated March '21, healthy young adult made decision based scientific facts, little bit trust. extremely moderate align either party.


Misinformation spread (thanks social media) lack education blame, political affiliations. Oh well. Darwinism. Yeah kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated year, going bad  focus vaccinating rest world first ffs Delta+ also bit leg room officially, masks mostly protect others you, way around.  Personal safety. like lungs weak heart 10 years road guys handle scaling back extra activities one year. want live another 30 years least I'm guessing also one year risk ton health issues road ? whole thing mismanaged day one gotten is. Go read Spanish Flu people listen basically made mistakes now. History really repeat laugh us 60 years road probably pull crap.  tell ICU nurse Covid unit experience Delta much worse. initial fatality rate December around 20% vented patients. it‚Äôs closer 60% higher percentage end vent. would floor walkie/talkie types really sick ones. floor patients ending ICU. I‚Äôm Alabama seeing mostly Delta now. country‚Äôs inoculation program, meanwhile, slow recent weeks. total 15.5 million people, 30.4 percent country‚Äôs 51.3-million population, received first shots COVID-19 vaccines, remaining almost unchanged 29.8 percent tallied KDCA said 5.8 million people fully vaccinated, accounting 11.4 percent population.

Why vaccination slow? anti-vaxx big problem SK? 

I hope keep together increase vaccinations quickly right SK literal tinderbox delta variant. Shitty human nature. Rugged individualism great society. like people around world starving, people eat many calories (while poor), find inefficient, wasteful ways making food.

Unsurprising got point. point let Darwinism play out. It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre draining shallow end gene pool. Deaths running ten percent previous deaths per case due vaccines atm, current spike showing first signs slowing get second wind clubs opening soon, guess would likely top 150 deaths day worse case assuming case peak ends similar last time. Masks pretty much voluntary anyway, people still working home largely want continue least time people choosing whatever social distancing comfortable regardless rules, can't see big reopening making much difference save clubs, cause ahugh jump numbers mostly affect young also read died two different strains covid. think woman UK happened to. Alpha isn‚Äôt even OG. original Wuhan strain, one hit US/Italy/Europe March 2020, common B117/Alpha became dominant winter strains emerging too, like Beta South Africa, Gamma Brazil, although Alpha mostly outcompeted (although Epsilon hasn‚Äôt totally wiped, Beta mostly has). also NY CA variants (forget letters) seemed stay regionally confined, still mostly outcompeted Alpha.

Now Delta becoming dominant, variants still around. state showing % sequenced 4-week periods, it‚Äôs pretty easy see changes. 6-12 months expect average IQ states rise prior baseline‚Ä¶ works great, world 5 year old. hate country.

Yes, morning got first dose Pfizer. Thank much Except children never significant vectors victims COVID  That's good  absolutely does, don‚Äôt focus death / serious illness alone. given kids healthy can‚Äôt get bed shower, it‚Äôs detriment don‚Äôt acknowledge long covid well.  sure I‚Äôm clear timeline here, exposed day got shot, tested positive shortly after? 

No wonder feel icky. That‚Äôs throwing lot immune system once! Stay well hydrated, rest up, monitor symptoms. get high fever, start seeing blue gray tint nailbeds, difficulty breathing, seek medical attention. 

You‚Äôll likely fine. young otherwise healthy, lowers risks lot. feel better within week. 

There‚Äôs lot don‚Äôt understand yet Long Covid, wouldn‚Äôt worry yet. vaccinated seems reduce chances, even improve symptoms people already it. You‚Äôve got non-standard timing there, it‚Äôs rare begin with. You‚Äôll likely feel better time next week. 

Sorry you‚Äôre sick. see criticism fits mentioning chemical warfare trying restart rural Columbians. Israel jumped fast struggling orthodox community refusing vaccination. Coincidentally surge cases well. lungs... reread article. purely mask wearing. don‚Äôt understand point. reiterate? Sorry. like first part Good grief stupid selfish. whole ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù argument nonsense. research behind vaccine dates back 10 years. 

It‚Äôs also mortality. People get lingering side effects. 

The world would better place could achieve herd immunity move on. You‚Äôre selfish arguments drawing everyone else.  Yup! doesn‚Äôt care lethal not. go teach summer school bunch unmasked kids stuffy room can‚Äôt open windows in. Press f. far important factor. Compare high uptake northern Europe trust state health service much stronger. double-dosed figures. Unlike earlier variants, unfortunately delta really needs 2nd dose significant protection vs infection.

If Canada far chain, older age groups must lower take-up rates (given overall 1st dose % UK, 2nd dose bit behind). careful tinderbox. It‚Äôs nice ideal strive you‚Äôre thinking implications.

Do wear seatbelt refrain drinking driving? Soon followed lots people saying wish vaccinated. get whole bunch people ‚Ä¶ trust vaccine them. Ok. ‚òùÔ∏èü§¨ arguing US point view.

Social differences much smaller Switzerland US. E.g. rich poor shop grocery stores. number sick days (which 6 months i'm mistaken), health insurance use hospitals.

Ghettos like see US (black areas, trailer parks, tent cities streets) nonexistent Switzerland. Sure, still separation rich ""poor"" live, neither far apart fundamentally different resources have.

Not mention working social welfare system, captures people hit hard times.  south rise again! Covid‚Ä¶  1 10 recovered illness. 1 every 10 cases. vast majority cases mild/asymptomatic. 

And lingering symptom long covid. Long covid something much severe rare

1 10 patients means hospitalized severe enough disease patients hospital. UK, confirm. still speculation even around, know prevalent many areas.    sad GPs saying over-60s well wait vaccines lying fridges expiring could've used another country someone really needs it.  don‚Äôt wish death perse, think could brush covid(or possibly chicken-pox) wake-up scare. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs probably thing would convince daughter get booster shots(afraid needles-has always pinned procedure paed said she‚Äôs old) Haven‚Äôt even approached topic covid yet.

Stupid-yes. Absolutely miserable experience-yes. sure knocked bit sense me. would think trying keep everybody alive worst pandemic several genesis would also ""popular"" move, yet are. someone Vietnam. say anything Sino name viewed suspiciously Asian community. 

It matter science says. country origin hated. People willing use it. Bet Damn, 20x spike 10 days makes recent Indian spike look like amateur hour   Spike would done dusted week Euro 2020.  madness! really worried Dad lives N. L.R. 81. Winter going interesting.  true measure ""disaster"" hospital admissions, would say. Disaster healthcare overwhelmed people die normally would receive adequate, live-saving medical care (including people sick Covid, ""crowded out"" Covid patients).

The dashboard also tracks hospital admissions. lag detections infection, far, five days infection surge began, admissions actually declining. Folks? Vote people local office want spend schools. seeing south result school systems financially neglected. fully vaccinated planned go see family Arkansas. However, health insurance sure going now. live nearly 77% people vaccinated. Arkansas god, get it. 50% UK used AstraZeneca vaccine also less effective compared mRNA vaccines. importantly, study also found elevated inflammatory markers regardless whether person serious mild case disease. proteins blood associated conditions affecting circulatory system risk factor cardiovascular disease.'

Singapore's one first countries study long COVID patients. Educate smaller studies show 1 3 patients COVID developed long COVID symptoms. OP's link dashboard another graph: hospital admissions. actually stable going down. surge cases five days old, yet sign leading worrying increase hospital admissions. bet moment, explicitly UK, number cases matter much vulnerable vaccinated. I'm sure ""ablist"", ""vaccinatedist"". 

I hope able get vaccinated.  game majority people want pre-pandemic lifestyle. Even Delta. first stories eradication possible appeared March 2020. eventually cause mutation kill harm everyone. 

This total bullshit (I see anywhere article, either). know possible nightmare scenario could occur even deadlier variant emerges escapes immunization. mean going happen. even mean remotely likely happen. make sound like eventuality, inevitability. 

There like 5 major variants covid since beginning - UK one, UK double-mutant, South African one, Brazil one, Delta India. Every single one variants produced massive amounts handwringing hemming hawing sub we're starting now, going cause another surge, everyone's gonna die, etc. vaccines (especially pfizer moderna) proven overwhelmingly effective every single one, panic crowd methodically moves onto next. far I'm concerned, variants already beat vaccine, there's evidence escape super-variant be. Real world evidence. that's even mention shit ton random variants significant also beaten vaccine.  one wants AZ OZ. waiting Pfizer. GPs go way discourage patients wait. many unvaccinated. Variants. people cannot get vaccinated. people Uno compromised.

Maybe OK previous variants, could create issues Delta. saving grace seems like people test lot non-official quick covid sites, maybe limiting infection rates. Since Delta appeared scientists saying virus become endemic.

Even 70% vaccination virus isnt going away. herd immunity may possible more. course eventually people protection severe outcomes, people still get (mildly) sick, like common flu Primary transmission vector ‚â† transmission vector.

Public transport going become super spreading site sooner later.  No, vaccines give much stronger protection particularly second shot (J&amp;J excluded)  Unfortunately new Delta variant.

Prior infection provide good protection reinfection Delta variant (according Dutch CDC)

Firstly, personally think *death* COVID unnecessarily over-applied broader audience. course, *have* examples younger people dying, though they're extremely rare, especially compared certain age group/health condition, happen - course, purposely fear mongering right.

But death thing worry about. trouble I've people know they're confident they'll survive COVID. Sure, probably will, survival everything. Long COVID/damage recovery shown occur, (naturally would never know effects *later)* think that's hugely important. Plus, COVID puts work two weeks, perhaps longer. could put co-workers work. puts yours/theirs family members (who may also working/at school) risk/out work/school. And, time passes, there's chance mutation.

Quick note - we've four mutations since beginning, one rather nasty. I'm expert means, try use common sense best ability can, that's *four* mutations *with* supposedly lockdown/distancing/PPE applications. normal? know mutations crazy higher lethality, that's still good. know advocating restrictions lifted, reiterate lesser dangers...

But vaccine - right information great come by, muddled/messy (note personally think *incompetence* rather maliciousness - politicians fucking dumb).

That said, think one way look risk management. know well *really* hard continue restrictions. personally zero issue average person probably wants life back. world need continue, people need work.

So, first, comes initially commented (about vs that). agree, never bully people taking something - given information, clear possible, make decision. (Note I've seen bullying countries felt pressure read everything can't say does/doesn't exist.) long restrictions forced place? Again, I'm happy buckle continue average person probably isn't.

Then comes vaccine. First, understand, mRNA worked 50 odd years? I'm way immunologist/science whiz (maybe tell) *some* indication knowledge could happen? Perhaps right, I'm happy say know, *could* side effects damaging future, surely know COVID *will be* opposed maybe/hopefully smaller chance vaccine going bad.

Bottom line, understand, nip bud (if still considered bud nipped.) often COVID passed, likely it'll mutate. vaccine older/at risk patients, COVID *still* passed without like ever growing hot potato. may risk initially, like said, death rates crazy low low ages, that's *this* *these* current variants.

In perfect world, we'd like NZ. pretty damn good job. that's island, small one, world perfect. Would think *maybe* imperfect solution *most definitely* imperfect world?

I'm sorry that's place. ever want push vaccine want imply COVID bad. Information best people make decisions. make great points, complicated. said, think vaccine help prevent death/illness - get world back running, even means taking risk - *a lot* world sadly wait. point ones getting sick mostly ones anti-vax? mean say fuckem? Pfizer working antiviral pill China responsible mess, Soviets polluted much anyone.

[Here‚Äôs Governor‚Äôs shared info couple days ago:

  ‚ñ™Ô∏è 99.4% new COVID-19 cases
  ‚ñ™Ô∏è 99.0% COVID-19 hospitalizations
  ‚ñ™Ô∏è 99.3% COVID-19 deaths

  data clear‚ÄîCOVID-19 vaccines work.

  Get vaccinated protected: That's media stereotype hippies is. reality every group decent people shitty fanatics find parts ideology shoehorn selfishness to. 

While hippies sat field listening Hendrix hugging other, Charles Manson's hippy commune trying start race war. It‚Äôs depressingly human thing. brain body react information challenges world view like physical threat. you‚Äôve spent years building whole identity around one person like unto god, you‚Äôre never going want admit wrong whole sense self shift.

Since late 2019, learned lot virus variants/strains, still enough long-term data. issue anti-vaxxers cherry picking numbers. paper simply reporting preliminary numbers, 826 pregnancies. amount completed pregnancies either birth, abortion, miscarriages.

Right data fields see total 2846 women participating received first dose either first second trimester. 

So, 2782 women miscarry receiving first dose time writing. would actually place vaccinated women well national average miscarriages.

However, would expect women miscarry final percentage 10-20%, would national average.  Lol People seem understand Sinovac reading posts upset. 3 vaccines thing one year seems... lot

It just... isn't? quite long list vaccinations (a side effect lot fieldwork remote parts world). quite need several shots space one year - rabies (yes, rabies - vaccinating people rabies recommended travel places lot free-ranging dogs) salient example. 2 protocols rabies vaccination one get Poland day 1, day 7 either day 21 28 (i.e. 3 doses space month), booster year boosters according results blood antibody tests least every 5 years. haha right on, thanks! yeah rabbit holes... i've learned much random stuff way.. probably also get enough sleep ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø think that's over-generalization. almost surety prior infection grants certain level immunity. see, certainly 100%, say 0% equally foolish.  Yep. annoyed home, eating ice cream watching trashy daytime tv also infected boyfriend, who's completely asymptomatic. 

She's hospital. So, need get damn vaccine. somebody maybe explain vaccine usefull covid antibodies? 

And come antibodies never taken account speaking heard immunity? possibly could pre-travel testing going UK order get visas prepped, etc.  Literally nothing article says wasn't. tested positive despite continually showing zero symptoms. Get bandwagon. world needs administer 30 billion doses per year foreseeable future. thing even possible? Literally nothing article says wasn't. tested positive despite continually showing zero symptoms. Get bandwagon.

Man, journalism really difficult journalists.  like assholes. Everybody‚Äôs got 1.5???

How get 1.5 sample size? people assholes others. evidence anyone mutation decrease CV virulence? idea gets kicked around past flu pandemics, we've seen new CV variant worse last terms transmissibility virulence. agree new mRNA vaccine tech awesome, huge problem distributing administering them. fix problem, CV continue circulate mutate globally. says immunity comparable vaccine tested. doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs comparable long vaccine. Reinfectjon rare doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything people gotten infected somewhat recently. Time mutations make reinfectjon common, less. Relying (re)infection, rolling dice permanent organ damage, immune response stupid. study finds immunity provided vaccines longer lasting infection. 

You said vaccine isn‚Äôt effective 6 months. don‚Äôt know heard that, it‚Äôs definitely true.

If you‚Äôve infected still get vaccine. Mandating isn‚Äôt bad idea. Almost fully recovered now. thank vaccine. isnt delta. One day next, suddenly everyone stopped wearing masks supermarkets etc. shocked literally went everyone noone wearing masks day netherlands. data isn‚Äôt personal like anecdotal evidence though. doesn‚Äôt affect people way unfortunately. People see 1% fatality rate (or whatever now) many can‚Äôt intuit means macro level. go ‚ÄúI‚Äôll probably fine.‚Äù Without constantly forced confront it, willfully ignore whole pandemic. Ive heard get delta variant vaccine, it‚Äôs much less severe vaccine stop stupidity Don‚Äôt mutations generally mean less deadly? Honest question. Trump got vaccinated. response that? think forced? Brexit blessing matter time locked see cringey commercials staying inside! Looking Frontier real, asymptomatic detected PCR I'd hardly call ""a Covid case""

It seems testing like helpful. Statistically yes, saying ""breakthrough case"" useless opinion. Yes, that's what's happened Vietnam well, largely back outbreak Yes, total around 1132 women vaccinated first trimester (which dangerous period miscarriage wise). probably close (probably miscarriages 2nd trimester group too) 104 miscarriage normal miscarriage rate. Lmao what? lost ur mind, seek help. child u good arguments, good look. Also, dual citizen. nearly bad pre-vaccine days. 

Back then, people refused wear masks got sick, health care workers vaccine risk getting sick trying save lives. Sinovac virtually ended Covid-19 Brazilian city managed vaccinate almost inhabitants. 2 thirds capacity. 60k fans rather 90k. LOL. Biden wants get re-elected, going mess Florida. would zero support kind move. flu. comparison worthless even viruses. CV results many presymptomatic asymptomatic infections virus transmitted spreader even knows sick. latency infection transmission, zero selection pressure reduce virulence, unlike flu, symptoms transmission tightly linked. specifically, exponential growth big multiplier. R value delta high. think vaccines hoax...you might redneck. treatment really change scenario, lowers deaths infected afford treatment.  Covid long haulers actually report symptom relief getting vaccinated. take worth. Wait what?

I thought natural immunity almost good vaccine. quite twist. personally love Ozarks. beautiful area, though I'm Johnson Shut-Ins girl myself.

I Branson since kid hear grown exponentially. local? many people think funnel there?  imagine cases two weeks. reasons experts say people getting vaccine Arkansas varied.

No, they're not. reason vaccination rate deeper parts south 30-40% 60-70% parts country. based stats COVID number one killer US last year.

Did read link? 2020, 690k died heart disease, 600k died cancer, 345k died covid.

Your dumbass literally said covid killed cancer heart disease traffic accidents combined. even know say that, except maybe learn states mentioning, shockingly big proportion folks vaccinated.

In Florida (the state mentioned), 90%+ people 65 older least one dose. half adults fully vaccinated. That's higher UK. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

But everything free sure hell would lot easier save money! So‚Ä¶it‚Äôs vaccine? Noted. now?  lifted almost month ago June 15th. 

For it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm LA, stores whatnot still require masks. Restaurants bars, much. world bigger US. It‚Äôs far many parts world. Many experiencing multiple waves. Vaccines readily available many due money lack supply. Depends‚Ä¶ could play hardball deny federal aid Florida see happens. Florida hospital systems making lot money covid billing federal government. It‚Äôs effectively stimulus program governor taking advantage.

Make states pay see happens. Florida‚Äôs current rate they‚Äôd need add income tax manage it.  said strictly help alone, think would work much better unvaxxed much single shot efficacy different vaccines? Dude, proved point knowing statistics work. that's proportional based stats COVID number one killer US last year. states mentioning, shockingly big proportion folks vaccinated. Also, unvaccinated folks becomes greater vaccinated COVID spread. highly encourage read book homie, watching friends cutting carrot stick. expected antivaxx people suddenly rush get vaccinated wear mask beyond stupid. county 50% 1+ vaxxed, signs store say wear mask vaccinated 10% actually covering face holes. add up. right is, ask Mexico! Singapore‚Äôs well-documented COVID19 experience also one extremely low death rate, part disease concentrated younger group construction workers. seropositives Indonesia also mostly 40s. Incorrect Mobility also lot lower 20s. people barely travelled 5 miles house. also aircon keep virus alive heat summer. Dumbest decision ever heard. Avoid Uk much current research shows vaccinated, Delta variant isn‚Äôt super dangerous safe right now.

If struggling mental health right now, I‚Äôd say turn news: watch twice week stay informed, don‚Äôt get worked boosters yet. highly doubt we‚Äôll get concrete information whether boosters needed Fall.

I think media playing threat level desperate attempt get anti-vaxxers Covid deniers least get vaccinated blowing precautions year. Covid-19 literally ‚Äútype‚Äù virus flu. They‚Äôre capsid type viruses. Nope. totally made whole thing up. got me, troll 1. end world 2023 cost million deaths-Brutal truth 1
2. going exposed virus unless live like hermits -Brutal truth 2

As long vaccinated effective vaccine symptoms range mild case severe flu. next years multiple treatments treat severe symptoms like loss smell/taste lung scarring. late 2022 reach equilibrium state testing/vaccine proof normalized international travel, nasal sprays, antivirals booster shoots pharmacies needed So, source? delta community? Dude look death stats US they're much higher combined. 

[Well according this, 345k people died covid US 2020. 3 million people died something cancer deaths covid. heart disease.


And course there's quite people US vaccinated covid. Especially demographics susceptible covid. deaths orders magnitude lower going forward.

In short, ever get tired wrong? They‚Äôre posting Fox News guy saying half UK covid deaths variant, vaccinated people. So, good luck sourh It‚Äôs ‚Äúsafe enough‚Äù long time, schools long time without significant spread. We've tried everything enough people cooperating.

Lockdowns, social distancing, masks, vaccines... nope. People still letting virus spread.

This going sound horrible, maybe let go. Let everyone get sick possibly die - slow direction headed towards to.

With low vaccinated areas bursting infections, virus mutated... vaccinated could well get sick. curious. able go Australia non-citizens borders closed. thought citizens only, emigrating ATM Thats true, odds complications Covid vaccinated low worry about. Going Florida fall season waning vaccine doesn‚Äôt sound like smart move. I‚Äôll take booster. no, don‚Äôt expect American government pay it. I‚Äôm happy pay myself. someone link said mixing vaccines different companies? I‚Äôm seeing posts pop everywhere none context. Id like read transcript view actual video.

Edit: Reddit posts brief news ‚Äúarticles‚Äù one final, stats mentioned NHS show way that. even close 40 year olds. won‚Äôt neutralise delta. at-risk group got double whammy producing enough antibodies weaker effectiveness Delta. difference full approval EUA data long-term effectiveness vaccine. course, first trial participants start dropping dead tomorrow big problem full approval, everything know tells us that's impossible.

In normal times, important know long vaccine lasts, need plan booster later needed. pandemic, really matter; deal emergency over.  concepts often conflated (and post simplicity)

Asymptomatic: People infected, never develop symptoms

Presymptomatic: People infected, stage virus develop symptoms (as in, symptoms time, develop point).

The challenge COVID (unlike many diseases) contagious asymptomatic presymptomatic states. means, even idea it, still perfectly capably spreading it. makes super dangerous, even population vigilant staying home first sign possible symptoms, still spread pretty far. also means less selective pressure mortality, unless increased mortality shortens pre-symptomatic phase disease (which necessarily true). Damn telling people pre-vaccine? Good were! Well small gains efficacy always worth multiplication argument (n unmasked equivalent 1 unvaccinated), let anyone take J&amp;J mRNA available, insist everyone wear n95 rather surgical cloth possible, etc. far points makes social significance moral worth masking, reject line reasoning that's much longer refutation I'm really moment.

However, big enough circulation allow even lethal ones thrive, ones could put dent vaccines since natural pressure emphasize transmission wouldnt strong. bar last weekend met bunch new people, every single person 30 already received 2nd dose.

In hindsight, really happy sticklers. Public trust hard gain easy lose. think US, given large fraction population distrustful government, erring side caution right strategy. Unfortunately, even sitting bedside, refuse vaccinate. Covid coming home! Data sourced link data taken individual countries. They're catching UK still leads FULLY  Hopefully there's enough protected people vaccinations prevent much threat here. Way go Canada! almost feels like china singlehandedly trying make world return normal. 500 million. Amazing **Summary:**

Argument government:

* People taking health protocols lightly.

Arguments experts:

* highly contagious Delta variant, exist last year. Delta strain believed entered Indonesia people arrived overseas, Indonesian migrant workers returned abroad Idul Fitri. 
* Short quarantine period people overseas (including India, Pakistan Philippines). New arrivals underwent quarantine five days, incubation period COVID-19 14 days. government said quarantine period new arrivals Indonesia would extended eight days starting Jul 6. 
* government reduced number contact tracers end March, infection rate started decline. tracing ratio 1:10, standard least 1:30. one person COVID-19 positive, 10 close contacts traced. Yep, I'm boat. There's little benefit us get vaccine data - us anyone else. I'd likely feel sick getting one vaccines COVID. love people downvoting telling story. Nope, almost open visitation. Administration recently let families Covid rooms, even unvaccinated. gown let bedside. It‚Äôs insane, compassionate. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs good answer. Part says let see loved one die. rational part screaming helping spread what‚Äôs killing them. end, it‚Äôs call. Honestly, J&amp;J vaccination rate low right think change much anything all. incorrect 

GBD? Jay, Ionnadis, ilk basically said ""do nothing"" anti-mask.

Hell, guys said India conquered COVID beginning year. follow leader that‚Äôs job parent.

Yep. 100% kid 18 months, cant wear mask yet. mimics us. Also live Florida cases high... Lol ok, I'll water even more. Y'all porcelain real. ""Science denying, jim crow enacting, national embarrassment states."" bargain compared economic costs  I'm glad conducted survey reach scientific conclusion. 

For me, asthma would've waited approval that's agreed process. process exists reason whether valid anymore talk changing that's case. there's difference EUA full approval skip whatever steps remain they're clearly redundant cut bureaucracy. Aerosol full virions accumulated asymptomatic person's room. released rooms door opened. HEPA air purifier operating rooms virion concentration would order magnitudes lower. someone help make sense appears contradictory statements CDC? statements question found here: VaST concluded relatively reports myocarditis date cases seem  predominantly adolescents young adults,

It goes say CDC safety monitoring systems, rates myocarditis reports window following COVID-19 vaccination differed expected baseline rates. However, VaST members felt information reports myocarditis communicated providers.

I genuinely appreciate last bit said felt information communicated, great. confusion saying reports myocarditis seem largely adolescents young adults, go say reports myocarditis seems line what's expected otherwise. reasonable assume children myocarditis often adults case? feel like I'm missing key conclusion two statements sound ridiculous read article real context particular point.

I guess short, children young adults reports myocarditis despite instances differing norm, myocarditis appear often not? Sorry obvious answered before, thank you! That's really amazing. We've managed keep Delta control. question Tedros still top dumpster fire org. wish lived there! also gorgeous countryside, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Bernie Sanders. Indiana corn, Mike Pence, 43% vaccination rate. Even breakthrough Delta infections glorified sniffles unfortunately pass away boned regardless there's much that. Covid stay vaccinated far I'm concerned good go live life pretty normally. 

The cats bag point people tasted normal life going back. sub weird mix ""we're going die"" ""this flu I'm never gonna wear mask"" hard gauge anything here. 10 days since symptoms first appeared, fever, symptoms least slowly improving, good get vaccinated. CDC guidance.  Raymond James Stadium 1/3rd capacity crowd 30-40% fully vaccinated health care workers sitting heavily enforced social distancing masking requirements. 

These college football games going 80,000+ stadium, plus parking lot tailgaters, masking social distancing whatsoever time spread variant transmissible.

Do math, genius. Dutch three kisses actually! Everyone know basically relieved last year though haha. It‚Äôs simply selfish ignorance fear. look majority people won‚Äôt get vaccinated. They‚Äôre fed selfish ignorance fear daily dose of, er‚Ä¶ummmmm News? call FOX. won‚Äôt give satisfaction calling news. It‚Äôs FOX. There. can‚Äôt accused sitting asses nothing pandemic.  leadership probably. Critics early paper right empirical evidence weak. engage‚Äîand 16 months later still engaged‚Äîwith moral arguments. continue argue best course action face empirical uncertainty nothing. 

This toxic, incorrect shortsighted. Dr. Michael Osterholm one critical ‚Äúmask‚Äù studies efficacy ‚Äúmasks‚Äù (quotes often times studies don‚Äôt differentiate poorly differentiate mask types) often called improved access N95 KN95 masks science support overwhelming efficacy. 

You see, studies show limited efficacy efficacy exaggerated media, skeptical public less willing accept mask mandates. Anecdotally, nearly far right leaning friends dispute efficacy KN95 KN95 mask laugh suggest neck gaiter going protect anyone. 


The proof there, stress importance masks, push mass distribution you‚Äôll get buy-in.    GTFO ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù nonsense. asked polls vaccination plans, Republicans across country far less likely Democrats say plan get shots. recently, Wednesday, Monmouth University Quinnipiac University polls indicated almost half Republicans plan pursue vaccinations. around one 20 Democrats said same. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è wouldn‚Äôt hysterical dipshit scenario. using strawman argument won‚Äôt get anywhere, I‚Äôm saying bashing random person flying bit excessive. We‚Äôre talking COVID, carbon footprints.

I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs important though, I‚Äôve multiple climate protests everything reduce footprint. that‚Äôs thing, it‚Äôs footprint. don‚Äôt go around shaming people something completely normal. 

The real question is, flying often normalized is? No, don‚Äôt think so. can‚Äôt change bashing strangers online. 100%. I‚Äôm stuck Australia right vaccine procurement shit show. We‚Äôre left basically vaccine doses here. govt put eggs domestically made AZ basket, problems put order 40m pfizer doses back queue. We‚Äôre still &lt;0% vaccinated, literally nothing even offered anyone 40.

I idea I‚Äôll able leave country see family again. haven‚Äôt home Canada 2.5 years, it‚Äôll probably another year we‚Äôre allowed country again.

Send help underestimate big lions are. Even without teeth/claws, absolutely fck really tried. True likely depends set rooms ventilation. wonder windows open vent rooms potentially virus building up. doors seal well spaces underneath? often people open doors? last time person walked hallway room? seems likely virus mixing air shared spaces rather someone catching within matter seconds. Air moves easily spaces droplets. means professional trained study things also worry messaging impacts behavior masses. last November people laughing wearing mask, everyone similar cough clearing throat shit.

Could cold, clue familiar though. Reason gotten tested health insurance. it, I'm trying around sick people. Since feel covid matter whether don't, much have.

I could wrong knows. 

Last Feburary started trouble breathing issues heart. I'm low body fat, low body fat, still sort am, iv eating more. Took long ass time recover go back gym. 180 start pandemic, went 160, I'm 190 upping much eat lifting again. 

Yknow wearing masks hurts nobody even vaccinated. wear mask, life changes adapt. Yup. Yup. going send American anti-vaccine people conniptions, even though government clear kind thing never implemented here. Whether like not, Americans right choose whether vaccinated treated equally regardless choice.

Quote directly White House: ""The government now, supporting system requires Americans carry credential."" Yes, helpful. really need step vaccination efforts. way stop damn virus.  three straight days whatever reason Thursday- Saturday , yea week . figured since everyone‚Äôs cases going people charge still get daily number decided publish reason past weekend. Yes, also mindful people simply can't vaccinated. stay masked sakes. Yup, lots US sites this. Loads things able access past years. post responding conflating England US south, suggesting similar, presumably derogatory way. 

If even cursory knowledge two places, would understand leagues apart pretty much everything (politics, religion, society, culture, attitudes vaccines).

The holier thou post thus displays certain level ignorance, ironic given intent it. point? also say laws  less germany thing. 
Most things exceptions low incidence tested, vaccinated cured.  Interesting, I'm CA used one drive-through pods set state.

Since entire process car, would remember handed something sign.

I also checked signup website, also find anything like that. I'm wondering since provided state implied, perhaps Rite Aid covering back get sued? Tests longer free well (unless prescribed doctor). chose avoid vaccines constantly getting tested start paying pocket.  media needs promote something people hysterical keep viewership up, flavor month. hope bus drivers got hazard pay respirators. Yeah, unfortunately last thing said matters. stat means many people is: ‚Äúsee it‚Äôs unsafe!‚Äù  Look anecdotes completely useless except certain media outlets narrative sell. studies.

JJ AZ traditional inactivated vaccines. vital vector vaccines. that, give natural immunity unvaccinated people, boost single dosed people likely get mild symptoms asymptomatic anyway, probably encourage people get vaccinated.

Sounds like lot dead people me. Yes! Oh, see. apologies.

But second statement stands. going hard sue anybody tinnitus. Hearing loss, sure. there's lasting disability, going get much settlement, anything. Ideally they're correct getting vaccines much important trying get correct one virus slightly worse caused ""healthcare dam"" burst much faster. 

If there's ever pandemic sends 70% afflicted hospital minor recovery hours oxygen people perfectly recover home, would still completely overwhelm healthcare system result many deaths even though disease could said ""less dangerous"" Covid Hell yeah. I'll join you. Thank God science. ""The rain Spain stays mainly plain"" Leading theory appears prior exposure coronaviruses ""close enough"" provide That's yearly incidence, comparable. likely looking something like ~4 weeks vaccination. Nope, I'm 33 got second dose June 13th pop-up, getting first dose 5 weeks earlier.  Mixing doses. Etc long dose cycle
 
Candana fast possible.

Perfect enmeg good getting . Ontario data Canada wide course consider fit England Ontario 8 times tend treat province seperately unvaccinated get vaccinated  Natural immunity means protected re-infection caught COVID before. completely new virus, immune system able fight first time straight away. Diet, exercise vitamins going change that. course, healthy means better chance getting mildly sick. going prevent infection. Yes, hopefully they'll become mandatory schools. actually got second dose today. Time lick door handles again. mean? Time break Barry Manilow way get high vacinate young children. Keep masks is, also means us vaccinated folks probably keep masks indoors crowds. chance erradicate takes people acting like complete dipshits exerting bit self control put behind us.

So need something that's never happened history human race? Good luck  believe government takes this, since emergency approval pay much regular one, $300K think probably never paid. bad. makes next sense, given South Korea believes room fans kill left long mandates timers them, dumbest policy. ‚Ä¶uh go get tested? confirmation whether COVID travel HVAC systems apartment apartment office office? tested positive, mean can't enter?!

Sure, people never leave farm, never go school, work anyone else. enough make huge difference. fair, dont see texans state accuratly report. do, im sure lot people arent getting tested. yes low numbers, accurate ones. Im Ontario, region currently 0 active. thats also probably inaccurate. interesting data mention R0 5-7. 
That fits pretty well exponential growth netherlands last week infected went 600 9000 12 days.

The case article seconds open doors √§r course exception unrestricted people infect average 5-7 week. No, infected person opening door breathing directly person filter stop that. They'd wearing masks people going that. civilization people would selected long ago! Pray Apocalypse!!! Lol  Well one blame predicament themselves.   I‚Äôll never forget meeting marine back 2005 age time (19) straight told joined could legally kill people. real hero‚Ä¶ goverment make vaccine* conduct studies, reviewed data. Pfizer even part operation warp speed. 

They still saying, implicitly least, ""I'll take chances COVID think COVID less risky.""

*The NIH, iirc, work Moderna some, NIH certainly *make* vaccine. think they're really ""perfectly intelligent"", people capable educated things. thousands conversations kinds people believe nonsense, tried apsolutely everything educate them. again, even know basics it, basics learn kids elementary schools, let alone high school curriculum. strict template learning, understanding whatsoever, even finished high school, doubt.

They're capable fields expertise, includes scavengers, manicures, pedicures, bakers, small shop vendors, carpenters, toolmakers, basic assistants, farmers (no offense normal people jobs), etc.

I shocked first ran people online, abnormally large number them. tried first see they'll understand least something, often ended even capable understand much 2+2, yes, stupid!

But then, eventually got used it. rugh time, needed full year actually come senses, realize we're dealing with, deeply incredibly stupid people actually are. Heck, calling ""stupid"" compliment. They're beyond levels stupidity. Again, facts get downvoted here. Makes sense. go, Reddit.

Look vaccination rates. Young people MUCH LESS likely vaccinated older people. Yeah, I‚Äôm sure liberal age group country bunch Trump card carrying antivaxxers. Give break!!! Reddit never disappoints, hilarious!!!  lock quickly usually much problem. said, lose nearly 1k people state last year, place country big break out. Avg age death late 80‚Äôs, older avg age death aussies general  shit lol.

It matter mandate like polio vaccine whatever things  That‚Äôs whole point mediCal. Use it.  first boosters probably going general public. Given decreased effectiveness shots older people, people immune conditions transplants, several different drugs, etc; given recent studies potentially big immune boost third Pfizer shot, I'd really like discuss this. I'd love list people/conditions/drugs considered booster, guidance start seeking them. 28 days. Thanks! I'm almost completely recovered (except quarantine) See comment. Medical covers ER visits. Seriously. Hospitals people whose job help figure stuff out.  used work medical patients. cover ER visits. case, looks like they‚Äôre going everything catch it. know, like wearing masks.  dig it. There‚Äôs bit sanity, north go. much need.  live Missouri, East KC, 4 kids 6 years old. still cautious sure tell you, sick shit! amount ignorant selfish people state absolutely astounding. wait, variants people continue suffer consequences. hopes people ‚Äúgood‚Äù diminished.  last year made people risk averse paranoid know they'll ever comfortable going back normal.  Big brain people.

 ""If exclude 700 people study, get 82%!!!!1!1!!""

Is dude said Mahomes average Qb remove good games? pandemic isnt ending years.

I mean western nations overall?world over? Worse thing tell people (Americans) people believe whatever see Facebook, extent weaponized us all. easy lose perspective *long* state is, considering ""big"" state US standards. Indiana. look news stories YouTube COVID vaccine downvoted hell back comments anti-vaxx. still believe COVID conspiracy put US government, democrats particular, vaccine poison pumped blood.

Not mention many comments affect friends family, know farce. tunnel vision people shocking lack empathy disgusting.  way could see happening every government became authoritarian forced population collectivism. uncomfortable topic one thing autuoriatism gets right controlling population times like compared democratic uncollectivist nations essentially leaves continued existence human race good individuals.

A bad cop, good cop style government would interesting. government behaves like free democratic nation times peace turn authoritarian government times disaster pandemic. source? you, one types, mind small raise tax dollars fund VA make sure Veterans place sleep night? ""lazy moochers"" put lives line country ""just get job?""

You pick one. Israel released give third dose immunocompromised patients. There's certainly science support this. 

I mentioned possible need booster science becomes available. think political. Pfizer pushing needed booster even consulting US health departments. FDA CDC make statement saying warranted time. arm felt sore day. good after.  Chicago different kind crazy.

The two extremes meet one side's mascot pardoned side's felon former governor TV show sides seem OK this. Seeing lack empathy compassion world come light trying time, really disheartening. mean need Philips Hue hub anymore? Yeah cases people getting shouldn‚Äôt super rare  would say washing hands eat part good hygiene. understand. time discussed manager staff meeting, treated delicately. Like think can... want fire people getting vaccinated. Even acting like can't demand proof vaccination. Walking eggshells whole issue. 

It working home. would make return work. strongly encouraged it. Australian government beginning year saying getting people vaccinated race see playing out. Yeah it‚Äôs happening needs information spreads kids. live VA, School years starting August already anti-mask protests School Board meetings state, including live, even though child died Covid-19 neighboring jurisdiction recently. Thai people actually like china, sinovac. someone living here, thinking. Without trust nothing, worth it. public hospital can't turn away Thailand using sinovac, different sinopharm. Absolutely  one said otherwise.  Education one thing, couple years schooling going override person's entire belief system worldview. know large portions population believed COVID hoax serious people trusted told so, told things agreed beliefs. accept COVID real serious could mean confronting possibility things may believe strongly also lies. Israel found breakthrough cases earliest vaccinated. preliminary data, it‚Äôs data. dangerous frame need booster motivated profits little data suggests may justified. don‚Äôt want get booster. want know framing issues vaccine politically monetarily motivated already done enough damage. There's couple big reasons case though.

* many people vaccinated now, anyone vaccinated gets infected likely mild case even symptoms all, unlikely die.
* children account LOT cases (IIRC UK like 1/2 cases children) know children typically mild symptoms, unlikely die.

In unvaccinated people, wonder deaths common now. Delta far contagious leaves people much larger viral load could cause intense infection unvaccinated. would love to, actually briefly looked post history see done something like this. feel creepy deep dive though, I'm happy linked. people see type thing. really hope well! I'm Canadian, quite opportunity Americans have, I'm fully vaxxed husband soon. want part healthcare workers, passed people like you, close. best. ‚ù§Ô∏è  shit, people today STILL wearing masks despite tons evidence showing still spread COVID even vaccinated Also keep mind seychelles policy give AZ age 60, already weakened demographic. demographic majority break cases deaths matter vaccines used. news sites use literally statistic gear things towards certain bias. Like said best listen actual health scientists words studies, news headlines.  UK vaccinated much population countries, plausible number world deaths rise significantly, though much before. pandemic 'ended' two weeks second shot; understand anybody at-risk would want prolong misery 6 month old he‚Äôs getting breastfed. offer protection? want vaccinated already  Absolutely. incredibly stupid go honor system early vaccines everybody fucking knew anti-vaxxers would ditching masks too. everybody wants pretend like it‚Äôs Delta rages.

I live Chicago work people know fact unvaccinated. hit ‚Äúphase 5‚Äù work requiring everyone show card take mask off. soon hit phase 5 let everybody take mask even though never apart going phase. I‚Äôm one last ones wearing mask treated like weirdo still wear I‚Äôm exposed unvaccinated people 10 hours day. stupid. might need discuss long term effects disease. might get sick live might lung issues, clots cause lot damage parts body. UK vaccinated much population countries, plausible number world deaths rise significantly, though much before. Go ER. Tell front insurance. vaccines. don‚Äôt want take shot Yeah, suppose you‚Äôre right. 

Even efficacy better nothing guess.  really random like that. Living household family member active infection raises likelihood catching symptomatic case well random chance within general population.

Probably one vaccinated person got infected, terribly rare, transmitted vaccinated person extended close contact with, also terribly rare. cases included multiple severe cases death, would rare. question is, still pulmonologist? interested reading it,. wrote much longer detailed description (including link Lung X-rays) entire thing here: burning up. dont know right now. Please someone tell post get help???   democratic leadership. keep focusing ‚Äúprominent democratic‚Äù ‚Äúdemocratic leadership‚Äù I‚Äôve said beginning liberal messaging conservative messaging.

Take sub example. sub rails reasons conservatives tout hesitation, completely ignores black people hesitant higher rates. care? care wonder why? care find out? care address concerns black people? No! see talk conservative hesitation one iota concern black hesitation. 

WHY? chlorine entered pool!
I repeat chlorine entered pool! 100% is, that's biggest problem. reason went AZ first place preorder anything else could manufacture Australian corporation party members invested in. entire situation story corruption incompetence every level government. I'm referring actual video someone presenting severe symptoms. mild case Covid date, still issues lung capacity. long covid dilemma severely underplayed here. surprised hospitals insist nurses vaccinated else job NY, red part. (Still waiting someone explain why, despite 30 minutes Canada, see Confederate flag often)
Folks seem forget entire state outside city. Imagine it‚Äôs similar.  end bullshit. son 6 months want vaccinated. think point it‚Äôs common thing, practically almost every one heard version 5G Covid Vax theory. Perfectly intelligent yet ignorant people believe that. 

This older folks less tech savy, less likely understand information technology less basic biology even less epidemiology. Despite mentally intellectually capable fields expertise. 

This problem worse developing countries older generations don‚Äôt tend educated many basic learnings get schools, believe theories. point they‚Äôre significant proportion society you‚Äôre treating insignificant minority. Lmao  I'm sorry want happy came through! That's experience people hear about. Honestly, nonchalant attitude many Americans mind boggling. smear? simply posted history, especially numerous run-ins law time habit blaming someone else, conspiracy get her. know single person immediate circle arrested four times, yet woman insists trust simply basis word, actual supporting evidence behind there's good reason wonder honest emotionally stable is.

It seems like we‚Äôre witnessing significant lifestyle clashes. We‚Äôll probably interdisciplinary Psychology/Anthropology/Politics courses dedicated ‚ÄúMERICA‚Äù phenomena (and I‚Äôd take heartbeat) Okay, here's palate cleanser:

When lived Dubai, local paper ran (as straight news) story woman Fujairah accused witchcraft mother-in-law. MIL claimed woman cast demon MIL. sharia court interviewed demon. Speaking MIL possessing, demon confirmed indeed daughter-in-law put demon MIL. strength evidence court convicted witch.

The conviction overturned appeal civil court.

It's crazy world there. Worth remembering witches hanged Massachusetts long ago.   yeah people dying people would take vaccine would play along crowd destroyed life year says 'take vaccine'?

This makes sense number levels. trying say here? blaming China vaccine? blaming China public health officials countries recommending lockdowns points? blaming someone else besides China? crowd talking about?

Look, bottom line virus got China country defend best pandemic. 

A pandemic affects whole world whole world react accordingly. would nice biden kamala didnt say wouldnt take vaccine made trumps presidency studies show, long continues breastfeeding get passive immunity. feel one, want son vaccinated asap.  Personally trying limit tech bedroom. Jeff gets much money data is. Wish could parents let lmao. tried convince luck though.   said negative? really think black people believe racism solely confined arrests incarceration? San Francisco, school board says even education system systemically racist. told thing ‚Äúmedical racism‚Äù. told there‚Äôs real estate racism regard redlining. Actually told every institution America racist America founded racism run white supremacists.

I live Asian enclave next black enclave. I‚Äôve talked black people neighborhood really feel everything country racist can‚Äôt trusted need live rules survive trust everyone tells best. [Supplemental see becoming modern day leper patriotic, okay. Seriously, want people die, color law, since can't legally shoot them, next best thing. others end timers, hoping praying apocalypse start. others eugenicists think kills weak. vulture capitalists, looking make money-as long get hands dirty go prison. much hygiene benefit holding cup water one hand simply pouring without soap? number one reason lost.

Good post. deserve gold. 

I think healthy young people worry much receiving vaccine. question may help mom/dad age vaccine might less effective health deteriorating.

Is something might help prevent get hospitals? really dearth information area. I've seen things course, often focused new promising high tech (and profitable) treatments little things could home. extra Zinc help? Aspirin? Asthma inhalers? Vit C, D, B, A, etc? 

Anything cut hospitalization risk would help, especially things well tolerated proven safety record.  slow vaccination actually causes doctors hypothesize aren‚Äôt setting rules natural selection may steer towards resilient variants. Yeah, part allowing employees work remotely permanently sounds wonderful. hall chairs 1.5m apart. best idea allow lot people vaccinated would need lot rooms. also great resource! given second dose cause ""symptoms"". symptoms necessarily BAD thing - uncomfortable life owe us total comfort. symptoms, apart rare events like allergies, caused vaccine ingredients directly (Apart maybe bruise spot), caused imune system reacting something sees threat. precisely want. case, think, achieve end goal 'as safe be', herd immunity brutal, right? essentially saying expose everyone it. die, meant live.

Whereas vaccine negates need seeing people take COVID punch. They'll later still (likely) take punch, vaccinated, they're least wearing protective clothing soften blow.

Also, though know many, people get COVID it. Especially different variant.

Sorry, slight tangent, find whole natural immunity/herd immunity idea interesting. Criticism understanding welcome, want learn! Israel continues register high number daily cases, Health Ministry opens third vaccine shot immunocompromised patients. completely agree. I'm scientist large hospital system. strongly believe need put focus treatment options people die reduce hospital visit time.

We particularly need treatment prevent worsening symptoms applied soon start appear, home. 

There really little information area often possibility even shut ""misinformation"" even hurt may help. shift goalposts. original comment ""It's within right choose vaccine use,"" true. Simply waiting randomly something assigned know choosing, gambling.

Exactly. example Brazil, US response basically ""we going offer vaccines, going recommend letting people die accepting vaccines Russia"".

Anyone complains Russia killing people spreading disinfo western vaccines, spreads disinfo Sinovac / Sinopharm exact thing.  Well every time idiot politicians try sensible thing populace literally starts rioting streets setting shit fire much masks though.

In terms treatments, best options today early stage monoclonal antibodies may even help people previously vaccinated already memory antibodies circulating. early Regeneron trial showed treatment effect strongest without preexisting antibody response probably excludes vaccine recipients cases. worried man. 103.7% adult population KL vaccinated first doses, yet cases KL slowed single bit. hope reduction people second doses hit higher percentage, currently 26.6%. must something wrong.

Or realize society expectations living society. think that's true. know France recommends vaccines everyone (with talks making mandatory cases), seems case UK well. Except never cases.

Hospitalizations deaths metrics note. leave. live major cities unvaccinated anyway. guess people NNN care people getting sick dying, that's downplay virus. ""I want forego marihuana.""

""I want give childbirth.""

""I want stop red.""

Freedom never, never absolute. think is, understood freedom. all. really ask ""why not?"" thread aftermath government said ""why not?"" Euro.. watch nba, mlb, American sporting event, serious insanity.  antibody test past infection necessarily one need show immunity vaccine (or least I've read two different kinds tests). might try look somewhere anyone's interested. doesn‚Äòt help though worse physical living condition low income. Also won‚Äòt help employer breaks law says ""\*\*\*\* you, paying you"". You‚Äòre low income, going afford 1-2 year long legal battle?

I sure whether ever Switzerland, differences living conditions poor rich small Switzerland compared countries Europe. Even compared US developing countries.

As law suits employers, actually rather quick due special nature handled special court. Besides, even lose job, unemployment social welfare exists props people well.

I would rather attribute difference Covid outcomes differences culture education. rich friends much likely see doctor even minor things ""poorer"" friend likely taking days going back work. thieves joy comments hilarious sad.  enforcement New Zealand either. allowed go 2 km house Ireland book go outside shop countries. It‚Äôs less, look see lied, ‚Äúyes, cases called covid deaths places, corrected cases tiny fraction overall case count.‚Äù

But deniers won‚Äôt see way.

Apply cases, still excess death 2020 well beyond known covid cases, that‚Äôs dip traffic accidents, dip suicides, dip gun violence. 1 &amp; 2. Yes, possible symptoms covid-19.

3. Unknown. exact odds long term symptoms well known neither duration. general, people recover completely acute infection people long covid report improvement time, slowly. yet. Eh Pat Quinn succeeded him, elected next election. Pay Quinn like Jimmy Carter Blago. Blago well hated sides aisle. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll super spreader event like every outdoor sporting event since fans allowed back places.

Which again?  even concerned.
Chill out. Exactly we're UK. July 19th, ""Freedom day"" 'independent thinkers' call it. Eugh, dread think we're gonna back square one months.

Best wishes lovely Dutch people Yeah. I‚Äôm referring level duration. exceptions like NYC parts California large majority US dealt restrictions actual lockdowns. basically enforcement mobility anything nature   sure fucking hope so. I've dealing covid shit since January 2020 want able go without worrying again. wearing mask, it. cares. want go covid rampage even know vaccine truly going protect us forms covid.

I want normal life continue again. Unfortunately people obsessed wearing masks make reality. least countries like Korea able things, actually wear masks there, (surprise, surprise!) keeps numbers down. little devil mutating order survive better. Whichever mutation works one wins.  ""Personal responsibility"" less selfish seeming way saying ""not problem"" talking social issues. Dutch rioters like Mexican cartels intensity wise tbh, would rather gravely injured die dispersed Switzerland those. even special court handle cases employees employers, free charge employees. employers paying sick days extremely rare, system makes hard. Basically way pay letting employees go (which illegal people vacation sick leave), runs 2 months minimum notice (often 3 months). unemployment takes over. 

Oh, like sane country, health insurance bound employer, nobody loses health insurance laid off.  Haven‚Äôt looked study England suggested Delta variant 1.5-2x lethal. reply exactly people get news social media. full anecdotes lies. it‚Äôs always real, don‚Äôt send military failing hospitals year end hundreds thousands excess deaths nothing. respect people's individual rights. one person forced anything 

But wanna wear seat belts!!! waaaaaa T***p would recommend get vaccinated‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm holding Delta Pro Max. think people lack information, inundated false misleading information. *Proceeds apologize grammatical correct sentences.* doesn‚Äôt get talked much anymore, seems Wuhan strain isn‚Äôt even hit east coast.

Look much better Seattle, LA, SF NYC, NJ, MA, even New Orleans initial us wave.

It seems west coast got infected Wuhan strain people flying home China, east coast got hit mutation occurred Italy first US wave. level education exactly high that's surprising. Chinese vaccines effective AZ JJ without VIPIT capillary leak safety problems. country even use AstraZeneca anymore due safety issues younger people. mRNA vaccines definitely effective, young people starting avoid due myocarditis. imagine Chinese vaccines caused problems? would blasted media public unsafe Chinese too. teacher. fully vaccinated still!!! wouldn‚Äôt let us open window ventilation Heroes need extra pay, since heroes /s  saw tv, shook head. 

Yep, COVID pandemic series trainwrecks occurring glacial pace. People learn Partially, think it‚Äôs lack critical thinking. It‚Äôs lack trust experts lack trust institutions. various reasons, many Americans refuse trust scientists working asses make possible vaccines fast. average American simply cannot understand basics viruses vaccination basically demanding trust. too. good friend smart bizarrely fallen vaccine conspiracy ideas appeal something concerned about, even though ideas make sense scared vaccine. quarantining hard core always masks home. Except decision affects others well.

I'm individual freedom, greater good society supersedes opinion. Especially kind decision based misinformation.

People tend forget people can't take vaccine medical reasons, way protect people reach herd immunity. course. That's important know effective AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson without safety signal issues. Kind ludicrous point ignored told black people would first line get vaccine reparations. ones die, course

And got voted speaking truth? Poor guy  5g causes covid Bill gate wants inject chip arm steal personal information. Wait, what? 5g loads Facebook faster? know that. However also important mention effective AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson 67% effectiveness. without safety signal issues. Young people country even taking vaccines due VIPIT capillary leak even mrna vaccines due myocarditis least UK got finals (and lost). worth it. /s  both?

Interesting. original alpha still common Germany still solid appearance Italy. everywhere else small part infections (of countries shown). delta primary strain USA, UK India. 

If change table people fully vaccinated, USA lead UK right behind. scary considering people USA vaccinated.

Edited add: tried add Israel table believe Israel vaccinated everyone early wouldn‚Äôt let me. table shows countries. works well AstraZeneca JJ. Less mRNA vaccines. reason see much hesitancy specifically Sinovac due massive media campaign it. cases begin surging UK one questioned AstraZeneca. Delta variant. cases surged Chile, sinovac work. one seem care deaths surge Chile unlike neighbors, yet saw highlighted time time UK. Ironically, Sinovac inactivated vaccines ones without safety signal issues plague newer like day one

That's part disagree with. done day 1 vaccines would much, much uglier. 

Now vaccines adults get simple get vaccinated stop worried. no, first *detected identified* India. I'm sure they'll find witch responsible pretty soon.  respect people's individual rights. one person forced anything Meanwhile US anti-vax idiots breeding new variants (most likely) mean less 90%, also mean partially, case likely age there, much less that. Waiting comments vaccine work since needs booster. Oh wait... That's reserved Chinese vaccines. This. Plus already much better success covid many diseases. know someone works sepsis andcovid. sepsis clinical trials decades without real success almost sounds annoyed behalf sepsis research discusses they've discovered three treatments covid validated clinical trials year.  half family jakarra hope stay safe. lions enclosure lion without teeth claws. we‚Äôre worried incase lion friend around corner. shouldn‚Äôt go unless check every corner, checked oh again. frogurt cursed necessarily inaccurate? time get third shot trials, we‚Äôll middle Fall likely new variant creeping overtake Delta. Six months seems baseline time everyone seems think vaccine effective. Beyond that, opinions vary. six months seems shots distributed based abundance caution. Yup, unfortunately delta nasty variant hit Japan hard, seems vaccines still taking way long receive, especially Tokyo. vaccine system abhorrent. must wait govt. send letter schedule appointment- imagine slowing process.

I'm shocked breathtakingly bad Japan this, knowing Olympics coming Tokyo. Now, Japanese citizens absolutely scared. friends students Tokyo, even worse :( people psychologically invested summer ""the back normal summer"" want tolerate another month two restrictions

It's understandable infuriating. Yes, get tired shit. No, understand can't put big boy pants wait _just fucking longer_. 86% adults vaccinated

2. policy saving lives (versus CDC guidelines). show peer reviewed scientific papers.

3. CDC's decision political scientifically based. That's 2 one. Show us proof CDC's ""motivation"" show us evidence - large amount CDC provided - shows decision scientifically correct.

You one people science

right says/implies wrong. laboratory real-world vaccine data (for vaccines approved use US anyhow) says wrong. Vaccines work mRNA vaccines especially work well.

People like point dangerously close anti-vaxxers undercutting effectiveness utility vaccines. saying close saying. bad talking points directly fuel theirs. barely see reason differentiate anymore. Okay üëç   statements ring true‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ free dumb‚Ä¶..it makes anxious Wow $100 whole dollars‚Ä¶  Bc people get covid live. Like people car accidents survive yet still use turn signals, stop red lights drive reasonable speeds conditions. 

It‚Äôs almost like since people also less accidents everyone whatever wanted car. Yet reason people still wear seatbelts without much thought. 

Strange. think that's overwhelming majority vulnerable populations vaccinated, higher percentages younger people not. danger dying vaxxed.  That's probably true lot places too. unclear, handbook procedures address it. purposefully followed.ü§Ø ....that's vaccines always for.  family went cabin getaway rural Michigan weekend. first time traveling since pandemic. decided wear mask town grocery store don‚Äôt know area well rural areas bad reputation regarding covid beliefs. Two guys proceeded mock check-out using air quotes saying aren‚Äôt supposedly vaccinated snickered me. first run-in like speechless. whatever reason couldn‚Äôt mind business make fun wearing mask.

This article says nothing protection others, protection ? 
This really confusing, vaccination stop contamination spreading. doing? Isn‚Äôt problem don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs going benefit early intervention, time get trouble already point chasing immune system trying slow down? Government institutions systemic racism. That‚Äôs fact. Again, medical community created vaccine wouldn‚Äôt make sense blame government vaccine hesitancy.  hospital system never really got worked people didn‚Äôt experience weeks total lock minimal Yeah, vaccination means tolerate much higher amount cases. think figure Ireland previously every 100 cases would've resulted hospitalisation, every 300.

C-19 part Coronavirus family. type virus studied 50 years C‚Äî19 virus emerged already data structure, genome, life cycle type virus. took full year develop- mumps took 4. key due spread misinformation! cuban healthcare system hell everyone tourist. Btw, streets right claiming democracy repressed. never said that. said advocacy groups like Black Lives Matter telling black people government systemically racist black people care continuing survival trusted. lot people supported b l narrative. I'm gonna explain statements false. expect listen.. people reading future might. new technology

This false. mRNA conceptualized research begun far back 1950's (source: Various uses mRNA 1961 present found listed here: ). new technology. "" know long term effects of""

This fundamental misunderstanding vaccine works. TEMPORARY mRNA sequence gets inside cells instructs cells produce ""dead"" spike proteins. That's it. changing anything inside body. Thinking could ""long term effects"" like thinking receiving Email somehow ""permanently changes Email Application"". doesn't. can't. That's designed. mRNA used (or whatever parts unused inside cell).. broken passed waste body. can't ""do something else"" randomly body. code contains code manufacture spike-proteins. That's it. like Emailing friend recipe Chocolate Chip Cookies worrying somehow gonna ""cause Wi-Fi get slower"" (or completely unrelated thing). nonsense. ""for virus 99.98% survival rate healthy people.""

The problem statement is:... Even acknowledge mortality percentage low,.. thing CANNOT accurately predict persons individual outcome. Someone well could young (NOT high risk group).. SARS-Cov2 could still end killing them. currently way accurately predict that. literally like playing Russian roulette life. .01 means 1000 people room,.. random 10 die. Except way accurately predict 10. That's problem. could (or someone family). way knowing ahead time. Masks don‚Äôt guarantee won‚Äôt catch transmit Covid. **BUT**‚Ä¶ inarguably lower transmission rates people play along, turn allows hospitals free staff focus huge backlog non-Covid procedures built last 18 months. 

Masks also benefit really hampering economy. politicians (ahem, Ducey) issue order **prohibiting** mask mandates isn‚Äôt conservatism: it‚Äôs hubris-driven nihilism. Honestly idea. people around sick. bf developed symptoms hours apart think got exposed time. live crowded college town work, go parties clubs often. I‚Äôve visit bf city we‚Äôve hung friends gone shows. careful covid since vaccinated :( shows provides interesting correlation classes, education, trust institutions political ideologies.

Thats freedom comes in. minute government requires vax, better China. reason many vax passports. concerning people understand. fact people questioned anything GOOD thing. nice change pace normal sentiment praised before.  telling government representatives saying government representatives racist trust them? would interesting strategy. good news incorrect also medical community made vaccines government. You‚Äôre hypothesis wrong. Youre ""asking questions"" simultaneously say ""It impact!"" 

You, one asserting long term impact, evidence. Therefore, assertions bs. actually showed hate us care us. agree. Honesty would best move there.    like OxySackler epidemic believe would case variants not.

The vast majority cases occur vaccinated people going mild. That‚Äôs pretty much expected. Docs quit telling patients don‚Äôt want hear 10-20 years ago. It‚Äôs past time doctors start truthful patients again. personal physician last chance get folks lifesaving vaccine.

Patients need told vaccines save lives, quit smoking, lose weight, exercise, eat veggies, man needs little blue pills it‚Äôs time see cardiologist. mainly based numbers article, combines multiple studies multiple countries: still around 95% mark fully vaccinated people. looked detail tweet. seem like statistics normalised underlying risks age. extremely careful taking raw data face value hobby epidemiologists. assessing endpoints Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, Day 209, Day 394, Day 759.

They finished 5 6. point reason expect won‚Äôt full FDA approval, especially given outcomes carefully monitored studies proven successful.  studies started idea would work. Relative SPED preschool teacher finished person summer school.  kids issues, reminded whole class told ‚Äòto cover nose‚Äô. one kid hated mask wore chin except went nose minutes. teachers non-wearers class.  one got Covid wicked cold went thru class, mask/under nose wearers ones got sick. 10 days 20. That's mildly alarming. symptoms have? ""Please pay us back cocaine"" thank you, US risk, put circulation.

However, risk, still circulation, effects COVID affects people survive it, even mild symptoms, unimaginably worse vaccine.

Feel free grow day now, we'll keep paying way you. we're sociopaths. Wrong. idea you‚Äôre talking about. *engage ritual cleansing nothing hygiene quick look, 7 day average deaths 300% past 30 days? Granted relatively low 9/day 27/day time

So correlation higher deaths higher cases still there, bad deaths younger people getting guess?

But cases still leads deaths based data trend   Living America effect Ah, spring 2020. Good times. meant Covid care general. see way insurance companies continue pay monster hospital bills refused protect chose ignore advice medical experts. Well lower education economic status sure correlated covid stance. That‚Äôs perfect example it‚Äôs Bayesian. It‚Äôs wishful thinking state affairs statement. Probably accelerating socioeconomic trend rather changing it, like everything resulted. accelerating established trend decade don‚Äôt hear mainstream Democrat telling minorities get vaccination.

No tell minorities government institutions racist don‚Äôt care black lives mattering. would black people trust government now? people still lack empathy? dumb fucks won‚Äôt get shot literally don‚Äôt care experts say. them, they‚Äôre ‚Äúexperts‚Äù one tell different.  Bummer vaccine could administered like farmers use crop dusters fields. spray done. rare. seems implausible people struggle conceive acting good whole. OP here's 2 cents:

Yes shit wild. Go back time year type headline trying hard prevent - ‚Äúhospitals running ventilators‚Äù. yet are, vaccines available going bad lack interest, hospitals trouble keeping people alive. 1. Rhinovirus alpha-coronavirus responsible common cold; seasonal flu(what?)

You 2. majority alterations happening variants s-spike region specifically epitopes Receptor Binding Domain(RBD). specific area targeted antibodies neutralization. Changes region good maintaining neutralizing immunity‚Ä¶.

But isn‚Äôt case many changes spike protein may rendering useless binding, infections? it‚Äôs well established **coronaviruses** don‚Äôt impart long lasting neutralizing immunity. That‚Äôs get sick **rhinovirus** (aka cold) every years.

Two different viruses. said, Rhino viruses far lower rate replication fidelity far higher rate mutation 3. Yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going need source SARS 20 years immunity it‚Äôs well established coronaviruses don‚Äôt impart long lasting neutralizing West Virginia you.

""Okay, opinion"" - anti vaxxers Ahhh, that's comes from! There's fee right name. take fee put po becomes POTUS! actually thought title said virgins first briefly totally confused connection covid, virginity, vaccination. bulbs may bright, wits remain dim ever.   plan, similar one used docked cruise ship, going pretty 3 adults got (plus unvaccinated kids) Pfizer It'll forever people get vaccinated. where? 

Arkansas doesn‚Äôt seem plan beyond praying miracle &amp; Hutchinson going city city begging people take shots. Social distancing never thing here. legislature doesn‚Äôt want lockdowns mask mandates. Unless something changed last 7 days, masking. 

The Missouri governor said doesn‚Äôt need federal assistance vaccinations. None door door crazy talk. Mercy Springfield hasn‚Äôt overrun patients, ran vents due mismanagement.

We many cases around still new, everyone assumes they're safe. - second shot Pfizer (mRNA) simply different first shot?

Always same. different formulas nothing different. moderna AZ.

It lot vaccines well, might get multiple shots vaccine, case immune system (who always busy) decided ""drop"" template antibodies needed ago. Though vaccines like flu, might change yearly, really rare. wonder people feel Polio vaccine, MMT, etc. damn thing... Yeah give call shoulder. Wait, shit Novel mean context?? I'm using vaccine remotely interface phone reply post FL slightly US average (US 48.3% total population fully vaccinated, Florida 47% fully vaccinated) Let‚Äôs forget South Africa also destroy millions J&amp;J contaminated batch. original J&amp;J delays. I'm perfectly calm. go somewhere else can't handle pretty normal critique flu vs CV comparison? thing happened cousin second shot. Fever,chills, body aches, throat irritation diarrhea. Felt great afterwards. think got infected first second shots. suspect second bout covid19. vast majority cases treat like flu. Isolate, bed rest, remember eat stay hydrated. take something reduce fever coughing unless way awful things healthy healing (coughing especially, reduces fluid buildup lungs). Get medical attention worsen. Small comment numbers low end. probably expected low miscarriages happen first trimester. So, many women got pregnant time 2nd trimester end first trimester already miscarriage receiving vaccine therefore counted 'miscarriage' numbers. really suck I'm sorry way. I've got 6 year olds easy us, too, people area also gave worries pandemic. need get outside nature much possible. Meet people ipad much possible. Meet person vaccinated university already said masks required vaccines staff.

Wait, ""no masks"" mean masks optional, allowed? allowed, would highly recommend supplying good masks, make somewhat others wearing masks. like Korean KF-94 masks similar standard N95 (e.g. BOTN brand). make sure seal, pulling bit tighter mask ""ear saver"" helps. seal means air going around mask. guess would masks supposed temporary measure. enforce long people say ""stop"".

Allowing vaccinated people wear mask might incentive people get vaccinated, idk.

But think reason mostly policy around masks+vaccine hasn‚Äôt super reevaluated since Delta variant, there‚Äôs lot pressure life ""go back normal"".  Yeah selection pressure towards reduced virulence transmissibility virus spreads symptoms kick in. I've saying this, along many others months months I'm consistently downvoted oblivion censored mods sub people understand basic evolution natural selection would rather put head sand pretend pandemic over.

It's like talking 2 year old, god damn.

Keep well. It‚Äôs bizarre. Everyone age group know scrambling get one soon available. lot us wanted see loved ones safely again. relief worrying spreading people. can‚Äôt imagine wanting feel way it‚Äôs free super easy, unless you‚Äôre incredibly susceptible certain celebrities telling to, guess. correct might get schooled real hard court can't say there's risk can‚Äôt help think topping antibodies might also particularly relevant _at stage_ pandemic, access vaccines still incredibly uneven internationally travel negotiations taking place various countries. 

If parts world already waning antibodies intact memory cell immunity, suddenly means travellers highly-vaccinated countries might pose potential risk less-vaccinated countries, rather way around. situation, trying control spread boosters they‚Äôre available seems extremely sensible, even though might less important whole world memory cells. First told it‚Äôd make sterile, told it‚Äôd make magnetic, told I‚Äôd able turn lights couch.

Since 95%+ effective, statistically wouldn‚Äôt likely many would get otherwise I‚Äôd say. hit 1100 cases 3 days row, double last week 5x month ago. I'm worried. :| Stay well! lol blatantly ignore first part post there. Read get back me. Define safe. Zero risk? No. Extremely minimal risk? Yes. Even less risk severe disease hospitalization death? Yes.

In short, go it! That's correct Honestly, think we'd found gold nuggets endless morass pandemic forced us wade through, talked proper sick pay people support people stay home actually ill, rather engaging trench warfare masks! fully vaccinated since early March. Felt safe stop wearing mask. Got sick last week tested positive Covid. I'm sorry I'm perfectly happy wear masks every time go distance people I'm young healthy chances getting sick covid extremely low feel like forced getting it. Same. esoteric freaks Iive vaccine... ""Don't want anything unnatural body"" ""If get I'll fight mind"" ""Think positive"" month doses lot supply though. recommended manufacturer minimum interval maximise effectiveness.


From heard, 99% take second dose (Sweden), pretty surprised figures They‚Äôll talk amazing getting developed quickly useless dangerous vaccine breath. blood plasma patients who‚Äôve recovered COVID? direct quote Wait... needle go **into** nose????  conservatives narratives affect white people, disregard black people affected BLM promoted racial distrust black people make less population?

How fight versions promote anti-vaccination narratives? Black people die covid 3-4x rate white people deserve vaccine protection too, even make smaller segment population.  case delta unfortunately.

source? Pfizer board member believe anyone thinking like ""blindly"" believing something. problem. Within couple days, mRNA shredded RNases. Within couple weeks, constructed spike proteins deconstructed proteosomes. fat particles used encase mRNA strand allow pass cell membrane (which fat does) eventually broken liver otherwise metabolized fuel. typical vaccine, side effects seen almost exclusively first weeks administration. rare clotting issues transient pericardial inflammation pop shortly shot. month past second shot golden. lot folks closely interacting public known suspected covid cases entire pandemic.

They still it‚Äôs way pandemic fewest deaths, get many think way do.  Next, please insert remote ceiling fan?  One child young vaccine. expert, please take say grain salt.

If understand things properly, attitude goes something like this, breakthrough nothing cold, eyes Public Health big issue, colds overwhelm hospitals, thus concern talking breakthroughs.

If breakthrough results hospitalization concern could overwhelm hospitals, thus tracked.

The vaccine stop getting virus? 

I thought minimised symptoms get it?

How getting vaccine help anyone else? I‚Äôd imagine skip second dose already Covid. really don‚Äôt need second. Also, anyone got hit hard first dose likely Covid before.

Basically excess mortality reliable thing have. ""At time"" makes almost useless headline. could change tomorrow Hospitals empty. Infections among young. 
From public health point view, widespread infection summer non at-risk population want. keep getting way it? Getting vaccine reduces likelihood catching virus, still catch it. catch it, reduces likelihood severe, reduces likelihood passing someone else. 

So yes, catch spread virus, much much lesser rate. 95% infections month June MD unvaxed. makes 150 break threw infections MD time.

Thats solid data seen people need stop treating one dose like full protection.

I'd say biggest steps come certain healthcare systems overwhelmed. happen enough people immune. bars shut midnight nightclubs close doors number coronavirus infections Netherlands soared sevenfold week. ... risk holidays factor decision bring back restrictions, said, adding hoped EU countries would look hospital admissions rather infection rates deciding Dutch face quarantine extra tests.

Really nice double standards there, plea EU countries look hospitalizations shut ""surge cases""? Get here.  hyperbole. know getting info, virus ""doing damage lungs, brain heart"" vaccinated people completely made up.

It's always confused countries like Italy, US, Portugal etc. peopler wearing masks outdoors ridiculous things still getting completely fucked ass covid, nobody ever dealt much better. like people convinced things zero evidence work, effective.

What matters healthcare system, limiting indoor contact + masks indoors, testing. That's 99% battle.

Anyway, really see border controls would difference UK. places far lower case count do, even completely open borders, number imported cases can't miniscule fraction domestic transmission.

Masks effective even outdoors, usefulness much limited - large outdoor gatherings slipstream (downwind) vicinity one many individuals. Aerosol levels compound issues, north european countries generally cleaner outdoor air. 
 matters healthcare system, limiting indoor contact + masks indoors, testing. That's 99% battle. 
 
You missed enforced restrictions border crossings. Use R value hospitalization. vary jurisdictions hard set. I'm starting believe way pandemic second American civil war. ‚ÄúExpected amount deaths‚Äù Infecting people they've recently vaccinated pretty strong argument opening sooner anything. time population antibody protection infections mild compared wanes, whilst infection boosts immune system response future. Alongside that, give natural immunity unvaccinated people, boost single dosed people likely get mild symptoms asymptomatic anyway, probably encourage people get vaccinated. get population closer herd immunity levels protect waves variants.

The advisors largely uneasy good option choose from. basically open whilst activities still outdoor oriented vulnerable people greater guarantee immunity vaccinations, younger people fully vaccinated yet, wait reverse true. options significant negatives.  That's interesting hear. Thank reply. much awareness stupidity  It‚Äôs still 90%. ya even law large numbers sucks heh.  Pay attention bald guy never agreement everyone risk assessment. Many people conditioned fear COVID degree never feared anything life. difficult walk something like back year two living absolute fear. true PTSD take long long time overcome some. I'm vaccinated. still wear KN95 mask public spaces bother much. Even so, I'm still level afraid. Especially public transpiration, etc.

This say going yo-yo longer personal risk assessments going place. Eventually we'll move on, going process. key people sides risk spectrum respect other. Instead often see either side believes dumb mother fornicators intelligent enough ""proper"" risk assessment. IMHO long vaccinated follow CDC guidance automatically get said respect tolerance. I'm Eindhoven, got hit pretty hard first wave may helped. dare people enjoy England‚Äôs first final 55 years It‚Äôs around 10% chance (fully vaccinated Pfizer 90% effective delta )

But isn‚Äôt like 10% chance time encounter like crap shoot.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* either.  weird thought UK issue. Thanks, answered something similar, yeah, understanding basic evolution seems lacking here... Ayyyyyy Live long prosper. people get covid higher chance new variants. course aggressive ones prevail push weaker ones out. What?! Pretty sure US guinea pig. state opened back March. happened UK it‚Äôs infuriating, always late make decisions early repeal them. backbone. mean... can't. say sure, absolutely mutate point longer penetrate human cells, likely done that, many times last year half, mutations get passed along because... well know. Virus populations evolve time, individual viruses do. mandatory inside last Friday experience 90% people wear masks. I'm hoping people start staying home they're sick. feel like Christopher Guest missed opportunity make mockumentary centered around school board. 

Also, fuck people. people get drunk iota power. surprising folks refuse vaccinate  UK yet 12+ vaccinations right? numbers school age groups pretty devastating uk areas like Liverpool. stick in? Seems like there's lot assholes choose from. could wear helmets drive, I'd rather let seatbelt, airbags engineered crumple zones they're designed do.  No. Mutations mean different, that's all. Mutations outcompete variants mean better spreading, that's all. 

Yes, (sometimes) downward pressure mortality rate tradeoff infectivity, that's mostly type that's mostly dead people spread disease, severely sick people stay home.

That said, COVID-19 seems significant asymptomatic spread phase, kills people slowly. means necessarily downward pressure mortality rate disease. even know many people died Spanish Flu? needs personnel dedicated ENFORCING COVID guidelines laid events, force necessary. 

It come force. 

In Asia say ""oh ok guess want seem like greedy asshole put personal wants ahead public needs"". There's minority greedy got shame-based culture, one wants speak even personally think they've wronged.

In west there's guilt-based culture, there's nothing stopping people something long feel personally justified. There's sense shame anti-lockdown protestors see it. we're Amsterdamned. infections major cause concern.

The problem want reduce spread, actually important since many unvaccinated people around. vaccinated people getting spreading it, many areas lot death full hospitals. Vaccination hugely reduces risk spreading virus. 
 
Yes, possibly enough bring R 1,0, least seasonally.  Yeah playing guninea pigs rest world literally medical experts scream horror, breeding ground new variants seems like northern england already got new one neck!  may die, many crippled, thats risk willing take. know you‚Äôre asking Alabama nurse, NJ pulmonary nurse yet see fully vaccinated patient COVID. know exist, I‚Äôm large hosp far, nothing. Also factor breakthrough infections amongst vaccinated still result lower transmission unvaccinated. Studies I've seen show 50% reduction. missing out? dont see whats happening never going get pandemic...  Blame every govt Mulroney onward wanting spend money it. Yes, delta dominant strain Ontario weeks now. recognize can‚Äôt this. certainly would upset vaccinated individual could get access proper care emergency situation hospital capacity population making willfully ignorant choice. talking lockdowns again, [a significant people U.K. want permanent lockdown (probably less countries still higher number think/is acceptable) large parts Europe likely headed towards another round lockdowns next weeks. soon start fall i.e. respiratory virus season one dare relax restrictions back hammer go (at best) next spring. Rinse repeat. mistake panicked Delta (personally I'm not, all), governments bound unless something drastically changes.

Where I'm there's absolutely zero plans get back normal, health officials already talking potentially years even consider dropping masks example, there's end even remotely sight. Lots people comes actually like kind idea. everyone thinks know live life properly definitely perfect health never make bad decisions themselves. think pay anything inferior people obviously lived life wrong got sick, since they're certain know they're they'll always fine. Thanks reply. long close contacts isolate? look team could significant number needed players quite accurate. Virus mutations generally become less lethal original aligns natural fitness survive. virus kills host, prevents able infect new hosts. common variant virus typically one spreads easiest. Transmission easier virus incapacitate host.  ""You want people together buy groceries choose take vaccine"" wear mask*

If willing follow precautions ""God protect me"" ""my body choice"" (except abortion someone else, reason that's choice too)

Also, already government mandated vaccines US. far dictatorship public health mandates. Also, 60% nearly enough herd immunity. many things wrong everything saying. they‚Äôll believe Trump crazy people questions asked   clear, marx monopoly criticism economic systems. number thinking people throughout history significantly greater one. additionally, ideas retain use past death author - still find screwdriver indispensable, even though inventor dead 600 years.  least BC, optional 2nd shot could get. I'm unfamiliar provinces given choice not. think far mRNA vaccines AZ vaccines available, priority getting 2 shots everyone, delay got AZ 1st shot. many jobs, mostly avoiding blame. shift responsibility someone else, makes job easier. think deaths make huge point. delta hit Canada yet, interest? Hopefully like Israel places, government shitting reinstating almost immediately. Yeah mean really going fundamentally alter way human beings interact order control single virus? insane me, given dangers world exceed covid. vaccines work awesomely well. vulnerable protected vaccines. masks ok always band-aid. Long term viable; live place insists long-term moving. People forced live cloud pandemic heads forever. *Delta Variant wants send message* Yeah bizzare. many people seem *want* way life go ever. saddenning. Hospitalization follows infection one week early conclude problem.  strikes one actually compelling reasons want vaccinated. is, prior health conditions (which going assume immune related something like, dunno, bad kidney), still caring enough mask protect others much possible.  Tell everyone around Florida. Shit, gonna go Arkansas month visit, may rethink that. naw fox news says 99.63333. clearly anti conservative agenda Bye Felicia. Ph boi seen indian media, fully tamppered per need Current Govt. try say anything suddenly become anti-national. would nice start pissing face say ""what im me""  got fully vaccinated second moderna shot weeks ago, trouble whatsoever. spend time 92 yo grandmother also vaccinated issues, right thing good citizen. 

Making sacrifice (not really much one) getting vaccine much different Americans done times crisis past. WW 1 WW2 food, fuel, metal, paper, many items severely rationed war effort, people changed jobs work factories aide war effort. mention thousands thousands died fighting wars.

They proud so, since Americans knew really mattered life. 

Learn idea, really patriot American first Democrat Republican. 

One final idea...Isn't percentage unvaccinated population US similar percentage population narcissisticand borderline personality disorders?  right that, result months ineptitude. plenty middle easterners itching kill white non muslims too. rather kill battlefield elsewere. Sad say, know looks. I‚Äôm back curbside pickup deliveries‚Äîsafer inside 6-7 10 unvaccinated unmasked. use track little buggers. Scroll near bottom percentages active strains.  projection: everyone unvaccinated gets covid summer-fall-winter plus vaccinated people get too. Glad started giving Moderna booster shots health workers got sinovac pregnant women refusing shot (at least temporarily) *because* care others. many sick people going make point go that‚Ä¶ probably many reply email surveys coward ex president came told ppl real patriots wear masks get vaccinated different things would be. funny part trump vaccinated fuckers still refuse even though dear leader is. would vaccinated people still need wear masks public?  thinking test scores follow **approximately normal distribution**, meaning people score near middle distribution scores scores drop fairly rapidly frequency one moves either direction also normal distributions, mean median equal. So... u/Hannibal_Spectre technically wrong, stated ""It‚Äôs true 50% median, necessarily true 50% normal distribution interesting properties: bell shape, **mean median equal**, 68% data falls within 1 standard research vaccines SARS MERS able get COVID-19 vaccines quickly. would impossible run trials SARS/MERS vaccines viruses spreading, thankfully. They're saying median 50% average going exact. statistics joke. still threat hospitals b eing overwhelemd? already happened swine flu Hong Kong flu?

&amp;#x200B;

Or implying need vaccinated well? US ""others"" still account 4% cases. respect even strongly disagree people dont get vaccine feel might rushed therefore unsafe. ppl refusing get dont think covid kill selfish assholes. herd immunity makes vaccines effective. imagine someone 1940s like poli vaccine fuck dont care neighbors kid gets paralyzed. Nothing really Ireland. announcements open age group, much way trying encourage people. really needed since uptake 90%. correct. increase jumped massive degree 45 degree angle since June 22nd. That's 2 weeks 5 days. increasing lot slowly. That's enough time get results happened. haven‚Äôt heard anything viral load increasing. I‚Äôve heard symptoms changing incubation period less (a good thing) Vincent Racaniello Week Virology podcast harps time‚Ä¶ difference infection disease. Antibodies wane time might get infected T-cell response remains (which far looks like vaccines) fight without getting sick. (From understand)

I recommend checking podcast, particularly one Alessandro Sette guest. Sorry, that's lie, quote public health professionals, Dr. Fauci, doctors tell us take it, I'll first line take it, absolutely. Donald Trump tells us take it, I'm taking case measles? New Zealand Australia part endured long lockdowns though, exception Melbourne one. border restrictions made difference them. European countries experienced much tougher longer restrictions. Uhg  Actually, not, exceopt limited circumstances. 1-2 years standard prediction nothing done. Scott Morrison offered little plan Australians roasted Reddit.  alternative honest, want taxes vaccinated taxes paying hospital bills people chose get vaccine.

This logic applies AIDS hospitalizations. dental hygienist told didn‚Äôt want vaccine could make sterile. wanted wear mask avoid COVID get vaccinated. wasn‚Äôt thrilled working teeth even though I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. clearly help much misinformation came public health authorities.

&amp;#x200B;

I remembered hearing advertisement radio saying vaccinated people still need wear masks practice social distancing. lot people heard was, ""Vaccines work"". took credit multiple times could anyone forget that, google ‚Äútrump taking credit vaccine‚Äù. obviously wanted part legacy. news, water wet. one. They're misrepresenting obvious reality, Trump highly likely try rush approval without safety validation Biden saying would trust Trump specifically without scientists OK. 

Basically...trump tendency lie benefit. Biden risk life Trump's honor. agreed, evil. safe mix drug months apart?  consequences extend beyond one‚Äôs nose. one take steps endanger others health, happening people forgo getting vaccinated, become accountable society large. freedom absolute saying it‚Äôs little better China belies black white thinking simply isn‚Äôt reality live in. societies gradations rights obligations. Drivers licenses oft referred example. 
Once pandemic reached, well within rights people country require residents take actions protect whole. core civilization. things take granted stem kind cooperative mentality requirement would rest on. far mandate, bending backwards offer incentives. interpreted kind Machiavellian scheme pretty ridiculous. isn‚Äôt yet communities shun life line suffer. Shit, like US going using time soon. find surprising. know barely anyone would aware different types vaccine, even among eager, Pfizer far best reputation here. going worst wave yet across Southern US low vax areas.

I'm sure. huge wave really materializing. figure many already got infected, top get vaccine. I‚Äôve looking UK % vaccinated age band data can‚Äôt find anywhere? point right direction please thank . alarmed UK vaccinated 16% 18 24 group far open open completely . I‚Äôm Canada around 60% 12 17s vaccinated 18 24 high 90% areas . This. Everyone know anti-vax Democrats (which say lot people assume they‚Äôre mostly republicans) peace, love essential oils. üôÑ Yeah, alone help win. Although would handle pandemic well, example reporter asked would say American families, instead berating reporter would say ""there tough times, together, promise come victorious"" something like that. form team expert follow advice.

Hard times bad, generally things unite people (look 9/11 helped Bush win 2nd term), expert managed divide people something like this. words, human nature. link data? released? still can't find it. happened swine flu? 

&amp;#x200B;

Remember *that* pandemic? That's said. said take trump approved without scientific approval. 

Oh and, around time Biden saying head FDA said mask important thing could stop disease winter. Trump held meeting say wrong misunderstood question since necessary wear masks. also, fda suggested need stronger safety protocols vaccines said would reject them. Also, continued promise would approve one election day, seemed like obvious bullshit effort get reelected.

Link Orrrr doesn‚Äôt work like ‚Äúmiracle vaccine‚Äù pedaling There's also guarantee antivirals work indefinitely, influenza nasty ability render antivirals ineffective gained resistance. Covid might easier deal knows long would take virus eventually decelop resistance antivirals. curious, drug came tbe 1990's influenza, Rimantadine, approved FDA worked effectively guess decade so. evolution largely made prescribing medication useless longer widely used. even enough veteran right kind veteran days, aka strait, cis, possible white. Ah that‚Äôs good point. Make 19 then. love god stop wasting resources antivaxx nuts. 

Let live natural life desire.  Less replaces competed. reports mixed infections far Delta Delta+ variants spread easier cause disease easier. Restrictions caused governments, pandemics. Best luck educating people Arkansas something self interest. call surge  Yeah, strict wishing harm/death others it'll result ban. I'm giving benefit doubt here, please refrain types comments future. Thanks! place I‚Äôm torn morally poor healthcare workers ones paying price keeps mortality rate much higher. something completely preventable point. I‚Äôm also thinking strained long term healthcare prospects survive lasting vascular damage. whaty people Where's data? Covid age, scientific data studies available practically soon they're completed. making systemic public health decisions data unwilling release, problem. seems like that's exactly they're especially they're offering third dose 'high risk' especially Pfizer relying data finally make booster case they've months.

This feels sketch money driven public health driven. Good catch, linked wrong thing citation manager. I'll edit post. UK data Delta took hold. Israel's data show's greater reduction efficacy, even though 64% seems likely Men HIV raped babies? kind world this. think part issue may rural areas health resources developed areas have. rural resident gets ill, get sent big hospital densely-populated area. rural residents hear ""big hospital overwhelmed"" - apply *them*, that's city-folk, everything's fine country, *we* take precautions?  fair enough great hear still protected vaccine Hopefully vaccines pushed effective Vietnam. They've gone pretty incredible lengths try keep Covid stop potential clusters. Unfortunately point due diligence start crack weary population. I'm doctor anything, Spanish Flu Russian Flu three year ordeals. probably roughly timeframes. Viruses apex predator arrives/becomes new threat perpetuity - human body eventually figures ways fight them, rare cases human body compromised (IE: HIV), medical science eventually picks slack. There's reason whatsoever believe be. Still yet see actual data. seems real sketch. Luckily Orlando majority people still mask/socially distance grocery stores anywhere else you‚Äôd need run errands at.

It seems like everywhere else, especially South Florida, complete opposite though. Yes it‚Äôs real loss didn‚Äôt bother develop generalized coronavirus vaccine treatments even SARS MERS.

If afraid COVID-19, stay home vaccinated. point removing mask mandate encourage people get vaccinated. Data shows worked (to extent).

They damned damned don't.   live area discussed. I'm vaccinated. vaccines had. many people want Trumpers conspiracy theories. idiots, still things cannot safely do. can't visit friends hospital. I'm everything right, still masking, taking many precautions possible, everyone else ruining me. agree.

A cruise ship 100% crew passengers vaccinated would perfectly safe Covid-19. course would breakthrough infection people slipped cracks. Lol preaching shit week ago got downvoted hell Americans saying 'i want wear mask taking away freedoms'. shit end say does, viruses mutate, read book. Put fucking mask on, get vaccinated, things might approach normal soonish. willing action.  Haha can't even say ""bit—Åh"" seems like need balls ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Oh news.

we fought them, confederacy killed lot Minnesotans beat them.  flying flag enemy.
 

traitors country back then, still day. (jan 6)



really see many confederate flags around anymore, since last years kind called are.  you, then.
 

my parents took corona seriously forced to.
 

I said would visit vaccinated.  said died corona one unvaccinated gave other, would longer speak whichever one survived relationship would over. would never get anger them. 
 
They protested bit, realized stone cold serious budge even bit, decided worth fighting. 

If want parents live, let know serious it. curiosity, many stopped driving cars, stopped taking flights, reduced consumption animal products? We're midst climate crisis, lazy walk ride bike supermarket. Animal agriculture one main contributors carbon emissions, animals raised factory farms endure incredible suffering, can't stop eating hamburgers.

I assume still shop Amazon despite knowing exploitative manner treats warehouse workers. lot probably seen videos Amazon dumping returned goods unsold electronics landfills. independent bookstores retailers forced close can't compete due unwillingness spend extra couple bucks support local business? willfully ignore simply care way company externalizes high cost low prices onto communities uses loopholes avoid paying fair share tax, want want want absolute lowest price.

What overweight unhealthy eaters? realize much strain put already overburdened health care system laziness poor food choices? money spend treat diabetes heart disease could better spent social services truly need constantly making selfish unhealthy choices.

Selfish. thinking yourselves. think anyone much likes felon former governor. Except side's mascot. Yep. likely broken infection/fatality link, meaning deaths massive proportion vs last year six months first second dose? 78 days, sir. You‚Äôre 100% right, course, second part. Totally anecdotal large enough population it‚Äôs something absolutely going happen someone‚Äôs family. (With 67% efficacy, probably lots families) feels weird actually family. Wouldn‚Äôt people start noticing light bulbs turning on?

Can get hm-2 instead metal zone vaccine? basically double think courtesy fox news, Facebook, etc. think past talking points given regurgitate.  ask questions know answer  still considered novel? toxic responsibility argument ‚Äúit‚Äôs responsibility protect you‚Äù really dropped pretense pandemic.

Is ""high quality information""? agree this. We‚Äôve got know we‚Äôre getting into, whether vaccine braving virus. folks act like COVID harmless others act like it‚Äôs impossible side effects shot, makes crazy. Let‚Äôs real make decisions. people getting pressured either way it‚Äôs causing divide. family adamant since already covid die (almost) fine. Saying vaccine still approved mrna going kill everyone 5 10 years shit. Covid almost killed dad, even lung issues now, still refuse vaccinate. think get get actually fully approved whatever, even knows they'll come with. Grow little bitc&amp;$‚Äùh point, nearly everyone hospital dying corona chose there, correct?
 
that's pretty insane, matter slice it. r/ihavesex  can‚Äôt take politics conversation pandemic.  Seriously given come light regarding Fauci anything says relied upon? stupid people be? Every single anarchist know got vaccinated, understand mutual aid solidarity. None us trust government. Coronavirus Pandemic death toll reaches 4 mn worldwide, according John's Hopkins University. US recorded deaths 600,000, followed Brazil &amp; India. Death toll &amp; infections rise; new infections largely attributed Delta variant. Vaccines indeed miraculous bicycles. Anyone who's pedaling going get far. high efficacy actually misleading. relative risk reduction percentage high, absolute risk reduction abysmal.

Pfizer Moderna 0.7% 1.1% absolute risk reductions Oaky missread post. thought discussion regarding US situation. Australia cannot ask vaccine proof? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, you‚Äôve come Kool Moe Dee‚Äù. Man I‚Äôd love see guy take responsibility. job build trust people get vaccine.  Disclaimer jump me: vaccines wonderful anyone get vaccinated selfish moron. 

That said, using stats go back January misleading. Very, people fully vaccinated January. 5-6 weeks first dose fully vaccinated, would mean people would get vaccinated first publicly-available (non-trial) vaccinations started. 

So including time period virtually 100% people vaccinated. think bad now, wait SEC stadiums start filling up. South going light like Christmas tree.  saying need lotteries? Man wish could think true. Ever think giving people much credit? real. People convinced COVID rite passage kids refuse accept alternative. president doctor?  ‚ÄúHey thing really dangerous, hang try fix this‚Äù

‚ÄúHey everyone fixed this‚Äù  I'm Oregon City, suburb Portland, Or, prides progressive.  There's guy two blocks live confederate flag window. 1000 miles away nearest Confederate state. 

Racists everywhere. Breaking News 7/11/21: Experts say diseases may actually transmitted person person miniscule creatures beginning call ""micro-organisms"", result angering Sun God previously thought Dumb question I've wondering about. know I'm unlikely hospitalized die since I'm vaccinated. long covid?

My wife locked hard duration finally able things like eat uncrowded restaurant on. helps area north 80 percent fully vaccinated, give confidence, too. 

But wondering still avoiding, say, baseball games, situations likely close contact larger number people? good risk long covid breakthrough infections taking precautions still that? well, people blame still get hurt. saw post Reddit Zombie move future didn‚Äôt people running toward Zombies yelling ‚ÄúHoax‚Äù ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt believable anymore. sad say rings true. People morons believe shit like that. What? That‚Äôs true all. lot critical conversations people later wound getting vaccinated. Many people life wildly skeptical Trump wouldn‚Äôt try rush something dangerous ineffective get people back work rich friends would make money.

Evenhanded discussion important, don‚Äôt much tolerance disinformation.  Healthcare something Castro invested heavily in.  Spanish Flu pandemic sputtered 1919 became another circulating flu virus. halt economic growth 20s.

Plus, modern tech, COVID never truly gone, it'll suppressed enough disrupt daily life. Pretty much. Right goal make easiest incremental improvements possible local autonomy. fair possible, extent slow vaccination rate.  Ok....

I'm blaming anyone. What's point? What's done done. problem, job fix it. Blaming others waste everyone's time energy.  seriously, sociopaths trying gain point? Trump office, vaccine widely available, states opening back up. benefit them? Wouldn‚Äôt lead people right dying higher numbers making harder politicians get elected? That‚Äôs always say. It‚Äôs pretty simple, don‚Äôt want son get covid. doesn‚Äôt mean think would die did. 

When got vaccine months ago, didn‚Äôt know feel. one hand nice hand, since son born July 2020 I‚Äôve really cared protecting him. I‚Äôve said entire time I‚Äôd take covid 10 times letting get it. It‚Äôs nice extra relief! Ok things different America. video though seems like loophole employers use Australia 'masks everyone time except eating, 1 covid test per week. Oh btw vaccinated prove exempt'  Man-made antibodies essentially work antiviral. that's problem Tamiflu - supposedly really good given early enough. try protected deez What's vaccination rate there? boot taste? so, somewhat similar death rate overall pandemic, perhaps? killed 600,000 Americans 4 million worldwide? Australia suits going, see soon. Exactly! advice many GPs tainted issues maintaining patient-doctor relationship, business needs, morbid fear sued. far easier comply patient's wishes tell want hear. hear stories GPs laughed patients.. *""Haha.. really expect take 'blood clot vaccine...

Good news today AZ rolled hubs select pharmacies NSW. People fill form, tick contraindications get jabbed. ""original"" Wuhan strain gone since last summer pretty much. always mutation another that's dominant ever since. Depending country stuff, SUPER bad knowingly selling involved providing drugs used off-label purposes. Ivermectin approved use, restrictions study requirements must followed.

That part reason drugs banned prescribed year ago. must studies, predefined end goals establish use willy nilly label something.

That's Pfizer fined like 1.3 billion dollars anti-inflammatory drug 2005(?).   We‚Äôve vaccinating 12 17s Canada since May , 60% age band climbing fast . far zero serious adverse reactions think need Ross Perot rise dead get TV every night slides showing vaccines work.  point choice zero risk vs. nothing mitigate risk. People like person replied misframing two choices. 

Rather, car accident example shows mitigate risk rather declaring mitigation ""mah freedumbs!"" moderately concerned take flight recently. real worry airport crowds. sad, anyone people determined destroy themselves? mild case. serious, Daddy would flown private jet negligible checks. get choice topping! Netherlands much farther behind vaccinations though no? UK got 6-month head start Europe.

And cases under-30s less vulnerability virus. closest thing ""common knowledge"" us COVID media came literally told us forget everything knew viruses. Glad hear old knowledge shared again. first ‚Äì worrisome ‚Äì scenario gain rapid control pandemic thus face future ongoing severe disease manifestations combined high levels infected individu-als which, turn, might foster evolution virus. Vaccina-tions prior infection might achieve long term herd immunity, need broad application vaccines worldwide combined comprehensive disease surveillance accurate readily avail-able diagnostic assays second likely scenario transition epidemic seasonal disease like influenza. Effective therapies prevent progres-sion COVID-19 disease (e.g., monoclonal antibodies reduce hospi-talization death 70-85%) may bring burden SARS-CoV-2 infection levels equivalent even lower influenza. However, remember annual mortality burden influenza, non-pandemic years, estimated 250,000 500,000, 650,000 all-cause deaths globally, comprising ~2% annual respiratory deaths (two thirds among people 65 years older)77. extremely significant health burden equates relatively ‚Äòoptimistic‚Äô view future SARS-CoV-2 third scenario transition endemic disease similar human coronavirus infection much lower disease impact influenza SARS-CoV-2. is, however, limited data global burden disease common human coronaviruses78 noted earlier sections, possible predict confidence whether adaptations SARS-CoV-2 humans increase decrease intrinsic virulence. I‚Äôve thinking this. tell anti vax propaganda actually made deep state democrats kill republican voters? Would get vaccinate? Idk.  r/covidiots  Could there's higher percentage breakthrough cases fragile individuals vaccinated early? case, seems AZ issues Delta.

Do link something similar back claim up? UK people far AZ job stopping majority get infected dying. Yes, let's dig heads sand pretend Covid-19 over. Mostly. Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri Nevada.  I‚Äôm glad Arkansas discriminating unvaccinated - Unfortunately, COVID-19 does. eggs crazy looking...

Story 11. Ok, response article UK sporting event. I'll take chances Oh got stories days. school letting parents say enforce mask policy not. board decided mask policy. 

On top later year admin got campus vax sites. 1/3 employees got vaxxed. It‚Äôs going hell year.  Superbowl/Memorial/Independence day  *Shocked Pikachu face*

The Irish public health team got lot criticism saying unvaccinated people travel there's big push towards holidaying year, think stories like coming made sense. Excellent analysis PUSSYSTAPLER. last time 7 day moving avg cases per day reached 31,000 Dec 22nd. Deaths back we're almost 500/day. Fully vaccinated tested positive. It‚Äôs still there, folks! cant afford vaccines taking granted. ya know what....at point? hook fucking machine tons needles stick arm times lmao xD going July 12 (Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte conceded Monday coronavirus restrictions lifted soon Netherlands apologised infections surged highest levels year. Rutte last Friday reimposed curbs bars, restaurants nightclubs effort stop spate infections among young adults, two weeks lockdown measures country lifted cases falling. apology marked sharp turn stance Friday, repeatedly defended earlier easing restrictions ""logical step"" refused take blame possible mismanagement government. KL neighbouring Selangor state merely administratively separated. intents purposes, considered regions. Many live Selangor would vaccines KL, thus unusual number. lay thoughts little this? saying it‚Äôs bad educate people they‚Äôll decide get vaccinated? wasn‚Äôt clear reading comment.  cold/flu season going hit HARDCORREEEE year. everyone saw much less ""sick"" everyone last year since masks distancing rules. since lifted? we're gonna fucked vaccine available infants - mean 2-3 months - see heartless psychopaths. Thanks!

They point detection period shorter load might similar able detect soon previous versions.


‚ÄúThe researchers found viral loads Delta infections around 1000 times higher earlier strain infections day viruses first detected.

They also found people infected Delta strain also likely become infectious sooner, Delta variant taking four days reach detectable levels compared six days original strain.‚Äù Links? definitely going interesting observing happens. Personally, I'm grateful UK taking next step. pissed cereal morning? sure read jab wasn‚Äôt .    country needs enema. sugma dick He'll claim successfully walked 'middle path' done 'prudent thing'. Problem middle path 'We removing restrictions soon' 'Corona fake used control freedoms' viruswappies hand, well walking middle path wrong. rain offer umberella, decline, chose get wet. Nobody forced you. can't ban going outdoors rain someone believe umberellas. 

People chose get vaccine wear masks, face shields, keep distance avoid people. reason force others suffer. 

There basically two choices: take vaccine get covid-19 (or alternatively leave society). soon everyone offered vaccine restrictions lifted risk kept safe (people cant vaccinate). needs personnel dedicated ENFORCING COVID guidelines laid events, force necessary.

Anyone ever done event security tell nothing stop determined mob. point break unless call anti disturb forces, use water cannons, batons tear gas, causing chaos punish everyone. Maybe even causing full blown riot. 

At point, official would (should!) wonder wise public event start with. facebook needs die! boomers driving go crazy ass conspiracy theories. boomerbook World meters showed 35000 cases Friday. Google friend. mean fuck I'm waiting year return norm. Fuck people can't wait cause they've wasted far collective human years part pandemic. Beautiful states Massachusetts Vermont reached criteria. mean Fauci lying American public majority career‚Ä¶. Idk read emails pretty damning validity honesty American public. Covid January wouldn‚Äôt miss work symptoms had‚Ä¶. need vaccine anything minimal symptoms?? HFMD bout 5yrs ago lost fingernails toenails. shit painful. I‚Äôd taken vaccine known facebook needs die! boomers driving go crazy ass conspiracy theories. boomerbook World meters showed 35000 cases Friday. Google friend. course undamaged. want reminded war actually lead mental trauma physical injury. Exactly Basically Tories gambling lives British public vaccines continuing (mostly) stop serious illness death.

It's gamble, though. tons data showing vaccines things.

There argument made wait longer, people opportunity get doses. quite comment. freedoms here? curious Due differences denominator would assume Missouri may one smaller numbers dumb people. Nothing exponential long. actually exponential would got sick mid 2020. People hesitant intellectual reasons lmao. yet vote counts! would absolutely surprised...... Gotta. They‚Äôre old haven‚Äôt seen kids year. well natural immunity variants surging winter (Europe) protect Delta? What's sugma?  included New Orleans.

Meanwhile Seattle marked first cases, literally canary coal mine, SF plenty seeding poorly managed Wuhan evacuation flights Travis AFB hour away. There's indication booster could help immunocompromised individuals, case third booster could approved them, require lot them, million.

Pfizer vaccinating rest world meantime. conspiracy theorist, I'd say trying get variant completely avoids vaccines, world buy new vaccines Pfizer. reality want short term profit. Good time job hunt. Lots companies offering permanent WFH policies. Good luck! get vaccine, completely free, insurance needed (they may ask insurance card get even without one!). Walgreens, CVS, many providers... Vaccination preventing spread though. US it‚Äôs like 97% new cases unvaccinated people. Highly vaccinated populations seeing big issues. past 600 years? thing ‚Äúnow‚Äù. It‚Äôs like this.  relevant? seems problem getting enough vaccines pushing higher vaccination rates versus vaccines used. South Africa 1.5m doses AZ order, time based clinical data available showing 10% effecacy Beta taken country second wave. Whilst disagree decision, changed vaccine drive dramatically, larger delay caused J&amp;J doses delivered month late contamination US plant.  actually makes sense, population density risk factor. scheme worked US, though, since urban/rural division sharp political divide, would exacerbated divisiveness. smart phones see data deaths. 

If new strain polio emerged tomorrow requires booster shit third population would refuse get ‚Äúpersonal

This seems relevant bit sure. vaccinated vulnerable first. would course account breakthroughs, without anything whatsoever fading protections. We're pretty much point now. 99.5% COVID deaths unvaccinated comment getting downvoted sums sub perfectly. True, could foreseen keep long enough control everywhere else. australian travelled new zealand delta variant visited every tourist spot infectious. new zealand community covid prior this, vaccinated still community covid.

his vaccination meant entire city, country, avoided lockdown.  Covid: suspected majority people really shit. Covid: know majority people really shit. That's bad news. good news history shown minority good people change world better - stopping pandemic tracks vaccine sadly menu ways happen everywhere.  studies, due shitty way legal system works even opening possibility accused insinuating could beneficial could bring lawsuits.

What said exactly why. ENTIRETY medical approval use revolves around whether current studies show show whether therapeutic use. right now, completed studies show benefits. Studies currently way point certain specific instances potentially benefitting ivermectin that's it.

If came said ""we're currently conducting study shows promise treating even curing covid"" opens accusations marketing ivermectin treatment covid. entire point types things prevent drug companies making killing currently available drugs situations like this. Making move profit people would panic buy would prime lawsuit fine territory.

Absolute risk reduction Pfizer Moderna vaccines 0.7% 1.1% respectively. abysmally low risk reduction top that, based information CDC past months, 78% hospitalizations covid obese larger patients, 79% deaths 65+. 0-49 group represents 4.7% deaths 28,263 deaths 596,740.

Now back question, 

I definitely vaccines, fully vaccinated plan vaccinate children, whole different ordeal. vaccine literally even available entire year. literally enough time information potential long term effects gathered organized. venous sinus clots J&amp;J endocarditis Pfizer Moderna perfect examples mean.

I worked covid ICU full year. Never symptoms, never positive test, even participated serology study every serology test negative. I'm overweight comorbidities. I'm old. dont fall high risk group.

When factor whole evolving situation, like said starting look like influenza situation going seasonal boosters even still catch, transmit, become sick covid.

I'm personally seeing benefits vaccine abysmally low absolute risk reduction rates also long term risk information available. Speaking hub incubators, love Vegas getting pass..we're pointing finger Branson 2 million people visited us last month, 38% vaccination rate, covid restrictions whatsoever, one friend went 65K maskless indoor concert last night. Another friend went 18K maskless indoor UFC fight. hospitalizations February levels.

""As highly transmissible Delta variant taken hold across United States, Nevada, and, particular, Clark County, quickly emerged epicenter latest surge virus. Friday, Nevada fourth highest case rate nation per capita last seven days; many days last week, first.

The uptick Clark County, ways, comes surprise. county low vaccination rate, high population density economy built bringing millions domestic international tourists together..""

The good news is, FEMA lands next week help us out.

Don't get wrong, Branson problem town full morons too, Vegas greater threat nation &amp; world.  Water wet. isn‚Äôt news. Well properly cautious people vaccine skeptical Arkansas, people still can't get vaccinated yet (namely kids). Leaving would big financial commitment can't make, also that's ceding two senate seats butt hurt wackos. question cases(pretty inevitable cases increase low vaccinated areas). worry vaccinated people falling sick-at least accounts reddit seems theres alarming increase this. hope every single death COVID unvaccinated. 1. gets rid one unvaccinated country. 2. Hopefully seeing loved one pass away, convinces least 1 2 get vaccine I'm European buddy. interesting thing delta first nearly nothing seems happen ‚Äî start seeing little increase infections ‚Äî sharp spike comes almost nowhere. see look infection graphs example Netherlands, Indonesia, Russia India. expect see kind sudden explosions many countries coming weeks. ~20% chance catch symptomatic 

That's pretty good odds, hang around bunch unvaccinated people spreading eventually run luck get exposed enough times. California seeing first uptick months. Newsom lifted mask mandates ""for vaccinated."" basically means one wants wear masks anymore.  feared. Vaccines prevents serious hospitalization deaths spread. Even 100% vaccination spread stop we'll continue lockdowns next years least. cases means deaths, probably less earlier still avoidable deaths nonetheless Im seeing many people bad side effects even ""dying"" im scared get still wearing mask, overall safe. living life back normal? Good see recovered, 5/10, imagine it'd like without vaccine. Stay safe. I'm sorry seems like outnumbered community, thank staying cautious. I'm San Diego vaccination rate pretty good restrictions almost gone now, continue mask indoors. Even though I'm vaccinated unlikely spread anything (or catch matter), I'd rather set good example vaccinated feel like they're ones masking. know rare, one may help keep numbers down. Yeah, talked grandfather it, incensed younger members family getting vaccinated.

He knows generally scientific, like, ""you're obviously getting though right?"" like, ""Oh yeah, soon can"".

Thankfully family gotten vaccinated, holdouts (even offered buy dinner got vaccinated!)  always statement number one *only reason* lost.

I'm saying important, ""downplaying"" pandemic, reason lost.  Oh god, missed one roundup quacks crazies, I‚Äôm angry (/angrier). 

The callousness types pumps harmful lies, what? Fame, money, engagement? don‚Äôt get it. Straight back Phoenician! tough times, together, promise come victorious"" something like that. form team expert follow advice.


Yeah never said thing like that.  that's speech would expect president.

Have seen holiday messages? always start something like ""Have Merry Christmas even haters losers...."".   Pretty sure NZ govt rollout plan vax year slipped least one occasion point timeline worthless. Earlier year said May 60+ late July? Maybe late July start booking appointment?

Will everyone country vaccinated year's end, everyone country opportunity make appointment year's end? rate, maybe it'll end everyone eligible hear they'll eventually able make appointment year's end.

Probably time John Key Aunty Helen got horn Pfizer CEO see help. Seems worked Aussie. Appreciate perspective, didn‚Äôt connect dots immunosuppressed people vaccine effectiveness  I‚Äôm never going understand.  April 30th US had:
10,262 breakthrough infections reported 110.6 million full vaccinations. accounted 0.009% population. 

Long covid considered around 10-30% likely patients.

Thhhhaaat‚Äôs around 0.0009%-0.003% could theoretically contract long covid. makes rare. 

Now even doesn‚Äôt account variants, Delta included, need consider much effect variant would ‚Äúescape immunity‚Äù. vaccines, data proving (so far) stats hasn‚Äôt changed significantly. Even data still collected, it‚Äôs looking Delta isn‚Äôt really changing game greatly vaccinated.

Going forward, I‚Äôve telling peers also emotional time. could tell go theme parks baseball games vaccinated go maskless fear real. anxiety there. Even high vaccinated areas like yours. recommendation definitely go things, earned supposed do. go pace, don‚Äôt let others put added pressure you. Bring mask wish to. enjoy yourself. Thank you! extremely pro-vac, too, keep seeing driving nuts. like saying 100% people died Wuhan unvaccinated. know people vaccinated January many even months people vaccinated quiet recently. want see conclusive: ""100 people church Sunday. Turns positive person spread. 80% people vaccinated, 90% hospitalized people unvaccinated."" That's info need getting yet. doubt available.  see!!

Well, either way comforting hear stories like yours. mom 71 definitely super anxious falling sick got 2nd Pfizer shot months ago. 
Wishing best mom! It‚Äôs pretty obvious earth trying rid biggest parasite humans.  vaccine approved tomorrow (not emergency use) would take it? Europe yes, exactly predict happen. painful era still continues, hasn‚Äôt stopped. Colombian think need stop trying cover sun thumb. ongoing issue need face instead hiding acting happened past.  Ozarks get tourists you‚Äôd expect.

Clark County definitely problem. Flint seems gotten mindshare far. much bigger, pervasive two schools kids attend made good ventilation priority enforce social distancing. experience three year olds actually much better wearing keeping masks typical American adult. addition that, studies strongly suggest kids actually pretty bad spreading covid. In-school mask mandates around long this. don‚Äôt even understand would controversial. Dude I'm tossing mask bad all! know sucks ventilator dying. folks actually care people's lives Cuba also first eliminate transmission HIV mother dislike people lazy read board posting on. doubted knowledgeable person. Maybe reading topic instead demanding spoon fed. I'm provide basic information you. expect thanked. Woo pig!! (I want die help) Posted someone asked basically exactly asking, here's honest answer:

I'm far politics reasonably willing least entertain idea experts institutions could help navigate crisis like COVID-19. moment doubts confirmed realized certain Americans strapped rough time.

It almost seemed like personal attack anyone worried scared. know yet can't even deal softball question like that? even criticized? understand different world rural areas, see what's going since March 2020 feel sense urgency? get people fed propaganda not, I'm talking people. I'm talking people OP references, think get vaccine point? can't relate line thinking.  source? Sadly however endangers either a) Immunocompromised can‚Äôt get vaccine b) Children 12 c) unable get vaccine location, time, language, barriers, etc. everyone isn‚Äôt vaccinated endanger others. simply unable There's even economic argument masks like lockdowns. stubborn dumbfuckery.  really use google more. people tell me: ‚ÄòI‚Äôve it, big deal, I‚Äôm going get vaccinated,‚Äô‚Äù said Craig McCoy, former paramedic who‚Äôs president Mercy Springfield Communities, operates hospital Springfield. ‚ÄúWhat don‚Äôt realize people antibodies alpha variant sitting hospital delta [Then Isreal already offering boosters   International travel likely isn‚Äôt coming back large way year fact we‚Äôre halfway year concerns Delta likely already significant setback.

Jesus. dump toxic, pessimistic horse shit. things - work hating teacher, unhinged middle schooler, political no-masker non-parent parent? thanks allot friend :)  I'd say yeah, COVID kill harm folks

You It'll eventually cause mutation kill harm everyone.

EVERYONE. SOME. yeah that's correct.

And yeah covid kill some. flu also kills some, cancer kills some, heart disease kills some, traffic accidents kill some. people die go lives. Sex cure. four five times daily, energy go anymore Symptoms Delta variant cold/flu like. reports symptoms different associated original coronavirus strain, Dr Yildirim says. ‚ÄúIt seems like cough loss smell less common. headache, sore throat, runny nose, fever present based recent surveys U.K., 90% cases due Delta strain,‚Äù says.

Wear mask. Don‚Äôt depend entirely vaccine. especially true you‚Äôre area like Missouri Arkansas many remain Arizona Ducey same. Big yikes. Dude, touch touched yourself?! Look caused highest death rates US past year. I'd say yeah, COVID kill harm folks smear? 
wow.

 woman insists trust simply basis word, actual supporting evidence behind it

We believe person Florida hiding risks coronavirus since beginning pandemic like climate change building codes.

It hard present evidence asked illegal murderous things simply refuse.

The murderers deny wrongdoing sick police you.

These lying murderers dealing with.  year half people still compare flu, like CV anything like all. family who‚Äôre left behind still refuse get vaccinated even though loved one died covid. something cannot comprehend. teachers ‚Äúone other‚Äù? mean doubled teaching staff, doubled teacher work hours? It'll eventually cause mutation kill harm everyone.

I think covid going kill harm everyone whatever Dude, one mentioned Florida

Just one place, fact ""over"". mean living life normally covid. probably wanted make Biden's 4th July vaccination rate goal fail. wanted comment say thank friend, went rabbit hole random brown widow information interesting read. /s thanks cool tidbit! biden says take vaccine, doctors say shouldnt, reasonable listen doctors get vaccine? fast test results nasal spray covid going 6 months , nothing coming market yet. ready vaccines year :| might wrong, didnt Fauci cause hella deaths aids pandemic? hesitancy vaccine?  sent Mercy Rogers, Arkansas. patients transported St. Louis &amp; Kansas City. Dude, one mentioned Florida get bent shape it. even read article? cases going rise unvaxxed folks. It'll eventually cause mutation kill harm everyone. prevalence unvaxxed folks increasing (in US) amount infections potential mutations increase day  Absolutely. problem car go car mechanic city mayor.

I mean, mayor advice anything else go by, would maybe even try suggestions, mechanic mayor conflicting opinions go mechanic, ... know, knows stuff.  Kinda fucked someone says ‚Äòworld over?‚Äô first reaction think whether spanish flu tanked economy 20‚Äôs  Thats exponential growth.

Starts really slowky, picks speed, explodes. brother finished Pfizer shots late Feb. went India May got infected Delta variant day landed India. got fever third day tested positive 5 days landing. Fortunately, long term damage recovered fine. 

I got vaccines May went June. airport. came back US fine. Definitely denying hospitalizations deaths affecting vaccinated people. I‚Äôm concerned severity ‚Äúmild‚Äù ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù infections post vaccination. 
Maybe think accept severe flu-all I‚Äôm asking statistics robust tracking. absence feel masking social isolation way till see evidence next months. won‚Äôt strict 2020 since I‚Äôm vaccinated - things non negotiable( gym sports) I‚Äôm hoping get clearer picture severity post vaccination infections  ROLL covid TIDE!!!!! Totally agree. point sympathy vaccinated could vaccinated due LEGITMATE medical issue. 'this shit' mentiones COVID-19 pandemic.

Like said, think covid going away. whatever Flordia affect slightest. now, serious illness preventable. 

A friend mine got second moderna shot months ago, stuck home least another week leave house got covid delta. 

Her report mild annoying throat itch bit cough morning. Mild headaches, runny nose wont quit. Oh god keep trying reply comment auto mod keeps removing it. word pansy way.

You may reading incorrect information. Current studies show vaccines still highly effective Delta.

There evidence Pfizer moderately less effective preventing symptomatic infection, nearly equally effective preventing severe illness death. 

If vaccinated safe be. 100% right choose wear mask makes feel comfortable. Wut? affecting 405 since pandemic starts, first wave really knocked health officers start 2021. injection Sinovac AZ first semester, death doctors decreased significantly. Unfortunately, can't see data regarding health officers death post-vaccination. 

But second wave finally hit larger population - unvaccinated commoners. Delta spread really crazy, despite Indonesia comparably high amount vaccine injection, percentage still low, victims start counting in. I've noticed too. Dutch folks even laughing me, ""the silly Belgian"" mask on.
Well sorry, I'm fully vaccinated yet sure hell know guys looks I'm keeping mask distance.  took November reach peak, year start pandemic. long taken time? 6-8 weeks so. I'm quoting vaccine hesitant noobs. Stop beating stupid monkey stick. Dude sauce r\selfawarewolves. 'this shit' mentiones COVID-19 pandemic. Florida always continue glory hole US, anything folks touch hit shot penicillin. Buddy, clearly read rest post shot hip here....you're funny guy. stop constant sinovac bashing. anyone good u/SaltMineSpelunker u/Viewfromthe31stfloor correct

For reason reminds brown widows US... slowly killing black widow population. species still around, one taking over.  mean, hand count sex... True, that's biggest issue. Hopefully someone eventually thinks law system would enough balance checks deal problem. Study Israel concluded efficiency 67% Delta

&amp;#x200B;

the 95% efficiency Pfizer always bs two groups Republicans.

1. small number intelligent, wealthy, powerful people, lie use second group increase wealth power.
2. much larger number uninformed, relatively poor people, misled used first group.

The first group includes people profit illness. increase profits power, need volunteers willing become sick even die. hope public safety wins out. far, least CA. dont believe states definitely didn‚Äôt. political fortunes wrapped pretending covid doesn‚Äôt exist. widespread vaccine availability there. shows complete futility lockdowns developing countries. *Natural selection* Covid deadly enough simply purge anti-vaxxers away. Ebola. Question data? family heading week weekend. Without me.  shit end say does

Depends mean ""this shit"". mean covid, expect going ""end"". mean lockdowns mask mandates, I'm pretty sure end people Florida collectively decide does. that's something actually control. ended months ago, doubt going back, guess see. reading bad information. Current vaccines still provide excellent protection even Delta.

There evidence Israel Pfizer moderately less effective preventing symptomatic infections Delta. still excellent job preventing severe illness death.

99% Covid-19 deaths happen unvaccinated people.

edit: Feel free keep wearing mask. Nothing wrong 100% right makes feel safer. need live fear every variant. Assuming half infected, wonder death numbers relatively low ? One point? still widely held belief.  Getting vaccine loving neighbor. Regular vaccines I‚Äôm fine with.  take dead weakened material body learn deal it.  previously stated, don‚Äôt feel need take experimental emergency authorized vaccine something currently feel I‚Äôm risk for. it‚Äôs fully FDA approved, ever, feel much better taking shot. plan getting I‚Äôm completely comfortable benefits/risks feel risk. Sorry calling way Indians started migrating US. Also general seemed wear masks? Well supply AZ extremely volatile due India blocking exports got hit hard spring; AZ whole suffered extreme supply chain problems (Canada got easy compared EU). Plus basically every public health agency recommending AZ+mRNA better protection anyway. get worse coverage mixing. 18 million doses means statistically 180 cases blood clots, total. Pretty obvious benefits outweigh risks. Guillain-Barre also potential side-effect flu vaccine. good know risks, hope dissuade people getting vaccinated. think mask mandates lifted? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Do realize little effect global scale spread unvaccinated people one country has?

American, ""show papers"" go one state another thats problem. thats exactly states called for. cant compare drivers licenses vax passports. two things vastly different. vax passports anything else? right. 

If want travel another country, require kind proof vax, makes total sense. already thats country requires.

But no. disagree thought government asking questions want move place place within country. Thats China example comes in. cant move without kind question government (in China) 

If pandemic showed us anything, showed government far indecisive unprepared even hinting possibility telling people this.

The fact matter one freeist countries planet(hell even England cant speak government) people want. Dont want wear mask? wont. Dont want get vaxed? wont. die? Maybe. Probably healthy.

The way change implement laws going it, accepted general public, would mean nice shiny pathway laws accepted future room implement similar laws things ""because keeps us safe"". postponed canceled Thank reply! know what's less effective Chinese vaccines? vaccine Personally, believe vaccine works extremely effective. say yo protection outright falsehood. low chance getting virus. 

You free manage risk however see fit (kids gross, I'd wear mask fear diseases), anti-vax sentiment rooted science. you‚Äôre convinced parts article allude prejudices hicks substantiation unwilling consider parts actually substantiated interviews data confirm issues accessibility? alcoholic can't get new liver. personal choices prevent medical procedures already. apprehension things closed, getting sick.  necessarily think mixing-and-matching bad thing, even think justifiable.

However, cannot believe number nations actually it. least first, *wasn't* data safety efficacy strategy. would think Western bureaucracy would allow happen.

I've impressed FDA US rigidly insisting follow usual process, speeding things allowing certain things happen parallel. course, comparatively easy US this, given massive vaccine access. Arkansan, hate right now. I‚Äôm surrounded non masking antivaxxers. It‚Äôs scary. decisions made Republican local goverment I‚Äôm it. 

Also, governor ended federal pandemic relief weeks ago ‚Äúforce‚Äù people back workforce. Helllooooooo covid hotspot. Could show me? I've seen projections. 100 preliminary reports Guillain-Barr√© detected 12.8 million doses Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine administered, Centers Disease Control Prevention said statement. cases largely reported two weeks vaccination mostly men, many aged 50 years older. mean 18s? look quickly [stats break age seems 50+ received doses? Trust me, too. it‚Äôs easy throw arms reality simple. Why? vaccinated, matter.  guys got enough Delta spread get spike. Mark words: 3 weeks US boat UK. cold? I‚Äôm sorry. must heartbreaking.  One kiddo mainly GI symptoms like stomachs aches, diarrhea, also headaches, chills fever. pretty sick three four days. periods would seem absolutely fine hours curled ball couch sudden. Several days later, daughter tested positive mostly cough, congestion, headache slight fever. case didn‚Äôt seem bad. absolutely way UK 10% infected. likely double even triple that. cannot use confirmed cases, they'll always massive undercount. get rough estimate looking IFR. 

If use IFR .65%, seems pretty safe IFR estimate, comes 19,584,000 infections (128,000x154). UK population roughly 68,000,000. 

19,584,000√∑68,000,000 = 28.8% previously infected. Even used higher IFR, would still show least 20% naturally acquired immunity. problem, still learned something exchange! seriously?

Ok, think discussion run course arguing argue point. 

Goodbye nice day. don‚Äôt think medical community federal government incite panic, people create themselves. lol many shots gonna get till over? know someone getting vaccinated this.

I say 1 cycle shots ilmy period abnormal. second month back track back normal. husband's employer. contact customers employees must fully vaccinated show CDC card HR prove it. insurance company includes adjusters, people local branch offices, whoever working person corporate offices. jobs done home, can't. Also employees deal directly customers must wear masks so, despite fully vaccinated. I'd like think people charge extra diligent, cover butts liability context. Nobody try say adjuster gave Covid came inspect property adjusters masked vaccinated. What's solution protecting him? [5,186 breakthrough cases 157m people health risk. That‚Äôs incorrect. EUA specifically non approved medicines per section 564 Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act), Secretary HHS declares emergency use authorization appropriate, **FDA may authorize unapproved medical products unapproved uses approved medical products used emergency** diagnose, treat, prevent serious life-threatening diseases conditions caused CBRN threat agents certain criteria met, including adequate, approved, available alternatives. ""While Israel seen increase number daily infections recent weeks, severe cases increased slightly deaths recorded.""

No lockdowns, period. problem mRNA vaccines types (viral vector, inactivated, protein, DNA, etc.) issue well? point, even pro-vax people get tired get jabbed every six months deal usual side effects (headache, fever, etc.) couple days small still existent risk serious side effects (heart inflammation mRNA, blood clots viral vectors, dunno others). I'm sure GREAT vaccine uptake. think anti-vaxxers move goalposts.

I'm sure will. couple threads Pfizer talking [FDA? CDC?] booster shot, **lot** comments trying convince government needed booster wanted money would bring in. done right. shot protects things mentioned. groups pay higher insurance rates, sometimes much 4x average rate payer. turn keeps rates since things. 

So yeah, people able get shot refused pay higher rates based example. Bro. article people would surprised find earth fact round flat. people surprised anything. took generalized saying things like ""everyone thinks"" ""the expectations are"". No, everyone think expectations large that. Yes dumbasses surprised. surprising. Immunity vaccine lasts least 6 months, probably lot, lot longer, probably many years. looking like it'll permanent semi-permanent good portion population.

This thing gives hope. plenty available snooze lose unfortunately. already EUA, mean it‚Äôs approved. man Taiwan buys lot stuff China, like everything. could say majority Taiwan manufacturing industry located China. worrying supply chain, dealt 30 years ago. non-issue.

The real reasons are:

1. current ruling party based whole campaign China bad propaganda. buy straight China it'll hurt politically.
2. later even supporters want vaccines whatever source, still refuse make move. revealed high rank people stakes locally developed vaccines. profiting blocking imported vaccines.  prevent getting vaccinated taking precautions. wife's cousin works Hospital Springfield, MO area. fairly conservative railing people online please get vaccinated, keep wearing masks haven't.  get saying. even acknowledge level people screw everyone see disagrees them. ultimately people easily harnessed others often seek profit express expense others makes accessory, however unaware. Dr. Johnson said:

""Patriotism last refuge scoundrel.""

They must stopped. murderer murderer greed desperation that's something resolved stop killing further. motivations relevant insofar helps us deal them. haven;t seen anything far suggest helped anyone except 'handlers' one bit. 

They may kill endanger others variety reasons, none acceptable. one hand, (a) following scientific method (b) avoiding essentially completely unproven experiments human beings seem pretty important.

On hand, suppose desperate willing try anything.

It worked well cases (delaying second dose UK countries), well cases (hydroxychloroquine, various home remedies COVID, etc).

I guess hope get burned it..? still not-insignificant amount people incorrectly believe vaccine cost money. think offering money vaccine recipients decent way go this. Over/under change mind next week? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I'm 35 BC, still waiting text book second dose, 5ish weeks since first. Twain gtfo pretty fast though. died CT buried Elmira NY. make sound like Sikeston St Louis attitudes toward pandemic. I've fully vaxxed Pfizer since May still caught Delta variant 2 weeks ago. symptoms may bad, I'm curious know actual efficacy Pfizer vaccine Delta. little column A, little column B. 

The variants reduce efficacy antibodies circulating system. time, ""active"" antibodies immediately bind cells wanes body ""seen"" offending protein lately. 

These numbers made up, assume 'needs' 100 effective antibodies per unit volume neutralize infection begins. started 1000 antibodies shortly second dose means highly protected. time, slow exponential decay 200 antibodies per unit volume 6 months got vaccinated. original virus? Plenty protect you. Delta another variant reduces number antibodies effective 50-70%, 60-100 ""effective"" antibodies potentially vulnerable get infected. 

The reason vaccines still help severe disease body sees infection, immune cells say ""oh, hai, remember you!"" help attack infected cells pump massive quantities antibodies relatively early infection opposed body ""experiment"" different antibodies neutralize truly novel virus (this oversimplification course directionally correct). 

Getting another shot gets antibodies shoot high level again, providing protection (as well convincing body may make sense keep around bit longer) - even variant reduces efficacy bit.  Wear mask! That‚Äôs I‚Äôm :) even allowed students paint/color wear throughout week surprise :) asked evidence vaccine potentially asking 6 months. delivered news articles. Downvote want lol. record Pfizer delta cause extreme concern imo. not? 86% adults vaccinated summer things bit control.

One dose vaccine protect Delta variant. number therefore much smaller. i'll go one further.

Curious know symptoms they‚Äôre since aren‚Äôt vaccinated! really story that, positive tests performed three days negative tests, partying close quarters. two days‚Äô time, number infections risen 124 350 participants, knew could go fast. 

The tour group sent everybody test positive put negative tested people two buses hope infections...

The tour group 35% infection rate. likelihood, even tests perfect, someone bus incubating infection detectable yet. Madrid Brussels 14 hour drive never stop, probably trip two days, long enough infection become contagious. Bullshit. overwhelming evidence work - Sinovac \- cheap speculations (like ""study"" Facebook post 10 data samples) &amp; media fear-mongering side zero academic works. assertion article many people could surprised amount deaths. 

it claim death historically high. mean personally surprised. means deaths could get higher people's expectations (and people seeing headlines vaccines working well we've seeing zero deaths entire countries). 

Do understand that? talking number compared expectations, many people's expectations (understandably) low deaths. mean indeed borders think abolished possible.

Telling germany halt road traffic country impossible. Cargo needs move cannot simply fully close border.

Borders dont much connected areas. Small european countries better large european countries despite border close per capita speak. divided entire world even countries borders would done better think. Agreed, pretty funny hero helped speed vaccine development process yet refuse treatment. Could put better. Lockdowns inconvenience, especially less fortunate. feel every student living alone 18m^2 shed (and small town student accomodation, go Munich 10m^2 half-reasonable price hard come by), expected study 8h day said 18m^2 shed. feel every lower income family living small 1 bedroom appartments garden, balcony next space themselves. feel every 16/17/18/19/whatever year old wants live celebrate best days life, least small circle (let's face it, big, 500 people parties need right now). feel everyone list seriously restricted way life lockdowns.

I'm saying scientific evidence gave support vaccinated people wearing masks wrong, wrong way significant bearing use support point, way I'm fairly certain would admit brought attention. Given scenario vaccinated people represent non-miniscule percentage population, reduction cross-infection due non-linear nature R-values means vaccinated peopled ""risk-equivalent"" unvaccinated people much higher ratio individual protection percentage would suggest.

Earlier chain, talked hypothetical 5% reduction R-value (from 2 1.9) wearing masks would translate 60% reduction cases 20 ""generations"". using ""risk equivalent"" rules used vaccinated people would say 20 people wearing masks would equivalent 19 people wearing masks. think pretty clear that's true all, reason true vaccinations, either.

An argument vaccinated people wear masks social reasons, promote hygiene responsibility volatile time, fine. there's case mask-wearing among vaccinated population meaningful effect actual spread disease. Came scratching head thing.   , companies need legally liable incase people get adverse reactions. suffered extreme tinnitus moderna vaccine , rare documented side effect according ENT doctor. tried seek legal help told since vaccines yet FDA approved paperwork sign getting vaccinated explicitly states moderna responsible side effects nothing could do. want mandate vaccine, make companies legally responsible like drug. Right hiding behind guise emergency approval. He‚Äôs also wrong. He‚Äôs assuming everyone given weeks supply, reality take time move vaccines point point B could easily using last weeks shipment.

Agree completely. sure compares countries No, .65% IFR (infection fatality rate). means .65% people infected succumb disease (on average). said, Norway easier time tracing since around 5.4 million people, whereas UK 68,000,000. well, UK much international travel hub, makes even difficult.

Also FYI, I'm U.S. similar issue confirmed cases way lower actual cases. But, again, we're massive travel hub 330,000,000 people. far pandemic, it‚Äôs established length time required inhale enough virons start infection. variant reduced time matter seconds, implications huge.

68.7% total population first dose 52% second dose.

That's higher Israel lot places. still week vaccinations go re-open (and course we'll continue vaccinate re-open).

Vaccines work - didn't, risk re-opening. doctors properly diagnose patients rare event occurs. good rare risks communicated. worries though Russia whose Sputnik vaccines type (Vector) Janssen/AZ. Unlike say UK always used mRNA vaccines, little availability there.

The Sputnik vaccine uses two different vectors though second one affected vector immunity (we keep learning new words...) AZ is.

Dr. Gastaldo adds know vaccines highly effective preventing hospitalizations deaths breakthrough cases, don‚Äôt know level protection asymptomatic infection fully vaccinated.

The Lambda variant far identified 26 countries already, including United States. Source? Yes, said would useful ultimately think discriminatory would stand court. Thats happened half restrictions Czechia. quite difficult moral question. still non-zero risk death major vaccines full immunity (10 days second shot). Cases breakthrough rare. Cases death breakthrough even rare. confuse rare safe. Yet large urban communities vaccination rates low. downvoting state facts.  city 96 percent dems. Lower vaccination rate pub majority counties state. Thi Im forced vaccination  brainer. Right requiring food workers wash hands. Things change needed, things enacted persuade. 

For example, show proof vaccination go college, get job, go concert? 

I think ultimately necessary, perhaps done even necessary, there's stuff theoretically could done raise vaccination rates needed. vaccination people must allowed choice still!!!

Employers allowed choice regarding hire guessing haven‚Äôt even gotten first shot yet. option patronize businesses require vaccinations. respecting rights businesses people want close proximity unvaccinated people? ""true freedom"" stop reaches rights? got phone mother law Arizona. knows five breakthrough infections among friends past week (she directly exposed, infected). seniors, fully vaxxed Pfizer, confirmed via PCR, moderate symptoms. knows many asymptomatic infections spread. one end CDC‚Äôs tracked list breakthrough illness, weren‚Äôt hospitalized.

Which, yay, vaccine it‚Äôs job really, really sucks CDC isn‚Äôt gathering stats this, it‚Äôs clearly becoming frequent Delta variant seems lot people don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs possible. dad moderate case GBS, likely due flu shot. wanted get COVID vaccine, despite risk GBS coming back. wait bit thankfully CDC eventually okayed mRNA vaccines people GBS. I‚Äôve never seen call around appointment fast (normally tends procrastinate medical stuff). Healthcare workers already required get TDAP MMR vaccines. sure anyone would tripping one more. consultant hired authority urged NYCHA managers notes week week kickstart stalled plan improve air circulation bathrooms kitchens fixing old mechanical ventilation systems plagued busted roof fans clogged air ducts.

If live someone covid-19, better fan bathroom stop getting it.  Lol getting downvoted, but, yeah. vaccinated, worry wearing masks indoors.  proper diet exercise alternatives healthy? injecting healthy way coronavirus?  believe idea is: *can* it‚Äôs unlikely. seconds everyone, spread Australia would wayyyy worse. people, literally way could infected small passing interaction. commonsense aint common no‚Äômo- we're talking vaccinated people, routine boosters small price pay sense normality. site currently unavailable visitors European Economic Area work ensure data protected accordance applicable EU laws.

Would someone kind? Asia? google Mongolia. mean Delta? Google ""Delta virulence"". never going rid covid. It‚Äôs going endemic. US aren‚Äôt vaccinated that‚Äôs them. can‚Äôt change minds part. I‚Äôm going lockdown wear masks till end time. It‚Äôs reasonable expect people know won‚Äôt happen. either get living stay home what? Forever? part article matters - ‚ÄúTentatively speaking, appears Lambda variant covered quite nicely current vaccines,‚Äù encourages OhioHealth‚Äôs Dr. Joseph Gastaldo. US weird thing pick stance facts. Like hats exist. obviously do, US fine chose believe not. even polls asking random people street belief facts. somewhat strange.  ü¶çü¶ç based France  stupidly apathetic towards destructive misanthropic practices helping either. think understand kind carbon footprint we're talking here. everyone flew like OP, world would end today. Throwing whataboutisms solve problem. enlightened, lazy complacent call corporations *and* worst worst individuals once. Well, talking mom friends day fully convinced need take tetanus booster get infected.

Like... that's vaccines work. get infected vaccinated/boosted straight give antibodies, thing, dangerous way expensive.

I find really quite absurd 2021 there's people *still* understand vaccines work. remember learning elementary school. Foxconn Taiwanese company assemble phones country.

This vaccine supply tensions China made COVID response difficult Taiwan. unique political situation Yea political / cultural moment sure makes clear keep company. Workers continue showing call charity. calling motels? Something like hotel door opens outside ventilation system separate? Australia motel style places? Stop blaming individual people start blaming big corporations actually contribute meaningful amount pollution. Attacking one office worker won‚Äôt give good karma buddy. next Brazil help also country resources capital. rest country mostly indigenous people resources Lima. Also people go everyday buy groceries true markets small heavily populated. somewhat distant room, like upstairs they're could work would need wear mask windows open high volume air filter. think that's define offensive...

Offensive meaning it'll harm someone, case, Chinese vaccines net gains countries access options.

Anyway topic here. talking biotech vaccine Taiwan refused import distributed Chinese company.

So saying better let people die rather buy vaccine? can't compare BC Europe, compare Asia-Pacific?

I'm saying government waited month vaccination rate higher. Oh nice! checked lower uptake first doses BC likely explains access earlier Province.

The difference less 2% first doses, make 10% difference second doses. reason young people Ontario got second dose faster provincial government targetted urban hot spots rural communities, urban hotspots skew much younger.

Taken literally, would actually new news. read article, really says vaccinated infected develop severe illness asymptomatic. 

The ""or"" lot work there. give us real idea many simply asymptomatic. lot people still never stopped traveling work. 30 corporations responsible 80% greenhouse emissions. Focus energy there, shaming someone Reddit pushes people away argument. Spanish plane flew already COVID last 6 months greenlight vaccinated sorry argument stand ! Well think say vaccines can't used offensively. 
 
I sure that. 
There reservations accept vaccines made Russia China, based insufficient information adequacy testing. able effectively sue tinnitus even companies liability. Since disclosed side effect, assumed risk. though tinnitus highly unpleasant, tends go away leave permanent injury could compensated for. terms herd immunity, yes is.

I would disagree remember vaccinated peoples get virus too. Four people office vaccinated. female. One African American, Covid last year traveling Las Vegas weekend trip. One South American it. Two Caucasian. Two Democrats, Two GOP. Sometimes political party. Sometimes health care provider age. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wish would get vaccinated, employer, cannot force to. want forced vaccinations, best watch things forced people future. Getting Hitleresque truly scary. Lmao fucking what?? US sold stadium ina. Major city fans clogging streets. even close studies causes natural immunity covid first place? terms diet exercise? Like studies stating vitamins responsible? guess country proper health care system able track vaccine related issues. Irregardless downvotes, I, unfortunately live country neither proactive reactive. Finger pointing us usually remedy failure work shift take time view thing posted assumed Google data I'd seen already would recent data. That's important. Starting August, people public places (shopping malls, restaurants, bars, theaters, movies, hospitals, trains, planes...) show ""health pass"". pass valid either fully vaccinated, either negative test less 48h.

This rule valid anybody places, visitors, customers workers.

Basically, makes vaccination mandatory million workers, make life complicated vaccinated. could test every two days impractical. high horse? people realize literally billions people die near future climate crisis we're actively exacerbating? kind forced people travel ""several times month"" pandemic?

3. people. No. EU‚Äôs purchasing scheme allowed nations buy one, countries still placed individual orders. Supply different across nations, example Denmark getting 2 million Pfizer doses month iirc, we‚Äôve already received them.

The line get second dose yesterday long. bit irritating personally, nice thing see societally. Rant over. Pretty sure already Iv fully vaccinated. Felt bit weather day. Kept clearing throat. Well think say vaccines can't used offensively. said weapons. that's big difference. Assuming USA, true can't sue Moderna. However, lawyers mentioned possible get relief government. (IANAL, could also wrong). Either way, get better soon. California large minority population large number poor people, vaccination rates 20 points higher. California pregnant women like Arkansas. got vaccine rural area problem, giving pharmacies Walmart rural areas.

Can show California‚Äôs access public health measures correlates Arkansas‚Äô instances? normally perform same? Otherwise comparing seems totally baseless. 

The least substantiated parts article focus. I‚Äôm suggesting it‚Äôs prejudice, explain otherwise? people already COVID. Gonna force vaccine benefit all?

It actually benefit them. Thanks, think we'll need it. feels scary going this. I've got Irish relatives chatting loads Irish peeps booking dental appointments Ibiza, using reason travel, going holiday. Dentists island kicking mass bookings one turning up... Considering move ""higher tier"" simply taking FREE vaccine widely proven safe, yes. is, fact, great plan.

Eventually people get tired get tested time everyone around get damn vaccine. close call ex-husband took unvaccinated son NHL playoff game (against protestations). 18 thousand unmasked, screaming fans sitting cheek jowl area 32% vax rate (at time, we've eked 37% since).

Within 4 days, ex (Pfizer, February) developed symptoms. son, masked game cuz mama raised rightüòâ, remained covid free. Ex went infect 3 vaccinated people.

I also really bothered someone choosing fruits&amp;veg. select quantity - want exactly 8 honeycrisps idea translates weight, often end ridulous amount bell peppers 3 apples. 

Glad well - stay safe friend :) think vaccine causing virus itself, immune response triggered body, probably someone already susceptible developing GBS.  bring back production developed countries lock borders. 
 
That goes ways. someone vaccinated yet think making difference wearing masks indoor, surely can't allow restaurants open right? coffees, right? even bars, right? Exactly, I'm already hearing people talk like anecdotal stories, saying knew they'd still catch even gotten vaccinated. love reference lot people asymptomatic mild disease Covid-19 ""what's point?"" saying probably get boosters future versions now. really dumb. can't communicate Latinx populations minorities way would affluent areas.

Wut. probably job bro. may require travel thats everyone. Get high horse. life-saving used defensively.  think bars specifically caused rises. Bars opening BC Alberta summer 2020 (with restrictions) cases spike 2nd wave October. 

Data scientists smarter go numbers make theories, indoor gatherings weather got worse, key events like Thanksgiving Christmas seem much likely causes spread people going pint capacity-reduced bar. Famous laat words... thing. majority population vaccinated longer watching case numbers. watching hospitalisations making sure shoot levels overwhelm health services.

Here UK we're midst infection spike thanks delta, hospitalisations subsequent deaths, increase slightly, nowhere near bad tracked infections spiked. 

And there's signs infection rate flattening theory drop back time another spike two weeks next Monday remaining restrictions axed. time, three weeks roughly now, another ~7 million people second vaccination jab, position different Yeah know attempting sarcastic fine Poor, sad Typhoid Mary. won‚Äôt anybody consider *her* rights? Even best PCR can‚Äôt detect disease well four days exposure. Yup, makes sense really. odds health complications AZ much lower covid itself. low income country can't afford vaccinate population best possible vaccine, lot better nothing.

As mixing viral vector mrna vaccines, looked into. *Wtf wore seatbelt still broke arm, seatbelts useless!* Also since see article, trials done effectiveness third shot shot dark? look statistics, shows literally less 1% vaccinated getting Delta variant. par even better ""superior"" ones people refer like mRNA vaccines.

Of course nothing say probably work, dream. Anecdotal examples don‚Äôt mean shit, especially COVID considering majority people mild flu like symptoms. could easily point someone know got COVID fine within week severe symptoms I'm India delta variant swept country apr/may severe ventilator oxygen shortages lots people died. Reddit full comments like 'its shitty country ignorant folks, expect'. see thing happening developed nations access vaccines medical facilities. 

My country opened month months state-wise lockdown every one started moving around going vacations probably going see thing round3 around September. Sounds like convention going super spreader event delta variant. fun. Instead every yokel who‚Äôd kiss ring telling people grandma grandpa happy die economy. that‚Äôs proof pathological issues, idk.  Sounds like corpo corrupted gov tbh. Especially media slander. EU recommending anything. get corpo lobbyists too. And? think going put stop us? expecting corporate donors suddenly grow conscience? better day starts start moving. It‚Äôs impossible single it‚Äôs illegal force someone show private medical records. Huh, TIL I‚Äôm expert. think idea it‚Äôs making nasal passages/sinuses inhospitable virus set shop replicate, turn prevents getting foothold going full-blown, since nose usually ground zero. (Not COVID-19, common respiratory words, set base camp nose, replicate invade. usable base camp, replication, invasion.

I think that‚Äôs simplified idea, anyway. doctor virologist.  Sorry hear this. timeframe doses? Hope recovery quick. make difference one two vaccines? Also, certainly choice refuse vaccine, fine puts others risk. Hopefully they're made social pariahs rest us get lives.

The vaccine working experts hoped would. spike protein circulating throughout body often times crossing blood brain barrier. I'd understand someone wanna take vaccine. Yeah spoiled assholes I‚Äôm glad done goodwill trickling never said conservatives shouldn‚Äôt change messaging. should. doesn‚Äôt mean liberals shouldn‚Äôt change messaging too.

Like, let‚Äôs say, purely hypothetical scenario, conservatives changed messaging saw higher rates vaccination conservative demographics. would leave black people die covid far higher rates (and already likely die covid white people 3-4x) refuse acknowledge liberals also need fueling vaccine hesitancy messaging. favor saving conservative lives black lives? Don‚Äôt Black Lives Matter YOU?

I live borderline Asian enclave black enclave get interact members neighbors lot. I‚Äôm Asian nearly everyone Asian neighborhood eligible vaccinated vaccinated. black enclave next far lower rate unvaccinated. ask why, say don‚Äôt trust government suddenly care black lives didn‚Äôt care before. say hasn‚Äôt studies show vaccines effects people different races, terms efficacy well risks side effects. say risks vaccine side effects greater black people white people, government would release data wanted black people endure greater risks vaccination save white people, hold race-based studies released. say Tuskegee experiments showed willing American government scientific community intentionally subject black people harm ‚Äúfor greater good‚Äù science without informing black people harm imposed (in Tuskegee experiments, scientists researchers purposely withheld life saving treatment syphilis exclusively black experimental cohort study untreated syphilis affected human body, knowledge gained ‚Äúfor greater good science‚Äù black people‚Äôs expense, subjects never told happening, rather told receiving treatment syphilis). cite fact vaccine trials done cohorts black subjects underrepresented, racial data simply collected cases, plain fact truth. black people community refuse vaccination working class people working factories, warehouses, kitchens, construction, public transportation, public facing jobs throughout entire pandemic already saw outbreaks either already caught covid recovered, believe since never got sick immune, thus see reason vaccinate incur additional risk vaccine side effects protect virus feel already immune from, especially given points uncertainty listed above. notice black people often offered J&amp;J vaccine white people offered mRNA vaccines, feel suspicious black people treated differently white people. 

It‚Äôs easy believe vaccine hesitant stupid selfish conservative mouthbreathers, smart, analytical, risk-conscious black people hesitant naturally distrustful told black lives matter live racist society care whether black people live die.

Yes, conservative messaging needs change ‚Äî would mostly result saving white lives. wish save black lives, liberals need change messaging too. Unless don‚Äôt care black lives.

And here‚Äôs thing. Even believe conservative messaging poses greater proportional risk society whole, fact still remains black people like refuse vaccination, disparity greater injurious impact black people, even though doesn‚Äôt affect white people greater society much. care disproportionate number black people dying preventable deaths covid enough try understand much hesitation black communities, merely fighting conservative messaging, unlikely subscribe first place, ignoring concerns black people won‚Äôt move needle them. Unless think black people likely conservatives saved positive shift conservative messaging, need try least understand unique reasons black hesitation know specifically address them. Beyond saving black lives, many states requiring vaccination attend institutions higher learning access employment opportunities, would effectively shut black people higher rate rates hesitation remain unaddressed.

It‚Äôs insane explain depth it‚Äôs important address race based vaccine hesitation people claim care black lives care giving greater access education employment black people. It‚Äôs insane people think conservative hesitancy worth addressing, black hesitancy ignored dismissed. Thanks continuing post reminders check twiv. worried happening Canada loosen restrictions.

That‚Äôs experts yet know long protected getting sick recovering COVID-19. Even already recovered COVID-19, possible‚Äîalthough rare‚Äîthat could infected virus causes COVID-19 again.

This barely even argument, certainly persuasive one. Experts know long vaccinated immunity lasts either. several indications vaccinated natural immunity long-lasting. Cleveland study example. occur anyone five months study among 2579 individuals previously infected COVID-19, including 1359 take vaccine.

If willing blind observations ""peer review,"" support contrary conclusions guidance CDC based nothing assertion ""we know,"" may well shouting campaign slogans. 

The CDC goes shown vaccination provides strong boost protection people recovered COVID-19. Learn [why getting vaccinated safer way build protection getting need ""boost protection"" reinfection rate near 0%. boosted ""super immunity"" concept supported anything. Antibodies one component immunity, complex phenomenon fully understand. hyperlink goes page explains vaccinated safer acquiring natural immunity, someone immune. irrelevant someone already recovered COVID.

Nobody point anything beyond purely speculative theories little-to-no precedent suggests people recovered COVID benefit vaccination.

I've talked vaccine hesitant ppl, convinced get vaccine. 

They may say dont trust gov., sure, really believe personal danger them, vaccine safer COVID. careful one. Lockdowns NY jack shit (or even made worse, arguably), solve all. 10% vaccinated ppl + immunity previous waves result serious spike.

Nothing would make happier wrong. don‚Äôt know delta variant got Springfield, Missouri, didn‚Äôt get East Coast first.‚Äù

Have none people even *talked* truck driver? ""east coast"" one day away. seeing cases go northeast, baseline 1 case per 100,000, 10% 30% week week increases still pretty low case counts.

Except ones die, course. Isn‚Äôt one main anti-vaccine arguments ‚Äúit‚Äôs FDA approved‚Äù? article suggests hesitancy decline approved.

That said, think anti-vaxxers move goalposts. thing is, 95% efficacy applied hundreds thousands dice rolls. thousands breakthrough cases. thousands families rolling 1d1000 die come natural-1.

Wow new daily cases back 30k again? get vaccination preventing deaths hospitalizations man delta variant serious‚Ä¶ wonder point people think it‚Äôs getting control select individual nations (england, Scotland etc) see age specific data. 

The 16% figure wildly date, currently 55% 18-24 year olds England higher Scotland Wales. Canada around 60% 12 17

Our stupid vaccine regulator UK still let 12-17 year olds get vaccinated. 24 high 90% areas .

What's national figure age group? guess can't close 40% Canada still unvaccinated? can't kids, unless oldies inexplicable turning vaccines en masse.  dumb? feel like reverse psychology would work here. works wonders small kids exactly anti-vax knuckleheads brains work. gov say ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt force anything it‚Äôs wether want potentially save life life loved ones not‚Äù. going get vaccinated anyways viceversa.

b) 90% adults vaccinated. Yeah, true, mostly commenting felt previous response appeared say delta variant, could become endemic - even though many argued even would likely outcome. Whats plan then? Keep living shit life lockdowns, seeing frieds family going work/homeoffice fun freetime.

Thats life worth living people, want old life back. Even means facing low risk getting infected virus, even lower risk killing hospitalising (if vaccinated got covid sometime earlier last 2 years) 90% adults vaccinated.... certainly aren‚Äôt wearing masks around friends public places, may family refuses eat indoors anymore allow hold small children.

That sorts illegal though. Sure matters, UK data posted serious illness (hospitalization/death). showed vaccines (mix AZ Pfizer) real world reduced 2-3 times, nowhere near expected 90%+.

Hello, vaccinated since March moderna, bf got j&amp;j. tested positive covid experiencing pretty severe covid symptoms par friends covid first wave (unvaccinated) experienced worse. waiting hear back gene sequencing find delta variant. anyone else vaccinated sick covid? anti-vaxers invent statistics 99.42% time.  actual study multiple ""examples"" actual data would useful ""real world examples.""

a single data point random reddit comment useful slightest anything. GP, I‚Äôd schedule check-up! I'm curious - I've seen nothing COVID prevention months months, think I've come across anything explain *what* infected isolate/quarantine.

Like, ways ease symptoms? self-explanatory rest/fluids? Nice. also transistent lower morality (due delayed planned procedures mostly, skipping radical cancer treatments) first wave though. starting bite us ass already, hope that's case Australia. amount legitimately waiting full fda approval, probably many.

Edit: right though majority people. stories break heart. 

What vaccinated? ask make sort 'point', tragic, I'm trying figure happening breakthrough cases.  

Stay safe. wear school ID (my high school decades ago). proof vaccination, give little sticker throw it. differently colored ID even.

Kids must wear masks envy vaccinated kids, good thing. want vaccinated take mask off. Hell lets vaccinate school - matter idiot antivaxxer parents think it. couple times no, everyone Japan wears masks. enough people vaccinated lot counties. check occasionally I'm sufficiently depressed. Really? many talking about? vaccine get? family also lives MO. already prosper economically. 

Again, want believe people get deserve bad behavior punished extent makes big difference macro level. won't. Life fair like that. people reddit keep spreading fear, uncertainty, distrust vaccines banned disinformation. vaccines work yet want extend state fear we're in. No, I'm Los Angeles. worked vaccination site got mine early. agree. I‚Äôm saying right, it‚Äôs important actually understand reasoning opinion Id feel bad kids gave parent, parent died.

Charge child murder. really antivax though? wouldn‚Äôt say everyone doesn‚Äôt get flu vaccine antivax. don‚Äôt distrust vaccines think they‚Äôre harmful. think they‚Äôll able handle flu Read comments - really nailed think. Tangent, I'm dealing family worried vaccine, saying cure/not foolproof, can't explain enough never meant be.

Masks, social distancing, vaccines efforts mitigation. We'll still get sick, less jabs, right - COVID around forever. Better get vaccine, possible boosters future, live it. Israeli? that's extremely early, got offered first jab late June. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm wondering, especially since Sarah Huckabee Sanders likely Republican candidate governor Arkansas.   bad breath excessive spittle.  Right. since half people currently vaccinated won‚Äôt get subsequent boosters, virus continue circulate widely, causing return restrictions. Ah thanks informing me.  lol, good know I'm one hates constant Darwin references sub.

This disease, dangerous, kills \~1-2% infects. figure much, much less reproductive age. 

Nope, Darwin solving problem never believed *anything* strongly people seem believe bullshit. fed lot misinformation. paying lives misinformation. could go read it. choose listen bad actors. guy commented ‚Äúreal world examples‚Äù so‚Ä¶ far eachother. What's wrong dingbats? JHINA BAAAAAAD! Yeah, helping people around offends them. dare suggest something someone themselves?! UK numbers start skyrocketing month ago. yet see whether death rate follow. asap mean six weeks first vaccination, yes. There's minimum time needed jabs maximise efficiency. Actually, are. Read many times. Hell yeah electric bills us !   That's confusing way phrase it. women vaccinated 8 20 wks, 12% complications far, normally 10-26% pregnancies complications first 20 weeks. rest cohort still pregnant data still collected. point comparing Spanish flu clearly minimise harm risks COVID-19. Calm down. kids currently symptoms (im vacccinated theyre 6 theyre not)

nothing scary. pretty normal cold like symptoms. idea ill go get tested morning sure Covid cause severe long-term health problems among survivors. acting like mortality rate concern naive. Yea, kinda like that. 1 10 cases doesn‚Äôt develop long covid. 1 10 cases doesn‚Äôt even get hospitalized days. Stop spitting fake numbers study latest variant(s) less lethal first one came along far? thing. lot transmission happens symptoms even appear, assymptomatics also transmit. One human behavioural drivers behind 'encouraging' viruses adapt less virulent form fear people symptoms...causing isolated less likely transmit. extreme symptoms, difficult becomes transmit.

The fact cover whole range outcomes, nothing death, makes really uncertain could evolve less virulent form. Would great did, best possible outcome, virus affecting people wildly different ways plenty mobile carriers... Nice symptomatic neighbor lady actually sought us out, didn‚Äôt want unfriendly.

Just Arkansas things. Biggest problem right kids still ineligible /u/brother-trick correct here. Table 4 looks alarming, text article explains ""Among 1040 participants (91.9%) received vaccine first trimester 1700 (99.2%) received vaccine second trimester, initial data collected follow-up scheduled designated time points approximately 10 12 weeks apart; limited follow-up calls made time analysis.""

So first second trimester vaccine recipients completed pregnancies time publication, except 104 miscarriages... within range miscarriages expected early pregnancies. (Frankly, low end expected.) short term. can't think endemic virus slowly mutated lethal time. tends get selected against. 

Now vaccine factory ramped, least north america, new vaccines available high rate needed. 

I agree though circulate, sure want people do. Wait vaccines go life, else do? want people wear masks public forever, social distance, etc? certainly without actual cause. Cause feel right fully vaccinated. supposed take mask after-jab observation area observe better. that's well ventilated, socially distant space Huh. TDIL delta variant 4th variant Greek alphabet, common anti vax states Mississippi delta. many people around world shun getting vaccinated vaccine offered sinovac.

Currently visiting parents Arkansas. moved retire, LA. 

We met nice neighbor across street. Stood chatting, unmasked, dad vaxxed outdoors. Everyone left go home.

WTF. never see word ‚Äúsoaring‚Äù pandemic count lucky.  Vast numbers things tested, unfortunately handful anything. 

Treatment protocols worked though, gradually death rate even severe cases lowered. New flu shots aren‚Äôt needed year ‚Äúflu virus‚Äù. childhood vaccines (like measles polio) viruses haven‚Äôt updated mutants _ever_. It‚Äôs flu mutates particular way unlike viruses.  news vaccinated people die fear-mongering?

Thank you. 
Edit add: asap means 'as soon possible' try approach masks? trying make point saying necessity boost every immunization we've received life antibodies become undetectable quickly.  antibodies dissipate quickly form memory cells. annual flu vaccine follows idea. boost needed protect new expected strains covered previous flu vaccines.  wouldn‚Äôt say automaton, people skills much important say cell biology.  light life üé∂  give (dumb) reasons still getting vaccinated?

I can't explain especially since "" studying"" college anyone else family feels like willful ignorance can't broach subject her.  That's government's response popular Australia, we've little restrictions daily life virus kept outside away community vaccine could developed rolled out.    Honestly don‚Äôt expert. decent human comprehend this.   Seems like Switzerland needs government agency review complaints workers fine companies instead going legal battle. Correct I'm wrong, certain group people believe trying protect around you, makes little B? hope Pello affairs order, seem he'll last long attitude  I‚Äôm wasn‚Äôt talking specifically, meant don‚Äôt want people feel best. want making science informed decisions.   Well ofc need pay them. people also jobs, like everyone else. trying say everyone get everything free? vaccines 100%, good preventing severe disease. That's really important part this. deal little sick. mean, think indictment victim complex; look actual law there's mention anonymity, optionality, anything like that. 

Sure, spokesperson said it, they're allowed say anything- I'd rather written law.
Which begs question, it?

If want argue made law get ball rolling placeholder, that's fine- saying ""they'll make survey later"" text. 

But could've easily said ""Participation survey mandatory universities required fulfill survey quota; specifics discussed deliberated"".

If go policians spokespeople said, we'd seen Trump's taxes, healthcare plan, Mexico paying border wall, Obama's ""if like current physician/plan keep 'em"", etc.

Until words reflected legislation, see jump conclusions. 

Even add ""optional"" verbage later on, mean crazy approach apprehension point. 

I agree people framing like ""Ok gonna line name politicial affiliation gunpoint"", media sensationalism. free look scabdiver op why. 30 years ago would've hated japan nonstop I‚Äôm involved science . I‚Äôm expected believe anything. People literally say anything pass scientific. I‚Äôm skeptical all. still get sick wear mask, let‚Äôs honest, kids still stick hands mouths catch germs. However, less likely get illnesses badly. lose week pay every time come sick kids spreading viruses shouldn‚Äôt school first place.  Oh, that. sentence better formulated. People believe things mental intellectual problems.  understand sentiment. problem saying fuck em they‚Äôre variant incubators. Also, current covid vaccines don‚Äôt guarantee won‚Äôt get covid, pass on, potentially die. Oh hell yes. insurance think 20 dollars flu shot pay spot get it. Could be? going be. seeds sown. think people make science-based decision, conspiracy-based decisions. OK.  speak numbers percentages? 


Numbers paint picture tell us seriousness, percentages show us nothing except whether something rise fall.  I‚Äôm double vaxxed Pfizer. safe play outdoor contact sports (basketball) public park strangers? Republicans: care myself? don‚Äôt exact numbers front right reading something recently talking exactly much lethal OG COVID-19 significantly lethal due fact spreads much easier (usually due stronger spikes evolve different variants) carries higher viral load (making sicker) also makes spread faster.

I say work hospital seeing numbers go much month following CDC giving everyone green light take masks fully vaccinated (which lets real, people saying leave majority took off).

At one point didn‚Äôt deaths month patients hospital ICU delta variant (they tested positive specific strain lab) dying quicker % positive rate doubled week month don‚Äôt understand cheers like even Fox News hosts people glorify gotten vaccinated

 [ridiculous hear nonsense people graduate degrees high school diploma. There‚Äôs decent chunk country portion identity wrapped anti-vax propaganda. docs crazy train. guy Magic 8 ball. airport,No need announce departure. Yeah much wait see right now. Good news form seen vacinated folks 5 10 percent infections right now.

But yeah, people panicking like March 2020 online. leave house things feel normal. Agree, need remain consistent following guidelines. Many largest California school districts didn‚Äôt open CDC public health experts said could open. That's path logic. singled people refuse get vaccinated wear mask logic. missinformation. 

In opinion singled be, extremist become.

When missinformation there, lose lose type situation everyone.

With said, point single out, single out. . . think way fix leaders conservative movement right thing, won't. That's power money. ü§∑ Yes, never mention parties ‚Äúprominent Democrats‚Äù ‚Äúmainstream democrats‚Äù

Vaccinate ppl fast, maybe choose patients die of, like did. shit Trump almost died got vaccinated election really reason people keep playing stupid charade.  point 180¬∞ turns seems strange. Going mask straight full lockdown. hey, indeed low mortality rate excess deaths. Maybe right? We'll see. true. diminish roles nurses play, many simply nothing automatons.

Possibly, iodine deficiency go back pre iodized salt days. Also called ""goiter belt.""  saying vaccines work then. Two days said done sub, America pretty much back panic mode Delta variant. 

Guess we‚Äôre waiting boosters second generation vaccine now. Valid research would exist confirmed negative outcomes due vaccine. Yet random blogs Instagram posts keep banging supposedly common adverse effects. look happened astra vaccine, potentially linked deaths news everywhere, regulators around world seen fit use it. fact remains well 3 billion doses administered probably know people who've worst outcomes virus yet far fewer cases people who've received vaccine. never mentioned parties. said conservative messaging liberal messaging.

I haven‚Äôt done never claimed ‚Äúmainstream democrat‚Äù  said equal blame parties vaccine hesitancy. asked provide one mainstream democrat said question vaccines. whole point haven‚Äôt done it. Democratic Party doesn‚Äôt control advocacy groups say. Republican Party much controls representatives say. make chick magnet? Done sub. hitting head obvious stats fear mongering. rough analysis UK. lag 21 days peak deaths &amp; cases. Going back 21 days.UK around 20k cases (7 day moving average), last time range deaths around 400-500 27. never ever ever ever said prominent Democrats. said liberals liberal advocacy groups whose message promote. 

Please quote said prominent Democrats. think supposed drink sunshine inject bleach.  Oh. weather transmits flu? News me. that's messed up. show great divide, dropped Asian market SoCal last weekend literally every single customer besides one white dude masked up. Masking &amp; vaccines really seem push buttons certain group. really take personally. Wow! Never would've guessed -_- Thankfully big cruise lines require crew vaccinated part contract. No, really. It‚Äôs weather. That's advance we've ambulatory (that means walk, hospital) treatment IV monoclonal antibody treatments. reserved elderly people specific conditions (as article states).

Other rest, fluids, good diet.  bad reaction vaccine mean would suffered badly got virus? Given huge proportion world still unvaccinated, accusation hilariously far mark: immense demand worldwide Pfizer vaccines years come. ‚Äúleftover stock‚Äù consider. NYC here. Total opposite situation. people mostly maskless street, indoor shopping, subways, offices remain near 100 percent mask wearing. Indoor restaurants bit grey area, general public seems accepted indoor mask-wearing foreseeable future. 
I trouble understanding resistance wearing masks indoors (or vaccination, matter), guess I‚Äôm exposed put resistance. right sympathized - told understand little unnerving. way, vaccine comes out, sees get kids even though also nervous like her, might willing get kids. share articles/etc explain ok. Sympathizing friend really hesitant sharing couple trusted sources eventually worked get vaxxed thanked afterwards. Arguments work. possible tests different (though knowledge whether case). Higher-cycle PCR testing detect presence virus much lower threshold, associated ""cases"" generally quite mild terms symptoms lower rates transmission. I'd curious know testing standards two locales, group suffered ""serious"" illness. ad free! Arkansas!? lol kidding? took collective resources planet year bring control level still depending country likely still mutating.

If define control ability predict manage situation contained amount damage could call control. 

But definition, orderly retreat battle still losing overall could considered 'controlled situation'.

I think control virus final goal. defeat (and ideally annihilation) goal insofar possible. Cases CA went things opened since spread people Alpha aan den Rijn variant. Yeah, sure, people wish death others usually ones warn deaths suggest ways prevent them. watching Premier League international football might get impression, ultra culture bad worse countries like Italy Germany.  access secured shrewd negotiations good contract signings though.

In case covid, since spreads easily long somebody gets deadly ill evolutionary pressure simply evolve milder. hold r/Redditbets fast it'll make omega narrative one side false.

No one saying ""only one side."" absolutely majority one side. unvaccinated statistically far likely republican rather democrat. 80/20 rule much effect.

When strong majority present common English language refer problem whole. strong majority unvaccinated Americans republicans acceptable say systemic problem within republican party.

Only one party celebrates unvaccinated party strongly encouraging vaccinations. bet guess which.
 think massive reduction death rate US, might want ask want worst case scenario badly.

1. able discuss without accusing badly wanting worst-case scenario; shame you. 
2. missing point. point everybody thinks deaths over, a) still lot unvaccinated people many places, b) death rates go ICU's filled.

The ""surprising"" part many people death rate could larger people expect. even mean ""large"", ""larger expected"" since expect little death now. amount expectations (which very, low), absolute amount. Great info. really ""oh no, anyway"" though... People choosing get vaccinated affect many themselves.

My cousin lives Arkansas 2 year old going chemo leukemia right now. poor kid can't go public even see family people refusing get vaccinated. hospitalized twice last month contracting ***the common cold***. even comes near COVID...  Well, that‚Äôs true everyone basically fucked Thanks article. read forgive dumb.

I think put one article basis thesis. many variables - age, weight, sex, underlying health conditions, access free/affordable health care, climate, work conditions, public transport etc. - need multiple studies make effective conclusions. 

For me, I'd rather mRNA jab 2nd, that's based wanting cover variants fully scientific analysis. moment, I'm scheduled 2nd AZ jab next week. Hopefully, either UK gov give everybody 3rd different previous I'll able buy one.  get tired seeing comments too. can't say kill entire state breath say haha kidding. Dont dick long them. Everyone optimistic left living lives happily. people left always terrified.  Reinfections real, happening throughout pandemic, mean natural infection provide protection reinfection. Breakthrough infections post vaccination happening too, mean vaccinations giving significant protection. Ofcourse important assess protection natural immunity vaccine induced immunity long lasting persist despite emergence variants concern. far news good. glad took leopard ripping face realize dumbass Correct. balance. ""oh well, since still risk, anything"" Well testing facility Spain sucks! another variant? *are* varied. Surveys shown circumstances really small percentage hardcore anti-vaxxers. rest convinced, maybe trip doctor trust, maybe incentive like $ (especially since people busy childcare unable take work). Maybe need questions answered instead treated like idiot (which difficult definitely needs done). Thanks!  I‚Äôm also KC metro young kid. one families know still trying prevent kid getting covid. thought sending back preschool fall, kids class siblings public school won‚Äôt masking, think may continue wait. point won‚Äôt anything else do, I‚Äôm keeping home kindergarten next year. want badly him, still choices make might prevent lifelong complication, can‚Äôt justify choosing risk behalf. Eventually scale tip, guess. Merciful heavens. part state in? often worry family north part state. many anti-vaxxers crazy conservatives close borders?  they're told sit cheer that's they're trying get 'untold' people follow along. 

That's every bit bad. we're looking people working create terrible result case rather results they're hoping create. professional experience seeing fully vaccinated people showing ICU? so, outcomes? happy family received yours. come back work office year ago relief vaccine brought immense. I'm glad anxiety gone. I‚Äôm MO. Springfield MO‚Äôs ICU‚Äôs max capacity. Parsons (our shitty governor) says there‚Äôs issue. We‚Äôre see lot pointless deaths across state. Except that's assumption making. far variants controlled currently available vaccines. given evolution able escape neutralizing antibodies, let alone T-cell recognition. spike protein bind many ways. mean Trump's bragging created vaccine months that's convincing people get it. reaction vaccine actual illness could affected many things: stress, sleep, hydration, illnesses, etc. Unfortunately, doubt already has. really know trust here. Pfizer, large corporate, normally fall trusted advisor category, together Israeli study, claiming booster needed seems legit. FDA CDC saying warranted. Normally I'd trusting independent scientists, FDA CDC biased last years, hard time trusting too.

So, I'm getting booster soon available, bitter angry all.  Yes. However, UK borders closed event guests world? understand people want easen measures.

Why start making fat people exercise unhealthy tye risk obese brings. 


I also think people posted McDonald's restaurant scale weigh 180 probably think getting better options instead cramming fat face further. Yeah Sweden euthanized elderly people keep way Wearing masks outside doesnt much.  really curious hear sinovac followed mRNA vaccine. Thank you, makes sense think correct word mutated. virus learn. long since second dose?   governor charge gets vaccines?

Or individual people deciding whether get vaccine? right, protection relative. talking 30% 60% so. Indonesia's population younger compared countries like England Italy. Also lack testing means many Covid infections deaths reported. person 12+ wants vaccine access.


People 1-17 get vaccine yet. seen data yet. 

But would need see convince booster needed rather money grab?  live Arkansas got vaccine. diagnosed covid yesterday. Went 4th July event guess shouldn‚Äôt dropped mask soon.. Sure hope suffer much. vaxed infection data read article? African Americans, make large percentage population south, skeptical historical mistreatment. Reddit loves shit south so, taking big shit lot black folks. thought read something data given US health officials soon. 

In fact, topic article meeting US health officials discuss boosters, may data given them. evidence vaccines continue effective now? gamble. Infection rates UK soaring deaths &amp; hospital admissions climbing. numbers deaths still small there's lot room third wave get much bigger.

Whilst there's much transmission happening, there's lots opportunity variants emerge. Worse yet, vaccinated still able infected population produces ideal conditions mutations may get better evading current vaccines.

I accept there's lots factors play government's scientific advisors clearly uneasy relaxing restrictions July 19th. give everyone pause thought. figured would still see spike deaths cause death testing according ecuadorian covid vaccine tracker (aka Ecuador vaccinated

I dont think US really tracking breakthrough cases. Maybe states are? Masks outside practically pointless.  alberta's prepping join there.

fuck jason kenney. So, case increased infectiousness UK variant, increased deadliness vaccine-avoidance South African variant? 

well sound good. Currently, COVID+ inpatients fully-vaxxed (small hospital) serious conditions--cancer+on chemo, elderly+robust medical history, etc. anecdote, breakthroughs happen. look statistics elders (65+) getting vaccinated, Oklahoma 84%, Arkansas 78%, Missouri 81%.

/s Versus Kentucky, Department Education barely exists necessarily. new disease right limited options treatment prevention probably always case. 

Honestly, accept agree argument ultimately going live virus. Delta variant really, really infectious numbers UK quite alarming. Daily deaths gone 5-8 around 25-30 space month. said, I'm still accepting facts gamble let infection rates soar like doing. Double jabbed people still infected ill (my sister currently positive unwell OK). info, man pretty obvious states 60s 70s southern states aren't... making bed... Close contacts isolate certain amount time (I forget is). However, MLB season, team reached 85%+ vaccinated, close contacts longer isolate, there‚Äôs less mandatory testing, bunch relaxations covid rules. Unfortunately, Phillies one handful teams able reach 85% threshold. It‚Äôs unclear many guys close contacts, would bet tested positive, particularly since it‚Äôs Bohm reported. Hopefully miss time like unnecessarily wake call Phillies whichever teams yet reached 85%, although based boneheaded, disheartening comments I‚Äôve read various players team, I‚Äôm exactly optimistic will.

-signed, embarrassed disgruntled Phillies fan Marxism form social analysis focused material conditions productive relations   U must fucking balst parties bud. expression... Like 'nobody going dance's litteraly mean 0 humans.

Get fucking life. Nope, got tests Spain everyone group go quarantine. That's group split positive negative people loaded separate buses. Wearing masks indoor public spaces big deal. sure like music üé∂ Well we‚Äôre fucked. good number Americans don‚Äôt give fuck anyone else. Jesus that's low blow lol. Technically no, hey, young claim level protection bad?

How many people BionTech, Moderna, J&amp;J, AstraZenaca got infected? sit compare? 60% fully vaccinated. vaccines working not? Yes, situation concerning last year vaccine. sure getting downvoted this. understandable packed room would make anxious. Right mask safe additional measure *and* good self care uncomfortable situations. likely true.

But effectively means need test every day (and get results back immediately).

Any testing process 3 day delay likely useless - since that's 3 days person infectious going daily life. time get results back, probably passed infectious period.


That's less accurate quick test widespread deployment much public health benefit. looks like Children's [22 private ICU Given kids go COVID, taking 5 22 (and number could grown weekend) could straining also 'normal' number kids ICU reasons. Super surprising, could've imagined.   ""Where get marvelous shots?"" though, distinction first dose figures second dose important now. single dose much delta infections.

Canada 43% fully vaccinated btw. uncontrolled spread

You missed key word there.  mind blowingly contagious. going get really bad. efficacy rate calculated. Colds surging everyone trying done masks. UK, half US, canada Thanks friend. Yes \*\* nightmare live everyday fear catching thing afraid people u love dying. like 7 covid scares already lol. two years ride. We're lucky alive. game death,a russian roulette. already like **4.000.000/5.000.000M** deaths globally. Thats whole country. Insane...is not? really need special day mourn people died covid. Rest Peace Yll üò¢ 


I know soon nightmare gonna able smile planet. better future üòäüïäÔ∏è  
Go big pharma give us vacineeeesüíâ simply fantastic news Canada. Well done! Difference efficacy large one two doses (couple percent, depending vaccine). think it‚Äôs lack critical thinking. It‚Äôs lack trust experts lack trust institutions.

Those go hand-in-hand me. ""critical"" part ""critical thinking"" using objective analysis form judgment. judgement experts institutions case. objective analysis make things murky times experts institutions make mistakes information limited (like early cloth masks). end easily find numerous quality sources support vaccination follow studies beginning help understand basics virus vaccination mentioned problem.

Without critical thinking using things like religion, politicians might best interests heart, media propaganda make decisions instead. Clearly anti-vax crowd trusts sources cite vaccination bad. never ""I trust anyone"". Interesting point since deaths older folks, presumably already left offspring comparable intelligence. believe Arkansas, 76.72% white, 34.9% fully vaccinated African Americans, make 15.32% population? problems blame minorities without checking numbers first? means 20 vaccinated people leave masks off, that‚Äôs equivalent one unvaccinated person.

This really follow, feels like reaching reasons back opinion, rather letting opinion follow science. got done showing lot data even partial protection masks offer drastically reduce spread disease, due compound nature R-values. treating R-value accounts *completely eliminate* spread disease purely linear decrease, compound effects.

20 vaccinated people much safer 1 unvaccinated person, represent much larger piece population therefore smaller chance virus continuing spread, even one gets it.  Case point. since expectations SOOOO deaths point on.

I seen anything statistically speaking says expect unvaccinated die rate before, even higher. expectation link broken vaccinated only. sort lose throw around ""everybody think deaths over"".  I'm asking *you.* Im indonesia wave started month ago, around 4 percent fully vaccinated. it‚Äôs much easier western media blame chinese vaccines global south trying make have. Part issue timing. People coming due second doses lots mRNA coming little AZ. didn‚Äôt firm schedule AZ shipments. switching people good way make sure didn‚Äôt cancel/reschedule lack available AZ doses. I‚Äôm still sure donated doses actually manufactured ready-to-go. (I hope so, article didn‚Äôt say.) transmission happens seconds passing interaction, become obvious short period time.

You're accounting known high R0 dispersion SARS-CoV-2. ""superspreader"" event fleeting transmission indicative cases, expected given know coronaviruses R0 dispersion.

As another real-life example, SARS1 superspreader Hong Kong infected *hundreds* (yes, hundreds) people high-rise apartment complex, including people adjacent buildings via aerosols. mean SARS 1 high R0, yeah, personally skeptical ICU capacity big effect deaths ship patients cities, send supplies workers cities rural areas. 

I saying argument article was, necessarily believe it.  I‚Äôm making sort argument. I‚Äôm making statement. Deaths hospitalizations continue decline sure talking about? Well done Canada! side seems unhealthy strain *only* focusing negatives underselling/completely ignoring we're much better situation time last year Christmas. People also seem want divert attention away fact vaccines working well! Missouri south thought vaccinated greatly decreased likelihood infected spreading virus though. mean new cases unvaccinated people therefore much suggested decoupling cases deaths? best part Delta even contagious disease like Measles, R0 around 12-18 (about twice bad Delta). stop vaccinations 90%+ range. So, there‚Äôs plenty room get worse! second third scenario occurring would basically mean covid over, condition long covid longer thing effective treatment necessary. interesting thing scenarios don‚Äôt herd immunity vaccines input getting there. We've known beginning almost initial spread China within families/households. Places higher percentage multigenerational households suffered older folks higher risk exposure. USA, included places like crazy outbreaks seen across Navajo nation. 99% deaths COVID-19 unvaxxed people  Dansen met Janssen looooool First all, half got vaccine originally, half placebo. 

Secondly, places cases low, 20k even exposed COVID recently. data would sparse noisy, placebo group later getting vaccinated, can't really easily compared unvaccinated control group. 

Because control blindness trials gone, small sample would good information compared something like country-wide info Israel. Meanwhile, I'm going switch ffp2 ffp3. comes delta variant.  good all, lack Covid-19 awareness cherry shit sundae fan
behaviour (and before, after) final. production delays mean we‚Äôve still never received these; could‚Äôve announced earlier wonder actually waiting get firmer number/date manufacturer committing. Supplies AZ erratic might known exactly much could firmly promise donate‚Ä¶

I hope supply sorted vaccines get people ASAP! makes sense me, too; body's getting bit surprise well reminder. 

Bring side effects, think. means stronger immune response, means fighty bits conquer covid invades. 2nd Moderna Biontech I'll feeling quite lucky. getting ineffective six months since final inoculation?? Beautifully orchestrated.  wearing inside, either could see. proverbial hat pulling numbers?  Yes, is. said wear two masks?

/s       Lax, since wondered.   Rhotterdam incoming.  Euros going month lol Well recipient countries decide want use them. Odds given people 40, still leaves large swaths populations eligible. we're honest, lot problem AZ media smear campaign it; save would seen much wider use Canada. Long Covid! would bottlenecks boosters?

There would difference trying get everybody vaccinated soon possible (so, time, basically), rolling booster need done time. 

EDIT: vaccine switch confer zero immunity, everyone got time originally original bottlenecks.  AZ may better Pfizer Delta variant. Probably superior Cell response (despite lower initial antibody response)

[Canadian data, released last 
Single dose protection symptomatic disease (delta strain): 
Pfizer; 56% 
Moderna; 72% 
AstraZeneca; 67% 
 
Single dose protection hospitalisation death (delta strain): 
Pfizer; 76% 
Moderna; 96% 
AstraZeneca; 88% Absolutely seeing ton RSV kid. Adults coming typical winter stuff I‚Äôm still seeing resurgence Flu Deaths per day cases per day means little isolation (apart extreme cases like billion cases day million deaths day). important look case death ratio. Using rough heuristic deaths lag cases two weeks, compare situation UK late May:

May:

* May 28th: average 8 deaths/day. 
* May 14th: average 2208 cases/day
* Case-to-death ratio: 276:1

June/July

* July 11th: average 29 deaths/day
* June 27th: average 14630 cases/day
* Case-to-death ratio: 504:1

So we're obviously moving right direction. *shocked* see week two we're bit 100 deaths per day, especially June 19th, think temporary get closer 90% adults fully vaccinated. think we're quite close peak here. rounding. VT says 95% 75; 99.9% 70-74 94.6 64-69. Adding probably 95%, rounded 100%.

I tell ME, NH VT messing around. one demographic lagging 18-30, targeting rural counties. immunizations require boosters. don't. example, immunity measles rest life, need boosters things like tetanus pertussis. Fat contagious apparently stupidity is. Eh, I'm used mask already. genuinely bother slightest wear months even year longer. way list things would construe 'shit future'.  cynical part wanted write last sentence ""Protecting freedom worth dying"" refrained. think cynical. may nasty people think like motivated perceive genuine patriotism. perception may misguided, blind, even foolish, wrong assume self-centered malice. Thanks posting regularly. I‚Äôm seeing anecdotes fully vaccinated people reporting they‚Äôre really sick covid I‚Äôm feeling down. think great covid medical care folks still totally free, even decided getting vaccinated Also combining mask 95% effective vaccine, even optimistic estimates efficiency masks, going create combined efficiency couple percentage points higher. Basically looking 1-(1-.95)(p) p probability mask failure. example p = 0.5 .975, 2.5% higher masking. really worth it? confirmed transmission link viral genomic sequencing used CCTV try identify moment transmission. don‚Äôt use CCTV prove genetic relationship strains 2 individuals.

3.	Three migraines month followed (compared one year normally) piece reported many doctors 
4.	Racing heart got high enough visit hospital (and I‚Äôll admit could anxiety stuff above)

All happened 28 days first shot. I‚Äôve several female friends similarly awful stories. Don‚Äôt tell people vaccine effects two days. got fucking slammed. every vaccination sun. I‚Äôm getting poked good civilization thing kicked ass. Something keep mind median American barely graduated high school. I'm saying they're stupid, rather median American background begin critical thinking issues involved pandemic. understand concepts contagion, viruses, infection, scientific method, exponential growth. basic vocabulary, almost impossible ""use objective analysis form judgement"". today, evidence support needing booster scientific approach.

Pfizer suggested evidence Israel supports it. meeting US health officials soon it.

You correct seen evidence supporting it. little strong say certainty evidence exist. possible simply first ones know.

EDIT: also, understanding B cells confer immunity; rather, help fight quickly efficiently get infected. That's still really, really great, technically ""immunity"", right? Ligma get first. cycle threshold PCR testing mostly irrelevant. Essentially run test various thresholds results decide someone infectious not. whole PCR threshold debacle anti-vax covid denier misinformation. love link 1992 video PCR test inventor claiming threshold levels. tests evolved since 30 year old video test thresholds accuracy, picked 1. cousin South Jersey checking regularly family lockdown started.

Viruses constant series new variants original covid likely disappeared year ago. We're vaccinated I'd like worth remembering we've fully vaccinated 51% population Netherlands 39% Pfizer approved 12 older. Canada government recommending got astrazeneca vaccine get mRNA vaccine second dose

I believe provinces also even allowing astrazeneca shots first dose anymore associated deaths bloodclots 

Donating surplus astrazeneca vaccines good move still rubs wrong way Canadian government essentially saying vaccines good enough Canadians, fine low income people people going panic panicking again. predominantly affect rural America due less hospital capacity lower vaccination rates. easy believe invisible God sky endeavored provide proof existence mandates, yet hard believe scientists prove degrees evidence value safety vaccinations. Weird. 

Nothing religion - faith. faith scientists give tons evidence. I'm sure well works. 

The trial compare vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. randomly assigned blinded. since then, placebo group given vaccine wanted it? group comparison really there. 

So compare general population, sorts problems vaccinations randomly assigned blinded, results skewed by, say, whether vaccinated people different ages unvaccinated people feel safe enough higher-risk things. Moreover, case numbers low since mass-vaccinations started, would harder see clear trends. 

So relatively-small numbers trial participants might give us clear data there's good control group, introduce ton noise data. noisy data, would need much larger groups, like data coming Israel. I'll honest you, followed story. wanted leave cheeky comment. meant taken seriously. Well, 2008 2018 one died covid19 one vaccinated yet. hardly see kids around masks anymore. I‚Äôm Georgia. Maybe less 10% kids mask see stores public. kids definitely small minority still mask. scared school start less month see out.  Maybe virus control. still mutating. government cancel concerts?

Health insurances exempt liability. CDC wrong almost everything least months behind comes latest Covid info. Forbes echoes CDC WHO. 

I don‚Äôt read Fox news, please show fox news article would support claim.

I follow Hopkins doctors consult infectious disease experts around country proven track record accurate comes Covid data, ones rely solely CDC delta variant mainly circulating younger populations. delta variant fraction deadly original strains Covid circulating back February-June 2020. Combine two facts point mentioned tweet it‚Äôs really huge jump understand claimed also accurate. family members live said, lot real backwaters full holy rolling types seen shit roll congregations early people told quarantine ‚Äòtrying kill religion‚Äô doubled vaccine ‚Äòbeing lie do‚Ä¶..something‚Äô. 

My family tend avoid lot people like plague simply because‚Ä¶‚Ä¶well, wouldn‚Äôt you?  people seem bound determined wipe face earth somehow.

It‚Äôs damn disheartening.  think it‚Äôs pretty clear said. I‚Äôll restate since seem missed point. Selfish people still feel like getting vaccine themselves. avoid subsequent shots, potential lockdowns, strain may impact health wise. 

As already happened swine flu Hong Kong flu?

Curious connection here, would suffice answer. Hong Kong flu, COVID?
If wouldn‚Äôt know why, lol. People different. I‚Äôm pointing shift perspective implying need vaccinated well?

This weird follow up. didn‚Äôt mention swine flu. Please elaborate. Don‚Äôt really care normal symptoms getting vaccine whatever it‚Äôs worse version vaccines demographic there‚Äôs chance myocarditis basically danger getting covid. (Through fault own) got bad young person health issues, notably breathing issues months, don‚Äôt want come ignorant dangers disease, fear dangers vaccine. Hope makes sense. No, know they‚Äôre going that. traditional booster, tools already available. It‚Äôs delayed third shot. 

A reconfigured booster targeting Delta variants also feasible although runs unlikely health risks standpoint using know safe, unmodified third shot makes sense. Delta platform mutation would effective boost however. early say whether bypass fully vaccinated. Maybe starts surge among unvaccinated spreads there. Lots examples breakthrough cases. Let‚Äôs wait see So....we still know? Got it. Great article, I'm gonna assume *maybe* time next year. See 2022. I've lurking here's personal opinion this. EUA, threshold EUA approval suuuuuper low. essentially prove may work also causing major problems long met study goal win, hence remdesivir.

Absolute risk reduction Pfizer Moderna vaccines 0.7% 1.1% respectively. abysmally low risk reduction top that, based information CDC past months, 78% hospitalizations covid obese larger patients, 79% deaths 65+. 0-49 group represents 4.7% deaths 28,263 deaths 596,740.

65+ group represents 79% deaths 473,864 596,740.

75+ group represents 57% 340,853 originally based insane virus idea about, hospitals overwhelmed, treatments standards care. insane fear mongering started early on, anyone everyone regardless risk factors, risk death case making people suspicious hesitant.

The fact government everyone else truly honest really hurting cause. ""The science says"" ""trust science"" become universal chant people know science longer shows anyone everyone risk death yet continue make sound like literal life death situation everyone.

""Your child could die get vaccine.""

Deaths 0-17 range account 0.05% deaths. Shoot deaths 0-29 age range account 0.49% deaths. statistically likely child die unintentional accident teenager dying whole texting driving covid.

This also starting look like going influenza style virus even getting vaccine prevent getting covid, spreading covid, becoming sick covid. goes back established science influenza suggest getting flu vaccine old fall risk category.

Add misc things like fact covid disease burden keeping track cumulatively instead yearly seasonally, fact literally enough time evaluate long term potential problems vaccine, fact turned big brother ordeal lost audience.

One first things learned 10 year healthcare career cannot bully people making lifestyle health changes choices. need present information non-biased non-threatening way allow make choice ABSOLUTELY done slightest. Yea , like voting demographics, panhandle northern Florida doesn‚Äôt make compared major cities Orlando , Tampa , Miami. not. Delta specific bolster discussed, 3rd dose. oh, doctors saying take vaccine, president says anyways, would justified taking it? think still fence vaccine.. course downright refuse believe make majority.  also produce many variants also threatened rest us, would this. Yup. hysteria needs end Time cia backed coup Haha that‚Äôs figured. definitely evidence favor ivermectin helping outcomes idea could ever replace vaccines absurd.   vaccine 100% effective individual level would decline find new job someone's slave. Political speech first amendment make proposing near impossible. Even push it, isn't. stick gubernment get shot, mofos. going every red part country month two. Back school, masks, everything open, pitiful vaccination rate. problem even tide starts turn people get vaccinated, takes 14 days protection, 35 days full protection. gonna late anything there. renewed calls mask mandates closures (much less vaccines) fought tooth nail power party sabotage economic recovery. 

Saving grace full FDA approval given employers start requiring vaccine combat ridiculous care costs. Even then, states outright banned essentially choose suffer instead requirements emergency release benefits must outweigh risks. could 51% benefit 49% risk ratio would still get passed. doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs actual percentage, saying that‚Äôs works. ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù received 100% FDA approval. 33% effective Delta. brilliant.

Even prior 50%, really useful population level. It‚Äôs coin toss. Oh no. tragedy. could‚Äôve foreseen this. 

And yet.. anti-vaxxing continues. That‚Äôs become case lot places, I‚Äôve fully vaccinated AZ 24 years old. 12 weeks apart, Melbourne. Oh no. tragedy. could‚Äôve foreseen this. 

And yet.. anti-vaxxing continues. Yes.

And optimally, government need tell people wear mask ""or else"". People would do.

People that. Apparently, someone needs whip stick reads ""or else!"".

So government states ""just whatever think right"". Well, gee-golly, thanks! Agreed. sounds like nobody needs booster yet, fact made current vaccine quickly demonstrates skills make boosters needed. Massachusetts long ago

I mean sure want consider 300+ years ago short time ago. may well consider apples Oranges different eras are. 10% legroom  We‚Äôve mess everything last year half. god we‚Äôve got branding down. government hoping could sort sucker 90 percent population getting vaccinated. isn‚Äôt happening,‚Äù panelist said cheers.

The goal actually 70% dumbass panelist. guess right-wingers gonna misinform heart out. Ugh, that's awful. may matter 'both correct' - 5 kids hospital COVID, ICU full normally need tons ICU beds non-infant children.

But yes, news stories this. (US)have gone average well 10,000 30,000 cases day 4 weeks. least 7 states covid control two hospitals can't take anymore cases shipping states. deaths gone double digits 300 500 range. short period time.  UK vaccinated 51.8% twice (or J&amp;J). rest fully protected case, seems AZ issues Delta. specifically, long incubation time means selective pressure toward less deadly variant, since contagiousness seems somewhat similar early stages infection someone ever get mild symptoms, any, someone wind severe disease.  Well shit, goes pick line. point wish health care industry would start denying Covid coverage anti vax people. Basically get Covid deny claims related COVID-19 didn‚Äôt get vaccine  UK cases surging well Euros even started, they're already ahead numbers December went hard lockdown. covid explosion Netherlands instance also fit nicely euro schedule, fit perfectly decision open everything easy circumvent rules.

I think complete agreement public Euros. completely insane. one many stupid decisions made, leading force increase. That's definitely Delta mutation, also scientific consensus way. Remember Europe basically completely open last summer covid record low numbers. old variant could lot season without major spread increases. honestly wouldn‚Äôt worried . I‚Äôm Louisiana kid‚Äôs back school since August 2020, issues. daily summer camp (day care) last summer summer. 2nd grade private K-7 school, almost mask use except maybe first couple months last school year. difference teachers vaccinated want to. nervous hell first went back last year, we‚Äôve zero issues.  Twice year received letter kid class testing positive, never spread anyone school. lives nursing home. spend days unmasked floor (because lives). she‚Äôs covid positive, could potentially infect anyone around isn‚Äôt vaccinated, isn‚Äôt fully protected vaccine (like old/sick immuno compromised people may be).

You today's giver new knowledge. Thx. think may thing saves us. No, can‚Äôt forced get vaccine, vaccinated people get access concerts, sporting events, certain jobs, travel. mean, travel thing going reality - certain countries already allowing fully vaccinated people visit.  

I love cruise lines gotten around Florida governor‚Äôs edict allow businesses require vaccination.  One cruise line decided sure, unvaccinated passengers free cruise 5% capacity unvaccinated passengers. However, passengers voluntarily show proof vaccination wear masks public areas, access restaurants shows. Unvaccinated? Well, you‚Äôre wearing mask whole trip, allowed certain dining entertainment venues. 

Personally, would want work beside unvaccinated person unless wearing mask. Health safety work count something. love reddit. Learn something every day.

Looking current stats, 50% AZ ideal Delta. anti vax issue, supply issue. simply doses available distribute. Korea really well back 2020 double digit cases per day, government hesitant make contracts vaccines wanted wait see happens countries waiting better price. many predicted, turned horrible decision. holding daughter back year starting kindergarten hopes MAYBE vaxxed protected idiots here. see interview hospital head Missouri? 80% covid patients vents. one point 88%.

I really hope one day everyone looks back shit handled thinks ""Fuck stupid"".

And fully understand lot people already think I'm hoping one day people get it, US zero restrictions zero masks nearly 3 months now. Stadiums full, hospitals major cities overwhelmed hospitalization/death rates seem rising. rural areas southwest MO hospitals reaching capacity hours nearest MLB stadium likely result packed events.

The UK, much higher vaccination rate allows fans sporting event problem?

It seems UK taking similar approach US - everyone wants vaccine get vaccine, long hospitals manage deaths going need restrictions.

If time start opening learning live damn virus, is? going away, ever. Unfortunately best time plant tree 20 years ago, second best time now. realize even vaccine still catching it

No. complete science denying bullshit. damage lungs,brain heart right?

If I'm unlucky enough actually get infected vaccinated even unlucky get severe case, small chance damage, yes. We're going far beyond lesson Spanish Flu here... We're talking exceptions exceptions vaccine prevents symptoms zero clue help long term damage still letting mutate shall see happens.

The vaccine largely prevents infection, symptoms, spread. alone help whole lot potential long term damage. again, far, far beyond lesson Spanish Flu. sure downvotes? Learning generally good thing! enough people get vaccinated. sent email wife (works long-term care /rehabilitation children Little Rock). They're severely understaffed right ICU full. idea news story it, kind pisses off. It‚Äôs useless all. Asymptomatic cases develop long COVID issues, especially nursing home setting, people‚Äôs health already closely monitored, it‚Äôs good know intervention mat necessary. sub weird. get downvoted stating facts (with linked sources) obvious uncontroversial implications. 

People want believe everything alright dared contradict narrative ‚Äúonly third eligible people fully vaccinated‚Äù

This far alarming‚Ä¶ Canada super duper free health care system 42% fully vaccinated, bit higher worst state. long guarantee aren‚Äôt mutation factories Exactly! year ago people kept saying viruses tend ""mutate they're milder"" I've saying wrong! Viruses (and everything else) mutate stay alive. care mild severe illness cause. Even kills lot people, long spread infect enough people kills host, matter.

I concerned mask-wearing would encourage evolution strain transmitted easily, despite wearing masks. Wearing masks reduced transmission, allows ""tittest"" viral mutations become airborne. similar antibiotics finish treatment kill all, ones remaining likely todevelop antibiotic-resistantance. pro-mask, tool (unfortunately) makes sense stop virus reducing actual human-to-human contact. 

The reason viruses actually appear become ""milder"" gone population once, pretty much everyone exposed either died level immunity. virus mutates, may get re-infected, cases milder. comes around third time, milder still. **immune system** makes viruses appear get milder time, evolution virus. Vaccines get us fewer casualties. lived Southern California opened trunk see big brown widow, hourglass facing me, hanging out. go ask neighbor help never seen brown one. didn‚Äôt know existed day. understand it, Vanilla Covid still mostly pockets. Delta much contagious can't compete long. mean brown recluse? Viruses want kill host. prevents transmitting further. time evolve prioritize transmission reduce death rates. Interesting. might they've utterly failed communicate that. I've read dozen articles monoclonals elderly (including latimes article) none available everyone.   Username checks out. They'll give cash ask - least Amex Giftcards functionally thing (at least US; Amex bit harder use overseas). 

Some limited overbooking flights economically optimal parties involved. better airline better passengers. voluntary (and Delta *very* good making voluntary - one flight offering $4,000 someone finally took), means optimal preference matching. Everyone made better off: people paid expensive last minute tickets really needed flight, people agreed get bumped nominal dollar amount made decision valued flight hundreds (or thousands, rare case) dollars received exchange taking later one. depends person. me, pretty much over. im vaccinated, friends family, aside handful small kids, vaccinated too. Im back usual routine.

i watch news case something happens, that, things mostly way before. Monthly subscription. right shoot gun indiscriminately crowd, idea whether gun loaded not.

COVID19 often asymptomatic. idea passing fatal illness random stranger, unless (a) properly masked, (b) vaccinated 10K positive cases total 3 hospitalizations, 2 IC admittances, 0 deaths.... too. again, known better. know dumbass asshole refusing wear mask start, claimed diet would protect her, barely survived covid hospital stay double pneumonia, whole family got sick released hospital announced still get vaccine. 74 years old Herbalife cultist. health officials

Who says health officials made final call? example, quite want delay Freedom Day, Boris Johnson refuses.     Sounds familiar. know best part is? Everyone office right fuck talking seen year. MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY! add...  Spanish flu mostly forgotten fueled it: ww1. war completely overshadowed pandemic. never even heard spanish flu covid. seems wrong  Translates ""we're making shit go along"" one forced anything YET. seems growing amount Americans think covid vaccination forced. saying majority though they'll kill people dumb too.

Total injustice mother nature read one interviews scramble. beg borrow steal (ok, steal) hospital systems. problem enough staff. vents, beds, understaffed. 

It's like worst 2020 again. Yes, remark related UK, Netherlands. UK almost 70% fully vaccinated.  What's scary look ""log graph,"" rate changes. Cases climbing, look fast they're climbing.... yikes. can't fix ignorant. sad, lot people extremely vaccine hesitant getting medical information Fox, OANN, Facebook. Many get sick probably die. also governor extremely hostile mask wearing. Heaven help kids go back school Fall. 

It's incredibly sad.   Funny, that. realize even vaccine still catching damage lungs,brain heart right? vaccine prevents symptoms zero clue help long term damage still letting mutate shall see happens. Also won‚Äòt help employer breaks law says ""**** you, paying you"".

No employer would Switzerland. pay full salary sick. employer gets reimbursed wage insurance, incentive try cheat wage risk legal troubles. still Olympics? Big overlap climate ""skeptics"" also.  Get vaccine get virus. im taking care myself. respect opinion would implications forced vaccinations? Maybe *is* something water.... Link? [They 5 Covid patients Best wishes, friend. I'm frustrated upset you. know right thing when/if mask mandates back (it's Chicago, right?) clear. Thank taking pandemic seriously understanding FAR long vaccines disregarded. contacted they're going reinforce rules customers (including them). feel better now. Nonetheless guess I'll wait 5 days see symptons antigen test, case.

I feel cheated. almost 2 years I've religiously careful this, family, less 24H 1st shot 1st tour while, get idiot lowers mask car talk ""he's vaccinated he's safe"". could ruin everything :( Well even government encourages it, people aren‚Äôt really it. isn‚Äôt. Kids don‚Äôt spread COVID. US rates free fall outside anti ax pockets. consists stupid adults. haha yeah hate shit. keep rolling eyes meetings say shit like that. yeah cuz thats told colonizers. Maybe listening science countries. Like Israel. lesson Spanish Flu tells keep acting like immunity countries widespread vaccine availability. learn lessons actually lock downs radically altered society year vaccines. absence increased hospitalizations deaths good news. means (1000 per day currently Arkansas) people getting natural immunity without vaccination made decision get. 
It's important happens summer, people able cope infections summer due higher humidity exposure sunlight. definitely good news infections dampen increase hospitalizations deaths happens winter every year. Makes u wonder someone wants humanity dead guess not. Mean green here. getting worse ICU nurse covid unit seen things? Iv disability since April Yep. like hate opinion, anything opposes believe threatens makes feel scared. human nature. believe do, *must* evil. People believe right. need educated misinformation there. 

I've heard single person say ""Oh vaccine works. safe. want get it."" even worse ""I'm hoping get COVID take many people possible muahahahahahahahahhaha.""

Taking approach change anyone's mind. Still waiting someone explain why, despite 30 minutes Canada, see Confederate flag often

It's even weirder seeing Canadians driving around Yep. like hate opinion, anything opposes believe threatens makes feel scared. human nature. believe do, *must* evil. People believe right. need educated misinformation there. 

I've heard single person say ""Oh vaccine works. safe. want get it."" even worse ""I'm hoping get COVID take many people possible muahahahahahahahahhaha.""

Air conditioning jets wouldn‚Äôt made last longer. anything would burned faster faster spread early months. F Yea keeping track current scientific info may pertinent later isn‚Äôt fear, it‚Äôs common sense. Delta put us another weeks long lockdown, wasn‚Äôt media fear it, careless non-quarantining twits. Disturbingly enough covid good business. Strong retort, bud. would surprising? covid still around.... think outside, enjoying outside things couldnt last year, everyone spread out...and ""vaccine"". everyone EVERYONE guard down. waiting there, ready pounce. fall coming! already mid july. ;) wait it. dont say didnt warn comes back like HELL *lets 20,000 people soccer arena*

*cases rise like hell*

HoW hApPeNs :o!! got lol link supplied go suggesting does.

Breakthrough infections happen Covid Vaccines. MRNA ones slightly better efficacy infection (including AZ) provide good protection severe illness death.

Again.....I'm asking getting information accurate. true - deaths still increase vaccines made far less previous waves. Look UK example. last time many cases per day, deaths order magnitude higher. Yes, plenty things going around. Wtf talking about? East coast also much dense actual public transportation heavily relied  Lol well good news brown widows chill unless disturbed.

Gotta make sure keep middle management leaches employed. Sinovac study complete yet. interim results. look promising though.

And know referring regarding moving goal posts. I've stated facts based scientific studies. personally invested Sinovac well, bias. UK got 6-month head start Europe.

[It's like 6 (+/- weeks depending whether look first doses, second doses, total number doses administered). study used Marines Lancet might want look at. following quote Lancet readable rewrite source official sub study, conducted May November 2020, revealed around 10 percent (19 189) participants previously infected SARS-CoV-s (seropositive) became reinfected, compared new infections 50 percent (1.079 2,247) participants previously infected (seronegative). 

Personally I'm watching data Israel UK see current low-reoccurrence continues trend changes. No, needs point say enough. point, saying people important others, cannot continue fashion. Germany high rate vaccination, never ICU beds risk, deaths mostly elderly.

Tell dentist feel safe. wonder UK first major country truly puts pandemic behind it. vaccination, prior infection current case rates high, hard imagine many people virus infect. know, said ""most Europe recommends health care workers get flu shots"", incorrect. statement makes seem like anti vaccine sentiment promoted government, isn't. 5G antenna included! giving AZ booster shot. oh scary since country started dropping rules like netherlands June 26th required testing practically thing here.

Nothing posted links somehow back ""everybody thinks deaths over"". anything constant messaging CDC, NIH, president, get vaccinated get sh*t pushed in.

Talking vague terms pointless. Lets talk numbers. Last heard subject Scott Gottlieb suggested models show fall/winter peak 20% last year's peak terms cases. early Delta story, know models might shifted since. means deaths know, surely still means substantially less last fall. Well I'm double vaccinated expect spend 2 weeks mandatory hotel quarantining emigrate Australia shortly. However, theres number outbreaks said hotels there's talk fully vaccinated people negative either less quarantine. reasoning seems negative, vaccinated person less likely false negative get infected transit would draining quarantine systems would allow better infection control quarantine hotels. 

I surprised 5 day quarantine repeat swab instead full 2 weeks. Relax. sub full vaccination extremists. right, fully prevent spreading. reduces risk so, enough allow travelling without testing.

But yeah, cramp. People say vaccine save us best vaccine ever bad extremist anti-vaxxers.

Sure noble cause handle none less. Last year similar articles nasal vaccines, Ivermectin, testing via breathing dogs detecting covid.

Additionally, want take chance allowing variants spread mutate further.

Doesn't matter whether Missouri even mask mandate anymore. **Behave one.** *need* one, bizarre Red Team allegiance makes chances one actually happening soon rather unlikely.

Doesn't matter whether vaccinated yourself. **Wear one anyway.** risk breakthrough infections makes risk worth it.

It's always black white right? Also, jumping opportunity label someone definitely part subject becomes polarizing people get upset. illegal work hospital care homes unvaccinated flu included think that's true. Governments sort data.

really, wearing mask 20 minutes inside grocery store inconvenience everyone makes seem be. also I've seen lot people saying ""well mask offers % points protection"" oh interesting, why'd wear one first place then? big rule follower? also strictly follow speed limit even empty road? seems extremely nitpicky. Obviously rather 20 vaccinated people 1 unvaccinated person, obviously larger segment population. ""equivalent"" sense that, person 5% chance catching compared unvaccinated person, probability 1 case either group.  

In bringing R values think fallaciously assuming 20 vaccinated people exhaust population. think along lines, virus also *completely eliminated* population 1 - catch goes away. instead assume groups part wider population unvaccinated, becomes clear talk virus disappearing nonsense.  

She also got done taking issue people say ""isn't following science"" ignores real adjacent moral issues. may right criticism - I'm layman probably understand comment. incredibly condescending attitude towards Oxford professor precisely reason England problem ""following experts"". disagree analysis without questioning integrity like that. actually wondering travelers faked first tests somehow.

.I agree u/crazyeddit929.

I infected group people 2020 year example story happened. everyone infected singing songs idiots even masked. original variant infectious would way devastating every single person around infected person would end infected know sure happen every single time.  think overestimate power health officials certain situations, certain administrations. data one even seen yet, beyond company, data highly skeptical. Depends live. I'm Ontario, 30 got second dose July 4 (originally scheduled early end September). essential worker, high risk anything putting advanced category. Every single person friend family group double-vaccinated yesterday. lot immunocompomised people US 0.01%. I‚Äôve seen estimates 10 million even 6% population. mean, I'd personally still prefer avoid months brain fog shortness breath, guess mileage may vary.   Well biggest control know got them. general public it‚Äôs harder tell. example pop J&amp;J local event weekend you‚Äôd never know someone got someone got one one 3 months ago unless got sick reported. least check participated. symptoms partner last week. thinking getting tested - tell long symptoms get PCR test? 618 cases 677,000 inoculated healthcare workers. 0.09%. data referenced article led author choosing headline says hundreds vaccinated Sinovac getting sick. surprising?  really story that, positive tests performed three days negative tests, partying close quarters.

delta also seems develop infectiousness symptoms earlier variants. another example tells go traveling anywhere another year two. 

Like everything world, pandemic based well trust human nature .... means never trust human nature. 

All takes ignorant idiots we're danger. Norway steady number infections last weeks prevalence delta variance increasing. tells us reproduction number quite steady around 1. 56% total population vaccinated first dose, 29% fully vaccinated. 

When done fully vaccinating adult population end around 75% total population vaccinated. means 20 percentage points increase today. I've seen estimates first dose efficacy 4 40%. Since virtually infections happening unvaccinated groups 4 percentage point reduction enough bring R 1, virus die out. lowest possible estimate efficacy. even get infected vaccinated, less likely spread others.

In 5 weeks done first dose weeks see effects. curious fare compared Israel. One big advantage people denying vaccine, religious communities, directly comparable. also likely much higher rate vaccinations. 

If understanding correct herd immunity rather sudden, rather gradual thing. pass infectins drop fast. One disadvantage virus, less immunity infections. good prepared, like condom, Id rather it, need it, need it. they're allowed people allowed sue vaccine manufactures severe adverse effects English. front page media written French, Italian, Spanish (etc.) probably ever see it. automatically assume dangerous, though certainly could be. chance dangerous, though, case involving one variant. Everyone asshole here...both gov't people blame. government easing quickly assuming people would discipline abide guidelines 2) people stupid whole thing. Screencappin negative test QR code able go out? WTF! kind sounds like you‚Äôre looking reason avoid getting vaccine (judging comments, anyway), I‚Äôd suggest getting two doses (by WIDE margin) greater assurance clean bill health waiting get infected COVID. 

Especially we‚Äôre talking Delta, people still much better getting vax. protection still better protection, dunno even question gut level feel way people compromised immune systems Chemo, HIV drugs etc also pay price.

I truly angry work tiptoe around anti vaxers feelings. absolutely passport people vaccinated live lives close normal possible chose live like 2020 forever. Israeli Pfizer info questionable with, nothing them! released info trail/study did, beyond went 67% terms symptomatic, still highly effective keeping severe. Frim ive read, israel study maybe outlier compared canada, UK. looks like NJ NYC impacted Delta Variant considering states heavily vaccinated. fluctuation, none kind explosive growth we're seeing Arkansas. Mississippi Alabama. states trouble. Texas Florida. NorthEast ones. Upvote user name. Actually everyone display proof either vaccination negative test. hard cheat system you‚Äôre talking ass. Locking thread might interpreted ""vaccines work"". know vaccines matter.  Ignore them, clearly troll they're banned. Tell public health people who'll push one regardless, agree never happen again. got splainin' Spain Critical thinking thing possess. all. user long time wonderful contributor. believe moment FDA working fast possible.

While ""studying"" emergency approval Pfizer, insider revealed reviewers took 4 days Thanksgiving holiday. idea ""fast possible"" different mine. Sounds like ""business usual"" consequences damned. No, young people get hospitalised die. alpha variant became dominant country saw increase younger people hospitalised. delta variant became dominant UK people 20s 30s started hospitalised bigger numbers wasn‚Äôt one downvoted. provided evidence wanted know proposed solution want moment since don‚Äôt approved booster yet. Short sneaking another shot isn‚Äôt much one rolled out.  vaccines effective *at least* six months. That‚Äôs last set numbers available clinical trials. One year data coming relatively soon. can‚Äôt tell lasts five years nobody five years, right? it‚Äôs probably permanent. don‚Äôt official data yet. 

Nothing ever 100% effective 100% people. chances catching passing virus vaccination *significantly* lower. Possibly. Things change week week pandemic. delta variant isn‚Äôt going end thing knows next variation countered effectively vaccine. means live life, international travel huge festival give anyone pause right now. Even health wise you‚Äôd fine, things might closed restricted capacity. yearly flu shot 30-50% effective. 

Given nature covid, want much higher efficacy. depends crowded place is. respiratory droplets, coughs, sneezes contribute virus transmission. Yes, reasons outlines tweets 75-6, point nothing undermine. still reduces chances infection, much experience USSR EU relevant China Taiwan situation?

Do live country everything made Russia suddenly comes vaccine no? (And vaccine even made China case). difficult? regular flu shot 30-50% effective yearly dosing. 

Doing one extra time worthwhile tradeoff close 90% efficacy Probably venting post ease nerves guess.

I'm middle relocating departing flight Friday. Due COVID destination stringent pre-departure testing requirements (PCR + spike protein IgM, plus nucleocapsid protein IgM vaccinated people w/ positive spike protein IgM), really getting nerves moment.

Rationally know I'm likely fine - I've fully vaccinated w/ Moderna two months; kept mask indoors crowded outdoor areas; live area cases low (2-3 cases/day whole county while) vaccination rates decent (68.2% 1st dose, 64.3% fully vaccinated 16+ population). 

However, still can't stop thinking worst case scenario got positive spike protein antibody whatever reason, got positive N protein exposure aware of, miss flight altogether. would really screw since I'm expiring visa.

Sorry rant. feels there's lot stake generally overwhelming. Also apologies unfit thread. slowly much lower rates previous waves? almost vaccinating vulnerable populations decreases number hospitalizations per covid infection. _shocking_  relying honor system. People lie, that's proven world. Whatever ""proof"" is, it'll faked. Already happened states. stay home country quit adding problem. NL, get away things like these, wife says ""[hij was]
een beetje dom"" ;) feel bad kids going get it. Hopefully blame regressive parents government. Hope darwinism works fast, can't desantis Trump office 2024 expect free country much longer. Still lolling? Excellent year ago people kept saying viruses tend ""mutate they're milder"" I've saying wrong! Viruses (and everything else) mutate stay alive.

Indeed, there's necessarily selective pressure given virus less harmful.

It may illustrate overall point selective pressure think mutations something happen *to viruses*‚Äîmutations merely random errors replication. 

If happens mutation gives resulting replicated viruses advantage strains, mutation become common. agree good options choose from. absence long term historical data virus consider prudent cautious. think wise strongly push public message consciously choosing wear mask spaces people sharing air default, situations like night clubs gyms exceptions. 

Time time througout pandemic enough general public shown scant regard social distancing principles, mask wearing isolating ill drive infections. find depressing hear people declare personal rights important basic civic responsibility welfare everyone (including them, families loved ones). Nobody's saying anything shit 16 months dropping restrictions paying lipservice ""personal responsibility"" going work. moment night clubs open UK they're going rammed full young yet double vaccinated people explosion infection rates. remains seen whether turn spawn new variant contribute higher hospitalisations deaths. Denmark might effective country Europe terms managing pandemic. 

Didn't take ridiculously authoritarian policies either. high levels social trust sensible government programs. That‚Äôs certainly interesting. also curious one sinovac followed mRNA. Yeah basically feels like cold far. non-issue. 
 
I remind lived USSR EU, thus immune propaganda. 
 later even supporters want vaccines whatever source, still refuse make move. revealed high rank people stakes locally developed vaccines. profiting blocking imported vaccines. 
 
Corruption certainly possible. try avoid one trusted alternatives. Positive cases sent home bus. ones got plane tickets bought parents :x don‚Äôt lie, don‚Äôt lie, don‚Äôt lie. . . . . . Well certainly used ammo. Hard say effect numbers end. makes sense people cross border. Thousands people crossed border every day even ""shut down"".

Borders arbitrary unless stop travel quarantine everyone comes little effect. Taiwan shut travel test everyone comes in. Countries like germany never that.

You dont even notice cross borders europe time. Dude, reports old? Well one Netherlands Scandinavia. outdoor masks thing loads countries - UK, Germany, Ireland. agree, make covid-proof. people vaccinated, point allowing 2 dose vaccinated travelers exempt quarintine. happens, took risk risk means possible outcome.  Meanwhile fully vaccinated UK friend mine can't come visit US, got Astrazeneca vaccine. AwardShareReport

I'm American, thank god. Also, AC units everywhere here.  think he‚Äôs got it! George he‚Äôs got it!! stop American resistors, government give another stimulus adult citizens (I'm hearing $2,000) provide proof fully vaccinated. may pull anti vaxxers long run, help stop pandemic. (And use money) know - good terrible! Oh brain wants! nothing like biggest festival world kick thing high gear  crucial distinction. 

Firstly, partial vaccination shows big drop efficacy Delta. 

Secondly, people age 25 eligible second vaccine September. Coincidentally, group also group new cases highest.

When comes actual % population, 60% fully vaccinated nation. That's good enough cause delta die here. they'll say pressured/bribed approving them. know they‚Äôre collecting data. J&amp;J test participants posed they‚Äôre tracked Covid vaccinated subreddit. Moderna one haven‚Äôt heard much on. think getting people third doses gonna logistical issue, since 2 already proving problematic. agree flare-ups likely remain issue. Got keep vaccination numbers high! 2 dose Pfizer, probabilty catching covid around 33% (from latest Israil study). overcome covid easily, still able spread virus. Assume population 1 million people, 333k people able catch spread virus bubble.

&amp;#x200B;

I think living rock. Vaccines prevent hospitilization slow spread. vaccinated person covid-proof.  Jesus, watching people video talk experience eye-rolling. America. imagine pre-covid conversations like. Didn‚Äôt Vax passports fail Netherlands? understand management this. Sending positive cases planes home quarantine family seems like cluster. Definitely COVID camp testing vaccination pass system seems much organised respected though. Like Missouri? Glad hear company backing up! I'd shocked anything changed general population time soon. Frontline healthcare workers immune compromised people? Sure, even Israel, Pfizer citing study from, approved boosters immune compromised people since vaccines still protect severe symptoms high level. time, come back talk around September. wonder handled July 4 reporting then?

Increasing 47% 136,351 implies went 93k 136k. 

World Meters going 105k 120k time period.  
New York Times going 93k 133k 
CDC show data recent two days, starting point 97k 

I guess WorldOfMeters odd one out. sources reporting 40%+ growth not. Reposted Reddit didn‚Äôt like link. messaging gets little dicey. lot weird reports Israel re: Delta lot base rate fallacy bias.

Breakthrough cases noted supervised, yes. context what‚Äôs going important going forward. Breakthrough cases still absurd rare. hospital specifically, could count number hands. Breakthrough cases IMO going highly significant larger percentage population get hospitalized severe disease. Mainly tools vaccines playing meant severely reduce severity novelty covid. Cases what‚Äôs going happen, pandemic prolonged many hospital it. Owning first, dying later. One step time. joke dude. China one powerful nations earth. need protection... banter, guess understand that. happens towards nations china sudden taken super serious (at least you). relax dude, need get panties twist... r/coronavirusuk , pretty much wait 4 weeks Well work field know. glib saying ct threshold doesn‚Äôt matter... does... own. explained me.


‚ÄúPCR amplification s-shaped curve. There's lead-up phase fluorescence assay limit detection instrument, get flat line. There's exponential section amplifying target....exponentially final section hits ceiling due consumption reagent/degradation enzyme. run PCR enough cycles, hit final section. way seeing curves 1992, Mullis making comments. guesswork. Sometimes stop PCR cycle 20 hope stopped middle exponential cycle could run gel see different band intensities. ran 45 cycles PCR ran gel always see dark band. guesswork. Real-time PCR changed things allowing us see exactly target (if any) amplified. notice image linked, curves hit maximum? That's point. run qPCR curves saturated. measure Ct difference samples (called ddCt method). qPCR doubles per cycle, e.g. ddCT 2 means there's 4-fold difference abundance nucleotide. test works like measuring there's amplification using covid primers, measuring there's amplification. Based comparison amplification occurs, make scientific assessment whether there's viral RNA sample not. ‚Äú Missouri beautiful state Ozarks Mark Twain NF, people‚Ä¶ ugh.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Now, let's go blind taste test. Uh-oh. look happy. He's using Brand Xxxxxxxssss! Ate saying confirmed sequencing? far seen nothing indicating that. I'm expert, think booster idea wanting extra protection new variants, immunity first doses wearing off. 100% sure, seems like new surges vaccinated countries caused variants. Spain: problem more. see, seems understand common practice Pharmaceutical, international business proxies.

Any company buy exclusive distribution right greater China region. example, Pfizer bought it, Taiwan wants buy bioNTech vaccines, deal Pfizer. There's politics involved. Chinese government could care less owns right region, state owned vaccines.

I see parallel comparison private owned, exchange listed company private military navy. right respected, that's rule business world. Otherwise, one gonna make investments. always been. hope always traveler's case caught rest family becomes infectious. Well, yeah. Personally wish we'd stayed lockdown extra month last year.  misleading (intentionally misleading, accuse) journalism. previous Sunday July 4, holiday. happens EVERY. SINGLE. HOLIDAY. week out, media reports much worse things gotten single week. US cases started going up. already going last week, holiday reporting lag depressed increase, catch up. like clockwork, dishonest media outlets use sensationalism farm clicks. continue mask isolate himself, world need cater lowest denominator? Like really trying asshole here, think 99.9% population safely receive vaccine (wether decide take different number) need stop world .01% can‚Äôt? Hope better immune system did. Hes one trust Where's sarcasm sign? go guys.

You blood clotty stuff. lack crtical thinking, education trust. Go USA :( Yes, need people vaccinated make difference. I've 0 experience French fans'. Usually Russians English, experience, least. Yes, still protect hospitalization death. protection symptomatic infection declining however, could end causing problems terms things like labor force disruptions lots people developing long COCAINE Restricting danish/german border never made sense. 
 
Border crossing restrictions always makes sense. borders for. state exists borders. 
 best youre delaying inevitable weeks. 
 
Taiwan New Zealand successful years. 
And Middle Ages border quarantines successfully run decades.  one thing that's worth pointing that's simple ""anyone wants one get one"" UK, unlike US. 

Firstly, that's true three weeks. limited based age. 

Secondly, can't get second jab least 8 weeks got first. means reality although good vaccination rates overall, small fraction young people fully vaccinated. demographic large portion people crowd event. 

We know already teenagers people 20-40 far biggest number new cases UK. likely super spreader event.

The countervailing argument obviously long young people getting it, deaths hospitalisations stay manageable. far good front, we've absolutely rocketing cases restrictions planned remains seen bad fallout be. actually good reason this. 

Pfizer huge data-sharing deal Israel. entire country got lots Pfizer jabs, got early, tracking sharing information.  

We simply kind data Moderna, J&amp;J, vaccines. learned new incredibly stupid word today. way explained is. people also bend staring phone. nurse watching dozen people faces largely hidden. nice boost see whole face. Could save seconds. Look UK. sounds like bullshit. nurses doctors, surgeons, dentist, anyone wear mask jobs day get sick common ailments using mask work time? Really doubt it, close friend ER nurse never heard anything **This article written yesterday** pharma companies meeting **today** government possibility boosters. Things might change. mean least combative way, case comes tone. don‚Äôt know anyone personally like Arkansas Mississippi region really I‚Äôm curious. 

What‚Äôs good Arkansas? like living there? Could ... playing politics vaccine, at, incredible. telling that...the plague Spain spread mainly plane?  


I'll show out... I'm asking questions ignoring answers  Yeah, reason they're vaccinated, excuse. plenty excuses.  I‚Äôm vaccinated, helping watch infant. ‚Ä¶. yes, it‚Äôs I‚Äôm worried about. That‚Äòs difference Republicans think Democrats think. Democrats care community fellow citizens, apparently Republicans don‚Äòt give flying fuck.  


Lol flags, went Northern Wis month ago, still *Trump/Pence 2020* flags flying place. mean ffs, least update year! never Trump/Pence ticket gallows scene Jan 6. Strange birds people.  (That's bad.)  Well solution want then? pretty much either wait guidance wait booster isn‚Äôt recommended try sneak another shot something. Otherwise isn‚Äôt much else do. condolences deal many patients They'd sit inside anyway, others allowed go outside? ... need 70% vaccine rate reach herd immunity we're actually safe. Even vaccinated, others spreading around means chances new variant popping up. really want go back March 2020 there's variant renders vaccines obsolete?

This shit going away suck. could definitely manage it, people selfish assholes want even slightly inconvenienced. Precautionary Principle requires err safe side. actual data shows effectiveness current 2-dose schedule waning? wanting get approved advance, case? would difference running 30 cycles vs. 45 cycles however, correct? utilize convention quantitative PCR methods detect bacterial arthropod DNA pick different number cycles depending efficiency reaction, expected abundance, etc. Therefore would assume everything number cycles primer specificity sensitivity taken account. imagine they're running samples multiple times different number cycles? Sorry I'm genuinely curious, trying difficult. not! Goddamn Yeah, right death rate probably still falling due vaccines demographic shift. Cases UK doubled since June 27th. suggest doubling today‚Äôs death rate already priced in, minus reduction past two weeks. peak daily cases stays 50k might see 100 deaths per day short term. 

Winter another beast though depend overall vaccine coverage. Many western countries probably avoid fully formed wave flare ups likely happen countries. difference many cycles spun per PCR test? test positive anything important thing context. Chemistry test parts per quadrillion ...that 2.5 minutes earths 4.5 billion years. Context what‚Äôs important waited 4 weeks get second pfizer dose, story, side effects? Lmao can't speak rest Europe French fans' racism makes English ""booing players kneeling"" seem tame comparison wish would kept restrictions place state, governor complete trump suck up. Governor Power Grid also said schools remove covid related restrictions, like plexiglass distancing cannot require mask
 know, kids get sick. effective extent much mixing. [The German government lie First Fosun private company. 
 
So Gazprom. private military navy made Russian warships. 
 early investor bioNTech also bought exclusive distribution right greater China area including mainland China, Taiwan, Hongkong Macau. 
 
That change situation judgement. 
 want distribute vaccine regions, deal them. simple business rule. 
 
No, politics, business. Business intertwined politics state mafia. point people weighed reduced risk vs reward able open travel related industries, decided risk tolerable. Even covid get shot. boosts immunity seen reduce long covid symptoms. least vaccine spare. That‚Äôs good hear. Last checked US slowed crawl slowly rising 48%, EU continues steady increase. 

I‚Äôm waiting say it‚Äôs safe kids one old enough months. Delft city Holland.  long year isolation, even Covid thirsty. think that's going wack mole honestly time variant specific booster ready we'll onto next one even fast mrna vaccines tweaked. south african variant boosters tested one old news.

The hope counter variants continuing poke immune system stick keep antibody levels high even though naturally wane expected. Public bathrooms? that's problem meet people bathroom several scientific studies saying safe effective. pretty damn far ""completely unproven experiments"". approval imminent one comment one scientist pretty irresponsible ask me. Sure, there's one thing political economy like, screwdriver, tool use put away. That's Keynes made, example.

What a) turn weird religion constantly poring writings Prophet; b) ascribe evils world devils Prophet.

We would still pollution without capitalism. Sorry. option home school. also medical religious exemptions Right UK fully vaccinated 3% population. Free-dumbs! said trolling despite fact trolling. Source? 55% 85%? countries do.

-an Arkansan. Yikers Island Yes, understand fully. Unfortunately see even many people age (19), willing. severely doubt anything change mind, peoplw go ""against mainstream"" even though completely wrong.

On hand however, willing sacrifice freedom people restrictions put place rising cases caused unwilling get vaccinated.

In opinion, absolutely everybody, wants to, gets second dose, restrictions end reinstated unless variants immune vaccine emerge. Forcing unvaccinated people get tested shows etc. would useful also illegal immoral think. surge winter continued people would take vaccine. dispute that? Vaccines mostly end many U.S. wont take rest world still issues getting mean youth 40s. imagine 40+ done earlier 30s due dose 2 next week Current estimates around 95%, great. allready 88% people 45. 78.8% population 18, 95% saying yes, end around 75%. likely used younger people too. least 16, maybe even 12. highest vaccinated group 98.1% vaccinated, still rising. Washington almost 70% deaths 1-2, day statewide. Two countries. NEED mask vaccinated. breakthrough infections still pretty low glorified sniffles. 

What I'm concerned callous attitude towards Missouri citizens tells enough person. indefinite time.

What know vaccination drive Malaysia operates? realize we're massive wave right healthcare system strained? think people going sitting around saying, ""Nah, think I'll pass vaccine I'm receive right now, wait around months?""

You're suggesting waiting indefinitely wave. Highly foolish idea. Also, think depth. country's rules apply ours, different countries. SEA government. case confused, Malaysia Singapore. (It's kinda exhausting explain simple facts, are.)  Depending FDA CDC hears, boosters may recommended immune compromised elderly. great responses first time whose antibodies decay rapidly. thinking majority people may need one time/this year. countries do. matter time vaccines get imported. Last year Pfizer Moderna seem like pipe dream us...this year got both.   Potentially, higher vaccination rates offset that. Please consult medical professional, provide medical advice. I'm happy people rural Missouri economic boon, wow, yeah, that's really problematic.

As practice, bring masks travel lower vaccinated areas/badly ventilated indoor spaces. large spaces tons people (especially indoor). TL;DR: wearing masks inside COVID spreading epidemic levels big dick energy fully vaccinated person. Mine 23rd, 25 gonna happen huge amount people willing get vaccinated.  think booster needed depend people's tolerant risk.

If want get infection (i.e. worry long covid), want get booster since antibodies dropped due natural decay antibodies certain months vaccine escaped variants.

However, care get infection, get serious sick (i.e. protection severe disease/death), really need one since t-cell isotopes really changed variants.

Maybe.

The US still highly unvaccinated. might attitude ‚Äúfuck unvaccinated people‚Äù get accident causes major trauma need ventilator hospital filled dying Covid patients‚Ä¶ might think differently. 

The government needs make sure hospitals aren‚Äôt overflowing patients. already low vaxed areas. tricky situation. View OP link (in subject post). Government, seems two days old (admissions currently July 11). source, fact dashboard, OP uses dramatic statistic subject. source authority new Covid-19 cases, must logically also authority admissions, even tell alarmist story. link subject post. admission data July 11. 

Why search google July 4 data right front official data, much date? get it. guess strategy working. pedantic, that's article says. majority **mild** asymptomatic infections.‚Äù

So majority non-severe cases, expected. gonna way complex explain general public.

GBS rare disease. happens rarely general population healthy people, also happens rarely people catch flu, Covid probably diseases too. eliminate even necessarily reduce lifetime chance getting GBS getting J&amp;J vaccine.

And believe chance GBS 1 128,000 must also understand chance catching Covid neighborhood unvaccinated significantly higher that. make rational risk/benefit analysis understand still worth get J&amp;J vaccine that's one available you. unfortunately that's way much information general population, going fuel vaccine hesitancy unfortunately.

Just wanna add, thank GOD far nothing similar found Pfizer, even medical reasons epidemiological &amp; social ones, need vaccines public trust. many people died? Seems working ok far.. maybe Canada data point safety approach? UK exponential growth virus right now? 30,000 cases yesterday, equivalent ~100,000 US. clearly controlled right now.

Also nobody's going running double blind experiments ""Delta going hogwild Mongolia"" that's hilariously unethical totally made up, masks mandatory inside months, week two ago. Sorry. first one I've heard say this. ""You can't expect"" comments context sound ignorant me.

Obviously things go wrong strain comes immune vaccines, one expect that. things get much, much worse could wear one rest life. Hopefully won't, mentality ""I can't expected something inconveniences me"" weak. People live famines, floods, wars. Seeing someone complaining putting mask faces embarrassing. Ah, got Modernizer eh? don‚Äôt think hospitalization deaths spike way.

That's true. speak Ontario 80% 1 dose 50% fully vaccinated still restricted region North America.

We moving stage 3 Friday announced last Friday. suppose wait July 21 stage 3. Even stage 3 still requires social distancing, indoor capacity capped 50%, masks etc.

We currently indoor dining allowed, gyms, movies, theaters, organized sports nothing even though we've obliterated vaccine targets lowest case counts, hospitalizations, percent positive 10 months.

The majority people want NINE WEEK PLAN get stage 3. STILL plan full reopening. wanted restrictions removed quicker based above. people wanted full-on let 'er rip reopening.

Conservatives cut vaccine manufacturing beginning 80s believe. It‚Äôs long-standing issue couple variants lurking around, notably gamma (from brazil)

But there's guarantee gamma competitive delta, right? Eventually, they're duke out, one prevail other. early measure that? feel like physics probably complex scientifically understand spread overlaps real world. Arkansas Lib here, super owned. I'd ok stupids generating variants infecting people literally can't vaccinated. Well countries may able afford them. 

WTF  states vaccine surging areas people worst health worst healthcare systems. sure people areas won‚Äôt get vaccinated.  brought Bible Belt  Dude making shit look like black Plague himself, talking death rate lower 1% even way lower younger people.

If vaccines available everyone wants take one, arguments lockdowns measurements virus free country, everyone wants protect can. Probably few. instance, RSV covid present quite differently, especially young children... mention, subgroup isn‚Äôt even vaccinated yet. Yeah, I've seeing tons double posting lately. So... Catch-19? life pretty much back normal me. I'm concerned Delta variant vaccines effective it. Calculations technicals.

Taking casual look... 1600 breakthrough cases Ontario 6 millions fully vaccinated people. kids twelve get vaccinated. 2 doses? data shown first dose ~33% effective only? Even second dose, AZ shown 60% effective Delta variant, another thing consider.

People harp low death numbers, whilst good, I'm sure people ignoring potential strain long COVID cause individuals healthcare estimate Office National Statistics May, 1.1 million people UK reporting long Covid symptoms four weeks 6 March 2021. defined symptoms lasted four weeks initial infection, though two thirds people symptoms lasted 12 weeks. fifth said symptoms limited daily activities lot.

Other studies suggest numbers could considerably higher. study published June Imperial College, London, half million adults England reported Covid illness found third still least one symptom 12 weeks later. findings applied people England ill Covid, could mean two million people may experienced long Covid.' get it, US zero restrictions zero masks nearly 3 months now. Stadiums full, hospitals major cities overwhelmed hospitalization/death rates seem rising. 

Well, Orioles fan, tell long day coming stadium full. 

Be may. US big place many local differences, may 3 months now, MD, we've gone masks optional 2 months state (May 15), county slightly less (May 28) - still required public transportation, schools, health care childcare. 

It's actually funny difference. Folks around area still masking stores, went one county, were. That's difference county hotspot one wasn't. necessarily. new disease right limited options treatment prevention probably always case.

&amp;#x200B;

I exactly call 95% effective vaccine ""limited"". almost infectious  accept agree argument ultimately going live virus. Delta variant really, really infectious numbers UK quite alarming. Daily deaths gone 5-8 around 25-30 space month. said, I'm still accepting facts gamble let infection rates soar like doing. Double jabbed people still infected ill (my sister currently positive unwell OK).

Yes, Delta variant really infectious. there's probably going even infectious variant while, one than, etc etc. everyone choice vaccinated, little want continue yo-yo lockdown indefinitely. context, somewhere 300-1200 people dying UK week pneumonia flu (depending season attribute cause death). Covid par that, see little reason drop restrictions.I hope sister recovers quickly. full vaccination rates 50-65% northeast west coast, 30-40% deep south.

I seriously doubt deep south lot thoughtful insights vaccine safety. virus politicized. states 65 vaccination rate generally quite high well. Mississippi lowest rate 81.5%. Yea what‚Äôs point? first. find disrespect leave thing majority cases catch covid get immunity. Delta spreads faster becomes dominant.

The variants still there, less less them, Delta taking place. Yes, Delta infectious help.

I email say second would switched tell likely Moderna Biontech. get tomorrow afternoon. heard side effects worse mixing Vector mRNA maybe means challenge immune system. odds astronomical moment. vaccinated, way things worry bigger threat. study released last year showed North American field mice one susceptible animals Covid (along primates, cats, ferrets), apparently kind mouse commonly found inside North American homes nearly susceptible. recall European mice, think among susceptible, least. 

I idea, however, Covid variants changed animals susceptible, study reading definitely based original type Covid, longer what's going around. wish would publish animal research. Canada signed contracts everybody hedged rose top. Pre-orders Astra, J&amp;J, Novavax, Pfizer, Moderna maybe (Canada also Medicago trials believe) Orlando you? lived March rarely saw people wear masks consistently, even hospitals/doctors offices.

Influenza vaccines causing decades. looks like incidence incredibly rare, thankfully. spike protein (And highly immunogenic receptor binding domain AKA part actually hooks ACE2 receptor) mutated quite bit that's dragging vaccine efficiency down. vaccine efficiency likely never go 0%, get low enough herd immunity cannot achieved current vaccine, may well already hit point Delta vaccine efficiency 80s basic reproductive rate 6. may many effective ways bind ACE2 10 mutations keep popping different combinations, we'll likely need variant specific booster two really tamp we're going OK COVID killing hundreds thousands per year. common/severe vertigo? headaches well?

There plenty posts bashing would point.

But case bashing kinda point. contrary point, would say. Despite making clear headline, article referring Delta Kappa (previously called B.1.617.1) variants, brand new variants. Literally, Pfizer says new data Israel meeting US health officials discuss boosters. 

meanwhile, vague conspiracy theories. 

Yes, stance might change, getting new information. SUPPOPSED change new information says should. guys clubbing without testing masks distance? Luckily 75 billion surplus money.

Obviously entire reason think play part going forward. Prior infections &lt;10%, 52% fully vaccinated (including kids). Theres also going fair bit overlap there, also lot undiagnosed cases. 

However shakes out, optimistic complete success story. Government estimating could see 100-200 deaths/day time wave peaks, victory.

Any person 12+ wants vaccine access.

When over? I‚Äôm MO I‚Äôm planning leave state year another reason. I‚Äôm sick government cult created. vote R owns libs!! I‚Äôm done. Packing bags ‚Äúliberal California‚Äù New Years Eve  certainly didn‚Äôt mean cup lmaaaaaaooooo  Yea team half Michigan half California deal global locations it‚Äôs zoom calls matter what. everyone board 99% remote slow weeks maybe day office connect Fayetteville, Arkansas....and thats me. Less crowd. Social distancing leaving seat. spread matter what. Reminds scene Chernobyl Cheif Miners told dig tunnel 12m ground 6 protection, quoted ""Are telling going make difference."" Fayetteville, Arkansas....and thats me. happening country? happening country remember hearing, last year, genetic testing showed cases NY similar samples taken Italian European patients original Chinese version. Efficacy Sinovac found 83.5% latest results phase 3 trials, 20% higher AZ's phase 3 results. Oof. Better move goal posts forget [this England. Florida Europe.  July 9th, USA - new cases seem down, average daily new cases going up.  Wait, what? simple finding vaccine given particular site. rocket science. People US SG it. Meanwhile fighting get line shots. Thankfully enough it‚Äôs hunger game situation time lag around 2 weeks infection people landing ICUs another 2 weeks people starting die. groups vulnerable COVID-19 vaccinated, situation certainly less dire month ago. make mistake: People demanding drop lock measures still advocating people get sick, sometimes lasting consequences even die. exactly?

The correct solution work towards keeping incidence low immunization program kept running full steam. German RKI aims 85% vaccination rate push R0 1 vaccination alone. might doable Germany fall.  US 7-day average dipped 10k since March 2020, hasn‚Äôt exceeded 20k month.

No states reached hospital capacity. held true me. Saying ""vaccines safe"" reassure much seeing transparent data known risks. Nothing 100% without risk, accept, easier accept concrete numbers like ""1 40,000"" abstract assurance safety. Can't wait sugma variant let nature take course?

Have considered moving state fewer dumb people? US 7-day average dipped 10k since March 2020, hasn‚Äôt exceeded 20k month. Lol shifting goal post. informed also there. news still comes refuse get vaccinated want brand reschedule vaccination particular brand available. case registered announced Pfizer vaccines arrived country. know 99% entire vaccination use Pfizer next days. right. people know get jab want. Yeah, agree. They'll back Bill Gates shit executives horrible perspective work looks like right current age. accountant, going office people trying talk vs grinding tasks.

I love everyone saying ‚ÄúI miss office bla bla‚Äù okay 1 week noise canceling headphones avoiding eye contact anyone studies showed flu virus made, believe dogs, seek others social asymptomatic stage. literally made seek others cause spread. totally miss possibility young people might carried covid19 large degree simple never tested before.

If look COVID dashboard, clearly see covid19 particles increase. contact tracing rarely comes discos/clubs. 

It unlikely explanation covers everything. Wow, NYCHA looking health well-being tenants... speaking New Yorker I'm SHOCKED! /s 200 cases daily represent high number? Wtf..  sure whether ever Switzerland, 

Yeah live differences living conditions poor rich small Switzerland compared countries Europe. Even compared US developing countries.

You‚Äòre ignoring factors. Low wage workers low wage workers variety reasons. Take example low education resulting low wage work, person nake worse choices health due lacking education. cultural differences, e.g. certain migration backgrounds (which also linked low wages) much likely dismiss mental health issues resulting worse health outcomes. law suits employers, actually rather quick due special nature handled special court. Besides, even lose job, unemployment social welfare exists props people well.

Did ever deal situation? social security net nice all, isn‚Äòt (e.g. see nurses denied coverage ‚Äûthey couldn‚Äòt prove infected covid work""). It‚Äòs pretty mentally exhausting, imagine barely speak language work demanding job + kids single kids deal bs top. easy. would rather attribute difference Covid outcomes differences culture education. rich friends much likely see doctor even minor things ""poorer"" friend likely taking days going back work.

Again, interlinked factors affect eachother. Bet tell voted too‚Ä¶ executives horrible perspective work looks like right current age. accountant, going office people trying talk vs grinding tasks.

I love everyone saying ‚ÄúI miss office bla bla‚Äù okay 1 week noise canceling headphones avoiding eye contact anyone know 67% figure makes seem like Sinovac AZ similar, we're talking effectiveness (for Sinovac) vs efficacy (for AZ). Efficacy result Phase 3 double-blind trial whereas effectiveness real-world result many factors strongly affect results. fair comparison, need compare efficacy efficacy. Effectiveness harder compare unless get data scenario (e.g. data Chile month June 2021 vaccines). non-parent? live Arkansas fully vaccinated. sheer amount dirty looks get still wearing mask public astonishing. would think unvaccinated people would appreciate trying spread deadly virus them. [Introductions early spread SARS-CoV-2 New York City caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) New York City (NYC) spring 2020 vastly exceeded reported China many countries. early events led severe outbreak?

UK fully vaccinated: 51.6%

They might less vulnerabel long covid hits hard even 30 group. infect older people again. 
Even dont, eu world netherlands deep red vacations heavly doubt even fully vacced. behind, say they're much farther Nobody Vax south Here's thought, let people get die, die. Give vaccines countries actually want instead going waste  go back even time, prevent panic buy, stated masks work Covid.

This incredibly irresponsible, since spark Covid Mask denial. live Missouri. kids young vaccinated. school district ‚Äúmasks optional.‚Äù let nature take course? c) People travel stadium using public transport etc

d) people attend pubs/bars/restaurants hand etc

e) alcohol generally leads collapse social distancing mask wearing

f) 10% 60,000 would still 6,000.

g) duration event 2+ hours. go back even time, prevent panic buy, stated masks work Covid.  call skepticism least 90% conspiracies. mean it‚Äôs people don‚Äôt believe severity virus.

That's reason I've typically seen regarding vaccine skepticism. Mainly, pertaining safety vaccine (e.g., ""will vaccine make make magnetized, 5G cyborg?"").

There's really questioning ""the safety"" masks social distancing, mitigation measures risk I‚Äôm sure understand comment.

The point I'm making ""vaccine skepticism"" never vaccine's safety, like, all. There's option. Keep scrubbing.

The problem social media algorithmic recommendations bring like minded nutjobs together.

They need shunned isolated, YouTube, Facebook social media perfectly happy feed insanity group together. call skepticism least 90% conspiracies. Wonder autoantibodies present patients post-viral incapacitation? Would curious patients never recovered EBV, etc. unique COVID-19. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs much intellectual argument. nightclubs sporting events opening fully, highly doubt masks would've impact all. Exactly. Skeptics change minds presented evidence. appointment GP today said agreed personal risk assessment AZ vaccine clinic policy give I'll need find somewhere else receive it. FFS.    also cultural thing. north guys kissing/hugging time. mediterranian region it. source data? Iv seen numbers one give solid source. Last heard CDC stopped tracking covid cases outside hospitalizations deaths take macro view, societies accept less less time goes on. may turning point societies takes another step forward stem virus spread amongst us. Masks already commonplace cultures, expect see go forward. also expect mRNA vaccines viruses previously ‚Äúaccepted‚Äù.  vaccinated safe, go.. Oh confirm! biggest issue local school faced many parents want rid children horrid mask! Never mind went last year school learning thanks aggressively applying contact tracing, distancing, isolation infected. masks got way‚Ä¶.. One idiot board member taken aback COVID came stated was, ‚Äúso much scarier thought age (early 50‚Äôs, think) actually rethought vulnerable may be. she‚Äôs leading anti-mask ran elected platform she‚Äôd get mascot changed back Northstars it‚Äôs original, get this, Midgets. gets better. changed school little person student body. dumb self centered idiots. Grow already. fair natural selection action... Usually vaccine sceptic die sooner ergo less chance procreate even offspring might end taking progenitors demise cautional warning take vaccine instead.

The vaxx sceptic content creators killing consumers noone else left.  Meanwhile right across long border Germany, nightlife opened again.  absolutely right. I've learned people sub flat seem hate joy. Thank god power decisions.  cases corresponding increase hospitalisations according article. 

Assuming doesn‚Äôt change don‚Äôt see there‚Äôs problem - living COVID. Can‚Äôt stay locked forever ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è symptomatic, mild/cold-like?

But yes, let's allow hysterics drive approach borders, schools, etc etc... know, know yet tau variant impact things. Norway 25 39 last. 18-24 40-44 gets time. calculated would reduce cases quicker. I‚Äôd guess asymptomatic cases correlated lower viral load, I‚Äôm certain I‚Äôve read correlated lower transmissibility. 

I‚Äôm interested got asymptomatic superspreader theory add fine print? singled incidence apparently exceeded expect background statistically. trying say? feel like trying build point - make point try cute gotcha style questions... I'm really sure anyone would assume couldn't... Nope - live - know lots people around age getting text. Everything filled next week can't start booking til next Wednesday. Well, media states vaccines prevent death.

""Ask doctor immortality right you."" tell 

Only ask certain appealing symmetry, I'll wait immunology specialists recommend first. keen idea far happen product nearly ready sell.

The impression get balance science still pointing functional Covid immunity lasting several years. Boosters might needed immunocompromised/older people. fair enough Yes, hand ""removing restrictions soon"" crowd really small.

Two weeks ago chatting parents incoming rise numbers worries netherlands soon red list travel stuff (it quite apparent coming shift groeigetal) every parent like ""you really think bad?"" 

I think Rutte appeasing wappies, think following real middle, smarter way would torpedoe popularity. real way think dutch want, even though obviously wrong way it. Yup. dividing it, 86% adults vaccinated first dose. Different provinces different situations responses. 

For number theorized reasons (demographics, timing spring break 2020, high trust institutions) BC lowest cases North America Europe, Ontario lucky indoor dining closed year (IIRC) overloaded health care system. outbreaks, testing school hears tests, contact tracing reporting. might outbreaks among adults community, would total coincidence. Moderna got approved EUA CDC reputable WHO, more.

Sinovac approved anyone WHO. China's CDC trusted anyone outside China.

I hope see stark difference.

To top off, Sinovac's exec involved bribery around vaccine before.

I hope much ask get vaccine reputable company. weekly? 

Yeah gonna try least week needs global, won't. pandemic needlessly drag due lack cooperation hate wearing mask work. absolutely massive inconvenience, it‚Äôs also likely place would exposed. wearing mask store going bare-faced week work pointless security theater. want, I‚Äôm done wearing mask. Get mad people refuse get vaccinated, they‚Äôre ones dragging out. small number doses.

Apparently least 18 million... exactly small number. India crippled delta True decision mainly push people get vaccine (because better get jab nose every time want something). working, main vaccine appointment website crumbling record requests (20k per minute). Ignorance bliss ey? *""Look, it's..... learning!*"" heard increase case counts (mostly among young people), really ""explosion issues"" regards preventable deaths and/or overloaded health care systems. never. Got it. seems late age too, i'm younger you, also BC (not high risk area) second dose week. read England, less associate Europe associate US south. terms herd immunity, yes is. Damn food looks good get saying outcome totally foreseeable.

BUT! dutch take Corona really serious hate restrictions. dutch think pandemic, biggest tragedy many deaths. overworked health care. even lockdown. 

The national tragedy hated mask ordinance (I'm exagerating alot).

When go store, sometimes stopped mask told wear anymore....

Bottom line, think dutch government good job making everyone country equally unhappy. Norway win hands down. 84-75 98.1% vaccinated. ""eligible"" people, everyone. 74-65 95.2%. others still rising. likely end 95% adults vaccinated start younger ones. reason slower use AZ J&amp;J safety concerns. 

88% people 45 gotten first dose, number still rising (the 45-54 group offered dose yet). polled like 1.8% says want vaccine, 2% says want wait whatever reason. 

When 18 offered first dose 75% total population vaccinated. vaccinate 12 18 year olds end around 80%. think unlikely vaccinate younger people, need little higher cowerage get R 1. DISCLAIMER: suggesting doctor professional source medical scientific information, said, inference myocarditis shows commonly adolescents young adults anyway, instances showing post vaccine enough bother about? Lol perfect. Tell vaccinated people wear mask we‚Äôre super spreaders don‚Äôt symptoms we‚Äôre going like crazy  concept FYI‚Äî Israel‚Äôs 64% number doesn‚Äôt coincide similar studies UK, Canada Singapore show protection ~80% reading right really snarky ""rather abide country's privacy laws, we'll block seeing article altogether""? Nice, oh, NBC. Good know. Current future generations paying it, across world Yes no. Depends amount shedding asymptomatic infection, whether shedding gets pet cat, dog, hamsters mice infected too. amazing, saying ‚Äúsinglehandedly?‚Äù US donating 80 million vaccines around world (China point donated around 30 million) US announced 500 million donation.

Not mention India, Canada, Japan, Australia donated lot spare vaccines. Lol what

*Officials monitoring lambda variant carries number mutations could potentially aid spread. variant seven mutations virus‚Äôs ‚Äúspike protein‚Äù compared original strain SARS-CoV-2 detected Wuhan, China.

Some mutations potential increase transmissibility virus **reduce ability certain antibodies neutralize, inactivate, virus, according WHO**. example, lambda mutation known F490S located spike protein‚Äôs receptor-binding domain (RBD), virus first docks onto human cells. paper published July issue journal Genomics identified F490S likely ‚Äú**vaccine escape mutation**‚Äù could **make virus infectious disrupt ability vaccine-generated antibodies recognize variant.***

Sauce Oh okay.üá®üá¶üëçüòÖ thought Canada strict restrictions. guess brainwashed media.  major concern, risk basically vaccines thread alluding to, single J&amp;J specifically? 

Just hurt stock? give anti vaxxers ammo? flu shot publicize every year, publicize this? hurt vaccination effort? Add fine print like flu vax. may noticed delta caused explosion issues many parts world previously covid well control pandemic. Good Job Canada approving mixing matching evidence data!!!
Health Canada doesn‚Äôt even studies, rely studies countries!
Thank-you putting everyone‚Äôs life risk! Except vaccine made China would doubt claim.. vaccinated get infected too. nowhere near 87% vaccinated. current figure 67% least one dose 51% doses. think point suppression vaccination arguable 51% get 70 80 percentile range. 

As unable financially mentally continue lock down: Firstly, virus care financial markets state mental health....It takes root vulnerable communities wherever encounters kills people. Breakthrough infections still likely dangerous elderly immuno-compromised people virus community, dangerous them. 

Secondly, I'm advocating continued lockdown anyway....I'm advocating stronger messaging around wearing masks public spaces default behaviour, places like night clubs exception instead rule. measures reduce transmission virus value makes public spaces vulnerable people breathing air safer, whilst allowing want risk exposure night club so. things stand guarantee least half population wearing masks indoors 19th July UK ""they anymore"".

Finally....Who knows winter. new dangerous variant going emerge, announce immediately birth contained....It quietly spread community wherever considered ""Normal Covid"" starts killing people. time seeded enough travel infect regions like previous variants done. Epidemiologists agree trasmission community, likely scenario becomes.....It's numbers game. Thanks this. weekly? 

Anyone hopeful numbers low due 4th July? see increase Delta prominent variant? isn‚Äôt said. going play Seoul ballads? sounds like great news. Christmas time me. number vaccines per capita inversely proportional number pickup trucks per capita, everyone knows live country everything made Russia suddenly comes vaccine no? (And vaccine even made China case).

Ummm... vaccines no-no imported China Taiwan... huge list items services banned importation China Taiwan. Anything national security, including vaccines, goes strict import processes. acting like paper towels vaccines level restrictions... Denmark. [That vaccination going ""*weeee!*"" :-) Going Munich *after* Oktoberfest probably best time go. even currently unpredictable unexplainable scenario happens virus evades mRNA vaccines remain infectious (which understanding would ridiculously unlikely),

I would confident, vaccines already respond differently variants.

+ enormous evolutionary new variants.. on, successful variants selectioned capacity evade vaccines..

And variants spread faster vaccinations campaign. higher percentage multigenerational households suffered older folks higher risk exposure. USA, included places like crazy outbreaks seen across Navajo nation.

Los Angeles well. lot dense multi-generational, sometimes multi-family households pretty catastrophic segments population. :( Right? Super weird. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Taiwan ""refused buy it""? That's got point final contract Taiwan BNT drafted, BNT back last minute? Canadian subs, people clamouring full-on let 'er rip reopening least last month talking outrage we're taking measured approach. 

This perfect reason we're taking measured reopening approach.

Our cases also Netherlands pre-surge, relatively similar vaccination numbers.

The Netherlands perfect example happen throw caution wind try rush everything open still halfway vaccination campaign infectious variants running rampant. hate deprnding idiots. looked news? went 11k Covid infections 19k week. That‚Äôs 40% increase. fully vaccinated: 51.6%
Netherlands fully vaccinated: 38.8%

Not significant difference would say.   People always find something complain think counting fetting covid. fucking optimistic. Government holding vaccination campaigns since vaccinations became possible, think mainly statement minister health, although try watch news much lately get depressed."
