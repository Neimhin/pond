0,2021-09-22," eh, ""fact check"" based ""missing context"" pretty weak me, barely fact check all. treat one study gospel limitations, mean takeaways this.

also, ""fact check"" aimed people saw social media post instagram, likely misleading. good stuff like gets put there, different audience people posting (it ends instruction try get infected covid study lol).

i still comfortable saying idea natural infection provides weaker protection vaccines outdated. Maybe, logically wrong, colateral damage.

I downvoted logic moralists dont, prefer us reject society came back tribalism little cost lives instead prioritizing quality life prosperity people.

We die anyway, elders already lived enough, instead focus people building lives future? completely red last week? California reduced recently Yep. I'm vaccination, delaying gotten it. myself, nervous due baby Feb breastfeeding, waited 6 months. Coincidentally, right approved it. kids, 1 that's age group, 4 children, I'm inclined wait either authorize 6 months approved.

They're getting flu shots Monday. interesting see DeSantis win political office supporters/voters dying. low percentage medically exempt. Probably less 1%. problem intensely political people think “putting away politics” means agreeing them. People uncorrected behavioral/addiction issues denied transplants procedures likely fail, ethical judgement them. doctors see addiction medical condition greatly reduces odds success give organ better candidate, even ""better"" candidate morally contemptible. 

Assume robbed ATM stabbed, police shoot robber. arrive hospital, doctors prioritize person critical without considering one patient criminal inflicted wounds other. could certainly make ethical argument victim treated first. Cant fuck can't breath......this surprise anyone. Israel like 10% anti-vaxxers among adults.

Much higher among 12-15 yrs old reason.  county nearly 2 million people, vaccination rate 83% (88% one dose), average deaths per day 2.1 people. That's illustrative problem California elsewhere; area fine others terrible. Covid largely disease unvaccinated unmasked. Totally insane. People highly infectious even starting day two symptoms start.  link article, according wife, MCPS sent email effect sometime week. irresponsible them.

Nevertheless, wasn’t outbreak. logical explanation though announced vaccine mandate kept anti-vax folks buying tickets showing up.

Would (I’m assuming you’re unvaccinated) buy tickets show announced vaccine mandate 1) hope wouldn’t check papers, 2) knowing wouldn’t get refund checked denied entry? Ace 2 receptors man's penis balls? Get used happens every nurse traveling nurse? I'm sure every nurse considering switching right now. aren’t open public. Sure, public uses them. one pay allowed on.

But wouldn’t like public library, anyone go free. Would agree?  Hope 3% get fired 5-6 different children 5-6 year olds? True. jobs draw line. What's opinion though? could bomb COVID existence, would probably American.  discussing inhalation, use hydrogen peroxide could mix cleaning power ammonia bleach inhale germ fighting vapors concoction?  not.

Life vaccinated people get back normal. anti-vaxxers go screw tbo. Teachers’ worth Florida? Near zero! Tenet (the Texas-based company owns St. Vincent’s now) cares making investors happy everything else, including staff patient safety. not. Commercial air travel form public transportation. 

You keep trying gotcha moment tired wrong yet, going happen. wants kill people? seriously? anyone read headline confused, Friday's vote agency's Vaccines Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. FDA confirming recommendation granting booster emergency use authorization. still need recommended advisory panel CDC expected happen tomorrow. So, looking link, roughly rate miscarriage general, mostly early on. That’s good news. vaccination supported ACOG (the main professional organization ob-gyn US) reports fertility problems among trial participants, risk v benefit calculus seems become clearer time. Especially rise Delta variant. 

Individual patients talk doctors course, especially difference J&amp;J vaccine others. someone clotting disorder, rare allergy, unique situation might fewer options.    reasoning rejecting boosters everyone 16 “a risk myocarditis.” Thanks saying loud FDA. isn’t subset Americans focus solely sentence make Facebook meme. 

The FDA CDC need better PR team. Atrocious messaging throughout entire ordeal. So, roughly rate miscarriage general, mostly early on. That’s good news. vaccination supported ACOG (the main professional organization ob-gyn US) reports fertility problems among trial participants, risk v benefit calculus seems become clearer time. Especially rise Delta variant. 

Individual patients talk doctors course, difference J&amp;J vaccine others. someone clotting disorder, rare allergy, unique situation might fewer options. didn’t forget. We’re even talking virus now. applies OG virus. Delta variant indeed deadly kids. Californian I'm going sit awfully smuggly, thank masks bullshit vaccines bullshit COVID bullshit, insist upon flooding hospitals? stick guns take horse dewormer home? go hospital fling poo doctors? go hospital something bullshit? wasn’t confirmed. vaccine checks incredibly lax didn’t even verify ensure weren’t faked.  They've good since 1865 number people hospitalized COVID-19 Los Angeles County dropped 1,000 first time two months — underscoring region’s slow steady progress turning tide latest coronavirus Tuesday, 991 coronavirus-positive patients receiving hospital care countywide. That’s 40% start September, state data mid-August — height current Delta-variant-fueled wave — nearly 1,800 people countywide hospitalized COVID-19 region also seen significant decline number people ill enough require intensive care. Tuesday, 305 patients intensive care units throughout county, 31% drop since beginning month. someone love “worthy sacrifice.” God forbid rural states medical care  700,000-person study   yeah.. tell Swedish people.. Swedish dead people. immunity achieved percentage people area vaccinated pathogen high pathogen doesn’t enough vectors spread beyond isolated cases.

Herd immunity generally happens vaccination rate mid-to-high 90%’s. everyone saying get vaccine, hit herd immunity, long maintain herd immunity levels, Covid won’t concern anymore. 

This everyone gets vaccinated measles diphtheria even though basically nobody gets measles diphtheria anymore. high vaccination rates diseases mean ever get random, isolated cases (save small outbreaks among homeschooled kids raised anti-vax dip shits. That’s true, whole picture. longer pandemic allowed fester, chances even deadlier variant Delta could emerge, bite us rear end. mention economy QoL continue suffer can’t return normalcy.

So even I’m fully vaccinated, I’m continuing pay price others help end pandemic, won’t.   means unvaccinated people contact infected person incentive avoid quarantine, keep working. 
I’m really convinced good idea. guess so. still, it’s pretty insane they’re still going hell despite high vaccination rates. sure log applies anymore. 

It doesn’t. Delta means kids likely *asymptomatic* spreaders compared adults. Yeah, gonna say, say hypertension, diabetes, etc. I’m guessing won’t really care trust you’re telling truth. 

Or, people qualify work. I’m healthcare worker/teacher/bartender/waiter etc. Gonna free home inventory tho  anything like first round shots, pharmacy's prod much self-attest higher risk.  require masks air travel? private indoor spaces. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Assuming masks work, put ones refuse can’t get shot - us part. tried Walgreens. already made appointment attested online… laid piece paper front different diseases said “which have?” Well truthful answer none. said pregnant last dose 8 months ago. also doctor note. said didn’t care, wasn’t eligible sent way. I’ve heard several similar experiences Walgreens. However, hearing get cvs issue tomorrow!

Edit: yes could continued lie chose disease. wasn’t mentally prepared hoping say yes no. honest, I’m terrible liar. froze. Hahah Well we're locking down, remote learning, instead guilting people (who care) trying get vaccines.  
I dunno people still hopeful ""goes away."" kidding me... Got third Pfizer yesterday. 35 year old male. Biggest problems major depressive disorder high blood pressure (due stress since I’m good physical shape due gym ear) that’s worse parents. regrets. #PfizerGangGang tell right now, 100% know true, otherwise say that. Think it. saw someone heard religion thought, ""I better get first. Now's chance prove true."" really, trying convince themselves. **If really think true, mind people finding it.**

Think like this. Let's say gas station street giving away free gas. go say ""Is gas really free?"" people like ""Yeah! Go inside get voucher!"" go realize gas free members only. become member, want gas. get voucher, fill car, leave, never come back. Well, sooner later gas tank empty see post online gas station telling people go get free gas, **but made decision never go back need feel justified it.** head, there's question, think, ""Did really give free gas life? would make turn offer free gas life? sounds like great deal! people going go gas station, fill car free, going go well them, **and going wonder I'm same. want seem foolish!** wait! Maybe tell gas actually dangerous, broke car. people think I'm fool!""

So, order prevent people thinking badly them, decide start rumor gas actually broke car. start posting online gas gas station actually full lead, safe, killing people! Even though that's true.

They know free gas completely fine. know it. option live world free gas *isn't* fine. else giving up? That's desperate lie people.  AFAIK doctors giving label.

Only option go different provider lie age.

Insane hyperbole parents foaming mouth they're 6-year-old wear mask one time school: upvotes! Reasonable pushback hysteria hyperbole: downvoted hell. God gives people free agency works mysterious ways. words, mine.  It’s already case anyone wants additional shot get it. Pharmacies US vaccinating anything pulse. 

Approval certainly increase number people getting g third shots, it’s happening lot already. Fuck really? FL blue cross..... least I'm vaxxed happens, natural.

There nothing could do. Agreed. left Utah years ago desire go back. Whats even entertaining people's employers ""duh gubmint"" one talk police state infringing rights. least employed people anyways.  someone doesnt want go school, problem, arbitrary, ostracized reopen people think differently it, problem.


There problem thinking differently, cherished.


But simply logical reason open schools right now, know us information, actions respected.   theory ivermectin clinical experiment showed success India, ivermectin treats COVID, ivermectin kills hookworm.

No hookworm means healthier patient, likely survive COVID.

It makes sense, highlights reason multiple, well-run clinical trials important scientific recommendation medicine. results ivermectin vs COVID repeatable different country without hookworms?

I'm sorry devastation country suffered. America deaths reported, suspect many countries shocked true scale loss calculated, we'll lose unenviable distinction. hope. They're going open borders either positive reproductive growth (epidemic) negative (suppression). positive results good.

But models based complete guesses essentially determine result. information available make models accurate. headline like essentially telling us already know: 75% vaccination infection-gained immunity lead significant epidemic death rate similar US seeing now. Slight nitpick, acetaminophen thing Tylenol ibuprofen thing Motrin. consistently minimized covid made point many kids die, ignoring possible negative effect becoming infected. 

Your kid would miss class time exposed covid. one school exposed. infrequent, assuming people responsible go they've exposed, test negative know spreading others.

We know people asymptomatic spread covid. That's proven fact. exposed 100% required either isolate tested. 

If that's rule school, school wrong. Availability groups, front facing teachers? Well! Florida's new Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, MD fucking idiot.   Yeah company vacation planned October got cancelled cause covid uptick July/August. trip planned NOLA got hit hurricane, got cancelled. 

So feel yah.  never understand US paid sick days (long term unlimited) people revolt streets lack this.  * Quantity lives  assume he's fully vaccinated plebs  actually know this? second jab April. don’t want running winter period look actual epidemiological sources I’ve provided. 

A lot worldometers data isn’t updated. CFR data atrocious. 

Canada California CFRs well .2%. 

Here’s Korea want another country. young folks low. Please check data, it’s off. saw one lady without mask Jewels last week, saw asshole plates get kicked gas station day whine outside--as know there's statewide mandate. Whatever they're paying poor employees ain't enough deal crazy bullshit.

British Columbia kids kindergarten grade 3 masks optional grades 4 masks mandatory.. make sense, wear them? asymptomatic actually pre symptomatic beginning pandemic. distinguish “booster” “3rd shot”. booster originally meant administered 8 months following second shot, criteria qualifying would broad. 3rd shots meant administered certain immunocompromised individuals least 28 days following second shot make (assumed) diminished immune response. shots substantially same, administration times different (although I’m sure many immunocompromised individuals nearing 8-month mark anyways). thinking That's studies incredibly flawed. example: response rate low (11.6%), participating schools missing information ventilation improvements. However, incidence per 500 students similar participating (3.08 cases) nonparticipating (2.90 cases) schools, suggesting systematic bias might low. Finally, data cross-sectional study cannot used infer causal relationships

The ""70%"" number based odds infection independently associated self-report wearing face covering (55.8% versus 80.8%; OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.2–0.5), avoiding common areas (53.8% versus 67.5%; OR = 0.6; 95% CI = 0.4–0.9), observing social distancing (54.7% versus 70.0%; OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.3–0.8), compared service members report behaviors

Not masks created equal. one friend sends kid kn95 another sends kids neck gaiter. It’s economic decision, scientific one.

I really hate pay that, think it’s better epidemiological perspective stick current rules.

Edit add: opinion testing, free everyone reason avoid it.  Oh okay. don’t really know essential 50/50 bad nearly 70% vaccinated. seem high population vaccinated maybe it’s *terrible*?  People test results well. people always buck rules money that.

Vaccinated: 900

Unvaccinated: 100

100 unvaccinated get COVID, 450 vaccinated get COVID (50% protection)

16 unvaccinated hospitalized 16% unvaccinated. 16 vaccinated hospitalized = 1.7% vaxxed (10 times less unvaxxed) 3.5% infected/vaccinated.

SO, 50% hospitalized patients VAXXED 10 times less likely there.

2 unvaccinated die = 2% unvaxxed. 1 vaccinated dies = .1% vaxxed.

Not entirely correct I've explained instances. 

COVID death rate heavily age stratified. Take Economist. Add vaccination risk assessment end 1/10 risk death elderly (and conditions) comparison no-vaccine. still means lot deaths.

Of course, refuse vaccination higher risk. see however risk vaccinated 80yo may comparable *unvaccinated* 60yo.  

So, NZ society must decide still want pursue Zero COVID strategy face unnecessary deaths, restrictions social confrontations epidemic management inevitably bring. Lol let point. Enjoy!

Are misreporting deaths... Again...? Still...? Maybe...? unnecessary restriction freedom. Data Israel shows vaccinated carry virus infectious unvaccinated, likely asymptomatically infected. Therefore justification vaccine passports. vaccinated protected serious disease vaccination. unvaccinated take risk vaccinated. They're 12. Florida seemed leveled - everyone infected already infected mitigation measure put place? get worse winter?    compare flu deaths?

If lower... job done, mission accomplished.

If higher... well, permanent isolation awaits. People wearing masks it’s required, burning altruistic desire. second mandate lifted short weeks, vast majority dropped masks immediately.

More gyms LA saying fuck requiring them. People desperate get required masks, one wants cause scene Trader Joe’s. Seriously, could ended last March/April world took seriously. What's strategy misinformation? guess strategist calculated every 1 death gain X new supporters? Looks like wave Florida ... COVID die like that? thought mitigation measure Florida?

Vaccine shots least kids problems.  Yeah buy predictions anymore.

My optimistic guess still bad winter wave (thanks anti vaxxers) covid slowly becomes endemic exposed possibly catching throughout lives. 

Vaccinations still make difference though catch it. Fortunately, mine 5, we'll hopefully see approval soon. pray much longer really little ones like yours, u/pomonamike.

The COVID vaxx introduces protein spike virus shell body, 100% inert, zero chance actually getting COVID it. Would like worrying getting food poisoning plate food it.

When get mRNA vaccine, tiny little piece mRNA code gets passed cells near injection site, causes cells build bunch little spike/sucker looking bits know various illustrated pics COVID virus. There's virus, little protein strands. leave cells, body identifies foreign attacks them...and immune system recognizes protein spike.

If happen actually get exposed COVID that, immune system immediately attacks kills virus instead allowing fester explode inside several days coming correct response.

Inoculation hand practice introducing body version actual disease build immunity it, legitimate risk getting ill that.

Everyone get vaccinated. need open conversation everyone getting vaccinated might enough. ""threat others want treated"" seems applicable here.  started indoor smoking sections non- smoking sections smoking section usually smaller. smokers first presented choice wait hour table choose smoke get table 20 minutes. time indoor bans started lot smokers used forgoing smoking table anyway.  (Used work restaurants college years) beyond help. mean promote it?  resmember seeing stats couple weeks ago, 2 billion people vaccinated worldwide. type virus we've never able vaccinate against, made given 2 doses almost 1/3 human population short time. incredible, amazing, see happens really pushed. mRNA virus, encouraging research coming diseases therapies, like CRISPR, HIV vaccine made, tested, unfortunately failed, quite spectacular think it! Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol reckless would go Florida December? early 20s vaccinated. Hoping get booster going. That's people try broaden people's day right, want themselves. here, buddy.

Maybe we'll get superpowers! Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol  That's real problem right selfishness. GO CVS reflexes lacking, totally went head. Thanks 👍🏻 Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol Medicaid/Medicare mandate would logistical nightmare (I experience government systems). Medicare recipients mostly land 65-and-older category, highly vaxxed age cohort anyway.

*Edit*: Typo. AZ radar US, FDA currently want touch mix-and-match.

UK plans covered here: like want avoid using AZ booster unless mRNA vaccines contraindicated due allergies like, AZ Pfizer recipients get boosters. Like, even get kids ain't gonna look right? follow criteria EUA?   Florida bothering rules?  1. people get infected vaccination acquire N-antibodies?

2. N-antibodies protective symptomatic severe disease? I'm sorry, even lie statement like this? one favors?

Get hold yourself.   see anti-Christian bias comment. mean insult offend it. But, belong Christian church (the Church Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints) actively encourages members obtain evidence belief personal experience.

It true Christians generally wild truth claims: resurrection, miracles, angels, visions, etc. know one know truth things spiritual experience. manner can't fully described words, one simultaneously *feel understand* spiritual things.

To non-believer, sounds crazy. almost paradoxical element type experiences already willing believe willing act belief. skeptic cannot evidence. Thus, skeptic becomes skeptical, believer believes more.

I expand like. study?

Of 827 woman end, 700 live births, majority gotten shot third trimester. remaining 100 participants gotten shot 1st 2nd trimesters, meaning majority group wound abortion.  school we’re discussing, yea? *Zero* kids vaccinated. many immuno compromised people died? won’t ever know. 

Yea, odds low, encourage read law large numbers. Tl;dr; people still debilitated dying, even scenario illustrate. *lot* people.

With much stake easy preventative measure, it’s picture entitlement dismiss them. Oh nice. spread children likely symptoms. Nice  Well day young probably pisses 480 45 states reporting deaths age 21,000 hospitalizations.  looks like there's 70% reduction risk infection wearing mask according examples cited  Wooo, fuck yeah Illinois! We've hit peak we're way down, Wooooooo!

Fuckin finally! Things different Delta. know kids transmit disease like groups … high % won’t get it.

To clarify, kids likely ***asymptomatic*** they’re infected (compared adults), asymptomatic folks significant contributor community spread, especially unvaccinated groups aren’t masked social distancing. [We found evidence greater asymptomaticity children compared elderly, lower asymptomaticity among cases comorbidities compared cases underlying medical conditions. **Greater asymptomaticity younger ages suggests heightened vigilance needed among individuals, prevent spillover broader population average 79%, expect elderly younger it. much need data, change overall numbers. CDC study 87 overall, 81 elderly, like 93 60 iirc. central Ohio, Columbus surrounding area high density hospitals. Children’s Hospital primary care facility (I believe) cares minors. tough shape right cannot handle bit surge. Additionally, cases bad around Franklin county get tested anywhere showing symptoms. cases much higher everyone thinks is, reason. Columbus Public schools system surrounding suburbs failed kids allowing mandating remote learning school year. Schools notifying parents positive cases within child’s classroom. get minimum three emails per week kid’s school new positive cases reported, well classroom, yet contacted needing quarantine. It’s going get much worse gets better, fear nowhere close hitting peak. Yeah, unvaccinated gremlins worry about. flew cross country Florida Cali nice 3 hour layover Texas I've sick 4 days now. I'm fully vaccinated, wore double mask, wipes sanitizer, packed tight ""free breathing"" a-holes flights. staff vaxed great, need rest country follow suit.

I one allowing vaccinated people fly, dine indoors anything else. I'm tired mouth breathers. Depends state, eh? unvaccinated person becomes infected covid, end ICU recover continue refuse vaccinated believe natural immunity help them. think? think gone severe covid symptoms cannot get sick again? piece shit asking disingenuous questions. You’re welcome!  you’re vaccinated don’t need worry astronomically small chances dying asymptomatic person spreads covid you. you’re unvaccinated happens, well, that’s you.  put us 7th inning still 6th? old men following news stations haven’t erections long time. still get sick pay. primarily affects unvaccinated (without medial reason), contact someone tested positive (i.e., quarantine), *don't* actually Covid (because sick pay). article clear this, unfortunately.  FYI. I’m double vaxed. even proof vaccination put tshirt. Check post history. many asymptomatic people unknowingly spread disease killed others?

Nobody knows; way know. Oh well, right? Nothing done, right? Reasonable, prudent precautions tyranny, right? rheumatoid arthritis methotrexate hydroxocloroquine. understanding vulnerable dying covid, perfect petri dish new variant (because immunosuppressants take, takes forever clear basic cold).

I fully vaccinated Moderna Pfizer (immunity test showed antibody reactivity, GP recommended get second course). unvaccinated 10 year old. live beautiful, rural area 50% vaccinated now, full ICUs. 

I basically lockdown since Covid hit US; watching news knew coming. daughter school online, husband works home, essentially give career real estate agent.

lol. Thank Montana, Idaho, company! Ruining states well. 
Firstly, linked preprint languishing server since March … **before Delta**. data stale. 

Second, kids likely **asymptomatic** they’re infected. 

Third, asymptomatic infections huge contributors community spread, especially completely unvaccinated groups people aren’t masking social distancing. 

Soooo, [scientists actually recommend **more** vigilance less none. 

From found evidence greater asymptomaticity children compared elderly, lower asymptomaticity among cases comorbidities compared cases underlying medical conditions. **Greater asymptomaticity younger ages suggests heightened vigilance needed among individuals, prevent spillover broader community**. infuriates me.

I starting go beyond thought. can’t trust medicine science enough get vaccinated, business going hospital get care science still don’t trust. 

I think people right refuse vaccine. time also banned coming hospital (for COVID-19) could vaccinated. Fauci apparently defended FDA’s decision Friday, makes feel better it. like, actually devil?

Pfizer vaccine first launched, research showed provided virtually 100% protection death. Since then, it’s plummeting fast, even accounting increased numbers who’ve vaccinated. 

Israel actually perfect case study since they’ve 80%+ vaxxed stable levels 6 months now, yet vaccinated individuals keep making larger percentage new deaths.

Nice. Regarding ones refusing vaccine due use fetal cells (which research development stage, actually vaccines themselves), ""do research"" crowd obviously done research. 

Some common medications also used fetal cell lines:

If DeSantis wants get rich I'd fine, let insurance companies thus vaccinated pay it. 

Let unvaccinated fully pay pocket. Live FL; moved pandemic (but full vaccination). It’s exactly describe here. people state get sick go receive life-saving EUA drug based stem cell research, campaign contributions grow. It’s simple. evil.

Solano County, still Bay Area county without indoor mask mandates, 14 day average cases 54.5% 14 day average hospitalizations 21.6%.

Source: read, too. called around every practice hospital large metro area, put feelers everyone network, couldn’t find single one.

There two parts:
1) getting prescription. Provider going FDA AAP guidance, bosses/legal team likely say no. even get past that,
2) getting actual vaccine. Places hand vaccine bound FDA EUA, strict guidelines.

If find place, great. practice don’t think really exist right now. People awful. Throwing feces doctors mistreating staff ugh.  That's individual states decide. FDA regulate specific point. Mine too, except also go way make testing campus possible vaccinated students. know covid transmitting, students can't get tested. They'll get refused even risk reprisal try get access campus testing. WTF.... Ask relative mine one 21,000? point stands. That's what's bothering most... kiddie vaccines right around corner, much protect then? fuck De Santis. Seriously, trying kill kids. suspect happening everywhere.

One primary tenets clinical medicine harm. debate ill appointed surgeon general harm going evidence based medicine.  saying loud FDA. isn’t subset Americans focus solely sentence make Facebook meme.

At point people lost, won’t convinced.

I’d rather FDA CDC speak clearly, loudly honestly worry giving “ammunition” people. friend Portugal says everyone always done, wear masks indoors outdoors. said one fights it, supposed to. shot available, went get it. Honestly issue even adults friggin’ suck masking kids even so. see people “masking” really masks half constantly “taking little bit” touching outside masks rubbing eyes. Like 1/2 people using masks horrible job it.

If actually trained everyone mask usage used medical grade masks everyone we’d probably get better numbers.

At point vax hope stupid new variant spawns delta gives idiots herd immunity say exactly? point shit. know nothing. medical worker Florida, pushing abortion law similar Texas, I'd leave. That's really helpful statistic considering 80% population vaccinated. 2/3's last peak, CLIMBING! Wonderful.  sad, really, think it... people trust Pfizer stiffy pills, Covid19 Vaccine...

Of course vaccine right thing everyone get right away. Oh yes. That's 100% obvious. People hesitant new things. rocket science. kids, they're vaccinated, too, kids covid vaccinated FDA EUA.

Canada saw bump cases loosened restrictions summer assumption relatively high vaccination rates would cause huge surge cases, hospitalizations death. Delta variant dominant became dominant end summer many provinces saw exponential growth re-enact restrictions.

The closest province Newfoundland Labrador 73.6% fully vaccinated. know, province population 520,000 1.4% Canada's total population (38M). Yukon Territory 75.6% fully vaccinated population 43,000. 

There two provinces 80%+ first doses. Newfoundland Labrador Prince Edward Island (population 160,000). sure current vaccination rates provinces doing, relatively, well 0.1% second doses per day. province could get 80% fully vaccinated 2 months. consider ""days away"".

Canada ""bad shape"" unvaccinated driving cases, hospitalizations death. delta variant dominant (99%+ provinces) caught provinces guard reopening plans made Alpha Gamma variant. summer little restrictions provinces cases started increase exponentially put back mask mandate, limit gatherings hotspots vaccine passport. 

Most provinces okay (Ontario/Quebec/Manitoba/Atlantic Provinces make 2/3 Canada's population). BC cancel surgeries transport people ICU remote communities (where cases exponentially increasing low vaccination rates) bigger cities. Alberta Saskatchewan (the two lowest vaccinated provinces) seeing health care system almost maximum capacity, even surge beds Alberta transporting ICU patients provinces. 

In provinces fully vaccinated people make 80% eligible population (12+) responsible 30% cases, 20% hospitalizations 15% ICU. Numbers change province province ballpark figures. family members vaccinated, wouldn’t need worry dying caught covid. refuse get vaccine die covid, that’s obviously unfortunate ultimately them. sure we’re suddenly sympathizing anti-vaxxers.  like ""vaccinations, losing weight, exercising, eating fruits vegetables, everything"" CDC approves it, need pass 5 panels Bureau Public Health. there, Biden must approve take booster get least 4 letters approval Supreme Court. glad they're keeping safety mind?



 I'm vax-hesitant due worries health risks (btw, already Covid Mar. 2020, still keeping safe till particular choice vax becomes available) giving anti-vaxxers ammunition much it'd deprive vaccine-hesitant useful information. 



Many vaccine-hesitant folks complex health issues considered human trial sample populations. 



To suggest *should* tell fibs health risks cements distrust. bad enough there's reasonable assumption profit motive so, selfish consumer motive encourages lack transparency further. ‘Covid party’?!? … mind-bogglingly foolish. legit angry stupid people are. living cave last two years? Covid deadly!

And without watching video I’m going go limb guess weren’t vaccinated “chemicals” whatever. many kids died COVID states again?

How many kids gone school, got covid came home killed family members important question, sociopathic sympathizer. whole reason COVID's kicking asses infectious asymptomatic?   guy making BUCKETS money offering Covid treatment centers since owns stock companies making monoclonal antibodies- way EUA Harvard Total Landscaping know asymptomatic cases spread. know people asymptomatic positive infections infectious. 

My classroom revolving door covid right now. I’ve dozens cases classroom far school year. got another email student covid couple hours ago. see 200 kids per day classroom, couple masking. draw infection zones seating charts.

Quarantines close covid exposure help keep students school staff safer. reduces spread. 

The flippant way you’re talking 480 dead children crazy. certainly didn’t deserve die, even could save ONE something ignorant like letting sick kids attend school, would worth it. children. Human beings. 

I’d also like point children aren’t one building. Five teachers already caught covid. feel like it’s matter time catch again. janitors, principals, teachers, aides, secretaries. adults, young old, absolutely get sick die crazy pandemic. stuff killing us. 

Covid taking visible toll us. Teachers quitting flat out, substitute teachers nonexistent, teachers left behind stretched thinner thinner. us forced 6/5 contracts (no prep extra classes), preps eaten go stand another teacher’s room teach kids they’re home covid.

We lost another teacher today. walked halfway day didn’t come back. She’s done. She’s third teacher department quit year. Showing teachers don’t value lives health great way lose teachers, tell flat-out kind turnover hurting student achievement far student staying home they’re exposed covid.

I want make something clear - “exposure” we’re talking typically substantial ongoing. state made mandatory exposure quarantines illegal, several students come parents siblings home active positive covid infections. One classroom three days finally started showing symptoms. I’ve got six students class sick - corner room. gave covid.

They probably won’t die. they’re lucky, parents might saddled tens thousands dollars medical bills… wishful thinking best. 

I’ll tell what. Instead sitting flippant dead kids, maybe join honorable profession. desperately need teachers subs. Come sit infection hub show us it’s done. We're living crazy world.  time alive.  Fucks sake. border shut years. 90% high threshold. (cough cough)

""You're asymptomatic, fine. Get house, gotta go work."" time lost wait people able get third dose.

You close choice.

If someone tested positive, contacts quarantine law.

If ignore it, heavy fines incomming Oh, God. would hurt. 66.1% US population aged 18 older fully vaccinated.  Vaccine fully available adults 5 months.

Denmark, you’re vaccinated close contact someone COVID, don’t quarantine, however, recommended get tested day 4 believe. It’s working fine far, don’t see reason shouldn’t work Germany. live Alabama. Sadly, move needle here. Idk, heard couple people get Hawaii they're facing pretty hefty fines now. I'm sure vaccination required people end taking it, forging vaccination record actually crime. Ireland coped stupid rule case gone since school open summer Pfizer's dose 30 units (micgorgrams, we'll ignore part going forward).

Mordera's dose 100.

A 2-dose regimen moderna (200 units) significantly effective 2-dose regimen pfizer (60 units).

A 3-dose regimen pfizer (90 units) even effective. Dosing 2 people 180 units, still less (you dose people) dosing single person 2 moderna doses.

The vaccines considered essentially identical dose size. [This video ex CIA showing tell someone lying. post see something officer said look for.   can't believe pricey Utah become. dont make sense, less dose give person, extra doses given donated others, extra third dose could donated elsewhere get whole world vaccinated quicker rather spending 3 doses achieve similar protection. faster everyone world get vacicnated, less mutation happen. Remember delta mutated India, would happen get vaccinated quickly. going saddest Christmas ever children's hospitals.

Let's start saving pennies buy kids shitload video game consoles make it.  ""MD"" part kills me. Why? believe this? keep questioning know. can't informed doctor. So, motivate change position FUCKING STUPID. God, fucking WHY? curiosity, many deaths influenza cause year? point say death count acceptable? Difficult decisions make. 

Canada saw recent bump cases opened borders US. However, already semi open travel countries maybe best example use. see many folks comment Desantis idiot. wish idiot. scary truth he’s incredibly well educated highly calculated would sell anyone everyone benefit. 100% he’s sociopath. forever grift continues … Thanks. 

Another way look crudely divide 450/4,600,000= .0097%. 

And keep mind I’ve seen recorded estimates high 5.5m. mind studies show undercounting bad 5x 10x, meaning likely case count probably 5x recorded minimum. Kids also likely pretty mild cases going untested. 

That could mean mean CFR low .001% even .0008%. IFR funky like that. 

But yes. Highest risk nowhere near .2%. Invest retirement funds Regeneron companies make respiratory therapy equipment. seniors Taiwan waited 8 weeks second shot Moderna, none sight.

Taiwan’s vaccine rollout haphazard, partly seems government trying wall wait pandemic caught guard Delta variant hit country anyway, despite best efforts.  sympathy  means he's overqualified job Florida. Better! Upstairs community college booster third shot? Brian Kemp belatedly learned last July asymptomatic people still spread virus, we’re back shell game, huh? Damn. asking practice preach.

That kind thing happened, wasn’t widespread. time smoking bans came about, percentage smokers getting pretty low. fairly good chunk smokers either little ashamed habit considerate enough get it. 

Also, change gradual 20 years-ish helped. Bars last domino. Offices, stores restaurants gradually couple decades think smokers half brain saw coming. grumbly it, generally didn’t throw shitfits. No. experts believe taking it? Tell kid know coughtnit Feb last year carry inhaler damage lungs. COVID die like that?

It burns out, running human fuel. now... Selection lethality happens sizable portion population died. selection lethality that. I’ve olfactory training kids covid three weeks ago it’s working!

Forgot add twice daily.  even surprised Trumps VP '24 Putin drag. deep-fried (insert food) crap, fried oreos legit. Gotta eat hot, tho!  Tastes like road apples accomplish that?

You said something profoundly stupid called it. OP btw. That's fair, can't speak politics Netherlands, apologize assuming talking US Government. try assume one got away me. 

It's surprising hear large percentage youth Netherlands anti-vax. Though, quotes provided could taken video rural Americans talking Covid vaccine. Like arguments made US full half truths and/or completely lack big picture understanding position. frustrating far reaching misinformation virus been. talking vaccines? vaccines, experimental gen therapy. Side effects dangerous virus""

This quote example blatantly wrong. 100% percentage thing counts, get covid also gain immunity. non- vaccinated get little bit sick we're immune. sort out.""

... quote lacks perspective. ignores decision get vaccinated put others risk virus, emergency cannot properly taken care unvaxxed hospitals. 

Personally, come conclusion many unvaxxed essentially become part cult like cults try convince otherwise get entrenched cult. Please, willing bet anyone submissive relationship would Trump  need slander look bad, activly murderers. 2021 they're back donating massive sums 'gay conversion' (read:torture) therapy, funded ""homosexuality punishable death"" law passed several African countries recently.

Necessary vaccine mandates, yes. change position “pro-vaccine/anti-mandate” “pro-vaccine/pro-mandate” legitimate reasoning so. think accepting fact Covid19 much airborne admitted.

I think admitting --- scientists doctors accept anything unless overwhelming evidence presented peer reviewed journal. Even then, many continue believe want. wait till discos opened people longer show vaccination certificates restaurants.

That's point I'm bringing comments. come family intelligent minds

This satire comment... right?  latest claim hear anti-vaxxers vaccinated folks spread virus rate unvaccinated folks. true? sooner later parents suing parents endangering kids.

FTFY And, yikes side things, long storied history cops barge tenements force-vaccinate everyone Smallpox, regard consent whether even understood enough English know fuck going on.

You tell something American make something universal good human rights violation smh. discounting hypocrisy, know anecdote equate rules; elementary school uses 3ft, kids wear masks, lunch/recess/after school program, none faculty staff honestly ensuring physical distancing; kids practically other's faces lot time. school also started weekly pooled testing (only 50% families opted though), school session 4 weeks cases covid-19 reported yet. Note, live high vaccination rate county, faculty staff vaccinated well.

However, plenty kids stayed home days cold (ours included, got tested, negative COVID-19). makes us think precautions COVID-19 effective be, since precautions also prevent kids catching colds well, we're mostly spared relatively high vaccination rate area. air purifiers going windows/doors open fans running rooms, try much outdoors possible, probably helps.

When starting school again, district planned in-person learning. able sort hybrid independent study anyway jobs. one planned anything going back things usual.

The frustrating thing months plan; money made available school districts bring faculty, bring portable rooms, smaller groups space, make resources available--classrooms ask donations buy air purifiers, filters, fans. Makes sense since normal circumstances school district horribly underpays teachers staff, much less organizing handle pandemic circumstances. isn’t ok judge say based aren’t trusting experts ? please stop hypocrites !

So, trust experts, never check see someone expert in…? You’re willfully stupid, I’ll answer one time anyone else actually curious.

You asked massive push covid vaccination, similar yearly push flu vaccine. It’s covid worse typical seasonal flu. help illustrate fact, compared covid worst flu could think of.

This also answers disingenuous question don’t (comparatively) panic incorrect flu vaccine guesses. Garbage company benefits.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* [Here Miami Herald explaining why.

A months ago DeSantis gremlins decided report deaths differently way anywhere else reports (which - surprise! - happens make things look better casual observer).

In places, hospitals local health departments report Covid deaths state, state reports number day. That’s it.

It gives pretty good idea overall trajectory, even deaths may taken week two reported whatever bureaucracy/lag.

DeSantis figured capitalize reporting lag -

Every day, Florida reports deaths confirmed actually happened exact day. usually single low double digits.

Then take 200-400 deaths reported localities hospitals add graph day actually occurred - usually 1-3 weeks earlier.

This effect ALWAYS making recent 2 week period look like deaths plummeting well.

DeSantis knows people occasionally glance chart like see good news - casual observers check back often enough realize days thought looked promising “back filled” peak shifted ahead, illusionary drop also shifted ahead filled later date…

It’s fucked up. I'm definitely waiting booster. half dose works equally well may cause bad reaction since less going in. going go court,

but got high... ok

Yes Judge. Lari-Fari gave OK. Final Solution. Yes Judge. following orders. 85% actually, 86% one dose 80% fully vaccinated hope reach 85% end month.

Honestly, looking numbers, results promising, specially vaccinating younger generations (12+) we've several massive gatherings thousands people last months numbers raise. whole summer relaxed rules numbers go up. beginning steadily rising numbers, government thinking lock decided start vaccinating younger generations afterwards numbers plateaued started slowly going since.

So, looking 10M people country, 70% specially bellow 30 years started vaccinated? Things got progressively better, even though 100% delta cases.

Is clear cut win? No. makes disease manageable whole point think. cases deaths currently lower flu strains. So, treatment released, vaccination seems way go. Yeah going lockdown minimum 7 weeks, looks likely extended. prediction 10-12 weeks end. Imperial College London researching disease could reprogramming immune system, similar way illnesses.

The learn covid, I'm horrified. would like constellation. Let leave planet Texas Florida. It’s always two trouble makers making news isn’t number. Herd immunity longer achieved delta variant spread, regardless many get infected recover. far transmissible, recovered get reinfected again. X ok damn high! monster!! far results seem promising, started removing restrictions gradually July, summer immense number cases people partying ignoring restrictions regarding groups, government vaccination task force (realizing never convince people stop that) doubled efforts vaccinate younger generations numbers going slowly steadily less half people hospitalized beginning summer much tighter control social distancing measures place.

Of course disease still around several outbreaks elderly centers, deaths, happened last year beginning year although delta delta (100% cases) deaths nowhere near comparable.

We past month huge number gatherings thousands people, like 2019, numbers go now, think safe unless new even worse strain pops up. People get govt deserve.

I've seen many leaders *declare* stuff pandemic area foundation epidemiology. half public filtering statements wishful thinking dismiss whole thing 'over'. Based current known variants. new one show though, like delta did. Everything vaccine.... Yeah ghetto screenshots random day selected last month first said 6 deaths. whenever remembered I’d check screenshot date again. it’s going dramatically ever since first screenshot. 

I know early weird backdating deaths always looks like it’s going look present.

Mind you. understand reporting takes time. observation weirdness. ""yet"" implies yet happen. think studies minors many countries stopped using AZ younger people/completely SVT/palletes issues. Genuine thank patience posting. Pretty similar story Britain killing vaccination rates (zoomers too!). wrong. say matter weeks, said contingent upon continues right now.

It turned level strong taper differs much countries and, view, unexpected way. Germany much lower level expected, Portugal unexpectedly high limit, 88% total population least one dose right now!. Portugal shows 90% range crazy good communication. reason reach 90% countries like NZ people stupid, lack vaccination ability.

Where ends also policy regarding children. native Sweden seeing tapering now, 83% 16+ (70% total pop). November start vaccination 12-15 year olds, give us boost upwards. sure vaccinating younger kids NZ. parties US. Doesn’t Canada really good education system? Canadians always tell that. get serologic test eligible, though accuracy interpretation results limited afaik. Needless say, handwashing, masking social distancing whenever possible. depended state. California, college instructors staff included teachers/school staff. rules say civil, I’m going comment insinuation would care daughter adverse reaction. Instead, I’ll say this: I’ve looked data. I’ve looked trials they’ve already done children 17 5. percentages reactions different adults billions people vaccinated minor reactions. make nervous general? course does. benefits outweigh risks 1000 fold. fact don’t see tells that, like lot people, you’re bad long-term risk assessment comparing two probabilities. Yes. Problem: contact tracing partly collapsing/ done...

I´d propose mandatory tests vaccinated work (like schools).  Man Portugal crushing it. thought Spain well reason vaccine rate really slowed down. 

Here it’s young hesitating. sure why.

But even 80% least 1 shot seeing drastic decline. hope maybe introduce rules require vaccine enter indoor bars restaurants. talk walk. University Colorado Boulder massive COVID outbreak last year tried person learning without adequate protection. Consequences: 

- Mostly virtual learning November 2020 Summer 2021
- angry students, staff, townspeople 
- President Mark Kennedy ousted

Hot wars really way future, we're absolutely cyber/info war right - we're losing, badly. right gave upvote. still change mind decision individual. Vaccinate can, educate much possible, leave rest fend themselves. Canada similar vaccination rate Denmark even lower population density, hospitals well buckling pressure. hope Denmark outcome.   Horse hot dogs loaded extra ivermectin. Im already dead inside FL  Great. Glad got there.    apologize!    don’t call people man. Show tolerance. I...... Sigh





I think something wrong girl called girl not.


Man imply annoyance say hey, dude. supreme court concerned public health safety ensuring negative liberty like court is. good lmao. actually starts happen, I'm curious seeing anti-vaxxers try defend stance ruled unconstitutional put others danger. thread Florida doctor vaccines. Please take pronoun obsession elsewhere. reason ""I got first dose 4 months ago, still get second dose?"" questions nearly every day. Public messaging really needs better: miss second dose get time it'll even better due delay. pity neighbor states Sounds fucking fire me. **SO** nice stink got home. locked 3 months straight - watching northern hemisphere festival footage 

I feel you. Southeast Asia reporting in. think wish this, supreme court packed hogs expect give damn public health.  EVERYTHING right, including regular Hartley first suspected COVID-19 became winded walking staircase Harding Fine Arts. Normally, he’s fit healthy, biked 1,000 miles around Lake Hefner summer. 

I want order box N95s. That's probably additional thing do.  He's everything regarding health. He's kept kidney going 10 years pretty good. Also Hartley first suspected COVID-19 became winded walking staircase Harding Fine Arts. *Normally, he’s fit healthy, biked 1,000 miles around Lake Hefner summer.* 

Which nothing kidney transplant recipient. Yeah. people HCA posting ""oh life busy know, hard find time, made appointment ran day 3 months car broke and...""

If can't get vaccine shot US point really want one, must hours town means transportation.  Idk people manage need get court pay fee get visa fishing license. like guy CDC told Rick Grimes. infected. 
I think come point all. be.
And once. 
We might succeeded stopping spread could died 3 core things prevented this.
1. Vaccine distribution
2. People vaccines
3. Poor leadership.

It really makes blood boil knowing addition heart disease, cancer numerous ailments, covid could prevented, are.  Exactly excuses point. saying survey. Vaccine makers need get ahead start variant version vaccines. least rest us fine. ACIP gives approval boosters today, able get mine later today tomorrow (healthcare worker). There's testing vaccination site that's 15 minute walk live waiting final approval. Exactly. It’s disrespectful think there’s something wrong girl. again, would someone calls people “man” ever tolerant?   I'm sorry. read differently meant. thought comparing ban anti vaxxers service animals smoking. Like ""Well animals harm someone smoking causes cancer secondhand smoke.."". I'm sorry. 

I would think it'd mandated show proof sort. restrictions like unvaccinated wednesdays something.  Anyone know happened AMA posted last night? People asking good questions find now. beginning said disrespectful? People high risk think seriously becoming vaccinated knowing low risk population likely won’t change stance severity COVID isn’t enough them. Yall still taste things?   :( I'm happy Portugal.

It's hard reading successful countries live shithole known United States America. test anywhere else world (12-13 times Canada, per capita), hopefully kind increase would problematic spotted time act it, becomes problem hospitals.

It's stupidly expensive tests, big part reason open without (so far) major problems.  See? That’s tolerant all.  :) Really? Wear mask don’t spread covid people. Wear condom don’t spread stds people. Pretty cut dry seems me.. SIGHHH....... think that. called girl male disrespectful. college educated wite woman. Damn hardly surprising news one hint legal education bothered Google constitutional issue five minutes. good law USA damn century now.     Sure shit did. can’t believe allowed smoking planes. couldn’t imagine sucking peoples smoke entire flight. hard optimize two things once.  part right get vaccinated right participate society difficult part?. 

Immunity covid get clear leaning towards true. Plus proof covid prove whether got vaccine, go get vaccine. Even there's 25 players hockey team losing still significant course long tournament.

Leaving someone home matters well would weigh possible risk losing multiple players. case ice hockey though particular rules Canada put forth would suspect nearly every NHL player going vaccinated regardless Home Country. heard Russian Federation major leagues might doing.

The rule book looking Google search Olympic ice hockey roster rules.

But think point made good one person's goal avoid ever somebody else's close contact right unvaccinated, would true professional athletes also regular workers jobs would put shelf 2 weeks close contact

So even means training hours wearing mask whatever might be, they've working hard many years Olympics there's reason risk losing someone else's fault. I’m fence forced quarantines. obviously think that, COVID standpoint, great idea. But, considering fact kids 12 can’t get vaccine also young stay home alone… footing bill parents miss two weeks work? Every time child gets exposed? It’ll surely happen often they’re going school person.

As someone self employed, simply would able afford sacrifice 2 weeks income every time hypothetical child exposed. don’t get PTO. can’t work home. I’d go broke. Literally would car repossessed, default credit card payments, would trouble buying groceries, would disaster. Would spiral homelessness quickly. Don’t really care kind someone thinks two sides everything called girl disrespectful. :) ban smoking everywhere know least three people Covid earlier last winter got 1 doze Pfizer summer booster infection acquired immunity. view, infection acquired immunity plus one dose already strong enough protection didn’t need get second dose. would real kind you. specifically spoke middle ground. know care, still struggle get past habit using he/she. long genuinely try, see issue that. However someone knows issue, bother changing want to, that's I'd call dick   Republicans side Russians North Koreans, they've since least Trump campaign began.

If CoviD come China, they'd still raging supporters China President Winnie Xi Pooh, much Trump admired figuring change law remain President life.  That's awesome! really hope sets domino effect cities. age range pretty low vaccination rates bump would make *big* difference boosting herd immunity...especially trickles K up, vaccines approved.  Yes, world different place now. Last year, high case rates many things closed, large events, schools, businesses, well restricted international travel. Today, high case rates (but stabilizing even dropping places) vaccines, everything pretty much open (at least U.S.) progress.   boycotting Olympics begin withb ironically, old reddit used bastion expertise knowledge sharing. now, post 2016 Trump, full misinformation bots 13 year old edgelords, conservatives reject information would care kind day have?    not? submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* FFS Alberta. Get grip. fry dr. Pepper 🧐 you. George Washington ordered it. Even human trafficker 250+ years ago knew benefit vaccination. Seattle get serious Covid cases Washington State Idaho (and perhaps Montana?)...seems like they'll wind Crisis Mode Care level service sooner rather later rate. least 2 people successfully treated.

Details research paper called ""Successful beef desensitization 2 adult patients delayed-type reaction red meat"" Derya Unal MD, et al. Sure thing.
 
Good day he's given source, lame response?

Here's neat trick try. somebody makes claim feel dubious, head sand long time, Google claim see come reliable sources. 

Then need constantly asking sources. 

I imagine told put man moon coming back with, ""Uh. Sources?""   lot ducks FL makes sense. What?

I'm confused relates question. asking since federal court views unconstitutional anti-vaxxers put others risk, places business actually start able ban people vaccinated? 

I used no-smoking no-pets examples, smoking can't enter certain area, animal can't enter certain area (with exception service dogs help disabled people)

So way would work vaccine mandates general public would be: unvaccinated(maybe vaccine passports could actually introduced?), can't enter certain area. 

In simpler terms, I'm asking means types public private areas/businesses start enforcing people vaccinated want enter area. understand point comment think trying do. like banning people allowed vaccinated public spaces policy 

Public policy supposed protect body public. What's issue it? Yay!! Good luck! think ever end covid policy US, you’re crazy. watch winter everything closed again. basis seem belief foregone conclusion boosters mean detracting getting first two?  forget countries low vaccination rates old people. think 70 million people subsaharan Africa older 60.

So even vaccinating 10% population massive impact. Good see this. One disappointing things last 18 months lack revolution testing/detection (and wearable effective masks)

Hope makes mainstream usage. Sure is. willing expose kids it'll bring money. They’re embalming bodies waiting line cremation even bodies aren’t open casket embalmed bodies don’t need refrigerated. real answer eat hate yourself.

I making first place already though also shows “hospitals lose workers vaccine mandate” doesn’t look side “healthcare workers burn soon don’t get Covid control.” produce varied responses vaccination too. matters, populations, aggregate. aggregate natural infection produces solid immunity.

Solid fuzzy term. I'm saying sterilizing. immunity beneficial exposed again. Damn, hope feel better. lucky like 18hrs mild flu symptoms.  U wanna jeep 30 days? We’re still level 3 lockdown Auckland, gatherings hospitality, click collect retail, schools closed, many WFH. 80% 12 least one shot vaccine. That’s plus side.

Against us it’s got low income Pasifika community it’s common 10 12 people live single house, one catches do. It’s also got gangs, one last cases prisoner paroled caught stopping pick drugs way home.

So it’s balance. Dumb question maybe know answer—what “Id.” mean written ends passages ib judgements like this? appt next Wednesday! stupid shitheads try anything, long vaccine  problem! Hope get soon! despise men like this. I'm male. One time accidentally stepped guys shoe crowded bar guy sucker punched face HARD hurt LOT. remember felt that. traumatic never thought someone would react violently something innocent. therapy martial arts classes able get fear control. imagine nurse feels right now. I'm actually tearing thinking it. find guy, book thrown him. Lock throw away key.  Misinformation. comparing apples oranges.

.0021% adolescents country hospitalized positive COVID diagnosis worst week pandemic.

.04% study group vaccinated adolescents hospitalized reason week vaccine dose. discuss downthread. 

Tldr: smart never close contact. link this? Seems interesting. kind dangerous side effects experience?  Old people frail last couple years. Especially bedridden. dangerous misinformation spread control, could government execute spreaders? 

(/s) That’s false. People produce widely varied immune responses infection.  Well, gerrymandered hell state, going even harder dig hole. isn’t news. one ever made claim amount shots 100% effective. mathematical certainty Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol  doesn’t matter whether you’re vaccinated not, fwiw. aren’t discussing vax status. 

And federal mandate? disagree with, exactly? don’t apologize rant.

These people care you, family, neighbours, elderly, babies, kids, school kids, immunocompromised people, organ transplant recipients, cancer patients, teachers, doctors, nurses, healthcare workers, pilots, flight staff, etc.

They care - sometimes even children. Ye member, im something real important expect late reply 😘 natural infection produces solid immunity. (If formerly infected still get vaccinated. many people wrongly believe covid symptoms match cold had. covid plus vaccination better anyway.).  Every Pandemic ended. doesn’t mean COVID cases. It’s means become endemic. learn live it, much like we’re living now. want make guarantees, go ahead. I’m sure understand logic here, fwiw.

I'm saying unlikely lose entire teams due covid case two.

Also, America still goes play basketball even though sending best players. ""suvs"" there. Even you’re able read research understanding/comprehending means skill need learn. 

The root issue people lack education unwillingness learn more/new information. 

So basically isn’t lack research, it’s abundance narcissistic ignorance Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol feel like going kick another wave reckless behavior. brains turn mush 50 world run old people, everything fucked? Yeah remember... Felt like decade ago, realized love lolol. Yeah reddit prob like words male female sentences something. meant entire world. developed world it’s probably winter vaccine resistance variant doesn’t come. many shots close together likely cause problematic side effects. 

People Moderna's trial got 250ug shot (normal 100ug) large number bad side effects dangerous ones stopped group give 2nd (their antibody levels nearly high others 2, still protected). would doubt natural immunity better effectiveness, robust immunity attack parts virus spike likely less effectiveness strength response would likely worse. variants, unless see spike protein mutation, certainly good attacking spike. 100% know yet, either way get vaccinated. ""natural immunity"" even better immunity vaccines natural immunity. So, end, excuse get vaccinated. Also, can't really prove strength natural immunity well evaluating antibodies spike vaccine. certainly looking t-cell repertoires expensive assays run difficult interpret. educated guess would best situation could natural immunity + vaccine, vaccine like J&amp;J Moderna well after, something really offering, really instance new strain new spike arises. recent vaccinated boosters necessary, still lot people cannot get vaccinated young eligible. Willfully unvaccinated also driving worst countries made vaccines easily available. Many areas world simply cannot get reliable access.

So combination prohibiting conditions, poor logistics, really REALLY dumb behavior going keep spread alive years come unfortunately.

It'll feel like cold vaccinated. many not, susceptible, painful sometimes deadly disease far worse flu  Seattle currently still plenty capacity account city taking COVID seriously (case rates county currently 1/6th Alaska's rate per NY Times data), yeah, lot people local subreddits happy idea.     Thank you. Even poorest EU nations got access mRNA vaccines countries. end Romania Bulgaria sold part doses. know, write like sudden thought, possible said excuse violent vaccination location? thinking would make harder track down- don’t know sure truth is, it’s yelling. Don’t know sure wife vaccinated day. Hell could lying even wife. I’m still worried, offering reason might easy location fast answer.  That's mandates treading freedom.

This whole pandemic used excuse justify overreach abuse power. Democrats said get vaccine Trump requiring it, Republicans thing. California, governor states Thanksgiving 3 families gather together longer 2 hours masked goes French Laundry dinner 5 couples masks.

We would whole lot better politicians shut quit stupid mandates half people trust take seriously due hypocrisy. would much easier get people vaccinate felt decision mandates take away possibility. Cue communities becoming even bigger shitholes 3-5 years, regular measles + monkey pox outbreaks can't bothered anything it. 

Some find way blame people become even bigger denialists. nice never run anyone involved acrimonious relationship ex happen. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol unacceptable kill someone gun acceptable COVID? Yeah remember... Felt like decade ago, realized love lolol. Yeah reddit prob like words male female sentences something.  Keep fallacious arguements like slippery slope conversations already full misinformation, part problem. one suggesting execute infected, requirement wear mask, get vaccinated. introduce pointless nonsense. happens, come back tell told so. then, keep useless fallacies Yeah hate it. hate abuse relationships. getting better women abusing men mentally too. Like...can love relationship work separate instead abusing other. Can't get along. Sadly people a-holes like guy. Sounds like good time blast America Fuck yeah Bo Burnham statement song form would love ask them, 
“So, what’s first step creating vaccine?”
“What’s first chemical purchase?”
“What’s name computer program would use start process vaccine design?”

After lols….

So janitor lab,
“What use clean lab?”: Bleach, UV injected body, hydroclorocline, OTHER?”

Ans: literally don’t know first thing vaccines, aren’t fit janitor vaccine laboratory. lol counts medical condition  subs don´t help players put quarantine Well someone child's mother, medical procedure vaccine contagious virus, probably nothing cause treat kids like property reports, requests vaccine shot popular last request so-called anti-vaxxers intubated /s Yes do. seem vaping openly ""no smoking"" areas they've conveniently decided ""vaping"" technically ""smoking"" none rules apply new version bystander-poisoning habit.  That's nuts. idea would done shoes, someone came obnoxiously would played ""not want it"" point basically making beg it. 

Nobody forcing you. Go get another job want to. Clearly shot. like going Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol help mind  Yeah see point. country didnt let get vaxed got infected lol. straight went got first Moderna dose, antivaxers dont want shot said.

However, would wise follow science. guess third dose would hurt risk rare side effect (for example myocarditis, especially male) could actually bigger benefit vaccine get fourth dose less 6 months example. Unfortunately, cases like these, wife probably already beaten decided go nurse. abused women usually repressed/manipulated literally feel like place go. It’s sad. Alpha pandemic then, still over. course, knew early June Delta pandemic getting started, pretty dumb continue writing Alpha. change Alpha pandemic ended months ago. asked could handle it... sounds... much me. good know Sarah Palin’s death panel. I'm vaccinated, endangering are? Thank you! Fk every last one u moron antivax c#nts second flu prediction jives better break infection stories. people talk upper respiratory symptoms, many talk malaise fatigue. sort thing go work with, even *that guy* damn tired.

But maybe vaccination infection it'll mostly upper respiratory thing.

All 2 cents, case someone thought claiming omniscience. Stop making sound inconvenient. lines.

Well, boosters, lines months. Unfortunately immunosuppressive drugs incredibly expensive likely needed insurance help cover cost drugs.

My husband kidney transplant calculated cost used Costco without insurance coverage would $450/month compared $130 every 3 months pay insurance.

Tbh article good news considering husband works high risk job much younger. least man survived bc probably wouldn’t didn’t get third dose. Unfortunately, nonsense portion always boring I’m out. I’ll copy/pasting out. See ya! Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol Yeah, property underwater 40 years though.  🎸🎵⚡🎸⚡🎵🎸🎵⚡ Well played u/Butthole--pleasures. No. can’t see Supreme Court ever making argument. Forced vaccinations would implemented first prior execution citizens. Basically, remedies would need exhausted first. hypothetical, people infected sufficiently lethal contagious pathogen pose question. unvaxxed care find ways make easier make less afraid. Washington ton mobile ""clinics"", often tent sidewalk hospital van parked front.

Such clinics new state, Seattle often offer basic medical services homeless people buildings lot people can't get doctor easily. They've also served illegal immigrants here, yes, decent population well.

I often wonder states well? medicine treated much like industry? ...Someone, likely Republican wanting earn brownie points, politicize effort, making common goal bad thing.

On hand, difficulty imagining many people (of political affiliation) rolling dice loved ones vaccine levies 5-10% mortality rate, name fellow man (whom, judging sorts comments read daily thread elsewhere, spend much time disparaging).

EDIT: record-time downvote, dude. We’re process dying, covid accelerates process many people. People respect fragility human body, think they’re superheroes live America time plenty cherry-pick sentence from
a non peer-reviewed draft instead actually reading published study linked? people go one shot change minds getting second one. Right, spreading covid *more strongly* punished, require consent victim, whereas sexual contact unconsenting person already illegal. Agreed worst hellhole Canada offer

Are Canadians provide information particular place? what's relevance comment commented on? discussion compulsory vaccination.

Why interjecting non relevant question executing infected? 

The footnote constitution address that. relevant here. Bringing irrelevant shit discredit make something look less creditable (the constitution) straw man. Cause mutation exist that’s trolling. seen unfolded last year half know there’s ramp anymore. 
The vaccines literally protect becoming infected. Therefore, also reduces risk transmission. cannot transmit something don’t have. read fauci said hit 80-85 percent start see spread slow. example Ontario think we're 80 percent first dose maybe even second we're starting see cases plateau even drop delta variant even though predicting things stert rising school started. two weeks far we're holding pretty steady even though everyone kept trying cases continue rise Google Alberta, Canada. dropped restrictions July 1st ICU’s approaching 200% maximum capacity. 

It didn’t help matters 172 beds 4.5 million people.    younger people, isn’t better cold? Considering vast majority asymptomatic, next common thing light symptoms like runny nose cough, sounds like better common cold. Neither drug companies. Make liable, talk Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol literally never felt fluid vaccine. get flu shot every year plus got tetanus booster years ago.  Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol takes away people actually. Hard go around polite saying thank ma’am thank sir worry someone feels today. Simply taking away simple thank sir/ma’am take away two people feeling better. wants say thank ma’am get corrected whateverthefucktheyaretoday. Takes away kindness people give receive someone take different extreme. wanna “they” well thing “they” pain ass fucking normal people. Niceties go away BS. 9-6 yes number 3 equivalent argument, worth addressing. guess makes sense - hot air rises. could prevented? would continued live animals, come back again. started, 0 chance stopping good. People vaccines means nothing live animals can’t vaccinate. comes time - got shot. nurses giving shot really good giving shots - didnt feel it. Bring beer deal! using actual soap like bar soap? sounds like soap residue possibly left behind definitely make smell. Try liquid soap mild body wash something. 

You supposed replace cloth masks months. washing whatnot damages fibers they’re much job filtering. 

I’m vaccinated don’t think it’s worth use kn95s, etc others suggesting. use surgical masks. you’re unvaccinated reason, def use something better cloth. coming zombie bite party? LOL, stay home scared!! /s Maybe one day America get there.

Congrats Ireland citizens. 40% us 40% NYC. NYC could 0% places bad policy higher make it.

I doubt they're telling truth well basic math still *Inadvertent Minority Report references* think controls another grown adult? Ok, relevant comment replied isn’t related? March-May want vaccine job requires it? Get different job. lie though? would gain story vs showing hitting people? Vaccine mandates state level. states rights issue. case law federally mandated vaccines. issue government proposing that. also second lowest hospitalization country. almost Maoist thanks. mentioned available urban areas northeast, rates still low. 

The Bronx lowest rate NYC. can’t tell straight face 40% unvaccinated people can’t find way hospital, doctor’s office, redi clinic, pharmacy. pop vaccine clinics everywhere, vaccine buses. setting vaccine pop ups Section 8 housing. city done EVERYTHING try get vaccine rate borough acceptable level, it’s going snail’s pace. penalty violating repeated punches nurse's face. irony runs deep. Actually topic judicial scrutiny substantive due process claim. mean article published serious legal blog, medical journal like. Hey go r/louderwithcrowder. saying thay liberals advocating genocide unvaccinated. aren’t arguing smart people horse fetish sub? believe God, picking virus seeing afterlife would address request. Another covid caren. unvaxxed ass fun jail kind violence absolutely tolerated. person get maximum sentence worst hellhole Canada offer. 

Anybody thinks wife needs husbands 'permission get vaccine got serious issues. Anybody would walk pharmacy attack woman giving vaccine terrible human being. clear indication first time put hands woman.   I'm well aware that. So, I'm vaxxed (and thus protected getting severely sick, yay), unvaxxed endangering me? I’ve yelled one hotel person assigned “non-smoking room” really smoking room sprayed febreeze in. much issue breakthrough cases among vaccinated? especially silly considering that's concept behind vaccines, except get damn virus No. rely mercenaries billionaires mercenary companies (blackrock) get richer govt contracts. 

The army could simply make basic training year long instead 6 weeks start dieting walking work way too. Indeed, also smoke free 5 years WI still complaining may follow similar rule. ""But border WI, business booming. business losing customers tobacco ban.""

Here's WI bitching moaning may follow law MN residents following 5 WONT THINK POOR CAPITALISTS!? Also yes 50-64 underlying medical conditions.

Votes 18-49 underlying medical conditions happening right now.

Vote 18-64 high risk occupations right that.  vaccine stop getting virus spreading, helps protect getting severely sick.  Boosters coming. I’ll innline soon they’re ready Meal Team Six.  fucking great!! yeah 2 hours writing comment wife asks work rest day, went go take COVID test well.

Hooray. Yes are. vaccine stop getting covid passing along others. helps protect getting severely sick point hospitalization needed. Plus anti-vaxxers gives virus opportunity mutate something vaccines effective against. yeah, anti-vaxxers endangering everyone else. Doesn’t Massachusetts great vaccination rate too? pretty worrisome Hi, see think made slippery slope argument really argument matter.

The second part post point example constitutional question actually answered law.

Do think scenario impossible? don't. consent

It's body wtf NIAID already running slippery slope argument all. argument all.

It's Constitutional question remains unanswered.   would anyone make **that gamble** mandates would help solve problem everyone. … **Including vaccinated folks.**

Huh?

What's gamble exactly made vaccinated athletes?

Because choice vaccine mandate last time around.

Seems like lost thread talking something completely different. Probably willing admit wrong poster assumnig everyone tested positive COVID made choice unvaccinated. Except safe we're effing dumb  way guy beat wife. Almost nobody supports hitting woman, hitting woman that's stranger giving wife vaccine indicative character trait, one time mistake. See also: drunk drivers hell even lines anymore? could drive clinic hit ya blow dart gun point! Ya, guess see. Hopefully states what's right fed gov doesnt step Complete piece shit. hope nurses man found douche beat ass. long enemies brown tell Republicans enlist shoot them, usa fine  whoever downvoted, hope create vaccine cure delusions future. Although I'm sure take that, either. 24 deaths total using range measures, including two levels lockdown, higher used twice. modelling looking vaccination measures. HowAboutNo.gif also ~2.5x likely reinfected vaccinated

That even make logical sense study says opposite true study demonstrated natural immunity confers longer lasting stronger protection infection, symptomatic disease hospitalization caused Delta variant SARS-CoV-2, compared BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. biggest factor see federal government authorized emergency use vaccine still hasn’t cleared full FDA trials. Therefor individual rights decide themselves. clears full FDA, mandated upheld states. what? they're gonna.  Wow almost like common knowledge everyone except anti-vaxxers. people already turned mindless zombies virus known republicanism long covid existed. Well shit understand hesitancy allowing boosters people jobs put contact general public would basically open boosters practically anyone, I've disappointed allow boosters healthcare workers providing direct care known COVID patients. say immunocompromised. check. ""once kids get vaccine"" - that's several months now

""unwilling protect vulnerable workers booster"" - approved criteria cover 60% population

besides : ""The FDA indicated people whose jobs put extra risk infection would also eligble.  
This group may include health care workers, teachers day care staff, grocery workers homeless shelters prisons, ""among others,"" said acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock statement released Wednesday. ""

from USA today article today confusing me, I’m trouble understanding differences FDA CDC recommendations. healthcare workers get Pfizer booster not? (Assuming received doses Pfizer vaccine 6+ months ago)? Salary. think anyone gets hourly. fat kill around you.  Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol Life must've kind hopefully. Yeah died. mean smoke I’m fuckin glad can’t smoke indoors. Shits gross fuck submission removed because

Lolol know consider ""high risk"" assessment changed all? expect poster exact quote 20 hour two day meeting? Watch/listen next time want exact quotes. Judging downvote probably relate all. He's going learn injected without consent soon enough... Yep, instead seeing obvious example choice get vaccinated impact others  Yup absolutely ridiculous explicitly consider anything less hospitalized. issue vaccinated people spreading high risk groups lacking protection severe disease without booster. would need maintain transmissibility also able evade immune systems/resistances avoid host issue. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol  
Everyone get vaccinated ***should*** get vaccinated. Even they’re recovered. 

Sorry disagree; won’t change anything. 

**And PLEASE find something better non peer-reviewed, unpublished preprint.** 

Low-quality, low-value sources make argument far less credible, fwiw. 

Nevertheless, 

We know vaccines far, far safer catching covid. **By logic**, infection reinfection same, you’d also recommend multiple covid infections vaccines boosters. Like, **who tf actually actually recommends this??** lol

Literally medical professional scientist anywhere would embrace logic, you. Sounds like American shit Sometimes wanna scream know, that's music comes singer you. It’s really emotional appeal. wife literally foot away severely ill Covid positive patients every day. Even PPE risk orders magnitude higher people.

I’m sorry, letting get booster fucking insane quite frankly cruel.  huge wave south Dec/jan CDC list somewhere. showed presentation. It’s conditions early vaccine rollout. don’t remember every single one includes cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, obesity, diabetes, probably 6-10 more.

It’s pretty broad list.  Right? need actual list haha  Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol ""wait safety data"". Makes wonder much data want 6+ billion doses given world wide already. (I know multiple vaccines many different ones, would least half billion per vaccine type) Somehow got feeling could relate. response suspending vaccinations. must give fuel anti-vaxxers. Don’t outlaw smoking then? Anytime breathe second hand smoke detrimental health. 

Which fine with. There's verification anything far. want that. want people easily able get vaccinated. Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol thoughts exactly.  FDA: let’s making illegible booster feel even unsafe! Sigh life tough outcast know. They're going require verification. self-attestation. talked meeting. Yeah it’s bogus. shortage vaccines produced inability produce more? That’s logical reason rationing boosters. Congrats Ireland! 

It’s nice know countries aren’t filled idiots. Noo need laughing stock anyone know Moderna boosters debate? I’m getting past 6 months window soon Absolutely not. pass strict scrutiny. kind dipshit question that? Where’s freedom perform chosen profession? chose airline pilot. “FAA” requirement “licensed” it’s “dangerous” doesn’t overrule constitutional rights! Remember said disrespectful girl got mad took like six tries send message? Lolol I’m buying it. Shit still bad find peace music. you’re receiving Medicaid/Medicare benefits, need vaccine. Like said…extreme lol

I’d fine private insurance mandating too. 

As private companies, Delta Airlines started charging higher health insurance premium unvaxxed employees, suddenly 97% vaccinated. NFL released insane requirements unvaxxed players, rate shot 93%. 

Total agreement cash prizes. backfired lazy people holding money. Oooh that's conservatives full force usual nasty selves. Spain close second even third. iberian peninsula must safest Covid zone world.  becoming endemic inevitable.

Assuming r0 7 vaccine effectiveness 70% Delta we'd need 122% vaccination rate achieve herd immunity simple formula...

My family wanted ask scientist / immunologist while, see lives &amp; safety protocol changed.   Thank you!!  Hey, went Harvard Medical School, okay, knows he’s doing, Ha-Va-D. /s Regarding booster doses, idea people high risk exposure general (not workplace) would able get shots. I’m nyc soon commute work subway every day lot exposure someone somewhere rural driving office. I’m really high risk otherwise long covid funky heart stuff. Look that, uneducated continue overwhelm hospitals. would 10% world population dies left severely disabled? understand talking 750 million people, you? Mormons pretty good following orders come ivory tower. unvaxxed still suffer, know mask protect wearer much vax would delta contagious. one reasons we're mess now. People incredibly selfish. mask great hindrance quality life, that's exactly see you. Today first day Germany stop paying compensation unvaccinated workers forced quarantine coronavirus measures unfair ask taxpayers subsidise refuse get inoculated.

Couldn’t said better blue half put sh!t red half delusional Covid existing all? Germany stop paying compensation unvaccinated workers forced quarantine coronavirus measures unfair ask taxpayers subsidise refuse get inoculated.

Couldn’t said better Many still don’t want close schools. [Almost infected develop long-term symptoms. know damage causes yet, seems cause long-term heart, lung, circulatory issues lot people. may viable older kids, elementary kids awful. school expected 7 year old sit minimum 90 minutes zooms time without break. expected online 8:00-3:30 hour's worth homework. teachers complained last zoom day, focus left.

I don’t think good idea. Honestly I'd say México city is, overall, better city bike lot American cities. Better New York sure.  many kids died COVID states again? can’t catch covid outside festival, numbskull. Last checked, school indoors. mean, responsibility teachers, parents family members get vaccinated? kids can't get vaccinated young every parent teacher eligible. someone eligible vaccinated, problem, kids? No, today first day sensible. would support this.  Oh wish. live Gaetz district. It’s bad bad regarding masking et al would think hospitals would take sign.  Ya say it, declared Kids cry everything. They'll also upset significantly longer something like cold. Screaming one minute poke even register memorable. Every health employer demand vaccination condition hiring.

The ones quit never health care field begin believe science behind it. headline makes mad. Stop giving people reason doubt !!! Though say kids get shots ability give fuck people going diminish lot. rules affect people test positive virus

Sick pay independent vaccination status, least incentivizing someone tests positive keep secret show work would stupid. 

The rules affect unvaccinated *contacts* positives. (You usually quarantine vaccinated, anyway. Obviously, can't get vaccinated medical reasons still receive pay quarantine.) lifting restraining order, Love said believes challenge mandate group municipal unions unlikely prevail. wrote “the state federal courts consistently held mandatory vaccine requirement violate substantive due process rights properly fall within State’s police power.” cited case law going back 1905 upheld government’s authority require vaccines. also said hard unions prove “irreparable damage” result mandate, interests case outweigh broader public health.

Jokes aside, it, place asymptomatic people under-vaccinated populations. Yet people went largely vaccinated. Weird works hospital systems Chicago overflowing covid cases. Crazy, right already Idaho. Students live someone currently covid still permitted attend school. Without masks. quarantine requirement all. 

The in-school incident rate almost double community’s incident rate. 

Our hospitals bursting seams, community suffering still don’t precautions place. 

Because know, RiGhTs!  They'll able pull system - worry it.  required vaccinations negative tests. outbreak Chicago closed elective procedures like last month Florida. even remotely similar. thoughts Hybrid COVID immunity, strong people speculating? teacher COVID January Pfizer series finished March. Scared getting again! Though teach highly vaccinated NYS proper ventilation KN95 masks. Show tax forms five years proving paid ten percent taxes, first. prove religious exemption real. Yeah poor choice words sorry . almost entirely invulnerable harmed COVID, immune infected it.

They *can* seriously affected, incredibly rare, really worry worry similarly low risks. know kids transmit disease like groups do.

Damn, didn’t know Auckland still lockdown. mean, change seats bus somebody nose covered Europe. people vaccinate. difference see, official Moderna booster half strength third dose regular shot.

I’m personally debating whether try get third shot Moderna wait booster strength shot later. None family got it. gf's family 15 people it. 2 got covid, one else tested positive. work mabs, mostly produced CHO cells. upstream production require weeks cell culture bioreactors intermittent fine tuning, followed downstream process involving multiple chromatography steps.

Each process requires USP-grade equivalent reagents, costly. Also chromatography resins/membranes cost lot need extremely well sterilized.

Running manufacturing operation requires shift teams multiple skilled workers weeks per run, months per campaign. Also in-process intermediate needs QCed.

At end get maybe kg mAb, depending high initial titre efficient processing step is. needs bottled distributed either frozen 2-8 degC, involving cold chain transport keep mAb degrading.

At bare minimum, you’re looking $1000 per dose highest yield lowest cost processes. $2000 per dose typical based experience. seems like LOT flu deaths developed country no?  story Sky News adds this:

""The move also reportedly protest state government mandate requiring public school employees Oregon fully vaccinated 18 October.""

Not sure verified though, probably CNN comment. Comparable data biontech=pfizer moderna isnt clear, say x better, say y. general booster doesnt matter basic immunization got, vaccine long gone, thing persists bodys immune system, antibodys, t-cells n such. Personally dont care get biontech moderna. One expect booster shots general, healthy population later on, months. doesnt make much sense booster everyone now. data collected health authorities update recommendations. ridiculous, government encouraging eating healthy keeping fit help body fight covid get it, encouraging eating fast food No. looking say looking at. Portugal 88% total population least one dose. 84% fully vaccinated. 

Now, Portugal bit outlier point among democratic countries. lot countries reach 85% year. Much Western Europe reach 80% year. 90% coverage (outside Portugal) strong restrictions mandates probably required.

For actual data, instead dystopic fantasies, look here: survival

300,000,000 x 0.001 &lt; number already died

Sooooo.... I'm skeptical sign. think everyone took half measures, would least slow transition hospitals aren’t strained high viral loads aren’t passed around. everyone getting minimum exposure disease becomes manageable.

Since changed everyone free easy access various vaccines said law enforced again. Canadian, suspect good citizens Canada   prob 6 rounds MMRV sue ambiguous titer, losing yellow card etc .. lol  Onion article? /s Asymptomatic spread best case scenario. likely scenario kids catch don’t show symptoms 2-3 days also spread even higher viral load day show signs infection. It’s asinine Florida first ignorant advice. say wouldn’t mind kid hospitalized? Obviously wouldn’t want that. That’s point. 

I also wouldn’t want kid miss class every time there’s exposure school even they’re showing symptoms. 

I’m college there’s requirement isolate exposed long monitor symptoms don’t exhibit any. Don’t know different considering low chances they’d get anything mild case.  misleading statistics. current absolute risk admission ICU death England, based cases far, assuming risk consistent across entire population. live different country area different Covid prevalence, soon Covid case kid's class school, sort calculation becomes meaningless.

If want know risk kid dying get infected Covid, death rate 10-19 year olds 0.2% pretty much everyone earth going multiple times point.   read wasn’t sure meant “end pandemic”—end taking smarter precautions end pretending it’s over? It’s bunch celebs, could honestly go either way. understand it, pushing nations encourage vaccine, guess thats…good? one hand don’t disagree celebs activists seem bit silly. Although look many among favorite musicians, writers, artists much politically engaged applaud it. difference, guess, tend remain somewhat outside mainstream pop culture. Burr, really, don’t criticize famous person using platform advance ideas believe in. Unless it’s stupid. that’s bullshit. 😂 Fear mongering nonsense.

That's interpret data 

In ideal world 100% covid deaths would vaccinated.

The statement despite vast majority people vaccinated population, half deaths due small subset people unvaccinated. lol. americans live hypocrisy? Y'all teach world nothing. Yeah maybe person schooling isn’t working pandemic. I'm going guess going waves, become increasingly localized smaller smaller.

Even Delta wave much smaller last years winter wave...and lot restrictions place. Israel's Ministry Health live database containing everything regard Covid (Google translate work)


As see, per 100,000 population older 60, Severely ill numbers 182 unvaccinated, 42 double vaccinated 4.1 booster vaccinated.

As younger 60 per 100,000, 7.3 unvacced, 1.4 double vacced 0.4 booster vacced



Death count reduction also looks encouraging age 60 older around 9.1 per 100,000 unvaccinated, 1 double vacced 0.1 booster vacced Ah. Yes unfortunately viruses still around lol.  combining natural spread

I legitimately asked figured death ratio many many things life.. US close alot higher covid. Heart disease car accidents murder smoking drug oding etc etc. Add ur near millions year no?  many kids dying covid acceptable? answer zero. 

And tell Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Texas, Louisiana Mississippi stop underreporting numbers especially deaths maybe could get accurate number.  ok that's *has* school vaccine mandate. That's way end. went super well Alberta. celebrate irresponsible. I'm back living life. get sick, well, I'll expect days annoyance irresponsible might get more. Oh well. Sucks suck. I'm tired protecting people want protect themselves, I'm going quarantine I'm fully vaccinated feeling weather. might even take sick day. I'll wear mask though. that's it.  Yeah works. employer ask quarantine pay employer allowed ask employee vaccinated employee quarantined. Even risk second dose, mean one first one second, big numbers recipients still increase myocarditis cases population.

I'm saying FDA acted perfectly good, possibly 50 could benefit, knows. Anyway it'd nice fix risk point time deal every time. could need Covid vaccines boosters long time  680,000 dead. 2300 yesterday.

Which include people died non-Covid issues get bed.

Which take account surviving permanent damage.

Do really cost little less price? (~2000$ per dose)? suppose not.

I ""understand"" company evaluation price was: give treatment patient risk going ICU, nonetheless economically worth it.

The problem drug safe, similar monoclonals, probably benefit everybody. Making poorly accessible mean people access it. 

The whole EU purchased recently 220,000 treatments Eli Lilly. 220,000? That's literally nothing. Imagine country 40,000 cases per day, EU could cases per day purchased treatments. Basically people really risk access that, one else.

How supposed drop treatments population way. 

Ofc vaccines I'm denying they're useful (they necessary); still, treatments space. monoclonals treatment actually works asymptomatic/mild cases Covid. others basically already messed patients.

It's bigger covid point, antivax betraying fundamental distrust society public sources information. lot people also ongoing process doubling even they're clearing wrong.

And basing exactly? Wishful thinking?  open public. would agree airplanes like public libraries they're free use point service, considered public transportation. private, personal conveyances. One also pay ride bus travel taxi, they're also considered public transportation. Why? kids age problems Covid often? vaccinated, please don’t make assumptions health.

To answer question, unvaccinated, yes would. Florida dumb. allow parents decide whether students get infected first place like states do? Let's clear. Whether lunatic, strategy.

There whole lot people Florida get vaccinated meaning way pandemic infection subsequent antibodies. They're speeding process expediting process since number die would died anyway longer period time.

Takes bad person fight worse person, guess.  black white thinking regarding vaccine boggles mind. see comments like constantly:

“It’s 100% effective still get COVID!”

Y’all, hate break nothing 100%. That’s fact life. Sorry one tell this. Life comes risks gotta accept that. It’s gamble sure bets. looking odds, would wanna put money vaccine reduces affects COVID caught could save life. life pretty important me, wanna stay alive. 

And yeah, might still get COVID get vaccinated. harsh reality wonder drug - sorry ivermectin eating peeps - keep safe. waiting one refusing best option available lost cause. 

Life full choices, risks, consequences. Pretending world black white fallacy thinking honest, quite lazy. Critical thinking required make informed decisions. Accepting world chaotic nothing 100% must accepted. this, you’re going come wrong conclusions. seems. Funny though, they’re allowing US residents in. US also relying piece paper easily faked. guess read lines, they’re implying US people less likely fake vaccination status people countries. saw news child died flu.  really far wrong. virus mutating specific way already understand. viruses decay begin delete portions genetic code within set amount time. code breaks virus stops functioning replicating. covid patients virus decaying triplicate allows code still function! leads RANDOM mutation changes, vast majority exist within one patient. Eventually one spread become new variant. people wearing masks getting vaccinated means less potential vectors mutations, driving mutations virus mutates! thinking might make sense surface wrong could lead people make public health decision lead worse outcomes (like stop wearing mask). weird world single thing e learned last two years America society now. immunizations cover diseases virus's way deadly covid especially among kids

You said without even looking death rates measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis, etc. think survival rate polio was? ever considered kids become adults vaccines protect throughout life? agree first point extent, still host contagious 2 weeks worse lets say month? Arguably longer incubation periods higher contagiousness would selected lethality. second point, ""goal"" per se contagion kill hosts, rather simply persist spread. look animals alot diseases originated jumped humans, they're often deadly may even display symptoms. Arguably lethality SARS-COVID unintended byproduct jumping species. We're staying three standard deviations away! Well mean feared early effective vaccine rolled maybe half population once. Present evolutionary obstacle *and* large host reservoir time, find out. could require lose weight forgo using state-provided services, choose so. 

Slippery slope arguments really work one item good idea (requiring vaccines decrease odds contracting transmitting virus others) another bad idea (requiring weight loss decrease odds person stressing hospital system).  DeWine lost semblance spine

I live Ohio I'm huge fan DeWine overall, think pointed absolutely insane Conservative State Reps really put DeWine bad place. 

He getting personal threats Amy Acton getting. also facing State Senate permanently removing key powers executive branch pushed harder. Removing Governors ability make emergency decisions worst change. 

Also, things DeWine killed half measures, like bar curfew example, actually positive effect. Come find people creatures habit going go bar 2 hours early party large crowds. Bars remained relatively empty closed. 

DeWine could done more, facing threats families lives, watching kidnapping plot nearby Governor get exposed, dealing true Trumpist maniacs State Senate, honestly think something worse could happened.

There probably politicians brave enough face things, types people rare.  interesting, wonder people happier home... Sheetz. Yea article pretty much sums up. Viruses usually weaken time, past pandemics actually humanity's immunity virus strengthens time every infection/vaccination. Agreed. also get rid speed limits stop lights, seat belt requirements. 

Thousands die every year car accidents, clearly pointless take mitigation measures. wish well. Well that’s interesting. it’s really antivax stance. depending fair real money/reward showing livestock. think I've heard one before....and like ending... actually good? ""I'm county fair fried Oreo""?  pandemic fuelled burnout crisis among frontline medical staff, calamitous mental health workers public health – data analysts policy advisers whose recommendations supposed shape nation’s pandemic response.

Trying talk friend :) Time grab popcorn sort controversial arguing sake arguing guess... include dependencies, Portugal 2nd half half. include dependencies (buy woud you?), yes, 1st half.

Coincidencially, dinner last night Portuguese restaurant called Tio Pepe. good (been before). Bife Portuguesa... finished sauce left plate dipping bread it... lol Life, liberty pursuit happiness. can't banish people society refuse vaccine. It’s disadvantage two-shot regimen. It’s hard enough get people come one shot, it’s inevitable lose significant portion second shot. dream someday JJ-style shot works well mRNA vaccines, that’s probably years off. Yeah man, first shut Disney World porno theaters, chase pimps dealers. What's next? Smoking?? even recognize family friendly theme park anymore Wow, doubled dumb. That’s never good idea. Well get unvaccinated men moving get shot. Zing! longer think know point you’re trying make. 

Yes it’s possible vaccinated someone develop breakthrough case. It’s EXTREMELY unlikely, possible. people vaccinated, less often people going catch and/or transmit it. saying that, mentioned antitheist that's belief, go believe devil. irony, stupidity brainwashing beyond anything I've experienced. kinda sad since best friend one point.  sure agree, except easier centralized approach smaller countries. remember EU managed vaccine purchase batches distributed countries per capita basis, see comparing vaccination rates across Europe (including countries similar population Portugal) major factor population size, rather vaccine uptake/hesitancy. Well, precisely. mean say backup. saw someone local news station’s Facebook page say George Washington required vaccination someone’s genuine response “No, required inoculation vaccination. different.” federal court say forcibly removing antivaxxers hold positions government law enforcement refuse anything antivaxx citizens?

Because ruling seems kind pointless without answers questions. buddy got first shot March never bothered go back get second shot. got pretty sick Covid (and spread rest family) month ago. Dumbass. issue doesnt seem actual vaccine evidence getting jabbed.

A piece paper easily faked. lot bearded men punisher skull hats/3 percenter flags probably angry reacted post facebook  Tell know nothing history without telling know nothing hsitory lol substantial difference anti-vax anti-mandate. this. Losing 30-50% army illness one thing, major outbreak battle lose entire war.

Variolating safer. everyone camp winter ensures get sick campaigning season. told quitting job. I’m honest totally smoking ban. happy say bar owner wants go smoke free great, bar owner wants allow smoking great. state coming along mandating smoke free (to me) wrong business owner’s rights. course bar smoke free wouldn’t able compete, forcing smoke free owners seemed wrong me. 

Then everything went smoke free. 

 went came home wasn’t congested, didn’t drop clothes washer way in, didn’t need shower stink, felt guilt loving happened.   I'm still confused projection northeast going see huge Delta wave October. northeast's vaccination rates like 20-30% higher southern/midwestern states hit hard Delta. sober I'm sober could still kill eachother car accident laws drinking driving! C'mon guys, I've got /new queues refresh here! /s Oh can't scream ""This America!"" correct? really. Grandparents tend baby sitters parents work cases spend time kids. parents tend drift away Thier parents time.
Obviously cases, definitely happens Wow!! Thank this! wondered restrictions place. It’s good hear hospitalizations deaths going pretty much restrictions. I’ve seeing countries high vaccination rates slow decline cases. Makes hopeful! Lethality matter virus contagious symptoms start.

Plus, hosts start dying quickly, deadly variant may die off, remains. host population still ravaged process.  even remotely close 'one smallest countries world'. 109th 198 world terms size, bigger Belgium, UAE, Ireland, Israel, slightly smaller South Korea, Cuba Greece.

In terms population 89th world 10 million, size Sweden, Greece Czech Republic.

If Portugal US state it'd 37th land area - size Virginia Indiana - population it'd 8th biggest state Union, similar Georgia.

So no, even anywhere ballpark 'one smallest countries world'. people come stuff?   realize reason number high compared number men army because, oh dont know, many people alive 200 years ago. probably better compare bubonic plague that. different take flu vaccine gone 10years trials unlike covid barely passed year trials  vaccinated flu quite bit dangerous Covid.

I’m sure dude special. keep using smallpox vaccine gold standard. 

SMALLPOX VACCINE 100% EFFECTIVE THAT’S THERE’S SMALLPOX!!!

Uhh no, smallpox vaccine 95% effective, still breakthrough cases.  strongly believe anti vaxxers see vaccine form obedience towards government opinion understand trust either.

Do trust Government food eat going kill you? trust Government regulations put place around electricity means get electrocuted turn lights on? 

Why would think Government trying kill vaccine. Mistrust Government understandable, line. go life everyday trusting Government put policy regulation place prevent needless death. Covid vaccine different? unvaccinated people endangering everyone else?

When vaccinated father heart attack can't get treatment dies, every nearby hospital's ICU full unvaccinated covid patients, endangering everyone else. difference vaccinated unvaccinated spreading virus?

There places asked vaccinated people start wearing masks Delta variant came US. different even Delta, vaccinated people far less likely spread virus, especially outdoor ones endangering people? going parties activities fully vaxxed living like everything back normal.

To certain extent, sure, also seemingly implying unvaxxed go parties spread disease. true the, limited, protection spreading Delta. 

Additionally, really want wait continue shut shit wait additional 20% country get vaxxed. Mind group full people say silly shit like need least 10 years research sure vaccine safe. want sit home watch world, economy, burn around next 10 years? people start hating people know trust like said 1.

Because general mistrust authority ok, thinking government trying implant microchips, wants sterilize entire country, hairbrained reason people come get vaccinated fucking stupid. stupid shit, publicly, going get hate. 

Again, mistrusting government fucking stupid. trying kill you, gain would Biden get that? trying track you, Facebook well enough is. Mistrust government, fine, act like schizophrenic government get you. people take middle ground this?

What middle ground? either actively contributing deaths others getting vaccinated. middle ground here. hoax know that, government take advantage situation divide spread fear control us.

I tried patient, silly. want worry someone controlling stop looking government. Social media providers controlling many decade barely anyone complains. earth would Government go convoluted scheme control people Facebook Twitter already set groudwork means tested shit last two years.

My recommendation, stop paranoid. government get you. make infertile control you. make fucking sense. would diminish population thus diminish power. nearly power hungry think want opposite? ""forcing people""... hard concept? It’s nurses (although highly mistreated due travel nurse mechanics). work **everyone** run ragged. surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologist, ana techs, surge techs, patient techs, etc. staffed third still pumping cases. covid unit permanently full point new protocols place covid patients must recover actual covid recovery unit full. means lose one operating runs patients recovers. give idea, tower total 12 ORs. five covid patients come covid recovery room one. fourth ORs got delayed. Meaning several surgeries get delayed cancelled. 

The staffing issues going nightmare resolve hire contract based travelers 3x pay meaning simply cannot afford hire staff. 

Get vax wear mask! Unvaccinated people much likely spread virus.

They much likely give virus chance mutate.

They (and have!) caused triage hospitals.

Hey! update?! Wishing best!  incessant need try understand sides things one side weird. Actually, ones interacted look masking vaccination something exclusively protects mask-wearer, rejecting idea protect everyone except mask wearer. totally selfish POV, incorrect terms historical use two mitigations. good news medical grade masks actually hinder that. Smaller particles *worse* getting N95/KN95/KF94/etc, fit mechanical filters better they're far vulnerable electrostatic layer.

Also, seems like evolution smaller particles, rather them. Putting multiple times many particles works well people wearing filter that's 50% effective. Less 99% effective, especially that's ends.

Invest quality masks. main problem disinformation allowed spread TV online, mostly political gain different parties. + premature relaxation lack true restrictions, political gain people. time inoculations (dropping ground smallpox scabs cut people's arms) actually far dangerous anything vaccines even alleged today.

Lots people tight unhygienic temporary quarters, breathing air, struggling keep water poop separate water drink, every cut scratch ample opportunity become fatal infection. recipe death.

The stakes today identical, they're still severe. Right pro-pandemic states shipping sick spare beds anti-pandemic states. even beds still running out.

I seen internet, mainly COVID skeptic/anti-vax people. people saying ""Delta contagious weaker, best thing let everyone get herd immunity..."" (essentially advocating people parents used little kids chickenpox).

That turned good.  issue studies mostly conducted studies outside US, Strongyloides infection endemic.


The general idea giving ivermectin treating COVID steroids, preventing steroids suppressing immune system (something steroids known do) allowing parasite infection take over, causing Strongyloides hyperinfection. substantial number people countries Strongyloides without realizing it. US, that's really problem, data ivermectin good. 


You know Dr. Marik, authored study, notorious able admit he's wrong. years ago lauded sepsis protocol, included high dose Vitamin C, everyone thought would next best thing. Turns data there, Marik proceeded double essentially. Many countries worldwide keep Excess Death counts, (Take USA's every 8 weeks longer many EU countries, shorter say, Canada Japan.

But original 2 doses. possible Pfizer/Biontech booster, even things similar long term stats. Also, Moderna booster supposedly going halved likely allowed get staff site administering shot see got Pfizer/Biontech (or J&amp;J AZ) before. get full Moderna dose, find way get first dose. downside may complicate things trying show proof vaccinated, plus official studies this.

The CDC people also need make broad possible qualify. bad enough FDA said ""65 over"" already delayed long. Vaccinated people getting sick old people. Also: people 65 people medical conditions live among people would qualify --- another problem (and another reason allow everyone boosted now, questions asked).

They need make sure 65 people diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, COPD, hypertension, obesity conditions get without jump hoops explain themselves. Firstly safe ever right now. vaccine lowers risk catching covid also reduces chance hospitlisation significantly still catch it. give peace mind. Statistically speaking there'll plenty others around fully vaccinated maybe vast majority still plenty fully vaccinated people around.

The years passed, mankind became stupider frightening rate. high hopes genetic engineering would correct trend evolution, sadly greatest minds resources focused conquering hair loss prolonging erections. much lower rate due first less likely get infected, cant spread arent infected, second, research suggests viral loads get infected lower vaccinated would reduce likelyhood spread well seems may hold true delta specifically. data fine, read words around arguing someone saying evidence vaccine safe pregnancy. wrote detailed discussion including links primary literature showing safe is.

She replied along lines ""but know safe""

Like read word wrote. infuriating use misinformation brainwash others too. still wish never did. Yes, still neat video though. second link including vaccine related hospitalizations regular hospitalizations. 

your first link include delta wave HUGE impact adolescent hospitalization rates.

Everywhere. can't read story washington post, every pharmacy, every CVS, pretty much every grocery store offers vaccine. US unvaccinated, want be. Lol! topic vaccines mandates dudes like ‘yeah resident evil happens?’ We're Texas, also son IEP, really frustrated. wife home schooling son, he's lost access school-provided speech, occupational therapy, special education services.

Last year opted remote learning option ISD provided, year option. Masks optional, social distancing, changes lunchroom outsider visitation policies. Also, state declined renew COVID waiver allowed K-2nd graders attend established online public schools like K12.com, that's option either. 

Our options send son environment proven, minimally-invasive precautions like mask-wearing social distancing enforced, pull him, lose access services, roll special needs education.

We've opted latter, least able fully vaccinated.

You can't say ""anti-vaxxers allowed endanger 'everyone else'"" also admit vaccinated actually stop endangering ""everyone else"" rather doesn't-endanger badly.

About par governor's response. even great rule thumb 1918 Spanish flu pandemic deadly second wave. many examples viruses get weaker time. Look two different viruses intentionally released rabbit population Australia control invasive rabbit populations. Myxoma virus got less lethal spread, Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus got lethal spread. 

I've seen number people write reddit forums air complete certainty things like, ""all viruses known man gotten weaker time"" -- really idea get stuff from. really gambling Covid getting less deadly.  vaccine rollout goes people immunity either natural vaccine, virus forced become spready less deadly, die out. That's exactly get asymptomatic spread going up. people end sick go home rest... virus become less deadly. Listen. Hand-waiving pure covid theater. 

I’m entertain overly reductionist rhetorical hyperbole.

Last winter vaccines, year do. hospitals stop fucking around prioritizing unvaxed COVIDiots instead normal human beings flu, open laugh unvaxed enjoy winter festivities. fact science advanced enough take 6 years produce vaccine friends scared it. dumb excuse.

""they rushed it!"" ""can't trust it!"". 

Like holy shit I'm tired bible belt dumb people general negating every accomplishment fucking make society like feel like know shit rest us don't. This. Actually studies done last market crash. know lowest amount suicides. Countries high social safety net.

It’s even that. It’s plain wrong. It’s misunderstanding based rule thumb kind thinking biology, things always subject huge number caveats anyway. 

Evolutionary fitness reproduction. Period. Faster cheetahs, smarter apes, cuter dogs fit kids, average. Evolution, things equal, favor genetic variants tend lead offspring, period. talk levels selection (my favorite field) bio 101 that’s pretty much worry about. 

With viruses, you’re looking easily spreads. virus quickly incapacitating less likely spread, things equal, infected person usually become less likely interactions people. However, factors lead infectiousness (how easy given exposure cause infection) independent quickly kills you. turn lethality infectiousness, end either cancelling (same level spread) even disease deadly contagious. 

It definitely lead astray take general rule thumb like “less deadly viruses spread equally” interpret kind universal law. would expected deaths. Vaccine mandates around public since 1905. every one, anti-vaxx idiots tried suing government dony get it. judicial branch US gov says every time.

After reading story..Yes.. exactly sounds like.

this aint chicken pox, aint 80s, 10 years old more.

here's better idea: Throw Vaccine Party. Put together convincing plan county health department, may actually send team administer shots. neat would be. Fire grill, play little cornhole, get vaccinated. OP, think specific city country nears max ICU/bed capacity specific percentage patients comprised individuals sick disease vaccine mandates question address, absolutely justifiable implement vaccine mandates point cities/counties. point, irrefutable proof impact disease community question.

Kids catch young (with rare tragic exceptions) relatively mild symptoms. New kids may get immune protection mothers.

Sincere question someone legal knowledge, can't figure [The court] explained although EUAs issued pursuant FDCA require “medical providers” administering vaccines inform would-be recipients risks associated vaccine right refuse it, EUAs prohibit state requiring individuals, duly informed medical providers, vaccinated.

If state require individual vaccinated, individual right refuse vaccination. section reads like, ""The EUA makes doctor tell right refuse, actually give right refuse."" in,

Doctor: ""I legally required inform right refuse vaccination.""

Individual: ""I refuse.""

One easy method use take Oreos, cover crescent roll dough, batter milk, slap air fryer, take out, cover powdered sugar chocolate syrup, finally (now important step) eat regret it. think mean traits really ""selected""--there's real logic longer incubation periods higher contagiousness would selected lethality.

Like here, there's selection process. mutation randomly occurs lethal humans contagious current dominant variant without negatively affecting replication, we'll lethal variant. mutation randomly occurs longer incubation period contagious dominant variant, we'll variant longer incubation period. Neither ""preferable"" moment neither negatively effects virus proliferates.

I think trying say longer incubation period would allow people get infected, \***that**\* would make likely ""selected.""

But would case evolutionary pressure made difficult variants current incubation period infect people. incredibly case--multiple days' worth incubation airborne virus society people see many people per day create pressure evolution ""prefer"" virus incubation period 3 4 5 6 7 etc. days. get variant longer incubation period, it'd probably result random variation opposed kind pressure seems like thinking of.  police powers granted states constitution always allowed mandate vaccinations. don’t know isn’t discussed media, especially argument mandates “unconstitutional” raised.

I noticed many COVID skeptic/anti-vaxx people internet seem think best way protect COVID get COVID. constantly talking ""natural immunity"" cherry picking information studies show people COVID X times less likely get reinfected people ""only"" vaccinated. fear ever WWII scenario, USA crumble. doubt skeptics people it, critical mass population put everything aside work towards common goal … highly doubt would happen. Someone, likely Republican wanting earn brownie points, politicize effort, making common goal bad thing.  12 year old serious guts. Good him! cannot transmit virus breakthrough case. Hence less likely transmit virus. I'm sorry wife, risk vaccine presents vastly outweighed virus. Covid cause severe heart/vascular issues much much higher prevelance vaccine. 

As efficacy vaccine, yes still catch spread covid, lower rates vaccine. believe unvaccinated individuals 5-fold higher chance infection vaccinated. hospitalizations, vast vast majority hospitalized unvaccinated. sister ICU nurse treating covid patients two vaccinated severely immunodeficient. holds even true deaths. seem unreasonable. Could someone please explain exactly people choosing get vaccinated endangering anyone themselves? 

Sure.

1. Vaccination reduces transmission rates reduces infection rates. goes masks.

2. unvaccinated 12 - 30X likely require hospitalization, take hospital resources vaccinated. [This led rationing \(ie. triage\) Alaska, Montana, also leads long term damage public healthcare system. And, course, make difficult others get health care. maybe particular age group affects. Like 50s wear seat belt might still die car crash even wear right?
I mean silly argument. vaccine significantly decreases risk getting spreading virus. never said would 100 pct silver bullet. still lot better hopen 18 months ago. Tell moron nephew quit job mandated vaccine. yup, got me! i've Vaccinated individuals still catch spread Delta variant COVID. Delta shown seven ten times contagious, viral load nearly 1000x OG alpha variant. get exposed it, got much higher chance catching it, despite vaccinated.

It greatly reduces risk *dying* COVID. even getting sick. vaccinated people likely asymptomatic spreaders.

This means every unvaccinated individual probably going exposed COVID, since vaccinated people might already *may even aware it.* unlike vaccinated individuals, unvaxxed 2/3 chance getting sick, 1/3 chance severe illness leads permanent disability, 2% chance death.

I'd wager people unvaccinated point also sincerely believe one day strike rich lottery, also lose hundreds thousands dollars every time go Vegas, since seems fundamental misunderstanding statistics odds. time inoculations (dropping ground smallpox scabs cut people's arms) actually far dangerous anything vaccines even alleged today. I’m you! work vaccine manufacturing decade, I’m halfway Master’s immunology. amount troglodytes arguing vaccines immune system works ridiculous. 🌍👩‍🚀🔫👩‍🚀   DeSantis drop Herd Immunity sky. virus can't circulate anymore everybody /s 

/notsos  Lmfaooooo Well, simplest answer yes, vaccinated individuals still propagate virus certain means, unvaccinated people catch transmit wildly more. flu walked room, ODDS someone else room would catch way higher didn’t flu, touched something infected touched things room. 

This pretty basic stuff honest.

And second issue, legitimately medically unfit vaccine, that’s fine. Literally immunizations certain subsets population can’t get one reason another. That’s it’s importan EVERYONE ELSE them. reduce transmission.  responsibility protect others? balance Supreme Court Yeah, Richard Nixon’s head needs keep appearances wants re-elected Y3K Unvaccinated people basically much ""desired"" breeding ground virus, means mutations different variants continues reproduce. 

Eventually variant resistant current vaccines could evolve put vaccinated individuals much higher risk. 

The unvaccinated people are, bigger breeding grounds higher chance vaccine resistant variant emerge.  advice needed, thank you. get 1 shot standard Europe create problems road traveling US Terrific. least Federal Court common sense unlike Grand Obstructionist Party.     US hit 75% 12+ 1 dose today! come apple flavor!  Someone showed nice embossed business card said:

""You like smoke. like drink. blow smoke face, piss yours.""

He said he'd pass anyone smoked inside building smoking supposed allowed.  Oooh, hear tastes like apples! 😋 forgetting people can’t get vaccine either allergic one ingredients children age 12.  Except everyone get vaccine right now. Children generally well virus, 100%. also high risk children (e.g. daughter). Also, unvaccinated populations create environment variants gain hold, thus presenting risk vaccinated populations. Finally, unvaccinated people make vast, vast majority people hospital, stressing healthcare system presenting huge risk anyone needing medical care creating hellish environment doctors, nurses, staff.    summary, preponderance available evidence United States schools indicates even students placed less 6 feet apart classrooms, limited SARS-CoV-2 transmission layered prevention strategies consistently maintained; notably, masking student cohorts.34, 55, 74, 85  International studies support conclusions.46, 47, 51, 73  However, greater physical distancing (at least 6 feet) people fully vaccinated prioritized whenever masks cannot used (for example, eating  Many smokers assholes exactly way antivaxxers assholes. believed God given right force others breathe second hand smoke, antivaxxers believe right behave ways give others covid. laws passed forcing smokers stop smoking places also used nonsmokers finally complied. huge relief deal smug, hateful shit anymore.

Maybe they’ll deep fried ivermectin year remarkable day! Montana US dashboards showing covid deaths @ 7:30 am. guess finally thing control.   That’s stupid argument. government tells literally everyday. Drivers licenses okay, hunting licenses okay, laws okay, childhood immunizations okay, suddenly one thing that’s TYRANNY! Lol okay.  No, want publicity funded universal healthcare. hospitals I've worked years smoking banned property entirely, they'd areas around clean air intakes marked smoking, parking areas prevent problem. sure design air intakes top buildings, though. love tug war Texas Florida dumbest state. 

Florida definitely taken slight lead. Game on! you’re less likely catch it, you’re less likely spread it.  want get around close proximity/quarantine requirements best option IMO require masks better filtration aka KN95s. Yes quality little variable even worst KN95 way protection crappy 1 layer cotton ones people still wear reason. I've using KN95s almost exclusively entire pandemic times can't smell/can barely smell mine on.   Inoculation smallpox 5-10% mortality rate time.

Basically Washington knew sacrificing 5-10% army worth smallpox decimate whole.

I read antivax rant said Washington would cry seeing country become agree different reasons. Washington knew men would die inoculation, tiny number like tiny fraction percent severe side effects covid vaccine greater good, virus killed nearly 700,000 people, *over twice size total number men served army wholeof revolution*, huge chunk people take help protect fellow citizens. think founding fathers would disbelief completely wiped smallpox country pretty much eradicated many diseases killed many, there's one astronomical body count millions refusing, mocking chose protect others. I’m pretty sure busy fighting British time. Yes: make understand this?  Yeah, Stat Fair opened we're like Nope! really something could look spreading misinformation: ""Vaccines person. nothing special compared preventative measure,"" Ladapo said. say again! don’t want hit car buy night vision goggles! fault they’re cheapskates. citizens talking about? FYI appears final wording include essential workers would experience repeated exposure. Per acting FDA commissioner groups include ""health care workers, teachers day care staff, grocery workers homeless shelters prisons, among others."" Well course everyone morals left. silliness kicked off, seemed vaguely credible. multiple studies retracted, throwing doubt onto meta-studies relied them. science needed. science currently ongoing. exact thing happened hydroxychloroquine, turned worse useless. 

We idea stuff works not, know reputable medical science groups saying evidence there. 

What know, people going blind overdosing Ivermectin bought feed stores calculating much need based relative bodyweight human horse. second proven work, medical doctors using it.

People trusting horse meds based rumours incomplete science instead seeking proper medical care, people dying result. madness. Take award. George Washington set precedent mandating inoculation army realized men died smallpox british lead. inoculations, different vaccines. 

They would literally cut person put puss infected person cut.

\- 8,165 people would avoided death gotten vaccine (NOTE: people eligible vaccine time period) Uh, yes part plan vaccinating military time could distribute pox-infected blankets native tribes. Vaccines today far less frequent come last minute hesitancy start. 

If creating vials issue, proposing this.   Yeah, way gross. remember correctly involved rubbing infected persons pus open wound body   I'm disappointed mandate vaccines get people take damn vaccine. think would pretty easy convince someone take vaccine could literally save life Shocker. little flu. [data state New York showed vaccine effectiveness dropping 91.7 **79.8% infection**, although vaccine continued protect also:

Please pleasant morning. go get one. US? Literally everyone know (socially- friends family) gotten third.  pharmacies go ACIP tells absolutely surprised get it. hope mom get sick, vaccinated overweight chain smoker... prime breakthrough case. Humans single herd overtime herds loose immunity (either new members immunity, immunity fades, virus mutates). 

Going herd immunity via infection stupid though. that's MAXIMUM numbers deaths occur. Sure end pandemic. bad could possibly done. 

It's solution, capitulation. said, unless going force people get vaccines, see reason delay inevitable. That’s even WORSE then. means 62% population vaxxed makes 56% deaths. That’s absolutely horrible. carry virus longer since takes immune system 2-5 days even start fighting virus. body takes time learn foreign pathogen (covid virus) takes even longer create appropriate antibodies it. Also, since carry longer, spread people virus longer time period mutate. Well I’ve always wanted visit Alaska, many reasons, deep fried oreos get added Katmai Denali  seems kind stating obvious. Variants currently prevalent / dominant contagious / transmissible previous ones. Delta already transmissible, think run hosts first even transmissible evolves (at least pandemic). Long term, would think transmissible would come along tho. God guy hates voters staying alive People continue get vaccinated, catch covid get immunity safe way. Every day people getting immunity wether they're getting vaccinated not. know say man eat man world? 

Does anybody actually say that? I've heard dog eat dog world...  They're something try split like 3 people. Super rich, sweet, I'm gonna pass forevermore. I’m little confused.  didn’t mother take without father?  know kids divorced parents done before. 62% Israel vaccinated. 62% population accounts 56% deaths. 

That’s good. anti-vaxx version ""the civil war fought states rights?"" Except wrong. Pumpkin spiced ivermectin time year. education.

Cvs follows guidelines, actually put barriers ensure they're followed. way since started giving COVID shots store vaccine prevents transmission.

Hopefully adverse reaction trial, live guilt rest life - seems bother anyway Florida, thing happening Maryland.  School started like three weeks ago. missed week school? ""bucked"" mean he's willing pretend steps people take protect virus.  evidence antibody dependant enhancement vaccines? Unfortunately 17% mostly religious groups sides. Yep.

So made Lollapalooza different Trump’s outdoor rallies exactly? I’m already fully vaccinated. there’s plenty aren’t hospital. 

By end month, vax, work! 

Just reporting Southern California. also work 3 hospital it’s same. 

The main one work owns 150 hospitals, it’s policy. Good things it’s nowhere fucking near ten percent. Parent 5 year old 9 year old here. absolutely stick Pfizer soon authorized weeks. unvaccinated children currently biggest worry terms covid exposure, we've avoided things like travel summer primarily due reason. We've planned entire winter 21/22 snowboarding entirely hopes vaccine available children. Florida, huh? Interesting. numbers map.

Here's 21% number elementary schools Georgia. get 37% improvement masking teachers, additional 21% masking Anything qualifies mask fine. likely scenario, says Lessler, children get vaccinated super-spreading variant emerges. 

Oh yeah sure man.  read list 2020 rally locations? paper linking cases deaths rallies? hundred kids died tens millions cases. 

This compared 188 flu deaths. 

The people downvoting idiots. think development nasal mist delivered COVID-19 vaccine could potentially result stronger IgA antibody response would stronger mucosal immunity confer stronger protection infection reduce transmission vaccinated individuals?  hasn’t reported news be. many parents may take notice could save lives kids. possible try reaching media see someone report it? tele-rallies held outdoor lockdowns. False.

In terms rallies 2016 pre-COVID 2020 campaigns. Yes, duh deaths

But one died got sick 400,000 people gathering 8 hours course 3 days masks, social distancing, lax vaccine/negative covid test checks?

Don’t obtuse. Defensive? No, all. I'm asking genuinely.

Please, go on. even happened NYC. Think resources area.  everywhere hit yet. many doctors nurses came area help dig out. bad many places. Nurses doctors burnt out. 

Also many fewer cases overwhelm areas. 

I remember video doctor Iowa tears lost 7 people week. thought point NYC like 7 people hour.  Delta last big variant.  Absolute insanity.  Kharma coming DeSantis Insane problem people decide is.

I get feeling really vocal people continue ""we can't normal again"".

Please ignore make decisions.

That said, know immunology, 5+ threshold. littlest ones going fine.

We're going get virus, we'll get decide protection vaccine not. effectively ends cases (unless medical reason get vaccinated). normally quarantine vaccinated, least long. now, quarantine payments would unvaccinated contact persons someone tested positive, long get sick pay actually Covid (which independent vaccination status). spot american. rallies held resulted least [30000 covid cases hundreds creating class students fall far behind never catch up. saying agree USA healthcare system want countries follow. Seems wise. close border Florida Mexico. /s listening Nicki Minaj medical advice, deserve best lives. infected know it, yes.


 know kids go never know, aware infection still send kid school, right thing, you? surprising pro-COVID party. wanted spread COVID fast possible, way. thing everyone else lets regions suck slide aren’t Florida. got Harvard. really impressive resume, he's fucking zealot got job he's published sorts anti-vaccine crap previously. literally signed paper saying push herd immunity giving COVID everyone. think boosters already vaccinated individuals going thing? be? even tripping Pfizer's 4X% efficacy delta variant? 511 hard think.. Bad bot kid literally licking door knobs, hand rails, actively eating animal food watching. Kids fucking stupid first 6 - 8 years life literally keeping killing themselves. 8 - 12 basically maintenance, 12 - 18 back licking door knobs hand rails, 18 + prayer warriors hands now. California supposedly lowest rate infection. coworker recently mentioned whole family got delta variant despite vaccinated many months ago.

I concerned getting delta variant long-term effects.

Plus girlfriend's family many kids. sure even visit anymore. totally going get sick, likely SARS-CoV-2. Lol yes, they'd *love* give either dose. Ask another card. really hope someone sues shit. source, 45 states reporting, 0.00-0.03% child cases resulted death. 

Thank proving point. ""almost entirely"" really accurate either. Things like MIS-C long covid harmless, affect children less often, 'almost never'. also can't even begin predict long term developmental impact damage found even mild asymptomatic cases. That's lot gamble talking children's lives, people taking chance magical thinking harm vaccines even masks making informed rational decision. ask local government. unclear whether federal government authority mandate masks public indoor spaces throughout country, unlikely happen unless crisis gets much worse. authority regulate public transportation, though, are. makes feel better, Israel data falls outlier spectrum far drop effectiveness goes. data seen across board would doubt we’d see robust vote favor booster. Israel data also quite noisy par limited data have. 

For example remember top head, analysis data peers summer data (June/July) saw vaccinated month March Israel, vaccine effective vaccinated April. Theoretically effectiveness representative noise signal analyzing type data. Unfortunately best way boost signal noise data time. opposite smart mother truckers. idiots fucked us gave gigantic pool people burn through.

Ugh, still clarification timeline person get booster? article saying immunity wanes 6 months, that's elderly get shot, CDC website's page boosters still saying, going be? 6 months, Dad get booster now, 8 months, gonna wait another two months waning immunity. really immensely frustrating point.  God hope Florida goes Democrat year. Charlie Foxtrot. give Florida back Spain. We're seeing 3x many cases right last year time. seriously doubt going decline peak virus season. winter going *brutal*. one planned, finally COVID stress. reservations Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Parks next week. got canceled due wildfire. Can’t seem get break… know Maine numbers bit inflated right now.

Possibly means way worse thought weeks ago cases dropping.

you basically regret first bite. real answer eat hate yourself. evolution actually favor deadly COVID variant case? reason virus spike proteins envelope makes easier enter cells, require less viral load make given person sick/infectious, thus spread easier. Consequently, given initial viral load, virus enter cells immune system catches thus spread much throughout body (most likely translates sick / deadly). That's thinking least. It’s learning established source, deep mistrust experts constant propaganda trust someone lab coat expert something. brainwashed reject expertise. literally evidence it’s shitty article considering it’s backed empirical evidence.

I’d bet that.  anyone help clarify information me? adolescent hospitalization rates COVID-NET peaked 2.1 per 100,000 early January 2021, declined 0.6 mid-March, rose 1.3 April. Among hospitalized adolescents, nearly one third required intensive care unit admission, 5% required invasive mechanical ventilation; associated deaths occurred.
 December 14, 2020–July 16, 2021, v-safe enrolled 66,350 adolescents aged 16–17 years received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (Table 3). Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine authorized adolescents aged 12–15 years (beginning May 10, 2021), v-safe enrolled 62,709 adolescents age group. week receipt dose 1, local (63.9%) systemic (48.9%) reactions commonly reported adolescents aged 12–15 years; systemic reactions common dose 2 (63.4%) dose 1 (48.9%). Reporting trends similar adolescents aged 16–17 years: systemic reactions reported among 55.7% dose 1 69.9% dose 2. dose age group, reactions reported frequently day vaccination. frequently reported reactions age groups either dose injection site pain, fatigue, headache, week receipt dose 2, approximately one third adolescents age groups reported fever. Nearly one quarter adolescents age groups reported unable perform normal daily activities day dose 2. Fewer 1% adolescents aged 12–17 years required medical care week receipt either dose; 56 adolescents (0.04%) hospitalized.

Covid hospitalization rates peaked age group .0021%, hospitalization rates took vaccine .04%? reading correctly?
 
I'm struggling one concerning children. better data would welcome. Seems like person really blowing relationship one angry participating research-backed public health measure. approved data shows needed beneficial. discouraged fact currently looks like might needed! That's great news: two doses thing. 

If data emerges beneficial (and know beneficial), that's bad either, start booster program, take get out, people show up, etc, it'll take effort time, we'll eventually get back current protection.  Thanks Longest I’ve gotten anyone keep 30 days, got you? illustrates really risks necessity right choose.

This incorporating blatant, mindless opposition identities.

He's concerned wife's health way especially freedom, he's pissed ""traitor"". done people? counted days too? Tobacco companies probably ran sorts ads local markets, reach impact misinformation campaigns social media does. screwed. Wyoming, Montana, Nevada problems. Eastern Oregon Eastern Washington essentially Idaho also overloaded hospitals. Northern Nevada wasteland idea what's going there... Hoping make so.

Treating like may never, ever go way might best chance one day eliminating it. cognitive dissonance convinces vaccine ineffective dangerous astounding. Bloody hell!!!! get vaccine! once, believe video situation justice. daily infections graph looks like, we're done yet. 

our WEEKLY trend +82%, never +50% 2 months. doubling cases every 2 weeks faster. recently maxed ICU capacity, extra beds doctors / nurses. deaths increase soon, since ICU can't handle anymore patients.

my country studied bad example reach herd immunity  Thats wordy way saying “I already decided opinion topic going ignore anything contrary it.”  Triage    media’s overfocus breakthrough cases. one Ohio teacher article sub really set Yep. Without Dr. Acton stand behind, Dewine afraid anything own. ask name parts immune system, name one reagent used processing, statistical formulas. 

Basically ask details job. fun. I’d like add vaccinated unvaccinated viral load, vaccinated people carry viral load several days shorter unvaccinated. make sure check list high risk conditions, cover LOT people think may end covered without knowing remember going Florida 2010 people smoking bars. I'm well versed laws gambling establishments only. Maybe area abiding laws, I'm sure. Michigan, like everything except southeast (Detroit) spots rural here. usually am. :) agree 100%. disagree DeWine issues, respect hard tightrope walk he's covid. He's always pushed masks, always pushed vaccine, 100% board science I've seen. gets respect alone. Also refused meet Trump airport last year cute.

The real problem OH, pointed out, hard right legislature. really hope figure way balance we've got loonies right now. Finally call malicious individuals Thanks much response! kept reading conflicting reports Moderna J&amp;J process.

And that's weirdly concern Moderna - I'm glad generally held well, grandparents recieved Moderna hope least approve 65/75 older *any* data suggesting wanes older folks.

Really crossing fingers get boosters figured three vaccines holidays... probably right&lt;3 Yeah, that’s said it. :) **420** people made joke already    I?(: moderna definitely seemed come top one, even adequate even much bette expected Technically vaccination subset innoculation. process introducing live virus body typically variolation (named smallpox virus - vaccination named cowpox virus used create smalpox vaccine). done smallpox.

Also vaccination done similar way variolation introduction live virus (cowpox smallpox). Vaccination though requires pathogens weakened compared actual disease (or case mRNA vaccines needs induce immune response) whereas variolation (e.g. cowpox much less deadly humans smallpox vaccination cowpox much safer essentially weakened smallpox).

Variolation used prevalently smallpox *major* *minor* varients - granted immunity towards other. minor varient introduced healthy individual much less likely individual would die.

Both forms innoculation (vaccination variolation).

But yeah everything said applies though. figured much. People either going vaccinated Delta going find one way another.

We're headed straight herd immunity. easiest safest way... Yes. Sadly tell fact he's teacher. It’s ok, used it. :) angry enough punch nurse, imagine wife... right. Stupid me. Yeah threw cloth ones late July use kn95 government utilize vaccine passports states havent already

If aint vaxxed, shouldnt allowed anywhere near non essential businesses.  Vaccinations increased areas high death. We’ve seen since Missouri outbreak. Anti-vaxxers refuse vaccinated, opposed want shot trouble accessing them, largely cult. Increased deaths overwhelmed hospitals don’t cause change behavior. 

Those people 100% keep pandemic going US. right use antivirus software computer let become malware-riddled nightmare.

I **don’t** right connect virus-laden computer home, work, school network. 

My right stupid give permission let stupidity negatively affect others. Banishing people society accidentally actively seek diminish life, liberty, happiness others *LITERALLY LAWS ARE*.

You described driver’s licenses: “you can’t prove safely”

You **described jail**: “you proved couldn’t safely banished” Delta Variant far dominant strain US, vacvinated people arent dying except extremely rare edge cases. However thousands unvaccinated dying daily.

It works fine Delta variant. Probably quitting teaching would best thing could may financial position that. Ohhh Damnn

Sounds like don’t like it, need leave think lot us gotten hopes getting back normal many times since started hesitant believe good, optimistic news end pandemic anymore.  recycle articles June? pretty much too. Wait wasnt Australia one countries still normal pandemic practically cases?   took train Japan 15 years ago failed make reservation day before. seats left smoking cars. take train, figured bad.

Big mistake. ten minutes, take anymore. stood up, walked non-smoking car, stood two hours train thinned took seat. I'm pretty sure things changed. Lol yup dude bailed. social end already here; better worse.  get mail, go grocery shopping, anything else. people straight liars trying broadcast love trump even though got vaccinated months ago. free put another chair classroom. even believe onus find information. boss want get vaccinated, concerned what's them. told find ingredients online, goes, ""why responsibility?"" like want pharmaceutical companies snail-mail info pamphlets something adults found yet.  ….his “consent?”

I can’t even begin detail irony here. know, think may figured disconnected. think interpretted first post suggesting virus would mutate less severe strain time? Perhaps asked medical sources. know virus mutate benign strain intent suggest would. 

But *do* know vaccinations result less severe cases overall, become common. So, said cases become less severe people vaccinate, *that* referring confused request sources. virus stay exactly is, experience change dramatically, vaccinations. one? hope. guilty people breed virus make stronger. surprised dont even common sense. people can't get vaccinated even though want to. die, died you. Additionally people like prolong pandemic leading mutations, break throughs, deaths. lot less vaccinated people die course, already see. Thankfully mostly people like die, still, every vaccinated one dies also fault. Easter. fair, specify Easter.  probably likely catch covid grocery store plane.

I’d like thought experiment think this. First, we’re talking virus like one, main factors disease spread call three D’s - distance, duration, (the important) droplets. virus seems behave like viruses familiar potential developing Covid possibly severity disease bounded dose dependency, else equal. higher initial exposure load is, likely you’ll get sick. relates directly much virus enters nose mouth. 

The size number droplets going constrained distance. Bigger droplets fall close infected person, smaller droplets carry further. Let’s say use four size categories - big, medium, small, tiny. Big fall within couple inches normal breathing/talking, within couple feet coughing, sneezing, singing, yelling, etc. you’ve ever noticed accidentally spat upon someone talking yelling you, probably these. sizes fall progressively away. additionally factor overall particle count per unit measurement going decreased approximately cube distance, that’s volume works. tiny ones ones float arbitrary amount time, get recirculated AC, etc. 

Duration also factor. see someone standing six feet away infected person going exposed orders magnitude fewer particles someone standing face face, face face contact fleeting distances exposure lasts hours, things might start even out. Given dose dependency, means likelihood developing Covid also going based duration contact. 

An actual experiment would difficult Nazi-level unethical perform, thought experiment think whether model indicates standing foot away someone five minutes equivalent standing three feet away hour, whatever. see thought experiment suggests it, think implies. 

So, sitting next someone plane four hour flight likely much worse passing someone aisle. someone sitting behind (let’s call three feet away) coughing sneezing also likely worse. someone seated ten rows front likely better. 

And don’t forget factor additional variables like masking hand washing. live, virtually everyone stores masked. Many use hand sanitizer way in, carts, way out. Sitting plane food drinks served generally unmasked. Masks, per thought experiment, address droplets (by catching most) distance (by reducing velocity escapees). 

This leaving aside perfectly legitimate interesting difficult questions like “is average person traveling air pandemic flare-up less likely Covid average grocery store shopper?” might think true given air travel riskier (to general public) less required rarer behavior grocery shopping correlate general risk tolerance person taking pandemic seriously. leave one side interesting complicating factor though. 

The TL;DR physics scenario make us skeptical passing sick person masked grocery store risky someone unmasked seated next four hour flight. 

Air recirculating isn’t going help that, person two rows behind coughing violently. 

And still leaving aside fact least grocery store levels exposure airports flight. 

At end day, might end concluding one flight risk five months worth grocery store visits something. 

Anyway, empirical studies funded travel industry published date still resolved kinds questions thought experiment suggests, noise know (no systematic testing, negligible contact tracing US - minimum) suggest data might subject additional scrutiny.

I'm fine adults lighting smoking want -- freedom that. choice, shared space activity impinges significantly people's freedoms. know ever got accustomed letting smokers that, good riddance far I'm concerned.

The real difference covid stink place process, smoking less immediately hazardous contagious. many ways covid much worse public health perspective.    dunno, would think terms drug administered, FDA would reign supreme? sure CDC, disease control, would trump them. could totally wrong.

These answered 1000 times. Sort Best read.  Jesus Christ dude... can't believe gonna argue that... Portugal fucking tiny shit. However, kick ass country, great food, great people, lot history fucking beautiful. small. Nothing wrong that. ever attacked home soil, kind unity 9/11.

Unless Russia apparently Trump head force talking peacekeeping force.

then think would solid 10-15% population cheering support Putin shits Resolute Desk. Wasnt whole episode scene SATC Mr Big light cigar restaurant told put went rant confronting diners problem said used evidence allowed smoke? Might different show. Never mind that. drive right side road like oppressive government tells me? free country what? heard immune system works better vaccinations. lack measles, smallpox, COVID-19 polio life confirms    No, decision says opposite. right unvaccinated. right participate society, interference right must name valid government function. failed show managing pandemic invalid state function.  Sure, hopefully find someone explain analogy. Easy. December vaccinations came out. She’ll still comes goes. worst possible times seems! Can’t open due geoblock laughed. 

Damn copy paste!!!!!   HIV gays, COVID patriots boomer. Thankfully grew realized dick. people focused using ""thoughts"" ""prayers"" on. still need cdc sign too? Even fda approval, still can't get booster yet. answer simple:

The vaccine provide immunity. lowers chance catching spreading disease. everyone (who could) get immunized, spread rate would low sustain itself.

At time, spread COVID US primarily result people getting vaccinated. did, rate spread would drop much risk exposure would minimal. Maybe need someone explain it. Go find grade schooler, they’d understand. used argument brother who's rural Austin now, hits better safe hospitals time normal cases, beds full.

Now offering 300 dollars shift areas nurses, pay per shift, weekly biweekly.

Here NYC live kept hearing ambulances 24/7 March, May. bad work hospital kept hearing even noise canceling headphones on.

Take imagining it, even therapy still dwell sound. hear every day work, getting easier yeah left mark.

Rural areas burnout really quickly, county boarders never really EMT's quickly become roadblocks. transfers neighboring counties/states last option. allow US residents in, US doesn’t vaccine passports. piece black white paper people caught faking US get places.

So certificate fakers US okay, India not? call kind policy? think starts ‘d’. Good. expand mandates anyone living someone unvaccinated well. Including children.  guess question along many employees sticking around mandates. least places hospitals government buildings. work larger private company see couple people department exiting stage right mandate hits less month's time.

Haha, help myself.  spot it'll late get critical trying point people care enough. someone explain things? Know fully vaxxed (Pfizer) I'm trying understand sides story.

1. strongly believe anti vaxxers see vaccine form obedience towards government opinion understand trust either.

2. unvaccinated people endangering everyone else? 

3. What's difference vaccinated unvaccinated spreading virus?

4. ones endangering people? going parties activities fully vaxxed living like everything back normal.

5. people start hating people know trust like said 1. 
I mean people bragging Facebook vaccines whatever kind shit come with, ones hear about. hate towards people seems generalized may spreading disinformation trust yet people making fun hating people.

6. people take middle ground this? think truths sides story, example: covid hoax know that, government take advantage situation divide spread fear control us.

October 1st major ticket providers go vaxx only! good time music venues! able upcoming CDC meeting. still attest he's immunocompromised, course verified either, story. Florida joke.   Anti vaxxers would make something anyway. 

I prefer scientists upfront. unofficially, would want to? went way mine evidence better duration, sure want go way. I'd context clinical trial. rush Many already procreated though impossibility. they're not. honest, recommended anyone ""high risk"" (which almost certain mean CDC's current definition that, 3/4ths Americans) *and* anyone job puts higher risk exposure.

The risk covid outweighs far know that, chance make things incredibly broad vague otherwise. Hot diggity damn! Covid problem though, restrictions requiring children self-isolate. start treating endemic disease means accepting community transmission. Expecting anyone contact positive case self-isolate, realistic. 

I honestly surprised many countries vaccinated 12s. course experts recommend it, should. think clear cut completely obvious decision vaccinate adults. article says around 6 months second shot. Every single year now. healthy idiot. Entirely avoidable. 

What embarrassment. unfortunate need care/are vaccinated. actually is. key donor heavily invested Covid treatments hospitals use fight disease. get infected, money flows way. know I'm talking vaccination only. venues really liberal areas started I'd love see concerted effort.  mmmmmmm money! section caught eye:

Thoughts?  FL surgeon General? mind kid one 21,000 hospitalized covid someone sent exposed kid school, knowing could spreading covid?

Sources vary bit, average hospital stay covid seems 17k. 
If insurance, yes, fair amount covered. drives insurance rates everyone, including yourself. 

Keeping exposed child home couple days costs sick/vacation days cost someone take care kid get negative tests, assuming parent stays home anyway.

But hey, many kids die, fuck it. way. Covid really problem here, restrictions. Forcing children constantly self-isolate close contact eventually end harm good, they're always missing schools. accepting Covid going circulate community seeking eliminate it, can't isolating every person ever contact them.

Masks continually recommended 12s impartial scientific advisors majority year DfE ruled children close contacts confirmed suspected cases need self-isolate unless also display symptoms. 
 
They sound like schools south mitigation kids.

Same thing happening Ireland recommended one cautious public health teams Europe. evidently rash decision.

This really stupid thing say true vaccines prevent transmission 100% greatly reduce transmission. happened countless vaccine skeptics latched onto statement associated video clip making rounds ever since.

I think reason said justify vaccinated people still need wear masks. misleading point dangerous.

What means vaccinated people **who get breakthrough infection** spread virus, still rare, like 0.5% vaccinated population. like moron say gave vaccine skeptics bunch ammo. SME here. feel pain. absolute bullshit completely false info people spew insane. people blindly agree also unreal. 

Its always oversimplification issue, looking symptoms root cause, anecdotal evidence, false equivalence something else, lacking baseline compare, vague details, toss phrase “common sense” 20 years later almost population problem investigating January 6 terrorist attack. vaccine 100% prevent transmission?

I agree Bill Maher, wish would focus issue relation Covid (and health risks). Please share turns out. appt cvs next week. anti mandate argument isnt valid position. thousands mandates various forms. Whats difference one? Yep. learned atheists/agnostics Portland treated sooooo much better evangelical Christians Salem. might still winter gave given Delta etc vaccines prevent mass wave deaths hospitlisations. Israel UK seem shown vaccines weakening link hospitlisation cases. Cases risen dramatically countries daily death figures also risen risen pace we've seen vaccines. Heyohhhhhhh banger read agree, really encouraging. However, think simple comparing percentages. dig deeper cases might find vaxxed people dying 70+, significant comorbidities, etc., whereas younger, healthier unvaxxed population dying.

I know -- dug in. I'm saying think simple appears.

Get vaccinated. Portugal caralho!!! Yes, that's antibodies memory t-cells important. Antibodies dont live long own, memory t-cells remember make act factory make virus arrives fortunate enough live area never large enough outbreak reach full icu capacity. 

I guess could argue that, healthcare publicly funded tax dollars, potentially becomes tax burden likely require hospital’s resources. problem argument could extended people drive motorcycles, overweight, play sports commonly result injury etc etc. Thus far little seasonality associated Covid-19. new waves almost entirely dependent new variants outcompeting old variants. Unless something comes along competes Delta, wouldn’t expect fall/winter surge. expect seasonality Covid-19 enters endemic stage. true ""breakthrough"" infections, vaccinated viral load unvaccinated.. vaccinated person much less likely catch therefore much less able spread it. Things like make realize honestly believe shit, cynical political plot. He's killing voters? honestly comprehension republican thought anymore. think any. ""Ivermectin Nobel Prize winning medication""

Great meme, totally leaving anti-parasitic agent anti-viral. Also leaving Merck, makers Ivermectin, said therapeutic effects Covid19. Isn’t point vaccine prevent serious complication/symptoms rather catching disease together?  news outlets collaborating keep us divided tuning night see people stupid smart.  That's taught period (maybe country difference, teacher school). Saying men always choose generic pronoun really unfair generalisation, sure way see it, they're sexist. Regardless taught ""officially"" correct way is, I'd strongly argue using either gender specified male female incorrect, least problematic, specific general context. way, saying ""he/she"" instead ""they"" incorrect/problematic unless specifically talking people binary gender identities (which is, time, case) excludes NB people statement. logic, original comment said ""their"" rather ""his/her"" there's reason NB people can't doctors. hope long paragraph makes sense think also consider effect unauthorized boosters is. know people going third shot despite approved. That’s going give us inflated numbers getting first shot—and people aren’t going come back “second shot.” 'Patriot Punctures' I'm Jersey, come chill little bit want. multiple ways measuring infectious someone is, get different answer depending measurement. 

You measure (when someone comes ER like), compare highest measurements vaccinated unvaccinated.

You measure multiple times see measurement changes time, means need test experimental subjects daily harder arrange.

And different things measure: 

 - PCR cycle threshold - rough measure much virus RNA detected sample (easy &amp; safe, well calibrated)

 - attempt see virus swab actually grow cell culture. (more difficult &amp; fussy, potentially hazardous succeed).

What studies found (I dig references like):

 - peak PCR cycle threshold infected vaccinated unvaccinated individuals (same peak infectiousness *if* PCR good proxy infectiousness).

 - PCR cycle threshold drops faster vaccinated individuals (less area curve -- spend less time able infect others).

 - harder grow virus vaccinated individuals, suggesting PCR tests counting shredded/deactivated virus bits rather viable virus.

 - contact tracing Singapore shows little evidence spread vaccinated individuals.

So, roughly speaking, increase carefully measure, better vaccination looks. Florida pigs must caught live boy dead girl. Costa del sol, halfway Marbella Gibraltar pretty much.

Stephen King's Stand.  Unfortunately I’m 2000 miles east west decent seafood spots listen anti-vax rhetoric. Well get 2 shots count fully vaxxed anyways without PCR test.

So get vaccinated, tell em sick PCR done.

The article go details, like wrongly claims wife property.  Thank you. frustrating. empathy sympathy anti-mask/anti-vaxx folks contract Covid, completely gone. care sound callous. Please stay safe well. indoor smoking ban happened here, remember anyone protesting it. knew bad us, enjoyed it. drug.

I smoke time, thought stupid ban smoking bars concerts, made sense ban restaurants cafes. Every smoker knew willing either step outside, sit window law, bother people with. especially common get different sites. record first doses, state databases may may look since state threw together solution. time spend spreading virus important - virus makes really sick forces host isolate (stay bed!) possibly even die, reducing days spread.

Common sniffles common reduce people groaning bed day. problem is, already one flu

Meanwhile poll says vaxxed would get booster ASAP. 

That's basis thinking. Ofc polling perfect dichotomy really illustrate polarization country CDC trying walk line between. said fda advisory committee meeting, I’m saying cdc ACIP meeting: “the science” can’t simultaneously tell us we’re sufficiently protected, also peril need keep wearing masks altering lives. 

If former true, great! Tell everyone get back normal. it’s not, stop worrying factors data, implement boosters get us there.

Looks like need go back important schooling you’re talking take spelling classes. people would simply follow basic precautions listen actual science morons like wouldn’t situation worrying sending kids school safely.  Yeah got call close contact like noon test done 1230 Good. Pfizer’s efficacy waning fast, booster desperately needed.

I’m attempting it. Otherwise I’ll wait til official roll next round. Holy shit, going suck medical worker FL.   sounds like wife actual legitimate reason medical exemption, no, shouldn’t get booster.

The issue areas run flare-ups like Delta variant, unvaccinated flood overwhelm hospitals, prevents people getting needed treatments they’d otherwise able get. hospitals overwhelmed caused deaths, telling many health issues could prevented people able get care. hospitals could refuse treatment unvaccinated, discharge (regardless condition) vaccinated patient needs treatment, would less problem unvaccinated. sounds harsh, mind person get vaccinated refuses right effectively prevent others getting needed treatment. That’s exactly what’s happening, though. think need 90% entire population, 16+ historical sense time decimate meant kill 1/10 soldiers case willing decimate army save more. consistently \~10% gap ""at least one dose"" ""fully vaccinated"" across age cohorts going back least 6 months now?

Northwoods Community Church Far North Peoria placed website form members attendees request statement affirmation regarding objections mandated vaccinations.

Religious exemptions become topic discussion President Joe Biden introduced plan require COVID-19 vaccines many 100 million American workers, condition employment. cases, weekly testing virus would accepted lieu vaccination.

'Vaccination mandates infringement' constitutional rights statement website recent Sunday service, Northwoods officials said support churchgoers believe inoculated. officials also stated support whose faith leads believe be.

""We believe Constitution United States provides freedom right person follow religious beliefs convictions limitation right direct assault fabric families, freedom, education, employment, and, ultimately, country,"" church statement read, part.

""We believe recent vaccination mandates infringement rights.""

The form asks respondents basic identification, information attendance church, name employer accommodations employer might offer regarding vaccine objection. also asks specific beliefs led respondent request exemption.

Church representatives might contact respondents additional questions, according statement.

Northwoods Senior Executive Pastor Mike Bell referred statement declining answer Journal Star questions church's policy. churches willing discuss topic religious exemptions.

'Part Christian submission' Richwoods Christian Church, nondenominational congregation North Peoria, entertaining vaccine exemptions, according lead pastor.

""We know COVID's real thing. vaccines real thing. know data,"" Chad Manbeck said recently. ""But we're compelled basis faith, scripture, something we're supposed local church.""

Manbeck said several Richwoods members asked vaccine exemption. acknowledged conversations easy.

""You work somewhere else, get vaccinated,"" Manbeck said options. ""And God, believe, work them.

""Part Christian submission. follow things may may agree with, long defy God tells us do.""

A religious exemption 'hasn't part thinking' Rev. Chip Winter Redeemer Lutheran Church Northwest Peoria said heard congregants regarding vaccine waivers. asked might say someone requested one, twice started answer paused time.

""I guess really thought through,"" Winter said. ""I guess understand religious exemption. part thinking.

""I would want talk them. would like counsel them. would probably seek guidance church body, far practice would this.""

Winter, also teaches Concordia Lutheran School Peoria, COVID-19 year ago vaccinated April.

""I felt need that, since I'm ministering sorts people,"" said.

Winter said might understand exemptions abortion opponents object COVID-19 vaccines tested fetal cell lines. lines developed laboratories vaccines contain material, according Associated Press.

Catholic bishops Colorado South Dakota willing consider exemptions, AP reported. according Vatican, danger pandemic lack alternative vaccines outweigh objections medicine developed.

The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese America Church Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints among religious organizations providing exemptions.

Manbeck said understands Northwoods point view, well churches might offer religious-based vaccine waivers. also said believes free understands people might want want vaccinated.

But rather enter secular realm contentious polarizing, Manbeck prefers emphasize higher calling.

The CDC website states: “Infections Delta variant vaccinated persons potentially reduced transmissibility infections unvaccinated persons, although additional studies needed.”

So without hard evidence reduced transmissibility, exactly getting vaccine help wider public? (Already double vaxed, hypothetical question)  seem be. given public stance it.

I highly doubt they'll mandating them, though. office office?! Im even kidding! wearing mask despite fact vaccinated, PERSON office wears mask.

They realized pretty quickly sending someone home mild COVID would unleash hell entire family.

I think China first started - whole families getting sick elderly grandparents passing people sent home isolate.

It’s quickly pivoted separating families isolation field hospitals. completely agree limitations public discourse. Instead, things polarized, divisive, dumbed point name-calling public policy (thank you, Trump).

My understanding was, 2020, said lock flock down, everyone done that, disease would burned out, able spread replicate. Instead, allowed spread via social contact, giving time mutate newer interesting variants.

[Galactic sorta take step back... that's diseases work- evolution favors organism adaptable. Mammals survived hostile environment dinosaurs smaller, needed less food, better able handle temperature fluctuations (we think)

COVID, Delta especially, able survive thrive despite ""hostile"" environment respiratory diseases... therefore logical think it'll remain stronger Flu years come. Wow. big man. 6 feet tall, punching woman face several times running away (didn’t even give second respond insane comments either).

How incompetent govt manage coverup big? 

How faking data vaccine hospitilizations?  now. say “can answer yes statement” showed paper saying something immunocompromised said “yes” it. questions. However make sure fill online questionnaire end process answer “yes” immunocompromised. let go end even answer they’ll stop desk say it. happened made correct haha. issues! see, that's cute. Alternative headline: ""Florida care teachers school faculty."" already follow everything Trump tells except vaccine weirdly enough  Nope, lots people go searching there. It’s pretty funny.   employers allowing people get daily/weekly tests means prove that. So, there's option.

Also, COVID think protected long-term sick, really delusional. change bio me? coincidentally applicable situation? thats best ability yes, obviously can't much. 

Everyone tiniest bit intelligence see that, guess talking intelligence someone puts vaccine quotes wasted effort. problem unvaccinated idiots solve time anyway, sad drag normal people along you. Otherwise people could go delusions want nobody would care.  Everyone get vaccinated. Delta risk factors. Younger people dying 18 months ago started.

Every zombie movie I've ever watched I've always frustrated stupid people act even know zombies thing. pandemic taught movies probably fully capturing level stupid we'd see. comparison vaccinated masked population fares Delta data coming Tokyo.

I'm really *really* crossing fingers approvals quicker much less controversial, they've discussions Pfizer. article mentioned people transportation, undocumented immigrants fear they'd need show documents. like it, see necessary. absolutely did. false super upvoted reason. Tobacco companies absolutely major misinformation campaigns downplaying dangers cigarette smoke, including secondhand smoke. get vaccine, aren’t danger regardless neighbor isn’t vaccinated. That’s point vaccines. I’m usually correct, yeah  states, yes. 

Not Federal government. probably correct. good assume things to... downvoted comment we'll got backs scratched way.  Well mean experts predictions deadly Covid based actual evidence plethora past current data. it’s less prediction interpretation existing data. Predictions future best expert opinion. read part thread? like brought nowhere **69** percent Vermont's population fully vaccinated.

Nice!  Game's 45 mins. watching/going? True. vaccine prevent infection. prevent extreme reactions infection death. Wonder fact 12-15 still EUA 16+ fully authorized make difference respect Jacobson v. Massachusetts interpreted cases like this. almost inevitable someone refuse kid 12-15 range. Better comparison vaccinated masked population fares Delta data coming Tokyo. Went 200 new daily cases 5000 new daily cases back 200 daily cases Delta takeover wave.

The mass vaccine roll-out (was 3% population June 1, almost 60% fully double vaxxed today) head-on battle Delta July onward far vaccines winning.

Kids back school already &amp; people's behaviors changed much before. major explanation vaccines work, even full frontal assault Delta. That’s fair, you’re probably pretending since hate tolerance.  rude assume got somewhere. case original strain, Delta affecting younger. understand word certification means right? clear worried fake covid 19 vaccine passports? Heh. actually signed trials. Didn’t get in. pretty comfortable risks types vaccines. 

Kids different. react weirdly things risks amplified ways don’t predict. Man, argument makes feel old.

Just know, (a ""geriatric millennial"") taught use him/her individuals plural. required lot reprogramming accept they/them singular, still slip sometimes. First, see comments, vaccine good original COVID. issue Delta (thanks anti maskers people believe COVID). viral load Delta roots nose, lot antibodies take care it, makes easy spread.

Secondly, proof vaccine *caused* wife's mycarditis?

Thirdly, even did, sounds like got unlucky side effect extremely rare. sorry say this, millions people could save vaccine worth wife's inflamed heart. think Dutch need reform. They’re rude. join?

I’m still pro-vax. anti-Dutch. I'm glad think good making perfect analogies. Hopefully find someone defend you.  Well probably incomplete record keeping. sure lot people lose cards get 2 shots 2 different places. definitely global tracking system.  downside leaving? go found private plague school together! story, you’re vaccinated greatly reduces risk infected. you’re infected don’t transmit it. 

It’s rare vaccinated people become infected (that’s breakthrough case). possible people breakthrough case infect someone. CDC added breakthrough infections “occur small proportion vaccinated people breakthrough infections, transmission vaccinated appears small part overall spread virus.” 

Let’s put perspective. 

100 unvaccinated people room. One person covid delta variant enters coughs leaves 30 min. Approx 40 unvaccinated people get infected spread among rest unvaccinated. 

100 vaccinated people room. One person covid delta variant enters coughs leaves 30 min. Approx 3 4 vaccinated people get infected spread among vaccinated. 

That’s difference. That’s everyone get vaccinated. 

1. Breakthrough cases RARE, 
2. people vaccinated less spread happens. Celtic fan Florida. shook. Hail hail would look fully vaccinated guessing many refusing vaccination? 74.9% eligible population least one shot, 76.7% adults, 93.3% 65 years older. Brb gotta pick carmel candy horse paste! article Germany. one else first world wants healthcare system become like US's.  strongly believe anti vaxxers see vaccine form obedience towards government opinion understand trust either.

The government requires carry card name address it, set speed drive, make pay register car, get job let know make sure take social taxes pay check. 

You obedient government dozens ways every single day nothing new unvaccinated people endangering everyone else?

unvaccinated people carry significantly higher viral loads get significantly sicker, clogging hospitals harming people seeking emergency treatment things like cancer What's difference vaccinated unvaccinated spreading virus?

Again, viral load. viral load significantly higher unvaccinated higher chance spreading it, spreading dangerous amount it. ones endangering people? going parties activities fully vaxxed living like everything back normal.

If everyone fully vax'd could back normal would essentially neuter COVID. We'd see hospitalizations trickle nothing illness would become weaker weaker cannot find suitable host procreate would eventually die within couple months. Even spread easily unvaccinated, gets weaker every time instead stronger. people start hating people know trust like said 1. mean people bragging Facebook vaccines whatever kind shit come with, ones hear about. hate towards people seems generalized may spreading disinformation trust yet people making fun hating people.

I even understand trying say here. ""just trusting"" vaccine **six billion** doses taken thousand adverse reactions somehow shield hate? baseless mistrust become virtue? people take middle ground this? think truths sides story, example: covid hoax know that, government take advantage situation divide spread fear control us.

Because middle ground easy solution makes feel better everyone often wrong. Would like try applying logic wildfire evacuations? 

Heres another way phrase middleman argument you, disobeying every order dumb obeying every order.  said say 2nd half size-wise? Nice Google search, way.
