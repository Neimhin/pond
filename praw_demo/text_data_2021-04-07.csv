No. “COVID staff reduction” May, laid 500 people, posted increased profits every quarter since then. applying standard. ""I qualified train people. Please see corporate trainer that"". students online 3 weeks corona started theyre still checked out. Im side this. dont go back office, Im quitting. ever 15? great grades high school, 15 option just....not...yeah dumbass 15 year old brain would probably school either. Haha Midwest lowest unemployment.. it’s actually crowded. wouldn’t move expensive city live like poor person, wouldn’t someone move place jobs better standard living price.. oh yeah California dreaming. I’m relatively healthy that’s good news hear. lucky enough get neurological problems, however heart basically fucked (normal BMI bit underweight; shape, etc.). year really gotten better. careful there, life basically ruined. Lol. See fools actually lose job. 100% right. usual, intelligent comments downvoted I'm glad company work embracing new world, productivity great since moving away office work, allowed us attract talent across country instead local area, getting rid headoffice buildings.

The expectation attend office larger meetings events, mainly remain working home 75/80% time.

Those want work office allowed won't.

Hurrah, absolutely prefer working home, gives back nearly day week commute faf time.

Now sow seed moving 4 day week (☞ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)☞ US pretty consistently two week gap doses delivered doses administered. comment, US taken delivery 225M vaccines, administered 171M vaccines. 225-171 = 54M.

Currently US taking delivery \~27M doses per 


That amount expected hold steady perhaps go slightly April May. see ""gap"" start increase without commensurate increase deliveries, would sign US starting tilt towards supply demand. We'll almost certainly see next 4-8 weeks, think we're yet. disaster vaccines full stop, especially way governments handled this. honest instead trying cover up. fantasy? masks I'm quitting. go fully remote forever role.  might better thanks natural immunity. 

Not really like getting tested see antibodies preexisting infection getting vaccine. likely two groups overlapping supply ramps availability opens larger groups. intelligent comments get downvoted, usual got first Pfizer shot last Thursday. I'm looking forward second shot - lump throat pain swallowing within fifteen minutes shot (which get worse went home), got itchy over, arm got itchy raised bumps, waves hot chills, injection site swelled up. everything went away except red bumps, still there, Benadryl four hour's time. 

Since afternoon shot, I've felt rejuvenated slightly hyper/euphoric - FEEL REALLY GOOD type good. sense smell seems super acute. think due relief getting vaccine, something's definitely changed. I've read symptoms people long haul covid get better vaccine, knowledge covid, idea sense smell would change. 

Aaand - check CDC daily post vaccine website, indicate reactions time vaccine. believe immediate side effects undercounted. second shot I'll sitting fingers crossed next EpiPen case throat hurt swallow/have lump ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ would wanna live crap area jobs though  much tbh. it’s far easier you’re already place. 

And clear, absolutely advocating office everyday policy find reactions extreme - they’re thinking productivity socialization sort binary thing. colleagues suck, maybe want former colleagues suck, it’s likely problem colleagues. Well guess explains you’re stuck 40K/year. Half/half good me, get work done. Save hour commute get play music working. 2/3 split good read? said US government can't force use, colleges able to. Never said same. left wing authoritarians saints? company work trying send people back last fall. tried explain reasonable leave three kids home day expectation school work unsupervised. 

Being home flexible schedule makes work-life balance much easier. There's reason 95% company full time remote since nothing public. politics propaganda. think side refrain using it? Bless $600 week Tolls. live Long Island commute white plains, NY. It’s nuts. last year feels like I’ve making ton money...because I’m spending cash gas, tolls, wear tear Rule number 1 internet: feed trolls! It’s also recommended mast cell patients even haven’t reacted ingredient before. Mast cell diseases cause allergic reactions anything time, mRNA vaccines may higher risk that, new little data specific interaction. Didn’t realize already spread :( need Diverting doses states significant backlog Michigan address situation. Sounds like vouching hybrid situation around. I’m university student us also agree. doesn’t make sense anymore. difference would new leader make? would do? back point though, ps government recommending wear masks, vast majority people seen wearing masks.

That's true. I'm going Jamaica end May family. We're vaccinated, limited contact people, 5/6 us working in-person throughout entire pandemic. Last May original date postponed it. We've saving 2 years (3 now) since first big trip together family. 

I'm sorry I'm going feel bad UK _just_ got this!?!?  Yeah, sounds like syncope me. Sometimes symptoms described completely faint. 34% high. Would thought more.  Biggest take away. 

Trump administration signed contract vaccine companies US government cannot export. Biden Administration tried renegotiate companies far refused. got vaccinated NYC yesterday too! I'm super optimistic. see cases could possibly go anywhere adults vaccinated 45% antibody positivity rate. Weather help too. exchange commute mom 12 hour days 6 days week now.  Surprised low  reading post made angry triggered kind PTSD.

Having worked productive company multiple floors tech people engineers, single floor sales people...

The fucking sales admin staff would constantly come bother us useless shit. main meeting room floor. 
We realised little us went lunch went way 1 hour towards 2 hours break.

We getting calls texts one idiots went back car change shirts going back office. who’s say they’re find job field let stay home. I’d also think there’s ton people would thank job opening. Seriously? Spain lift ban giving 65s? said Texas lifting mask mandate horrible idea, head spinning shown data yesterday- Texas great since mandate lifted. feel better? Second shot tomorrow. Moderna prefer ability both. home work space also home relax space, 3 straight months working home, got hard enjoy spending 14 hours one room. Assless chaps would appropriate! I’d go border closed. could probably get I’d quarantine 2 weeks even though I’m vaxxed.  think conversations people making decisions saying everyone wants vaccine vaccinated, mandates end. downplaying Europe mostly socialist, Brazil right wing populist candidate exaggerating problems. Thank you! know that’s accurate amount, cannot live 2500/month allowance rent taxes, straight spoiled. 2500 taxes people enjoy before. point still stands. b.1.1.7 3 minute commute office living small town, short drive. done years, entertain anything needed 30min commuting. 2 hours daily, costs aside, would nope fuck situation fast. yet taught Soviet system wildly ineffective full bloated waste... figure many months pay spent gas. That's media blows everything proportion. read it, says spike outlier, I'm sure amount cases considered outlier link. Could help interpret it? need categories broken separately. Covid spread beaches. Well least it’s biological 2006 Tsunami. Clearly, there's agenda get rid Bolsanaro. Cases seem peaked already there; 7-day average already going (of course, deaths usually delayed couple weeks).

If look happened Manaus variant took couple months ago, cases built quickly, started falling high speed they'd reached peak (presumably people risk infection already caught it).

The thing might happen across country, albeit regional variation. agree. friend works software starting new role right pandemic hit. supposed work DC, living mid west taking new job. They’re still paying DC salary despite living ~50% cheaper area. may outlier though. also live Midwest I’m good side line call post-pandemic? think theory works hit people don’t want vaccination vaccines waste. Yea teaching different model office jobs. Teaching, especially school aged children hardly ever done remotely good arguments done person. Accounting? much. Reality check: Peru [more twice usual number past year, still massive outbreak. Imagine US never implemented restrictions.. overblown flu kill least additional year's worth people uncontrolled. wife quit announced moving back office. 

She found new work home job neither us going back office bullshit. want nothing office. broken point look new employment forced back office Move Midwest... everybody California dreaming apparentlyz Biden voted nothing significant changed. He's still keeping wars going, building wall, keeping kids border locked cages...the serious problems leave building. lol One buddy department. lives 4 blocks away office past year wife dog working home 1 bedroom apartment.

I understand would want back office full time. side one talking this:

Let's say make 100k/yr job LA, company says remote they'll cut pay line cost living decide live. let's say choose Austin - CoL 66% LA, could say salary 66k, don't. say 77k. happens end happier actually take home money company happier pay less. 

I understand factors play here, top view, looks like win/win. as? fuck thinking?! That's absurd. company issue, were. whackiest thing would expect middle managers actually useful wfh need wrangle work little more. move... right? Isn’t Republican model? Push poor people cities grew in. anything shows ridiculously harder people grew us..

Think it.. house Florida would cost 100,000 90s. lot without house demand 900,000. future generation experience “American dream” previous generation. work people need onsite week so. bummed thinking I'd go three different guys team said would always go guys.

Every one kids. going destroy dense urban cities commuting saving people pretty penny, mention eating much needing many work clothes. Get place spare room work extra money saved. 2%

I'm one them. I'm really looking forward getting back office... miss separation work home life.


I enjoy commute morning, seeing sun come year looking visually stunning landscapes part drive. enjoy chance unwind way home listening podcasts. never take highways... always driving rural route favor grinding bumper-to-bumper traffic.



I miss interaction colleagues, going lunch myriad different places, meeting friends catch up.


Unlike many speculating, love wife son... live crappy apartment tiny house.


I also care less savings... trivial me. fact we've donated we've saved various charities past year, would spent anyway... people need help.


Yep... crazy sounds, simply enjoy work... like company work for... love life. I'm looking forward return normal... close get.  r/thatACTUALLYhappened. Dang. got johnson johnson :( Same. nature job work it’s sent us, solicitation us, unpredictable downtime. Even office typically spending hours day reading books phone surfing Web. much more. don’t know tell bosses “I cannot anymore productive office, I’ll watching much phone Netflix office years, one ever noticed.” I'm happy say covid company acquired, guaranteed flexible work arrangement. got basically work home much little like. Looking forward it. Yes OP stating go immunity one instant full herd immunity next. point even full herd immunity, they're still really great shape Well, THAT'S surprise! I’m one 2%. I’m millennial, 2 kids, wife, love life, great relationship family, big house, good salary, direct reports work office, 35 minute commute. work home 3 months last year soul crushing depressing experience. great eat meals family see throughout day, work, though seemingly same, felt somehow less important/less real. missed commute really “me time” get regularly. really missed office/desk! can’t replicate workspace well home. went back full time office first day allowed it. half employees still working home. It’s perfect don’t see many coworkers still get go office. don’t like socializing fewer coworkers office better opinion. think companies revert back traditional in-house centralized work-at-the-office model. It’s they’ve known long time they’ll want exert managerial control lost WFH. B117 that's spreading here. Probably reasons one knows sure. Vaccination rate similar lot states. think ""slowly"" growing surrounding Midwest states maybe small spike next weeks. last year around time fall went southern states. Hopefully last surge. We've seeing mostly 30-50 yr old non vaccinated admitted hospital seems confirm vaccine working well. Pandemic fatigue Kent variant think. Really can’t blame area region teaching in? March 2020 year intermittent schooling! drives work NYC? That’s one best things city car drive work. That's thought! felt like I'd heard SEVERE allergies counter indicating COVID vaccine, I'm far doctor sure. Yeah really stay home sick get subway go work help Ah yeah, let edit second part. 1/3 population gotten one dose though according CDC tracker Bosonaro, like Trump, enabler virus. way describe it. wonder point becomes genocidal; many die? Birx seemed place number US result Trump GOP lead states 400,000. Kind shocker anywhere near accurate. Canada, next door US 23,000 deaths, 10% US population, US performed equally Canada, would meant 230,000 deaths, half 500,000+ reality. 

If China, would understand wipe US future. would require even one gun. abhorred commute - leaving sunrises, arriving wish dinner, often skipping dinner go gym without feeling sick

I love everyone office socializing, moment much team longer located within state (30%) full time onsite would resume would lonely. don’t see point much anymore driving hour office get faceless call home

I can’t afford food office located that’s time spend prepping little free time cover costs guys introverted. 12 years easily say somewhat socialization time wastes saved job one occasion. hate office life, would go back office part time actual.offoce 4 walls door, cube life me. distracting takes much time morning commute, etc.. though used life pandemic working home office atleast part time since mid 2015. includes past 3 jobs had. current job, office 3 days week home 2 days week flex time work home sometimes desired. pandemic hit, took opportunity offered back December give office full time teleworker, helps boss literally lives side country everyone department lives different cities states. really need office anyway weekly zoom meetings still see others faces get know other. guess point absolutely see people like working home, everyone sure makes alot peoples lives easier especially kids school, saves much time needing spent driving around place place. me, since working home atleast part time last 6 years, absolutely requirement flexibility take new job. think depending industry in, companies opposed it. incase anyone wondering, work business development Healthcare industry. data wrong. I’ll include link something published today shows 62 cases 18 deaths. Agreed. Osterholm nailed previous predictions past waves wonder seems touch reality time around. Maybe he’s maximally pessimistic always happened correct way lean past waves commented? original comment says nothing vaccination. came purely political/ideological hint inquiry vaccination. Every day numbers get better better smartest way vaccinate sever common vectors exponentially spread virus. absolute certain example schools. Due high vector spread shutdown. Vaccinating someone that's safe home, go ,is going get spread COVID-19 wasted vaccine many greater risk. 

Someone that's forced work like teacher daycare workers forced work even school shutdowns environment significant higher chance getting COVID-19 passing others. teacher infect student, his/her family and/or student bring COVID-19 home infect others. 

That's schools closed. blindly vaccinating people based solely age best approach. Vaccinating senior LTC environment smart environment extremely high risk (this environment largest contributor senior deaths) Ontario. would better eliminate COVID-19's ability spread, protecting front line workers. 

There shared risk, elderly. result severe illness people communities. risk developing severe disease outcomes COVID-19 people: 

* older adult (increasing risk decade, especially 60 years) 
* age chronic medical conditions, including:

lung disease

heart disease

high blood pressure

diabetes

kidney disease

liver disease

dementia

stroke   

* age immunocompromised, including those:

with underlying medical condition, cancer

taking medications lower immune system, chemotherapy

* living obesity (BMI 40 higher) Lot people die cars too. middle age younger per hour chance death driving significantly higher per hour chance death covid19.   shit work depending arrange meals barely feels like fasting still eat large meals - sometimes larger might want even tried lost. 

I bet people appreciate trying though. I’m glad don’t work corporate office environment. job allows time socialize work make lots fun friends way. It’s job lot time functioning. wouldn’t enjoy job sit work day make brief small talk every then.  understand businesses dont get able nap 3pm great incentive efficient. Pfffftttt hahaha

I'm sure 34% would rather quit go back work pre pandemic

Saying 2 diff things show proof MMR vaccination could move dorm 30 years ago. understand anyone thinks there's massive legal precedent this. Make sure take zinc (zycam, etc) vitamin D3. suggested others say doesn’t work. Might help anxiety bc it’s least something control actively  really any. patients suspected severe allergies PEG (one vaccine ingredients) discussion pharmacy team still recommended get vaccine. Pregnant people get it, immunocompromised people get it, people risk factors clotting get it, every condition make people hesitant vaccines actually increase risk much Covid. office rotating schedule months, 2 team office every day week. translates office 1 day week 8 hour shift. 

The kicker sit desk office day literally shit could couch. Somehow office makes difference upper management. 

I know going back 8 hours day 5 days week point, I’ve asked flexibility management older boomers extremely old school. fringe benefits yeah, going back going SUCK hard don’t see leaving wss 1 day wfh covid. love fully remote want go back. Unfortunately old school mentality top still butts seats. lost people didnt want go back office saw coming. I'm hoping flex schedule know based employee engagement surveys bulk company too. fight hard get one day home, kept sane. get lot work done home, say, much less tired. PC better home less time waiting catch up, space desktop. 

I'm admin going mount fight though see get people WFH long term occasional meetings office, holding hope based initial indicators.  fair looked colleagues ceo would trusted work home vs take naps? understand people wanting sub flooded. want see everyday, one thread fine. Nope: said EUA good enough allows employers mandate based that. reason think also allow public universities mandate it. same. Might well reddit good you. got first dose Moderna due second dose week half. 

I mild headache, chills small fever getting it, felt fine next morning. 

A friend mines sister got symptoms second dose. Flu like symptoms couple days fine.  high level resistance future surges

That's kind herd immunity means, no? probably managers adapting well think inevitable people slack bit. they're also commuting 1-2hrs day. count 8hrs + commute ""real"" time spent working, without commuting spread amount work greater period time still productive before. also think people productive general they're stressed get every morning, drag office, deal everyone else, whole time dreading ride home, coming home exhausted, something could've easily done living room. Plus there's still plenty jobs *require* go physical location work nature work, people could work home getting way choice matter. might worse, prioritize first shots? sure though. refuse commute anymore. There's good reason drive office work computer day internet connection home. Hm. Suit messaging populace. like it. I'm contracted muralist gorgeous office space...building downtown, 3 stories, 350 employees...I'm one usually! crazy much $$ must be. lot places upgrading environments absence...making fun/exciting work new perks employees anticipating/dreading coming back office. us amazing families friends live nearby. family recently moved several continents away remaining ones I'd rather toss cliff waste effort trying give emotional support. draining.

Is fun therapeutic chat people ecru then. Inquiring vaccination status Palestinians Israel isn’t appropriate r/Coronavirus??? name anarchy? 

In area terrible teacher professor norm, maybe affluent area something? Honestly bad conspiracy start want target red districts. “Newsome withholding vaccines Republicans.”

Instant spike vaccine interest.

Your welcome.

Vaccinated conservative. Higher management knows. whole reason middle managers exist one time scream team people individually. Middle managers dont understand roles wont fearful esp team performs. one cares get team perform. could easily per-state passports someone travels state without one, they're treated passport verify drivers license confirm come state w/o one.

It need cover every state.  pretty simple.  another non-cash benefit justify lower wages. Companies start adjusting salary home zip code. may true would surprised survives layoff properly socialized. balance ruthless efficiency personal good naturedness best worlds. Well got there. jobs/careers WFHers do? 

Computer based jobs outside scope reference, interested. Good. get rid bullshit religious exemption loophole too, [there valid religions actually forbid Misleading title. There’s big difference looking new job quitting. look new job perform current job. thought Japan virus control? wonder changed. said curious, say smart definitely think answer mixed work schedule. still see value going office five days week. Plus it’s obvious happy workers productive. Long island new york city 34%? they’re sick. don’t put one they’re sick Wow. boss loves WFH much do. Pre-pandemic, needed, like kids sick. talked us splitting work week one us always there. (We employees can't WFH.) think pandemic given us chance prove productive home. Everybody expects Pfizer vaccine fully licensed summer. personal stuff talk about? 1-on-1s excluding chronic interrupter good. experts say institutions well within legal rights require returning students fully immunized coronavirus, although schools required law grant exemptions medical religious beliefs offer reasonable accommodations.

with collages offering distance learning want vaccine still accomodated. get religion exemption. hope make provide prooff religion forbids &amp; actual followers religion, claiming religious comes vaccine breaking major rules faith. Also 5HTP otc SSRI deaths continue decline like cases still rise, could things start open up?

That's good question. best guess might reserve whole opening thing restrictions again. mean that, mean reduce numbers people going stores. AZ clotting issue adverse impact getting EU &amp; much rest world vaccinated variants swamp efforts. 
0.0002% clots &amp; 40 cases, 2 deaths. COVID-19, especially variants, much prevalent &amp; lethal. r/politics way It’s easy too. offer employees flex remote days track like PTO. don’t think that’s true, mean 1/3 1/4 16+ Americans, respectively? neighbor didn’t want get vaccine, vent due covid. early 60s. 😩

It scared antivax neighbors enough getting vaccine. Whattttt one get this? wonder something New York City 8.5
 million people next biggest city 3.8 million. People arent going start moving hopes companies do

Theres reason California rich midwest isnt Start offering vaccines biggest clubs drinks reward call ""shots shots"" Moderna seems slightly higher chance side effects, ""unpleasantness"" seems lower Pfizer observations far talking friends family. me, Moderna day feeling fatigued sore. wife Pfizer seemed deal pain (in particular armpit moderna seem much) well higher fever.  family members pfizer dealt nausea...whereas shot little nausea, discomfort.

I realize scientific anecdotal, hopefully little reassurance getting gentler two. Lol get outta here. People like ruin rest us. Wrong sub dude.  post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Probably bad batch. Something similar happened San Diego months ago Moderna vaccine. cleared rest given out. I'm pretty sure ""checked out"" high school, long covid. passed class never went giving teacher bag m&amp;ms last day so...... dads 'grin bear it' mentality made lose respect actually. loyally worked bank 10 years every 3 years cut salary half, took clients away never took PTO personal day working 12 hours day. eventually fired him. look shit shake head. also wants work dies. Im FIRE, yo. Oh also ive making nore money since around 25. Sounds like also problem parents need help solve highly unlikely. I’m pretty sure vaccines 100% effective death trial.  many countries unions norm physicians. Three come mind news recently Britain, Kenya Myanmar. doctors strike places well almost invariably include 'measures public good' demands rather classic wage demands. Myanmar prominent resistance military junta. doctors strike invariably make provisions emergency service. 

Medicine certainly changed years always better. doctors unionize strikes possible sign actually employees solo practitioners. USA 15% doctors solo practice. terms corporatization medicine USA truly 'heart darkness'. countries doctors usually facing government bureaucrats across bargaining table. 

I'm sure laws vary across USA, places legal barriers physicians joining union. [Union American Physicians existence decades. Thanks info, I'll look call doctor get chance. Good know likely non-issue though. feel hungry thirsty, although admittedly eat drink much shot. I've given blood dozen times felt faint first time too. I'll see doctor says make sure eat drink plenty second dose even feel particularly like so. Hello I'm looking information regarding sinusthrombosis vaccination Astrazeneca. searchfunction threads? 
Anyway , want know, cases sinusthrombosis occur? first second shot?
I can't find information it! somebody help me? neurodivergent human struggles public masks incredibly well soul crushingly exhausted labor, hope seeing popularity comments post. WFH bees knees. Lol wrong transfer gtfo *cries Ontarian* ton confidence teachers jobs, managed, evaluated somebody finish education program. Sorry say Brazil population 211M. 4000 huge number proportionally, appx. 1 50.000.
We population 9.6M 250 dead almost every day now, top 300. 1 36.000.
Despite 25% people vaccinated despite strict lockdown measures. I'm looking CDC's definition, literal embodiment COVID-19's definition. 0 days. long quarantine traveling?

0 days.  Yeah, absolutely. risks COVID generally far greater risk blood clots.

If 1/1000 younger people dying COVID, 1/250,000 get blood clots, statistically makes sense vaccinate. think anything it, asked pregnant planning get pregnant within next 6 weeks, assumed time scale second dose. But, typing sounds little strange like pharmacist warned risks getting pregnant time. Small gathering vaccinated individuals = 1000 less ;) still leases Work isn’t social club, you’re make money. Draw line work/life becomes much easier. People need social interaction office setting need find friends places. said, friendships workplace happen - isn’t purpose “at work” shouldn’t be. 

Those lacking socialization using excuse justify going back office ruining everyone else life outside work. It’s meaningless side-ism I’m sure many people would love job covid death count hasn’t bothered much recently, become much supportive reopening. may morbid point 80% deaths didn’t wait vaccine. I’m split good not.

On one hand, skilled people don’t want live NYC, SF, LA, high cost living areas move still work companies based major cities. people work whomever want two-thirds three-quarters price someone lives major city still comparatively earn net savings company.

Alternatively hurts people want need live major cities. spouse NYC healthcare worker need earn NYC wage ER nurse can’t work remotely.

Everything life comes positives negatives, different. may take adjusting first society figure out. solution may case-by-case. worker wants $X finds someone somewhere willing pay, doesn’t lowers price. Amen that. could convinced flex discretion. That's unusually long amount time vaccine side effects. Can't hurt talk doctor case illness rather side effects. hope feel better soon! It’ll long time guys unfortunately. Yeah im worried “Don’t”, he’s talking death risk above.

Let translate something simpler. He’s saying “your risk death COVID last winter higher risk dying vaccine, even healthy 20 year old. Also there’s negative side effects virus top too” doctor, ask doctor, take medical advice strangers, sounds like vasovagal response. Google [vasovagal want info. Basically, reflex causes sudden blood pressure drop risk fainting.


It's fairly common, especially blood draws vaccinations. Make sure fell fed hydrated warn nurse/pharmacist/whoever second dose need sitting may faint. people especially prone, people random reaction never again. really think we're going back 30+ minute commute lifestyle anymore. People work office going live downtown. rest going WFH.

Too many people saw crap employers put us through. Can't put cat back bag. Ya don’t say blows mind we’re creating mRNA vaccines viruses haven’t even moved humans yet. I’d rather die full time WFH COVID death perfectly fine, one singular binary?

No, there’s things long COVID, unable taste months brain fog months. There’s permanent lung damage hospitalization.

It’s death. Yeah waitint EMA approval. learning zoom boring, can’t improve it. Teachers don’t recognize that, arrogant. nah. saw post history, realizing type person I'm dealing with. ✌ Nothing americans america. share idiots stuff like that. get control say stay south. Nah left really doesn’t. California set fully reopen June 15th. Shortly whole population eligible vaccine. “left” also passing stimulus try keep economy moving wants expand mental health care. sure you’re talking about. got new boss end 2020. First thing force everyone back office full time. gone downhill there. We're bleeding staff, directors quit fired coming back, half senior staff gone, managers bailing. help new boss's decisions gotten problematic time goes on. I'm looking, preferably full time WFH. 

I never realized normal exhausted time. well rested, working home. Much less stressed. Much productive.   Point proven. Yes, getting r 6 1.2 1.1 still huge shift. near beach area San Diego walking shop realized left wallet car. turned around started jogging back car get it. woman walking dog turned around hear coming, screamed, picked dog, sprinted nearest driveway get away me. wearing mask. missing anything, currently. Apparently HCoV-NL63 uses ACE 2 receptors infect people SARS Cov 2 SARS viruses use. 

Also HCoV-NL63 jumped bats humans thousand years ago, similar virus causing current pandemic. vaccines probably protect it’s similar. much kids. half school failing, clearly school method. Yeah i’m sure we’re (US) afraid of? witnessed person walk stall Laguardia airport earlier leave without washing hands clearly threat actually know much accelerate April May. Currently around 2.5 million per day average. 

I'd wish would vaccinating speed country. currently half that, probably speed mid-April earliest surely end April. might giant test pharma company see two populations do... sounds like got wrong memo paid *get things done* instead chatting day away. Good. need job. Ontario going 3rd lockdown 3rd wave takes control enough vaccines left chat. Lord knows love boss, driving NUTS she’s someone “craves” socializing says. walls job suck meetings always awkward use damn near whisper voices. hope stay remote much 3/5 days. Tired paying commute sometimes paying park car. Sucks ass! Except plant caught error, J&amp;J.

And previous article clearly stated actually factory always recorded - can't trust paper tail. forget 100% anyone real commutes want plethora shitty drivers back roads clog mandatory commutes.  Someone please let know understand correctly; effective vaccine, fewer people need order achieve herd immunity, right?

So like vaccine 60% effective need immunize 85% people 90% effective need vaccinate 55%? what's going here? People don’t know better.  know R value falls 1. non-psychopaths ones get promoted. 

(I weird feeling work company me, nervous laugh) wrong. fact enjoy working remotely ever wished started sooner, one whole year 'vacation' home working unreal. although stable income get give that's enough get going King, ever forget empire strikes back I'm outside LA least 90% people walking/running/biking alone wear one here. family town come back walk grab masks said felt uncomfortable ones without on. wife hike lot every single person hiking trails wearing one, minimum one chin pull every time pass someone else. second dose population close first dose population? run willing people? I'm going trip next week actually.

They endangering people, yes, well **majority** Americans chance get shot yet.  Issues Japan need exposed world more, otherwise country never improves thanks rightists defending “good old tradition”. respect decision, safe trip. trust plant **they caught error**.

A GMP manufacturing facility like widget factory, literally everything tracked traced. Good believe science statistics huh? fuck downvoted here?

Probably sub gotten little... odd lately. sure *that* is. anyone experienced known side effects, week 2nd vaccine dose? got Pfizer. 

Felt typical side effects 1st dose. 2nd dose well, went away day 3. 

However, symptoms coming back every 2 3 days. Chills, fever, aching, diarrhea, etc. (No arm soreness. harder regular body temp. problem think country bunch groups r value. average r&lt;1, still transmission among particular groups r still that's think correct student's behavior teacher summer? *most* optimistic estimate I’ve seen “in second half year.” agree. I'm ""get business"" type learn slow way required minutes pleasantries. sports probably I'm VP yet, never one. job? plentiful WFH jobs. many companies starts push going back office, pool available WFH jobs would decrease would harder find them. employees wouldn’t quit unless find replacements. Yeah see holds alternative going bankrupt homeless.

Businesses management particular little reason give control person offices offer them. ICU admission higher ever entire quick google says they're requiring Fall, FDA full approval.

[Full vaccine approval normally takes five ten years. rumor FDA approval COVID vaccines may come early seems optimistic Uhhh EU exported doses administered (about 100 million now) meanwhile US exported single dose, ""loaned"" 4M vaccine approved 2 neighbours. Username doesn’t check out. California, currently lowest test-positivity rate nation. Look, pretty much every part country least one terrible surge now. coming years, I'm sure rigorous studies dissecting impact different actions different governments different parts world. Right soon make certain proclamations one way another--including justifying Texas's removal mask mandate.

Japan compared neighbors others similar(ish) cultures. Korea, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong. Perhaps Vietnam Singapore. Japan looks horrible compared peers. Two way quarantine travel NZ Australia opens next week wonder hygiene really factor. We've seen studies show there's 1 10,000 chance surface transmission. mention fact almost restrooms Japan soap men wash hands.

This may total quackery theory masks also fact Japanese people less intimate also meet fewer friends/family countries. common couples meet twice month Tokyo, friends Tokyo see parents (who also live Tokyo) times year. also think way people Japan interact (no hugging, hand-shaking, etc.) may factor. someone lives Israel confirm 12th month everything going back normal little restrictions. Italy added Israel 'allowed countries' list. first country outside Europe/EU included! 

I've following travel restrictions closely boyfriend lives another continent almost cried joy country almost done vaccinations means near future might add too. breakthrough Yea, feel like really complacent. There's really nothing stopping another lockdown people fuck again. Yeah like, Fauci probably outranks guy AIDS crises COVID never said thing. We've gotten lot supply March narrative Canada entirely failing vaccine rollout still seems there. February awful us. However, March started ramp much although we're behind US, UK, Isreal, countries, actually bad compared developed countries overall. April May see huge increase supply. correct also factor natural immunity. Generally speaking less likely vaccinated probably less adherent rules anyway probably caught disease point. Early pretty crap actually benefit. sure percentages kids immunity though. Yeah, point people don’t understand difference rate vaccination rate change rate vaccination. It’s like difference speed acceleration. It’s HS level math everyone whined said “I’ll never need this”. jealous Get tested antibodies Yes, believe always concern Bill Gates donated millions vaccinating poorer parts world. risk working, risk relying one vaccine, could run unforeseen downsides manufacturing issues. fair, ""lockdown"" no-no word/concept post-WW2 Germany Lmao I'm disagreeing point. stated use word slow describe due inherent bias. I'm stumped lexical choice suggesting purpose, long day. long story begins man crucified got this:

They’re seeing seeing average citizens, things getting simultaneously worse better, depending locale, situation, etc. It’s good news bad news message don’t despair, please don’t stop caring (for haven’t yet) could tip scales either direction here. irresponsible behavior create major road bumps slow positive track already on. 32 first AZ jab. less worried getting second jab. Much concerned run bike way get blood clots may arise it. Zero community transmission? Back vaccine queue you!

That's feeling Oz anyways 0.001% risk serious side effects though (1 100,000 people). Yes, again, that's conditional upon Sputnik V approved EMA first, makes sense; all, let's say Sputnik V fails gain EMA authorization - would rather pointless begin manufacturing point. Amazing!

Germany like others mentioned. strict privacy laws insanely archaic government system willing change flexible, entire crisis basically showing German efficiency myth really belong sub? tabloidy. giving ""medical records"". giving reports recoveries specifics vaccine numbers. small price pay getting pandemic quickly. Runkbulle Runkbulle That's experts believe may happen, that's totally businesses indeed want sacrifice profit provide safety. federal government going set verification process, believe I've read New York California considered kind app. 

I read bar Denver decided serve customers possess CDC vaccination card, that's right. bars nearby glad accept customers one. Runkbulle Good We’re clear locked hard fast, we’ve kept social distancing rules needed. didn’t much chance spread here. result, government isn’t fussed rushing vaccine fast rest world way go schedule catches up. 

We’re fine though. get mine next week! That’s entire US lockdown strategy. think that's stretch, fine, opinion. think inevitable people slack bit

Well fact, seems opposite, we're observing 20% increase production (in France) since people started working home. See thing is, they'd normally take legal break (we're due 5mn break per hour, legally, minimum 20mn pause one go per day) chat informally around coffee machine, outside building smokers. remote work? Who's gonna take 20mn roaming around aimlessly? generally take minutes break, time go loo, heat cup, they're back laptops.

I've personnally force husband taking dog short walks day, could get legal break. heading towards burnout set it, much better now, wake middle night anymore.

So, no, ""inevitable people slack bit"", suprisingly, tend overwork themselves. think one missing point you. coronavirus safety measures like wearing masks moderating openings political disputes. based science look see worked effectively China, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, etc. 

People pick states due fact high concentration folks claimed virus hoax, believed lies reality TV gameshow host scientists, voted massively corrupt state politicians embroiled scandals, etc. impossible achieve year vast majority countries. confirm, clubbing past 2 weekends TLV... feels almost ""normal"" including interaction ppl haha

&amp;#x200B;

It's still bit weird feeling tight spaces immense amount ppl (without masks), raised anxiety - far good, things seem getting back normalcy fuckers deserved it. didn’t even slightest smear vegemite behind ears. let’s talk dickhead tried marmite. night curfew means interact day. maybe half percent reduction interaction nothing. There's denying restrictions effecting numbers surprised see little changed schools went back. Cases rose 18s age group. Truly shows effective vaccine cases updated including origin regular basis (I tally myself):
 numbers 17/19 new cases India. happening on-going thing. try doubt UK numbers disingenuous.  headline makes sound like Germany asking permission EU politicians buy waiting approval vaccine EMA, independent, non-political agency EU Staring teachers boring without zoom, noticeable students option avoid it. 7 day moving average daily new deaths 809. Lowest since October 20.

It hit low 725 early October right 3rd wave started. Lowest pandemic 525 early July. We're week two away falling first number maybe month second current rate. Learning hard, learning fun. School hard. Mostly stuck 19th century mindset. Except that’s point debate here. We’re talking vaccine rollout slow, we’re talking slow rollout contributes fact Australia can’t open yet. unvaccinated population back normal life, virus starts spread they’re right back lockdown. higher chance dying weekly commute, 'FREELY CHOOSE' walk stairs. 

You FREELY CHOOSE turn like wait another, risk blown way proportion. ***blushes*** Solidarity Europe. 

What reason canada? know guys get vaccines Europe ... sucks US share bit more.  

Europe decided would want make sure country got equal share smaller pie, rather make pie bigger. contact trace speak? Wow wish here!  really die never truly lived? prove kids fully vaccinated every year enroll school, camp, sports leagues, etc. Got - thanks!

Sorry - ask - Arieh Kovler essentially predicted Trump insurrection? I’m sure many vaccine available. talk Israel anymore 


One biggest vaccine sceptic sites internet, zerohedge, mention anymore. 


This website reported things like ""the nurse took vaccine dies"". search online, find traffic accident something Got - thanks!

Sorry - ask - Arieh Kovler essentially predicted Trump insurrection? bad live. does? Learning deem 'useless facts' high priority list.

Why not? Kids generally tend like learning. also tend like useless things. school system fail motivate fail present facts way engaging? Sure believe UK variant probably proven infectious labs. made significant difference real world? Cases seen plummeting vast majority Western world. Sample size much smaler second dose, least UK cases first dose far. פוגצאמפ, אפילו Right? wild winds change rapidly this. One month great, short month later entire system fire.

You really can't ever relax it. No, can't count numbers right.  might accurate, difference instances coming UK Norway/Germany raises doubts.

More investigation needed see UK missed cases, recorded reasons. No, AZ vaccine given health workers Norway. persons died young known underlying conditions. Everyone continues bring birth control neglecting fact alternatives oestrogen-based birth control individuals, people use birth control FREELY CHOOSE one want, KNOWING risks. AstraZeneca vaccine, people given active choice alternative, instead often put end queue turn down. Sure, still turn risk, won’t immediately offered alternative, nothing preventing next time you’re offered vaccine yet AstraZeneca. Eh went phase 3 trial reached primary end point. paid premium safe bet. couple months ago read canada purchased enough vaccines vaccinate population 5 times over. happened deliveries? Yes, I've following expat FB groups Vietnam, local outbreak would completely lock cities, one could enter leave. couple months ago outbreak traced back foreigners, tested every foreigner one city. relevant TED talk Sir Ken Robinson

There three different ones, mean particular?

[Do Schools kill escape education's Death Learning German government negotiating rights manufacturer germany? lousy workers company, guess Oh yeah. UK Office National Statistics estimated [54.5% seropositivity week ending March Add almost 4 weeks vaccination there's decent chance UK close herd immunity threshold now. 

But tighter restrictions also help cases drop faster. EU Western country/institution export! 

News reporting Australia received 700,000 AZ vaccines UK secret, deliveries far back February. UK government acknowledge want backlash population neck deep covid then.

Just interesting development see backlash UK really well month Control. gave much freedom fight COVID, clearly many government remiss relinquish newfound power.

And, again, masks nothing. amount whiny entitled basement dwellers hilarious interesting way looking it, entirely disagree; however, context derived directly bias language. slow accurately describes process, ascribes (as mention) agency cause. lack suggests agency cause. case, neutrality statement creates bias and, hence, would use word. limited roll would suggest representative. Especially since doubt given higher risk groups first. mean, noted every possible outlet point... NPR even extended coverage today. Kids hit much harder new variants legaxy strains. 

But go get started... would've guessed?! theres slow theres Scomo's Slomo first one. look graph [here], green section recovered people. 

That green section getting smaller recovered people get vaccinated. can't see graph, compared previous daily graphs raw number 'recovered' people dropping. 

Add blue sections (= least one dose) today get 56.3% think independent evidence suggests pretty good too. can't find link German study think positive enough German government enter talks producing Germany. comorbidities 99.90%+ chance recover intubated. That's I've noticed math behind nr reports. think may coronavirus year ago, anyway find didn’t? went Calera get shot making appointment giving anyone showed filled paperwork. Thats depressing, mention time spent work preparing work. Insane.
I online business atm get job future get something close home 8h max. Couldnt waste life road, others mentioned, statistically riskiest thing day Similarly I've felt everyone given Trump credit vaccine, even though situation obviously simple. Maybe would screaming rooftops get vaccine followers would take it. Vaccine producers adhering vaccine targets. lie lot kiss bosses ass here. what's excuse Vietnam?

If anything, I'm actually working longer hours now, adding would normally evening commute. I'm also snacking active less. need change that. trustworthy many countries there, say really. Graphs near avoid office go in, get nothing done.

Government secretly flown 700,000 doses AstraZeneca vaccine Australia despite shortage jabs UK, claimed.

Australia’s vaccine rollout boosted shipment Britain kept quiet avoid controversy, according reports Sydney Morning Herald Age.

Matt Hancock, Health Secretary, said last month vaccine shortages Britain mean first appointments jabs booked April amid growing chaos supplies.

But newspapers claim 717,000 doses sent Australia manufactured UK rather Europe, widely believed. 

Australia entered vaccine row European Union recent weeks bloc placed tough export controls jabs.

The Australian government received 300,000 UK-made doses Sydney Airport February 28, one month EU set curbs limiting vaccines sent abroad.

At time, government said shipment come “overseas”. single vaccine sent Brussels Australia, newspapers claim.

Last month, Italian government blocked export 250,000 doses AstraZeneca vaccine Australia.

Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, says country owed 3.1 million doses vaccine Wednesday demanded Brussels approve shipments.

The UK sent vaccines overseas territories, including Gibraltar Falkland Islands, Australia thought country receive AstraZeneca jabs made British factories.

A senior Whitehall official told newspapers shipments Australia hinder UK rollout, one quickest world.

Downing Street respond requests comment Wednesday.

Dr Brendan Murphy, secretary Australian department health, told Sky News last month Britain “helped us lot”.

Asked whether European Commission would reconsider position blocking vaccine exports, spokesperson said: “Since implementation export authorisation system, Australia received one million doses vaccines EU.”

On Thursday, Australia said plans stop distributing AstraZeneca's vaccine Europe's drug regulator found possible links rare blood clots. Dude straight wasted life. ballpark time spent commuting around 500 days total last 17 years. That's year half life can't get back could something else with. Thanks this.

Meanwhile ""night curfews"" ""weekend lockdowns"" mask mandates travelling alone car. Shit literally nothing curb spread. :))))))) 

The holy Trinity anti intellectual , crowd pleasing. Agree ask doctor, makes think allergy Cipro would cause issue? Cipro vaccine ingredient? don’t think extended.

Personally think it’s concerning reason shutdown case among guard wasn’t vaccinated. point pretty crazy anyone connected MIQ yet jab.

I think aspect cover fact NZ vaccination program going Bottom line, way early state open up. apparently existence vaccines reason meant open up. matter made way actual bodies yet. swear people believe live video game rules. ""Vaccine developed!"" Everyone INSTACURED! I'm guessing people still talk Israel *a lot*.  then, wait use supply makes government look less good? 

Pfizer/BioNTech doubled week, it’s normal huge increase. Hell, adults remote work checks out. can't imagine kid time... symptom swollen lymphnodes arm got shot. brothers friends felt crappy. Georgia scattered mass vaccination sites rural areas they’ve switched walk well due lower demand.

Yeah half hour. That's San Bernadino OC. deep ceo still hates it. :( showed old.reddit.com listing sort new. remember weeks ago someone claim Germany could ever manage vaccinate 300K per day. glad it’s true. 

Finally supply looking bit better. Another [great chart illustrating effectiveness vaccines real world. 

There undeniably new surge hospitalizations since mid-March. Especially concerning since reporting states majority significantly deadlier B.1.1.7 variant. However, surge basically exist among senior population (who vaccinated). That's frightening thought. Cases 50% capacity. Although say multitude restaurant parking lots pass almost daily basis, well 50% capacity. I'm sure rules enforced. Parking lots pretty much full point pre-pandemic. think they're saying Canadians begging shot enough whilst America making plenty. country allow someone define gender depending feel, going tough tell someone religion isnt valid.

Not really? Gender intrinsic part one experiences world, one's social interactions. Religion optional hobby. mean percentage wise, Canada overtaken Europe amount vaccinations they've done like last week, number still low. Something like 16% got least one dose, covid cases starting going Ontario 100 million Astrazenca doses (so far)

If done 30 million citizens far, 60 million doses allocated. leaves 40 million doses, enough 20 million people.

Probably conveniently remaining 30 50 age bracket.

I suspect may swayed pick specific 30 cut age limit. “We continue see young people need hospitalized unfortunately die disease,""

This BS, everyone knows it. get went 60+ high risk healthy 16 year olds week. 33% 1 shot. Letting healthy teens take spots means older people able get appointments going get sick die. CNN actually shit omg. say anything US primed surge.

I'm sure Fox News MSNBC better ways, course. Yep, schools leading pack: curiosity, technically legal go clubbing without mask, everyone saying screw it, authorities care?  I'm perfectly capable handling social interaction. fact majority work history client-facing. mean need love crammed office bunch people know would probably never choose close to. get enough social stimulation known ""friends,"" radical concept know. That’s false. Pfizer 91% effective SA Like, literally that's 94%... Like, that's literally point fair OP, thought 94% number *two* weeks shot #2. Although, assume second week adds couple percentage points. cases occur first dose? Either way feel like unfair situation, unfortunately trials show risk. understand completely though, I'd really worried too. Hopefully they'll reassuring information time get second dose. neighbors metro Detroit finally took American flag Trump’s name weeks ago. One clients north still flies Trump flag American flag.

I love state, people.... eh. sounds like weak ejaculation They've started ago (the first people get vaccines given Pfizer) supply wholly imported opposed AZ (manufactured locally CSL, Melbourne-based company) quite limited. better get Pfizer switch Novavax, whichever sooner.

Yea amount people losing shit, like never left house before? needed MMR meningitis think hep b Despite making 13% virus population brazilian variant commits 50% crimes don’t good internet. (Location constraint choice. satellite nature work it’s good enough spend half day loading) come office 2020. (Doesn’t bother person office) 
I tell someone come office work talk! People never use talk talk talk talk. socially isolated caused people talk everything. (My HR told us listen rude cause it’s important mental health talk you)

When office goes back avoid 1st weeks, nothing get done cause people need vent lent demand gossip. think 2013 2014 first heard found it. know used 3 4 times 2015 aware. Herd immunity technically nothing event. Anything less herd immunity ""high rates immunity"" something. can't little bit pregnant. all, i.e. South African one responds good current ""leaky"" vaccines. New , dangerous variants emerge via putting enormous pressure virus still allowing mutate. Well thankfully Australia US. US Trump said many things Covid-19 contradictory came believe willing say *anything* long factual. Correct, said high infections. Nothing primed another surge. Garbage CNN again.... Im sure rich countries find way make top money talks pal Gyms barbers aren’t issue. Ontario stupid response. think we’re pretty close shift distribution. suspect next couple weeks we’ll see private sector arrangements made bring vaccines workplaces (e.g. vaccines get delivered factory administered employees course week). little bumpy first, employers want go back way will, problem keeping people. Theres still 2 3 people want go back office. It’s dominant strain nationally. careful. message next week week needs include version of:

""you've waiting turn get vaccinated. turn now. Make appointment.""

Also, choice, go mass vaccination site instead pharmacy. wait Walgreens. would think Walgreens pleasant convenient state county site, reality. guess overseas makes difference. I'd also guess refer regional bank call regional bank 2 different things roommate risking bringing variant Cali.

You know roommate situation. Maybe he's taking precautions, maybe already Covid, maybe he's dual-citizen get vaccinated soon arrives...

Can stop considering fellow human beings walking germs nothing more? dehumanizing! seems location different requirement. wonder used better understand long term protection vaccine added database useless data mean J&amp;J vaccine around 70% effective believe? guess I’m dramatic I’m much pain right don’t want take chances feeling way I'm sure anyone right answer this. India first wave good months Europe US them. expect second wave also couple months late, happened exactly.

I think virus affecting people initial antibodies died. course, gatherings also played role, really fall timeline. protein Sputnik V use? got vaccine think covid serious biz, lot folks don’t. Gonna hard convince need mandates vaccine disease low death rate. 9 11 people treated successfully onsite juice water 

the 2 transported hospital monitoring. UK 8+ million 2nd doses blood clots reported after. 9 11 people treated successfully onsite juice water 

the 2 transported hospital monitoring. anyone got vaccinated Walgreens, give choice Pfizer Moderna tell vaccine getting appointment somewhere? Ah see added interesting point edit! Hm interesting point using methodology cited earlier expect see similar levels diversity countries surrounding israel I'd hypothesis correct, right?

To me, case reality. look surrounding areas, markedly decreased lvls diversity compared israel (see list like). hypothesis Jews many places emigrate israel, contributing diversity. example, Jewish-Indian populations israel.

I think others looking exchange, dispell myth Jews white. contrary, significant populations Nigerian Jews, Moroccan Jews, Indian Jews, many many more. even historic group Chinese Jews ! ethnoreligion group, real diversity friend let tell country: delusional weeb edition Habs Looking Asia's death rates compared Europe North America raises many questions, especially regarding Japan. Yeah, government intervention cultural differences probably play part, Japan absolutely devastated based average age lack robust countermeasures.

The fact Japan regularly much worse flu seasons (per capita) US means social practices necessarily ""better"" containing viruses, Coronavirus much contagious flu, something else must going on. medicines agency would ever claim vaccine totally safe. make superlative comments like that. medicines always risk. must compare usually tiny risk vaccine much larger risk illness. Seems like consensus ""maybe?"". guess, anything, type mask would play major factor. First doses, yes. total doses fully vaccinated people. mean, unless counting Gibraltar, 90% fully vaccinated. Noticed too. Pitiful Georgia legislators spending time creating Jim Crow laws support voter suppression barking Coca Cola, rather focusing pandemic killing hundreds thousands Americans, ensuring constituents vaccinated, insane. Exactly. Tell what's likely, vaccines hundreds millions people used dangerous, certain countries spread antivax misinformation US weaken population. Get tin foil hat on.  cost? 

Oh wait didn’t pay lmao

Seriously tho that’s great both, actually. fact 70% driving close home, **with guard down**, accidents happen close home. They're familiar comfortable roads used things always are, staying attentative new hazards. There's lots interesting studies papers this.

We've got nice weather starting, vaccines rolling alarming rates, we're 70% things almost feeling normal like we're close home, dropping guard getting normal life soon. son 15 1/2. GIVE SHOT ALREADY. They’ll always move goalposts. Every vaccine side effects risks small. nothing legal precedence vaccinations dependent CFR disease see masked people alone cars time Seattle. don’t get it. looks like ship U.S. bottling. seems like European leadership failed. got shot? Isn’t stop getting COVID? opposed forced starve? Israel offered vaccinate Palestinians multiple times refused PA yeah, realized looked card. Parents friend circle essentially said won’t social stop quarantining kids able get vaccine. It’s going considerably longer haul guess. think that’s puts highest second highest % vaccinated group. basically like whole new virus compared we've dealing past year.

some loose standards whole new virus huh? one cares, vaccines stop variants. matters CDC ease vaccinated people we'd rather reopen months early years late (like CDC seems want). comment linking newsweek.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

 Could give examples evidence? vaccines protect mutations? Get vaccinated now. Don’t wait eligible. It’s fairness. It’s getting many people vaccinated possible quickly possible reduce spread virus move us towards herd immunity entire story definition ""fear porn,"" summed by:

With rest world far behind immunizations, virus continue spread mutate, every copy potential spark variation current vaccines able control. odds remain low, experts think, zero.

“I fear one terrible variant come take us back square one,” Ho said.

The odds low ... yet treated inevitable. Lots language like ""for now"" talking vaccination success. argument whiteboard web app cannot move information team members rapidly person session, communication bandwidth restricted. 10 man whiteboard session one person talking time slow hell. literally lose best talent can’t stand work slowly.

If want effective remote work whiteboarding, need split small focus groups fast possible. still isn’t good person session, though. person sessions naturally lend rapid formation dissolution discussions, cross pollination ideas discussions. 5th time's charm (I hope) I'm sorry, good messaging absolutely essential. Let's examine expert opinions normalcy return country: one epidemiologist said optimistically(!) point 2022 semblance normalcy **if** U.K. Israel see cases rise another said ""will allowed meet friends, take walks etc. precautions next several **years**"". 

So excellent vaccines, golden ticket put bullshit behind us, what's messaging? absolutely nothing change restrictions stay long, long time. anyone surprised people reluctant get vaccinated means movement towards normalcy? maaaaaaybe get crumb normalcy next fucking year, that's optimistic? don’t return office already remote, say pandemic blurred line work life unhealthy way. There’s boundaries 8am 5pm. Yeah, missed opportunity there. could patriotic thing unites us fight virus. Damn. I'm getting Sinopharm vaccine work later week, problem country two available COVAX program. top two available astrazeneca vaccine ages 60+ country doctor told us Sinopharm vaccine intended pregnant breastfeeding women. Thats one! Someone know got J&amp;J, passed out, seizure pissed herself. I'd stick Phizer Oh I'm aware... emotional level, would felt better ""felt"" something. It’s exactly unrealistic level nuance social media.

Also true. Point being, vaccines yet FDA approved, school predictions/recommendations somewhat conservative. they’re approved vaccine validation line with, say, meningitis vaccine requirements, it’ll far easier mandate vaccines instead masks.

The article goes little. It’s fair point, imo. Plenty governments sending vaccines non citizens. Even self interested nationalist perspective makes sense vaccinate neighbours. Pretty shit Israel occupiers take land use excuse vaccinate like fault people forcefully evicted vaccinate themselves. gtfoh.

Not vaccinating population living Israeli rule jus extension genocidal policies towards Palestine denying apologists. wearing mask made political, would likely positive trend post-COVID people start wearing masks sick. masks divisive, never happen. vaccine showed adverse/fatal reactions two years post vaccination? Yeah, best idea. Would masks help allergies? gee golly, didn’t know pandemics time limit.

Are stupid? guy referring covid becoming less threat, referring people sick restrictions social animals understanably get restless told year see humans. fact CDC fauci mission force vaccinated people live like unvaccinated person sure inspire lot faith them. Yes, add ~15% people recovered virus. CFR measles vaccines 15%. Covid isn’t anywhere near whole process end end, producing bottling etc shipping out? wonder would call Asymptomatic case medical perspective. 

Is SARS CoV2 infection, come Covid-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019). would argue infected virus, COVID-19. EU USA put export ban, doses shipped elsewhere. fact, believe doses imported EU except Hungary. 

Countries free market minded, like USA, thus demand companies feel forced make use wiggle room EU deliveries try fulfill american ones. Covid hit, critical pull wallet get science funded vaccines pre-ordered. US lead way. EU took wait see attitude. happened.

In contrast, say definitively someone spoken up, happened. happens lockdown 1% population immune, though.

You get closer closer herd immunity less restrictive rules, people infected/vaccinated, could fooled believing herd immunity - indeed could herd immunity legal restrictions, yet people taking sufficient precautions keep R 1, may fade time, yet virus dies away entirely. Brian you?? Yes. Words escaped me. Thanks. You’re social media ho kids anti-vax parents minority minority. Vaccinating children sane parents protect anti-vaxxers reducing total transmission.

I’d let kids (age 5 3) get vaccine tomorrow, without trial data, think it’s vital saving lives. don’t need school mandate it.

Listening Dr. Osterholm terrifying. wife got Pfizer vaccine dose 1. wife got temp 104 resting heart rate 130 well sample plater everything else.
She chrons tho.

I got sore spot arm like half day. You’re characterizing communism one particular way fit argument. exactly good faith. 

Also, re: capacity. venue holds 400 people livelihood venue depends maximizing capacity, it’s essentially mandate. Making rent isn’t optional. read Study shows tapeword infestation help treat Covid. Proof words tapeworm infestation halt language processing enough time eyes pass words drug Niclosamide. US prevents countries manufacturing vaccines.

The supplies used manufacture vaccines. like sitting US going unused. Exporting supplies make total vaccinations happen faster.

Curevac even approved.

This article reeks Eurocoping. Constitution say people cannot required current vaccinations contagious diseases mingling public? Ironically family got Pfizer mom got fucking rekt day (once much better getting vaccinated) girlfriend got Moderna feel anything sore arm doses. anecdote get side effects either still worth it.  viruses mutationally constrained: balance mutation survival. one knows far SARS-CoV-2 mutate; speculate reached limit based data have. far vaccines able control disease caused variants: opinion vaccination precludes worrying variants. fact variants may evade antibody immunity evade cell immunity: cell epitopes variants largely unchanged. cells clear infected cells prevent serious disease. Hence view cells save us. possible might reformulate vaccines future years due continued antigenic drift, influenza vaccines, year current vaccines suffice. need get majority population! mandated university meant. Plus, don’t require vaccine records employees, also campus. seems little unfair me. matter justify EU performance, reality wound end procurement line. lashing various directions predicament they're in.

I ask again...what UK right EU unable unwilling resulted UK top pile EU it? anyone's fault EU's? think accuracy report UK hit Herd Immunity Monday? Yea, sorry mean dick. reason faq guidance first offered. That's best one. US approved vaccines tremendous job everything listed. want deal second shot choice, J J. that’s truth, need tell truth. Health officials need say “we know vaccines heavily cut transmission, vaccination reason social distance wear masks. know lie getting vaccinated, wear masks social distancing.”

Just truthful, rather wrapping pseudo science waffling. lot issues trials Oxford. Trials started AZ even onboard needed adjusting. AZ made errors too, main easily issues predated them. reddit history says otherwise. Again, may Allah help you. One day hope Islamophobia gone. It’s true children didn’t get transmit virus B117 variant. dont need dig anything, virgins recognizable lingo. smell piss shit basement. risk mitigation needs placed context. likely risk? costs mitigation?

And costs mitigation outweigh risk, you’d foolish opt mitigation instead merely accepting risk. 

Yes, risk COVID scary, risk allowing children ride motor vehicles, swim, participate team sports. Exactly this!

We anything different first shot, still behaving immunity. get second shot days. We're going continue change nothing still 2 weeks that, start resume activities *(shopping, various Dr. appointments we've delaying year, etc..)* we'll continuing distance mask vaccine saturation community, see collective community spread clearly safe levels. scientists Oxford really good job developing safe efficient vaccine record time. 

The problem project upscaling production going slowly - AZ delivered much less doses initially estimated, example Pfizer/BioNTech spot deliveries. 

I don’t know AstraZeneca incompetent, vaccine hard produce, production increase considerably vaccine main vaccine rolled mid low income countries. uk obviously. chief difference existing vaccines time. different story today. I'm sure frustrating hell Curevac really care. Pump existing ones asap rather allocate resources speculative option. there's excess resources, give Curevac. Ot coure, cant hold someone force jab arm. either convince want limit certain spheres society battle probably better avoided. sense enough people get vaccinated enough vaccine resisters get infected achieve fairly high level herd immunity. Kids eventually get vaccinated even though really problem kids unless special ccomorbidities make vulnerable. heard British scientist podcast day ask insightful question: virus sprung next lab America European Union country, would scientific community accept country type behavior China exhibited. course wouldn’t. We’d likely know origin virus now. China plays rules rest world holds accountable.  Government little choice. Initial US partner halted fears US vaccine nationalism. two U.K. options GSK best bet weren’t interested (Oxford/governments demand done non-profit basis didn’t make desirable). 

AZ UK pharmaceutical company sufficient size take operation. 150 kids die per year riding bikes I'm still going buy kid bike weird statement. Herd immunity kicks much sooner that, depending circumstances. think probably already 20-30% starts becoming factor. time like everyone vaccinated safe 70% population immune, whatever level define. still beneficial reach even higher level immunity. hate Palestinians anyone else, allah keep help himself. clear ancestor SARS-CoV-2 likely related virus bat. supported sequence analysis highly related bat isolates China Thailand. closest virus SARS-CoV-2 genome level RaTG13 isolated 2013 96% identical. virus ancestor CoV-2: distant.

I’m welfare universalist, comes cash payments, although big part it. problem people don’t want raise taxes even 90% would better it. don’t *want* pay even though would benefit excited go Mexico City October. damn certain we'd able repurpose existing medication would turn Covid cold. I've wondering since last spring. Ralph Baric guest TWiV \#591.  48 minutes in, says I'm saying scientific community defined contemporary human coronaviruses mild common cold diseases, reality emerged animal reservoirs 100 800 years ago idea severe naive adult populations.  likely, weren't. probably brutal diseases, like SARS, MERS, SARS-2 adult individuals get older. 

I'm interested learning historical coronaviruses, like affected humans civilizations.  try research older diseases, get lots information bubonic plague, yellow fever outbreaks, 1918 flu.  try search information coronaviruses, I'm simply overwhelmed information SARS-CoV-2, original SARS, MERS. 

Is place start reading truly historical coronavirus outbreaks, ones occurred 1918 flu pandemic?  Dr. Baric mentioned ""800 years ago"", particular outbreak might thinking of?  particular term, phrase time period looking into? books articles subject readable laypeople?  Basically, anything could point direction could get foothold research would greatly appreciated.  [Or can't think something offhand, still listen TWiV maybe others might able think approaches could use?] 

Thank again, years various microbe.tv shows, past year TWiV, AMA.  Seriously: thank you. +3.40M according Cyrus Shahpar versus +3.36M last Thursday.

7 day average stands 3.03M, versus 3.02M yesterday. makes feel physically sick. children risk covid? No. Leave alone. point vaccinated then? clicked CDC website. get test returning USA even proof vaccination? travel, even vaccination? CDC recommends get tested 3-5 days return, even vaccine. Seriously... even get vaccinated? Got second dose Pfizer yesterday. Arm feels like got hit baseball bat, odd feeling stiffness throughout whole body. 

Well worth though. probably new viral strain going around. probably took evolve. Also relaxation people's activities gradual. People still least little cautious December-January, announcement vaccines like disease even exist. people extra careless last 3 months. science. messaging. There's huge contingent trying anticipate idea lie vaccination status order mask/distance. 

I find counterproductive worry about, personally believe enough vaccinated achieve herd immunity. need stop trying walk messaging tightrope accounts exception rather rule. Well like things related COVID statistics, I'm guessing there's lag. People test positive today might infected days week ago, fewer people vaccinated, vaccines also take time deliver immune protection. country lot people vaccinated now, mean can't another wave, wave may building many vaccines administered people time build immune response vaccine. LOL, release vaccine countries first place want vaccine criticized. Also, FAQ frequent question? not. many vaccinated Ontario? Judging Israel probably 50% 60%. think even remotely close that. would hilarious wasn’t something going inject onto people arms without tested. Yeah, say. get it. But, concerns important? bad person ignoramus wanting research get best vaccine? vaccine technologies think hold promise future vaccine development. mRNA vaccines seem obvious choice thoughts example self-assembling protein nanoparticle vaccine candidates? mixed system. 1st priority 80+, nursing homes health care workers. 2nd priority 70+, people certain illnesses select professions (teachers et al.), 3rd 60+, illnesses professions. 4th rest. variant worse younger people young people older people vaccinated hospitalized reduced rate? Times Israel state-run propaganda... again, post history full misinformation, assume truth never get past hatred Palestinians. May Allah help you. 150 kids die per year riding bikes everyone still buys kids bikes. There's certain risks acceptable levels, kids likely get abducted die covid thats reality What's point? Caution understandable warranted anyone unvaccinated, small children without underlying health issues proven extremely low risk COVID. Especially fully vaccinated parents, #1 exposure risk anything.

They get sick colds flus kids get normally time COVID. second Pfizer yesterday. fever chills last night, migraine today, aches. arm sore, got shot, it’s sore 2 inches down. accounts happen June trends hold. 

But right. Restrictions scientific, give power government institutions curtail freedoms don’t get had. Reverse causality. demand ICU increases, death increases. ICU's get overwhelmed, deaths increase. truth though. Normality wait vaccine numbers. waits community infection numbers. Vaccines change numbers, control them. Please provide scientific source states kids risk Covid. sounds like get information former president. soon go getting vaccine? furthermore, stop precautions result let guard down?

My wife first shot changed nothing. get second shot days. We're going continue change nothing 2 weeks that, start resume activities (shopping, various Dr. appointments we've delaying year, etc..) we'll continuing distance mask vaccine saturation community, see collective community spread clearly safe levels.  I'm willing take chances, I'd imagine US also take chances. We'll back normal 4th July latest. proven study yet VoC evaded vaccines yet. Link I'm wrong though! would rather take high chance sick day two vaccine rather 1% chance weeks ICU Covid. Thanks willingness contribute though. Hopefully start soon. trials young children right now, would happy sign mine nobody asked :( Yes magically got sent UK ZERO shots made way Europe.

Ok ... ""seems"" case you, medical science showing, same. There's great deal research suggesting post-Covid symptoms very, common, including kids. severe long-lasting damage is, we've yet find out.

It sounds like problem way thinking workplace friendships. Workplace friendships make work fun provide outlet support things get rough. sounds like thinking workplace friendships strictly transactional rather existing sake enjoyment socialization. 

I think matter personal preferences - would prefer friends work. I, hand, WOULD like workplace friendships. Even moment time particular job, still worth me. think regulars keep coming regardless many exaggerating things (from worrying much end, pretending like ton people want things return pre-pandemic complain them) justify keep putting time effort commenting here. amount people time spent keep going really many months now. sub used far busy been. bright spots here, especially Merkel co took threat seriously early on. 

With bit luck, example Italy (with respect timing), worked early ""well"" here. Good shutdown contact tracing, supply masks really shot roof. People wore masks required summer good. 

Then Germany , rest Europe, went sleep second lock came late. 

Also vaccine negotiations ... eventually turned EC...and EC want buy mRNA vaccines . led basically little late vaccines orders.  

Since Merkel lost political credibility Germany kept insisting throwing orders biontech Germany secured way. faith AZ EC exacerbated weak strategy people calling Merkels head here.

RemindMe! 5 months. J J 100 percent effective serious illness death that’s matters. cares get little flu trials still double blond thus 50% chance getting active vaccine shot? fuck going about?  thinks need keep restrictions place everyone including kids vaccinated?

I've seen people sub claim allowed get back normal kids vaccinated. realistic I'd argue they're likely posturing, people say sorts things

While certainly feel bad kids growing Covid, can't personally justify putting life hold they're vaccinated. actually decision crazy former PM Slovakia get Sputnik, shitshow far. guess former PM now.

 vaccines probably go waste anyway. Covid vaccine mandatory children. Covid 0.003 percent chance dying covid according CDC I'm talking both. Seems extremely rare me, say take chances children world. Acetaminophen/Paracetamol Ibuprofen recommended vaccinating physician got second Pfizer yesterday. Definitely feel like need haha, fighting nice fever headache day. Graaf je haar ook op? *Positive Tests cases Yeah, it’s bat shit think we’re going allow tens thousands people die wait paperwork filed asserting already known safety vaccines injected hundreds millions people without incident.

I’m aware real world, we’re going skip paperwork. They’re going let vaccinate kids FDA stamps paperwork. they’re eligible, I’m going hesitate, think anyone murderer. Again, know. talking deaths, long-term complications. studies shown damage infection extremely common, rare, know long complications last. He's basically living Texas, permitting almost nightly, id bet happening. Enjoy! J&amp;j too? Everyone shocked there's conception less side effects. that's true, petrified think moderna would done me. 

All say, thank God I'm done. first, go back second, horrifyingly bad. CDC updated yet Eerst even langs je moeder I’m day tell us return max impact. much want right thing much wanna grub money point. lot cheaper still charge full tuition paying keep facilities open ""due covid"". thing is, “Young adults making larger percentage hospitalizations” “average age lower before” many older people vaccinated expected. Statistically, that’s what’s going happen.

The problem many people read headline hear news interpret “young people *more likely* end hospitalized before”, like young people trending towards danger level old people, danger level young people greatly increasing - that’s case all. Even there’s percentage increase variant X OG Covid, it’s still tiny, *tiny* number. There’s nothing gained thinking (well, gaining clicks, suppose idea). Wanneer ga je weg dan? You’re right, meant 600k typed 300k instead far protected full effect kicks in, body man. could full effect first within 2 days even, could take full 2 weeks. matter quickly body catches notice vaccine, recognizes is, builds ""contingency plan"" get real deal. 
Like cancer, people's body sees says ""whoa whoa whoa... kill shit!"" people's body ignores taken full control. Nice! Good luck! “soon ex wife” this? unrelated tiny little bit... plenty wrong. habit overestimating times. Yeah would awesome beat virus reached herd immunity, unfortunately many refused even consider may wrong. There’s bat shit crazy sides aisle, luckily, people rational! extremely rare? children likely die car crash develop long term COVID complications?  spoiled children ones scared need everyone else give everything safety. You’re entitled feel safe times. Everyone else sacrificed last year, taking untold amounts damage, you’re worried age 25 0.002% risk death catch it. could, know, choose stay home. spoiled ones ones year later want normalcy. personally started taking multivitamin since last year. thinking since poor confidence completeness diet COVID gave last little nudge remember buy it. Yes, exponential growth, way people waiting hospitalized. states cities lot people waiting line ICU open. Lack supply, vaccination centers prioritized. Supply increased massively, getting vaccines, too. know yet. wish people cared like you. many selfish people can’t even wear simple piece cloth. Even that's case heard story someone got vaccines turning 18 anti-vax parents could longer stop them. Yep, it'd good simmering tensions ease bit. sense satisfaction coming certain quarters EU Brits dying horrific rate certainly justify reciprocal attitude us relatively sluggish rollout third wave, there's enough bad blood is. Everyone's human, we're together quicker every country gets people vaccinated sooner get back normal. Sure, epidemiologist, I'd interested critique Osterholm's analysis. you? studies vaccines already proven adults could sign kids for, currently 12-17? global expectation China help vaccinate Africa falls West?

China allowed damn thing spread initially cover-ups Chinese New Year, clearly bought invest heavily Africa. expectation deliver jack shit, bunch finger wagging western countries rightfully taking care first. world falling behind academically something difficult recover possible lifelong neurological pulmonary issues resulting COVID? Kids incredibly plastic, recover bad semester two three, cannot grow new lungs.

What likelihood happening? world where, instead continuously reiterating super cautious guidelines due incentive structure flagged, took back seat let policy makers follow limited real time science quickly.

This exactly 50% tongue-in-cheek 50% serious, perform experiment already? Trump Administration approach? Hydroxychloroquine ""miracle cure""
 based one two studies later less debunked whatnot?

That approach works long policy makers follow path ends jiving reality situation everything goes smoothly. minute follow scientific dead-end - like hydroxychloroquine - turns illusion, lost trust tens millions people. Always wash produce. one ever suspects lettuce, definitely responsible fair share foodborne illness. Awesome use taxpayer money.

NOT! take Tylenol fight symptoms? contraindicated  would like personally thank test subject make informed decision want get vaccine. add consistently arrogant dismissive attitude many like field highly educated scientists analysts fields believe hypothesis onky possible highly likely true disgrace outrageous! hope wrong, would better conventional origin, ironically absurdity dismissive responses increases outsiders suspicions scientific community. Try actually explaining dismissed .. analysis evidence... zero zilch.. name calling seems have. seen DOCTORS. know, shockingly, doctors professionals disagree sometimes (OMG) doctors wrong. Side effects? mRNA *protects better*. fact. Obviously would want good stuff instead AZ. possible solution decentralizing national message allowing different states respond differently needed would’ve better funding state especially local health departments. Maybe would’ve useful City X tried masking earlier, City X’s epidemiologists seen decreased transmission, example. could’ve allowed smaller-scale “experiments” limiting risk clownshow like Trump’s HCQ. look forward every day. Thanks breakdown! sister tested positive, live w her. symptoms since saturday. currently feel amazing. wearing mask sanitizing everything staying 6 ft her, whats likelihood ill get covid? made laugh risk death extremely small, sickness may expected. 

My son grad student four weeks ago got Covid house mate didn’t care share experiencing symptoms. pretty sick initially. came home Easter still feeling weak lethargic. healthy active person knows isn’t back normal yet. think losing loved one covid woulsnt result covid related mental health issue? Anxiety comes pandemic? Isolation? Long term health issues? Anxiety going back person school? things cause covid related mental health issues....were maybe assuming mental health issues covid related kids miss going person school? share somewhere, got first shot today! 6 hours ago got Moderna, feeling little tired overall fine. Totally stoked grandpa who’s 80 FINALLY got vaccinated last week. Transferrable families children already killed themselves? insiders mad execs promised could make targets. EU mad individual workers company, responsibility top staff.

The EU easier J&amp;J far overpromise even close much AZ did, they're far better communicating actual targets. AZ cuts deliveries left right, sometimes 3 times over, suddenly notice week's delivery missing. point realize AZ fucked badly know else say. desperate victim evil EU PR here.

Remember people like subreddit foaming mouth EMA first suggested blood clot link claiming FUD spreading confirmed UK cases UK confirmed cases limited distribution younger people suddenly accepted? Yeah. family everyone know among them!

So feel encouraged! Lol well saw pull vial box really worried that.

I’ve gotten Flu, TDaP, Yellow Fever vaccines past year reactions either. tried get deal backfired. 76.9%

nice

I loved put 6.9 bold btw lmao linked super old article. There’s way vaccine could receive full approval May. process involves inspection facilities used produce vaccine bunch stuff...probably takes like 4 months minimum, haven’t applied yet AFAIK. 

Not sure downvoted asking source. May realistic quoted Pfizer full BLA, would shat pants glee. sure would look great someone's election strategy. waiting news another delivery delayed cancelled because...reasons. never doubted potential ability country vaccinate lot people quickly. issue bureaucracy inept way supply handled. It'd hilarious damn infuriating. specific tot current pandemic, general problem Germany. amount signatures, paperwork hurdles need jumped get literally anything done ridiculous times pandemic painful reminder that. Never mind cohesion management pandemic general pretty much gone, although hopefully changes degree next week, assuming threat federal legislation gets states line. cannot take another week depressing hellhole working retail currently is. looking graph sure right. Pfizer Biontech completely useless poor countries since needs stored extreme temperatures can't do. worked well richer countries opposite article saying. Yeah I'm one people refrigerated... rest family. I'm kind person buys things advance (ie, oh I'll run cereal next week, let's buy now) never run out, like lose anything little bit cautious, even ultimately useless. still old stock that's still available consumption. think I've ever actually run something buying replacement. ""patients"" mean hospitalized? I've found many articles that's referring search know sure Moderna Pfizer already enrolling younger groups. looked kids closest sites 5-6 hours away practical sure follow apps well. Exactly! 100% agree. it’s lesson learned hard, expense Canadian lives. It’s completely tasteless use political dunking moment. wait 7 days? is? pandemic

this makes sound uneducated lmfao, pandemic definition worldwide. sound like angsty teenagers twitter talking selfish people going parks ""omg there's worldwide pandemic going on."" Harper years him? Thanks helpful. First maybe feel like math - maybe I'm tired million things mind. ask question reddit. want help bother posting? make someone said understand something feel even dumber? time right wrong.... care colour political party it. fix it. either work not, right?

No?

Efficacy numbers matter.

Go ask Chile despite rolled SinoVac vaccine good percentage population still struggling surge. lol same! Holy shit reasonable comment?! *can't* r/coronavirus day here.  worry happening side effects.

Hope got vaccine fuck something up. also (ironically enough) really insensitive people people end spectrum vaccinated still experiencing mental health decline onset PTSD constantly lingering restrictions like masks social distancing reminders drawing end slow painful possible Pfizer apparently works SA better tests implied, Brazil. There’s many legitimate things criticize Feds general regards Covid. don’t understand chose hill die on. domestic production capacity failure parties power since shuttered. vaccine costly make really surplus it. way would work intended, one dose would give. Alas two doses required. worst case scenario could still catch bad (however unlikely fatal) case covid. Vaccines really really good preventing severe illness, hospitalization, death regardless variants. media done fantastic job making people antsy variants really poor job communicating absolute worst case, vaccine reduces relatively mild cold. Would hate immune compromised person deal people infecting them. Last week’s surge deliveries anomaly kinda obvious. Clickbait. CDC estimates 25% Americans Covid think guess far off.

They estimated Jan 1, we're probably closer 35% now.  That's plural form. sure, actually! Another awesome tidbit: 1/3 total population least 1 shot! assuming talking covid related mental health issues. ""to help cope covid"" made think johnson johnson Germany well paper lucky last March closed early. exclude better others Europe. point vaccinations reduce death hospitalization. 

Your parents care brother. agree decision, encourage open, honest, mature discussion them. Iowa like that

When look break deaths like 0-2 people actually dying per day time they're recorded offical trackers looks ""20 new deaths reported today"" I've also wondered clean spinach. Run water strainer spin dry. really going anything? even another way clean produce? guy refused let cruise ships dock.

And set checkpoints state border.

And blamed media reporting CoVID19.

And forbids local governments enforcing mask mandates. vaccines working - specifically, UK's plan maximize number people getting first shots giving shots 3/4 week schedule paying dividends. 

I'm hoping increase access vaccines among 16+ age groups US help drive numbers - convince vaccine hesitant right thing (which probably easier said done). “Israel may first country people immune protect aren’t.” — isn’t true, immune people always protect non-immune people regardless percentage population immune. 

Israel first country infected person will, average, infect less one person due populations immunity levels. Spinach ftw need doctor jab. paperwork monitoring done monkeys.

Source; work impfzentrum, monkey. risk contracting virus touching contaminated surface less 1 10,000.”

Considering hysteria AZ right people actively refusing vaccine like 1 million chance side-effect... doubt giving people stats help much. majority dumb understand risk statistics. 15 million doses discarded error manufacturing plant  sold great job getting massive amounts vaccines arriving large quantities.

The numb nuts premier ontario continues screw constantly though. Probably forehead readers inherently faulty. Ah you’re right. knew US test around 70 mixed numbers up. Europe, India, Russia China exporting 50% Covid vaccines.

Bloomberg says 726M shots given. China done 150M, India done 94M. Europe means EU assume? 70M there, numbers could added head. Another 12M Russia.

That puts us 326M doses used countries.

Are counting vaccines produced Belgium Germany exported EU countries ""exported?"" really seem like that's way done given EU went together (for part) vaccine acquisition.

Doesn't seem like numbers claim since US produced like 150M vaccines so.

How many vaccines Russia even made? tell, lot, little concern US problem making diplomatic capital months come we're shipping tens millions month. grow fast, really do. Never ever have. think crazy people went level . people stored specific room 3 days let virus die ...

I've vaccinated since end December (health care worker), (vaccinated) wife returning cautious normal. still can't much kids, though. Despite that, 12 year old daughter sick COVID right now, 13 year old son probably without symptoms, almost certainly school since almost one there, nature, vaccinated. guess we're clear (assuming daughter fully recovers, certain yet, though looks good). thrown wrench plans even though whole extended family vaccinated, cancel easter since risk active infection going on.

I'm entirely sure going long post, feels good rant little. Oh yeah, news loves play long covid symptoms, straight point absurdity. frequently see news stories posted Reddit third asymptomatic people covid long lasting serious complications. start thinking friends who've covid (and know shit ton people who've point) fine. start digging little bit lumping ""anxiety"" long haul symptoms.....well shit pandemic anxious. Why? Yea. live building families kids. course I’m going continue wear mask protect walking building . don’t know asthma issues. trivial thing. live among psychopaths. *laughs swedish* sure find link since Google news saturated recent articles search “school reopenings” remember saying last May saw “no reason” schools couldn’t open normally September last year. think anticipating better contact tracing policies back then. Amazing forget EFTA nation(s) order vaccines thought EU would share. others mentioned, put stick daily post top? search looking post. considered Moderna trial young teen, told 2/3rds would receive vaccine 1/3rd would get placebo. Ended it, since would 5+ hour drive get trial site.  Lunatics...
We need enforce vaccination passports make outcasts, join rest vaccinated fight pandemic work purely automatic. stand front scanner records temperature says good go ... Well, guess (I've never witnessed anyone over-read). Unfortunately young aged need protection. younger generation social mobility makes prime infection vectors, aged immunity vulnerability. part reason compliance health orders toilet. 

No, stupid orange moron stupid orange cult are. Well, unbelievably huge number people scientifically illiterate willing let propaganda politicians run fucked lives. viruses mutate still got polio small pox control. Wow super encouraging, thanks info! spoiled ones ones year later want normalcy.

If opinionated assholes refuse abide rules people want to, know, suffer worldwide pandemic, maybe world would little less shitty. Congrats deciding that.

You (unsurprisingly) completely off-base epidemic entails. strong side effects J&amp;J. Heard hits young people hard big deal. It’s immune response like reaction harmful chemicals anything. side effects gave peace mind working anything Yea. transmission = opportunities mutations.

This end something kills 1 4 kids.

Same people stop taking antibiotics finishing feel better 1 2 days. People still insist antibiotic resistant strains myth despite medical research growing alarming rate. What? Canada Mexico absolutely US friends. ""loan"" drugs way get around Trump's contract signed get drugs. really interesting post yesterday. virus mutates point vaccinations? playing whack-a-mole try beat variants forever? parents going keep inside 5 year old brother gets vaccinated I'm depressed still least another year BS.

Possibly. also extremely age dependent Brazilian population younger many countries.

In recent news easy forget still lower per capita mortality rich western countries, notably US. local chain. I’m sure others area. much glycogen store low carb diet. burn glycogen, fat stores broken ketones fuel. personally aim ketosis, get vast majority carbs fruits veggies instead grains. Balancing micro nutrients lot harder ketogenic diet, unless really organ meats. kind feel like waste reduction lists worked states January- March. likely combination fewer old people getting severe symptoms due largely vaccinated, younger people think Covid vaccines available taking risks - even able get vaccinated themselves.

All get vaccinated - way, everything reopens (whether we're ready not), I've done part. Along knowing fuck fuck all, obviously know anyone who's situation. know several. Plus low case count thus far even island nation closed borders possibility single case existing somewhere grow hand fast. Ironically, better keeping cases low higher R0 little way naturally acquired immunity slow spread. post really nothing absurd article, btw confirmation bias sort SCIENCE tries rule out. Yes also significantly smaller percentage vaccinated still downward trend cases, hospitalisations deaths Fl Tx reported? understand that. lots stockpiled food even eating from, neighbours starving, give away (or least *sell* it).

That case AstraZeneca. likely approved time matter US, rest world desperately needs *now*.  far pandemic response consider Around 120.000 received stopped. four died. see described explanation said rollout slow. Basically, outlined cause - one disagree with, change effect, remains slow rollout.

Ups, thought talking Israel! already another job? feel bad American friends permanent residence years Canada. They’re watching everyone get vaccinated can’t. wish they’d lift quarantine US citizens want travel US vaccine. Canada makes quarantine even you’re fully vaccinated. 

They can’t afford hotel house family 14 days coming home taking time travel. jobs requiring appear person, maybe change soon variants? 

My American friends countries flown US world vaccine. can’t believe managed decently US. think it’s open anyone 16+. Yes. 

[Graph vaccination rate 

* Green = recovered
* Dark blue = fully vaccinated
* medium blue = two weeks past first shot yet week past second shot
* pale blue = less two weeks past first shot
* grey = kids 16
white = eligible unvaxxed

basically everyone wants one got one. half vaccinated come minority communities (Arabs ultra-Orthodox Jews), despite groups around quarter eligible population course think WFH good thing workout employer paying haha california die real fire Slow word would use. Politically hindered cronyism financial gain would accurate, roll tongue well. Think MHRA said difference age groups came clotting?

the reason said U30s get alternative because, UK risk catching Covid much lower was. spike balance tips favour taking vaccine. Sputnik V ? break process every single vaccine manufacturer able go through, Russia obviously intent dragging entire process achieve desired goals - sow discord EU.

There's explanation waited months even send documentation start review process. 

I'm also skeptical quantities would arrive, struggle deliveries even AZ does, even Hungary said Russian production insufficient vaccination EU approved vaccines Sinopharm. company hasn’t mentioned anything yet idea small office (I share desk someone) 8am dress clothes makes upset. don’t know I’m going expected talk people 9+ hours day. Agreed. EU made lots mistakes undoubtedly vdL bad job well. Nonetheless. every state greedy US UK terms vaccine exports vaccine contracts, .... would answer? understand praised much. 
I think great, program run well lots vaccines end people's arms. Good organisation, doubt. also millions Astra vaccines standing around US neighbors Canada need. Seems wrong me. Rubbish. UK ones ""politicized"" vaccine.

The data also comes straight scientific medical community. absolutley count numbers right. AstraZeneca blood clots: anyone knows known cases associated first second dose? think ...I checking make sure miss anything get liberal arts degree? I’m sorry joke you. Thanks - that's really helpful! saying 56% received one shot include 129k recovered people, recovered people represent 1% population, overlap significant? Yes. understand variant contains one often hundereds mutations. statement pedantic..

The double mutant amedia term denote strain contains 2 spike protein mutations much prover increase infectivity viral load (severity thus death) also reduce vaccine effectiveness. 

None variants monitored federal officials combination two mutations, known L452R E484Q, latter closely related well-known mutation known E484K.

Both spike protein mutations certainly proven increase either viral loading (severity ) ability spread. 

Your statement factually incorrect. comment age like milk באמת פוג anyone still trust Russia shit they've pulled? anyone noticed well South Africa Covid wise? We've eyes UK, Israel, U.S. much seems like due great vaccine rollouts far South Africa's 7 day average cases 780 (equivalent U.S. daily average 4368) deaths 7 day average 38 (equivalent U.S. daily average 213). Brazil wants say hello This, exactly. much blocking works, EU asked AZ apply export licence Australian shipment. avoids officially reject licence (a political face save) practical effect (importantly) effect caused state (the definition blocking), everything else one talking that? 

Because EU commission decided encourage vaccine production world within borders championing embrace free markets anti vaccine-nationalism. commission won, got lots facilities built many countries choose import vaccines EU countries rather build manufacturing sites. reneged deal. Leaving countries without vaccines past point local manufacturing possible.

The commission two reasonable options, 1. look enforced priority start would mean lots countries would build increased production facilities either look deliver vaccine contracts rest world *or* 2. take free market approach benefit greatly increased capacities revenues generated within bloc. 

Instead chose unreasonable option IMO sad reality problem find entirely foreseeable. deliberate would rounding people shooting them. Simply failing act genocide cruelty. Well afraid wrong there. AZ vaccine excellent vaccine. trials suggested AZ vaccine slightly less effective Pfizer, real world results UK suggested may slightly better Pfizer reducing hospitalisations deaths. Health Ministry (and Eran sometimes) publish ""raw"" R number little meaningless point. [Here interesting Hebrew University epidemiologist Ronit Calderon-Margalit talking Israel’s vaccine rollout. Pretty interesting.   It’s 40 minutes.

Australia reached herd immunity. reason can't open relax despite cases close zero vaccine rollout extremely slow. Good lord someone think even remotely positive? *Military Industrial Complex entered chat* We're definitely relaxed terms day day behaviour.

Thanks answering Palestinians? one slowest vaccine rollouts developed country... answer question - “why opposed vaccine passports” - give read. makes many salient points. Israel literally refuse vaccinate anyone already Covid?

Yes. Israel vaccinate recovered people weeks ago considered immune. Recovered people get one dose only. 

But country tracks ""vaccinated recovered"" separately distinguish number. 129k recovered people vaccinated double-counted. Aw kids shouldn’t care they’re lost causes much done ""Pfizer has halted shipments coronavirus vaccines Israel outrage country **failing transfer payment last 2.5 million doses supplied** country, Jerusalem Post source claim contrary? average, average lockdown across UK harsher, stricter lasted several months longer average restrictions lockdowns across Germany.

Anyway, I’ve saying months Sputnik red herring, can’t provide doses Q3 honestly point? EU still review vaccine since certain member states using wont “save” EU vaccine rollout like people think Could work-life balance issues. There’s huge focus Denmark, making sure life suffering work. Without it, it’s unusual people skip days, private appointments. Yes, that’s covidiots can’t wrap heads around. half population vaccinated? That's amazing! China China wants. not? Honest question Honestly, take step back reflect saying saying. motivation here? obvious read even study's abstract. blame you, honestly. dismissively respond kneejerk reaction something quite reasonable.

[Here quote relevant conducted retrospective quasi-experimental study included daily COVID-19 case reports 11 March 2020 1 March 2021 219 U.S. counties (or parishes); attendance numbers total 269 total NFL games, 117 fans assigned treatment group, remaining unattended 152 games, assigned controls. Separate daily time-series COVID-19 cases case rates (derived 2019 Census county-level residential population estimates) generated using three separate smoothing parameters (7-, 14-, 21-day simple moving averages (SMAs)) every NFL team plotted actuals (daily cases/rates) detect potential spikes (outliers) incidence levels following games.

So, right bat, find notion ""spikes"" means background factors like ""how open state is"" factored first place. spike characterized outlier relative baseline conditions, can't blame ""spike"" state conditions presumably changed. Furthermore, compare prevalence spikes stadiums either fans fans find spikes -- 4th July happened coincide NFL games something, people meeting homes watch.

Now, yes, maybe TX half stadiums attendance, day NFL games Houston/Dallas happened holidays caused spikes. seems pretty implausible, yeah? always open lurking factors, seems pretty convincing NFL games tied COVID cases. be? people going bars nearby NFL game before/after game, would expect prime way spread COVID? haven’t quite reached immunity Netanyahu yet unfortunately....  yet they're worse pretty much every state did. It’s probably new variant (local-new global-new) hasn’t confirmed yet... say would - much smaller % actually would. know bar Pretty much every doctor wife’s group said fuck I’m region repeatedly spurned precautions.

Cant really strike doctor, quit, complete clauses force move far away.

We dipped cases got low enough, hospital region screwed get even slightest peak.

We gave year, it’s tank, hospital pays way better, resources, local government gives shit.

Be careful rural America, healthcare system already precarious, now... hope specific group speak civic duty get vaccinated. 

I distancing masking beyond point vaccines widely available American wants them, afford pay fines/deal legal consequences ignoring mandates. best luck ""specific group"". Regular life coming back. I'll returning normal summer, come join me. Nah, you’re crazy. Everyone different depends job too.

Maybe engage conversation?  Workers together strong! gloves worn discarded shot done. nurse probably pulled immediately prior patient, sanitized, donned new ones grabbing syringe bandaid.

Fun Fact: Gloves actually optional giving vaccines. IM injections pretty low risk!

“According CDC ACIP, wearing gloves required healthcare workers administering vaccinations adults children. official guidelines state: “OSHA regulations require gloves worn administering vaccinations unless persons administering vaccinations open lesions hands likely come contact patient’s body fluids.”  wife office every day. days working home. dreading going back office 100% time. nice less miles car fuel savings.

Sweats chills. tired try bath. It’s bizarre. one hate working home. careful. Thats exactly thing company said forced us go back office. us hired permanent wfm. Ended leave due change lived 2+ hours away. hear that. Legit thinking I've developed mild agoraphobia something create like nation wide union refuse full time office work? one concerned post's title ""post-pandemic world""? worldwide daily infection numbers currently increase again, equal October-November 2020 numbers. Even US daily cases, much lower early 2021, still equal July-August numbers around 65k daily cases. 
Do regular doctor talk to? schedule 2nd shot location paramedics place talk to? concerned allergic reaction scheduled vaccination (got Moderna) ""mega-site"" fully staffed medical personnel. problems all, fortunately, going back second shot Monday. Good luck! Well thats good. Still going forward going issue clean plants practices, trust crucial. well! happy secured remote job instead sitting cloud unknowns. previous company (government job) hasn’t said single thing updated WFH policy I’m pretty sure it’s won’t option. don’t worry rest easy knowing future me. know, possible??? Like seen measure vaccinations taking effect. Yes! tested weekly entire year You’d think. something tells 7-0 GOP majority Florida Supreme Court might open letting order stand seems politically expeditious you’ve read anything passport system? It’s everywhere essential places like grocery stores generally won’t require proof vaccination don’t see private store company, even deemed essential shouldn’t allowed relegate unvaccinated unconfirmed vaccinated curbside limited hours help control viral spread. It’s voluntarily unvaccinated people stripped rights access buy needed supplies. 

For something like air travel makes sense require vaccine passport. Small enclosed spaces packed ppl hours cases ideal situation pandemic. vaccine passport would improve situation travelers. companies also already require large amounts personal info &amp; paperwork fly, what’s one piece buy plane ticket? Oh, wish comment ""can't put genie back bottle"" true.

We really thought company would least consider flex type schedule. Nope. Back office full time. back wasting 2.5 - 3 hours day accomplish nothing. could never set foot office accomplish job 100%. others said thread, way distractions office. I'm less effective. 

The unfortunate reality many us hoping dramatic shift style, still WAY many old school type thinkers believe none us effective home office. shame, know people happy even partial work home schedule. get much life back. 

I know I'm definitely going miss it. Commute waste time fuel never caught it

Did antibody test done? Legit curious. Why?

All hear great Canadian health care is. getting vaccinated today! I’m excited! True. Results officially enough time passes.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  click link dude, hospitalizations following exact trend line, week behind. people obviously risk dying next couple weeks. OurWorldInData great compare things. following graphs since December 19th (start vaccinations) compare US Israel adjusted population size:

* [Cumulative doses [Daily (average) doses [Percentage total population least partly [Percentage total population fully [Daily (average) [Daily (average) [Daily (average) test [Effective reproduction [Patients [Patients short, US probably 70 days behind US terms administered doses. 70 days behind moment, speed Israel vaccinating 2 3 times high US currently vaccinating, take US longer get Israel currently.

Israel started dropping 7-day rolling average cases 25% (Jan. 17th) total population least partially vaccinated. Israel rose cases 31% (Jan. 25th) 40% (Feb. 7th). dropped quickly. 49% (Feb. 20th) stabilised/rose 57% (Mar. 8th), quickly dropped again, continued since then.

It probably mostly lockdowns getting lockdowns. first drop probably completely due lockdown. stabilisation afterwards probably due people minding anymore, vaccination rates still low (31%), vaccinations start make difference (40%) people starting care again, apparently cases still dropping. starts drop again. last stabilisation probably due almost opening everything up. Even though vaccination rates (49%) cannot compensate yet, even vaccines (57%) suppress that.

The US currently 32%. Lol would support opening Texas since conditions obviously different? 

Or logic support building tornado shelters areas prone land slides? Disagree myself. don’t get shit done place eat sleep fuck. Every day worked home probably 50% usual quality best. place focus work that’s you’re great, mindset home relaxing isn’t mixed feelings trappings work. 

Not hearing lot days, likely minority. Well, click article see hospitalizations looking? wouldnt deaths follow like usual couple weeks later? Farmers would feed grass animals corn cost more. hate working 5 feet bed. feel like I'm working home, feel like I'm living work. 110MM 42% adults. Halfway there. vaccine supply chain accelerating. Another month start running willing arms. see coming domestic travel though right? really denying that

Not necessarily. comment one way I've heard interview mastercard CTO

Source? ""Heard"" evidence. putting danger? people decided get vaccinated? keep hearing whole “people slacking home” argument I’d like know many people slacking WFH also slacking office. obviously depends company lets people get away with, I’ve coworkers throughout years always seemed work worked. Personally I'm dying go back office. Sure nice worry commute, dress work clothes.. I'm end rope working 5 feet sleep. prodigal son returns CNA US. I'm thrilled see kind progress, I'm process nagging family getting jabbed (US. parents, in-laws, husband 2 doses Pfizer Moderna. second dose Moderna next week. adult son got J&amp;J Monday, adult daughter set J&amp;J tomorrow. I'm putting money mouth is.)

But, huge fan vaccine advances, long Covid arrived, wonder Israel change vaccine requirements entry? know several localized measles outbreaks US recent years tied unvaccinated travelers returning Israel. understand religious communities vaccinate due doctrinal issues, tend respected Israel's government. 

But wonder country might change entry requirements improve public health outcomes? seems like pragmatic low-cost way reduce spread illness.

(That said? also problem US same. want travel? Fine. can't enter/reenter US without proof certain vaccines, legitimate medical exemption. seems like Israel likely do.) Ah, good. come lot businesses operate given state. revenue come people state. neighboring state ID? Cool, show it, not, let 'em treat non-vaxed. That's biz though.

This one ""don't let perfect enemy good"" things here. Maybe experience working different big companies seen people top got skill job efficiency social, networking person got long everyone. people afterthoughts despite hard worked....let go. jelly. I’m gonna call jelly school That’s literally untrue. Try again. meme repeated much, absolutely merit. people go fear mongering realize none serious action taken precautionary measure. Better wait mRNA ones. Japan good PR internationally boom 80s, Sony. country still lots issues (but country perfect, American, criticize country too.) leaving Summer. may unpopular opinion manager entry level call center employees, can't wait get back office... I'm also pretty social person get distracted easily benefit well. advisory year, updated include warnings variants. Correct it? There’s nothing wrong described. meant record healthcare providers. unique patient ID pharmacy pop clinic gave shot, leaving patient number blank blank appropriate. That's Canadian comment make. One friends works doctors office environment. office announced going reopen. coworker MD came one day, double masked holding box sanitizing products, sanitized entire office anticipation coming back work.  person entered office previous 10 months, fully vaccinated.

I swear media turned susceptible people crazed lunatics constant hysteria. Yes read that. However, end day, every country decide going vaccine. I'm afraid country one countries completely stop giving AZ 30, despite getting first dose before. hope come rational decision. People act like commute dead time that's completely unproductive.

If drive, radio there's lot things there. Music, course, proven mood lifter, that's thing. Get caught news favorite podcast. Enjoy audiobook. Sure, could sit kitchen bedroom things half hour log remote job, let's realistic here, nobody kind organization schedule way fall victim lifestyle creep financial raise, case get increase free time. far likely extra time spent sleeping dicking around social media. ignoring fact many, driving therapeutic.

If take public transit commute, options wide open. Play games phone Switch. Put order groceries delivered later. Or, people driving, catch podcasts.

Yes, lose five hours $30 worth gas commute week working home. 5 hours really lost plenty things would absolutely bother making time otherwise (and since pandemic started, truthfully) money lost paying gas small price pay social mental health benefits actually company humans majority waking hours. ""zero tolerance policy"" ""work home""

Lol. think working home form sin wrongdoing, like alcoholism tardiness. NY much lower case positivity thank Florida Florida little testing it’s hard trust numbers. hard really. happily wear mask go museums, bowling alley. reason can't wear mask watching high school basketball game.  Keep mind everything opening full capacity yet. Social distancing still observed, less strict.  Sensible adults going problem wearing mask public transit, grocery store, mall, etc. know mask allowing us get roam again. Goddamn dude. way self important. Get yourself. Hell, I’d rather quit work people every day, too. wish option. Good. want  Can’t wait 6/14 Extremely ethnocentric ethnostate thinks unique special, different superior... find they're unique special, realize they're different superior all. fun Covid Japan.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah man I’m baffled still believing Japan ideal amazing country covid contained successfully. “Japan model” ass, fucking Abe. least dozen countries making vaccines. True disagreeable 5 years certain presidency, current one  Mine said anything either yet. currently renovating entire building even office right knows they're going say data obtained? randomized obtained wide variety sources? need 2,000? survey used? 👍🏻 would bet people feel parents children home. Parenting working full-time remotely difficult simultaneously.  still get college university demanded able get staff priority vaccinations even teaching home fall after. got priority highrisk people. Yes 👍🏻 sides, laughing hard. this. job cant remote (nurse) live busy city. leave two hours work starts drive 30 minutes stand chance late. late patients, days easily 14 15 hours. yup know, I""m pretty sure military ship considered US soil matter docked. happened vaccinate every person came 'tour' ship, well... I’m tired kind stuff. everything damn divisive! Wait, miss something...it's compliment? stellar work regarding variants? 


Colour surprised, assumed reward discovering variant 100 travel bans. likely die driving actual corona though young age though...  haven’t seen anyone else talk euphoric feeling, definitely one 1st moderna dose. know wasn’t relief/excitement shot I’m generally depressed shit week. 

I shot 11am Friday didn’t feel different day. awakened 5am Saturday chills aches. gone 6:30am 8:00 felt like Superman. got kinds chores I’d putting off. cheerful little worried kind reaction reduced oxygen brain. 

I didn’t get high second dose, though. knocked fever, fatigue headache 12 hours. expendable worker, entire comment section reads first world problems. Exactly. People dumb enough go sporting events pandemic likely dumb things too. annoying shit. could see couple unique light fixtures, like two fixtures, kind crap. People time hobbies, gym routines, social clubs. Besides, making good friends work tricky you’re always balancing true, authentic self work image. got new job last year. boss maybe 10 times since hired. I've literally every day since started. frustrating folks know nothing situation ground dismiss everyday experiences Japan. totally agree you, I'm beyond frustrated response government well employer Japan (which ...what pandemic? Basically.) New Zealand’s lockdown many things insanely strict. allowed people living different households buddy up, lockdowns nowhere else allowed. wasn’t long enough disrupt domestic transmission. takes roughly 10-15 days transmission even develop symptoms 28-day lockdown isn’t enough unless individuals isolated rather households three-day lockdowns cases. joke. 

They less connected outside world. Everyone praises see Ardern anti-Trump: young woman progressive rhetoric still rejecting countries risk handled well find *white* face credit saying Japan fine: yeah, don’t know anything huh?

Did know Japan investing much taxes Olympics measures covid? know planning spend 7.3 billion yen develop app Olympics, probably could use something else? know considering prioritise athletes vaccinations haven’t even finished vaccinating medical workers/elderly people? know 23 people Ministry Health Labour Welfare fucking dinner midnight telling us stay home dinner 5 people, least 3 confirmed infected today? say like “oh yeah regret happened make sure won’t happen again” reality it’s gonna happen again. know many Japanese people stopped giving shit covid pretending care? Like go shop something there’s always bottle hand sanitiser entrance, people used use barely see anyone use it. see people lining, wait, where’s social distance? one cares. much people city it’s crowded fuck, covid already. State emergency longer effective, renaming it, hoping people might care again, won’t. Japan full shit. Totally antisocial Ok  approved next school year. They’re private schools anyway mandate they’d like. US cases canada want hybrid schedule. Covid fuck shit up, fuck shit someone line people pass to. Get protected literally soon possible — expanding risk window due personal preference totally needless. Paralysis choice friend — get another vaccine later you’re worried efficacy. mRNA absolute miracle!!  US crushing us vaccine rollout, that's established. new cases active cases per capita still bigger us, even 32% receiving first dose. We're reactive spike cases. US never locked imposed restrictions way did. like WFH! article implies it’s finished vaccine product drug substance. US provided drug substance Moderna vaccine EU supply chain too, spectacular. 

There simply production capacity within EU fulfill EU countries orders; exported, clear AstraZeneca needs rethink supply chain. new vaccines approved FDA yet (only granted emergency use authorization pending actual approval). There's precedent requiring vaccine approved. reason, even military requiring new vaccines approved. knew years, it’s undeniable Pretty sure latest lockdown little 'the height' vaccinations - one since.  Work going different kind cafe bar. nice break real WFH lol think that's ""52% population fully vaccinated, another 4% awaiting second dose""

They worded really poorly problem 100% arise part team office conversations making decisions remote employees left conversations impact performance bosses eventually say need back in. Unless everyone remote forced communicate using systems hybrid approach become communication issue. say makes reconsider even getting vaccine little. absolutely part passport systems. means forced live like I'm vaccinated isolated, what's point getting vaccinated? hurting point. idea shun part system I'll alone transmitting regardless vaccination status.

Still luck audio interview. I'm going call quits. late scrubbing many audio clips. Sorry finding it. California week can’t wait escape fire go it’s safer.

This phrase imagine months ago.

Good luck northern friends, hope things turn around quickly. Get first vaccination can. willing adults vaccinated . Whats left hesitant ones children 16 vaccinated yet age group affected, probably better get virus.   That's typical american workers days. best work. Work long hard hours extra everything in. guy. get fuck all.  touch key thing too: Companies insist full-time office presence almost necessarily going pay less companies full-time remote hybrid maintain large office space. Unless physical space presence *crucial*, putting disadvantage demanding presence. AstraZeneca dose delivered European Union considered blocking? 

Millions vaccine doses exported EU every month. AstraZeneca finally understands EU contract must considered, doesn’t mean doses blocked.

AstraZeneca signed contract committed supply doses EU without impact third party obligations. trying deliver EU follow contract blocking AZ enforcing contract. 

So: AstraZeneca delivers less planned EU, AstraZeneca delivers less planned countries outside EU. It’s called production problems bad planning blocking. Think way- human beings survival requires things roughly two categories:

- Basic resources (shelter, food, water)

- Protection threats (using tribes/collectives/warriors/vaccines/etc)

It's people *don't care*... *can't afford care.* There's big difference.

All social practices developed culture (and individually lifetime) uniquely form COVID punishes. abandon practices (or least modify deal COVID) requires *social replacement* practices formerly used to.

Any time ""rewrite code,"" expensive. applies software development, plane rollouts (ask Boeing hence 737 max fiasco), yes social/cultural rewrites. rewrites affordable, *you need generous social structure accommodate change.* means financially socially. 

Japan's government weakness often moves slowly. Resources dolled poor, vaccine distribution meh, overall real vision. Consider /u/lachalacha says:

They know COVID bad... eat/drink/hang pubs. fear represents threat, threat outweighed threat losing-social-potency/belonging-to-the-tribe restriction, staying home, etc: tribe smiles cares unlike shitty hypocritical government- sees you, interacts, trenches you, etc. way one could encouraged forgo tribe (to overcome COVIDs unique ability punish tribal behavior) governments stepped ensure people homeless, hungry, jobless, etc course happen. Social cultural norms- tribal monikers- consistent reliable times crisis governments. 

Perhaps another part humans hardwired view threat senses. angry bear pub, rattling rattlesnake... people would flee terror avoid place. Yet COVID could kill many... people forced see it, choose see it. your(and my) policymakers think we're stupid, mainly smart. kinda boils company announced going office 10 days month, special considerations less days personal reasons. think it’s great compromise everyone, it’s welcome change mandatory everyday office attendance requirements pushing pre-pandemic. typical. nice offer coors where's beer ? I’ve unemployed since July last year accepted role company currently remote, plans going back “all pod team members __have__ together” yet last year they’ve worked fine. refuse consider it. 

I’m frantically trying find company understands it’s unnecessary. Even going far interviewing role pays $15k less. want travel work That’s said month two. Hopefully everyone extremely easy access able reach issues like mentioned. main point shouldn’t keep restrictions still cases anti-vaxxers. true dat don’t need worry this. Side effects vary pretty widely know aren’t universal vaccines even close — hear people side effects there’s lot people logging say “I nothing report!” EU along India home largest vaccine manufacturing facilities planet. Countries like UK built still modest capacity less year, comparing EU UK makes sense. UK also spent millions developing sites EU one largest donors COVAX, part. 

The US also large manufacturing capacity, made clear day one would America first. 

The EU let would open capacity everyone legally put orders support COVAX. volte face adopt US stance puts countries position cant escape. weird kinda wanna wait vaccines Codagenix vaccine, live-attenuated vaccine, instead current ones primarily uses mRNA method? know effective either way. feel comfortable since mRNA new method. Enjoy job outsourced foreigner work half much. Vaccination status discussed regards grocery stores. mentioned payment status response saying stores want check status door. 'technically could done', I've heard mastercard say could done think come that. let's get shit done take 2 hour lunch extra time catch up! ADHD sympathize every day life like since born. Far obsessed, happy he's fading obscurity. However, he'll always good reminder strive for. problem!

Also flair fuck Well, paid earlier doses agree 100% changed careers official yesterday morning; way going back office told pre-pandemic well Can't imagine anyone Kent knows what's going currently tbh It’s already clear connections social elements job weigh heavier “good” non-union settings. also *many* fields performance subjective, situational extremely difficult calculate. Clearly defined, company-public information pay levels certain types work transparent fair way compensate employees. Lmao. know you’re trying here

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s exactly nuanced... I’m saying it’s cheap, always good. think it’s due combination things:

A) at-risk people like healthcare workers, elderly, people immunocompromised pre-existing conditions getting vaccinated. 

B) Less cases reported groups listed main people going asymptomatic testing. 

C) Hospitals getting better treating virus less people ending ventilator and/or dying. number quickly change unemployment returns normal mean US-centric dumpster fire subreddit mocked quite often subs hivemind correct info? Absurd! Hate say it’s starting look like Canada worse US. vaccination program going great is.... lagging. variant problem control, especially British Columbia. One roommates going California week can’t wait escape fire go it’s safer. manager myself, sounds ideal. I'm running adult day care, call need help want bang drum awesome thing did.

Kills people put things like ""going doctor's appointment, make time later"". outcomes, hours worked. environment top Emergent leadership tolerated even encouraged flouting federal standards manufacturing marketing next month, records indicate, workers making AstraZeneca’s vaccine deviated manufacturing standards average three times day. one-fifth deviations classified AstraZeneca’s said Emergent repeatedly loosened monitoring criteria appeared meet them, resorting measures like “historical averages.” even failed tests, report Another internal investigation August found Emergent approved four raw materials used produce AstraZeneca’s vaccine without first fully testing them. type shortcut, called conditional release material, occurred average twice week October, internal logs Plant supervisors often cited pressures Operation Warp Speed justification glossing violations manufacturing guidelines, according one former company official. even Emergent launched Covid-19 vaccine production, major client charged firm complacent follow-up audit February 2020, Soligenix auditors said “the primary driver” mistake Emergent fostered “a culture written instructions regularly followed Sometime February, Emergent workers unknowingly contaminated Johnson &amp; Johnson’s viral vector AstraZeneca’s. error discovered weeks, until, one final checks release, Johnson &amp; Johnson sampled batch 13 million 15 million doses’ worth vaccine purity. No. Many people trial didn’t report symptoms still 94% effective. mention could still side effects come near future. There’s bias side effect reports online people experience side effects much likely share online don’t notice much. Consider lucky  Atleast someone taking precautions India's covid rise, india isn't. important accepted people enough doubts vaccines already think anyone Germany wants politicians deciding vaccine safe not. far german experts like StiKo lot cautious EMA EMA approve unlikely would. EMA also slow data filed, still case Sputnik V. ""lockdown"" first real, honest post I’ve seen whole thread. 

My thoughts -6 months people work office schedules managers set overlap make sure coverage every day week. 

After go 2-3 day week based specific job &amp; seniority. That’s actually impossible. 

Source: comments sub last year. usually great. not. blacked one point.  got roofied. evidence parents watching kids spreading covids? Oh God, remember telling people logistic curves called logistic reason, almost manufacturing process scales linearly time. told two months ago expect vaccine earlier middle next year adopted policy giving second shot everyone first am, fully vaccinated True, sounds scarily accurate absolutely don’t care. Never catch wearing mask outside; hiking trail? That’s crazy. Folks peer pressure refuse risk minimal. think would definitely worse hit 1918 sure. reason bad due medical advancements NPIs. Fuck right?

I mean supposed quit I’m cushy job lol. Maybe could drive around 45 minutes starting shift walk treadmill work? don’t get hate. didn’t plan work home due pandemic. I’m inherently lazy situation in. go work different setting now, spend time dog cool. Americans can’t even go Canada right now, unless family essential worker. don’t think anyone planning trips Canada first half year begin lol. Well things could still change little. suspect things like mask mandates eventually essentially proven work. gf first moved Florida lived travel trailer probably year moving 10 months moving barely 290 sq feet. Depends union negotiates. last union job pay grades based seniority. 2 years one grade, 2-5 another grade, 5-9 another grade 10-15 another, on. 

You'd get yearly raises, variation within pay grades, wide. grand max, paid someone higher seniority grade. 8 years ton work someone else 15, might getting paid cap seniority grade they're getting paid bottom theirs, they're still making you. 

Compared average non-union pay field, pay significantly higher overall whole point unions. definitely sucked getting paid 2/3 someone else getting paid longer work.  Office workers want go back cube stuck lol. based science. SARS-CoV-2 honestly probably worse Spanish Flu, things equal.

We’re much better general care (don’t think ventilators IV fluids back then), even importantly better sanitation antibiotics deal secondary infections. [they need Leronlimab  think apply domestic travel

Again, necessarily. I'm rando, think taking away available give back carrot actually good thing?

You're asking absolute answer exist. Like things, imagine depends think skepticism would raised action?

It probably would be, specific context talking about.

I probably get going, *will* suggest think changing trip next week something like driving one. always original trip later, protecting others duty now. Slipping always possible undo, sadly. unrealistic level nuance social media. Right... NZ government Karl Rock- ""Nahi Chahia Ji"" source that? I’m saying you’re wrong that’s pretty huge feel like would’ve heard it. Oh nice CEO company made mention returning office today everybody dead silent response. seems think culture go back was, since covid bunch us laid off, others quit, several others moved places far enough away they'd need stay remote.

I'm going back couple days week, culture made office good place dead. 😮‍💨 Without that, see convince us go back. fake moral superiority canadians always funny see. expensive Boston? Welcome fighting shots kids! I've definitely gotten less done past year working home, biggest factor kids schooling home spouse trying run business home too. Coordinating time work responsibilities home exhausting. 

I also started new job months lock started learning curve new company stalled feel like really even started understand company operates build working relationships coworkers. certainly enjoyed commuting, home advantages, productivity one them. got less interruptions office communication much easier faster person. I'm hoping hybrid setup, going office project site days per week starting June kids school. Yooooo anybody heard Mr. Trudeau? BOLO! slowest vaccine rollout advanced nation.

I disagree you, fact know nothing Japan's situation.

But damn, general feeling everyone saying place X (X place focus moment debate) terrible response covid, worst rollout, data etc? would really, really like know people think would good response, fast rollout, reliable data. sore arm mild headache first shot, headache went away overnight arm soreness faded three days. Right pandemic started quit job working underpaid sys admin local college went work sys engineer consultant private company six figures. office I’ve twice interview pickup computer paperwork ai hired. working comfy home office underwear anime porn background going weird . intentions quitting though, moneys good hired one top paid engineers stones ask money normal. People we're saying years vaccinate planet we're moving fast Bill Gates like like.

""I think end 2022 latest entire pandemic packed globally nobody even cares COVID anymore"" Nobody talks great Canadian healthcare is, talk great don’t directly pay like States. big difference. I've read others subreddit, paid per dose ($56/dose) countries like US paid less (~$20/dose). They're also [giving Pfizer medical 98% population. locked since Christmas Ireland, non essential business services (no click collect), sports activities, everyone else working home, even schools fully open next week.

Our cases mostly people mixing indoors rules many fed restrictions stopped complying fully Honestly US it’s usual selfish self, thinking AGAIN!! Shame them; need start giving excess supply IMMEDIATELY!!!  Yea please  bet 2% either sales management Yep, true enough. Chicago recently got option add transit card Apple wallet tap enter turnstiles. 

I think couple reasons- looong time ago NFC (paywave) cards came around institutions probably thought expensive “the young people” users. also recall period time late 00s large concern around wireless skimming going on. Several cards back 00s it. 0/3 physical cards posses little ))) icon. Probably another thing would scale converting card machines USA contactless would expensive institution side merchant side. It’s super common days I’d agree took forever catch here. remember seeing SE Asia years ago thinking “wow that’s kinda cool..” may changed gloves arrived, know that.

At CVS, someone back filling syringes Pfizer bringing box person giving it. Made things quicker (that's got it.)

A family member got Pfizer hospital site, filled syringe bottle giving.

It depends site system, almost guarantee someone onsite filled syringes Pfizer bottle. bottles transported frozen, unthawed, like CVS, dedicated person filling syringes handing streamline things.

I worry hygiene honestly, likely took old gloves, sanitized, put new gloves removing safety tip opening bandaid. move quickly places.

Cheers! Brazilian banks already pre-COVID. many still don't.  don’t disagree, plenty companies 5-10 year leases. Especially “credit” tenants, larger firms. lot european cities easily accessible stalls and/or public restrooms. Rather quit collect unemployment that's cool! I’m sure media screaming BEACHES right report this. data awesome. also matches anecdotal experience. Pfizer experienced arm pain minor fatigue. Several friends Moderna severe side effects (but still bad overall). truly hot take jiblett. 

Thanks taking time shame people cannot magically find work within 5 mile radius live. would useful developing universal flu vaccine people want 3 hour commute like hole head. US might better thanks natural immunity. We're ~2 months behind Israel atm terms doses administered relative population. Sinovac thing available moment. CNN reporting moment, US already 2,464 deaths. happen. hire 1/4 people clean India messed up. (Which already happening) still come ahead. I’ve company six years love here. required go back office 5x week, I’m leaving. work hot field (private equity accounting) recruiters contacting times week finding new job won’t hard. 

My work individual project based maybe one two meetings week there’s absolutely need office one two days week. Less 24 hours me—got shot 2:30 one afternoon felt totally normal besides sore muscle shot went noon next day. Fairly high fever, aches, chills, nausea side effects. sore arm didn’t completely disappear 5 days came went time didn’t even notice it. Last month like one week back?   feel you. commute work bad, mind hopping train 2x week head back office things ""return normal."" drive (Chicago), fuck entirely. get much ""me"" time train (reading, podcasts, thinking) could never car. Plus, office gym super nice miss too. 

Also, know probably looking new job right now. hate current position genuinely like company, non-profit. need money. I'm absolutely petrified ""virtual interviews."" In-person causes enough stress life. Yes. work hospital. cousin got infected 2 weeks first dose. saying vaccine since lot factors consider I'm implying brain fog still there. union seven years. They're terrible. never go back one. Despite 100s thousands lost job income impinged significant way result [poor handling of] pandemic, saddening learn many people feel **this level entitlement** #selfishassholes. Yeah yeah, get inclination reported, intent, still .. Settle Dwight. Offices jails extra steps What? US media different story.  use funds send effective vaccines directly here. also mentioned exactly blind study, people known got reaction vaccine not. people vax group probably less careful reason. Someone calculations NY problem lot companies lot office space might way easily ditch lease out, justify costs associated office space making people go back. 

Any reason wanting employees back office bullshit, we’ve proven last year jobs don’t need done office.

Not fucking chance set foot office again. lovely upside working home. love hear it. kids upside getting sleep saving 26.7 hours month travel time. live far office traffic that's time saving. Also I'm coming 9 leaving 5. I'll come needed (without traffic 15 minute drive less) leave I'm done.

If sit traffic that's work time far I'm concerned. Same. office wildly social. I’m super introvert anyway tend prefer alone time. day office, I’m exhausted socialization office mixed train commute engulfed people. Working home best. know boss wants everyone back I’m searching high low new job, know ever actually get work done 

They don't. That's secret business. Seriously, wants deal people again? depends, think. staff 10 everyone largely works different schedules people either never rarely overlap. used monthly in-person staff meeting hassle everyone (it would fall people’s days off, others meant getting work hour early, etc) resentful them. Covid, we’ve gone biweekly zoom staff meeting we’re much cohesive staff result. 66% remote workers say they’d rather return office full time quit job. jobs blow donkey dick President Jose Biden authorized federal unemployment benefits So, 34% remote workers lose jobs &amp; thrived throughout pandemic paying less commute costs &amp; expenses even entitled. really makes sad family died months ago getting shot. almost cried 15 minute waiting period thinking family make it. ~50% recollection. Yes, clearer, thanks.

Indeed, feeling like terrible hangover 36 hours seems fairly common! guess immune system kicking in.

At least know placebo immune response!  Utah reopens April 10th. confess enjoy teaching much online. could couple years, would fantastic.😁 Milk. young people starting careers trying build network connect mentors. Also, juxtapose stats huge percentages people experiencing burnout. WFH part bringing burnout me. Poor boundaries, limited sunlight, limited social interaction, pure hell. also thoroughly paying cooking food day. They’re making compelling argument employers let stay home without work. Sounds like good way lose job numbers  Welcome century. least guys castles. :) Small gatherings.

They said fully avoid medium large sized ones may 1 non vaccinated visitor want go mask-less. got fixed back. old mods came back new subreddit, r/covid19science, closed Wouldn’t recommend taking vaccine ran it😂 I've working home since March 2020 I'm ready go back.  miss around people.
My health gone shit, feel lazy, I'm less productive.  tell reason leaving, too. Yes, several experimental mRNA cancer treatments. Since 2018, Biontech also developed mRNA influenza Zika vaccines cooperation Pfizer. Normally, takes years develop approve vaccines. Covid mRNA vaccine first produced mass scale urgency pandemic. windows? :D I've UK years. quit job allow work home 2 days week looked work closer home, partner psychotic episode travelling 2 hours day sought help 2 months later pandemic hits whole office work home 4 months. 

Still kinda salty. Yeah extremely awkward considering exported 60m majority grants poor countries. Imagine ashamed countries hoarding it. Even pre-covid think smart thing do, even without ""benefit"" shorter commute coworkers still going close restaurants, nightlife, etc. world re-opens.

That require advocating coworkers get stuck commuting again. Yeah USA literal shithole. Americans like savages conditioned soldiers truck drivers. Brainwashed much Chinese are. imagine make applying jobs harder too, applicant pool always huge. also keep mind demographic actually responds surveys skews results. There’s certain type person it’s likely people pander and/or believe anything MSM says. facts you, haha. 
And science. Yeah, IKEA desk chair front room wife setup dining room. chair killing though. actually went back office first time weeks ago like ""ugh, chair! miss it!"" Damn long ago! think iPhone 3GS 4 time. also iPhone 4 came 2010! Thank explaining entire manufacturing, assembly distribution process know whas agenda sub has, imagine US care all, vaccine suspended asap least young people. Clearly, ""best"" vaccine... people depressed going back work places confinment ever caused. mean probably still would prefer job, no? Unemployment pay well, even pandemic boosters. Always childfree shits bad takes completely miss point.

No one saying regret children, moron, impossible work next them.  Working home watching toddler alone wife works hospital hell.

But soon he's gonna go back preschool work home... alone.

Those 2% people still assholes basically point. couldn’t right. means recurring payments push rather pull auth fund transfer. incredible! proud US vaccination program! Agreed, I'm confused people seem understand suspend requirement unemployment COVID infections exploding simultaneously back 2020. rather quit stuck home nothing gets done. right choice, pay attention ""best vaccine one get first shut go get it""... Wisconsinite idea going Minnesota cheaper alcohol laughable 😂 vaccine made UK? cheques pretty old tech, UK probably didnt invest tech means fund transfer.

US recently got tap pay, rest world since 2010. data transferred server Ohio server Ohio server farm. still trust AstraZeneca vaccine :/ expect July/August latest - prioritized time school trial data amazing. Fine hear. It’s ideal, making work.

I one would like start new job virtually, new hires entry level Domain Heads hired never met person. Man, thinking conversion living spaces seems like huge task, especially much empty office space could be. thinking maybe companies space Loop future due lower prices. said see people (I've worked whole pandemic) actually starting feel bit normal. use public transport every day now. seen entire pandemic sweden beginning. 

I use mostly rush hour cannot remember seeing 3 people masks full bus. previous video reflection situation public transport specially march month. 

This another video stockholm, mid March 2021, story mentioned people masks almost video public transport everybody wearing masks, please post it, would love see that, experience haven't.

I watch videos countries see people masked everywhere. UK, Spain, France.... following through. sweden, video showing something different, please post it. Yeah see work time socialize. Sometimes strategic time goes nowhere. Plus time spend talking less time spend ""working"".  Oh okay thanks information waiting someone else say ^
The difference cube color beige, grey 🤷🏻‍♂️ otherwise spot on. way! Pretty much described it. got back deployment lockdowns mandatory quarantines began (horrible timing). didn’t wear uniform 2 months. Granted, none equipment back didn’t really work. got it, slowly started picking up. started squad pt instead company pretty nice. Masks small “bubble teams” rules almost one followed. Towards September business usual, except really cracked using masks. things still affected PCSs schools low slots quarantines.

As AIT soldiers, new people told us training cut shortened. shut pie hole let people take risks they're willing take? state state basis there. Here's outdated Ohio report I've also seen something similar Washington state. P1 frontline healthcare workers only

P2 open persons age 60, well essential workers (of 28 categories), people age 18 congregated settings prisons, care homes shelters, well 18 work educational institutions positions specified elsewhere essential. *People work tourism hospitality also able register vaccination point.*
Anybody age 18 co-morbidities, - far I’m aware - must specified DOH, may vaccinated P2 well. Full details likely released clearer idea vaccines directed sites wide net cast.

P3 free-for-all. Almost definitely going J&amp;J unless you’re allergic something unforeseen occurs. 

We hopefully won’t run similar issue factory US certainly aren’t manufacturing one vaccine. depends quickly get liquid doses Europe. 

Botswana low population density relatively small number active cases moment - they’ve even opened hunting season. Many countries East, West Central Africa right towards Egypt currently experiencing surges moment, Southern Africa hasn’t seen third wave yet. less open kids SA back school while. However, still mask mandates unless outdoors, (fairly lenient) curfews limitation number people permitted particular gatherings. thing categorically cannot moment attend live sporting event. 

Here’s hoping current trend continues don’t see third wave all. What's stopping joining clubs seeing friend groups time saved commuting. Work place socializing.  MHRA yellowcard reports vaccine side effects published weekly since vaccinations began. 79 clots 19 deaths 20 million vaccines like looking proverbial needle haystack. also consistent rate clots general population. takes time identify research cases establish trend.

The rate clots apparently higher Norway Germany noticed trend sooner made first reports. soon issued alert, MHRA began investigating data. 

There's big cover here. Idk, 1,000 seems important tbh sure article triggered much, reports reality US' SARS-COV-2 variant makeup. I'm sure know B117 spreads easily prior variants, spreads among children, may slightly higher hospitalization death rate. That's fearmongering, simply information help making informed decisions. outsourced couple projects past, extremely simple, like solving captchas. code huge mistake, still dealing consequences. simply much cultural divide, language barrier. ones speak good english cost nearly much American.  nice protects foreign competition, domestic competition. Someone mid-west example, wages typically much lower costal areas, could still seen preferable hire higher income areas demand greater price tag. pay someone California NY $200k/year pay someone interior $120k/year? they're 100% WFH, there's reason to.

If 100% WFH becomes thing, drive competition suitable industries away higher-income areas towards lower ones. guess good bad depending side line happen standing on. took second, read again, keeping mind ""5"" looks like ""S"" ""3"" looks like ""E"". Nobody likey worky Sounds like need fired replaced adult. numbers linked article.

You read article. Orlando getting close situation. many walk mass vaccination sites run supply 5 pm enough people going. last friends get vaccinated able easily get appointments CVS Publix within days. I'm also scared many extra! ...What? fact parents grandparents generation able buy house, car raise kids single middle class income. 

I keep seeing can’t find anything back up. nominal wages remained same, wouldn’t case? employees afford live anywhere near city

you pay employees more. wouldn’t isn’t work. nonsensical statistic think point *bad* joke. Penalty shoot outs reserved knockout stages tournaments. 76.4% Americans 65 gotten least one dose. 57.4% completed regimen. Around 80% deaths Americans 65. make much sense see massive drop overall deaths incredibly wide scale vaccination effort. great stuff. think we'll begin see very, tiny death counts point majority Americans fully vaccinated. I'm MD within DC beltway. We've fairly serious lockdown last year. local COVID numbers still really high. ate outdoor restaurant first time last weekend, although restaurants open weeks. I'm 2 weeks second COVID vaccine today, husband another weeks. using public transportation eating indoor restaurants gathering indoors others we're fully vaccinated. someone worked remotely Covid little human contact none, I'd gladly quit go office point. wouldn’t isn’t work. nonsensical statistic. ignorant statement. Lockdowns get lifted period time allow resumptions economic activity. cases rise lockdown put effect again. done get maximum effect viral spread reduction also keeping economic activity high possible. didn’t luxury working home industry’s shutdown. Went without work nearly 8 months. opportunity work full time job home I’d sure consider lucky......Crazy think midst COVID someone would willing quit stable job would go back office. Vatican City I’ve seeing people say they’re gonna wear masks time even pandemic even aren’t sick don’t believe it. you’re sick, alright. find hard believe wearing mask hours time year ideal people. Anyone else seeing this? mean want to, knock out. couldn’t imagine seeing people walking germs time Lol who's 2%? wish people weren’t downvoting this, it’s legitimate point discuss. Cases going long, far. Even vaccine all, might still seeing deaths falling “catch up” massive decline spread stopped weeks ago. 

I think right precipice seeing whether death rate divorced case rate vaccine. deaths still falling like 2 weeks it’ll clear. don’t think it’s clear right now. Co-working spaces: worked remotely 4 years previous company, helps lot. POLITICO Anybody else missing seemingly daily updates COVID vaccine numbers US summary within? really enjoy updates definitely important know estimated reach 69.420% vaccinated Lol OK ya got me. Yep, possible way small town residents could ever high-falootin fancy pants ""Interwebs"" jobs, sir. stay right shit-kickin lane, amirite? Yeah think lot descriptions wish lists. LinkedIn jobs apply things. lot places want resume two years ago:

I see advertisement stating ""Make $2,000 week working home."" think ""what kind morons fall scams?""

Me today:

""If try send back office I'm walking."" wonder would’ve different number pre-pandemic?

I never opportunity telework before. Even could’ve told started, good luck stopping it.

It doesn’t make sense force people office full-time unless there’s proof reduced productivity.  land border need show negative test self quarantine home 14days. canadian must let in.
If fly tricky book hotel quarantine 3 days self quarantine home 11 days.
You certainly go help mother self quarantine place. Holy shit sounds annoying seems it'd cheaper live city said done... hear lot know take advantage slack fire find someone need babyset paid manager. people enjoy talking fellow humans (their coworkers)

your mileage may vary US government

TIL Notre Dame = US government. know lead surge? changed towards end February? Meaning current trends continue, end May adults gotten vaccine Massachusetts want one. obviously outlier cases people *can't* get vaccines medical reasons, vaccination effort ""completed"" early June 80% adults able get least one dose middle May. Yeah, Latin American countries fantastic job. Brazil would look like New Zealand right someone else election /s drive 35-40 mins ways, sucks. Won’t staying job much longer Given recent CDC study said Pfizer Moderna vaccines 90% protective infections, means 90% lower bound reduced transmissibility. virus, cannot transmit it.

However, say 90% lower bound, even people vaccinated catch virus, viral load likely lot lower, symptoms likely lot less serious, makes virus much less transmissible. vaccines likely reduce transmission 90%. 

Can put insane ""vaccines might reduce transmission"" even incorrect, understandable misinterpretation ""vaccines reduce transmission"" bed?

I'm worried CDC long-lasting damage economy pushing inane talking point continue hear. fully expect allowed work home. reason office. life infinitely enjoyable way. can’t telework, I’ll switch employers Looks good. Like said curious. population ca. I'm getting voted asking questions. guess asked it. prefer office also quiet space work since wife second bedroom. Maybe would option return, not. I've always found interesting tsunami caused thousands deaths got virtually attention compared reactor, caused one death.

It's great example media makes rare causes death sound common common causes death sound rare. Right Covid company started huge office expansion project. it’s year newly renovated expanded office sitting mostly empty still. CEO emailed us January height pandemic US telling company people could go office. think he’s little upset spent money one using it.  always Jeff pandemic proved go full time jobs. like plague basically ended servitude middle ages pandemic end 5 day week office jobs. Oof, sucks you. Never case me, hope something happens future changes mind got J&amp;J morning- hour ago nowhere chills, aches- uhhhg looking forward tonight tomorrow went back school two years ago, public University California, prove vaccinations bunch things provide tiders. think like MMR, Chicken Pox, Hep B, TB. 

Adding Covid list seems reasonable moment. national beer day? celebrate beer sure! 😁 got first shot week half ago. decent arm pain night day after, side effects. Dang, wanna know conspiracy was. even understand people need work office. work change lot people. company probably saves money kind Medeco hardware.

I'm project directly, know well going user perspective, can't talk much back-end config due employment NDA 'company secrets methods'. Also lower Latin America look excess deaths rather recorded deaths. lot Brazil's neighbours harder time keeping records damage virus caused, things got bad places start using cardboard coffins (Ecuador, example).

A eastern European countries also getting deaths per capita *right now.* company different depends job guess. deadlines long meet one really cares I'm hoping US done vaccinating everyone throw way. Thanks!

Yes. teenagers home awesome. Family dinner every night. Tons quality time. 

Enjoy! US government can't force anyone get vaccine, even military since vaccine emergency use authorization, colleges different? 


You can't compare vaccines tested decades full FDA approval new vaccine fully approved. approved different  alone absolutely hate working home ? live small town go ever want car 2-10 minutes. lunch dinner home work shifts. 

I hate zoom much, also single alone home, life much better going , seeing people drive car around. 

No don’t want work home :( Ironically AZ lagging little behind, seems picking steam week. AZ manufactured Fiocruz. also Sinovac produced Butantã (dubbed “Coronavac”).

Last time checked coronavac accounts like 80% vaccinations Brazil. confirm DC well. Also didnt productivity actually go many workers working home? That's win win everyone. go UC Berkeley Chancellor said vaccinations would required fall. would surprised UC-wide thing. any, don’t want any. Sorry view work escape sort kids. Also sorry joke don’t lol. Good luck trip! funny thing done work traveling ever leading pandemic. literally flew Wed, Thurs Friday one week. left state 18 months. look forward department yearly get together hoping fall home office.

I cant lie - love home get kids school (the oldest drive, younger ones busses - different schools) get home. want quit find remote work! That’s going whole bunch people unemployment insurance again. employers arseholes. dying able work home last year due risk, told it’s possible.

For context, admin occupational health company, behind times due digitised system.

Then, around November time, us take time isolate sudden, working home possible, suits business. short lived, back full time month half, starting Jan last UK lockdown started. worked really well, work even better digitised system becomes thing (if ever happened.)

I need move soon complicated situation involving partners job, asked employer whether working home would possible future permanent basis, due distance I’d travelling wasting ton money petrol.

I hinted don’t allow there’s good chance I’m going leave hands tied.

Of course, answer no, I’m leaving soon I’ve finalised new house, warned completely front honest. earn way elsewhere, perhaps even treated like human being...

We furloughed quite too, strong feeling company abusing system told workload diminished due us clinics remotely (that’s changed since April, onsite now) profits still good. furloughed due lesser amount work, simply save company money.

Anyway, companies can’t see benefits remote working, don’t stay job. Find employer let flexible, you’ll much happier. Don’t get pushed around, deserve better. That’s feel anyway, it’s employers loss end day Deaths per capita probably better measure since ever test fraction true cases. course, perfect metric. hope quit gave 1 day notice, complained said ""it coulda nothing."" wish office would something full-time office hours telework. Maybe office one day every three months would work. would go back office work middle management removed. single toxic aspect white collar office work. Fucking parasites repeat me: ""In Monica Gandhi trust. Monica Gandhi trust."" I’m Dallas TX, seems like largely everyone wants shot get one, gotten one. Apparently county registry empty, mass vaccination site pretty much opening first come first serve basis.

There also several smaller sites operating manner area. Several city officials seem like practically begging people come get vaccinated.

I...dunno good bad. human trial going worldwide robust testing FDA could do.  I'm going indoors metal show September. I've never looked forward concert much. slow vaccine rollout result botched federal procurement process resulted vaccine rollout essentially stalled month + flip flopping provincial leaders restrictions point became caricature + highly transmissible variants rude you’re one doesn’t seem understand works. 

“However, currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines live vaccines therefore safely administered immunocompromised people.... people immunosuppressive therapy still receive COVID-19 vaccination”

Unless better constant pattern going past year. Remember southern US totally getting covid outbreak? got covid outbreak. people claimed reddit testing death rate go ... death rate went up. This. trial fire, far vaccines holding pretty damn well. Difference 32% Americans already got first dose provides significant level protection, fact they're approaching level means there's still higher infection rate among non-vaccinated folk. [More end February. mRNA technology actually new. studied 20 - 30 years now. first pandemic we're get utilize it. remember people saying 'The U.S. take 5 years vaccinate everyone rate' like two days vaccination effort

Technically true moment. Imagine consultant russian vaccine makers would make study 12 people Moscow claim Pfizer effective. like lot people expect valid opinion Texas. Especially Texans. Great. roommate risking bringing variant Cali. Thanks damned much :/ post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

Overpopulation begets poverty begets lack education begets overpopulation begets poverty ....... u get point. 

People blame govt whereas reality govt reflection people democracy. Corrupt uneducated people corrupt uneducated people power whine instead trying change themselves. Trading life privacy.

Priorities. don’t choke sour grapes, washing hands goes long way job difficult home quality contact low. clients severe mental illness lack tech telemedicine tho given grant help that. me, it’s diminishing potential impact. home, look good paper, that’s enough me. could right. Different populations, different habits, different traditions, different initial R numbers. much anymore. vaccine suspended? drugs stopped form side effects rare issues that's lot prescription drugs. Passover already? grew communist country way word ""lockdown"" used westerners always makes laugh. lawyer medical doctor understand proper scientific data judge effective vaccine would also need placebo group course Hungary, also much less information people since regular patients privacy protections anyone else EU like volunteers study agreed share private medical information. Israel deal BioNTech/Pfizer agreed share medical information course would completely different legal frame work. 

In regards capacity, Sputnik V mRNA vaccine places able produce license. read ago company East Germany wanted produce it, yesterday article Bavaria already signing preliminary contract 2.5m doses would produced Bavaria would expected July. yeah produce soon get any, tho July probably still need produce production capacity general would good everyone around word. Even Merkel right everyone wants vaccinated gets option end summer large parts world would still benefit increase available vaccines. So... build wall, make Floridians pay it? 66% parents don’t remember credible expert ever saying this. lot experts thought would take longer develop vaccine. Russia could start delivering June, still Q2 EU done vaccinating even summer. severely lacking vaccines. cannot overstated much EU lacking vaccines. Russia stated they'd able deliver enough doses 50 million people, 100 million doses months ago, manufacturing capacity low. Now, signed contracts produce almost 1.5 billion doses year definitely help Q2 Q3 deliveries. even wuthout that, 100 milliok doses huge help. Dual citizens. What's funny first school make announcement (in Texas maybe country wide) St. Edward's Catholic university. University Notre Dame (also Catholic) said would required well. Thanks! gap two right small though. state/province level, numerous states better half provinces right now. Bolsonaro fucking idiot. little late responding problem exacerbated denying COVID-19 thing. poverty idiocrasy. People genuinely give F Covid. surprised government still giving damn, unlike people. Seems like lost. r/drama basement dweller. see, using two different brands vaccines doesnt affect side effetcts - follow-up shot fx Biontech side effects associated well know. 

What less well known (or proven) mixing long vaccine protect person. Northern sons Elks. don’t think understand works... buddy Crohn’s patient question. person seems strong immunosuppressants would affect efficacy vaccine. Also, every given population small subset people can’t take vaccine. It’s assumed herd immunity would protect vulnerable anyway always thought of... yeah. that. Australia lately caught almost forgetting going elsewhere world. one vaccinated 40 days state without single case. Private schools different. Abbott, much dismay, can't enforce private schools like St. Ed's started announcing plans. Israel important again? CDC recommends vaccine people immunocompromised. way? Conventional population density known bad kind things, that's absolutely controversial said source sent places well. tell me, wrong population-weighted density? Because? say basic explanation. Personally, fully vaccinated, I'm gonna go get many doctors appointments done whatnot P1 widespread east coast. It'll soon, likely. Leave ingrate fucks.   Canada’s new cases per capita almost equal US, multiple provinces including BC higher new cases per capita California. Total cases isn’t relevant current situation.

I’d feel lot safer California BC right myself. Soon Alabama!! Social skills also important bringing business company.

If good social skills, chances people meet outside work may need something come business trust you.

Word mouth important business. ""Selling yourself"" were. 319$ public transport, holy shit thats insane. pay 1€ day Nothing wrong vitamin insane rant vaccines fucking necessary bud. seriously think need donate money buy Fox News.

I calculated out, based monthly donations Biden last year, could buy controlling interest Fox News less 2 years said donations. COVID-19 cases, information prevalence long-haulers cohort? biggest worry after-effects one would get coronavirus (e.g., neurological haze, tinnitus (ringing ears), lethargy, etc.). live rest life would really really really suck. Well

They hv trying. 
Unlike countries, denied existence coronavirus, 
And denied wear mask. Yes takes account theoretical 100% immunity exposed individuals, vaccine ever 100% effective complicated variants may evade immunity variants transmissible recently employee poll, 60% staff never want go back office 2% said wanted go back 5 days week. 

Oh damn, that's lot. company poll think 60% said wanted return office 2-3 days work rest home. tiny minority (I think less 5%) wanted go entirely remote.

The next week talked boss staying remote coming office twice month + needed training whatever. 3000 cases country 100 million? think take step back remember justification pandemic. number concern detested working home. home sanctuary don’t like bringing work stress vibes it. like up, showered, dressed, world. Also, partner department 100% WFH issues us. appreciate given choice respect ones we’ve made ourselves. think problem people lot C-level people came sales sort. Sales absolutely cannot done well remotely lot reasons won’t go here. background seeing kind things able work home, don’t translate non customer facing jobs could remote. country referring to? US new legislation like monthly blocking trans rights. Trans people jump hoops get need.

 Maybe religious exemption signing piece paper saying religion. money saved commuting nice ~45 minutes either side worth triple that

Can’t imagine losing time Yes aren’t weird social interaction doesn’t cause us freak fuck time.  work school?! sick shit. thing me. man replaced hyped job enough work two people. struggled fit 37.5h week pandemic much do...

Now, get work done much less time. course, still clock hours figure, long get tasks done one waiting (unnecessarily), fine watch occasional episode Netflix would spent chatting colleagues coffee anyway, haha. Mandatory return working full time office: Nov. 2.

Life good.  Apparently degens brought wacky Brazil covid Van fucking us Damn son death numbers coming Brazil trustworthy? even mention 15% recovered? shown possible get Covid even already it? No, would it? old manager pointed didn’t make sense company perspective already working ten hour days five days week, company would losing out. 🙄 would dream though. bashing EU hoping caves demands. hope get UK US cave demand. Lol yes is. dude worked high school came work high fuck everyday flipped toast however many hours. done lot them, takes absolutely zero skill work many minimum wage jobs. Trump called “Limey Flu.” Germany people literally protesting government allowed know important health information vaccination purposes.... Well society going get vaccinated move on. first dominos fall, many institutions come soon I’m sure. point you’re moron prefer play COVID odds widen proven safe vaccine. going there, I'd certainly getting vaccine dumb shit president pulled garden party. think got Covid troubles too. coworkers want go back commuting bizzare me. work lab different still. kids guess want time away chaos.

I kids. I'm going in. company decided anybody need 4 days week get office need come in. one leads pushing coming week just... Because? Lol they're gona come want others well. 

No. corporate tells come I'm coming in. headline says what? People know statistics?

Yes, pretty spot never approved EU matter good bad is. both?  Ooh valid point. I’ll let know said that. Ok, Vietnam, shares land border China. reality strong public health infrastructure, suppressive interventions, national healthcare systems put halt spread countries, really anything island status (except maybe Taiwan correctly closed borders early). UK also island national healthcare system done abominably. reality everyone followed models instead reckless disregard human life west, pandemic would mostly now. still gotten donut. Maybe tomorrow dose two. Ahhh. Alberta... Texas Canada.  really said ‘fuck it’, smh. Everyone know Florida right now. :( Germany real lockdown. I'm German study UK, UK taped supermarket aisles ""non essential"" things like cutlery prevent people going supermarket ""for fun"". reason use office bring knowledge together colaborative way. brain power put issue projects managed working remote reason to.  got Johnson Johnson deactivated virus, mRNA. mom intermittent tinnitus ever since corona virus, happens mostly whenever gets sinus issues. doc says dangerous related bp, deformity nerve gets close artery sinus inflammation. never happened covid. like sound show movies, like hear heartbeat.

The two mentioned fixed active lifestyle healthy diet. sure numbers added together?

In country people coronavirus vaccinated, case Israel? ""The UK ordered 40 million doses Pfizer vaccine 17 million Moderna jab also agreements several companies jabs still waiting approval, including 100 million doses Valneva 30 million Janssen."" Next pandemic cake walk  make adjustments vaccination plan, partly response pretty valid criticisms. PA still refusing mega sites near Philly lazy county employees want control everything, way fix complain. It’s travelers India, Indians. Even face value, death count 3 per cent new cases, low? current strains emerged mass vaccinations, still know current ""leaky"" vaccines work curent variants concern. mass vaccinations could force virus mutate dangerous way, i.e. immune escape. watch for. Wait Israel fully open, give time variants emergeand/or establish watch cases going up. do, herd immunity, congratulate Israel. people wouldnt shut avout Sweden imposing lockdowns measures. They’re pretty silent now. That's case US, though COVID recently already contributing herd immunity. big difference socializing work though. latter like seniors go doctor even though nothing wrong lonely. assume NZ has, ever open borders ? 

NZ points based immigration system, adjusted needs economy. Something US developed years ago. NZ needs immigration, since many NZers, particular skilled ones, leave country. Roughly 1 million live outside outside 4 million inside.

You research, know nothing country choose make racist decisive comment. Interesting, would hope people look past posted headlines read articles cause kinda watched conference live unless I’m practicing quantum leaps PM defiantly announced AstraZeneca longer recommended 50s.
What exactly headlines saw read?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* little Pfizer vaccine government hitched hopes AstraZeneca Novovax (which still phase 3 trials...) 

Now try source stocks Pfizer time literally every country. lol shoot already. Religious people shamed publicly idiocy. confirm...in Dallas TX, seems several mass vaccination sites switched drive get shot. Basically register, make “appointment” checking in, get shot two minutes later.

City officials seem begging people come out. bad emergency back get plz give shot covid symptoms recently, require restraint. I’m gonna go limb say likely get extended. India doesn’t COVID control ALL, things getting worse day. NHL playing bubble fwiw Michigan 20% fully vaccinated bit 30% one dose. month ago less 10% vaccinated everything opened up, restrictions lifted things, dining, theaters, bars open, schools went fully online 5 days week person heartbeat. Vermonter - Vermont *was* best cases long time, recently seems like younger folks gave patient. Vaccine rollout good could hope largely rural state though, testing, population centers least adults seem believe masks. % population religiously opposed vaccine? live community SoCal large percentage Hassidic Jews opposed getting vaccine. way Israel? Canada big box stores -- still 500 people Costco, long they're buy lawn chairs something. thought Canada safer two countries comes covid protocols... Well, spend lives week, work, natural large part regular social interaction. What's unhealthy enjoying part work? makes day go quicker around makes working less chore really enjoy job (which many don't). know live, lots US colleges universities already partly back campus. virus carried air aerosol, house designed reduce moisture environment, already exist opinion.  People dont use them.... think people start learning flip stove top hood vents bathroom vents guests. Also use strategically opened windows fan placements move surprising amount air. 

You use techniques brand new home least first year anyways ventilate carcinogenic particles released building materials....

If helps cancer causing particles, help pathogens well.. NY opened appointments everyone Tuesday able get shot day. forgetting we've vaccinating people like 4 months, things much better now. 4 months pandemic last year, getting test easy AFAIR, need get upset. Australia started vaccinating people Pfizer? We’ve using months U.S. w/o issue. Baseball season started Chryslers made goat bones. played. N/NE we're already way 4th wave/surge. 

Outside N/NE there's little way ""disturbing case levels"" That’s good know mom recovering Covid now. One shot vaccine would suit fine. Vaccinations per person useless matric one take account doses given. UK jabbed people one dose give widest protection population-wise. Chile stuck normal schedule proportionally less people got vaccine UK. think fair say Oxford Vaccine dead water point. Somewhat disappointing, lot alternatives days. yes, recovered people significant protection reinfection. Studies disagree if, average, vaccines give protection natural infection vice versa. 

One study healthcare workers Public Health England suggested [natural infection gave 90% protection symptomatic disease, compared [86% protection given two doses I'm sure meant Christian evangelical colleges, Catholic universities, generally less ridiculous. Yeah that. I've done office remote switch definitely prefer it.

But I'm saying brand new employee, learn ton entire organization much less time office. personal stuff, off-the-record things like political dynamics leaders *really* talk need XYZ done.

It comes light eventually, whole lot faster passing hall every day. get one jobs? ass working 70 hours week, on-call rotations, like since start pandemic. I'm exhausted. Hospitalizations bad peak Oct/Nov 2020.

This site gives need know (cases, deaths, hospitalizations, vaccinations) easily digestible want details hospitalizations there's Catholics jumped vaccine conspiracy theories way baptists groups have. Even Pope said vaccine okay. Yeah much US better Canada. mostly michigan NY aren't. That'd fair first dose, there's zero studies mixing doses far. rather take untested risk, 1/100K, honestly comparable many everyday risks?

And, again, evidence (no cases reported dose 2) suggested mechanisms suggest dose 2 unlikely cause this. plenty studies COVID19 sub say otherwise. I’m hoping real world application looks better that, it’s worrisome MI right now. Israel somewhat applicable situation vaccinated everyone quickly. is...not happening Michigan. Obviously comment replied anything go by, gormless moron lol end trial data. Like, literally that's 94%... Like, that's literally point data. reason lockdown Michigan point. Vaccination rate fast enough get enough people vaccinated prevent hospitals getting overwhelmed. quite well protected now. Basically immunity 2 weeks first dose, ramps quickly week 2 3 somewhere around 80% think(but quote number).  second dose take 2 weeks bring 90+% mark. considered fully vaccinated. 

But time get second shot pretty good protection already. 94-95% efficacy preventing symptomatic infection, likely around 90% preventing level infection close 100% (realistically probably 97-99%) effective preventing death hospitalization. even bother arguing people No, see im American. Im allowed leave house unlike sub. 

I posted drama ages, digging deep shit clearly see ive got shit going on. youre sub might encouraging basement dwelling. Im never sure #staythefuckhome losers. Michigan keep precautions beginning March, everything basically opened up. People care here. number chin diapers loss respect kind social distancing readily apparent go now. way majority pandemic March.

Schools went hard shut remote 5 days week person heartbeat many districts. kept getting less harassing letters stating kids get back classroom, despite still offering remote option.

Previously PUA federal unemployment, could get unemployment payment work kids schooling home. even get refused unemployment benefits schools offered option get even one day week person. force put kids family risk get paid. dumb. Tech Director. Lots server work, project design, vendor quoting, tier 3 support. That’s stupid argument though better, safer vaccines could place. equally likely die preventative vaccine completely destroys incentive bother it. going ‘take one team’ either. Furthermore risk persists dose 2, would twice likely die virus Usually happens people copy past headline link it. something says exact opposite headline posted. can't right unless Australia two different members giving contradictory information. certainly change narrative Asian society perfect everything right part collective culture whatever BS get written Reddit time. majority UK voters chose brexit/boris, what's point? US country dumb people know haven’t counties done strict air travel general whole time ? Extremely arguably need pay vaccines No-one rule anything second dose vaccine.

I would say people one dose drug problems feel even reassured people dose. shows extent least allergic ingredients (which risk many drugs first time take them). It’s case flights coming Canada India. infected passengers. sooner everyone gets vaccinated achieve herd immunity slow spread mutation faster things get back normal. simple thing. required every single workplace place learning. considered lucky woke middle night feeling like death, fever 101. Nope, AZ cheaper. worried nothing regardless - middle night woke feeling like got hit multiple buses sleep. Fever 101. fun, better COVID. pretty much total bullshit, right? Fauci barely even quoted article, mere days ago [directly stated thinks fourth wave Like sub reddit whole?
I don’t actually use reddit much honest, haven’t bothered learn much joining subs posting words.
I’m curious message could misinterpreted though message clear watched live. 
AstraZeneca recommended 50 Australia, unless otherwise advised doctor understands health history first dose already received.
Changes need made schedule accomodate change recommendation, supply vaccines renegotiated, delays current vaccination phase due change.
It announced 2hrs ago, prior message plans change recommendation.
Are articles saw live press conference? racist Also read population data actual number people currently residing Israel. Rather sum citizens permanent residents.  


The implication citizens moved away Israel (but give citizenship) still counted number. maybe population count overestimation much million people.  complaining thing USA. can't electronically send money individual's bank account via US banking system unless I'm using another service cash broker. makes sense individuals can't direct ACH transfers account bank. thing banks offer wire transfers expensive. point say risk way likely second-dosed people, would've spotted clinical trials, not. assume risk ≈ first dose, suggested mechanisms correct, likely lower. Vietnam

The ""being island"" argument refers ability controlling borders.

Vietnam well, also surrounded countries effectively covid-free. Extremely different average European country, even UK. agree US could done much better job. Um ok Fauci specifically said would take percent people vaccinated, also admitted raising estimates thought could nudge people get vaccine. I.e. ""it unless 80% get vaccinated"" motivate people get it. I'm assuming young. risk ~ equal getting dying covid, assuming low community spread taking vaccine, likely substituting one (incredibly low! Worth emphasising) risk another. Furthermore:

* ever isolate two weeks. _far_ likely outcome either risk, lose plenty things, including important - time.
* (likely) slow community spread, helping country get back normal faster. Israel restricting Palestinians getting vaccine related, it’s human rights issue hope man. US, vaccination efforts running slowly imagine getting vaccinated like q4 year. 2 months in, manufacturing ramped significantly federal government hands on, meaning pretty much everyone wants shot able get one within matter weeks. able get first dose week effort required nowhere near amount effort put get parents appointment months ago latest ""even fully vaccinated, pretend not"" warning. Given know effectiveness vaccines, makes little sense. way shape form related? real religions actual anti-vaccine beliefs? Vaccinations. religious medical reasons get allowed participate online like reporters free step back didn’t like Ted Cruz wearing mask fully vaccinated. I’m tired loopholes put risk. comment stated is, I'm unsure though, likely yes That's absolutely treated office. retrospect absurd knew perfectly capable work home many us **were** work home getting credit ""illicit thing doing.

It ton people making policy older men (in case) felt strongly ""don't believe"" remote work. I'm sorry can't figure work computer without Millennial office help copy/paste, make problem. argument absurd. Thousands turned away hospitals brazil, many ""locked down"" whatever fuck means.

All sudden idiocy others means can't get treatment. almost like, despite braying idiots, live society. means essentially different side effects, blood clots caused contraceptives could mistaken caused vaccines. requires restraint addition vaccines may while. going send 3 million doses Australia production problems commitments.

We know all. AZ stated EU commission asked company request export certification. commission believes Australian situation simply AZ ability fulfil Australian order simply withdraw request. totally within remit show nothing Australia receiving contract EU AZ crystal clear third party obligation reduce supply EU.

This hyperbole, crystal clarity one thing EU/AZ contract absolutely isn't. far aware lawsuit AZ suggesting exports (like 1M doses UK January) actually broke contract. politicians talking. estimates immunity effectiveness one week post second-dose pfizer? got second dose 21 days first dose. think comment revealed possibly got downvoted: easy accidentally think UK equals England. silly mistake make, still. You’re right - I’m Tasmania even safe mainland. 

But QLD locked hard wiped again, we’re good now. Rinse repeat. normal-ish. No. college students, professors, staff vaccinated within next month nevermind fall. Forcing limited class sizes staggered schedules bunch fully vaccinated people plain stupid. reason fall can’t 2019 normal idiotic administrators. Weekly data Germany found here: There's still contingent people remain locked herd immunity. co-worker one – says he's going resume anything close normal life reach 70% vaccinated. I'd imagine types remain. said definitely help definitely advisable current information. think talk testing mix match MRNA vaccines sure like getting every vaccine available, I'm sure someone way smarter explain why. You’re saying mask requirements enforce vaccines I’m saying drop mask requirements enforcement. you’re getting vaccine point you’re ignoring science world hold sake. 

Obviously personally anyone refusing get vaccinated point Excuse me? I'm part cult I'm realistic? creating vaccine hesitancy delaying normalcy. part, still wear masks got two doses Pfizer. 

When fully vaccinated people start dropping dead, judge people like me. Sadly, theres another pandemic, AstraZeneca making non-profit vaccines :( clearly racist.


Wait. What? We’re time? state visited Telengana, time US high point, talked locals said different version “the cases low low published numbers” told 500 sum active cases visited found hard believe **CureVac – mRNA**

**The Unlimited Possibilities mRNA**

As molecule found within forms cellular life, messenger RNA (mRNA) central biology itself. quite literally finds messenger DNA, body’s genetic blueprint, proteins, molecules responsible structure, function regulation body. 

CureVac’s mRNA technology enabled human body produce Lol hope people realize russia came vaccine months USA yet nobody trust lol  did. Diwali November, New Year celebration parties that. pongal January. Plus wedding season usually starts October, depending holy days all. too! hope enjoy normal college year. Wish best friend beauty capitalism, profit lives citizens. mean control? freedoms give up? personally didn’t give freedoms. government doesn’t gain control making wear mask 😂 Yeah good point, definitely due diligence Periodontal disease disease inflammation. frequently presents patients inflammatory issues, like heart disease, obesity, diabetes, auto immune disorders. also appears COVID much risk people inflammatory disease. 

I'm shocked results. issue, however, one show difference correlation causation. Periodontal disease cause heart issues? Periodontal disease result heart disease? one figured out.

Ultimately, people inflammatory issues much likely affected COVID.  also less likely engaged healthy lifestyle. difficult see value study, frustrates medical dental constantly studied two separate fields. mouth part body, yet rarely treated such. got first Moderna shot yesterday afternoon! I'd put name waste prevention list local pharmacies, one gave call - week would've eligible otherwise.

Yeah it’s pretty disheartening see people attribute disparity entirely political shit consider fact socially isolated senior citizen rural area without internet access gonna way harder time getting appointment one living urban area high-speed internet family members help process, regardless either person’s political views affiliation many people blinders regarding stark realities Covid-19. small risk death. Long term effects still 3 Covid survivors diagnosed conditions like anxiety insomnia recovery""

If sane country decent critical thinking skills, people would realize prudent thing vaccinate fast possible keep observing basic precautions months: masks social distancing. Yet we're still seeing people spike ball 30 yard line thinking scored grand slam. (Yes, I'm trolling sportball fans bit) live city 50 000 Finland. local authorities claim ability administer 15 000 doses per week supply there. That's 2 140 doses per day. Extrapolating population Germany would 3 552 400 doses per day. would extremely surprised administer least million per day. Cool realize mandatory schooling  Thanks. sentiments here. ICU nurse (not covid unit) mom.. feeling really blessed little family wasn’t infected, spouse fully vaccinated two weeks. kids ways go, course. husband “covid over, back normal” crowd I’m ready start cautiously getting back normal, keyword cautiously, carefully. But, I’d lying said I’m nervous it. aren’t quite woods IMO. CDC Variant tracker shows breakdown variants state. surprising Michigan highest rate B.1.1.7 country. we? 25 percent natural immunity point. mean yeah know vaccinated thankful realize 100% mandatory Yes, visited things relatively calmed down, state still lying. There’s way I’m believing there’s total 500 confirmed cases state 35 million people. 

This right UK variant believe back nearly month now! Christian Scientists believe oppose forms medicine. grandfather died treatable form bladder cancer belief.

But think hard fast rule, like sin get medical treatment. odds beliefs nature disease healing power prayer. Would interested hear Christian Scientist matter though. Vaccines magically appear factories. numerous materials needed one country sufficient supply self-sufficient. Dubai seen huge surge cases?? getting point Bolsonaro's refusal take covid seriously becoming threat rest world, Brazil. sympathies mom. got J&amp;J Tuesday brutal. brutal covid, way worse effects expecting widespread? mean instead 2 people 60 passing simple general knowledge, math, spelling grammar test try find new apprentices 1 person?

Schools failed us long time occasional student poor household either. talking single country either, wide-spread problem entire school systems stuck 19th century mindsets. shows breakdown state! you’d prefer risk covid vaccine?? studied say help? 

It well could help. talk studying thing. 

Though, yes wait studies concluded encouraging application. Likely written American-designed device using chips manufactured American machinery. device probably shipped cargo ship trade lanes secured American navy.

You’re likely waiting vaccine mostly funded American taxpayers manufactured distributed efficiently America. Statistically, probably live country that’s American nuclear military umbrella. don’t, country likely received American foreign aid. Hate us want, don’t really care, perspective lol.

Also, even attack US here? article NZ. guy knows I’m talking 😎 supposed charge cost price doses? least July. Can't wait Tom Hanks movie flight. Mask mandates reducing rate transmission. rate vaccination high enough keeps rate transmission 1 whole remove restrictions. clear level yet estimates range 55-75 percent. I’d say strive get like 60-70 percent vaccinated completely remove mask mandates large venue restrictions also depends greatly vaccine uptake. hit like 50-60 percent uptake drops drastically rate transmission stays low might point compete remove remaining restrictions like masks large venue restrictions. wish put perspective vs sensationalist headlines. 

What “more young adults” mean?

What death rate someone 30s example? 

1 1000?

All vaccinate quickly hospitalizations continue decline.

I wish news agencies would focus getting past covid staying fear new surges aren’t coming. Yup I’m quarantining really divorcing wife giving covid? Damn That's even close happened though. seeing enormous increase supply. Today tomorrow see even higher numbers. unnecessary, might entirely safe. know studies regarding dosing different vaccines fully vaccinated. extremely safe doses one -- need booster, would get company made original vaccine.

TLDR; Got J&amp;J last night definitely worse covid experience, however neither bad (fortunately) yes, 16-18 priority group. uptake low, though. 44% fully vaccinated recovered. Looking data might sharp uptick vaccinations age group last weeks, perhaps condition going school trips 90% class vaccinated. Lol live places populated fuckwits like US UK, covid rates (all zero them) effected us ages. stand people defend corrupt politicians. apparently people vote I'm curious see happens sub month. Since every state opening everyone right younger people Reddit qualify. means likely first line vaccine. month huge part sub gotten second shot anymore posts ""just got mine"" ""will feel bad"". what's left.... bunch posts variants, keep getting answer over? Two false negatives impossible. millions tests would actually expect decent number double false negatives. would still quarantine regardless feel better. Even flu, still want spread others time.  need 1.6 million per day though. 200k would suffice, maybe even less, combined vaccination centers company doctors (VW large companies start vaccinating employees soon). need get around 715k vaccinations per day May vaccinate whole population end July. heard, increase protection. need one brand. Check [our Vaccine Hopefully answers questions :) mod made also working second part he'll probably post tomorrow! checking site too, says particular Walgreens appointment Moderna Pfizer. sure you’re basing of, tests readily available Florida. able make appointment, drive nearby stadium get free test it’s results one day absolutely are! think AstraZeneca chooses do. becomes clear AstraZeneca intention supplying EU making new excuses every time called out. 

Just clear: nothing UK I’m happy finally ending misery successful vaccination effort. anger purely AstraZeneca. help studied could dangerous. ""**Wittenburg said secret long life? Real potatoes gravy!""**

Stopping store way home work grab bushel taters. new diet starts TODAY Pathological molecular examinations postmortem testis biopsies reveal SARS-CoV-2 infection testis spermatogenesis damage COVID-19 patients “

But go off, king. include workout 8 hours work? made sound like did. locked knees. someone Moderna vaccine shots already, wise go get vaccinated second type like Pfizer, J&amp;J Astra Zeneca? increase protection? people strive get 4 overkill? Can't find guidance this. Thanks. ""Supposed"" who? AFAIK guesstimate government based total quarter deliveries, actual communications J&amp;J.

[According J&amp;J last pay, prolonged problems forming government.  I've hired one person since pandemic began, I'm pretty small employer ten people exactly growth time me. surprised applicants position. caliber applicants very, good though. talking education - everyone 4 year degree days care much anyhow industry - professional, research us coming in, etc. Heard similar things small business owner friends mine. idea medium large companies seeing though.

I think subset people content sit home collecting unemployment long possibly job search market benefits hiring. likely ideal employees hoping anyhow. End left motivated applicants (not confused desperate, case). fair, wedding religious function also festival definition. need bring old fashioned relatives make political debate! Good. Still compatible vaccines. Canes mean get it, working home great.

That said, company requires come back work, is. 

A lot easier say you’re going quit actually it. gonna divorce this? Ok do. asking appointment Friday won’t go That's thing though, kinda agree, opening country adults vaccinated able normal things, kids vaccinated, kids. think mingling, social distancing protocols adults ""follow"" lot harder kids follow. poorer mimicry parents behavior, often. hope collectively okay vaccinated. That's good article - seen that, thanks! looked around seen reported anywhere else, disappointing. 

It's interesting see continuing open operate sites - opened days article written! Based info, definitely surprised see pace expansion lowering favor pharmacies. said, think either/or, blanket strategy involves getting vaccines many places possible. 

In addition, tons mass-vaccination sites directly federally funded hand tons shots. Dodger Stadium LA Javits Center NYC, plenty areas well served big sites. Local governments clearly writing off. 

You'll find disagreement pharmacies important well. goal people get shot way feel comfortable, that's way we're actually going vaccinate enough people. also includes mobile teams drive right rural Americans transportation, probably bunch things. 

It seems bit hyperbolic say mass sites 'disproven' though, one piece bigger strategy. think enough pharmacies NYC vaccinate 8 million people quickly enough. LOL. “Strategy” include Palestinians it? Hint Palestinian part israel, right? got tested Covid twice returned negative times . flu like symptoms like fever, headache cough. still taste smell though Statistically virus can't infect 1.0 people per case, actually significant inflection point. always something fishy someone withholds data blames others withholding. ""Responding letter Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said “purpose self-evident” countries like United States, China, guilty politicising inquiry COVID-19’s origins.


“They insist politicising issue traceability, damaging disrupting China’s cooperation WHO, discrediting China publicly challenging independence scientific conclusions scientists,” said."" problem AstraZeneca knows EU way incompetent force fulfill contracts. take subsidies develop produce EU ship highest bider. Remember 30 millions doses produced plant allegedly able produce 5 million doses per year found Italien authorities. probably tip iceberg. Got mine Westchester County Center believe NYS run site. gave card date second dose also emailed info next day. saw email assumed I'd show day second one. likely certain age groups. full approval 18+. may separate modified EUAs younger children become eligible. Hmmmm... so... AZ able supply countries UK not? EU asked months ago AZ something like this, impossible... I’m panicked UK variant, since vaccines seem provide decent protection it.

The SA variant blowing would different story though. NZ temporarily stops NZ citizens returning india couple weeks interest pandemic safety controls growing concerns Indian cases.

I seen people bring utility bills, passports, non govt IDs, etc. done vaccination. headline saying is.....those things *literally* happened? Even attending large gathering unvaccinated individuals? heard vaccinated ppl still carry virus infect others super-interesting. learned new stuff.

Actually, dose describes mRNA content excludes carrier. Moderna gives 100 micrograms actual mRNA inside lipid nanoparticles.

However, two mRNA sequences identical, they're similar size. Pfizer 4284 base pairs, Moderna 4004. get 93% many molecules amount Moderna vs. Pfizer. 100 mcg dose Moderna equivalent 93 mcg dose Pfizer. Well, certainly proves nations friends, interests.

*to continued* Less effective preventing infection/spread, still appears extremely effective preventing hospitalization death. point we'll probably update weaker vaccines booster shots. Huh? I'm talking court law here, sure trying say. wear mask prevent blasting aerosols mouth nose onto people, hth situation AZ vaccine unclear: simply know blood clotting disorders seen 40 people 55 million vaccinated association cause vaccine. countries suspended use vaccine. think jury still provide much comfort. would take vaccine consider risk COVID greater risk blood clots. change affect mentally?

I swear easier give sleeping pills sugar. Still done it, decreased massively, never really drank soft drinks. fuck tried go cold turkey could last week According card gave me, symptoms last 48 hours call doctor. long list possible symptoms. Congratulations today's stupidest take far. backwards, J&amp;J less effective. came hospitalizations deaths J&amp;J vaccine 100% effective. necessary asymptomatic vaccinated individuals test COVID-19, per CDC. sure someone asked, one friends asked me, person infected original strain COVID twice ?

Edit: dumb explain South Africa rejected certain vaccines performing well variant rich region? 60% adults jab. 100% risk people. 10% 2 doses we've really started anger due strategy increase quickly.

Plus group vaccinated (under 50s) predicted high immunity levels infection herd immunity far away. Cases deaths plummeted anyway Kids risk all. potential risks vaccine would dangerous, vaccinating healthy kids probably what's best imo. know started Wuhan? know AIDS first seen Los Angeles 1981 started Africa 1920? Plateau? seeing spikes. They're really tricky territory. straddle espousing efficacy vaccines individuals society preventing short term major outbreak unvaccinated people going nuts. mention things open disincentivize many people getting it. 0.2 doses per capita plus 0.0096 per day 31 days puts right around 0.5 doses per capita month.

Yes, limit number mutations sustained. coronavirus despite thousands years change still coronavirus. balance mutation fitness, line CoV known. every amino acid RBD changed sure.

CoV-2 fits, we'll see. things low carb, saying. Ive living low carb high fat stuff intentionally past year healthy thin last 20 years. yes, that's even whisky. Seriously - outside preference one dose fine two, otherwise feel like whole vaccine shopping attitude makes sense - either work not, right? Either they're approved effective vaccine covid approved, options basically meaningful way normal person far tell thanks! they? fact outbreak started Wuhan coincidence? Well, don’t seem include death, possibility (an unlikely one, happen) covid. yeah I’d opt vaccine. literally enough MIQ spots everyone wants come home. people literally trying last year simply can't. last minute mentality all.

Thx Thanks advanced ! 

Origin Virus Question:    

Is possible covid-19 virus leaked / escaped / accidentally released / intentionally released lab Wuhan, China (where may studying it/had samples)? similar lab one. side effect due immune system's action, due something nefarious. act though black white. still socialize children safely. Keep mind children going school currently **wearing masks** cases, face shields, well. I'm certain that's great socialization experience, recognize that's parents children decide - me.

Some high schools children go class bring laptop learn along remote children. think children adequately socialized? I'd rather stay home roll bed spend time getting ready, wear mask face shield stuffy classroom I'm looking computer anyways. brain dead. 

At end day, everyone trying best everyone different levels risk willing tolerate. rules, laws, guidance every county country basically different, result, single answer problem... could be.

Stop acting like silver bullet start recognizing problems nuanced solutions, normally never perfect. 

*All ""full-stop"" people need get Dunning-Kruger train.*  Well, yeah, kind exceptions really relevant. reason *want* AZ anyway one get good stuff.

I'm finally getting mine two weeks. There’s stories people dying getting regular blood clots within 30 days vaccine. even bump DVT JNJ trials. stories seem legit make folks nervous. I’ve personal experiences people know. 

Can calm fears normal “it’s safer virus”? Especially low risk virus.

Thank you. ...I somehow missed California variant. That’s true number things:

UK vaccination programme expected grind slowdown April per SAGE: supposed get AZ jabs India longer happening. 

Novavax still massive unknown

We haven’t ordered anymore Pfizer Moderna seem jabs best consistent production

J&amp;J fallen radar

The AZ decision effect vaccine hesitancy see scope may even restrict groups data continues look bad

Our domestic production capacity pretty poor - 2m week really isn’t many grand scheme supply

In short, supply levels mainly staying flat declining, European supply levels growing. aren’t even allowing anyone else make vaccination booking barely enough supply second doses. It’s like story tortoise hare, UK hare leaping resting laurels getting lazy finish line, Europe catch might even overtake certain countries Definitely Democrat states. pandemic reveled collected unemployment last decade due nature seasonal job. year go back work June (farm labor 61) make half much money. Nearly arguments pointless since comes whether precautions followed properly.

Pretty sure indoors, tickets MSG myself. It’s bummer, already several large indoor tours announced fall / winter, here’s hoping guess Yes. People post vaccine tourism time. made year+ without vaccines wait actually useful vaccine, (az basivally useless least one variant you’ll get problem couple months again) also az time till second dose way longer mrna vaccines really quit projecting article say ""More people 55 died AZ vaccine covid Norway""?  part mRNA vaccine programs all-time great, Nobel Prize worthy successes. Russia developing comparable product quickly - skipping around steps able give anyone - inherently suspect. sounds bad lol. Although one issue working feel I'm always work, least even empty office issue. 

But hey everyone's different! I'm people working home. meeting French colleagues hours ago told got vaccinated. 10 told want vaccine, want go holidays. incredulous -- understand thing? large portions society get vaccinated, pandemic end?!?!??

I'm still frustrated it. close billion infections so, that's billion chances mutation, even chance mutation one million. That's still 1 thousand potential new variants. 

Note even count jumping back forth animals humans,.i.e. bats brazil minks europe, Creating even chances mutation. stupid country wants manufacture instead additional biontech factory... take FDA approved one.

I would really surprised don’t let anything year though, barring scenario deadly newly variant shows puts ton vaccinated people ventilators. Look cumulative death count, though.

I guess possible somehow report covid deaths, eh... doubt people particular thread saying year ago going nothing, right summer surge said done, right huge holiday surge said ""nothing worry about"" point public health afterthought US.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Ehh idk much buy this. Mainly schools opened August last year huge jump cases like many people expected. seems school *safe enough* without mass spreading. schools reopening problem would jumped August?

Most read saying sports, including youth league stuff, bigger reason spreading schools open. Nice America mostly vaxxed (by July), exporting good amount 3 million shots per day rest world. That's lot supply lot places. heard Moderna vaccinated fever headache passed day two days most. big deal. Sorry, first time here. Sorry annoy you. great day! thoughts Molnupiravir potential anti-viral treatment SARS-COV-2? seem likely suceed? Oh great, I'm glad hear! prepared completely F'd shot got absolutely nothing. almost excited able call lol. current administration allowed 200K untested, unvaccinated persons southern border last three months. track allowing 1 million year, easily. I'm saying right wrong, pointing fact out. ever achieve full herd immunity? Again, saying right wrong, pointing two sets facts seem mutually exclusive.  anything?

This discussion private educational institution putting requirement student body.

That government mandate. know Florida bellwether bad decision making painter MSM haven’t nearly insane surge that’s continually predicted. Even states theyve continually faired similarly better high lock areas. knows. don’t see worse anywhere else. Yeah, must misread something - purposes information people reading thread, here's CDC page history measles prior 400 people died year measles USA 3-4 million estimated infections year prior vaccine. idea mandating vaccinations school disease killed 500,000 one year US alone would insanity. would surprised Michigan peaks week. rate growth definitely slowing based previous surges Michigan Midwest, month rapidly increasing cases peak, current surge Michigan really started picking March Uggghhh. please ban question? exhausting. Search thread answer. asked every hour. Proportion case counts relevent right? Like we're seeing hospitalizations sum total sure thats good, rate hospitalization age range around indicates probably worse age range probably older people would hospitalized vaccine?

Or talking ass? Flip-floppin' place without common sense.

Also known adjusting guidance based new information data.

See also: scientific method  'Doctors suspect could contagious may resistant existing vaccines….“I suspect existing vaccines slightly less effective preventing infection new variant,” said, “but vaccines extremely effective preventing hospitalizations deaths.”'  Per capita, would US 6200ish deaths day. Way way record high point. case J&amp;J AZ vaccines similar enough seems likely anyone making one switch making quickly. hard part probably getting legal permission.

Now talking switching Az one mRNA vaccines - requires whole new factories supply chains, legal permission comparatively easy. Russia credibility left might meant something. havent sure month, maybe two. correct. OC's claim nothing ""anecdotal"" evidence showing younger adults adults hospitalized severe illness, whether hospitals strained. Yeah, everyone definitely reacts differently sure. effects either COVID one, usually effects Flu Shot either past years F'd - leave work due body aches. Literally time I've ever side effect vaccine. told multiple people 2nd COVID shot awful take day work prepare nothing happened 😐 lol surrounded vaccine skeptics can’t sleep night worried British variant blow through. one piece convincing information give people make day appointment afternoon get first jab. One 72, overweight, diabetes. unwilling risk children's life long health 18-24 months uncomfortability.

If comfort, might agree (honestly, probably even then, given studies likelihood genuinely affecting children). *just comfort*. year (or example, 1.5-2 years) schooling. socializing playing kids. around people living, locked home without much besides stare screen.

Even virtual learning, garbage compared actual classroom around kids in-person learning.

I fully believe putting child's development hold 18-24 months cause MUCH damage would happen Covid exposure overwhelming vast majority kids there. 

And get it... kids major complications. feel bad kids families, people would wreck entire generation children's development kids complications.

My kids in-person learning, going playgrounds, interacting kids often possible, important so. Israel went ONE vaccine. 

It's going one vaccine buy several different ones.

Canada ""way behind"". great actually, except literally handful large countries. way, impossible India. countries those? kids tested positive? We're vaccinated worry little one (she's 2) Development paid Pfizer right? even Pfizer Moderna waited EUA begin ***manufacturing***.

&amp;#x200B;

approved Friday.

in hospitals Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

they cooking vats Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, [authorized Food Drug Friday night emergency use, delivered 145 hospitals, clinics public health systems 50 states Monday morning. Wish best! think FL cases go soon? First day post second dose moderna feel fine. Nothing ibuprofen can't fix Covid vaccines aren’t fully approved, MMR vaccine is. Huge difference first one take. Anyone getting tired people saying “we believe science” saying still need social distance wear masks vaccination. either believe science says work, deny science work (and effect anti-science).

There waffling middle like bunch people doing. Hi Dr. Racaniello!

If understand correctly, mRNA vaccines behave little like Covid itself, use mRNA directly without going step. Could explain apparent efficacy advantage?

Many thanks rest TWiV team do. previous article quoted saying virus would radically change evade vaccine protection time media seems concerned B.1.17 B.1.526. explain fears warranted variants pose much threat fully vaccinated individual? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fold napkins watch challenge ass couch 😂 wouldn’t call 6% positivity rate “surging”. It’s ideal, it’s also state (if most) relaxed measures US. fact isn’t worse seems pretty encouraging. many people don’t want vaccine? come people don’t want vaccine people don’t follow guidelines causing spread?

I get scared vaccine, everyone followed guidelines, would need vaccine (at least moment). AZ clots time period appearance 4 16 days. odds extremely low unlikely cause headache. 

Symptoms include new onset severe persistent headache blurred vision, shortness breath, chest pain, leg swelling, persistent abdominal pain, unusual skin bruising, pin-point spots beyond injection site. day got shot went home slept 15 hours, felt like run marathon. 2 days later still lethargic arm felt like Mike Tyson hit power. week later symptoms feel great, next shot 4/20! mean, still can't say ""get vaccinated, encourage around get vaccinated go back normal."" laughable point Air vaccinated healthy, safely visit country low rate vaccinations? stronger side effects first Pfizer, notice second. Hey that's great! thanks sharing. Uruguay population vaccinated Sinovac. got first shot week ago. 

This information really helpful :)  Cute?

Your misplaced bravado embarrassing. Maybe get house order start bragging exports, cause compared UK USA vaccination progression ""cute"".  far aware, US completely destroyed infrastructure general practitioners, Germany, vital functioning system brings medical service even smallest communities.

Whether quality care another story. GPs Germany part solo practitioners working country without board certification enforced continuing medical education. Evidenced-based medicine wholly foreign concept. Add demi-God status granted culture disdain explanation beyond, ""trust I'm doctor"" start understand many people Germany driven seek care quack homeopaths natural ""practitioners"". 

I can't wait hear many first doses given family, friends, golf partners. went vaccination 10:30 saw ambulance come waiting 15 mins parking lot. gonna lie seeing news story later day freaked completely normal side effects. So, millions mostly old people vaccinated therefore far less likely end hospital... means young people catching going make larger *portion* hospitalizations now. Makes sense. Young people still far, *far* less likely end severe case die old people, though. We’re miles ahead 2020 based vaccinations. 

The goal isn’t “no one ever get sick”. long there’s hospital space need it, that’s key. Covid isn’t going anywhere. wash groceries such?

I've read worry much catching virus via touch, OTOH we're still told wash hands. same, holy shit that's high percentage. metro Nashville case counts low though, perhaps high initial rate infection 1+ 3 vaccinated county. US, given vaccinations accelerating, when(month?) think responsible vaccinated person stop wearing mask public? Meanwhile New York Rangers cancelled practice yesterday players staff could time get vaccinated. never taught thankfully never will, know field seen member US soon EU I’m proud both. EU fumbled beginning countries didn’t. received second shot US minutes ago. think majority happy getting much vaccine there. rollout highly politicized. Florida pop vaccination sites appeared white affluent communities access limited specifically certain zip codes. 

I find ironic groups constantly downplayed danger virus making sure get vaccine first. 

Still. 42% adults gotten least one shot 25% fully vaccinated.  Soon access won’t matter.  open appointments waiting people show get shot. would guess 4 6 weeks hit point. Genuine question, said France’s decisions “insane”? remember saying evidence UK yet, wasn’t conclusion regarding B117 virus? infectious infecting younger people? Going 2nd Pfizer today! Can’t wait buy Microsoft stocks! Lol /s No, EU dropped ball negotiating long price, countries signed contracts. EU faces dilemma one making. said still hypothetical study. research needed three sessions therapy need. need therapy CCP pay post, fixed weekly stipend? really doubt it. gain footing vaccination hospitalizations/deaths start decrease, kind suspect need delicious tourist dollars expedite process returning normal. best vaccine take, consider

Duration vaccine.

Ability deal variants.

Safety

### ? Maybe basic question, everyday read many millions vaccinated. point expect translate decrease cases? think COVID-19 eventually become seasonal thing like flu people get it, feel bad, part recover longer term issues? so, see becoming inconvenience versus serious health threat? really wanting define young adults vaccinate quickly hospitalizations continue decline.

Well, no, lots things **can** slow spread. point? political them? wish news agencies would focus getting past covid staying fear new surges aren’t coming.

I agree. Articles employers incentivize workers get COVID vaccines. article Hollywood show-runners working health professionals write COVID vaccinations scripts order combat vaccine hesitancy. article kids playdates still can't get COVID shot. would good things news agency like CNBC could write about.  Lol gender sex, intrinsic point time required campus (the fall semester) approved EUA argument matter anymore.

In fact, I'm aware *anywhere* currently required US. far know hospitals requiring employees get yet. Same, bought ""burn out"" theory going around It’s weird people keep saying “we believe science” keep denying science comes requiring masks/social distancing post vaccine.

You either believe science, don’t. You’re talking long term health effects. 

They often completely ignore long term effects shutting schools removing social interaction children, too. question come past: person who’s vaccinated still transmit virus others? remember reading lot Michael Levitt's work Pandemic started, sadly wrong quite bit definitely provided positivity dark time Ah yes, remember “death week”. death week turned death month, turned death summer, turned never ending timeline death got used to.

At least we’re real end vaccines. countries pursuing strategy immunizing many people possible first shot 2-dose regimen instead making sure fewer people get doses (due vaccine shortage). 

How concerned approach leading suboptimal immune response may lead selection antibody-escape virus variants individuals getting infected SARS-2 full vaccine protection accomplished.? Hello doctor, thanks well constant work.

I don’t normally AMAs curious thoughts regards vaccine production future. 

This pandemic really highlighted world short period time able get vaccines world. However, long term testing taken place don’t know may long term side effects. 

While I’ve vaccinated don’t concerns side effects, many people do. think rapid vaccine releases future, believe release many vaccines emergency approval inside year one-off pandemic? Offices going maintained periodic client meetings.  They’re good anything else. little known phenomenon taking place courts.  Judges realizing conduct everything including jury trials ZOOM.  Lawyers realize argue motions pjs ifthey want 90 % appearances telephonic.  Even appellate level judges order case resolved papers without oral argument.  Everybody agrees personal appearances easily handled remotely unless you’re shortstop MLB team.  can’t believe Homo sapien look like 500 years.  Probably ability retain choice narrative corpus worry except one created electronically.  course unlike Westworld can’t know that’s happening advance carnival game.  must Matrix, smart guy, even though I’m sure there’s holes theory.  consciousness entrapped inside vessel either young old productive leaving burden production 25-64 crowd.  noise dropped off.  

Today millennials going fine, sure problem is.  boomer exits steadily increased rate job created steadily increased rate.   That’s politics economics talking, that’s common sense.  business owner exits thing.  labor shortage highly educated sophisticated workers owners going care major Poetry.  There’s lot fewer boomers means larger share pie inheritance you’ll get.  Support infrastructure, it’s subsidy millennials grab it. You’re heiress heir.  Think like that.  Trust me, Florida worth warm weather, plus heat suffering summer. second Moderna yesterday. 14 hours shot, hit insane chills. shaking much teeth chattering. insane.

I've spent today state exhaustion terrible headache. Turns inactivated vaccine doesn’t produce much antibodies N-protein thought. produces neutralizing antibodies S-protein, though, like adenovirus mRNA vaccines... 

That said, right antibody test now, came positive. Gonna every month, monitor situation. work Silicon Valley job full perks happy employees (mostly)

I miss social literally hundreds people time, various degrees subcutaneous upward. I’m crazy extrovert wrecked pandemic Yeah, kids one big. people hear complaining almost ubiquitously kids, kids also schooling home. really unfair-- usual corporate workplace seems driven people chose kids. Actually whole immigration thing stopping him. Canada much easier rest TN visas, still need get actual job offer valid TN visa move. sure start lol.

I feeling job(s) talking belong unions possibly really old unions around long time. Also, would guess husband works small company owners/management actually interact employees. said, everyone US treated way. manual labor jobs treat employees poorly well. limited office jobs. lot anti union tactics companies use continue violating workers rights legally. that, employers want people qualified pay less. usually means less benefits, less perks, less personal interaction, employer consistently short staffing cut costs. work force now. Even someone works manual labor not. I'm sure Redditor's speak experience.

Your husband REALLY nice job short. Make sure holds typically jobs/employers like anymore &amp; bother keep raising wages accommodate rising cost living expenses. chances getting blood clot astronomically small, it’s understandable want play safe Step 1: Take selfie it
Step 2: Put someplace safe case need later good strategy. Nobody remembers pessimistic predictions turned wrong, opposite enough destroy credibilities. world wide occurrence right now, hope good news Meanwhile, would rather die sit front fucking computer day again. school went back hybrid, GREAT see actual human children, even faces half covered! Part what's bullshit. much magical number 8 hours actually anything. i'm getting at. think back worked scool campus something. might specific set things whatever time. doubt, something magical telling people ooh 8 hours productive rather specific tasks do. otherwise practically killing people. Setting say ok however many groups 5 huge things, example want done reasonably well, done, go home play WoW, Pubg lounge pool staring pretty girls. I'd guruntee, kind work place people would go: oh. ok look 10 things, take notes person, start specific plan next 6 weeks? that's it? uh ok awesome. also guruntee you, without fail, someone stock holders middle managers go hurdur uhuhuhuhu ur uh 99 things uuuhuhuhuh 8 hour day uhuhuhu pay 20 hour uhuhuhuhuhuerhuher auh!

I Likely type person loves WFH actually anything  difficulty determining causal link. CVST rare low incidence. reports crop side effects, going immediately jump conclusion two linked. half adult population vaccinated, reports magnitude events would otherwise happen even absense vaccinations. example, every day cases appendicitis almost certainty number cases would recently vaccinated; report this? Unlikely, least numbers significant enough make think may link (eg numbers exceed incidence timing coincidental). thing vaccination programme ramped significantly recently - many daily vaccinations carried January/February especially true AZ vaccine, cases innevitably crop up. Furthermore, there's point awareness look for; CVST became highlighted, probable reporting symptoms 'headache' taken little seriously undergoing imaging identify thrombosis instead listed 'headache'. Continuing on, cases may identified retrospectively. well asking patients return investigations, patients may also undergone postmortems take time.

What I'm trying say jumped quickly conclusion yet several explanations happened; probably best jump conspiracy theories 'the government lying' 'the government covering up' since that's misinformation spreads, especially complete lack evidence.  think issue almost outdoor gathering implies very-much-indoor-restrooms.

Oh, gathering limit matter much restroom shared across dozens small gatherings. You’re making unemployment worked? Unemployment pays sh*t still better worked? Wow! That’s really sad. Maybe working try go school earn credential sort may give access job pays better unemployment. Don’t waste two years. curious, specific reason Native Americans allocated lot doses faster states? shit. civil? What's grudge people work remotely? Oh yeah. Mine totally topic chatter. talk bars, weekend activities, family, sex, flirt, joke...whatever. lot job waiting stuff gets set another team. wait, chat dick around. 

That’s don’t go home every day work hating life. It’s almost like complete change livelihood social isolation lead increase mental health issues. would’ve thought People want better lives. news Water wet. happens specific group told cannot work, cannot enter places business, cannot utilize mass transit, cannot travel state borders enter city limits?

You suggesting person chooses purposely exclude (by deliberately remaining health risk people around them) bearing consequences decision, equivalent person excluded things color skin different ruling class country?  lessons past learned workers’ blood. People worried, really taken meaningful steps alter behavior. hear lot people saying ""Wow, new wave COVID really scary, huh..."" eating, drinking smoking friends pubs. NYC. Well, r could less 1 reasons herd immunity, like effective lockdown. That’s reopenings often result r going back 1 creating new surges. realize everyone hates tankies, right?  reply would 2 weeks notice. Fuck guy 62 cases many millions AZ shots administered? think I'll fine. quit job spot once. already another lined chose give half day notice instead, right lunch Friday last day.  Interesting link. Thanks. Ontario locking month, would rank 20th States behind every state that’s pretty much open restrictions? Canadians talking good shit back 2020.

Just hope parents stay safe. True. feel like deserve ability work remotely. upper management does. deserve it, still perform. issue here, thinks honestly beneficial livelihood without negatively impacting jobs responsibilities. I'm fucking shaking right lol There’s expiration date immunity gain covid. It’s probably four six months. Throw like Pokémon card I’m trying get dodger game one dying back person absolutely need social interaction function lol awesome! hindsight, could’ve done insanely strict New Zealand style lockdown

What happens next pandemic? people agreement get quickly strict lockdowns? Yeah, Texas Georgia's big surges last year started increasing June peaked July. know much ""seasonality"" effects virus one data point make pattern, definitely difference 2020. I've looking remote work years never could find good remote job. I'm glad shown companies beneficial remote work be. OP, quick glance Michigan data shows cases reached time high levels (92% time 7-week daily average), deaths still 23% time high. Maybe deaths shoot up, it’s showing right now. I’m expert, thought herd immunity actually nearly instantaneous change. r 1, aren’t there. r crosses r&lt; 1, you’re there. Maybe, guess point would describe job “sit work day”. think slope slippery. would surprised grocery stores required something like this. even did, long think grocery stores want pay someone stand front ask vaccine verification?

Also, ""can"" ""should"". putting people risk traveling without vaccine. places move open office plans harder harder get anything done. many distractions. I've easily doubled productivity working home. started interact spam phone callers small talk them. union. Unions amazing things great ensuring fair pay floor. also definitely hamper ability get ahead everything done seniority. fuck vaccines think cause number people move lower COL areas. I’m sure real estate investors already pondering WFH people move next years. Or, maybe abroad?  dies, done great service. goes ways, mutations/recombinants make virus worse even better. Regardless, see every vaccine going come updated shots/boosters. one genocidal poor people? sure looks like anyone outside Brazil. read article patient adverse reaction first dose given second dose small increments pauses thus adverse reaction. also test later see sufficient antibodies. job? concerns many governmental entities enforcing mask mandates without stated endgame. hear “not yet”. Many businesses following along - “not yet”. I'm office politics dropped least 90%, people afraid bother eachother IM/Zoom whenever instead requiring meeting invite month advance, people working roughly hours, nobody died driving work year exhausted, everyone roughly 30 minutes 3 hours time 5 days week whatever want (nobody chooses sit gridlock. )


You selfish motherf**ers wanting come in. decades old - get chance something different people make going suck bad can't live want us RTTO. got covid immunity naturally last June kept D3 levels high throughout early supplementation. minimal disease. Vaccines without risk especially ones authorized memegency use. example, run risk ERD vaccine. protein mrna vaccines targets evaded new wild variants next fall antibodies become non neutralizing. adhere virus without impeding cell infiltration neutralizing virus form coagulants cause death lungs alveoli. ERD intentionally engineered targeting protein vaccine manufacturers cannot guarantee ERD occur. They've stated explicitly multiple articles. permitted emergency authorization use. long term safety data exists. order risk realized neutralizing antibodies need become binding antibodies neutralize virus. Interestingly giving vaccine pandemic maximize likelihood vaccine escape creating trillions replication events evolutionary pressure modify spike protein. already occurred south Africa variant. 10x harder neutralize. real risk SARS vaccines mouse studies published nature showed lung tissue severely damaged vaccinated cohort upon challenge wild variant. happen? Impossible know. experiment. think that's bad vaccine administered mean pandemic ever over. socialite friends first die, disease course shown. Flee. Flee far.

Getting internship...I can't remember Apple\[as iOS\] iomega. No..it Apple!I think had-----3 physical meatings 2 years intern. Seriusly best job ever. Uh almost boss boss asshat lol hence 3 person meetings. sufficed say. till much latter places like yahoo, altivista blah blah started whine productivity, making much metric mattered. god bullshit. find busy work get laidoff. 3 hours per day

x 

5 days per week 

x 

52 weeks per year

740 hours 32.5 days train get work. 

In normal year would spent mother’s day train. work 3 days week side work(electrician) ended getting job offer making $6-8k year more. apartment complex charges like 5% online payments, use check. I'm already paying rent let alone fee pay said rent sure thanks too! part it’s much healthier freaking true.... I’m Texas. know several cases teenagers week -very sudden. I’m curious see coming weeks show cases here. choice 30 60 hours definitely 30. Especially hard salary pay same. 

But option stretching 40 hours 50 week socializing, that's extra 30k year pocket. easily go 7 instead 9 still get home time. 

You bet ass would take getting paid bullshit. firmly believe closing schools year going viewed biggest regret response. butterfly effects going way worse lives saved. remaining 66% can't afford quit. Oh yeah. Long term, absolutely see evening everything. Salaries, housing, etc.. short term, employees already around think could work. thread hilarious. idea play 2 years now. thing know people tend view world blinders, many shrink view even further. works longer term determined. idea. entertaining listen people twist knots.

""I'm hardest working person planet losers would leave alone.""

Oh..my cheeks hurt laughing. got turned interview 2018. asked hiring manager later feedback declined. answer everyone really liked thought would good fit, asked telecommuting options felt showed wasn’t committed job. asked, demanded. said, “so departments policies preferences remote working?”...that’s it...Lol. glad didn’t get job. Israel still closed international travel, fully open. variants get really talk herd immunity. could make hat, brooch, pterodactyl do, it’s questionnaire get vaccinated CVS. Looks like reporting dump deaths. Come guy think?. Israel basically ethnostate long list human rights abuse apathetic population I’m referring you, honey  Herd immunity never achieved without vaccination

spanish flu? True, office job worth commute goes along it. Come guy think?. Israel basically ethnostate long list human rights abuse apathetic population Kings fan here, may leg stand on, you’re standing us. We’re prosthetic. Lol. UK apparently days away achieving herd immunity due high vaccine rate confirmed infections. say near 75% population antibodies protect Covid-19. Oh. Palestine? fake news Vaccine still effective problem Last thing read EMA still waiting full stage 3 trail date sure would lie that. Think process relatively transparent EMA works. Gamaleya pretty cagey trail data beginning. mean approved Russia stage 3 even done. imagine might problems putting together way stands international scrutiny least regards ethics. get wrong, know seems decent vaccine. I'd prefer Biontech one take whatever offer turn. No, count deaths differently Nordic countries. include died example heart disease already Corona. people get death count. matter died covid died reasons. That’s herd immunity means things would necessary without government. getting from? Ofc American citizans excluded, looks like complete  can't blame people government care. enough time run vaccination program. Indian Government bungled thoroughly. playing politics distribution vaccinations well. already third wave third lockdown  Palestinians Israeli residents - 20% Israeli population - get access vaccines like everyone else. Palestinians live WB Gaza separate government, part Israeli population, wish annexed it. 100k vaccinated Israel (those work Israel proper), far they've received several additional tens thousands doses sources. would love 2 days home office monday friday. Monday woulndt waste time day usually tired anyways. friday get faster weekend.

Right shower evening wake 5 minutes work starts. fact productive office. Wow douchebag thing say. think anyone deserves contract covid Mostly Pfizer Thank much!! far know IOC said can't. dont year happen.

If Japanese I'd inclined say ""well happen then"" Ok, mate. predict open terraces soon without regard numbers are, certainly business-oriented populace-pleasing policy. /s think we’re really reaching inflection point vaccine availability/demand city. city extremely “blue” it’s hard get appointment TONS open today. 

But it’s Thursday, know locations are, sign one.

I know follow local news accounts pay lot attention stuff. think we’ve reached point people time, (can get work) resources, motivation knowledge gotten appointment shot. 

Now figure get people can’t get work, childcare obligations, poor internet/information access, aren’t great English. yeah, folks want vaccine kind lazy needs really convenient them. 30% country already done, throw another 50% vacinated ready move on, vacinated next two months. 20% want remain lock forever (this group 50% reddit)

I fully vacinated ready move on. keep mask summer vaccination done, time move on. Almost one claiming herd immunity possible. real debate whether could happen without vaccines. conveniently forgetting (in addition everything birdgovorun said), Egypt also controls gets Gaza. hear complaining them... I've got healthy friend who's currently ICU P1 variant. He's 28 Yes, confirmed positive safe together, according John Hopkins university FAQ.

Anyway it’s back 80k vaccinations per day (after Easter drop off) half million week on. couple weeks it’ll well way. going post literally everything mentions Palestine? Moderna recently state ""up to"" 6 months. language used ""at least"" 6 months.

The vaccine probably confers immunity longer 6 months, simply around long enough definitively say so. think answered question, produce enough is.

So hurry get approved. Maybe get food somewhere else needs attack post history knows telling truth

I've seen type behavior countless times many swedes here...

This method used keep people within ""åsiktskorridoren"" (opinion corridor) Sweden maybe? 5% WB Palestinian population lives Area C, 60%. conflating territory population. say nothing elephant room almost people affected blood clots women. family due receive 2nd dose next week. 8 weeks since 1st. They're still getting I'm thinking delaying bit more. far know use data used Hungary license vaccine. producers Sputnik V using apply European Union right now. someone either side us dragging feet. Yeah, except needing work make living, needing use public transport go work, needing go hospital, etc. definitely says ""up 6 months"" newspaper here. Can't look original press release check says tho completely dominant now. might change high rate vaccinated people. anyone (state, country, etc.) breaking current cases vaccinated vs. unvaccinated? seems data available highly suggestive overall vaccine effectiveness effectiveness versus variants. anyone seen reported anywhere?

(I asked late day yesterday, I'm asking try get info folks. link provided yesterday, exactly type thing I'm looking for: ) Thanks Israel effectively transitional government 2 years since every election clear winner one get majority form government. 

Technically speaking government opposing blocs corona started emergency government, quickly fell apart coronavirus dealt with. contradict him? 58% vaccinated 15% natural immune. That’s 73% immunity. aren’t sure long natural immunity last someone said Israel vaccinating people sick. Dude. woke don’t know happened. Like. People mad post why? literally live military base. They’ve told us it’s mandatory service members. I’m currently full time college student. president university emailed us students telling us encourages everyone get vaccinated can, it’s mandatory. sources. base university. fucks sake. ""up to"", ""at least"". Prior estimates Moderna 8+ years.  What's obsession doubling stupid?

A knife gun weapons. thrombosis leg brain blood clots. make equally dangerous, it? six months problematic. Means re-vaccinate new wave. mind getting shots vaccine production issues massive. wonder getting vaccinated getting mild case covid-19, might offer lasting protection? First: refers AZ. 

Second: knpow EU block AZ export (with exception COVAX) AZ catches up. official position, month old news.  also potential cure Type 2 diabetes using mRNA. Vermonter here. really well last winter summer, last weeks cases per capita one highest US.

Seems like vaccine rollout going well through. strong support republican governor expect fewer anti-vaxers places. It’s SII (Serum institute India), SSI. get past editing? Reuters really? hate comparison, comparison risks. quantifiable benefits risks many activities, risks outweigh benefits, shouldn’t it, don’t, crack on. 

Birth control pill benefit stopping pregnancy risk blood clot. like balance crack on, nothing vaccine. 
The vaccine benefit protecting loved ones virus, risk blood clot. like balance crack on. 

The reality moment risk young people family low virus much less prevalent say January. offered polio vaccine one million chance killing wouldn’t take it, polio. yellow fever going somewhere yellow fever would.

The point it’s really complex simple comparisons make either side seem like they’re ignorant brainwashed anti science anti freedom simplistic. scared vaccine, go school. one mentioned driving longer answer is, \~30% population 16 years old 

that's buttload hasidic children. floored jewish coworker told wedding 400 people small one, trouble finding venues accept norm 700+ people Modi might incompetent Trump. self righteous sense entitlement Americans always funny see. US ditched production AstraZeneca - it’s better produce approved vaccines know work vaccines possibly approved. 

Both JJ Sputnik adenovirus based vector vaccines, resource use pretty similar. Brazilian variant. Highly transmissible severe version covid. believer buddy got hospitalized. He's healthy 27 year old Meanwhile, Mongolia population 3 million people recently 800 cases. prime minister announced 5th 6th lockdown since start pandemic. fuck sake. really read article posting.. Duh!! many teams league? amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  guess I’m arrogant then. I’m going deny online learning challenge, lot resources make engaging. 

Sure it’s boring expect students log take notes teacher goes PowerPoint, doesn’t way.  both? big part US's success vaccination basically threw dollars every vaccine candidate came way. manufacturing CLS fair recall. Everything else need imported. Happy days 😃 954 deaths??? that's huge number vaccine coronavirus never developed before, highlights much success science.
Apparently proper funding goes long way. Allowing? choice? Lmao didn't. forget studies going trying figure many women taken vaccine gotten worse periods (more blood flow, longer periods heavier cramps). I'm vaccines, early 30s, living Germany reading every week feel - kind become someone stressed getting first! occupation troops want get priority locals ? this, though would appropriate requirements diseases fully approved vaccines temporary/emergency use. 

If someone says ""I'll take winter fully approved"" hard time arguing it. see able ban person plane stadium summer, harder see resonably e.g. ban something effectively makes taking not-quite-fully-approved vaccine pseudo-mandatory. Higher education (it's mandatory), close. 

There simple solution dilemma that's giving final (non-emergency) approval least one vaccines. already happpened many countries, see US would lag much longer that. country able ban citizens returning home. India allow stay? do? chose unreasonable option IMO

Honestly, Telling *If able produce enough deliver according contract signed, exporting, especially countries getting dose per capita* seems unreasonable. 

Indeed EU fucked-up negotiating *vague 'best effort' contracts* AZ promising one issues mess Chile, too. Higher number vaccinations per person UK, example, second wave cases (and much worse first).

Unfortunately, don’t think vaccines get jail card yet. need mix vaccines policies get side pandemic. also add recovered covid patients 2.5 million doses though Many people think virus end. truth humans currently know enough viruses confidently say one way other. better safer vaccines available though, case switching pfizer instantly available since obviously massive shortage moment. choice lot countries az wait risk catching covid meantime. young, better wait, old, better get az well, noticeable. Europe needs figure produce vaccines. way behind curve. imagine fair amount people go way get shot get one $10 giftcard CVS refuse one doctor asked get one there. least, that's tends go annual flu shots.

We probably two weeks mass vaccination sites operating state. understand, they're primarily giving 2nd doses people chomping bit get first shots last month. There's trickle walk-ins getting shot #1 right now. education social development entire generation going permanently damaged measures taken.

I dread think ramifications enter adulthood wider population. mean, like, totally dude... mean like... yeah... like... agree!  necessarily. Regardless, different country?

And “pre-infectious?” Aren’t “pre-infectious?” know variant dominating india right now? Ohhh makes sense!!Thanks clearing up!! 'made up'. educated guess meant taken literally. Like say fossil 6.5 million years old. Two years later 6,500,002. forget literally waging national campaign pay people travel domestically. routinely testing 16k-60k people per day. Japan fucking joke reason people say otherwise they're obsessed country (or more, anime/nature pics coming country) want Olympics go on. distributed plant issues. screen people active covid infections. ~10 days passed good.  think really funny people comment section want go back office like ""sure I'd ok hybrid model, prefer working office think everyone want to"" whereas people want continued remote work often like ""I walked 10 miles ways snow storm commute every day coworkers would spit food boss verbally abused spent 800 dollars commuting can't fathom anyone would want go back think offices close"". experience universal people do, fact, succeed different environments. social life home life great, millennial, also ADHD WFH incredibly difficult me. Especially realise high level infected population means lot new variants brewing, freak virus emerging there, uncanny testing evasion, immunity current vaccines, increased lethality available doorstep next week, courtesy globalized economy. Previous trials similar vaccines took two years show severe/fatal adverse reactions. would CCP gives 50 cents.. sadly get paid like you. don't.

Molson Coors running separate promotion. 

The headline confusing since clear article list various promotions. can’t person finds concerning?

I’m vaccines, also don’t see point getting shot since I’m group that’s least risk anything severe COVID.

It also seems like it’s hard get anything 100% confirmed.

So far, understanding vaccine mainly reduces symptoms necessarily stop infection/spread.

Also would expect everyone around vaccinated I’m not, I’m risk people?

Please feel free correct anything I’ve misunderstood. extended Apr 18 routinely perform anywhere 16k-60k tests per day country 127 million. days test less states Arkansas Wisconsin do, populations &lt; 9 million. case? Every time tried get appointment asked I’d covid symptoms recently. said yes would still get it? assumed screening got text doctors office get vaccine now. second shot tomorrow don’t need it, good see another expansion availability Same, know truly nightclub without mask on. Rapid antigen test allowed rule, 50% accuracy infection severe, basically coin toss virus 60 90 day shelf life, lock cut contact totally kill off. almost made fucked up

Most car crashes happen 5 minutes home.

Struggling Canada right too. province couple months everyone first shot, we're lockdown things worse entire last year :( understanding estimate number people willing come in. Even thread, lot time it’s similar proportion 25-50-25 variations. calculate expect, say, 30% employees given time, create space them. permanent, others - hot desks advance booking. Hotels restaurants it, office-based businesses too) Thank you! imply produce better protective immune response?
Sorry that’s dumb question, parents got Moderna wife sister got Pfizer. No, didn’t ask. One coworkers did, told - don’t want anyone working home. since quit didn’t get severance. will. btw covid means partly vaccinated anyway vaccines using there? mostly AZ? guess comparing AstraZeneca. Problem AstraZeneca European counties received little communication expected doses - sometimes deliveries cut half week, countries informed boxes thousands doses less promised week. 

While regretful J&amp;J reducing deliveries April, giving sufficient notice planning deliver committed Q2. travel non NZ citizens permanent residents banned anyway? described sounds like absolute nightmare half country. huge percentage population would never go something like that. 

And learned already. Biden switched plan utilizing mass sites one utilizing local clinics private sector. stated reason people use mass sites areas. 

I fell like post basically already disproven. literally restraint discipline israel, israeli tell nobody uses mask lot gathering. Thats bad situation vaccines believe herd immunity implies disease able spread basically go away. Sounds similar Trump? believing said speed going pick significantly: would love rub big fat ""I told so"" face ;) Yes I’m aware. numbers come continue vaccinate. help wife who's ""convinced got covid last March"" (no positive test) thus need vaccine..

She's anti vac general likely excuse anyway. comments South Korea? government given stimulus? friends Canada whether worked they've received stimulus generously that. Cases seen plummeting vast majority Western world.

This simply untrue time receive second (different) shot, first shot long cleared system. side effects (besides known effect whatever vaccine receive). Cross-Reaction vaccines given months apart something usually investigated all. question whether efficacy high would two doses vaccine.  israeli confirm eligible get vaccinated mean drug, cool drug (developed fast, miracle modern medicine) *cool* drug. heard education portion year lost regained huge deal yr socialization psychological development structured environment huge problem. Since part system true. teachers feel next year able move kids next grade? crippled entire classes students? Since many students anecdotal information learning well like used to? 80,000 samples taken live animals around markets around farms China, one single sample linked outbreak. research done. clear theories strongly considered, zoonotic theory seems bleaker bleaker. J&amp;J, Moderna, Pfizer use stabilized/prefusion spike protein. vaccines (AZ) don't. terms covid bad. terms everything else, bad Pretty dark vaccinating West Bank Palestinians concurrently murdering them. work sales, ya. I'm mainly referring back office ppl. Get know office, good work, get promoted. makes really great time reopen schools, day care centers, indoor dining! Let's get going! that's reading headline differently (Yeah read article first). choices literally head ""you're going back work fired."" yeah, option find new job working home go back in, could see lot people that. want lose seniority I'm 10 years 1 2 years real vacation time kicked in, totally. Hmm... says distributed, can't reason side effects? that's lot vaccines go waste! real, Winter really bother I'd wearing scarf anyway, thought another Summer wearing mask 90F weather bums Yeah wait 30-40 mins allow goverment dictate can’t do? Saarland model region opened almost everything test option since Tuesday. Damn, OK break &lt; 1k deaths streak. actually changes anything would've nice Yeah probably need way less 75% population isnt vaccinated mostly children, arent high risk covid anyway Real world results suggesting differences vaccines seen trials may due different reporting standards. 

 Norway figures concerning need investigation still dealing small numbers therefore get clusters longer time period would show movement back levels seen elsewhere. may find difference populations respond. 

Point people pausing group risk less value, doesnt mean good vaccine younger age group still lower risk getting covid. vaccines available would still better get it, alternative luxury waiting. require get tested board flights goint US (I've done it).

Requiring vaccinations complicates rn vaccine really available countries. tons people traveling US get vaccinated rn though. description could fit mass sites FEMA set bunch major cities. coordinate local/state governments enough get other's way, hood logistics administration federal employees military personnel rolling in, kicking ass taking names extra vaccine whatever allocated local efforts mind everyone opportunity get vaccinated, need return normal. know might ethical answer people ALSO suffering lock downs restrictions. Normal needs return. What's story Denver site administering J&amp;J shut yesterday? 13 people 1700 reaction site day. Stop blaming everything people rural Michigan Whitmer forced Gordon replaced Republican, could sell us restaurant lobby. CDC ground saying need restrictions, yet still refuses. we’re great set motion. Says expert 😁 Probably mocking sarcastic version “just two weeks flatten curve!” Also, variant Brazil probably main thing wreaking havoc. Yeah, exactly point? J+J rather similar Oxford, requires one shot isn’t stained controversy. It’s objectively better option point. AU switching J&amp;J sign come. 20k daily cases look steep increase daily cases worldometer. Brazil seems affect whole region there.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  think people ""open up"" camp feel ""open up"" vaccinated folks. one thinks unvaccinated people acting pandemic wise. No, happening Brazil much ""good"" Well, yeah almost everyone already vaccinated. gotta remember 0-16 year olds still cant get vaccinated theres always percent anti-vaxxers. Also, gotta wait 3 weeks doses long even talking about?? sound completely unhinged. Canada covid deaths per million = 609

US covid deaths per million = mean, many universities already said they're requiring masks. Many people think they'll backtrack fall semester gets closer, I'll believe see it. mind. think reason there's fairly big contingent anti-AZ people subreddit. 

Luckily seem translated adversely affecting UK uptake, Reddit downvotes bother slightest. 62 million doses Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine need checked contamination may need thrown Judging hair you’re arguing feminist sure even count recovered cases? like someone tested positive weeks later tested negative? never get tested second time never get counted? ”You get obey”.

Objectively, find terrible slippery slope. don’t care it’s Covid, goverment say need live normal life.

I really hope I’m stupid alarmist won’t gateway power abuse, considering track record various goverments throughout history, I’m hopeful. peeps, I'd feel way. Actually, American, blame people banning us we're taking right precautions. tell kids everything goes window comes safety. like peripheral health care! home office setup dual monitors working laptop couch/bed? I’m guessing haven’t invested make productive company hasn’t helped expense this. kind work in? sure don’t miss social interaction office, wouldn’t consider productive. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree, think number recovered, exposed immune, lot twice that. Gottlieb saying thought 30% population exposed end January example. I’m infected virus, cat? trying avoid becoming brazil point. people getting downvoted page entirely different demographic asking simple, relevant important question?

It age groups shown substantial differences. US politicians elites seem bought way getting vaccinated immediately UK got special privelages compared general population - PM got first shot mid march health secretary yet he's healthy 50 thus eligible.

The USA kinds issues due politicization (politicians diverting supply areas need votes, rather areas need) etc.

I can't believe general population USA happy way vaccine prioritization going. Thursday, weather great past days much country, people about, demand probably peaking around now....

I'm thinking get really close 2m first doses today. Yes will. 

That isn’t what’s discussed. What’s discussed whether it’s better clinics private sector. 

The answer it’s better clinics private sector vaccinate. Again, isn’t debate. That’s literally data says, Biden administration shifted mass vaccination site plan one centered neighborhood areas people familiar with. 

You’re arguing point that’s disproven. stuck it? reframe perception based data. like plan drinking lot. Tailgating, fishing, camping, stuff like that. Never get drunk, keep going without passing out.

If plan one two I'll go beer flavor. mean anti vax aren’t going get kids vaccinated too

Normal people vaccinate kids Lockdown wear mask till 2025 right? need prevent going out, enforecement pretty weak already lot ways cheat system. still one strain Covid-19, thinking variants Anyone else problems vaccine tracker’s filters? got Johnson Johnson recommended tried filter Pfizer, cost appointment 17. Haha shit. 5-7 months freezing temps years single day plus 30. Wish somewhere canada tropical. Legally, mandating “emergency use” vaccines campuses still gray area vaccines FDA approved. approved, though, imagine timeline speed substantially. Totally. try walk daily don’t always motivation without destination. disagree. strategy dangerous. vaccine 100% effective begin with. None yet thing ""vault door"" novel virus. also need time let antibodies build period time varies person taking mask right away acting like immune really unwise thing do. might protection severe disease antibodies would slow development illness would ever chance cause serious cell damage silver bullet. Florida's population smaller Canada's, lot half. also consider man's mortality moral outrage justifying several years dystopia, that's personal philosophical. admin kept entire freshman class except ""special circumstances"" home spring, junior senior class home fall. parents students allowed admissions visits

Oh, I'm required play football mask helmet. 

If require vaccines mandate masks I'll definitely anti vax shit. tired upvote 'board' wont infect people people bothered get vaccinated. morons like themselves. Maybe little evolution good thing, Well replying thread notice year old point. Private bars clubs could also start scanning HIV entering premises too, reduce spread epidemic. many horrible things happen precedent Hope wasn’t work computer phone. Erm, notice year old point. said weekly tests never came positive artificially inflating denominator, we've gone back standard acceptable rate? mean anti vax aren’t going get kids vaccinated too. Facebook mom groups cesspool spreading anti vax information. 

So schools require could see least middle elementary schools potentially waiting FDA approval emergency approval. Thank taking time add nothing value, usual. hours first dose Moderna also felt high. think lasted couple hours so. Never seen anyone else say that, thought losing mind. didn’t know New Zealand racist Indians. sad see. Yep, next would scanning HIV able enter bars clubs. reduce epidemic. mass invasion privacy discrimination contrary, verify people's religion everyone simply ""convert"" exempt.  would pretty easy obtain fake test result India.

Source? Also important note Israel offered vaccinate Palestinians several times, refused. far know PA getting vaccines Russia now. everyone could reasonable human beings cooperate? feels like EU adult around here. Ok Sorry uneducated, mean ""uncanny testing evasion""?

Asking Brazil, everything safe, still got deathly ill last 3 weeks, tested negative COVID went. watch interview. talks surges risks. headline accurate. dumb. fall semester long away now. There’s chance hell every college aged student country won’t opportunity get vaccinated next 5 months. either get vaccinated fall 2021 you’re safe, don’t get vaccinated implicitly accept risk catching coronavirus due decision. pretty much two options. cases, longer anyone else’s responsibility protect covid. That's what's happening US too. like get correlation distancing / lockdown lower cases say tralala, cases goimg down, let's open everything back up. Oh shit, cases going up? 😳 need play race card.

Who ""played race card""? guy mention race anywhere article. I've wondering this. husband got vaccination different state volunteered megasite. wonder able track vax back state. really pisses admins whatever want, answer absolutely one. least governors know can't keep bullshit restrictions everyone vaccinated, voters answer to. try pull mask bullshit fall we'd resort antivaxxer strategies, like rushing lecture hall unmasked fuckton people, vaccinated ppl course. aren't, may long term problems. pure selfishness get vaccine, you. Public health figures done bad job explaining risk vs reward vaccination among young healthy people.

Real world data shown vaccines use US stop symptoms majority people, reduce transmission.

If everyone get vaccinated so, transmission stops young sick get vaccinated stop getting Covid. virus stops circulating variants also longer concern. this, absolutely protect others around (even vaccinated people). 

That leaves concern Covid risky young healthy people. Again, public health figures failed. focusing deaths give information needed. Young people die Covid frequently, potential long term effects common might think.

Studies professional collegiate athletes shown 1-3 percent develop myocarditis. number long haul issues harder diagnose young people also end with, even myocarditis 1 100 odds good odds. means vaccines need less dangerous Covid right? using Astra Zenica US, three use absolutely safer Covid. vaccinated, though? vaccines show extremely good protection everyone, healthy 20 year old who's vaccinated, worry? Surely large first world country like NZ create quarantine hotels? much smaller country like Taiwan handling without issues banning citizens entering. hand, lot people made drive able hang elderly parents, host parties, dine restaurants, travel without guilt concern. Somehow ID vote rascist? sick fucks want go back full time? mean new normal conspiracy nuts? Yeah... already felt like severe hangover fever time, can't imagine actual hangover ontop that. Pfizer seems popular US.

I hope Australia able secure doses need.

I'm keen Australia medication take manufactured there. idea downvoted, right. Children huge risk though heard? Reddit. don’t understand it’s healthy friends coworkers actually enjoy company others. media says hospitals always brink almost collapse never collapsed

That hospitals usually collapse, unless hit cruise missile. Care rationed unlucky people die, hospital still standing working best abilities.

""the hospital brink collapse"" journalist newspeak ""the hospital overwhelmed rationing care"". EU production also cover vaccine shipments countries due US blocking exports. Mexico Canada got Biontech vaccine US facilities instance, Belgium. walk availability south right (and many even vaccinate state visitors non residents). Even California places low demand allow walk ins. talking matter days anyone country go anywhere get it. Novavax looks great vaccine definitely speed US vaccination effort point. Anyone get shot NYS ran site?

Got 1st shot week ago, told 2nd appointment would get scheduled Id emailed confirmation. (this worked wife didnt give second thought).

Week later, still email. 

I called hotline, guy told go back 3 week mark. asked confirmation email casually like ""well, 2nd appointment system cant send one, show card fine"". 


Anyone experience like NYS location? 

I plan call hotline back next days see ever get different answer.. fact can’t see ridiculous you’re behaving disagree someone

I disagreed anyone. I'm asking back statement. Nothing more. looked comment history. spend day trolling sub it’s users

Show example troll someone. asking source ""trolling someone"" you? shove thing nose? can't imagine shit weekly ugh. Political rallies, religious functions, marriages festivals. Also preparing epidemics 20 years. ready first round SARS, bird flu, etc. system place made mandatory hospitals report pandemic cases coordination center worked like crazy lock areas potential spread.

I mean, probably similar system US place Trump Bolton disbanded US pandemic response team 2018. places Palestinians live arn't allowed exercise sovereignty equal rights citizens.

Because citizens.

At least outside east Jerusalem next even many refuses citizenship addressing training part comment make entire comment specific man. blatantly obvious outdoor transmission big factor. Germany, top level football (what us ppl call soccer...) allowed happening, without audience.

Is statement itself. I’m shocked downvoted. absolutely right. Since vaccinated haven’t gotten tested either, beforehand getting one every week (never tested positive). Quarantine time limit. It’s forty days. doesn’t stop disease long, ain’t gonna. hard find mouth breathing anti-science folks here. I'm sure thread back statement.

Then easy provide example. let's see it. 

So far, done made fairly insane sounding claim, said common was, refused provide example claim, insulted bunch people. 

Show example talking easy find. Pretty sure right. country exporting vaccines injecting population.

That's false. India vaccinated 75 million people far. number exported vaccines less 5 million, IIRC. heard immunity binary like that—if r=1.1 COVID spread slowly. won’t see fast surge like r=2. 

r also affected social distancing. r might &lt; 1 everyone cautious 1 start acting normal. Weather effect too. 

So transmissibility covid gradually reduce vaccinations increase.  I’m also concerned classification severe. said oxygen level dipping 93 hour considered severe Covid, vaccine trials. US, generally recommending pregnant women get vaccinated. either vaccines. doctor know do. comes back obesity. Severely obese 3x periodontitis (gum disease) healthy weight, merely overweight, it’s double. Same, can't wait done. Full Vax come. way deal vaccinate people. India rate take 2 years vaccinate 75% population. Indian needs 5 million vaccinations per day next week ideally reach 10 million vaccinations per day. Inefficient planning measures blame vaccination. would recommend watch explains issue detail. fact can’t see ridiculous you’re behaving disagree someone, disheartening best. good one friend.

Edit: looked comment history. spend day trolling sub it’s users. wonderful. Sounds like Ontario TBH morons Baltimore external plant manufacturing J&amp;J vaccines need jail criminal lack quality control. got fat government contracts think could get away incompetence again. FDA needs start jailing company executives. think majority Americans traveling without vaccine one don’t really care getting one first place. 

I mean literally months away everyone opportunity get vaccine, that, point, gotta start opening everything back bring life back normal. certainly increasing adult vaccination partly responsible maintaining reduction community transmission, can't sustain restrictions completely relaxed. 

This immunity reduction community transmission. sustained reduction, requires additional restrictions.

Whether sustained reduction remain low without public health restrictions yet seen. can't say achieved it, can't say sure have. Fuck online class way get excited.OAN growing place. 100% agreed. can't afford keep shit assuming we're vaccinated. Ontario lockdowns real though. Basically can't anything except alive. real life. failing deliveries 100million 5/6 promised time using production base set contract? don’t see it’s “ridiculously pessimistic,” tbh. someone works college campus, see straightforward matter-of-fact considering they’re trying give millions people sort idea might expect five-plus months now. 

The guidelines always eased/removed things going well. university officials predicted significantly increased on-campus activity, limits. schools expect students living campus attending classes person attending selected days — one way stagger head count limit classroom exposure. plan vaccines plenty testing “We’re going using face coverings,” Van Orman said. “We’re going lowering densities people certain areas. We’re going offering vaccinations campus, need tracking mechanisms perform contact tracing it’s called three vaccines administered nationally far, chances college faculty staff members could partially fully inoculated covid fall improving. Students generally fall well priority list receive covid vaccines, schools left hope vaccination adults keep covid rates low cause major campus outbreaks. may take months test assumption, depending vaccination disease rates, duration vaccine-induced immunity X-factor variants resistance existing colleges interpreting federal law prohibiting requiring staffers students vaccinated, shots granted emergency use authorization yet licensed Food Drug Administration. Obviously going regional one region problem it'd dumb think one world. Bonnie Henry said increase linked parts province community sports like hockey soccer, parents stay away games prioritized, like recent NHL playoffs, said, COVID-19 transmitted among socialized before, attending indoor outdoor said transmission COVID-19 games meant sports facilities close, even though they’ve pandemic measures place.

People socializing problem sports. restrictions eventually followed. realistic option. hard get back learning semester off. Also, would even this, even everyone around it, im still 5% likely get even sniffles completely protected severe disease. way would consider draconian restrictions similar 2020. Even implemented masks distancing, I'd pissed really options. find funny 2-3 weeks probably surplus vaccines places. I'm employing strategy ""wait easy"" long getting vaccinated change anything way live regards restrictions. be. trivially easy. not? I'm trying quit, thanks. used work enough B 1.1.7 don’t think many people blindly confident protection masks mask go normal life like makes invincible. would definitely detrimental, highly doubt it’s widespread attitude. ""more"" mean? article say.  main problem religious communities, Jewish Muslim. Like said, lot vaccinate kids huge problem throughout whole pandemic. Right international travel restricted vaccinated, enforcement joke ways around that. whole pandemic. Couple months issues come everytime. friends traveling around Vietnam vacation. Everything open, unless find case rapidly contain areas aggressively contact trace. Went family's home town tet, people everywhere. locked building, neighborhood, district, City. Whatever takes contain it. explain happened? Indian cases started dropping even vaccines continued drop last month believe. vaccines rolling out, cases skyrocketed?  That's depressing af, run work want get away family, supposed opposite. work done computer, option WFH. It’s 2021 tools systems security transparency Doug Ford made point ignoring, slandering, medical experts. endless stream half-measures hurt small businesses, letting big corporations developers way. 

The person appointed run vaccine distributions took paycheck province months, virtually nothing, left. *weeks* province ended week vaccines freezers started with. unacceptable.

The provincial leadership pandemic awful hope it'll enough sink PCs next election. blood clots associated AZ vaccine rare type deadly blood clot brain. 19 people died these. blood clots vaccines   Absolutely get this. like keep work home compartmentalized, find I'm pretty easily distracted home. lab office much conducive getting stuff done. stuff work also air gap, worked home, I'd limited could get done project honest everyone chance people's compassion vaccine deniers zero.

you lead horse water but.... mean sick exactly argument it?

I'm saying healthy individuals like know lose 12-60k people year flu right? knew someone hospitalized month got real bad case doctors convinced going die.

Is common? common enough shut economy mandate **all** individuals wear masks sure agree there. something think ideal society try reduce making conscious decision whole willing better society wearing mask minimal downside.

I'm saying sick less great went sick every week healthy like year straight. think (AND my) moral duty try minimize harm others includes spreading diseases kind literally costs nothing.

Other ""I want to"" exactly argument it?

Related, funny americans selfish thought Japanese people wore masks air shit. wear masks want spread disease. forward thinking society especially negative associated wear piece cloth around face around people. entire AstraZeneca operation one big mess. hype around insane year back, even FDA approving hate going office work better home.

According article least one private university Florida requiring vaccine. also talks possible legal issues. Correct, ~~one two private stadiums~~ (edit: Madison Square Garden) New York one thing. endorsed New York, seems like essentially every Governor that's spoken firmly against

You know, that's interesting point. We've governors Florida, Texas, today, Idaho issue executive orders varying degrees actual effectiveness. (Florida one actually bans private companies mandating them, knowledge). I'm surprised governors come them. got raise, idea how. productivity abysmal. team changed completely 4x I've job 9? months. 

Whatever, checks keep clearing (and growing!). Good, starve beast consumerism wage slaves capitalism.

Universal Basic Income future fuck wage slavery! That’s funny I’m looking pick second job post pandemic paycheck joke I’ve dropped 12 hours 9$ that’s nothing compared old 40 hours 12$ hella good area  Y'all get check get paid? y'all use direct deposit time? Well $68k also taxes Good know! I'm looking forward ceding control thoughts body AI overlords get chills? long last? someone prefers wfh, think occasional social check (like week) coworkers would helpful motivating. also live side town work would like area work every again. I'd ok permanent wfh though. Alrighty, that's two Republican governors traditionally Democratic states said no. fingers crossed Hogan comes way soon. Q1 hands announced even going think reopening HQ offices 2021. firm even trying coordinate return office everyone vaccinated employee’s kids return safely school. company scattered across country pandemic happy WFH. HOWEVER really spooked us opening offices Midwest. PROMISED weren’t going move west coast roles over, they’ve hiring aggressively person roles office closer largest manufacturing facility. offices employee salaries would lot cheaper bay. high alert company really proved shady massive zoom layoff spring 2020. Meanwhile, IBS high anxiety self best year ever working bed couch. would cultural divide matter comes ability something almost everyone stopped using cheques decade ago lol. There'd 5 people country using service, would complete waste money banks implement.  union that? Basically trade unions work certain level (journeyman equivalent) get cost living increases that. Unless right work state unions seem much power. trying dick. curious. saw 1 4 adults US fully vaccinated. resulted drop cases? work they're already planning calling everyone back. Completely stupid unnecessary. Tax ""work"" home people give actually work like doctors, firefighters, electricians, nurses, cashier's, etc.  save around 300$ month (train pass + gas get station). way see it, got raise. also absolutely love fact dress however want (no dress clothes), bother makeup, commuting (3hrs day total), office small talk, etc. 

Honestly, ever want go back office full time. job (senior sysadmin consultant) even require physically office anyways. Everything manage different datacenters away office. different team site anything requires manual intervention since datacenters highly secure (bank stuff). 

I love quiet home, open cubicle madness. get take break go outside dog minutes there. go jog lunch time, quick errand like going grocery store, etc. social anxiety much comfortable work home. there's lot ""one final spike"" ""maintained line"" really kept precautions 2 months. Oh well. Fully authorized = deemed safe

Are really asking college held health safety standards US government?



The answer plain day


Safety job better WFH stuck cubicle drab office day. work home office, sofa, backyard deck, bed, bathtub, whatever fuck feel much better it. feel better freedom, I’m going better work less time. pay now. Good. feel. I’m getting trucking license never going back staying fucking room three years. 
Enough, I’m done. I’ll tell when/if pass road test, hahah.  YUP Nah still bad. pay offered low employers assuming people desperate. still one side think see it. They're probably working something else, office interrupt derail quickly help get faces. hurts difficult, longer term work. contrast remote efficiently jobs stack smaller tasks together done involved things. Preach, husband’s door door Times two hours...drive train, train, second train, walk work (and it’s short walk). 4 hours day commuting.

The amount time back kids incredible. Ay least Mexico really dont know anyone says they'll use required. mom still skeptical vaccine “long term side effects”. I’ve tried alleviate fears mind it. Ultimately it’s choice really wish would get 53 year old cancer survivor purposefully led media fear-mongering. Covid extremely serious, flu. many things much dangerous someone 20 Covid. Driving car many times likely kill disable you.

They mask get vaccine. risk zero, there's nothing life zero risk.

Now, 70- probably stay home even go masked unless life death fully vaccinated.

Flu absolutely affects healthy young people devastating ways. People always get flu shot. Yea get you’re saying, wanted explanation put words mouth. don’t disagree 20 somethings receive 80+, can’t blame people wanting get state opening everyone. supply issue hesitancy issue, especially Detroit? That's going anything vaccine spending it. No, massive advertising campaign stating much works, social media, streaming services, etc focus 16-30 demographic absolutely can, will. 

I work historically progressive company NYC they’ve talking bad wanna go back office. 

They say really miss “coffee talk” hallway banter. thats bullshit course. 

We heard funniest shit today. They’re audit analysis make office experience friendly video conferencing. deadass said call, want make experience “just like working home you’re used to!”

Idk need pay company tell give everybody logitech webcams headphones. looked historical data weeks ago find . I'll see find something really think feds phase remote working home virtually via skype try get everyone inoculated (fully vaccinated) return back full-time, in-person office work buildings, maskless. lady trained new job come back remote work. seen past days saw boss clean desk. Today first day back home. must made stink make announcement. still couple months get remote. hope UBI exists die. Yeah, people era get it. generally spend 15 20 minutes chatting coworkers day. Right 90% office strictly work home us hybrid. It’s really interaction get daughter bf take advantage it. sounds horrible. :/ Never said it’s warranted, sure you’re getting that. I’m saying issue quite time something that’s tried improved decades. there’s public outcry people finally realize it’s issue. consideration given fact getting COVID likely stressful even traumatic experience many leading increased diagnoses anxiety/mood disorders? Anxiety mood disorders also impact cognition things remembering, planning, prioritizing, following tasks; sleep alertness; attention; etc. Could think impacts COVID really impacts *experience* COVID? Honestly i'm leaning towards Enough remote working home virtually via skype. time get everyone inoculated (fully vaccinated) return back full-time, in-person office work buildings, maskless. Good question. still send puppy doggie daycare get socialization (since can't dog park pandemic) honestly get hair spend energy difficult work days. I'll pass. remote support get way work comfort home working without zillion interruptions constantly folks want chat. smart! :/ That's debate, legal Florida. would rather lose limb go back office deal traffic that. Full non-compliance option point. seeing want, want. job remotely Boise someone much cheaper Beijing. Working home lead massive offshoring white collar jobs usual discipline .... suspension, ISS, detention, things improve disengagement. 1% people want go back must worst people earth!  Oh pal even get started... Everything suggests kids people 50 ones overrun hospital even worst case scenario.  still answered question. there's $3 trillion ""infrastructure"" bill, really product government giving people unemployment get paid job. can't make office? better union though.

Sounds like would agree rather differ hospitals close overwhelmed understand. Canada behind terms immunity country. Hope works one take degree seriously. Yeah I’m pissed. I’ve quarantining year we’ve got variants: found 2 cases p.1 county South African variant cases growing next county mine. I’m half vaccinated husband variants lower efficacy hospital currently 100% capacity scares shit me. want normalcy, get back life creative work, see family state seems like it’s never going happen. 

After incredibly anxious (and careful) year, began feel much better first shot that’s gone now. *still* worry getting sick variants. done. Same. still week half go. Really wishing I’d able get J&amp;J done it. I'm condescending playacting ignorance. 

This entire conversation started re: whether businesses would forced use vaccine passport. I've told repeatedly that's what's happening, continue try wriggle around make assertion correct. not. one forced use vaccine passports. option businesses states. states also allow business owners demonstrate they're taking measures ensure safety health patrons operate fewer restrictions instant public health crisis. I'm sure make clear. one forced anything. Business owners make choice either way (and yes, choice likely impact business financially - still inarguably choice, coercion).

Your new points make sense. There's way anyone signed contract past year assuming whatever venue they're booking operating full capacity (so capacity ""cut"" comply ""new rules"" - could possibly larger crowd planned behave pro-social manner). Even someone signed contract venue January 2020 event held June 2021, contract could easily voided force majeure clause (which standard events contracts).

I worked catering events setup fifteen years, I'm expert front law, know way around events. chances SARS-Cov-2 already present wild mice, considering following:
B.351 P1 infect mice
The B1.351 P.1 variants extend SARS-CoV-2 host range mice | Sure, mRNA still much better. aren’t saying “it’s flu, bro”, people making Long Covid like it’s novel thing fact similar side effects seen viruses. Funny that... I'd rather quit continue work home full time. find evidence Osterholm thought swine flu would comparable 1918. mRNA obviously.  Thank answering! fact many people keep masks mandates end. folks miss people unvaccinated waiting turn get shot value safety avoid COVID. refuse shot lost cause anyhow. companies proactive smart, others stubborn stupid. frugal years don’t need employer anymore. need anything two weeks notice, they’re going give want. According gf works medical assistant, anywhere 40-70 percent effective virus first dose. Second brings 80 90. 
The reason two shots full blown vaccine, taken really brutal (dare say fatal cases) essentially breaking two help ease process body.
This course information provided doctors works told her. Harvard study means colloquially excepted stats amongs medical professionals works with.
What I'm saying is, essentially pretty safe (much anyone single shot) catch it, noticeably less symptoms normal. probably going bring asymptomatic levels could achieve full dose however. Germany number two US came investments. second Pfizer shot last week. every symptom CDC website, 30 hours shot, feeling good again. Exactly, lots fear mongering “long Covid” stuff. sick back 2016 sort respiratory infection week two issues wheezing like six months that. “long” whatever infection there, isn’t unique thing Covid. happens, it’s normal. wonder “long Covid” reports may psychosomatic nature, too.

It always bothers inconsistent people Covid. People take overzealous precautions Covid don’t anything else life, even situations may even dangerous.

Also, know number people Covid none reported “long Covid” symptoms, I’m convinced it’s common often thought, either. Well...that actually thing! Hope so. Maybe book trip London soon! trying plan wedding since 2019. Read link article attached. say dominant variant.  make two fantastic points here:

1) thought deterrent effect practice might produce.

2) really need figure society better help working families obtain inexpensive, on-the-spot child care ""put kids school bus"" everyday. dumb decision, really hope major universities decide go back normal style college pressures rest want ""keep students safe stay remote"" follow suit.  Thank this! caught tail end AMA sadly (I'm huge fan TWiV)... I'm curious updates studies potential long covid fully vaccinated individuals. know Dr. Daniel Griffin covering occasionally I've missed last couple episodes, apologies already discussed recent update. Wild lol. think I've handed check everytime I've paid last 4 5 years working job work now. 

I know there's something tangible holding check like ""Yeah fucking worked this, shit hands feels good, feels like money"" type beat y'know? 

Maybe that's american thing guess. Nope, contrary...they done earlier, including hard lockdown. would lived go mass site CA could get appt. settled 1 hr drive big city suburb pharmacy... twice. got first Pfizer dose yesterday. raging headache within two hours getting it, still bad yesterday, slept 15 hours drenched bed sweat. 

I'm still glad got it, second dose lined up. percentage population covered, amount doses. trials new vaccine kids?  NHsS sabotaging vaccine rollout ensuring could own, absolute disaster. really dont think keep monopoly Hi Dr. Racaniello, remember TWiV podcast early 2020 theory coronavirus become less deadly pandemic continues. believe happened pandemic? bat shit. yet risk fully reopening things arbitrary times? seems like governments risk lives citizens convenient. Efficacy 14 days first shot second shot ~80% CDC guidance right need quarantine test **fully** IKR Thank much help.

Understanding read data better really helps put perspective good current vaccines even variants. really exciting stuff! Based gov.co.uk 19 people died blood cloths, 3 30, 8 30 50 8 50. county 500k 40% adults vaccinated, 11 people hospital 3 ICU. large senior population/community. please provide link? thank I'd love proven wrong. facts think suggest otherwise? read somewhere still spread covid even vaccine. true? saving money several years take multi year break working. teach new software programming skills turn business job. Kent Margate strain! done one producers inventors best vaccine. Instead actually exported lot - including USA UK look people first normal government would. IDK switch format replacing single thread getting daily... numbers title need click ""megathread"" find them. Also get stickied what's point? response exactly efficacy vaccines never jumped media outlets shared generate click driving headlines.

As much strong transparency government people serve, number rolled public vaccines 1 0 - works doesn’t. variant efficacy.

Now? bunch Facebook news experts saying “well, don’t want *that* vaccine. want *good* one”, it’s harming recovery return normal. Thanks sharing. Definitely interesting food thought, particularly someone like scientific background. 

That said, still think raises question ""CDC-lite"" pandemic may looked like. Thinking world where, instead continuously reiterating super cautious guidelines due incentive structure flagged, took back seat let policy makers follow limited real time science quickly. 

Maybe I'm overly optimistic, feel like alternative world could better. Full blown lockdowns would still likely implemented beginning scientific findings would overwhelmingly encouraged people mask within couple weeks/months, school closings restrictions things like outdoor dining would lifted earlier vectors transmission became better understood. worry, neighbours west equally inept government. Yes. Especially certain states going particularly high vaccine uptake like Texas Mississippi. Give people ample time get vaccinated want let rip.

I think children going family decision. places low low vaccine uptake, families making decisions. hard core isolation, person activities. data here, right? missing?

Probably, especially people disease. far behind studying virome! We've barely made inroads microbiome.

&amp;#x200B;

These great questions, thank you!! shot questions:

Does matter vaccine get? choose one get?

Doesn't matter. Take vaccine get, save life.

What say antivaxxers?

Who paying trash vaccines?

Vaccine immunity start kick 11 days, likely mild course COVID.

What can't get shot?

Don't take anti-inflammatory drugs before. exercise day days after.

What upsides downsides getting one dose two different vaccines? safety issues?

Take number doses recommended vaccine: one J&amp;J, two Pfizer, Moderna US. safety issues getting two, get one two dose course, make sure get second dose point (does right away) get maximum immune memory. weren’t GPS allowed vaccinate patients first place? Hard agree last point. It’s everyone’s interest every country vaccinated, particularly neighbours usual. would changing minds point. Small pox polio eradicated themselves... 🙃 seems pretty obvious me. even so, way definitively know would try it, one charge willing take risk, pointless.

Government refuses play social science experiments lives citizens, news 11. usa ex prez, straight away denied existence Coronavirus.

No didn't. put travel ban China talked confirmed cases time. flip side, office said going permanently WFH 5 days/week, quit job (or thrilled, social person nature), would move. I've committed urban-ite years year apartment -- separate office, backyard, finished basement -- killing me. many kids have? Hahahah no. moving goals posts like again. Kids never real risk. They’re statistically risk flu never required vaccine schools. getting vaccines early, particularly cause significant side effects. you’re bit dramatic assuming worst. let things play months see numbers continue drop may well even shape things come future. colleges probably aiming completely online future get rid physical buildings. That’s trajectory CC’s least That's important point. well COVID mean? Perhaps element evaluated also able successfully manage virus resorting constant lock-downs. Lock-downs got used countries failed get stuff right anything else. support use mass lock-downs save lives, represent failure. It’s basically lifted. People wear masks time bars close? Really really late. 

It’s 90% back normal downtown Columbus. genetically prone Periodontal disease (10% tested populations fall this). 5 years back warned weight diabeties early last year managed remission, dental work since then. Diet seemed greatest benefit gums teeth, flossing brushing (but it’s good habit). vaccines even work 112 year olds? I'm hell time getting vaccine. I'm subscribed text messages notify appointments, work pretty strict weekday schedule. think would real nice weekend slots area... Let’s check back another days AZ another glaring safety issue it’s use halted yet another country every western vaccines avoid issues. You’re welcome keep head sand address concerns brought sorta like people test, positive results get. Ya,
But usa ex prez, straight away denied existence Coronavirus.


N helped spikes usa.
Similarly North Korea said hv cured patients.
Turkish govt declared, hv cases. govts, lied world. It’s also really nice out. People going outside able keep windows open day even night. wonder affect. Yeah sorry. referring staff. idea generally. made clearer! Even then, chances one extremely rare clotting events small like 1:20,000,000, right? Definitely right approach want another Rudy Gobert since first NBA player get COVID-19 Serie Bergamo style incident post vaccine schedule timeline/breakdown yet? look forward every day. Thanks sure downvoted. AZ extremely successful roll across UK. Cases dropped dramatically. so-called 'concerns' confirmed false. 

It's like majority people shares Pfizer. 80% 2 weeks first shot....probably around 60% week, given seems logarthmic. Everything definitely lifted Ohio.... Glad understand stats better him, doctor. wear sun screen even cloudy. daughter's school, even though kids notoriously asymptomatic infected Sars-cov-2.

I've heard one student walk door fever - COVID-19 induced otherweise - I've asked times. hope people started realising freedoms free anymore. gave cheaply. normalcy set world fire get freedoms back. ""Normal-ish"" last forever allow it. would better informed stopped listening him. man thought Swine Flu would lead worst flu pandemic since 1918 Honestly think going change quickly, like next 2-3 weeks, US globally. care, want jab. Asian people (which am) less likely develop blood clots first place anyway.

As healthy young person unlikely see needle fall. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* bars stay open schools closed, one thing, pants head stupid. 

Schools(especially early grades) last thing close first thing reopen, even meant takeout. Net-zero harm, someone else gets shot

This would problem people stopped taking AZ altogether

There's still demand supply can't imagine would issue either way needs tested get FDA approval. Err, i'm not? information already outdated:


""In 15-20 percent samples from Indian state Maharashtra (the state accounting 62 percent cases country) new, double mutation key areas virus detected. known E484Q L452R Thanks again. I'll go lick South African avocados then. prefer follow case numbers rather vaccination rates, since kids vaccinated time soon. case rates low, continue ease restrictions. party like 2019 right away though. hindsight (which wonderful thing), think UK (Kent variant) indeed transmissible original strain circulating Wuhan ?

It seems becoming dominant many locales. Like, he's wrong. Olsterhold is. Take look pandemic trajectory Israel, another country B.1.1.7 dominate true line 0-19 yr olds would decreased rest population. vaccinated part., adults giving kids maybe high enough viral load community kids pass DRIVING spread. Olsterhold says shit like get ""omg vaccinate kids schools open."" Also leads outcome 5 yr old US vaccinated 70 yr old South America. true harming kids process. Public Health whole community COVID, long run he's harming community. care he's TV. maybe need look way post history said close borders right start, plenty time every country greed prevailed. idea possibly make decision early. going look foolish 90%+ schools open person 60-70%+ population vaccinated. odd Dr. know replied, clicked read got message ""that reply missing"". indeed, appear thread.

Perhaps could repost it? Exactly thought. Probably also chronic micromanagers people absolutely social life except office, like people rely solely office interactions co-workers social life. basically, EU gets less AZ vaccines it’s “they slow”, “they cheap” respond is: “But don’t look us, we’re blocking anything, don’t export anyone don’t call nationalism!” 

When EU enough lies deceit AZ introduced mechanism ensure guys don’t sneak vaccines like literally previous months Dutch site (the whole holding approval site written UK &amp; EU contract simply disgusting), EU gets accused export blocking?! EU Western country/institution export! stated above: 100 million. hadn’t exported all, EU total would vaccinated 22% population. 

So AZ feeling heat doesn’t even apply export Australia, cry EU blocking it? didn’t get blocked, know can’t push EU anymore. 
I’m sorry Australia AZ vastly oversold capacity seems unable make much progress. Join club: UK, EU guys, getting vastly less promised. it’s clearly AZ’s fault. 

Besides, article says AZ schedule January taken account certain blocks such... that’s 3 months ago. guys can’t even promise one month advance EU (all numbers April final yet). would think old schedule possibly still stand?

Only Pfizer make guarantees. don’t know tell you, man. know told me. I’m neither doctor, qualified. Yes, turn tables karma. conveniently forget occupying power controls get even move within West Bank Gaza. Area C West Bank complete Israeli control, that’s 60 percent population contained Area C, Israel responsible getting vaccine them. go 30 secs GR Detroit trump signs far see. Night curfew weekend lockdown reduce physical interactions. Mask mandate alone car doesn’t make sense. like 60% first dose 50% doses (full immunity) lot people rely solely office socialization social life. could never fathom personally case many. know people say ""good news this"", ""good news that"", see people dying everywhere, millions die tragedy. vaccines? want vaccines. I'm tired it. Last year, around october november, said everyone would hit hard new wave Covid-19 2021, nobody really cared. saying pessimistic, people answering post say. 

This shame, people future look us say: allowed that? yet people want smile feel good themselves. don't. want everyone safe vaccinated. Herd immunity? cost? many people left die, achieve herd immunity? close eyes fact giving priority vaccines, should?

We left people die wanted food delivered homes. people self isolated? relatives got Covid, many died. Good news? Where? There's nothing good getting through. good news EVERYONE vaccinated. possible? Make possible. Pharmaceutical companies, get ass huge profits start making happen. Governments, companies, same. I'm tired shit, I'm tired people pretending good moment nothing happening. 

This like Titanic, rich, safe are. self isolate work home office. still earn salary comfort. People need go work. exposed virus. Thousands dying everyday. No. There's nothing good it. Yes government shutting since there's turmoil nethanyahu believe generally worse access healthcare also tend live multigenerational housing average american Absolutely. day wanted go ask boss question design working on. arrived office saw door closed, could hear typing away keyboard inside. swiftly kicked door broke lock clean door. 

It’s part working office environment guess. Well change otherwise. Non-citizens/Permanent Residents already banned entering NZ year, matter country come from. ban citizens temporary measure, 28 April. easier way ""loan"" doses mexico canada article says acceptable workaround. Woosh production outpaced domestic demand anyway, big cities get vaccinated shopping mall sports venue (no need schedule appointment, brig passport insurance policy) huge lines. amount times heard: I’m antivaxxer, BUT...” 🤦🏼‍♂️ also test way Canada does. happen source handy? work passed fliers last Thursday sign vaccinations site 600 people(roughly 2,000 employees). got J&amp;J, mild aches, breeze.  Yeah, there’s massive increase drop bear attacks. Sure covid picky infecting ""rich"".

Your excuse pathetic I’m 25yo woman willing get vaccinated heard blood cloths deaths related vaccine. still want get vaccinated I’m scared. think %25 scared like me, necessarily anti-vaxxers. IIRC Germans negotiating buy Sputnik V **after** approved EMA. Slovaks also noted Russia *still* provided data need order approve drug use. can't blame Astrazeneca, like all. third party plant contracted J&amp;J AZ directly run neither them. Huh. We're running vaccines lol yep Indian living Australia able travel NZ bubble starts week referencing cases people died shortly vaccinated cause death wasn’t immediately determined.
I didn’t follow see cause deaths were.
There couple scare articles people dying vaccination. Dummies right used vaccine caused death cause death wasnt determined. guess say ""Thing happened entirety Germany"" report pieces legislation either No, problem rural MI like cross Texas New Hampshire bunch Live Free Die gun nuts refuse comply. Lockdowns work, idiot population know listen. I'm scheduled vaccine tomorrow thank goodness 10% said would rather die I'm part 2%, cheated rat race. moved 3 miles workplace. terrible attention issues I'm home, working would good fit. university hosting vaccination event later month. Well, say Alma Mater. Glad they’re something right Stop spreading false news. Israel paid (a higher price) got. (yet) permit payment future doses 2022 (due political argument), all. really negative.
Yes talks opening up, numbers need allow that.
And understand opening outdoor dining terraces. 
First proof covid doesn’t spread outdoors, read Irish research (0.1%)
Second: saw parks Amsterdam full younger peoples don’t practice social distancing, least terraces monitor steer better. switched bosses, old one text book describe, new boss gets shit Corona times, quick 1 1 everyone week, gauge mood help us stuck something. better boss Covid old boss before. Palestinians refused vaccinated Israel part numbers. hard understand keep going rhetoric either way like I'm sure nutjob Yeah, don’t get island narrative way COVID infect country illegal immigrants sneak across border. No, literally flew welcomed countries still airport containment measures. old manager chains now? Yep. They're people anti-mask anti-lockdown.

On plus side, hear fastest way get vaccine find reddest zip code near check availability there. I'm still waiting letter (UK)

Hopefully anti-vax turn vaccine hesitancy vaccines prove effective safe. Astrazenica helping matters much, least bad press seems focused it. Well, bother looking also 2h right.

Germany also 16 different states varying covid legislation also can't say anything exactly entire country said, started development 2018 since normally takes several years approval, approved. Unlike Covid, urgency approving new influenza vaccines. That's normal procedure followed. Mask culture culture hygiene  see doesn’t make sense though? get Pfizer vaccine 100% protection death covid shown trials. don’t get exposed covid high chance dying chrons conditions. CDC doesn’t seem say it’s unsafe either. Doctors misdiagnosed friends chrons 5 years. They’re always right  Walensky said saw doom horizon. Welcome back.

Its since last shitting Sweden.

Turns Swedens aproach led one [lowest increases mirtality rates shunned strict lockdowns choked much global economy, emerged 2020 smaller increase overall mortality rate European countries, analysis official data sources showed. half-sarcastic testing numbers. NZ acted early heavier hand. success story far. Yes. one tiny part UK, UK like stated original post UK roughly 8 times population roughly 8 times many cases (fluctuating obviously). feeling hopeful  Define ""valid"" comes religion.

An organization gone legal process becoming officially recognized church. ""I'm spiritualist"" 
""we believe natural healing"" kind shit. Yes, two entities way restricted occupied xenophobic ethnostate.... people drove around bumper stickers saying “Let freeze dark” ended freezing dark. insane pushed back Olympics another year minimum. Ran grit, guess. Trump blocked travel Chinese people specifically. American, Mexican, African, Russian, whatever, free travel China.

That's people called racist. Perhaps, also viral vector India

Not *Indians* hope CureVac delivers expected, learned AstraZeneca always need plan B, probably C well. FYI got New Zealand week ago luckily leaving soon UK bank mobile app, make payment anyone business name/account no/sort code. app allows put phone number, app need details, get link get money account. fee use/receive. Another Karl Rock fan haha love see Main dilli se hoon. Seems like that’s schools too. It’s next school year still. Even it’s it’s fully approved point zoom don’t trust evidence you’ve show. really apply work, us customer facing, even work people sell things buy consumer. 
Honestly comment feels outdated SHOW RESUME, TELL READY WORK. Yea maybe credit fact they’re great masks cleanliness.

Last heard PA bought vaccines Russia EU. Actually, anecdotal mini-study, Moderna consistently one greater side effects. super interesting worldwide Covid experiment done figure means! Palestinians governments (Palestinian Authority West Bank Hamas Gaza) run health systems negotiate drug/vaccine deals own. Last heard PA bought vaccines Russia EU. Please. US behind Romania comes UK variant prevalence. recent study saying 100% random samples UK variant. like 2-3 months. Oh sheeeif. We’re trouble America imperial ton anti-vaxxers. Trial participants jabs exactly longer term trials, results would exactly same. 1/250000 chance developing blood clot probably discovered trial 10-20 thousand people. put perspective FDA estimate 3-9 women 10,000 birth control get serious blood clots, that's use decades. It’s little nuanced. It’s possible herd immunity masking social distancing, threshold people go way back normal. Basically herd immunity dependent people’s behavior immediately imply forget virus. got downvoted right. professors job home precedence someone working job interact people person? high risk people, mention. That's crisis whole. People agree everything government did, i.e. lockdowns, enough support businesses out-of-work individuals, strict enforcement among Tel Avivim basically enforcement mass gatherings Haredim. everyone agrees chaos, least got vaccine rollout right. Apparently not: plus personal hygiene cremations. definitely news me. kind touched trying get across though. *""They build work whatever friends left high school college.""* question last time people made friends begging asked? avenues difficult find friends with?(pre-Covid) time ability make friends everyone trying hustle way ladder.

Young people driving force get people back office. time goes people manager sees get opportunities etc. older people feel going back office even explicitly told to. Thanks, read research however can’t find people say didn’t experience symptoms whether it’s Reddit elsewhere. Anyways it’s probably nothing worry about. coming back pretty quickly, restaurant scene already largely returned. going back school monday left spring brake last year coming back. whole year mentally checked float through. happy go back tho got vaccine think back person keep engaged socialized again. get you. guess trying say really middle management pushing stuff. starts top.

I like certainly hope something changes this. we've learned one thing work fact keep place running people can't make work takes little management effort. attempts blame US UK EU incompetence. 

It’s simply dishonest point. 

The EU bet cheaper vaccines didn’t pan out, later. EU ordered 400 million Sanofi vaccines 100 million Pfizer. Leaving Pfizer free sell vaccines excess 100 million. 

If Sanofi vaccine panned out, EU wouldn’t shortage did...and course wouldn’t exporting 400 million vaccines. Oh wow - 11-6 mostly pharmacies seem getting more. Go back re-read original expert analysis US destroying general practitioner program Germany allows small communities access care. 

Do that, tell weren’t commenting access. stand corrected, case. deaths trending downwards.

I wonder hospitalizations look like month now, I'm surprised bit uptrend, imagine continue trend upwards.  hope well. 

Do friends family nearby could ask check you? mild side effects fiancé got shots time. happy it. Felt crappy headachey day nothing major. especially worried fiancé cause deal well sick fine. workplace still too, hilarious thing winter everyone reading low-to-mid nineties since cold outside. someone comes 101 fever even get screened anyway.

I bet drop real quick gets hot summer people come false positive fevers regular. Could give details negative reactions? So, right now, companies freely export plants US? months, right now. Answer question talk. “adverse events equaled 0.62 percent 1,700 people vaccinated site Wednesday”

Oh, way, swine flu *was* pandemic. wrong that, either. read links full now, see nowhere says X happen, X something happen. see said things *could* happen, didn't, prepared case do.

I sympathy either party here. AZ pathological liars EU diversified orders. Today's US update - 3.403m total doses; 2.05m first doses. amazing badly Europe lagging vaccine supply considering Pfizer j&amp;j vaccines jointly developed European pharma companies. J&amp;J actually developed Belgian subsidiary. reddit told Cinemas done Netflix destroyed them? Correct! clarified. No, isn’t. Although would like more.

You can’t read article pointing issue US assume haven’t read similar article another country, issue doesn’t exist country. 

And vice versa. Night aufhören! Ich bin fast soweit!!! Small pox vaccine definitely does. that, Emergent, plant botched involved Anthrax vaccine fiasco, needs check another 62 million doses contamination reported New York Times. Literally impossible understand point. - see Slide 5. 

(D614G primary variant US early June 2020: ) what, Tell families loved ones dead injured relatives bid deal. personally give somewhat pass delayed second lockdown, trying push , met incredible resistance.

The vaccine supply problems Germany definitely Jens Spahns fault. Lucky us, biontech exceed delivery targets 25% Modena able hold delivery targets. Reinstalling be....complicated Although may think ""continue access services"" real-world version simple. Mental health hard enough get even fully paid. However many insurances still require copay's parents willing support (drive, pay, etc) outside school. 


There large batch kids get 3 sessions. Think magically fixed 3, think therapy work them. I've seen play many times ""limited trial therapy"" leads people actually seeking therapy. husband first dose Moderna 2 weeks ago. headache arm soreness. sore arm, headache, body aches, fever. felt like bad flu. okay 2 days shot though. expecting worse response second dose though we've requested day work. Made mistake first dose. got scheduled vaccine said they’d use J&amp;J vaccine... worried? seems like fringe case either 6:45 EDT 13:30 EDT works well J&amp;J's QC caught it, actual 3rd party plant Emergent Biosolutions. J&amp;J contracted Emergent went found royally f'd up. Tale 2 vaccines (first dose), wife got Moderna zero effects outside sore arm 12 hours. got Pfizer mess 24 hours. Felt like flu weakness aches fever. 

This stop getting second dose. unfortunately article failed name variant known suspected significant mutations. could named mutations even variant designation yet looked outbreak.info uses GISAID data track variants concern variants interest: brazil report problems country South African discovered variant B.1.351 a.k.a. 20H/501Y.V2 detected virus variants would fight death instead fighting people animals. Gross National Happiness, indeed.  I'm afraid full report released, summary statement, know details differences composition. 

 
Our ex-PM hastily bought Sputnik health minister ""approved it"" condition regulator ""reviews"" data confirms start vaccinating. 

However instead problems reported government last week, officially still commenting results report.

Composition changes might still okay, main problem discrepancies what's submitted EMA/Lancet Russian side either unable unwilling explain it.

Providing children mental health care pandemic isnt virtue signaling literally government exactly want of. yet find single person uses term correctly. Sure however kinda hope that's really case personally speaking id rather take vaccines now. think understudied currently safety especially since going risk 18 healthy. mean want take studied tho, anytime soon type thing.

I guess thats matter discussion  felt like needed nap every day 10 days since getting first Moderna shot, would insomnia night midnight. went away started taking iron Vitamin pills. 

Could coincidental also lined exactly got shot. I’m looking forward second dose it’s better getting Covid! Obviously restrictions need end eligible adults want vaccinated vaccinated. Schools able get back normal point too, let kids masks (if earlier).

The reason take exception would vaccines working well expected deaths hospitalizations failed plummet sub-flu levels even mass vaccination. Based everything we're seeing live numbers studies vaccines' efficacy variants (re: preventing severity/deaths) reason think happen. stays way lifting restrictions critical mass vaccination happens absolutely non-negotiable. Antibodies one part immune system, know protection convalescent immunity lasts least 7 months longer. Go /r/COVID19 type “reinfection”. You’ll find Israel Study, Dutch Study, SIRENS study, showing robust long term protection previous covid infection.

And covid alone kill 500,000 people. Something like 96% people comorbidities like heart disease, diabetes, obesity hypertension. Covid straw broke camels back, chronically sick country nobody seems encourage us get healthier improving diet lifestyles. 

We see long immunity lasts covid infection. SARS 1 infections provided nearly decade protection, what’s say won’t similar? Last summer, Pfizer asked federal help sourcing material needed ramp production vaccine, feds refused. Later on, feds tried order additional doses Pfizer already committed entire production capability like June year - production capability limited get enough source material.

The feds used DPA divert material sent candidates sent Pfizer instead. That's US got second hundred million doses Pfizer.

I wonder stuff got redirected Pfizer originally intended Curevac. Extrapolation* 

Interpolation estimate inside range data (in case, past) extrapolation estimate outside range (in case, future). It’s export ban.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* here! almost disappointed any. weird differently affects people. looked seemed pretty important. right. reported week ago places Brazil hospital system gone beyond ICU capacity therefore qualifies ""collapsed"" - made curious quoted metric - 500 dying per day lack ICU space. article published today subject - \- interviewee said hospital system long since collapsed number closer 700, still statistics body publishing corroborated data, problem clearly good possibly getting worse. honestly point article even? came really matter point, 99% people way verify information Nothing worse despot attacks scientists/thinkers. formula tried history - little success. No, isn't. many common illnesses treated nurse practitioners, physician assistants health care professionals situations require PCP. lack access lack quality like US backwater 3rd world hellhole - issue expensive people can't afford good health insurance either privately employer. 

If can't pick condescending part first message think part cultural upbringing. likely beginning June. guarantee person gave shot medical person. 

They probably physician, though. We're [BUILT DIFFERENT] Eh... one shot Pfizer better non variants JJ variants. Cant quite make next leap without data studies there's half million meat packers.

""We vaccinated like 5 people building, can't believe 400 getting sick!"" well understood yet, zero sum 0% protection maximum protection night day 13 14. possible active infection developing antibody production vaccine also kick sooner, one knows sure. Current CDC guidance says 7 days exposure negative test symptoms likely clear, however. would like take trust verify approach. People right know jab coming verified documentation getting it. would worked well small number countries, people handful more. rest seen years. Surprised germans far behind 'Not all. interest competing Europe, speak country. frank, whole political situation Europe boring absolutely interest me. simply personal opinion event we're position help people another country, countries Australia first foremost. And, there's good reason that: one actually. Lol good. Look forward updates everyday Getting kids back classroom 100% absolutely dictated kids getting vaccinated. Every American adult either vaccinated opportunity vaccinated then. time comes parents want kids vaccinated, sure get vaccinated, opening schools nationwide nothing vaccinating children. reddit prefilled headline pasted link didn’t know allowed edit prefill posting. added Australia part, thus learning actually edit headline post would accepted, didn’t want push don’t know tightly controlled sub is. last post removed containing ‘breaking’ headline picked different article didn’t prefill ‘breaking’ held information.
I’m opinion headlines brief description, whole story, figure capable reading articles interest find story about. Lol idiot age group exact hospitalization rates death rates flu. them....it flu. go age progressively gets worse worse outcomes compared flu, 50 year old much much dangerous flu. Thanks! post every day? miss wasn’t rules post r/coronovirus shot 2 Tuesday. arm little sore that's it. also classify conditions severe. Link?  50% 4/20......nice herd immunity means effectively see cases one-offs. high level resistances means see small scale surges. Think flu vs smallpox disaster. Chile might start again.. country 200 million inhabitants, think everyone living?

Even Sweden 10 million inhabitants 25000 towns. thing happened CO meanwhile single US mayor, governor, public health official fired incompetence negligence entire disaster. gross exaggeration study found. find ""30% COVID patients severe neurological issues 6 months later, Severe neurological issues stroke, aneurism dementia."". Dude. Everywhere carbon copy . messaging mess since thing began. can't tell many people giving horrible advice based actual things CDC said one point another. Bitte ;) Brazil list too. think still out, sure. jealous everyone else grumpy think relative size everything lol. yeah, hoping picks soon! Italy 80% adults vaccinated know I've seen chatter sub. [in  correct. J&amp;J collected variant information, 72% number US 96% cases tested verified classic D614G version, use make comparisons mRNA vaccines.)

(65% indeed including South African trials, variants come play lower number, though.) agree, total douche move US UK. ""please let die cruise ship peace."" turned 20. family member who’s fully vaccinated? see distance? Danke! Thank god live there. clicked profile—based fact last post frat/sorority culture, I’m going guess you’re college-aged. recent comment, also said aren’t experiencing symptoms.

You going fine. age, COVID serious risk unless you’re severely immunocompromised. There’s reason 80% deaths come people 65, 20% deaths still skewed older end under-65s. age group, COVID probably poses much risk flu. “A turn worse” means bad cold.

What do? Get rest, drink water, try stress out. stress isn’t good immune system. Isolate family, especially live people actually risk disease. Stay inside. 

That’s it! less two weeks, you’ll it. true. J&amp;J tested US “classic” variant mRNA vaccines were; sequenced majority positive cases 96% D614G.

J&amp;J’s one dose results 72%. indications mRNA vaccines achieve neighborhood 80% single dose far. ebola. math really thought would see PR, Big Pharma rescuing world, always emphasized elective drugs next big thing. that, they'd need good image, thought. wrong. Perhaps US UK start export? protesting complaining? I'd say accurate politicians representing citizens putting best interest first. Yes meet demand domestically also needing India. made sure get promises exclusive delivery investing.

Maybe read AZs contract EU. Yes, wear 3 masks case. People relatives actually like seeing?

My friend seen Canadian cousins year. trials likely included variants ones Moderna Pfizer, difference might real.

Not actually true - 96% variants J&amp;J trial standard type circulating US last year. (They sequenced collected data part study, don’t guess.)

It’s likely J&amp;J vaccine’s true effectiveness one dose indeed lower mRNA vaccines two. interesting see much booster shot improves J&amp;J’s results, course. recipient, identified woman Japan’s western region Kansai, recovering nearly 11-hour operation Wednesday, Kyoto University Hospital said statement. said husband son, donated parts lungs, also stable condition. Brazil huge. would also like see actual numbers article. exactly mean ""more young adults""? wish ask questions media consistently sensationalist this. example, proportion shifting? Say 20% young adults last December 30% now, overall number dropped 80%. ""more young adults hospitalized""? would pretty clearly vaccine keeping huge percentage old adults safe, single-handedly warping ratio people hospital even external changes whatsoever (such effect variant, suggested article). let us I’m still allow this? Supposedly mean maybe. means probably too, man, effects except headache. long term symptoms started clearing two weeks first dose moderna. Anecdotal course, relief crazy quick went recieving vaccines vaccinating vulnerable. mean, parents even getting vaccinated long after. expect come around quickly. hope US start exporting vaccines soon. Pfizer Moderna think made US EU rest world relying supply EU US wont export theirs. Buying finished product much different sinking money development something might work not. EU risked 2.7 billions development!

And yes, want buy hundreds millions doses, even AZ. fault bunch incompetent twats unable keep even 1 promise production targets. ""Buying"" means pay something. AZ can't delivee save lives. yah cases really high across nation today, hoping could keep deaths 1k thats looking dicey mean even so, they’re still vaccinating 50 year olds areas first shot need 3 weeks get decent level immunity, taking us mid May. It’s honestly deep. 

Also, mean randomly decide it’s already month long based emotions, doesn’t mean government sudden abandon plans. give us break stop complaining &amp; wait weeks. It’s already hard enough live pandemic, don’t need low quality uncreative yapping make even harder. you’re struggling find dose, FEMA site Yakima, WA open ages tons available capacity. way works. Oxford get credit name dropped AZ vaccine. people care really, noone give rat's ass Pfizer Biontech year two. think/hope lot people say going wait Kids vaccinated view differently clear case numbers especially death numbers falling cliff. turns EU tax payers ones morals then? Pfizer would skip clinical trials could ready well. think vaccine April May (the mRNA researched cancer treatment decades now, place coronavirus mRNA lipids delivering it). hope start using cloth bags grocery store soon. Fair Park Texas Motor Speedway like apparently Taiwan use hotel quarantine, use electronic monitoring home. Really country using hotel quarantine like NZ Australia. 

The issue capacity, hundreds available spaces hotels actually closing number border Australia becoming quarantine-free 10 days. 

We limit number spaces limit risk positive cases getting in. averaged 1 2 positive cases day, hotel quarantine failure every 3 weeks Covid entered community needed contained contact tracing. Twice failed lockdown again. 

Now getting 10 positive cases day India alone several times last weeks. 2 quarantine failures worker infected last 2 weeks. level risk become unmanageable flights stopped. Ground - low risk
Air - high risk

Amazing it’s taken whole year work one /s Thanks. want say I’m experiencing symptoms. I’ve mild headache day morning throat little scratchy. 2 years ago wouldn’t think twice assume allergies get allergies time year. can’t help wonder symptoms. whole work gotten Pfizer (25+ employees) think one call series shots. Personally, side effects aside sore arm. 

The person know got Moderna bosses’ grandmother. doctor recommended due preexisting heart condition. Unfortunately adverse reaction required emergency open heart surgery month ago. got second operation morning good spirits. 

Fortunately disorder sort reaction common Economist ran pretty good article idea vaccine passports days weeks ago. Basically, useful limited amount time. vaccines widely available, they're obviously pointless. vaccines everywhere, they're likewise pointless (like Israel experiencing now). Basically time vaccine passports US right now, June they'll pointless.

Other countries might find useful future, though. freaking love people sub provide real sources Unless someone else lower risk. beginning pandemic realized much lazy fuck keep stopped. [Saw article today reminded last week, Pfizer announced vaccine far safe children ages 12 15, said plans seek emergency-use authorization age group “as soon possible.” Others follow. “For adolescents, vaccines probably available fall,” estimates Paul Spearman, director infectious-diseases division Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. “For younger kids, it’ll probably early 2022.” 15k per day Norway. take us 670 ish days vaccinate everyone. 1 dose plenty enough mortality, sure let's wait bit longer. like negative things lockdown cost us anything...

Look last year's trend June onwards, cases took months reached level November 3 5 adults already least 1 vaccine shot.

For one month longer, rather lockdown one months long already proposing wait 2 months long. Yeah, conduct clinical trial like 70 people? Putin take either.

Having different composition that's another interesting thing, might even getting something different tested.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* AZ still back mix? Rate start pick anyway. Also, don’t forget vast difference population. Wrong. sold PCs ago (it public boot).

But again, likely think genius saying ""Turd-ew"" first thing struck 112 still really nice hair???? Jealous genes Johnson&amp;Johnson one shot past Monday I'm pleased

It's bad, tried really know one tastes best. happy take back bad choice, I'd suggest reading Google reviews jumping in. 👏 interested whitelandia news received Tuesday soreness/discomfort injection site slight headache, really much anything else. couple people know around age (we're 28-33) slight fevers top well, nothing much lasted longer maybe night. Actually turned incorrect. correction article.

Deliveries get reduced, talked region (Flanders) around half country, assumed entire country. seemed like deliveries got cut half, never happenend nationwide.

On contrary, Janssen pulled first deliveries EU forward week. first batch arrive next week. certainly didn’t. Must whole parenting pandemic thing rough us. really failed children lack foresight here. unfortunately even can't make vaccines thin air. course jabs give would perfect start, know approach patients. Hopefully help people  got Moderna. sore arm days first shot essentially symptoms second Amazing! Norway administering 15k doses per day rate take 670 days everyone Norway immunized. Yup!

[Using data clinical trial limiting infections days 15-21, efficacy link also cites study Israel found 85% effectiveness first dose.

[Another study US found 80% effectiveness first dose starting 2 weeks  Surely point everyone knows bunch people who've recovered covid. So...have third experienced anything like above? Unless know unlucky group 80 year olds, I'm going guess no. ordered Russian Sputnik V cover issues Astra Zeneca, good job, went even less safer vaccine.

I believe whole AZ issue artificially inflated. UK seem problems somehow. think would want look worse report vaccinations regularly. people would lie vaccinated distancing masking anyway It’s joke decimal places Italy vaccinated (2 doses) 6% population. Asking questions like useless point. planning going anyways. many restrictions. Sounds lot like good job injecting vaccines. 

Presumably JNJ one actual material vs mRNAs it’s one dose. It’s possible nurse doctor kept hitting veins injecting place it’d taken quickly bloodstream injecting fast. sorts stuff. super concerning overall considering many one site ironically. teach world ""Limitations"" heading is, ""peer review"" means, publish studies open internet alongside reviewers' comments.

Oh, right: Elsevier. sarcasm. Even places ""did right"" normal summers [more deaths per capita United say hundreds thousands lives could saved ""did right"" two weeks victim-blaming nonsense.  gotta hope enough people around area get vaccinated. hopefully see safe effective, may change mind. Hope got promised 50 cents CCP comment. So...do think travel restrictions businesses shortly open up? Man, I’d happy even 1 2 days week remote. It’s much peaceful productive.

My employer thinks we’re children. It’s like don’t know people wasting work time _at work_. Doesn’t matter they’re home not. Meanwhile, us much productive happy less tired.

That booty's hot make drop... miss good office politics miss bad office politics.

good office politics like sharing teas, small talk, asking help giving help return, asking coworker know something.

bad office politics game gossip, getting interrupted, help someone ain't grateful assholes respect boundaries, game stealing credits, protect assholes, pretend know stuff actually know, programming department design department blaming blaming managers gets trouble.  now? remote call center work? wish option work home, go calls break downs get paid 8 hrs, that'd tits   Salad costs big mac It’s funny everyone know trying get J&amp;J shot freaks less since it’s mRNA vaccine. don’t want end hospital Covid I’d take whichever one get (and lazy part wishes got J&amp;J didn’t go back part 2). People stubborn. I’d concern Covid vaccine side effects I’m still fully remote since March 16, 2020. It’s unrealistic expectation think 100% remote forever counting employer introducing flexibility. company issued laptop docking station. coworkers took monitors home. would happily buy dock monitor pair given flexibility come office need access large workspaces person collaboration. need quiet, need isolation concentration, home given productive time finest work output basically ever. 

I really hope management recognizes this, think do. heard thru grapevine sick leave, unexpected vacation down, productivity output up.

Edit: stand corrected, apparently have. anything else wrong.

I could never million years asked option pre-COVID times. currently live, law mandates employers make ""reasonable"" accommodations disabilities, remote work considered reasonable—especially positions actively manage employees.

If roll back ""new norms,"" we'll go right back before. interview office everyone able-bodied working *in* office, idea hiring manager oversee department without ever actually visiting building seem ""not doable."" I'd odd one out.

Able-bodied people think old norm particularly notable, *see* disabled people missing offices. idea society invisibly constructed lock many people coworkers.

The second remote work goes back ""an exception extreme cases"" instead accepted norm, go back world disabled people second class citizens. world disclose disabilities, beg scrape accomodations, ultimately—quietly—be left out.

I fight tooth nail remote remain new norm. good able-bodied people well, makes society equitable. I'm going back way things before, equal among peers. Never. No. Full stop. Lockdowns work. Masks work. Full stop, again. Images

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Ignorance bliss :) פוג data stands right now, official recommendation generally believed safe pregnant women personal choice based preliminary data. testing EUA include pregnant women thus behind testing. also far higher bar testing comes use pregnancy. 

As stands, absolutely feel pregnancy would considered valid medical exemption getting vaccine. many people (like myself) would prefer wait data. asked examples valid medical exemptions given one.  Archive link: Looks like started vaccinating people who’ve start March, 90 days ago. backtracked hours ago says expects schools fully open back full capacity 2021-2022 year. 

So I'm sure exactly sure what's going CDC's public messaging right far I'm concerned people sick got shot last, I'm sure they've gotten yet. remember back got shot considerable amount peers previously sick told come back later date. blame them. leave comfort home get paid staying home working. 

Plus, TON people moving big cities countryside work remotely loving freedom leaving house whenever want. physically deal idiot co-workers daily. 

Also, they've spent major money remodeling country house stay home long periods time. required go back office...I'm sure 34% quit. say person anything walls. said offices worth trappings can't make friends outside it. friends want, want commute, stress, laundry, etc. make friend. would rather use avenues. people saying friends co workers problem. means never learned make friend without trappings forced proximity. problem idea people hybrid schedule rather stay home something appease group. 34 percent laziest people earth rather sit home absolutely nothing. asked 1000 people would rather welfare love government Read headline again. 

34% willing quit it. 

The remaining 66% probably includes good many want work home. going quit jobs forced go back office. I'm trying describe certain sort liberal. Maybe fashionably gay black friends get anxious around teenager baggy clothes chain minding business. Nope. remote 100% 5 years pandemic. hated there's much work home vice office. Prior COVID, commute anywhere 75 90 mins direction - either car combination bus train. colleagues similar one-way journey time ranging 45 mins 2.5 hours.

Going office also narrowed flexibility hours due traffic, timetables, congestion. Since WFH began, however, absolute flexibility hours. morning commute time gone directly towards extra sleep, afternoon commute time gone directly recreation, household duties, extra work time (which translates flex time use future reduced hours later week).

I start finish work later, time spend partner family, opportunity run errands housework relax/go across entire week - even go office week like 2020. mention, far productive home due fewer distractions.

It's hardly surprising many people similarly positive experiences WFH thus unwilling return full-time office. would utterly stupid workforce financial perspective employers maintain office leases force workers return old ways working. Change always coming, COVID expedited shift work, workers tolerate companies refuse adapt accept new reality. can't compare vaccines tested decades full FDA approval new vaccine fully approved.

Sure can. anything go SCOTUS I'd assume would rule vax. think many people never realized unfair spend additional 1-2 hours commuting work top 8 hours work, time counted work.
That insane amount day wasted - hell, hours sleeping 2/3 goddamn life!!! know. Back restrictions eased felt much like sitting finish line sight. Anyone could seen mile away. yeah ""they choice"" throw away years time money spent, hope credits transfer get vaccine fully tested/ approved FDA.

Seems like easy choice me, hey someone wants make wrong decision, go crazy. 7 day average deaths fell 1,000 week ago already 788 now, that's despite cases stable pretty high level around 6 weeks now. 

People still going hospital, fewer fewer dying. disease starting look lot like typical flu.  higher chance tripping bath cracking skull toilet may well buy ticket ""We're buying pizza today 'thank you'!"" No, buying pizzas people eat desks work lunch... Narrator, one month later: “they wanted jobs back” one stopping seen lots people talk wearing flu season. I'm like nope...I want live society masked faces super common. actually think masks detrimental mental health. Humans social creatures. need see faces. go back work, wear shirt made leaves shout “WHAT YEAR IT?” everyone. Even bananas? They'll brown time ""quarantine""  Teacher also. We’ve person since start year, feel like year kiddos especially hard engage. don’t know 6 months “no school” played role, masking lack shared facial expression blame...? know felt like finally reeling in, we’re 4th quarter weathers getting nice. say year is, “I tried”  world finds grateful purported benevolence China, distributing less effective vaccines getting good PR it? Yes, makes America stand particularly bad. think overcome this, it’s going take lot work I'm sure 100% thinking way pandemic   I’m exact boat. could go socialize freely work I’d 100% work home forever I’m vaccinated despite hella young ill-conceived policies, I’m quite happy that. I’m definitely blaming people. I’m blaming leaders. People bitched initial vaccine rules stupid arbitrary. one Governor relaxed rules, rest governors jumped proposing earlier earlier dates full eligibility. could’ve track double digit deaths May, probably whole country would opened up. 

Instead still listen doom predictions every public health figure doesn’t want time spotlight grannies still dying getting hospitalized alarming rates. alarming enough compel anyone fix apparently, alarming nonetheless. keep used justification maintain restrictions people, restrictions keep sandbagging economy collective moods. It’s shit deal everyone involved regardless age occupation. I’m surprised people aren’t bewildered it.

Like WFH, coworker calls directly chat, im still working stuff, sending emails, typing reports, entering data updating case files. great can't see me.

Also, recently given responsibility regard special projects, quiet workspace focus really way possible handle additional workload. 

I time everyday WFH, compared occasional tardiness office work, and, called 1 single day since WFH, which, going office, would panic attacks end calling 1 2 days month.

Find another job supposed feel sad? That’s fine, don’t surprised countries (especially allies) return favor look first future.

Vaccine hoarding one thing, especially US export ban materials disrupts supply chains doesn’t play well rest world. exact thought. must want everyone busy hanging friends fucking Tinder randoms even notice recall election. little cross travel, seems obvious whole area increases despite restrictions...every time bring seasonality post gets deleted I’ll let ppl think one Isn’t company produces anthrax vaccine US military terrible quality control may caused Gulf War Syndrome? Though looks like Japan got AZ doses US factories requires restraint addition vaccines may while. Congratulations able reach herd immunity 2 month head us 4x per capita cases 3x per capita deaths. done, send vaccines pls, thx. Trump waited local transmission throughout US Hubei already locked down. also didn’t affect travelers require quarantine numerous exceptions ... Canada, least. Pandemic endless lockdowns made us lazy  support people working home, especially productive employees, imo vast overgeneralization. management job much harder people working home. sorts additional tasks related OH&amp;S, ensuring people aware corporate shifts changes priorities, right tools job (electronic devices, access printers, etc.), onboarding new employees, overseeing performance, many addressed automatically existing systems controlled office environment. Now, need whole heck lot due diligence individual manager accomplish result. great team highly skilled productive employees, new tasks still need done me, top already waaaay heavy work load. working home becomes norm, standard practices need change, may put burden individual employee. Thank goodness team lazy misfits life would 🤬. Might stupid question got second moderna shot today felt symptoms (didn't feel much first time either) soreness injection site, potentially sign immune system really learning fight COVID (so may immune)? I'm young (early 20s) heard side effects much harder younger people immune systems kick harder, I'm worried shot really working Come what's different Yeah school requires show proof certain vaccinations start classes general coronavirus wouldn’t different proving you’re vaccinated things like rubella meningitis. It’s literally one shot that’s required attend classes campus schools legally allowed require current college student I’m happy means get back normal lives without worry dumb fuck deciding don’t want get vaccinated yet still live campus dorm communal bathrooms shared like 50 people. yeah safety reasons they’re requiring everyone coronavirus vaccine start classes makes sense. imagination running wild.


No one proposing tying covid vaccines grocery checkouts.

Not one person, strawman idea? ask last employer would let stay remote denied you? Even 10 years?? think that’s what’s going happen me. hope gave severance doesn’t sound like it. I'll show vaccination card. Hell, let states tie driver's license. They'd one actually data/records anyways. many hands many privacy implications. need third fourth parties work. I'm hope others see numerous pitfalls could bring. 

I'll live like covid19 longer. I've done long, I'll more. think there’s cases vaccinated people dying since rollout began, seem old/ill people weak immune systems. That’s unexpected, though. Sounds like vaccine really want.....All clinically trialed like 6 months. usually many handful years. hesitation lot people. Why?

Who cares. vital vaccine passports?  encourage people get vaccine.

If choose getting vaccine getting vaccine passport banning vaccine passports easy answer get vaccine (and passport). old adage: want something done, find busiest person give them. I'm sure, might worded them. instance, imagine asked ""be willing return office"" ""would like return office. course want answer ""would willing return office"", choice way ""would like return office"" option provided you. able applying work stealing rest.

unemployment fund pay work. Nobody ""stealing"" anything. getting paid *back.* I’m American visited Canada many times. nice place, nice people. Beautiful country. it’s expensive place live compared US aren’t many jobs. think buying house US expensive, wait see much house costs Canada. Major yikeroonies. Also really okay shitty weather.

My point it’s nice place without downsides.    Wow, Germany average 18 days year per Person. Either live unhealthier lazier ppl Denmark 😅 said prediction Easter 2021 totally unrealistic herd immunity. right, even vaccinations started. made predictions, mentioned dates.

The ""optimistic timeline"" quoted written someone else, me. unemployment paying better lot jobs.

A roundabout way saying many jobs paying enough. Toronto would third line biggest cities US Canada. mean relative US still better expect change next week so. comment here. worked company till 2013 moved remote work office space #2 cost. Also found significant boost worker productivity.

Got new job 2013. 100% office exceptions. 2020 happens productivity goes plus need save money. announced would close physical sites keep people home meet goal. 7 years showed numbers move. one pandemic suddenly see light. ""Emergent forced discard Johnson &amp; Johnson doses checks revealed contamination virus used production AstraZeneca vaccine. investigation underway, federal former company officials suspect lot tainted employee moved AstraZeneca’s section plant Johnson &amp; Johnson’s without showering taking precautions."" reason error cross contamination. Sure enough. There's already start going week. hate it. I’m talkative person mood right working home last year resentful go back in. get pulled office asked everything okay I’m ‘my usual self’. think don’t want office I’m allowed quiet want be. don’t want go work socialize. I’m 61 never rough experience second dose moderna, saved worries knew getting money’s worth. odd part runny nose cough. professional worklife since 1997, always company paid internet connection. Dial-in, isdn, 10/2 mbps adsl 40/20 mbps adsl replaced 1Gbps fiber sooner later.

Internet access essential part infrastructure companies need realize that. I’m surprised shell yourself, able work. pay computer too? populist gamble vaccinations happen quick enough make look like total buffoons. article says comes true, still get mRNA vaccine point.

If youre keen getting one, keep eye studies safety efficacy getting additional covid vaccine ""boosters"" different manufacturers. What's point saying vaccine passports today? nice must kill millions around world live consequences yourself. contain virus covered could stopped begin like saying I'm abusive person verbally abuse u slap. What’s going 52% population fully vaccinated + 15% convalescent. Together results 67% population kind immunity 

What showing however don’t need something crazy like 95% vaccine uptake make huge impact pandemic particular country like postulated. Even 50% population vaccinated makes massive difference 

As you’re saying, yes lower efficacy vaccine people need vaccinate achieve herd immunity. Meaning need vaccinate comparatively less people 95% vaccine versus 65% vaccine Things starting open already. 

Six flags open. Disneyland open. Etc.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Seems like it’s going come late. Would cool ready sale last summer. Many wifes coworkers same. way relieve stress, believe safer way, it. I'd willing bet large part us 40 hours work week often made 30ish hour work week, working home means actually beneficial extra hours actually used rather wasted work. top saves commute time gas money. first shots far date given 3 month delay second shots az, yet numbers second shots given, early tell sure. Well doctor pretty misinformed id insist cardio referral someone experience POTS. Yes sodium hydration suggested POTS patients absolutely isn’t treatment. I’m low dose beta blocker control tachycardia anyone extreme tachycardia, that’s instant quality life change. Maybe tachycardia isn’t extreme didn’t think beta blocker indicated there’s still lot resources referred diagnosis. cardiologist offered refer dietician I’ve seen physical therapist exercise regimen POTS. access resources someone explain geopolitics behind Isreal got first dibs lol Sorry forgot include source, 86% figure UAE study. study included 31,000 volunteers across 125 nationalities 

""The analysis also shows ""99% seroconversion rate neutralizing antibody 100% effectiveness preventing moderate severe cases disease"", ministry said statement carried state news agency"" necessarily?... say anything denying... weren't... yes, That's correct. Let's beat around bush. think apply domestic travel think taking away available give back carrot actually good thing? think skepticism would raised action? People know already know taken away. 

The interview 2018 like article discussing specifically covid. vaccines general. site heard search engine down. I'm trying find general search engines hear words press release addressing different deal. raw audio interview, article proving difficult search terms. best luck yet. 

I hope right grocery stores. could live minimal change life long never required there. Travel would tough change I've always wanted drive across country right mindset bad.

Unless find interview guess there's nothing else us. quit 1. Go Dubai, Maldives country require negative PCR test tourist visa.
2. Quarantine per stipulated period country.
3. Apply travel NZ country.

Many countries became transit place origin country travel bans since last year especially Dubai. many countries started banning travelers UK, 14 day stay Dubai Negative PCR tests.  time zone difference big deal. causes things solved minutes take days question takes day answer. Also meetings inconvenient everyone. work positions, great collaborate. Hello I'm looking information regarding sinusthrombosis vaccination Astrazeneca. searchfunction threads? 
Anyway , want know, cases sinusthrombosis occur? first second shot?
I can't find information it! somebody help me?  Id rather drop keep college online Yeah wait EMA approval? give approval? EMA takes time. work corporate services one 10 largest insurance brokerages US. Insurance wise, sounds like might become costly people put office risk claims related covid lot corporate liability plans going start excluding covid like exclude terrorism mass shooting incidents. insurance means higher overhead really hope corporations consider even selfish reasons.

So get someone saying saying this. think lacks understanding things probably going. decent chance Covid becomes like flu people vaccinated and/or caught least once. New variants could occur rough also happens flu - remember swine flu 08 (or maybe 09)? one gets sued flu spreading office, even nasty year. likely future, people sued COVID spreading. 

Maybe misunderstand mean excluding doubt see lawsuits covid spreading.

Now pandemic insurance already largely included many people going lawsuits debate force majeure clauses cover not. add specific note future contracts force majeure include pandemics, legally allowed. really impact office buildings workers work home. companies paid employees livable wage im sure people would work dont. Fucking shitbags wanna keep struggling life support. Fuck system.  crazy much housing varies places place. garage 815 square feet. denial gets thicker everyday. variants get squashed Pfizer Israel uses lol. What’s next excuse? still takes 1-3 business days. banks credit unions release funds typically 500-1000$ know check clears good faith anything 1k-5k typically 1-3 business days stuff 5k usually 7-10 business days. Source: work finance pay! always goes. reward good efficient work additional work.

According BLS majority 8 hour per day jobs involve 3 hours actual productive work per day. won’t speculate much intentionally wasted. imagine employees simply don’t realize much time waste day irrelevant things.

Smart lazy employees realize purposely underperform avoid burnout.

At old office job would usually get days worth work done noon spend rest day looking busy. making much progress project would purposely slow work pace avoid finishing anything early.

Why? learned hard way first week dumb ambitious. finished weeks worth work 2 days working hard distractions. reward tripling workload tyrannical manager expectation would get every project done similar timelines, even unfeasibly large ones. Meanwhile co workers worked snail’s pace nobody gave grief it. while, I’m paid $10 per hour less them. 

So decided fuck it, didn’t really like job coworkers, didn’t give shit company well not, throttled work output match co workers. kill working literally value labor going boss’s pocket get nothing? Sure got grief management first, days stopped bitching quality work still better peers. kept that, working 9-12 listening music playing phone/computer games lunch left day year. got accepted medical school quit job next day old boss gave great exit interview saying great worker work high quality timely. Apart reported benefits productivity working home also gives people free time (less travelling) bet large reduction pollution, traffic vehicle maintenance too. example. Gotta send infected old people back care homes, get little brother hype prime time every night height fear, write book nailing response one highest fatalities per capita country world.  workaround start fun stuff early 😉 Shitty minimum wage worker here. 

I’ll take job. Lol youre lucky. live outskirts London (still city mind you) commute central London via one train tube like lot do, paying £200/m tickets, parking.

Never today 100% confident vaccines. believe risks, 100% believed benefits outweigh risks. 

This new information *should* knock confidence though I'm interpreting correctly, 20-something?  OK then, quit. Nobody begging come back. #ធ្វើរឿងល្អថ្ងៃនេះ = #DoSomethingGoodToday (in Khmer) That’s exactly plan Covid over. work home days, go week stack day coffee catch ups, meeting work friends, going happy hour. Lol also remember people saying 'The U.S. take 5 years vaccinate everyone rate' like two days vaccination effort. I'm age you. Got second dose two weeks ago. bad, really paid attention feeling I'd get close puking. kept busy mostly notice. thing happened friend brothers. Biden, course. ^^/s also giving vaccine people another country? tourists Strap kids in, give 'em little bit vodka

In cherry coke, we're going Oklahoma That’s exactly plan right according head dept. company wasn’t releasing back office information. It’s full year, haven’t come new policy announced new working styles they’ll likely go back old normal. Ok then. Can't use vaccine outside US? got this. FEMA, need help Border Patrol. going need 2 mile long loop Canadian Mexico borders. Bring checkpoint, jab way in. Stay cars people, drive curve U. take 15 min get there. medic check adverse reaction, give vac card. problems, drive U, back country. Heck, bring greyhound bus, send tech board. this. 

Mission accomplished. hate shit much think precautions really colleges, team sports. Extra curricular open. stores also packed. get lot sleep without shower commute 90% people southern california city wear masks walking, running, biking alone. in-laws drove visit went walk come back minutes later grab masks said felt uncomfortable ones without masks walking alone neighborhood.  crazy. definitely approved fall though. they’d really need one approved effectively mandate since they’d likely give exceptions people gotten another type vaccine Unfortunately people realize ever watched FOXNEWS primetime talk COVID/Vaccines? largest TV news viewership USA. Wish could get paid work comfort home. vehicles fix themselves, can't turn wrench hundreds miles away comfort computer...and guys often get paid waaaay higher do. fucked world live in. Though appreciate people road longer contributing traffic... don’t want learn Spanish 400 people Kansas City vaccinated popular tavern Waldo district yesterday. Missouri open people Friday serious problems filling slots right now. fact today social media reading local HyVee grocery store nurse standing outside pharmacy offering anyone wanted Covid shots filled 50% appointments. fully vaccinated. long quarantine traveling? reading CDC website bunch studies, end says avoiding work social disruptions may outweigh risks. 

wtf CDC 

I work home. probably live close workplace says ""remote workers"" they're WORKING home, ""doing absolutely nothing"". Even working remotely still responsible getting stuff done. actually nothing they'd already fired. sounds like coworkers adding value people outside immediate chain command, improving overall output company.

Those types things let people outside immediate manager know do, value add. That's learn business operates, enable grow within company.  still see everyone wearing masks they're supposed to. biggest difference I've noticed 1. Stores pretty packed. 2. lot house parties. 3. Bars pretty busy too. 4. Team sports, colleges, schools reopened busy like usual. 5. People covid skeptics basically gave public. friend 3 kids extra curricular, kids house every day, friend coming over, etc.

If we're getting hit heavy variant, could see things would spreading.

But again, everyone wears masks they're supposed to. Most/all private schools, notably. 
 
I also find kind bizarre require vaccination disease close zero percent mortality rate college students - especially considering vulnerable people could spread would already vaccinated. 
 
Should take vaccine? Yes. schools wrong authoritarian. Yeah! people get right 9 leave 5. pulling load bit bet, probably work 2 hours day I’m boat! company tried get us back November without warning plan. didn’t go due rise cases. knew would eventually bring us back full time started applying started new remote job week! hope pressure influences employers offer hybrid/remote roles feasible 👍 I’m necessarily replying much anyone reading this, people could carry sort medical papers (medical problems, medications allergies) somewhere person, say places least make attempt find them. problem people medical conditions screwed aren’t conscious don’t. I'm sure know how. 

But US plant produces plasmids 15 (!) times larger Marburg plant. able something different able massive scale.  keep jabbing people try understand (I agree you) important questions? USAA definitely 2009. government ignored it.  LA County, dining linked [4% using Health Departments data likely entirely indoor dining made 4%.  Regardless data, hands, shut outdoor dining last lockdown. California restaurant association sued county demanding see data supported lockdown judge [ruled county admitted any. rather 50 hours work enjoy time well? 

I get ""work live"" thing. costs extra hour day work get know people work with, take genuine interest lives, absolutely best thing do. Makes entire experience much enjoyable every single day. place spend most, second time at. might well enjoy it.  mean able make judgment based numbers apparently Japan good job getting data hospitals filled covid patients hospital workers saying. 34% likey least useful employees companies anyway. I’m pro vaccine. said, institutions cannot legally require someone get vaccine isn’t FDA approved. military can’t even mandate yet university holding making mandatory reason. pandemic changed way work year. Majority companies said production good, matter fact production rate high compared year. yes would prefer working home less stressed productive. It’s win employees company ( that’s opinion). regards long covid transmission, risks ""don't"" factor ""can't"", data available? many women even pregnant ever children. I'm sure people losing jobs outsourcing think way. mean, everything right working. remember province adding single-digit cases day trending zero, people got cocky. heard vaccine coming people decided pandemic over. 

I kept saying it’s little early pat back yet, god wish I’d wrong. Variants combined COVID fatigue conspiracy idiots spreading bullshit sudden weeds. we’re adding ~1000 cases every day signs slowing down. joke I’m happy gives little pop reminder always forget. many people fail realize. common response well work speak itself

Ya, well doesn't. Welcome real world! know important. think part wake really tired (no matter go bed) can't caffeine medication I'm :/ used use caffeine help focus. make hyper energized like focus juice get it. Fucking 4 day work week. Let's go. another job waiting pandemic delayed. can’t wait start, it’s dream career. need make money meantime haven’t left current job yet. ask come back office fucking quit tomorrow. I’m seeing Biden deliberately mixed wrong ingredients, dastardly smile /s

You’re right—the federal bureaucracy lot execution policy famous face does. 296 cases whole country. Wow Last year kid upload vaccine record enrolling college. Come think it, also provide shots beginning primary school. And, also provide shot record summer camp. Yea, proof vaccination thing while. Yeah, clear, comparing abstinence sex ed make abundantly clear science based. Instead flouting science attempt control behavior. problem many California's restrictions principle, Newsom lost support pointless restrictions French Laundry. think people like commuting excessive amounts time. People want waste 2 hrs day helping lives out. lockdown height vaccinations too. isreal able fend 3rd wave amount vaccines had, I'm sure there's much hope country really strict measures place covid zero. People waste much time work, ridiculous.

And probably guy office sits desk alone day headphones in, eats lunch desk goes home without saying word. 

A lot people genuinely like people work with, enjoy human interaction. people thing like every job I've had. 

If job 100% transactional, understand it, anyone working form project/program/people management, social interaction huge part job, build relationships help develop progress.  teams :) sides politicized pandemic greatly. left overhypes COVID, support indefinite lockdowns, completely throwing mental health economy wind. right downplays it, creates skepticism proven, low-cost measures masks vaccines. saddened could come together make solution effective sustainable.

Polio syphilis, example, existed far longer human recorded history Ebola, neither ever mutated way changed mode transmission. What’s Brazil variant (p1) vaccines? much misinformation twitter. reliable info effective vaccines variant ?? White collar world lucked out. Must nice 

The rest us Blue Collar land got fucked.

Me everyone house worked start pandemic (trains, busses, dealing public) 

I'm NY, esSenTiAl (minimum wage) point. Drunk driving still illegal, folks still infect others. genocide deliberate. doesn’t apply here. It’s shit leadership. Don’t forget weekly journal Can't wait till we're nightclubs open already 858 vaccinated people? Hey trial buddies! I’m also mRNA 1273 study. Remember EU crying Trump would ...

&amp;#x200B;

Oh turn tables  never got seniority logic. better something someone else, deserve raise. man, Never canada we’ll see later year :/ sounds like reasonable approach. Training particular seems like kind thing that'd much better person, depending job course. work issue me, 3 hour commute cannot tolerate further. matter salary.   checks out. Galaxy S2 launched like 2010. one people. Thought going back office 9-5 depressing left job new one big factor wanting waste hour half day driving office, found job two block away instead. Life short already spend 8 hours office Yeah, MIL well.. she’s 55 wants another kid? cause infertility. 😐 Ach must talking July 2022 then. similar life lockdown.

I look back realise sad every day. time couldn’t work would often blame things/people closest :( 
It’s obvious looking back! agree 100%, kids locked Lol pay bills  hate kids people's kids.

However, 3 year old old enough school made challenging get work done day.

I guess I'm one excited get back office.

If kids school age would different story? Probably. time zone still important. competition won’t point people asking significantly less. are, bit red flag. Plus offer would usually extended prior pay negotiations staying within budgets range rather getting cheapest candidate possible, varies depending company position. Hiring candidate cheap might also mean they’re likely jump ship earlier.

For minor changes, comes cost well. It’s intrusive workflow people asking. Sure might one small thing imagine many small things could asked people. employee, stop focused on, switch gears task go back possibly take moment remind at. company expectation quickly respond messinging service employees provide contacts calls something urgent, limits convenience able bother employee task. Response time issues get resolved also acts filter reach necessary. company issues response time expected employees timely responding calling last resort gets peoples attention. Even office, there’s limit far Im going walk would call first anyways.

There’s pros cons saying, believe job fits WFH mold, currently proven work fine, taking away detrimental employees really wanted it. employers would offer perk would draw candidates away companies don’t offer it. I’ve seen threads think I’m one seems working twice hard home. hate complete lack work/life separation moment can’t wait go back. work 2 days home 3 days office though much better balance full time either way. physical location issue, thats recommended taking laptop Starbucks something. go office

a lot us option. work sensitive client information can't work public area. time HR allowing anyone work office de facto enforcement even ACLU objects normalizing intrusive digital vax passes. need paper check rent payments landlord. management companies large complexes wire transfer/ACH method nominal fee, I’ve largely ever needed reorder checks pay rent thus far. think impact also get better job options, typically, people gain seniority clarity enjoy/tolerate many reach job happy longer either way. hopped lot short period first 3 jobs can't imagine leaving. kid I'm sure I'd less likely move something small I'm also seniority get autonomy work, past roles. That's nice approach it, though still feels weird seem intent letting citizens chose directly.

Thanks answering. get back it. Like everything, practise practise ""how school"" again. Unionize. work load decrease, pay increase.

The reason job nightmare (and others like you) continue door mat.

Unionize. 4 days feel completely normal me. Took I've also likely Covid I've heard vaccine hits harder people who've it. I’m opposite. kids I’m loving extra time get them. understand people different situations, needing break would difficult get things done didn’t private room work in. covid would leave house would wake get home around 2-3 hours bedtime, precious hours basically filled dinner bedtime prep. killed kids growing eyes barely got see everyday. never want go back again. know keep downvoted say true, guess people feel job parents get kids motivated good school student unlucky got shitty parent oh well bad get left behind rest world moves on. I'm essential worker who's working throughout pandemic work place dealing lot hands work

I'd anything office gig office. underwent clinical trials US pending approval, unless find abundance evidence vaccine harmful COVID get approved even exceeding rare occurrence blood clots. guess dragging feet actually use vaccine, eventually approved late roll out. almost like spending year work remote work makes people realize 40 plus hour work week intense utter bullshit.

 get wrong I'm 4 day work week 10 hour shifts make extra day think countries do.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

People live perfectly spread-out. Population-weighted density takes consideration, used epidemiology. *You* mistaken. anyone tell symptoms blood clots linked AstraZeneca Vaccine? use idiotic analogy - bandage/compress temporary measure wound treated cannot kept place due lack another solution Thank you! “looking new job” different “quitting”! Maybe it’s I’m new full time working small company, ever done work? 

Do deliverables nobody tracking do?

We twice daily calls work monitor progress fill timesheets, can’t really slack off. Even I’m done routine tasks, to-do list several weeks work Yes stories Michigan patients hospital younger winter. old people protected - 3/4 least 1 shot - fewer deaths younger people die high rate older people. Never mind built nice work space home, enjoy WAY get work. get use desktop PC 3 monitors 90% need do, slow ass company laptop rest. MUCH fun work way! Well, right AZ suspended 55 years age atm. say take first vaccine offered you, deny one would given go check back later time one want want go back environment work home. 1.5 years couch laptop really mess back up.

If place work home though, I'd rather it. hate wasting half day making polite small talk people arent busy/ want work I'm busy. Despite redditors saying parents hate kids, people live postage stamp, psychopaths, etc. us work focus better space designated work. hard time focusing distractions home. work problem.

Also, there's clear drop productivity coworkers too, severe others. management seems pretty oblivious worst offenders are, puts lot burden us trying hold things together. quarter time message someone discuss something get reply. Either they're ducking responsibility they're even desk. Things much easier smoother everyone place. I'm sure varies lot depending industry though. 479.00 USD. rounded up. expect large increases near future one riding trains transit authority flat broke.

They financial trouble covid. That's cheap compared NYC different. Flu doesn’t leave otherwise healthy people long term asthma  fans attend games go socialize bars

wait, guys close bars? There’s nothing magical happens 18th birthday make vaccine safe. It’s tested 18 year olds, almost certainly must safe 17-year-olds too. 34% going change mind check job market. generally irrelevant deductions.

Stay safe bro Ugh know. got shot yesterday want put bubble couple weeks. Yesterday's cases actually slightly previous Tuesday hoping backlog slowdown reporting/testing holiday weekend. Please let us peak already. behold

\*lo behold boss full time remote 7 years I've office. kinda flipped that. Would interesting impact promotions.  hate traffic returned back pre covid. Nothing learnt. Remember, covid able get human interaction (outside work). throwing two cents check thread every day comment, end leaving thread reason, let us know? Thanks! It’s worked well France like 4 times Yeah, we'd need know case dose totals. Surely numbers must available somewhere? UK 48% 1+ shots 8% 2+ shots (6:1 ratio). comparison France 14% 1+ shots 4.7% 2+ shots (3:1 ratio still far first doses). That's combined vaccines though. I’m complete opposite. I’d rather get hired stay home day.

How’s perspective? federal policy UK applies banks? 
As far back 5 years ago able cash checks CitiBanks mobile app immediate funds States. mean like thinking real level it'd obvious true. USA country really obvious interest keeping people fertile healthy. want US population drop drastically 50 years real concern problem allowed taken. Less people means less GDP, less soldiers, less power. ones interest make kids infertile. kinda same, im vaccine ill get dose two week still dont like feels like bit reach. ironic considering came from. better productivity, workplace morale, etc etc lot better parent (okay- barring Covid related school home). little bit flexibility picking kids up, medical appts, etc important.  Okay well sounds like mad united states constitution anything vaccine haha Rutgers mandating would wager pretty good legal team worked issue explicitly found opposite true That's great, good you. Interesting fact, since mentioned it: company announced sick leave requests dropped 90%. 

Also, clarify older coworkers, 50s 60s (close retirement), get saying. company monthly surveys people wanted do. results always 90% work home, 5% hybrid, 5% work office. results change stopped monthly surveys :P opinion many epidemiologists studied data. many countries well (delaying 2nd shot get 1st shots populace)

The reason set 2nd appointment set 2nd appointment ...you still need 2nd shot optimal protection, however like vaccine stops working booster week, weeks matter. minority say really enjoyed coming back office? worked home 9 months going insane. enjoy getting somewhere go, brought anxiety. Also, people office socially distanced, wear masks, least half still working home. Also people keep mind participants going business mostly unvaccinated population. people get vaccinated, less less risk vaccinated person. Lol. realize urgent need vaccines caused Trump's non-existent pandemic response? dealt first heard rather calling hoax would've saved hundreds thousands lives. Russias vaccine numbers terrible. real death toll. Meanwhile they're dishing vaccines like candy foreigners.

That Mr Putin sure generous. Holy hell math till now, right... 10 days life back... Like actual full 24 hour 10 days life! vaccines even FDA approved yet. Also even ACLU qualms civil liberties issues digital vax pass. Absolutely - completely agree. 

I feel problem current approach education - borrow vegetable analogy - like holding child's head forcing veg whilst shouting ""candy real!"", instead trying approach acknowledges candy exists, tries find vegetables child might enjoy eating.

This scenario close heart I'm currently introducing child food, dealing challenges healthy food sometimes tasting little bland. :)

There relevant TED talk Sir Ken Robinson sums feelings would encourage watch.

I agree difficult problem, think important fix even so. . I'm sure waiting fully vaccinated population Pfizer, Moderna, JJ, authorize donate doses globally. 

If fully vaccinated population zero reason emergency approve AZ. doubt could find single person would get vaccinated there's free beer it.

My dad, quite reverse. Well honnesty seen shit happen large corporations too. least codified rules. Yes, seems like colleges may fall. Seems quite right though. May private colleges something like that, think state colleges require anything fully approved yet. pro vaccine, course, actually _require_ something stretch. Especially considering young people tiny risk. Please suspend entirely vaccine asap, going generate controversy forever erode confidence vaccines here, anti vaxxers trendy right now.

AstraZeneca suspended asap. Im glad got army 1 month shit kicked off. cant imagine fuck fuck games SMs deal with, especially early days. friends still told lot didnt change. 

my enlisted ass would bitching non stop formations large, group training/events. 

My last unit worked entirely DOD agency couldnt job werent physically office, work home wasnt option. 


I know everything would need carry usual, except everything annoying do. I'd love hear someone still in, esp army marines, unit handled pandemic. great hear someone IET must fucking sucked. Lol, comments like keep asking I'm really lucky totally delusional. work small (~15 employees) non-profit that's genuinely pretty cool place. basically get government money help poor people community, mainly helping get work. office building converted old villa pool table bar basement. work covid apparently used get quite bit use. used go Friday beers month boss would everyone house BBQ drinks. Apparently back 70s place opened employees used drugs together basement.

Anyway, I've always felt way feel work friendships. double crossed people thought friends stuff. people I'm now...if turns real friends think I'll ever trust anyone again, including personal life. I'd take bullet people. yeah...I miss WFH.

(Still team hybrid working arrangement though. Takes lot make completely forget commute + wearing PJs every day.) team made 150k one week denied raise. next week told take easy mad 50k. Got asked performance dropped told theyre working hard get paid. ... 66% wants return? know surprising. can't put reference... Yeah can, might suddenly realize bloat that’s taken residence people measured output butt seat. thought bad, 1 hour commute way every day, (free) company bus. ""Chills"" bit understatement. I'm 31 I've never chills like night 2nd pfizer shot. felt like going hurt violently body shaking. sick since kid.

I bed 8 hours shot 48 hours shot. miserable.

On plus side lick countertop local dive bar fine. Mostly fine. Yeah too, sure. they’re outlet helps us, think. There's 4 day grace period, one receive second dose 4 days early.

Thanks, I’ve looked symptoms CVST migraine. suffer chronic migraines, 15 plus days month. don’t think could take AZ vaccine would know adverse effect another migraine? read excess deaths something like 350k Russia? home working full time? 
I’ve worked onsite except working remotely week. people haven’t seen year working home. circle incompetent workers because, often not, you’re don’t worry getting laid off, stop giving fuck well job. universally true, close enough Reddit reality. RemindMe! 3 months feel man, that’s exactly felt first month wfh pandemic started . Create routine yourself. example still start day actually go office. Shower, get ready (whatever find comfortable ), make coffee , start workday. Take break, maybe light exercise break. work go get sun chill hobbies. 

Hopefully we’ll come end soon, won’t need put longer . hope too! 6 hours later luckily don’t fever headache remains. Totally wasn’t expecting reaction. ""low side effects say"", everyone know side effects vaccine.

I imagine mean low side effects ... *of death* lot pre-COVID involved screening/interviewing entry level applicants they've always like this.

Businesses noticing they're hiring focusing recruitment. second dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines administered close recommended interval possible, earlier recommended (i.e., 3 weeks \[Pfizer-BioNTech\] 1 month \[Moderna\]). **However, second doses administered within grace period 4 days earlier recommended date second dose still considered valid.""**

You're good within 4 days grace period. 

**Source:** want full return I’m productive without distractions within walking distance. Wait months sell back ronald mcdonald insane profits.

Would rather terrible disease drink Coors? 16 days.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

I’m accounting. submitted 68 applications two month period, interviews 6 companies offered job. There’s lot competition remote positions. sounds infuriating. mess, I'm Spanish suspended less 60 years...

I'm 29 got first dose I'm starting feel tired think want anything injected all...

They running ""trials"" mixing vaccines, yeah safe trials safety AZ vaccine...  Natural infection helps too. Memory cells going key. Humans survived pandemics thousands years without vaccines. No. Moderna didn’t test vaccine teenagers like Pfizer did, can’t say sure it’s safe not, there’s reason think it’s unsafe.  juicy coworkers gossip screwing watch messes implode real time, I’d much rather WFH. productivity, numbers overall work related stress decreased everyone sent home.  Crying healthcare. wish work home nurse zoom call patients remind turn. think lot people checked out. company losing multiple people week quitting including eventually tables turn how. really miss part-time job, even paid like shit, watch spending, free time invaluable. *Not doctor, Medical advice. 

Personally, would worry go ahead second jab like 18. 

It's nearly 100% chance safe effective going make people vax site weird tell them.

Pfizer safe 12 year old likely similar Moderna OK, milder side effects seems. I'm skilled trade, rates part standardized across industries. standard rate today started trade 10 years ago. I'm always advancing education I'm always (literally every day) searching higher paid jobs, employers industry decide budge, employer's market, really matter pulling bootstraps. 

I know people reluctant ever say there's greater problem here, always people lazy. Consider fact parents grandparents generation able buy house, car raise kids single middle class income. Currently people age struggle afford house kids dual income. kids question many people age reflected birth rate home ownership statistics. 

The cost education increased massively, wages stagnant since 1980. really believe matter pulling ole bootstraps?

If Working home cool get feeling giant companies going want people back offices pay rent on. F yeah recall, trials kids 12+ 3 approved vaccines right now, results come june approval potentially happening late fall

another source looked say: ""But Conway says expects ready adolescents aged 12 16 summer, five- 11-year-olds early 2022, babies toddlers sometime that. Maldonado hopes vaccine youngest group also available early 2022."" 16+ population would also total people lining get shots! Anti vaccine crowd usually lefties come on, know rich white old guys already taking money. 100% time could spending hours home wife sharing laughter happiness. 

I'm never going back commutes soulless cubicles received J&amp;J vaccine yesterday. Felt effects around 12 hours starting feel better now. tired people know taking thing seriously wearing mask around me. What's name company creating lockboxes using? closer 30% last election 26% 2016, nearly 40% eligible voters cast vote 45% people bother vote. Channel inner Katy Perry. “Infect lovin, fill poison...” email back.

""The thing I'll coming office hand two weeks notice, either keep quit"" Yep confirm already looking something permanent WFH rather go back office August/September told people start coming back.

Even funny company biggest year ever everyone home, understand push get people back office. much wiser now. comment brought back memories experiences. hehehe. Yeah result worse selection employer. true entice people come work office higher market wages, I'm saying that's going happen. They’re going give us choice. I’m one them! I'm 30's I've never even seen cheque. 

Why exist? We're putting together big hiring plan right without concept engineers working remotely we'd nearly double seating space. Since remote proven effective we're planning switching spaces drop-in areas teams come work together bit want, schedule around teams. Mostly expect everyone home time.

I personally prefer office day meetings two kids tend get loud vacation. 

Having option work home though, without feel guilty deal shoddy conference equipment rarely it? That's gold. issue job. Sure busy days days scrolling Reddit watching YouTube videos. I’d much rather home getting chores done time instead sitting waiting clock tick work. office jobs miserable asshats hate home life want back office. reveled extra OT pre pandemic. rather work office around screaming kids nagging wife.  know *you* going office also helps support people’s livelihoods, right? train conductor, coffee shop, wherever order take-out janitorial staff cleans building depend going work least part-time. don’t live vacuum. money spent wild also traded something infinitely valuable, time spent alive, best years life simply commuting existing limbo traversing interstitial spaces. Brazil, infrastructure vaccinate multiple million people day. enough COVID vaccines yet. stress impacts i’m screwed, lol US UK far ahead banned exports vaccines made factories countries. EU taking ‘none us vaccinated us are’ approach recently bought rule limiting exports countries US UK doing. I'm one weird ones actually enjoyed working on-site *still* wants remain WFH pandemic. financial, weather, sleep incentives bigger pull occasional on-the-clock socialisation never went beyond campus anyway. Zero commute, 90 minutes sleep every workday, &amp; rainy/snowy/super hot/cold bus stop waiting. mention eating lunch home. Better deal WFH world. Anyone know Pfizer gonna allowed people 10-15 whatever range was? I’m curious I’m high schooler half people get half can’t. I've wfh since 2018. never want work office again. soccer joke. Pay Europeans mind. Must kids  Spot on, call ""Boomer Bait"" Yes point still stands. Honestly replied another post Congress gets paid much. thought responding that’s yeah people survive little yet people means complain much.  - Tests: 1,360,761 - Cases: 71,752 - Deaths: 800 - Currently Hospitalized: 39,474 - Currently ICU: 7,529 (+/- compared day last week Tests/Cases/Deaths &amp; yesterday Hosp/ICU)

Source:  mean hate go office, going office become important part get brain switch work mode. Maybe find house enough space office would change brain hard time telling difference since I'm sitting front different computer one play games on. Eh, J&amp;J study. October 2020. didn’t solid idea vaccine side effects back - data wasn’t published. It’s surprisingly easy convince side effects, - sore arm tiredness, got placebo. Sounds like syncope, worry it. looking forward P1. P2 dominant ones. think understand socialising works.

A couple people going drink work. join turns great night. Compared everyone logging day over. simple things like group chat lunch. Quite ironic generation told us believe everything internet falls conspiracy theories ""my friend shared Facebook trust true"". US seems first 

It's funny EU throwing huge tantrum towards US J&amp;J despite similar situation UK AZ one. Almost always politics rather vaccines. already second Kent variant. Fellow women (late 20s-early 30s) took Moderna, bad side effects first shot? 

(And insights pain/fever worse manageable period right it, I’d appreciate it) hear you. reminded menopause hot flashes, check temperature went 1-2 degrees dropped normal ~97 degrees. cycled really fast lasted minutes time. whole body sweat felt chilled. Many years ago, got really nasty bronchitis two nights row temperature shot 104 degrees hour broke massive sweat. body fascinating. crappy felt morning, feel fine now. hope doesn’t happen next time, I’ll better prepared. someone hasn’t even seen face coworkers 🙃 Yeah. I’m that. I’m pointing math 55,000  many total? maybe I’m missing number somewhere? Tell us much hate laws wife always nagging get respect blah blah blah gives fuck? 100%

I drive past office yesterday get covid shot drive awful wanted die. farthest I've drove year. thought every day dealing people made sick. likely deal culture shock uncomfortable back society isolated long. Push keep getting get back normal. got this! trying rude here, What’s stopping getting together lunches work? dude replied below. 

He’s Texas concept dense city. bit topic, believe kids high age like (if can) really selfish. barely energy anything kid, plus time reach 20s, likely near end life, needing take care you. mom 44, though still love much, really wish would least 10 years that. Highly unlikely mood effect antibodies way shape form. Yeah 2 days person thing probably best way go. Schedule meetings in-person stuff days. That's amazing. Think time wasting commute. obscene amount time getting keep family  stuff. needs stay new normal. cannot imagine giving again. $40 week deductions like taxes. Actual amount much less.  That's pharmaceuticals work. like shopping supermarket. can't ""take business elsewhere"" cancer make cancer drug need, unless genuinely hoping worse outcomes cancer patients pettiness towards AZ. work super high stress job work night vaccine survived, albeit feeling like garbage. don’t think make difference long term. TIL office jobs outsourced covid wfh procedures emplemented.

I guess someone told companies work home years started lol.  realized saw Alberta tags yesterday first time forever. [Isn't COVID restrictions please clap Yeah plan moving person college good Lord’s will. People keep telling it’s sad us college awesome them. hope experience Funny say way. pay performance went door. understand everyone took hit. glad fortunate lose single day work. IT, several us volunteered taking day donate leave keep others employed. 

The issue increases. model went door concerned lose talent. pretty sad excuse. hope people become smaller smaller minority get realize wrong. coworker (Moderna vaccine #2) go ER get antiemetic couldn’t stop vomiting. doctors basically like idk you’re vomiting go home. i’m worried possible shit show employees moved far away office, assuming WFH future, get called back risk losing job fucking lakes beer instead water.  going make payment car unnecessary shit lol. Good luck Like everything 100% 0%. coma decades, dont know job could already outsourced long wfh implemented, jobs outsourced decades 

Oof Yeah, we're finding outdoor transmission basically nothing, especially since full capacity supposed socially distanced. That's /u/split_vision literally pointed places indoor gatherings people around NFL games. There's way studies know anyone contracted COVID bleachers game. reason know virus odds low. Rather, must ancillary things game causing COVID spikes.

Same thing Sturgis. whole thing motorcycle gathering even granting probably socially distanced, transmission cycles high per se. But, bars restaurants end serving transmission hubs.

The racial justice protests gathering points indoors (relatively). simple that. Yeah think so. like company work think see we've uptick productivity WFH. Yes, know. Maybe explanation clear. Texas opened eligibility reached around 40% willing adults vaccinated. went priority, risk specific (older) age groups quickly.

The difference strategy Netherlands age groups continue youngest. moment open everyone. stay closed ""system"" way youngest least risk person vaccinated end Q2. that, still groups eligible vaccinations. worked remote 14 years. problems connecting coworkers. Especially zoom/teams. prefer required particular place x days per week go somewhere warmer winter example. Maybe answer question then. 
What stopping making policy 50/50 wfh? Use office get meetings planning/designing done remote rest. Leave sort flexibility piece people sort come go please. stuck contract. go ahead continue use making employees happy? want full time office work still get that. Lol good point I'm moron taps beer instead water, right? Yeah don’t understand that, specifically SF.  big dogs pushing WFH getting leases can. 

From talent acquisition standpoint don’t know SF office makes sense like years ago.  used necessity get talent pool, now?  

I dunno, time tell sure. anyone else thrown within minutes taking Pfizer vaccine? sure did. Within couple minutes, felt hot, started sweating profusely, felt faint, barfed. minutes felt fine again.

The thing happened immediately swine flu shot 2009, vaccines ever problem me. Curious there’s common ingredient two body doesn’t agree with. received J&amp;J vaccine yesterday. Day later whole family comes one wearing mask except sister recently exposed covid week ago. happy. understand people take seriously. spends around 90% time complaining 10% time nothing 

They power. can’t shit

That organization needs reformed This. years. Something sounds questionable? Shoot email need. Cc manager. 

If can't that, maybe tackle problem another way. Definitely agree considered points. point jobs look flexibility vs pay. definitely moment felt like office would vacation. Drawing line home work encroach space tricky. know growth issue prior Covid regards space people actually office based job roles. 

I volunteered recommended metrics taken see office space really need vs employees WFH. 

Good talking you! great day bay! Good. start white Republican neighborhoods vaccinating fighting vaccine hesitancy misinformation communities going next challenge. I’m sorry kinda pity people complaining lack productivity.

Do y’all really socialize people work consider friends? I’d quit workplace didn’t offer expected productive every minute office.

As several suggested, Hybrid model strike good balance probably common.  funny one trace back anyone/place cases (eye roll).

Yes, statistical signals often work. one trace whether got lung cancer due genetic predisposition, due smoking, due alcohol, due diet, due factor. say smoking increases chance lung cancer X% statistically looking big population smokers comparing non-smokers.

That simplistic analysis numbers computed (ideally RCTs, otherwise might confounding variable account for), enough show reasoning sound. right are! 

The alternative implies understand medical research statistics say certain *also* true. live NY? sounds suspiciously lot like LIRR Manhattan commute.  reason think wfh viable bargaining tool industries. work defense heavily regulated requires us citizen. job done remotely, someone us Fair enough. simple answer manager, people report powerful are. Obviously scale well, need managers reporting well, organization (and result, paycheck) grows. stop licking public surfaces meme please! symptomless made mistake going jog it(a test days later showed it), I'm paranoid now.
 odd racing heart stopped quit job started lexapro I'm pretty sure anxiety case. 

Which predated virus issue before. Everyone’s productivity decline go back office.  can’t believe it’s low.  seen surveys company almost 95% want stay remote. switched jobs bit ago part reason department permanently remote.  generally report vaccination status everyone tested sample studies confirmed effectiveness 85-97% range. individual basis I'm sure number people legitimately care ever go office and/or perfectly content forming relationships people online. I'm actually pretty far direction myself, fairly low need desire socialization work communicate well internet writing. population level, pretty delusional think quality preponderance relationships built centralized office setting come even close matched get Microsoft Teams video calls per week. even remotely close, totally ridiculous suggest otherwise. basic human nature shit. I'm sure fairly low proportion 34% would actually quit came time Well good.....because can't sit home keep living government wanting work. People getting vaccinated things back normal soon. South African variant loose Brazil pretty much guarantees spread vaccine boosters necessary everyone around world. disabled community particular really disappointed whole situation. They've asking able work home decades. everyone affected pandemic, suddenly possible. That's bitter pill swallow. Patient zero, obviously rather million 'sissy men' one you... there

We cry together That’s great!!! Congrats. 

I normally travel ton, good. family loved home time. first short business trip next week. I’m kind looking forward it, anxiety it’s long. 

Good luck you! Thank you! anyone (state, country, etc.) breaking current cases vaccinated vs. unvaccinated? seems data available highly suggestive overall vaccine effectiveness effectiveness versus variants. anyone seen reported anywhere? Thanks. People getting downvoted there's legitimate points made avoiding particular vaccine. Well, could certainly mean lot things! 
 
I guess confusion ""the problem"" making decisions, instead elect people make decisions us, saying constitution have. *explicitly* constitution written say! whole point US Constitution outline type governing taking issue! confusing, sir. Well remember long bus rides tennis matches tennis team. working home since 2016 save time get ready driving meet deadlines. told around Feb 2020 needed start coming more, like, wish. CV-19 hit March? Yeah. pulled non-manufacturing people sent us home laptops.

100% correct ‘smoking joking’ goes break room. could saved hundreds thousands actually pushed masking, following CDC guidelines, debunking insane supporters' conspiracy theories. H-053-R variant.

We every variant already. feel this. Literally said oldest kid healthiest winter I've ever had. Masks 4ever (or least every winter). joking?! Kids show vax proof public kindergarten onward. scanning submitting forms ten year old since started. Public schools absolutely require proof every place business, public transit, hotels Airbnb. studies claimed shelter-in-place orders saved thousands lives, reassess analyses show reliable. find shelter-in-place orders detectable health benefits, modest effects behavior, small adverse effects economy. senior firm, hesitate switch jobs get away boss wants shove us back office...just hover us. Nope main idea people think Sam Adams Coors. marketing. Making friends work = get taken advantage of

I deliberately avoid making friends work reason Unfortunately viewers tune in. look many sub, lot still WANT told pandemic never end. Fuck yes. genuinely understand - WANT forced social situations people choose, boss peering shoulder dropping whenever, idle chatter productive whatsoever people give fuck give fuck you? Friend mine already going office himself. cant stay focused home. wife’s company announced plan return work, bunch people quit. Lol, whoops. relate too. lived worked remote short time parents using new remote opportunity move closer across country. love parents wasnt ideal. always felt like way. /r/ThatHappened study reduction traumatic injuries LA stay home orders. I.e. less car accidents, knife fights study actually examined peoples movements, found stay home reduce movement appreciably, meaning people actually stay home. I’m that’s every thing lockdown work hours. Nope need forced drive 50+ miles day shamed spending half paycheck EV. relate. thought getting 7am every morning get ready work get time trapped building 5 days week almost 4pm commute back home sounds like waste life right now. 3 days building 2 days home sounds much manageable me. forgetting one thing side spectrum. full work home possibility would company X pay 50k year example get someone qualified India 15k year? (outsourcing basically)

Hybrid way go. Management. jobs depend it. Chase bank least 5 years Tofino fav.. absolutely magical Don’t forget maladjusted extroverts think everyone miserable home really they’re attention-starved. (Or people can’t stand around families). Keep mind reddit, there's selection bias toward introverts chronically online people.

I know plenty people would never leave house required. Others work keep lights on, care less WFH affects productivity. (Nothing wrong attitude imho, people different motives).

But also know plenty people really like do, get lot enjoyment going work interacting coworkers. say ""safe enough"" again? 

I literally answered already. high enough vaccination % (70%+) achieve herd immunity. Nice. Comment deleted talking thing comments aren’t deleted.

Oh well. Bis automod Last week team asked question email another team format ticket needed specific work literally responded back send ticket asking question format ticket find wanted actual work ticket done. chuckled know (the company cut ton base labor us fudge numbers charge capital projects found way charge question guess), still annoying hell. Fuck office. Never wake 6:30am spend hour getting ready blow drying straightening hair leave 7:30 hit hour traffic walk office 15 min late forgetting put mascara wearing different color shoes forgetting wear deodorant again.  figured 10 years ago!Now l work people appreciate hours l choose without making obvious! Fucking scabby vulture.  Yes, booked one soon eligible, still doesn’t get next week. Exactly. Also, reason Im full support 4 day work week lol much anyway cut day make work per-day I'm board.  Ireland one does. Yeah, bank account information check anyway. really difference using online pay check, information. Expect check signature. working 1 day week home, Mar 2020 offices closed, back announced (very small) office would officially closing lease expires summer I'm permanent WFH. love it, introvert personality well suited seeing people barely change work wise. people directly work even state I'm anyway everything virtual.   workplace likely staggered opening (going office 2 days week, 3, etc.)

But full time office work looks July. 

I like office maybe 2-3 days week, personally. know thread big love infest wfh hate it. live alone, life sucks working home. Life already lonely living alone add working alone mix recipe mental health crisis. Fuck. You’re right. haha right, thought stress depression hurts immune system concerned Remote work sucks

You suck. Sure, let's assume absolute worst case scenario live according that. :) 

That would make PTSD group therapy session! 
""I 2 tours Iraq saw best friends blown bits.""
""I survived years abuse alcoholic mother.""
""I might COVID, idk. mean, symptoms feel fine, but, know...it's possible.""   company 10k+ polled similar know want go back full time people 50s. external interaction work miss that. Oklahoma actually tested people, we'd there. Guaranteed. Went hospital pain, umbilical hernia strangulation. 

THREE times asked tested actually went covid symptoms urgent care. 

THREE TIMES:

Asked urgent care doctor test covid.

Asked ER doctors test covid.

Asked Surgeon 2 days later test covid.

&amp;#x200B;

Each damn time, told no, fever present. need covid test' Despite coughing, chest constriction, chills, 99.3 low grade fever. Day surgery (4 days later), mandatory covid test 'protect surgeons doctors'. 

GUESS FUGGIN"" WHAT. Positive Covid. surgery. 

 2 days later, broke 101+ fever 10 damn days. 

Someone said contact tracer state contacted said 'oh yeah good go back work, testing positive due antibodies' set return date 2 days tested hospital. So, yeah. Oklahoma full SHIT. 34% say going to, 1% actually follow through. Thank Many parents worried long term effects, death. Again, don’t agree them, public school get decide half parents unreasonable refuse work needs way.

I also don’t think really get school funding works. can’t magically eliminate 20% (or huge portion) building maintenance needs even easily sell buildings. also can’t magically make district smaller. costs like buildings transportation remain same. real area cut staff. could cut elementary classroom teachers, guess. That’s going set district success long term things get back normal. usually ends happening specials electives first go. kids choose person fewer options arts, electives, on. see that’s better outcome anyone small portion current teachers focus choose virtual next year, able smoothly switch back normal schedule following year. sharpest knife drawer within minutes day mom threw Pfizer vaccine went one single meeting. hour. Three people including me.

45 minutes gossiping complaining two office daily. kinda sat there.

It insane.  Honestly sounds awful God forbid physically work office full time get full time pay, amirite? Wow. know opinion, opinion opinion horrible. Go bar something, social butterfly. details biontech mRNA I'd 100% everything allowed go back normal. fair, pandemic made extra hard meet new people anywhere. like coworkers, I’d easily trade office social time flexible schedule extra hour every day spend fun activity outside work. 

I’ve found friends brought work better isolation, it’s great long term. *if could...* Anyone would rather find new job that’s remote partially remote go back office. job tells “come back you’re fired”, going quit? I’d rather employed commute. 

I’m seeing headline. doesn’t want work home? Less people would annoyed stuck inside could go bars working home.  getting vaxxed please eat something beforehand! parents said told workers AZ far? manufactured? year time wanted office job mention developing good mentor relationship you're, say, new engineer. know little new grad, need build experience training someone older. Sometimes, formally arranged company, often informal happens someone takes liking you.

I learning really fast site, there's physical process observe interact with. pandemic, went WFH alternating weeks, basically forgotten site. Definitely better layed off, discussing preferences. work public accounting firm I’d work groups mandatory saturdays, they’d 6-8 hours, 4-6 hours spent bullshitting. fucking despise people. didn’t to, never go office again. I’m pushing hybrid return client sites. It’s much efficient request much shit ask many questions client it’s significantly easier done client’s office vs remote. Cause jump legal hurdles hire person. lot people wfh cannot officially another country, cannot even officially different state. There's tax implications company consider letting employees work state/out country well various labor laws depending jurisdiction. anyone young got vaccine? I'm 21 get astrazeneca vaccine next week Australia. fully understand AZ Debakel need careful rush. Hungary approve it? so, won’t information need approve it?

It manufacturer capacity hence actually want approved yet could deliver anyway? Brazil still #18 ""covid deaths/million"" list. remove small fake countries like San Marino, still #15 charts, UK, US, Italy, etc.

That's Yes, Pfizer plans applying month.

First, guaranteed Pfizer apply month.

Second, FDA promise timeline approval application filed. hurry approve vaccines since vaccines available EUA. important FDA maintain public's trust cut corners reviewing COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked long take get BLA? clock start get cannot predict long take manufacturer submit Biologics License Application (BLA). “clock” submission BLA FDA issuance EUA completion clinical trials. idiot ceos insist seeing peasants face face. simply production capacity within EU fulfill EU countries orders; 

Probably take orders then. *smiles armchair immunology lesson comments* Yeah cat officially bag People slack find way matter working remotely office. Spain restricted use AZ 60-65 now. Italy expected Zoom courses largely going away fall semester. I'd hope would fine completely person so, parents feed homeless simultaneously children order starve. That's indeed globalization works. Yet still think start equalizing salaries two individuals, extension two populations general. way good thing fighting global poverty, think western employees pushing working-from-home mind. High schools also require vaccines, I'm sure they'll start requiring colleges pay bill vaccines? new strains? government coming realization lockdowns necessary? I'm oil land

The premier fuckin turd, half assed response, restrictions teeth, RW, racist, evangelical, conspiracy, Q assholes blended jenkem-like morass fermented shit. It’s socializing inside bad ventilation that’s real problem. seems contradict Fauci said 70-90% vaccination needed herd immunity.

So who's right? agree. simply ethical vaccinate people AZ side effects confirmed especially given fact safer vaccines there. volte face adopt US stance puts countries position cant escape.

There still massive difference EU US stance vaccine exports.

For one, Pfizer still exporting without restrictions whatsoever EU. AZ restricted, delivered quarter agreed to.

Meanwhile, rollout J&amp;J EU delayed originally planned fill-and-finish active ingredient (produced EU) done US plant, US basically said ""if send stuff way, getting back."" Maybe try presenting well prepared portfolio work do. Also, consider networking. Knowing right people make huge difference career. never know, guy one office may good buddies boss may put good word you. India far N.1 fatalities cases simple size population lack effective control it. seen total chaos brought last year’s attempt control virus leaving millions travel foot hundreds miles, cannot see way India. Lol would imagine full approvals come summer, yes done depending state. done knows? confirm, quit job Especially since, reading article, appears ”experiment” consisted evidence-based approach compared countries’ ”seems like obviously ought work” approach. 

Of two, latter actually closer experiment.  sad really. reality everyone mercy government, matter free think require it. brainer. Oh wow. source? proof back up? turn real well Texas, Florida Georgia lifting restrictions. /s Moderna 2nd shot sucked! 8 hours shot experienced brutal headaches, fever, chills, arm pain, muscle aches overall exhaustion. total suckfest 36 hours went away. would get again! last year sucked helps others makes life somewhat normal it’s worth it! respect everyone’s choice glad made right one me! got kicked chest. context 107 145 cases detected NZ's border quarantine facilities since start March (74%) came India far still less cases per capita basis US. OP probably upset another lockdown place. EMA agency giving approval whole European Union israel gov always know sell. residents tell different story. I’m sales engineer company literally sells software enables organizations work anywhere. fall, we’re going back office. fuck. They're sorry anymore people don’t home office struggle creating work mindset sitting living room. people miss interacting coworkers daily basis think japan avoided numbers countries like us, italy, brazil had? Lazy people definitely living tiny, studio apartment.  Absolutely. Thank much. nice talking you. ***It known, however, Israel’s health care system vast rich databases.***

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* one giving hard data, will.

The short answer yes, running willing people.

The longer answer is, ~30% population 16 years old, able get vaccine. leaves ~70% population eligible. population, ~59% gotten first dose, ~54% gotten doses. 59%/70% = 84%, means still ~16% population received 1st dose, probably really close % population hesitant. Obviously, time goes on, hesitancy go down, close vaccinating everyone wants one. That's allowed second doses almost catch first doses, pace first doses running people.

What help get percentages higher? vaccine needs get approved 16. Pfizer going get approved 12-15 year olds soon, hopefully 12 later year. And, maybe 16% gotten yet goes ~10% end year, allow get often cited 75% needed reach true herd immunity. Don’t worry, people saying weirdos one liked talking work anyway. Japan got straight fucked demographics. majority population far grave, give shit future. feel real bad friends there, gonna bleak future youths Japan. Israel’s 0.5 percent positivity rate amazing Yes does. Otherwise prove worth existence without claiming offense everything? /s live, massive implications housing market. people spending good amount time home, they're realizing spaces small 500 sq ft condo city cracked without restaurants, bars, nightlife entertainment. batshit insane haven’t approved Moderna yet ""So, do?"" ""Me? crazy."" They’re requiring next school year approved. fail get authorization reason (obviously won’t 100 million Americans fine) I’m sure institutions reconsider. precedent requiring vaccines. FDA authorization isn’t far EUA + 150 million successful vaccines, don’t know want make issue. Disagree there. started new job remotely month ago great. issues smooth starting company person. high schools well? There’s not. 

It’s absolute idiots armchair scholars think restriction freedom immediate violation Constitution Facebook group claims so. horrible side effects second shot Moderna. Started 8 hours shot lasted 36 hours. Brutal ... fever, headache, muscle pain, body ache, chills. brutal 36 hours. WORTH IT! snapped right back normal move life. Mentally last year terror unknown. helps move forward. It’s tough decision right one me. bureaucrats informed administrations problems plant. Let say this: past, federal regulators could take action correct problem shut down.  authority taken away decision routed top political appointee Whitehouse. owner calls congressman Senators. case gets squashed, slap wrist, reassigned another lenient investigator. started Clinton Gingrich. Keep posted! PM like two days. I'm interested.

In theory, big response side effects effect younger people - stronger immune response.

Maybe side effects wider known many people age getting them. I'm opposed it, good know. tables turned. People finally discovered quality life home/work balance... slave wages

You know different places different living expenses Alec berenson piece shit he’s still saying Israel proof anti vax bs Fox News anybody know see r value? eran segal doesn’t post im lost boy me. anything, want word go people know possibly take next day work. According who? law again, everyone wears masks they're supposed to. 
 
Masks magical. fact, sounds like mask usage may causing harm good people focused ignoring possible behavioral changes. there's still precedence private schools required unapproved vaccines. answers question previous poster.

We know sure vaccines approved time, move require vaccines definitely setting new precedence. Lolz well define better differently guess. vaccine looks better one. That's bummer. something fans? looking Civility Air 2 fans looks kinda bulky clear (want something that's solid can't see mouth found insightful interview current COVID-19 situation India Ramanan Laxminarayan, founder director Center Disease Dynamics, Economics &amp; Policy (CDDEP) Washington, D.C. New Delhi, senior research scholar Princeton University. I’m curious types medical conditions would prevent individual getting vaccine? Especially 3 approved vaccines new types way soon different ingredients. things aren’t everyone knows Exactly this. visible!  CA resident here:

Had job that's kept whole time, traveling heavily populated cities rural ones. family taking things seriously I've kept little lot places enforcing masks disrupting normal lives strictly cuz want hear it. go day, wear mask, remain mostly cautious. Masks bother me, people always but, masks don't. I've never harassed judged. Californians getting vaxed high speeds everyday. There's us get see sides California daily/weekly basis interesting see lifestyles exist close together (yet far apart) numbers still dropping. 

Im guessing strictly bars,clubs, concerts (service industry) cuz nothing else really much different. play band plays lot shows tours that's reason got vaccinated. Luckily VA way ahead state giving essential workers shots. Sure could sooo much long but, honestly, play show 50-100 people drink beer. I'll honestly feel amazing. Im anxious see Texas's #'s next month Newsom opens up. I'm hoping terrible im hoping reports Israel actually promising sound far vaccine stoping spread. year im unable optimistic pessimistic anything. I'm guy people reach easily 20hr email convos pay period top MHRA giving pass pass AZ safety issues came trials. Expediting reviews, publishing cherry picked data twice, name getting vaccine faster. Every western bio pharmaceutical company regulator found balance making safe effective vaccine except UK we’re reaping whirlwind. Lackadaisical atitudes towards safety led situation stir vaccine hesitancy least afford it. Well that's reason people want go back office. Same, cases going country, yet company considering opening offices sometime year. Michigan, also going 3rd lockdown, whose people governor lost survive also left chat. Plague would like word.

That said, yea he's pessimist. Every year P-1 him. here. Even banned comments. Countries with

* Good response Covid-19: Australia, NZ, Taiwan. country adopted ZeroCovid strategy would fit here. 
* Fast vaccination rollout: Top 5 descending order are: Israel, UK, Chile, USA, Bahrain. Reliable data: Israel, UK, USA. country testing enough catch almost positive cases, three close. Ontario another month-long lockdown point I'm proving data there, much doubt miraculously appeared day looked  certainly hope still worry getting sick variants

As others mentioned, vaccines protect variants far science tell.

The real concern variants spread really fast kids get it. Yeah bad kids, still statistically worse flu (not sure much)  negotiated yearly review wanted come two days week office resumes. Herd immunity never achieved without vaccination. Maybe folk missed ""without vaccination"" part, yeah: strategy herd immunity letting folk catch work.

That gives much opportunity virus mutate. Every mutation (potential) step closer able reinfect people became immune first strain. Racists  guess lucky obesity increases risk stupidity *fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucked*.  I’m you. hesitate recommends change every week? didn’t need to, personally would waited there’s enough supply mRNA vaccines. Even you’re objective well informed, bad feeling remains. 

But wonder something like would ever found without pandemic. Even trials would usually take time, wouldn’t many people (I believe would thousands). Ebola vaccine may faults cases blood disorders would rare scattered. I've literally asked friends said same. cannot return office they'll find different job. No!! Don’t send here! barely got things control!   Meh, I’ve driven wife work days day didn’t. fucking loved getting spend extra half hour morning would've thought literally nothing stop virus spreading. proponent building wall block Florida rest US sending conservatives anti-vaxxers  56% citizens vaccinated another 15% recovered, Israel may first country people immune protect aren’t.

Is misleading Israel literally refuse vaccinate anyone already Covid massive amount overlap there... 74% American adults overweight 43% obese. Sounds right, pretty good representation US population.

Personally I’m glad flexible become new normal course service industry going take massive hit done already. automation killing service industry roles eventually anyways, covid sped up. alberta aiming doubling per capita rate think. small asthmatic person... forced sit cold AC vent, next smelly chain smoker reeks cigs hacks shit day VS. working home underwear dog sleeps feet I'm surrounded gorgeous plants...GOSH CAN'T DECIDE BETTER! enough safer vaccines everyone wanted one, I'd agree. Unfortunately, aren't. I'd rather AZ Pfizer months now.  Also include South Korea. It’s important mention people always say it’s “they’re islands” “lockdowns,” they’ve never either. Vietnam also done amazing, given far less wealthy country. know Japan 500k total cases 9 k deaths? Triggered little man. Seems like quite lot insecurities deal wkth. spiffing old resume?  waste time banning anti-vaxx society, send guantanamo build camps, seem like enormous waste time ressource. Canadians literally stop seething. get vaccine scraps done, worry want call ""normal live, 20% stores schools bars closed"" lockdown, fine. gathered people country never got COVID, got COVID didn’t good immune response protected, unvaccinated, vaccinated 5 20% still vulnerable symptomatic illness, you’d population size independent country would top 10 countries size. least couple months get herd immunity.

Basically person would normally pass 3 people two 3 immune pass one person R drops effectively 1. saying can’t dog park pandemic? It’s outside, distance wear mask. Going park one things still perfectly normally almost risk infection Cute. believe television experts politicians loose credibility wrong. care. Proportional population Canada still less active new cases/day. Canadians scared virus Americans wait thousands branches start closing. happened US year two covid hit. Yes, Pfizer plans applying month.

It's guaranteed Pfizer apply COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked long take get BLA? clock start get cannot predict long take manufacturer submit Biologics License Application (BLA). “clock” submission BLA FDA issuance EUA completion clinical trials.

Also, takes 10 months approval application filed. Priority filing cut little 6 months. FDA hurry approve vaccines since vaccines available EUA. important FDA maintain public's trust cut corners reviewing application.

If everything goes well, Pfizer vaccine may approved October. little pandemic fatigue here, one really changed behavior due pandemic. Like, restuarants close bit earlier bit cities-- bummer, isnt something would cause *fatigue*, especially months. 

The Kent variant really fucking shit though. Somehow Japan able avoid surge cases basic hygiene everyone following rules, infective variant looks like wont sufficient. 

Unfortunately, Japan largely believes immune lmao. hope Aso gets first. It’s funny cite 3/11 though Fukushima situation never really dealt with, continues pose massive, ongoing risk, mostly covered PR upbeat country covers Hana wa Saku played NHK. Understanding gives good invite pandemic also managed. I'd reckon sometime June we're going place close minimum cases hope CDC say screw cut everyone loose recommendations guidelines anything international travel Oh boy, surreal. Crazy time alive. Maybe? Pretty soon overwhelming amount data backing up. Hopefully national weed legalisation soak lot them. People seem understand growth rates. like people saying ""We hundred, need worry anything."" poster meant r0 r, aka reproduction rate *without measures*. r effective rate tally every day event attending. Obviously give fuck Ugh ugh ughympics. What? doctor thinks coworker safer getting exposed covid? disease that’s killed millions. vaccine killed 0 people alternative coworker locking house til cases hit 0. coworker getting vaccinated anything all?? Sounds cover story honest. CDC says pretty much everyone get vaxed. buddy dad chrons got vaccine ASAP.  Canada population CA can’t make shit British Columbia Alberta. Let blade runner times return.

As someone living California, interesting choice words. months, annual California fire season gonna start. Hey, that’s me! Yup, 1 3 still significant minority  could mass testing well small segment population. Hungary gave approval. nothing stopping EU countries same. It’s government invested whole, everything together thing. costing us lives. drop polls showing German citizens think that. long don’t get resistant strain Perhaps, made optimistic calculations output.  don’t need 100%, Fauci said something 70-80% enough. course one believes virus end, endemic already. study productivity increases breaks. unions them. Evidentially Bezos study history. Besides christian colleges, think vast majority schools require covid 19 vaccine. honestly impressive. state 1/5 population 9 times area gets many cases per day. hit Israel's rate vaccination, we're going like cases. could pay Pfizer... completely wrong.

The risk wasn’t picked trials general it’s something really rare. sample size wasn’t big enough.

Not sure mean here? Santa Claus kid's story. think Christians actually believe Santa exists?

No. much insinuated do. talking about? think need re-read love hear ""constructive"" argument turn atheist.

I would love find argument. problem issue argued, persons needs convincing. argument?

That absolutely sign god exists. can't prove negative. OK claim god exists, claim anything exists. Everyone create reality, demand views laugh anyone's faith? I'm confused accusations.

In context written understand comment wider debate general. OK, might look like strawman. I'll give half point. personally laugh spaghetti-monster too. I'm honored respected person someone weird obsession telling wrong unprompted.

Unprompted? even talking first reply (where referred wikipedia). commenting topic right define christian not. even know christian wrote it. accused hating christianity, attacking etc. simply replied that. much genuinely respect person, like want force beliefs you, would like either.

First belief. Come think it, really stop using word ""atheist"" myself. dedicated word needed default, normal position. word people believe Santa Claus, would word people believe god(s)? Second, I'm forcing anything you. unprompted said, contrary driving debate forward. fine me, pretend that's extreme take. Christian, also 100% believer science data. exclusive. 100% pro-vax (getting COVID vax week), 100% proponent combating climate change fullest, refuse dabble conspiracy theories kind.

Good, got 2 3 right here. never said exclusive. made comparison irrational religion worse? ... overlook people say religion horrible thing.

My opposition religions nothing ethics all. 100% irrelevant. irrational views physical world built. existence god(s), paradise, hell, miracles stuff like that. **This, this, basis opposition religion**. History full good people probably good christian, argument exists god. (I'm fan guy: , wrongly believed god existed.)

When comes good bad behavior, religions worse better ideologies moral frameworks people build. human made rules, good not.

Also, think used word see rational argument idea religion general, specific religions I'm sure general idea. ... think science religion go hand hand.

You prove negative. I'm spaghetti-monster expert, suspect can't disprove either paragraph questions, somehow try see place christianity there. hardly argument all, follows use defend religion choosing. can't right. actually suspect see weak attempt justification really is. think so. concerns tests false (not travellers dishonest, fake testing centres taking money give fake negative results unaware potential travellers). temporary suspension flights give government enough time investigate decide needs put place. officially recovered COVID Israel offered one dose vaccine.

So far take rate less 40%. salaries low, taxes high, **the culture extremely conformist** freedom national value. Don’t envy us pandemic restrictions you’ve pleasure experiencing reality it. Vaccination province still restricted people 60 (55 locally) we’re fourth month curfew, seventh month without gyms indoor dining. Compare Florida. though began snake giving apple man woman... enlighten me. positivity rates make sense unit measurement anything cdc fauci encouraging us decrease denominator positivity rate equation which... Omg guessed it... Increases overall Sooooo weird random coincidence we've seen [95% Covid cases since January peak, drop directly corresponded vaccine drive...? Also claiming fake would pretty easy obtain fake test result India. asked, chance might currently be, which, say, standard practice. Getting second hit Moderna juice weekend, prepared feel like ass couldn’t care less Others said already, poor wording newspaper indeed. boomers want office. Boomers assholes. Nice euphemism ""AstraZeneca recommended adults age 50"". Right, thanks much this. different newspaper website posted, makes much sense :) can’t case since people vaccinated still get Covid, though it’s seeming mild viral symptoms. still shedding a) unimmunized infected b) vaccinated people infected .

Procurement actually going reasonably well though. Despite much domestic manufacturing speak of, Canada behind UK US G20 countries % population one dose. Could better course things seem ramping thankfully. can’t get news 4 days old-- hope nothing developed there.)

Seems touch-and-go. super impressed Australia achieved past year, situations like (incoming traveller, isolated, nurses got infected took community) lead believe control bit knife edge.

It could quite easily fall apart community spread gets going still months good vaccine coverage. Canada, land charm. COVAX allowed.

I referring article Stuff Thanks response. wanna know I’ve weird issues lately want know there’s correlation. 

So even year two later give blood would able tell ago? estimated number people prior infections also vaccinated? Seems like 25% vaccinated, 25% prior infection immunity, overlap, less 50%. know several people already Covid also got vaccine. wish could deprioritized already least encourage wait. guess it’s moot it’s wide open anyone, could shaved week two towards herd immunity taken approach. I'd imagine slutty people would already done despite risks Masks prevents transfer touch Im Israel agree,its probably bit early celebrate keep wearing masks people refuse take vaccine. get wearing rn it’s still rolled fall want one get one shouldn’t force social distancing mask wearing antivaxers Trumps fault blame Joe Biden YES

Please dear god stop “enforcement” language. It’s absolutely ridiculous makes people want actively rail it. Using arm best thing prevent reduce soreness. Idk. college attending kids family. College packed fluid swappy, rest life. know least one college good campus shut campus learning people parties campus. would say least require vaccines proof there's percentage group trustworthy.

 vaccines good younger people less likely severe illness, seem reduce transmissibility new variants much transmissible possibly fatal. 

I think informed risk kind situation. someone feel comfortable understandable. sounds ""safe enough"" everyone gets vaccines. 

We're sort emerging science experiment interesting see next year. Meri patni hindustani hay yaar. summer jailbreak aka everyone goes wild!

Bye bye forced prude! good. ppl social interactions work draining around seem boundaries imposition peoples' time.

I getting along teams contributing workplace good morale, cannot give breaks/lunch work time hang people life. find younger people get also tons stuff jam day older colleagues tend draw meetings always favour social things cut time. there's feeling team player give time them. boss surprised, yeah. still filled it. Why? Scared people don’t want spend time learning proper measures wanting risk all. Honestly I’d much rather see opposite (people rejecting masks completely). Oxygen levels 92-93% prolonged period valid reason concern, [considering hypoxia covid patients isn’t always negotiate Pfizer 36 mil vaccine
so 60 mil total mom got first moderna shot last night feel fine shes rough go it. Cannot stand masks. annoying, can’t wait people vaccinated here. socialize vaccinated adults trust everyone wearing masks, life won’t normal us kids vaccinated. PCR based amplification specific sequence found virus genetic material, sequence mutate, current tests work anymore, propagation untraceable new tests devised. 


We got one France weeks ago. Bhakts still small number sub. give 16-18 vaccines yet? Pre pandemic killing work. realized work didnt actually give damn pandemic. quarantines best thing ever happened mental health. never, ever work another place doesnt treat like person pay accordingly. Im okay self employing myself, id rather poor happy, turning 40 mentally shattered health tanking. figure exactly vaccine predisposed risk mitigate issue non-issue. think real reason investigate this, make AZ look bad. 

Its rare enough there's chance certain predisposition towards tested for. Look Hungary, Slovakia, Czechia. countries dealing high level infections death since start year. seems Czechia Slovakia able get infection control, low fall two waves. case Poland, would also guess delay reporting due Easter. 954 deaths way previous peaks 7-day rolling average. vaccine, lose fucking job?

I know that’s right logistically going happen, Jesus, I’m disgusted essentially either trick people clever marketing bribe donuts happy meal toys whatever get free, life saving vaccination. Grown ass adults. 

Same way beg plead people stay packed bars wear piece fabric deadly pandemic. I’m tired treating morons baby gloves run around whatever fuck want. There’s absolutely zero consequences bad behavior entire time. people suffer consequences ones right thing. I’ve sick since Tuesday. worst I’ve get far night first infected, feel fine now. I’m really scared getting worse. chances feeling fine rest infection? completely speculating idea people passing you, also nervous make someone prone seizures seizures. want people speculating negative things vaccines also write serious complications oh someone scared needles MOSCOW (Reuters) - fund behind Russia’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine said Thursday Slovakia return doses received Russia due contract violations, Slovakia’s drug agency raised issues shot.

The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), responsible marketing vaccine abroad, said shot’s official Twitter page sent letter requesting doses returned.

It also requested batch sent specially-certified laboratory checks, Slovakia’s drug agency said earlier shots received differed reviewed European Medicines Agency (EMA) medical journal Lancet. Fails pay vaccines shipments cancelled, herd immunity? Totally suspect all. Also US holding onto millions AZ vaccines said don’t need probly never use! Meanwhile Europe suffering need vaccines ASAP

Well personally moved closer. Seeking different job good option well find something close by. sounds extreme truly life changing. may long enough ago show anymore even it, tell guess. add this. Biden Administration tried get vaccine makers renegotiate contract export companies far refused. largest CABLE news viewership, even case recently. biggest shows peak 3 million.

Network news gets 20 million. It’s basically prisoner’s dilemma situation, isn’t it? one participant chooses cooperate, chooses fuck first one over, latter gets marbles, even though they’d better cooperation. EU didn’t drop ball such, acted good faith others chose pure unlimited selfishness. Unfortunately post got know long one stay for. Mine lasted almost 2hrs. wish could rational mask mandates/culture, feel like authorities think people can’t handle nuance.

I totally support wearing masks public transit, grocery stores, government buildings. etc everyone vaccinated places want keep mandates while, sure, people wear mask 30 minutes supermarket time being. 

But there’s reason culture/ mandates states dictate wear mask outside walking around outdoor spaces like parks beaches since transmission outdoors minimal. think vaccine really makes impact, masks go away small steps starting outdoors trickling indoor places. UK started giving second doses. Increase amount immune people slowing. 60 million. Yea, sure people cant wait like 2 months, country even harsh restrictions, go restaurants, go sporting events, see friends, etc.

Just wait get everyone vaccinated wants vaccine, open up.

by beginning June, almost 80% adult population vaccinated. left out...😏 Ok? Palestine wanted get vaccines someone else, Israel always variants. I’m sure expect weird religion gets pass. arbitrary. say religion Star Wars Interstellar Lord allow vaccines, exempt? (soon ex) wife went w/ 1 week first dose her...

brought covid house infected 3 neighbors (stopped talk one, talked another, etc)... tested positive Monday, day scheduled vaccine....

what remind people **Started** vaccine, immune... still spread infect others.

wait till fully vaccinated ruin others. it’s anything live fear about, it’s enough reason selfish reckless dummy get vaccinated happen young lower risk. well.... Really? authority I'm referring expert viruses, think applies. appeal authority fallacy occurs someone uses testimony authority in order warrant conclusion, authority appealed expert field question. Genetics Based heard medical personnel know personally, easy shot. prepared, reconstituted takes time normal vaccine. saying rocket science, also normal injection either. You’re coronavirus subreddit *right now*, bro. Yes, essentially demanding someone else read come across somewhat petty, outright disingenuous.

Meanwhile friend works Meijer got vaccine even eligible somehow? variant, known B.1.1.7, spread quickly across United Kingdom Ireland beginning last fall, infectious version coronavirus thwarting restrictions lockdowns earlier helped keep original strain B.1.1.7 ""now common lineage circulating United States,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said White House media CDC warned January B.1.1.7 would likely become dominant strain SARS-CoV-2 — coronavirus causes disease COVID-19 — U.S. end March. Note: really vaccine export, “Be chemicals, equipment, filters hoses: U.S. manufacturers obliged first meet American demand, means slipping list.”

The US prevents countries manufacturing vaccines. Sex rules know, I’m kind getting sick kind language. 

Why always mandating enforcing restricting. wish people would right thing without forced law even consider using brain. 

This isn’t directed you, it’s irritating something like “cover face holes you’re sick spewing germs” become divisive political issue. It’s absurd. Well *YOU* pregnant breastfeeding woman, issue? Couldn’t said better myself. 16+ time get vaccine next 2 months, vaccinated longer take pre cautions refuse get it. Don’t want it? That’s perfectly fine don’t complain get sick it. can’t stand hearing new normal bs, we’re BACK normal months It’s probably new double mutation variant. Yea, what, UK even 50% first dose, 8.5% fully vaccinated, Israel almost amount fully vaccinated UK partially vaccinated. person almost definitely thing have, called vasovagal syncope bit scary reassured actually concern all. pass nearly pass way person every time every injection get matter I'm getting. also passed got first vaccine. concern basically warn person giving injection hand wait 30min instead 15. 

Been doctor before, basically reaction act getting injection medicine shot. said could anxiety even though feel anxious could I'm particularly sensitive rapid changes blood volume either way really big deal medically. lie horizontal pass I'll feel queasy bit.

You let person's experience deter vaccine. almost definitely vasovagal syncope VACCINE RELATED may person people administering vaccine took extra precaution sending ER get checked out. point clarification, Canada's federal government responsible vaccine procurement, roll out. Healthcare Canada, therefore responsibility vaccine roll out, mandated managed provincial government level.

The federal government offered assist provinces vaccine roll out, thus far refused assistance, mainly power dynamics federal provincial governments Canada historically 'complicated'. 

There lot (warranted) frustration pace vaccine roll many provinces. well, others like home province Ontario observably inept leadership repeatedly enact half measures control virus far late offend political base largely corporate lobbyists. Premier made grand point stating December Ontario would ready administer 150,000 vaccines day soon supply dropped, hit 100,000 milestone yesterday despite vaccinating since January point (though supply lower then). 

Ontario administered 60-65% vaccine doses they've received date, lowest percentage province. doubt fact rely 100% imports vaccines impacted rate federal procurement happen, systemic roadblocks multiple levels here. Bureaucracy provincial federal levels Canada typically exact opposite fluid adaptable.  

It's frustrating. Sort controversial. egos indian redditors fragile sometimes described every manager Navient, place micromanages time good heavens problems, cause fault, team leads. Hated working there. Perhaps mind strawman? changing goalposts? 

My entire point get go data article showing increasing number young people severe outcomes hospitals. studies show potential risk increased mortality; question whethere live, tangible data United States showing risk come fruition.

Is hospital census showing us this? Perhaps could see CDC's hospital surveillance, yet update recent weeks: see increase there, even statewide chart shows this, would understand then. point, remain skeptical. insane people blindly believe CDC wrought throughout pandemic. fully vaccinated got okay, someone really anxious needles, really hate new Facebook trend people literally posting pictures getting injected. Superspread cheeks Apparently Walgreens sets second dose 4 weeks initially, regardless vaccine. Y'know. 2000 years ago Jesus told followers inject mRNA vaccine prevent serious viruses. take Covid vaccine flu. take vaccine you’re cured ? 2nd dose 4 weeks after, moderns. 3 weeks after, Pfizer frustrating? information reputable sources clear: Even young risk compared old person, still risk spreading COVID risk get long COVID. 

It's also selfish -- saying, ""well, everyone else vaccinated, to!"" linked four studies, zero articles. infectious + hospitalizations + elderly vaccinated + far younger adults still awaiting vaccine = ? appeal authority fallacy optimistic. part lot people enjoy working office forced socialize people whose entire social life revolves around office. typically people unable perceive respect boundary signals people negatively impacted presence. Herpes 21 great! One challenge people vaccine hesitant. need time, information, questions, etc. That’s primary care help.

Of course primary care help, need appropriate infrastructure (I’m thinking freezers) expect slightly lower rate immunization. 

Multi pronged approaches necessary differing situations doesn’t even begin address people can’t get clinic various physical social reasons. take paracetamol die it. chances low, there’s always gonna something. 1 500.000 people dies taking pfizer example would take back vaccine? Like anything could happen vaccine doesn’t even reason that.

Ohh someone died allergic reaction new chocolate that’s sold here, let’s stop selling chocolate.

You get point. Don’t worry dude, you’ll fine (: fraction cost. Lol Pfizer vaccine I’m glad did. side effects quite mild. hope people realize ""600.000"" means six hundred-thousand places. Hi everyone. wanted ask y'all good 9 eastern posting this? would prefer posted different time day? Lmk!

Then think racism stupidest thing planet 

##we human, race supposed get vaccinated you’re sick all. It’s protect vaccine workers others getting vaccines site. wait. Don’t potentially infect people flu Covid said many people would need vaccinated US achieve herd immunity? 25% people refuse get vaccinated, studies suggested, I’m worried never get there. best argument post-infection immunity (assuming infected all) year old counting. know long immunity lasts, know that, general, post-infection immunity coronavirus infection durable. post-immunization immunity well-studied. You’re making assumptions re: proposed “passports” used.

1) Vaccinate people recovered covid last, already level protection

2) Focus getting everyone first shots vs fully vaccinating everyone. data clear UK works. Lmao genius Oh no, somebody foreign country posted something condescending internet ignored reasons somewhere they’ve never and/or likely don’t understand fully operates little bit differently. awful. retort spelling errors nothing know comeback. congratulations still want gone.  secret now. vaccines get full approval age groups groups currently given emergency authorization? Like get separate full approval younger kids way get separate emergency authorization? simple issue truth politically acceptable honest this. carry Trump administration.

The whole US government needs page make simple clear statements like this:

We return normal number infections US drops low level. order get there, need vaccinate many people possible, maintain simple health procedures (such masks hand washing), take aggressive actions whenever outbreaks. disease spread people, people. community spread stopped two weeks, country would recover. EVERYONE part. dragging long enough people things necessary stop it.

Then simply need crank testing, track infection rates. Simply explain dropping mask mandates, re-opening schools/bars/restaurants/etc still high infection rate simply means everyone else wait longer.

This country suffering self inflicted wounds, needs called out. can't pick favorite hobbyhorse attribute case direction completely without evidence whatsoever. Inbefore anecdotes Michigan. New Zealand negative levels fuckaround comes pandemic 

What's like, sane government? one’s surprise, UK variant dominant strain US. media trying make us panic saw coming people bad risk management. hear anecdotal stories kids issues logic goes window. guess choice, would never stunt child's social emotional growth due fear something low risk. link NY Times article think explains whole situation pretty care actually read post, point transverse myelitis issue safety concern. It’s fact potential safety concern MHRA expedited safety review 7 times faster supposedly comparable regulatory bodies.

It’s dangerous it’s MHRA knew could issue didn’t care enough review data carefully regulatory bodies. 

These regulatory bodies weeks ahead MHRA stopping use affected groups blood clot issue again, MHRA puts safety second distribution first. reason FDA told AZ entirely new trial US seeking approval instead trusting circus UK trial like many countries did. lot side effects psychological. Maybe psyching 15 minute waiting area. failure deliver orders big Pharma continued export product elsewhere.

Which possible idiotic EU decision making. Vietnam's data reliable, might masking lot. case also mild, tested positive too, tired day two...

I chest pains, fever, aches, fatigue 4 days now.... we're mid 30s w/ kids Vaccines efficacy doesn’t seem effected know Vaccine reduces chance contract illness, reduces viral load transmissibility. get vaccine get sick would house wife spewing way viral particles everywhere compared gotten vaccine. looked getting full blood test? , may deficient something like vitamin D, iron, zinc etc

I always getting flu, blood test said low ferritin, Vitamin deficient, take supplements flu since. According NYT contamination detected J&amp;J, Emergent.

So factory completely failed GMP. tarnation? Also AZ Germany limited aged 60, thrombosis issue. thought vaccine still meant could carrier? so, herd immunity. basically arguments made replied insightful rebuttal ""Bullshit"" actually Texas 9 years  occupied Palestinians haven’t vaccinated yet. I’m freshman college student spend entire first year learning home. beyond excited finally somewhat normal experience soon mean, basically shut shop easter weekend vaccinated near one. supply next days.  would higher chance infected “with” vaccine? 

Clearly vaccine reduces possibility! simple question asked attempted use reason answer it- yes wished useful (as all, unless sociopaths), indeed response long attempting fulfill wish/attempt.

You respond attempt insulting me, condescending way that. reason? said nothing insulting you. trying- best could- answer question. also diminish reason ""blah, blah, blah Good grief!"" rather using reason logic dismiss argument. establish truth fiction without substantiative argumentation?

If indeed argument useful, ignore say nothing? Argue it? *purpose* mean return? you? see look mirror? rationalize away fault, despite effort intending useful vantage?

This world coming us neoliberalism sucks every last cent upwards, biosphere declines: post-truth world reason logic even desire treated kindly dismissed individually institutionally nebulous reasons. like science dismissed Japan (and many places) now- like dismissed reason nebulous spite. Well EU certainly naive towards UK US. clear November EU one two exporters left market would influence rollout. Ah yes. Next thing they'll get brightly coloured emblem attach shirt collar. happened first real office job. Even nothing expected seat warmer. flexibility WFH great get done 4 hours would 8 office. charge hourly rate it’s higher side see I’m worth cost. supposed get two shipments around 60.000 Belgium

""Supposed"" who? AFAIK guesstimate government based total quarter deliveries, actual communications J&amp;J. think fine time fall comes around least one vaccine EUA. Based SUKL's (Slovak Medicine Control Agency), discrepancies Sputnik doses delivered Slovakia presented Lancet, sent EMA certifications well doses used already countries. 


Problems include: 


Russia cannot provide documentation guarantee production quality different factories. 
In several cases, appear vaccines different properties (lyophilisate versus solution, single-dose ampoules versus multi-dose vials, different storage conditions, composition method manufacture). 
Apparently Russia ignoring requests documentation SUKL (80% requested documentation missing). 


I think main problem really transparent documentation.   Bloviating business boomer.

That shits eloquent af dude would best put asterisk next J&amp;J's vaccine time being. number adverse reactions vaccination site Denver yesterday, shut site early precaution. [Local news article Lol see infected indians traveling???? fucking hell UK variant (the UK) peaking 70,000 cases per day December several times higher previous peak... got hit earlier countries impacted now, yeah makes sense cases declining point. relevant authority, it’s citing source.  Yeah daughter hospitalized week rhinovirus (common cold). I'm terrified would do. course precedent we’ve never novel virus killed 500,000 people even amidst mass restrictions. That’d like saying alien invasion occurred shouldn’t take unprecedented steps resolve issue. never emergency situation would call requiring vaccine approved emergency authorization. LOL. people highly important positions *that* freaking stupid? get it. worry United States Rona sooner rather later. right, different Facebook almost seems like need separate words two kinds social media. ""More wanted know relatives' breakfast"" social media versus ""strangers arguing GameStop"" social media. Astrazeneca weird. EU supposed get doses two EU factories two UK factories, understood correctly. reason one Belgium factory making doses whole EU supposed support whole world too? AZ took supposed come originally?

And mean ""Australia originally agreed AstraZeneca import 500,000 doses"" ""Australia still owed 3.1 million doses overseas"".  adding conversation? I'm also convinced got Covid last January 2020 flying home, Covid really identified. Wife tested negative flu (she terribly sick) doctor said know wife seeing many cases ""whatever is"" anything else.  None changed mind getting vaccinated soon could - proof tested positive, proof antibodies, either. least tell wife CDC still recommending one dose people tested positive past. since wife proof positive throw second shot good measure. course did. getting 1st Moderna later today. Glad able get it, nervous. RI announcing goal 70% partially vaccinated May 15 discussing reopening past point - events 2,000 people outdoors 500 indoors allowed mid-June... masking distancing still required. Bangladesh steep increase too. I'm guessing referring European nations US deaths pretty bad. know unions basically rubbish (sadly I'm one), turn back them. important note two things - first, militant unions exist, *will* back, fuck around seniority stuff. Second, exercise rights we've granted years years struggle, ruling classes bosses neuter them, take rights back. concede rights willingly, they'd love get back. 

It's good personally done really well despite union, we're lucky, unions support people defend people. done well 'good' times good worker (I assume). boss can't treat badly 'bad' times knows backed organised labour.

Just food thought. Sorry calling fool - unreasonably confrontational. dumbest take seen long time. 

Are comparing unknown side-effects pandemic virus that's killed almost 3 million people world-wide single year chaining children (who incredible metabolisms) ""strict diet exercise regimen""? 


Letting run around play outside plenty exercise yes, imagine parents plowing children fast food junk regular make eat vegetables, fruit, healthy things. Cool. Still getting it. nurse gave shot 20 hour. Hey Dr. 

Do theories people O-/O blood likely mild covid cases?  -- short temper people think still denialist too. logistics harder.
At beginning year clear general practitioner store vaccine safely. last month certain refrigerators sufficient.
Also bringing vaccines vaccination centers directly easier big pharmaceutical distributors pharmacies doctors offices. Seperate tell take Tylenol Advil?  would dismiss analysis completely? Kids reasonably low risk. zero risk. earth wouldn’t want make risk even lower can? current temperature neck woods Vincent? Well that's totally unacceptable FDA-type standards. go without, skip tonight. Pain good. means immune system reacting going overdrive. course pain preventing working choice pop pill.  Really amazing news EU never intended supplied UK supply UK got initial 100 million doses. signed late got less advantageous contract.

The UK initially production facilities, set basically gifted AZ favourable contract guaranteed initial 100 million produced facilities. Additionally AZ given Oxford vaccine I.P free stipulation produced at-cost duration pandemic, permanently less developed countries exchange recieved financial assistance setting production facilities.

The EU contract contradict this, best effort clause speed supplied since signed contracts 3 months later countries like UK, meant facilities later set rushed. (The 3 months later contract meant spent less per dose, since vaccine sold at-cost, basically meant huge costs pushed production facilities supply, lot issues coming since less favourable companies given contracts.)

The EU demanding doses UK utter nonsense trying divert attention away issues. Even every vaccine produced UK *to-date* handed EU, would increase speed matter weeks most, UK would set back months. EU far larger population UK.

&amp;#x200B;

What looks like happened UK supplied Australia doses, likely olive branch since want improve relations commonwealth nations (They tend far compatible ideologies commonwealth countries Europe) sent supply, possible unlike EU, Australia far lower population UK. Oh, people like alright, problem discussion gets distorted companies fiscal influence.

Thats social capitalist societies europe capitalist dystopia US. MRNA vaccine's effective compared viral vector counterparts, safe assume Flu mRNA vaccine created tested see may effective current flu vaccine? I'm disagreeing you, clarifying study findings: ***are risk*** virus

Study: young people ***remain low risk*** COVID-19 ***mortality*** someone suffered fatigue. want point fatigue extremely easy differentiate ""I'm tired"". wake everyday feel rested all, plus hard time staying awake and/or productive. Then, clearly suffering fatigue. read fatigue caused many things, viruses, chemo drugs, auto-immune disorders, bad sleeping habits, much screen time list goes on. Fatigue extremely difficult treat severe person cannot function normally becomes completely disabled. understand logic. realize 1 shot offers ~ 80% protection... assumption antibodies compensation reaching ~95%? Nobody l knows long immunity lasts - vaccine infection - issuing 'green cards' - amount time - both.

I feel like party might short lived. really hope I'm wrong US figure doesn’t include specialists either It'd still issue degree, there's mental health cost social cost telling people can't excited summer even full vaccination. People burnt beaten down. 

We're essentially telling people allowed excited prospect normalcy. cool arguably causes damage anti-science Covid deniers running around development supported paid Pfizer. It’s case. article intentionally vague press conference. Hospitalizations falling city San Francisco proportion cases 30-50 year olds risen. used (at height winter surge) 30-50 year olds 4x cases per month 70+. it’s 10x. Considering massive discrepancy you’d expect see way young people hospital anyway. rights end rights begin. right identify gender aligned sex impact rights. right act vector deadly diseases encroaches right life. free contract deadly diseases. free flaunt basic safe guards prevent spread enter situations expose others. basic safe guards much inconvenience, free remove society whatever capacity needed avoid conflict rights. Perfect. far behind vaxing people?

OurWorldInData -- UK 55 doses per 100 people. EU 19 doses per 100 people. vaccinated half population. Hospitals also ""collapsing"" New Zealand (supposedly) “We’re sure there’s incredible surge, Dunedin hospital gone code black, hospitals across country overflowing, believe crisis,” Hamilton-based Bonning “I national view what’s going on, I’ve spoken number people throughout country, stories Wellington Hospital 110 per cent capacity, patients admitted don’t ward bed go “Middlemore Hospital 60 people waiting inpatient beds department morning, Auckland Hospital, 40 “Christchurch new ED half can’t opened can’t staffed, Waikato Hospital 96 patients 69 bed spaces 9 o’clock evening week two Bonning said incredible pressure leading adverse patient “It’s unprecedented input numbers people turning up, may something unmet need pandemic,” didn’t say Oh bullshit, people vaccinated cases community infection numbers irrelevant. Besides, virus endemic, fully controlling fantasy Europe. reasonable course action vaccinate many people possible move fuck on, Sisyphean efforts ""control"" endemic virus permanently abjectly fail achieve absolutely nothing. There's excuse continuing restrictions majority people vaccinated. decision send vaccines UK instead jumping hoops Europe kept Morrison government’s vaccination program afloat could present trouble Prime Minister Boris Johnson Britain.

They sent AZ UK Government. read book middle school. gumbo may make normal July 4th deadline! old one, keep seeing asked daily threads nobody satisfying answer.

Can speak ADE SARS-CoV-2? concern Coronaviruses? Yeah, study specifically Pfizer, Moderna basically same. Hi! Thanks AMA. posted question General forum, imagine professional opinion would better. 
I went local private pharmacy first shot Moderna vaccine March, didn’t schedule second one time. called week told could come tomorrow. didn’t seem concerned second dose 25 days apart instead normal 28. worried getting second shot three days early?  Anecdotally dad got Moderna mom got Pfizer, sample size 3 think true dad got worst side effects. side effects first shot full range COVID like symptoms second - fever, chills, body aches, nausea, day 48 hours 72 hours out. 

I low fever 6 hours post first shot, next nothing post second shot. mom nausea/headaches post first shot, also next nothing post second shot.

Would genuinely interested science based data supporting idea kids serious vectors/ typically get sick original strains since that’s led schools reopening Brave. also allowed campus college without proof MMR chicken pox tetanus DTAP meningitis. estimate likelihood vaccine escape 2021?

Check kid’s doctor, course. Yeah, accidently backed one step talking case numbers instead hospitilizations.

The article data needed answer questions.

There's articles case counts among young rising, nothing super great. surprising all, though, given vaccination rates among younger folks much lower older folks total case counts constant stands reason case counts dropping among old rising among young.

I'm worried variants dangerous/lethal point. think likely due younger folks letting guard much reason isolate old folks vaccinated. I've always little confused exactly circumstance would cause someone test positive. literally likely way catch covid ? room infected period time (as less 15 minutes probably get it)? indoor restaurants actually safer distanced 10 feet apart another table matter indoors unmasked? masks make huge difference still breathing aerosols omitted long time (say movie theater)? estimate likelihood vaccine escape 2021? Beyond 2021?  good enough predicting future mutations fitness enhancing could make mRNA booster shot uses spike sequence seen wild?

If recently recovered COVID-19 (2 months out), think still right decision get vaccine can? 


My thought process:

Given antibodies last ~8 months people, 
And T-cells last much longer, i'm persuaded wait vaccinate till groups population received form immunity. Yes media garbage, that's I'm US family's India, I'm totally horrified amount misinformation vaccines parents bought into. Using incidents people getting covid getting first shot proof vaccine work, relying anecdotes Facebook news/proof unending fear worry even though 2 days second shot. way convince either, mom gets emotional refuses listen reason scientific arguments. risk management

Being good risk management means understanding odds \*and\* stakes. 

The odds low, stakes charts.  even print odds stakes long term health issues - one knows yet.  

The prize: going movies months early?  wearing mask weeks?  

No one actually smart risk management would ever get bonus round ""fzck around/find out"" purse small stakes high. Legally restricting medical procedures credentialed professionals makes perfect sense. emergancy, understand train random people give vaccines. 

It's got one simplest procedures is. think CNA could 30 seconds lecture hour supervision. Certainly phlebotomist drawing blood something far difficult already, include them?

My state allows dentists veterinarians give them, honestly mind expanding further. Except J&amp;S one shot vaccine, others fully effective second dose. much first dose depends vaccine. data perusal, look journals (we linked TWiV episodes). would say 4 weeks second dose start relax, especially vaccinated individuals. ban exports countries even suppose get vaccine. Look Mexico, South Africa etc. Huh? mean exactly u/askryan stated. 

Who responds GLOBAL PANDEMIC prioritizing rich old? good initiative. Since new variant(s) likely spread young people, important immunity reached campuses order avoid messes like we've seen before. researchers find association pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetes Covid-19 American, I'd happy give away AZ supply rest world. quickly get goodwill, one wants take hands. mistake people making leads believe B117 contagious deadly? changed mind this? would make change mind?

Didn’t EU order late negotiate better price rest world, got it, cost later orders. watch video explanation vaccines FDA set bar 50% efficacy COVID vaccines. 50% efficacy 50% less chance catching COVID non vaccinated person.

bottom line - great - get 90% pretty quickly pfizer/moderna... breathe little keep taking precautions till cross finish. first shot Pfizer today. offered us choice J&amp;J Pfizer. nurse told people overwhelmingly picking Pfizer. Veteran’s Administration health center Chicago. I'm beginning think bribing someone Brazil whatever Brazilian version impeachment worth every $ takes. Thank AMA!

I’ve read articles say Covid mutate far scientists saying Covid may reach limit soon. articles scientists saying need boosters every year different Covid variants- I’m wondering one would correct. 

Also, seems everyday different article states variants may allude current vaccines have, example P1 B-1351 much need worry states vaccinated. side effects 2nd Moderna, chance may experience anything aside sore arm well. You’d suspend debt, freeze utilities internet, provide money groceries, etc. 

To really proper lockdown government would need “temporarily” take industries ever happened SA variant? Seemed like anyone could talk there, suddenly moved onto P1 ""double mutant."" came across [this Sounds like J&amp;J side effects pretty standard across board. Well children's sake hope right, however given extreme lack information studies available impacts Covid children (hell studies still trying argue kids dont really transmit?) unwilling risk children's life long health 18-24 months uncomfortability. Studies linked covid fatigue syndromes. [Link one shows central part affect neural transmitter levels, excitability inflammation/demyelination. Also factors general stress anxiety sleep disorders. easy look commenting doubt. Yes factors related directly caused virus, staying indoors without social contact fear news leading anxiety. doubts also link supporting articles want downvoted, basis speculation. problem is, EU slow sign EU vaccines, vaccines made EU. Unless EU wants seize course. moot point approved would required everywhere required everywhere, that's key difference Meanwhile im waiting EU supose get vaccine around februari march april. EU profits, companies conservative leaders like Macron want protect cost. pushing ""sacrifice"" pharma companies lower chance make even money future, something Macron like can't even imagine! thing Ontario, seems herd immunity much higher number thought, get though Per Cyrus Shahpar US: 3.4M administered, last thursday's 3.36M, 112M least one dose [No, headline original post seem imply something vaccine supply holding show. true seems imply pretty big screw govt.

Of course can't read German, idea article says that. Since made OP, maybe posted summary article critique? No. Overkill potentially cause issues tested. protection least 6 months far still protected well variants, hosptialization death.

Right effective way INCREASE protection get everyone around vaccinated decrease spread. vaccinated people around vaccinated protection extremely high.


This question later year, early next year everyone chance get vaccines things tested. would refered booster. Chances manufacturer test own, mRNA based probably quickest develop test.

If new variants update vaccine adapt variants. might booster shot.

The booster shot might provide protection variants might necessary later. might lengthen protection, issue.

So know highly debated topic, give us expert opinion origin SARS-CoV-2? appreciate sarcasm, let's face it, EU's PR war AZ never getting vaccines, shifting blame, worked spectacularly well them, thanks nationalist gullible home crowd. 

Much crowd appears well. accounts AZ insiders sick scapegoated best pretty telling EU incredibly opportunistic shifting blame. Wonder whether sub lambast J&amp;J manner they'd absolutely willing again, success AZ smearing means even necessary. already enemy blame 100% blame on.  EU commission actually said *100%* AZ's fault, single thing lmao)

Well said. Pick British enemy protect flailing EU's image. worked me. hated surfing ban tho. Every comment like one, essentially implying normality withheld arbitrary unreachable parameters reached directly contributing, maybe even ensuring adequate vaccination coverage reached. utterly irresponsible. many societal changes accompanied COVID-19 pandemic, feel may stay? one then? early April certain things would normal july august latest, damn naive :( fact even know MHRA used data South Africa Brasil well says all. might want stop talking, getting sad. point inexcusable directly hamper vaccination efforts vaccine uptake. I'm sorry, year what, scientists still can't bothered learn basics communication general public? absolutely unacceptable abdication responsibility, held account statements impact. prefer hey country gives choice, blood clots pretty sure happen every vaccine, confirmed happened already 3 think. know plenty people still raising ruckus 10 year old vaccinated even though parents there's *gasp* 10 cases/day. hope I'm wrong companies always free export, they’re filling orders made last year. manufacturing capacity created fill orders made. included vaccines never made production. Imagine impact domestic politics hear county sending billions vaccines development country whose president picking twitter battles 3am. Nobody else ordered them, US government buyer point.

Somehow paid US end 3 vaccines, isn’t obligation offer part production people declined know production scale feasible vaccines work.  ""And killing way kids.""

As suspected, claim nowhere paper. fact, nothing empirical paper except ""In autumn 2020, in-person schooling hybrid models resumed US school districts,3 analyses indicate reproduction number (R) children teens well 1 population level"".

Furthermore, attempt applying logic winter involves ""To assess transmission potential B117 school-age children USA, adjusted age-specific reproduction numbers currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages"".

This empirical, support point. literal junk science. Every single article says said merely misrepresenting fact younger people make higher % cases, logically follows older folks vaccinated.

Waste time. dude give single solitary fuck *Yawns* far know that's many products sure ingested products. aren’t many hotels. Also hotel audited “leaks” “security”, training staff biosecurity.

Every person working isolation facilities extra point failure. Enough points failure outbreaks trigger hard lockdowns.

And somebody tries snarky say “we’re talking diet exercise we’re talking virus” 

No, you’re not. You’re talking long term health effects. brings many variables equation. Hopefully free clear, took 30 hours symptoms hit 2nd shot. to. 

No government proposing businesses required check vaccination status order operate. 

As things stand, vaccines cannot mandated, since they're still emergency authorization. Even they're fully approved FDA, would take act state legislature create kind mandate. seriously doubt kind thing happen (outside possibly requiring vaccine enrolling school, since already established practices place that).

Now, may venues implement vaccine passport able operate higher percent capacity choose check vaccine status. public health rationale behind clear, let know want talk out. nip shit bud numbers children affected tiny shown. realise significant harms children stunting development allowing socialise go in-person schooling? Sold = exported duh true companies. Hence really need change companies get close real worth. misinformation. fraction fraction kids may lose taste undisclosed amount time. Better polio lifetime crippled suppose. Good. fully expect youngest son's college require vaccine next year fully intend help get vaccinated returns home end semester (18 credit hours track practice make easy time scheduling now).

Separately, already required proof getting flu shot returning campus Spring semester year stretch expect COVID shot top flu shot next year. many studies pointing long term issues people contracted covid

Yup. relatively rare. And, importantly, very, apply childred. flu literally harmful children Covid. Shutting schools years certainly harmful children mass.

So someone wants hide away kids another half year top year we've already had, that's poor risk assessment, IMO, likely damage kid way harming emotionally stunting psychological growth.

My kids, luckily, going school socializing entire time (well, since June so). contracted Covid, happened exactly overwhelmingly likely happen children: absolutely nothing. even know told get tested it. No, misinformation. Thank kindly. No, misinformation. got#2 maderna shot went well. sore arm funky feeling, able work fine heat. violation equal rights. Arm soreness far less dose 1 nice.

Basic body achy really tired thing. told wife felt like I'd moved furniture day long day before. Slept good night woke feeling fine. right rain since. wise right now.

If protection implies immune system problem, particular reason think third shot would help; protection taking shot someone else. Either way encourage someone else get J&amp;J shot instead get herd immunity. rare person imperfect protection, far better someone else getting vaccine thus ensuring virus can't spread you.

In future may new vaccine covers different variant. things worked on, none date released. might invited trial thing cases. vaccine approved expect new guidance get it. getting lot inaccurate information.

I conversation HR today returning office. remote position me, great, not, I'll look elsewhere. got emergency approval. Food Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization (EUA) three vaccines. I'm admittedly bit fun mods nuke thread. That's last December. Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson Johnson vaccines approved FDA. company tells need office five days week business wear on, I'm immediately applying elsewhere Okay.

And me, think seems fine. So, again, what's point? Look OPs post history lmaooo heck Coors pure? make regular Coors? anyone know much deadly Brazilian variant IFR perspective? mandating it

Not mandating passport mandating proof vaccines certain venues reopen know it, passport easiest way verify vaccine status! Kindof misleading title there. They're approved EUA. That's meaning they're 100% fully tested guaranteed safe (since takes YEARS long term study), EUA _*IS*_ form approval, suggesting they've met certain minimum standard testing, immediate need outweighs benefit waiting another 5, 10 15 years see long term effects may first. plan planes rest life. always picked nasty cold/flu flying planes past. always wear N95 going forward. sure about.

Seems approved me. neighbor told yesterday. Said wouldn’t commute anymore. Science based data consensus. brother.  Palestinians ask help  got vaccine. delicious. Agree, anyone know vaccine protect long-Covid? know protects severe disease death, long-Covid comes light sickness begin anyway. still get mildly sick COVID vaccinated mean vaccine = possible long-Covid? Yes, true good points. decisions going harder kids vaccinated.

I want kids able play friends too. tough. kids vaccinated worry much. feel bad though. one son circle friends, two families know really well, would meet periodically last year, son included, hard explain COVID bubble know trust really well.

And even then, earlier last summer parent play date set friends, asked going outdoors, said yes. still sent son face mask, picked couple hours later asked inside 90% time. know parent well enough know nice, ill intent, trust gone that. Hey AstraZeneca vaccine 9 days ago. I’m 20 since yesterday evening headache. news came I’m bit paranoid get contact someone? vaccine can't say They'll come around. Cases drop much become silly maintain kind self imposed restriction. Production issues America must compensated somehow guess deliver less Europe compensate. I’m sure states Hamburg vaccinating current maximum capacity eastern. Basically middle school teaching going. Curevac still working vaccine *candidate*. I'm 100% comfortable US prioritizing production actual existing vaccines.  Good. Thos needs happen. problem really need genres social media. video games thousands games needs way categorize it. handful main social media almost every social media would ""genre"" immediately first dose. Emergency authorization required all, therefore legal precedent concept “vaccine passports” condemned governors, though, doesn’t really exist except fear minds base. one proposing that, speaking pandering attacking straw man, usual. New York’s easy system private events use; ones pushing mandated anywhere. places accurately track ""active cases"". really worth looking at. Recoveries reported states, reported consistently among do. Chicagoan, always cute people imply Toronto bigger. Neither lot people. Maybe perfect world, everyone get vaccine, real life, everyone else exists, isnt case. Also U.S. isnt country world every country follows regulations. example, UK didnt approve vaccines pregnant patient's U.S. did. Maybe come reality, see actually listen others say instead judgemental dismissive . Even allowed it, Moderna exporting yet. contract says meet obligations US delivering countries they're mostly ""skin teeth"" realm meeting obligations is. Hey feel second dose? Yea, early. first dose might rough ride plan ahead.  clear laymen terms? 


So many young women worried.... college hybrid learning (non-optional) required vaccinations Christ hope gets reverted. adhd awfully online school don’t want anything person. People keep claiming it’ll “safer”. We’ve entire year college online “safe” covid, want normal college experience deserve. 0 reason vaccinated college campus needs anything lesser normal. fully vaccinated students doesn’t make feel “safe”, safety net never ends. “Well everyone state vaccinated”
“Well kids still aren’t vaccinated” Eventually needs stopping point personal experience confirmation bias lol really divorcing wife talking neighbor? damn.

just kidding, thought I'd pile though Try visiting Vancouver. jealous, knowing close full efficiency. Pfizer. Aside small batch approved use EU, imported AZ EU. nearest trial wasnt 5 hours away, would applied trial kids. I'm hoping Moderna pfizer keep moving forward fast safely can. Marburg facility supposed one biggest world, plans make billion doses annually. Congrats! Got mine days ago, feels like huge burden lifted. I've read mRNA vaccines less finicky manufacture easier scale production. Fucking finally!

My wife got Moderna #1 last month, got Johnson&amp;Johnson week. 

So far, good.

I'm you, I'm hoping developed countries soon vaccinate everyone able send surplus vaccines neighbors allies. Question number active cases US. I’ve using Worldometer look data. average number daily new cases around 60,000 past month. number active cases listed nearly 7 million. Even everyone got last month still it, would 1.8 million active cases. good source? recoveries reported? What’s going here? definitely sucks throw 15mill doses. understand it’s perfect process things happen, mistake avoidable. 

However, hadn’t read EU pay doses. looked again, several articles made sound like Baltimore plant hoping get US approval; deliver doses US. 

So I’d assume US would pay, company would eat cost (their mistake). know EU would pay it? really curious since couldn’t find info myself.  care much vaccinations thanks. Sorry interrupt circlejerk live dude?? im US barely anyone type restrictions. mention they’re ENFORCED. people wanted stay home. Nobody’s making wear mask. Feel free take public. won’t get arrested got Pfizer jab today!! can’t tell family they’re anti-vaxx I’m celebrating quietly Reddit! constantly baffled Germans insist giving round numbers third decimal. mean come on: six hundred point zero, zero, zero? wonder they're over-engineering everything. :-) got first shot two days ago one. got email text night confirming second appointment, center wrote appointment time. seems really weird I'd definitely call back again. first appointment system, relatively easy find schedule second shot. feeling colleges universities extremely cautious fear attacked protecting student body. want show prepared handle worst case scenarios, which, minds administrations, seems permanent pandemic student body refuses get vaccinated.

Obviously case next fall suspect things much open unmasked campuses fall everyone currently expecting. Xenophobes Lighten up. comment asked make think obviously didn’t do. nothing thought felt. number people hospitalized COVID-19 21% higher start province-wide lockdown, ICU occupancy 28% higher (Figure 1). percentage COVID-19 patients ICUs younger 60 years 50% higher prior start province-wide report, issued Wednesday Centers Disease Control Prevention, found — countries — oldest patients greatest likelihood dying hospitalized. 508 patients known hospitalized, 38 percent notably younger — 20 54. nearly half 121 patients admitted intensive care units adults 65, C.D.C. People arriving hospital average, 10 15 years younger earlier patients need medical care contracting COVID-19, said interview ""We starting see unlikely first wave: 30 40-year-olds without previous medical history, people good health,"" Marquis said. “They're seeing doctor, they're taking kind medication, diabetes, high blood pressure — get sick.""

.

That’s eight sources I’ve given y’all. reply (not I’m asking to), observational science isn’t synonymous “anecdotal,” fyi. heck New Zealand open international travel first place well virus? Seems really dangerous so. Didn’t predict April 12th peak Northeast Michigan area that’s currently seeing spike cases? No, health director does. replaced one willing take measures somebody would pursue agenda reopening. made one used support opinion. reasonable concerns, remember, ""slippery slope"" fallacy reason.

My point government probably *shouldn't* interfere vaccine passports. government intervention something describe absolute bad. people's desired ""normal lives"" would involve crimes, instance. Honestly man. I've incredibly patient actually held guidelines well, better going huge parties fall sound like is? They’re empty hotels Government uses isolate arrivals general population other. entire family vaccinated Pfizer, got first dose last week 16 younger brother (16) got day me, parents 2 weeks post-second vaccination, really happy Pfizer tbh.

It’s surreal readily available vaccines atm, last night went onto CVS typed zip code 4 locations popped 3-10 miles me, 2 Pfizer 2 J&amp;J times available throughout day choose from. things going I’m hoping export help neighbors north real soon.  get another AZ shot. happening Nov-Feb period, cases kept going then? really bad. population 10x less. it’s roughly equivalent million day scaled US population I'll definitely anti vax shit. 

Imma 'bout start licking door knobs getting shot! Indeed, sub descended point scoring based nationalism people bizarrely championing favourite vaccine. get second shot Pfizer tomorrow...not gonna lie, I’m nervous. hope get minimal symptoms. Luckily, I’m tomorrow it’s weekend, hopefully enough time recover.

Trying decide get shot left arm switch (I’m right handed, like lay left side). Yeah, cultural peculiarity sometimes makes wonder real German all. I'm way optimistic country, maybe move US.
But think, well, Germany way many perks offer actually that. It’s terrible thing. Oxford/AZ overwhelmingly vaccine helping poorest.

[Vaccine use makes next pandemic likely far longer, deadlier even unequal impact. religion asks get sick covid luxury convenience invalid. It’s speculation lol. found efficacy SA variant 10.4%. would definitely turn AZ vaccine wait opportunity get mRNA Or, know, breach contract happened last week. Easter holidays. Oh, missed error. Yes, meant Israel. case, sure give COVID purpose? Goddamn virus playing Voltron good, might get difficult opened 16 year old can’t say based ease getting vaccinated Santa Barbara county CVS. got moderna CVS 5 miles away, partner wanted Pitzer CVS 20 miles away offered brand. one asked paperwork except drivers license it’s paid federal government. Usually 30 minutes. applicant wasn’t file quickly penciled in. high regard CVS Buelton Lompoc. environment allows social distancing beyond 6 feet desire so. walked empty booth second shot. everyone?  even look hard data? claim ""anecdotal information"" meet personal agenda?

Michigan good case point: That's I'm hoping, too. agree, saying, get tipping point ""most people vaccinated"" ""most people vaccinated"", kids still vaccinated. whole time, believe one reasons kids less affected(aside natural tendency die get extremely ill Covid) a)lack testing kids, but, b)they parents protecting interests. ""Going back normal"" me, means letting kids go play playground kids, unworried getting others sick. ""well, cold"" mentality, me, forever gone, want kids getting this. Waiting til vaccinated seems like best way far. way see close bubbles get every adult around kids vaccinated. makes transmission far less likely. Still perfect though. Yeah...of course always wear mask I'm public around people, last year I've realized heavily rely ability see people's lips mouths fully understand they're saying. I'm going law school fall thought trying learn masked professor, trying understand masked classmates, makes little bit nervous. though? feel like saying ""We woods yet stay careful June go back normal. Let's give lose fight month two everyone vaccinated."" pretty simple statement.

Well, better saying sky falling one day everything gonna fantastic next. Sorry meant herself, implying others Even walking guidance office looked upon weird. interest buying propaganda.

Move along. also want know this. Maybe think it’s lieu tests? So....after first dose, twice hard get COVID? 

but get rid mask go bar? spend time people? Ohh okay, rather silly rule letting it, makes sense. never said course everything worth looking into. also majority vaxxed covid stops putting people hospital never get 100% eradication covid ok. vaccines turn covid cold reduced severity succeeded! Almost every piece social media different. Reddit different YouTube different Twitter different Snapchat. every social media people would use one it. 

Video games also different still called video games guess really hard socially distance toilet public street. strange accusation Vietnam.

What accusation lol.

They control borders better European country. fact. Oh saw suppose start first June little early. dunno couldn’t edged back start July 4, well herd immunity estimates Biden’s goal normal. 

Unless International Leg guess Stop spreading false news: One dose less efficacy two doses, although better nothing. Start one work second. 4 weeks later. I've always thought J&amp;J vaccine superior one really wanted J&amp;J vaccine mainly single shot got Pfizer shot yesterday decline it.  Yes, even research using ""treatment"" COVID-19. True! find helpful UK onto 2nd doses least fast Jan Feb march good pace. Far less first doses given per day though AZ similar me. Got 9am, felt like cold coming went bed (mild headache, malaise etc). Woke sweating unable focus next morning, mostly lifted 5pm. Sore arm days afterwards. clotting. Damn that's really good one.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fever checking worthless. Kind like hygiene theatre. Even Columbia hospital still it. Thanks AMA Dr. Racaniello, love TWiV voice reason past year although wish discovered pandemic! question topic mutations. understand probably endless mutations whole virus go through, possibly evolutionary bottleneck mutations consequence RBD areas spike protein? Also can't help think eventually evolve common cold virus I'm unclear mechanism occurring within virus itself, maybe via ORF protein mutation, built immunity? really combination both? Hopefully got terminology correct, I''m Software Engineer. think misunderstood meant. People Quebec complaining measures pointing Sweden. know miserable failure. false. Peoples antibodies never factor small part population infected. It’s diseases tend come go waves. know couple women whose periods gone crazy post injection.

Tbh, little said although, yeah, periods absolutely *suck* sometimes. Please give best. No, I’m comparing two. I’m talking long term health effects. subject changed. get that. article makes sound like *just* citizens implies non-citizen visitors. thoughts warnings issued 2018 shoddy safety practices Wuhan virology lab? Probably outdoors happen summer. Alessandro Sette studied cells mRNA vaccines found able recognize cell epitopes even variants. Whether cells induced vaccine functional, is, kill infected cells, studied. cell epitopes far less likely change MHC molecules present peptides cells polymorphic. cell epitope changes one patient, consequence next person infected. true thing beauty. Serious question US state Canadian mid 40s get to, obtain covid vaccine? think anyone reservations taking covid vaccine anti vax nut? Bloomberg tracker around 30-35% IIRC, quite yet. Still, well, cheers. also! eas going standard guidlines. story nearly identical post vaccine symptoms. covid can’t sleep night, take melatonin Uh nobody silent Sweden. proven miserable failure simply chose sacrifice vulnerable Tegnell could never admit dead dead wrong. 

Here's deaths per 1M three countries shares borders similar terms economic, demographic, geographical, healthcare/health quality, climate standpoints:

Norway deaths per 1M: 125

Finland deaths per 1M: 156

Denmark deaths per 1M: 419

Sweden deaths per 1M: 1,340

But here's say ""durrr people die anyways"". Unfortunately excess death data also and, shockingly, Sweden's choice sacrifice vulnerable inarguable. Compare excess death Norway, Denmark, Finland's literally (yes, literally) non-existent excess Sweden defenders: Durrrrr Sweden success guys, really!!

You may like numbers numbers, say worth sacrifice people can't also deny choice Sweden made. agree, USA necessarily send doses EU. sure hell stockpile either. US vaccine program track even need AZ doses.

At least send Canada, Mexico, COVAX whatever, let AZ decide export them. global shortage vaccines time stockpile millions doses need using. People scared masks stay home. think people concerned fact going required get vaccine extremely survivable virus. Comparing something like smallpox really fair. Considering doses coming EU probably still stings relying EU produced Pfizer Biontech doses instead? dumb plays stereotypes. terms overall Coronavirus mortality, Israel middling good. terms vaccinating, fast gate, UK quickly catching up. Yes, instead listen random Redditors zero qualifications Hawt Taeks. makes think that?  accidentally selected moderna instead Pfizer cvs :/ Good them, eligible weeks/months ago? wait long? first Moderna shot 3/24. felt fatigued way different normal tiredness/exhaustion, terrible all. lasted two days. mostly sat still, napped, got high watched YouTube. 

A week later trying sleep around midnight lips felt numb could stop trembling/shivering. thought must eaten something bad, gastrointestinal issues food poisoning past. took temperature 98.4, fever. Finally, two hours agony tremors realized - dieting eating hardly sugar. took 10 minutes get downstairs without falling trembling badly. drank entire glass orange juice. Twenty minutes later tremors subsided still racing heartbeat scared, drank another glass 4am. finally slept 530 AM. working theory discovered accident hypoglycemic ingested sugar various forms daily ever since felt better years.  

Why post that? meant cautionary blurb, careful take easy. Yes, vaccines side effects watch things well. Seems pointless, like another one invent anything different. shows governments powerless pandemic besides vaccines draconian Chinese quarantine (that democratic countries probably would incapable achieving) measures truly stop spread. got first Pfizer/BNtech vaccine dose!!! Holy shit I’m relieved almost teared 


My eternal gratitude biomedical scientists developed vaccines ✊ variants taking fit ancestral virus right place right time. agree transmissible. far vaccines work concerned, although monitor them. cell epitopes vary variants cells prevent disease. aspect narrative ignored mainstream media. Still better 90% less lol never anaphylactic shock take blood thinners.

If, observed 30-60 Min.

Source: brought father vaccination center sure accurately compare doses since vaccines different carriers would presume dosage weight mrna alone. Would interested knowing actual number copies mrna would compare. importantly (as someone already received J &amp; J vaccine) :

[None doses ever left plant, lot earlier NYT article*

Or, least, hope none left plant. untrust deepening. Hopefully states go mask-less full capacity much earlier without problem, pressure states same. UK rate absolutely plummet soon Germany rest Europe catch quickly Yes, exactly pandemics work large swaths people decide real refuse stop acting like spoiled children. I'm saying UK boat Canada others thank you! forget saw it, saw somewhere virus mutates much completely negates vaccine, can't really infect anyone. never leave house you’re worried. It’s clear masks distancing longer scientific case realise, we're global pandemic noone causally getting vaccinated. want avoid serious complications death and/ end lockdowns, restrictions social/ economic impacts affect us all. think people UK shocked weeks time Germany catch up/overtake us. German manufacturing powerhouse ensure big problem supply overcome whilst still scrambling produce bare minimum poor domestic capacity 100% effective preventing complications death. completely effective preventing contagion.

Percentages followed actually measuring. Yes. Belgium receive half expecting month It’s crazy. couldn’t edged back fall everything else? I'm sure, could people still go time, thus increasing interactions. argentina shut banks last year opened back days week. lines vulnerable senior citizens around block reduced social distancing. Genius make sense talking ""killing"" virus quite alive begin with? terminology would accurate cumbersome? appreciate discussion. I’m trying see legitimate objections know come sooner later. 

I imagine number people use pretty low. 

One thing I’m thinking allow people cold/flu society people die every year? people forced stay home employers forced pay them? Though often person already passes get sick enough. 

What smoking? Cigarettes kill 40 thousand people year second hand smoke ( 450k itself) it’s unknown weed change this. 

Where stop? 

Again good point. people pushing endlessly kids go back school full time parents want state raise kids ability, desire, talent taking care kids full-time. 

That's breathtakingly elitist attitude. lot parents want kids back school children's mental health deteriorating isolation and/or parents work can't afford daycare and/or kids falling behind academically. that’s strange accusation Vietnam. sources? 

Thailand like first outbreak outside Wuhan, you’re telling Vietnam didn’t single thing? didn't, ""registered"" approved use phase III trials could shout ""First!"". property many virus infections. example, 99 100 poliovirus infections mild, 1 paralytic. percentage asymptomatic infections varies according virus. understand controls obviously deserves study might gain insight prevent viral disease. ADE happens many non-neutralizing antibodies made infection. case SARS-CoV-2 ADE concern.

Dr. Racaniello, thank answer.  I've heard concern among friends family broadly social media. link source could share quote allay fears? know couple women whose periods gone crazy post injection. Happy put daughter that? Same, got this! Time naps :) link sticky discussion post? search link doesn’t play well mobile apps. symptoms worse got Covid Remember herd immunity depends random distributions vaccinated people, non-vaccinated people cluster (e.g. kids school) still outbreaks. Yes, one could go herd immunity level issue. think start seeing infections taper approach 50%. Biden said today wont even consider it, think game vaccine passports. least US AZ (and soon Novavax), Pfizer/Biontech.

And even case AZ, UK relatively dependent imports India. worry, Americans care facts, want keep pretending they're best. Even new strain happens, Pfizer Moderna create new vaccine record time Generic ""background noise"" bloodclots reported people vaccinated three vaccines. topic hand though. concerns raised healthy people developing specific, rare type clotting brain almost unheard demographic. Enough statistically significant. 

I would taken AZ without hesitancy, dismiss ""they bloodclots"" missing crux issue. always Yet got Sputnik doses Israeli government blocked shipment. world didn’t shut economies flu. Get grip. Let’s see time answer any! That’s good list! Vaccine hesitancy flavors

1. I'm risk, need it. I'm young healthy affect me.

2. tested thoroughly enough, could remote risk side effects worth it. 

3. batshit crazy people believe contains microchip/causes autism/is designed kill people. People keep saying can't wait *life return back normal*. However, complete return *normal life* possible point? *new normal* look like near future? reason expect would different. UK country Europe biodefense program. also operated assumption countries play dirty order secure vaccines made sure get promises exclusive delivery investing. 

Germany, largest investor COVID vaccines world per capita, so. Instead assumed international cooperation get go.

There also line, production shortfall.


Furthermore, I'm justifying. explaining. long proponent EU reform establish shared institutions, first time member states face problem realize last minute shared readiness would really really nice have. six months, probably fine, I'd think would unlikely would need then. Cases way down. Same, forecasts Labor Day upset, imagine that! Add government says vaccines change nothing - still mask up, still social distance. awful messaging. Exactly. people say can’t tell who’s vaccinated been...well would apply underage drinking.

If someone isn’t wearing mask, ask proof vaccination. don’t it, out. don’t say “nobody drink can’t tell 20 vs 21”. Ya interesting different people respond. yes, 1 2 days symptoms isnt bad all, took surprise sure. 19 Celsius blue skies NYC. livestream week YT could use questions there. also post now. India democracy. think democracy votes one child policy? happened Speaking - DoFo's incompetence (and allegiance big corporations) cost us. Probably supply-chain issues strong preference. Presumably Moderna may less capacity deliver timelines Australia wants. know what? much know going happen everything lives. I'm going live fear whole damn life. I've covid, vaccine shots, still wear mask I'm going stay shuttered house. Shoot people drive everywhere statistically dangerous too, kids play playgrounds fall get concussions, broken bones *gasp* virus covid. Turn office buildings housing thus lowering rents millions. also teacher horrified read sub. direct supervisor loves home I. wake early, drive 20 minutes find parking parking garage. dept head dying us back office ""team"" again. IDK vaccine affects chances getting long covid still manage get sick, since prevents/lessens chance getting sick first place, greatly reducing chance end long covid sense.  boss mentioned company WFH Monday Friday, office T-TH. LOVE idea. must person sick working alone home staring computer 8 hours   50/50 chance point going abused. Guaranteed! travel right domestically without vaccine. I'm going trip next week actually. enact requirement couldn't. carrot something take away offer back. could understand things like sporting events like actually stopped. Sure, get that. Realistically though. used things like person grocery shopping things actually taken away big deal.

I plan getting Johnson Johnson vaccine officially approved. hope none happens then. Even likely take part vaccine passport systems even vaccinated. Idk, folks thread feel opinion correct one people feel differently confused errant way.   Exactly. FDA forces companies voluntarily recall entire lots “bad batches”.  publish explanation consumers explaining batch “bad”. Feds can't require EUA vaccine, think Feds anything fully FDA authorized. Good luck Thank you, grab tomorrow told needed come back office end month. Next week end 11 years company start new perm work home gig. tried getting tested POTS I've experienced symptoms soon pnemonia 2019. doctor pretty much told pointless get tested there's nothing ""treatment"" sodium intake stay hydrated. fuck downvoted here? NYC population density 28.3k people/mi^2. LA next largest 8.4k. seems fairly obvious city that's packed together nearly 4 times tightly heavily impacted infectious disease. 

Looking restrictions concluding they're nothing, worse fault high case numbers, dumb take too. states tornado shelters tornado deaths. States strictest water usage laws also face worst droughts. Would also decide nothing get rid them? speak doctor. trust reddit medical advice! Provide source overblown flu virus. actual scientific source. Go ahead, I'll wait. going to, literally everything said provably wrong, way calling flu virus. Different family viruses, chief.

I'm willing conversation whether dangers covid overstated. willing tolerate absolute idiocy comparing flu.

After get tired looking scientific source, check deaths U.S. 22.9 percent 2020, roughly 574,000. means 22.9 percent **more** people died 2020 average. Find flu season (other spanish flu, one saying worse 1918, mention fact comparing two bonkers even know flu virus 1918) worse that. I'll wait. Relax tankie :) differ Texas, Georgia, also ended restrictions major international airports?

Feels like something don’t understand. Maybe warming weather southern states makes big difference? US' numbers per capita same. difference one three adults US vaccine vaccinating basically one percent population every day. Canada yet.

But understand why, I'm vaccinated go Canada. anywhere. give shit, I'm gonna get it. I'll go Michigan BC Rwanda, cares.  happens, slowly living cost said country also rise one day paid job rather live, think good thing? Unfortunately Florida’s state government, federal government’s laws overrule state law. would like see Florida’s government take university requires vaccinations; plenty worthy lawyers ready take case.  Business owners know aren’t necessarily cutting salary people move lower COL, they’re going give large increases (if planning to). They’ll also start hiring lower COL areas, you’ll see downward pressure high COL salaries. pay 100k someone LA pay lot less someone somewhere else? expect see bunch shuffling normalizing next 5 years. Awesome people still worth paying highly, average folks won’t able command top dollar happen live expensive place. 

Then time tell. could create local jobs overseas jobs together. Employee lives China employee B lives US Zoom together.

Employee borrows local office China, learns English local teacher. Employee creates demand Chinese local jobs. Employee B borrows local tech guy help Zoom, learns Chinese manners local teacher. Employee B creates demand American local jobs. 34?! want normal human interaction again. person 85+ years old 8700 times likely die covid child, 870 times likely die covid someone 20s.

This means would vaccinate 870 people twenties save number lives save vaccinating one 85 year old.

The risk dying increases dramatically people age utterly overshadows risks people due overweight medical conditions. look literally country world ideas different leader would handle better Bolsonaro. only? they're telling damn lie. anyone think burn churn office good? telling damn lie.Why fuck go back normal. Think this: we've proven jobs can, must option things remotely. End story. company prehestory see that, maybe going business would good thing.I know many gate keeping asskissers lied this. That’s fantastic I’m happy sure whose plans actually changed this. Non-Canadian ""travelers"" generally able enter Canada year without family ties essential work. Texas 5 13 populous cities country. 

Those cities still mask mandates. Hey, send vaccine California then?  B/c medical provider says time enough stuff meet demand. 

Being eligible good can't schedule appointment. People downvote anything, including talking downvoting. That's inconsequential part internet.

In experience, pretty much go way decide stay communities crappy member base. pretty easy figure crappy people aren't. Avoid bad places, pay attention good ones.

Eventually, start recognizing folks crappy.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  seem matter trials. That’s did.  Yea, blows. Moving 815sqft apartment I'm gonna feel like king.   Texas 5 13 populous cities country. What's going there? Furious. people communities (mostly) right other, scientific teams top notch; meanwhile govt fucking around like kid ADD, bouncing one thing next driving everyone nuts. get risk posting social media? identifying information publicly available. find blank card high resolution online. missing something? eventually leads promotions. Sandbagging help long run. 2 jobs ago worked... 6 months later fired bc things wrong one told me. rebuttal ""that's training got"" think kids checking cause realize much consequence nothing? sister teacher district still plans pass kids participate next grade. would play video games day job still sent paycheck even work. quick glance comment history tells would course think requiring people baseline knowledge engaging certain acts would authoritarian.

Fact world far better requiring people drivers license operate motor vehicles, passports travel internationally, vaccinations put tens millions children classrooms, credit scores banks financial institutions know they’re potentially giving access money, etc..  know level detail, regulation exist industries according .gov resources glancing earlier. try avoid talking completely booty, often double check memory/claims commenting; missing Canada nothing prevent booty talk 🙃 simple. need overcome vaccine hesitancy whole country reach herd immunity. Vaccine passports may one ""carrot"" could help that, letting people things love get vaccinated.

I'm saying vaccine passports perfect, probably mandated. neither banned. private business wants fast semi-reliable way make sure everyone 5000-person event vaccinated... that's actually pretty good idea, government likely interfere.   much live Northern State nothing shut down. travel seen businesses shut months. I'm sure certain areas business closed America open. get pay for. think Americans won’t thing? Oh, see. answers previous question. think general people Japan don’t care worried Covid? I'm living county eligible people want wait yahoos let allotment go waste.

Infuriating. would rather squeeze vaccine back arm drink Coors Pure. worry approve that's enough USA people. Lolololol Aight, good know then, thank bit education. mitigate risks damn time, particularly required effort minimal, like requiring seat belts. Masks cost little takes little effort wear one. flu comparing flu disingenuous. Amazing many selfish people want deal inconvenience masks little longer keep others bit safer.  typical office type jobs? case “unhappy people talk jobs”. ask manual labor jobs (shipyards, refineries, offshore) norm huge part work force. friends husbands get pretty great bonuses/raises types jobs, friends working office jobs don’t. 

My husband manual labor (HVAC), consistently gotten $1-$2 raise every year. bosses come help employees call holidays. It’s absolutely wild me. buy everyone’s kids Christmas presents. literally nicest people. got Covid work covered sick days, also sent rouses gift card someone could grocery pick us.  Great, Tel Aviv nightlife return? yet? Fob keys tied worker ids sign system would probably ideal unless lockboxes secured behind least 2 entry points. call bluff. guarantee majority told. people react drug mild moderate reactions. particular patient reaction severe almost called code. yet review still decided recommend vaccination. proceeded get vaccine weeks later without problems. know anything outside chemotherapy can't speak types PEG reactions. want believe comment satire/trolling, referencing fact can't Israel-related thread without ""bUt pAlEsTiNe"" shed tears, even news like this. People don’t want work still want get paid. don’t say! There’s existing productivity sleep nutrition important following 2nd shot? example, took Pfizer 2nd shot bad sleep ate crap like McDonald's next 1-2 days, would reduce effectiveness vaccination?  jobs out-source-able now, out-source-able before. Working remote won’t change anything. This. extra hour sleep amazing quality life improvement. flexibility family time made life feel good times it’s going really hurt go back way things before. 
I would love hybrid schedule, 2 days office &amp; 3 days home. Would feel like fair compromise. really one life's saddest realities.   quite literally skip job ads I’m qualified located downtown. 

I would much rather get paid 10% less get train station somehow, get train walk 4 blocks work. Fuck that. 

I much prefer getting car garage, listening music drive work, pull parking lot go day. people don’t really call Spanish flu anymore

Almost everyone does.  must explain Michigan spiking Ohio, Indiana, Illinois aren't. maybe I'm speaking soon, rest midwest follow... think so, rate vaccinations. jobs 100% person.

The vast majority jobs require present way. 25-30% US workforce WFH minus 1/4th already back office. It’s much easier quit collect welfare. One reasons aren’t Uber drivers anymore government pays work. I’ll believe see Israel least three lockdowns. could achieve Herd immunity U.S. July Congratulations! Excited you! People seem forget sheer size US terms land. One state large area country continents. arm hurt much first Moderna shot it. Second shot sore nowhere near first. bit headache fatigue/muscle aches mild. Tylenol nap much better. Also US holding onto millions AZ vaccines said don’t need probly never use! Meanwhile Europe suffering need vaccines ASAP No. Palestine completely different entity. Oslo accords makes clear PA responsible matters healthcare including vaccination efforts West Bank arabs majority world - Oxford dominates COVAX scheme curious play fact they're still going requiring masks major deal breaker some

You stay home scared masks. Well proof vaccination. Seems reasonable. safe fully effective halting spread. wonder students fully inoculated ditch masks campus in-person September Looks like media trickle truthing people fact 2P stabilized prefusion spike better vaccines produce wildtype protein It’s PAs responsibility It’s PA’s responsibility ""Wellenbrecher"" lockdown, ""harter"" lockdown, may get ""Brücken"" lockdown form lockdown (not really btw) since November. NY MI Oslo accords, governing treaty West Bank, PA liable healthcare matters including vaccination efforts West Bank know 15% convalescent figure reached? confirmed cases recovered, probably substantial number people exposed either never got sick got sick recorded. Imagine Justin Trudeau something like that!? ok OK FL well Personally wouldn’t go back school unless vaccines required.  I’ll take 3 1- Parents behavior keepers school day. 2- grades don’t mean much. 3- Many kids actually working jobs. 4- Straight apathy. 5- Mental health issues holding kids back without proper supports person. 6- Family needs care. 

It’s long list. things going decades areas public doesn’t give crap about. japan [extremely bad flu numbers extremely high begin with.

As ""compelling evidence"" badly they're undertesting, go look testing per capita yourself. They're even worse poorest countries world. Orlando. Tons walk in/drive availability. Unknown, Oslo accords PA liable vaccination efforts there, health ministry hasn’t open numbers no, know totally secular people force fed Facebook decline vaccinations. asked simple question person feels overall sentiment towards COVID Japan. response reads like dying opportunity lecture someone show internet much think know human beings. Blah, blah, blah Good grief! guess people predicted bad actually going be, highly pessimistic made one correct people early on.

But continue correct looking data, simply always pessimistic everyone else.

And colorful language uses ""category 5 hurricane coming towards shore"" makes think he's attention whore. ban citizens temporary measure,

India's cases going decrease 4 weeks. like ""temporary"" measures introduced last year around world, extended. Makes sense. That's exactly it. really difficult try give pelt optimism without everyone dropping guard early. know people really bad commutes would rather wfh work home. don’t blame all. think hybrid model would best.

In case, still stuck virtual whiteboard sessions. chicago everyone seems wear mask? neighborhood. 50% best. Eran Segal stopped posting Twitter. guess took deserving break spend time family. point wrong. trials weren’t big enough reveal side effect all, let alone tell us anything whether it’s equally likely first second dose. 48% Covid-19 deaths India people younger 60, 10% deaths aged 26-44.

People going stop reporting “US cases!” look regional, regionally places hitting herd immunity pretty soon. roommate risking bringing variant Cali.

STFH. downside companies see nobody wanting work office, salaries likely also equalize nationally. live NYC LA need $200k get by, suddenly jobs pay like $75-80k need live near work. interesting reached herd immunity without vaccinating kids. listening Dr. Fauci?

Also interesting see 84% eligible population getting vaccinated. higher polls show US, guess see. cant deny entry citizens permanent residents, ever. wouldn’t work unless become requirement board flights.

To use point, we’re testing less we’re going get fewer confirmed cases. look positivity rate extrapolate what’s really going on. Uhh no. seen come many times. One medical expert, rando news website?

If take vaccines spin into: ""it's big issue want become dependent outside forces"" political base, unrequited air drops would likely count act aggression spark conflict. Come man! Even doubt deliberately. Poor guy probably thought making omelette. start, yes, vaccinated point deaths percent trend towards zero. 80-90% focused 15-20% population largely vaccinated now. Well, herd immunity threshold covid 19 60-75% yeah, math adds up. US 7% population recovered. 

The US 32M cases. That's roughly 10% population. real rate probably twice that. ...you realize complete 14 day quarantine regardless right? people read guidelines pretend smart computer day? much hate Bolsonaro, BrunoofBrazil telling truth spike. holiday, expected record Tuesday.

About downfall though, I’m confident. Also, USA UK (and much developed world) older population, higher death per million expected them. Well dad officially came crazy person who's refusing vaccine believe covid real. Basically arguing everyone who's gotten vaccinated cancer 10 years. Also apparently fact africa get hit hard COVID proof US making covid numbers...

Heres thing, people who've vaccinated punished choose be.

In home state Wisconsin, rapidly approaching point anyone wants vaccine get one fairly easily. looked online today found available appointments across SE Wisconsin Walgreens, CVS, ascension hospital system.

6 weeks hit point anyone easily get vaccines, things need open people who've fully vaccinated. others choose protect themselves, that's issue. That's case lot people worked retail service covid. Factory labor barely breaks even unemployment. supplemental unemployment payments fed 15/hr (600/week). pay workers enough. CDC vaccination tracker currently NH vaccinated 101% senior (65+) population. That's truly amazing. 0.00003% population, even deaths. horror! fear-mongering finest don’t think trust US “recovered” numbers.

There way still 6.8M active cases, since even averaging 100K per day, would mean one contracted COVID last 2+ months recovered?  Thank that, lockdown since many weeks two days lockdown ends. too. least good world see carnival feast, religious demo-theocracy where, even though collapsing completely Covid, still discusses whether churches gyms (but schools) remain open.

Bolsonaro idiot, represents good amount Brazilians well. many examples idiocy don’t even know start... Two days ago, popular striker huge soccer club got involved car accident. diagnosed day Covid 2nd time (reinfections common here, give herd immunity). many countries would get probably arrested knowing virus still isolated, got criticism. Welcome Brazil. Thanks sharing experience, I've little nervous second shot sounds manageable. I've two kids like know get anything anxious brain. BRAVE. Denmark done dumb shit too, really gives feeling ”Do guys actually know guessing well”. It’s off, time first shut everything suddenly open everything time closing everything again.

It’s like... Maybe services same? I’d imagine Supermarket doors open thousands customers per day, surely small local store also 1 customer store time. Nope, close everything. Oh except big supermarkets, continue.

Maybe also shouldn’t opened bars immediately first lockdown. Oh did? Oh set time limit bars close midnight? That’s good, covid arrives 0:01 everyone knows.

It really makes scratch head. guess industry comment filters lot jobs Get rid AZ don’t need drama associated it. save lives elsewhere deployed now. agreement Hebrew, assumption volunteered IDF. Bruh could hardly lift arm shoulder height solid two days got first shot, almost comical. lift fairly often too, I’d anticipate legs day tbh, knows everyone reacts differently Whats constant use adjectives like breaking point collapse. saying deaths go little more, hospitals capacity going down? think so. capacity, able treat everyone.

Congrats vaccine! Best luck.

#2 people arnt (or dont appear be) morons far right covidiots. [Yes, called weeks ago. We're going flip vaccine shortage surplus hurry, happens, whole message going change sudden.

They'll start creating pop-up vaccination sites grocery stores public places vaccinate passers-by. able pick vaccine along latte morning. Definitely. hit legs day dunno, something think specifically.

(if job allow wfh)  thoroughly studied. Best heard listen body kill right around vaccination. Thanks info lord hamster. [The] first results clinical trials teens started come in. last week, Pfizer announced vaccine far safe children ages 12 15, said plans seek emergency-use authorization age group “as soon possible.” Others follow. “For adolescents, vaccines probably available fall,” estimates Paul Spearman, director infectious-diseases division Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. “For younger kids, it’ll probably early impending rollout vaccines children important protecting kids needless suffering, pediatric vaccination save lives age groups well. many places, adults delaying vaccination, surveys show one-fifth outright refusing it. large numbers people continue latter mindset, vaccinating children central hope reaching herd immunity. thank perspective culture there, one things appreciate getting reddit. 

re: ""might choose live there"" - bet Ya, really think restraint going end this. Might save lives, might not, vaccination end game. get point vaccine widely available demand low, mask mandates go, right? Anyone chooses get vaccine gets infected stay like forever protect them. required work places YET. work hospital chain (a medical college), FAQs carefully worded no, vaccine required 'at time'. like fifth time I’ve seen variety press statement. Honestly. EXACTLY! case long time. MMR. Combination virulent strain may effect younger people, slightly slower vaccine rollout US, people Canada giving see life slowly return normal US (without realizing done high rate vaccination US). Make Israel Wasrael \#CautiouslyButIrreversibly Yeah part problem Denmark allowed choose one want actively. allowed say ”No, one” sent back line wait next offer. right, choose starve. enlightened you. tons federally funded mass-vaccination sites look lot closer OP talking small local clinics. FEMA even operating directly - places like [NRG Houston give 6,000 vaccinations day. think accurate say 'plan' switched away that. opening time. 

Of course, can't _only_ place vaccines given. lot people USA live close enough concentrated sites; need big small order make sure everyone gets shot. get choose vaccine take though. wait longer, exposes continued risk getting covid dying. think right now?

Don't get wrong, use facebook, twitter account end-around uploading screenshots switch computer, social media too. Back variants started circulating, term ""novel coronavirus"" frequently said separating one coronaviruses. current variants ""novel""? new considered novel (for example - novel enough vaccine work?) That's literally said original comment. said expect US better Canada within week so. look UK know expect Canada. Currently UK variant prominent following vaccination strategy. Hate say I'm happy I'm one though. Herd immunity based natural R number.

If natural R number covid around 4 infectiousness us living lives normally, hard immunity requires 75% population immune.

That way, average, four people might infect, 3 already immune, can't get sustained exponential growth. still get flare ups.

So know achieved herd immunity go lives normally without massive spikes infections. likely R number hover around 1 quite awhile low numbers infected. assumes AZ vaccine available, obviously not.

I think perfectly reasonable young healthy person rather wait get one better mRna vaccines. think systematic racsim dominating Israel society development nation kidding yourself. mean say basically... know company work considering implementing hybrid schedule going forward, get 1 2 WFH days 3-4 person days. 

My job can’t entirely remote (I’m biochemist works biotech research lab), need office/lab run experiments not. 

WFH nice kind struggle stay motivated get work done sit couch watch TV. I’m work I’m “work mode” I’m home hard time saying fuck I’ll stay longer next day I’m office. Thank you. Same. I’m also married healthcare worker know mental load spouse takes thanks too. Well they're pretty immune, reinfections quite rare. government thinks they're immune enough get ""green passport"" vaccinated people. quote “the open borders fault people”. never learn unfortunately. (humans general) arrogant self centered.

People seem grasp newer variants (like widespread UK variant) much transmissible. basically like whole new virus compared we've dealing past year. vaccine MASSIVELY reduces spread. failure public health authorities/ news sources communicate public one biggest failures entire pandemic. 

Scientists always say “they don’t necessarily reduce spread” there’s huge preponderance evidence proving does. shouldn’t talking public terms, ordinary people don’t talk like that. messaging “the vaccines probably reduce spread, would shocking didn’t, absolute confirmation recommend masking.” emphasizing that? Isn’t case vaccines? Back +2! Maybe there's hope human beings yet! understand why, I'm vaccinated go Canada. anywhere. give shit, I'm gonna get it. I'll go Michigan BC Rwanda, cares.

Can't fear monger people think safe. gotta tell safe. don’t need anyone’s permission lockdown. People aren’t forced go outside Brazil. really says something state world today need come clever messaging strategies convince people get vaccine... virus, literally caused pandemic changed life people.

Here's message people: idiot, get vaccinated. It’s article New Zealand. else would referencing Reddit reason decided wearing masks going normal society ended whole pandemic Japan. Meanwhile covid almost silently spreading there. Around 60% Pfizer/BioNTech, 30% AstraZeneca, 10% Moderna. get antibody test. &lt;Only way variant escape immunity completely changes spike protein it’s longer virus affects humans

Lol, need check biology 101 Moderns done decent job too. Granted mostly sold US far. Agreed. I’m making point metrics can’t always track real output employee, much defined job duties accomplish don’t always show good job. also EU export blocking shipments AZ Australia anyway, means enough AZ young people might well use something else circumstances. 
  hope point find one comfortable with. apprehensive J&amp;J seems simple enough get Pfizer/Moderna series instead, difficulty US least would finding site knew vaccine scheduled.

Take care! really Mumbai? lockdown Mumbai lot nightclubs 10pm dude. literally need permit even move around day. sure comment belongs here? give sterilizing immunity. term prophylaxis vaccines comminly used since 2015. Fine

It starts dude naked park getting lonely complaining management. countries rich, isolated island nation 5 million people. opinion huge difference company committing deliver 100% ordered doses Q2 like J&amp;J company deliver less half, like AZ. 

Pfizer Moderna also weeks delivered less, long compensated later quarter, delays must expected opinion. also useful look risks things accept lives put things perspective. example, according google search, 1 100,000 healthy people could die general anaesthetic. People take risk essential surgery non-essential cosmetic surgery time. take risks dying/ harm every day life people scared whatever media. understand concerns lot people benefits outweigh risk. locking down. president continuously worked local efforts downplayed problem, denied existence.

I'm sure understood comment. teams playing within division, possibly 7 total teams including Canucks. Still absolutely unacceptable, league wide. Europe massively producing vaccine, used vaccinate UK US **Old Rich White Man Teaches Black Woman Social Dist. Getting Face** Thanks introspection Kaiser record said administered “clinician student”. It’s rocket science, anyone limited training this. diagram

Is like Venn diagram Jewish? didn’t even mention NZ.

If assumptions problem you, suggest stop making others first. Well, suppose? I’m generally quite aware put body also comes ”normal” drugs it’s bit difficult ”throw myself” feel like idea it’s available short time. state cases flat 4 weeks. percent positive gone 1%. amount testing lowered focused. would expect % positive go cause resources given vaccine governor said many times said health department watching data long cases flat won’t alarmed percent positive since it’s expected go testing focused. 

The question have: testing people exposed showing signs covid percent positive 6%? Shouldn’t like 60%? (I really don’t understand testing people sick exposed high percent positive) 

What’s even crazier like 40% daily cases assumed people tested. 6% time assume covid test correct many assumed tested cases really cases?

oh noes risk would *2 million now*! That's basically death sentence! thing years passed multiple times. eventually gave route it. go float juvenile wisdom perseverance universal pathway success somewhere else. found another route happy it. I’m kiwi I’m sure it’s completely relevant would like share anyways. 

A family mate stuck aus, well Tran Tasman bubble opened day, allowed come back due terminal cancer patient. I’ve tried argue unfair hand going need quarantine would difficult hospital visits need keep treatment. citizen wouldn’t allow it. guess sparks whole chat dying ones last wish family friends gets denied government. 

She come back November still alive cool, feel plenty people stuck abroad —- completely agree years’ gap everyone try get back good health/can afford quarantine good reason come back. 

I really don’t understand last minute mentality NZ citizens abroad, healthy KNOW government wants help people get back feet procrastinated. produce vaccines, need decide share others vaccinate population. Thanks! frustrating part also there’s constant stream information it’s hard keep track latest.

I thought children going vaccinated well now? Thought pretty recent announcement this. they're anything like people know got covid, think they're immune now. live gf that’s her. took lot time get appointment asked gonna same, attitude like “eh, I’m going crazy get one. wanna try get one I’ll take it.” pretty much to, want us get back normal. since technically approved people say cant mandated (under EUA) realistically speaking court would even take case. Joke want, know you’re mocking children women men killed, thrown homes starved Zionists. Well. Lockdowns work. Everyone following pandemic see that. great see divergence previous patterns care home vaccinations increased rapidly end December/beginning January. timing suspect due decrease holiday gatherings idk.  downvoted Thanks! 😊 thank you!  would get pleasure that? People die Covid matter live. Show humanity Bubble last year remarkably well keeping COVID out, playoffs. they've restricted play teams division limit risk transmission, outbreaks. Weebs idolize Japan. perfect utopian society idiot ugly stupid Americans strive emulate. I'm sure there'll endless angst towards USA better rollout EU, demands US hand home-produced J&amp;J supply.  
 
Oh wait, course be. They're petty desperate Brexit Britain embarrassing them. "" understanding vaccine mainly reduces symptoms necessarily stop infection/spread""

This incorrect. 

From CDC: "" growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection potentially less likely transmit SARS-CoV-2 others Competition natural free market. want force production demand? work. said, market settle fewer options long term suspect Oxford one losers here. two kids husband everything work home longer loves home withe them! baby January 2020 first steps first word ""Dada"" precious moments happen again, wants that. I'm shocked parents complain home kids....why people kids want around them? 100% agreed evidence vaccinations reduce transmission (people swabbed vaccination much less frequently positive, positive lower viral loads). Early data this, unfortunately sometimes 'we know' got understood 'vaccines affect transmission all.'

You getting vaccinated would helpful since certain groups (such children 16) can't get vaccinated, would help protect them. 

It's definitely frustrating, science never going 100%. can’t traditional medical personnel doctors offices.

In principle right. However, lot people thrust family doctor unknown government doctor sitting office top gigantic stadium firemen injecting one vaccine 2 minutes. 

Big centre great, option discuss vaccine doctor help people reluctant vaccine get it. Mixing human viral vector chimp viral vector sounds like origin Batman archenemy. internet mistake. 

30 years ago father would way getting bullshit information. freedom. Whaaaaaaa!!!! flu vaccine depressingly poor results, 50% people take 30% effective. We'll lot better that.

A clinic near randomly walk-in vaccinations Easter weekend spread word mouth, someone knew owner posted Next Door people showed up. know people went Saturday, tried Sunday completely mobbed hundreds people waiting 4 people giving shots. lots demand walk-ins currently. That's things work.


If got shots, relax, fine could statistically be. Right. areas middle-class, working-class people live. live relatively rich neighborhood. Lots entitlement. makes sense. states lifting mask mandates actually well statistically. It’s possible keeping constant moisture front face might actually great policy fight Covid California already lowest positive test rate Newsom talking complete normalcy June. we’ll see. Problem AstraZeneca European counties received little communication expected doses

lmao. desperation re-writing history, I've ever seen it. months EU tantrums entirely warned far enough ahead, huh? Sure. That's EU complains AZ missed targets 24/7, warnings? despite making literally difference since there's nothing done delayed shipments, regardless told it.  
  
EU tantrums shifting blame save political careers, plain simple. particularly naive Europeans around spend day, every day sub defending politicians screwed over, deeply sad pathetic equal measure. plant one issue, article non-news piece basically saying ""due one issue production needs double checked"" new absolutely discussed clear actual issue.

The article post make seem second issue, reading article indicates not, needed hot take. coming weeb perspective. know Japan seiyuu (voice actors) record groups, like western animation pre-lay recording animates based recording session. honestly shocked reported cases seiyuu getting COVID. Meanwhile Funimation, largest producers English dubbed anime still VA working home like since middle last year. Keep laughing reddit cronies ""free time"" lEtTiNg bOsS kNoW fAst rEaLly work. boss people see someone care enough trusted responsibility; care checking box play internet. waste talent. 

Between summer jobs 10 year career, consistently asked work proactively helped others finish complrte tasks faster expected. promoted times remember.

If I'm clock they're paying work. promotions happen day ask work, happen; work responsibility happen reward.

Have fun downvoting me! would know percentage needed reach herd immunity? seems like nonsense title me. Another fake moral superior Canadian wrong facts usual. Can’t understand facts come negative precious country. Wake , US handling vaccine stage exponentially better. Poland turning disaster. Many people don’t go go hospital stay home die aren’t enough doctors nurses. also room hospital sick people.

Poland basically becoming next Brazil. What? care business? Far mate! really perspective think. 

And don’t understand comparison healthcare professionals, point is, easier practice social distancing terrace. really afraid good spring weather still everything closed, majority students cities like Amsterdam Rotterdam don’t longer follow guidance. least controlled environment still way manage people. give name dob prove lived/worked county. Israeli antivaxxers continue post nonsenses social media regardless data shows. current numbers, argument now:

1. decline Israel nothing vaccinations, countries experiencing decline well. list countries shrank lot past weeks, bringing mostly Portugal.

2. huge coverup real mortality figures, thousands people dying vaccine. Cite please. people don’t think younger age groups death likely worst outcome, everything else: long covid long lasting symptoms seem come bad cases covid. It’s Americans safety whether want tell . Gotta love fake moral superiority non Americans cases recently exploded Poland? death count low high case numbers Indeed. public leader response pandemic say ridiculous shit like help. message ""we fucked"" one comply. fucked - shit June practical matter. amount downvotes show cancerous idiotic reddit is.I also pro vaccine one forced get it. left vs right, republicans vs democrats, freedom. vaccine passports... almost like nazism ""papers please!"". seems like America turning communism/ socialism(both thing). sad. Nobody stopping individual locking themself down. That’s accurate lol saw happen lockdown 1 since dont think every store. really  So, according newspaper Moderna published morning people immune 6 months 2nd shot say ""it gives us confidence protection vaccine offers"".

Is me, 6 months extremely short? unfair expect vaccine would provide longer protection/immunity ""natural"" immunity (e.g. contracting virus)? people work service industry overworked healthcare professionals? get luxury outdoors? Maybe negativity due 3 people I've lost covid dozens friends family gotten ill (many long covid) plus fact 12% population vaccinated. former partner twice contacted today hair falling out. We're hoping vaccine help long covid symptoms yet qualify one. government consistently shown care businesses people complaining effects Covid. Try ((R-1)/R)/%efficiency) excited get vaccinated last night disappointed realised vaccination isn’t MK-ULTRA type program giving free drugs. 

Oh well. Thankfully don’t feel like shit today. Poor usually means uneducated

I see immediate physical danger mass movement like Jan 6 right now. could always sign newsletter, I'm allowed link here, point I'll write properly.  50% population infected, r=.5, next week you’d conceivably another 25% population new infections. r value way 1, still fuckton cases. Sure, eventually you’d see new cases, case count goes way high, r value would go way lower, that’s herd immunity defined r value alone actual number transmissions happing within population. 

These numbers way apply actual COVID situation anywhere real, concept works anything transmissible. still get LOT cases happening r value 1 depending many contagious people already have, especially lot movement population.

That's good hear! Everyone worried finding ways get hesitant people vaccinated, may even need it. So, country I'm currently Sinopharm Astrazenica vaccines available. 

But problem, wife 8 months pregnant, want daughter getting hurt getting vaccine. anyone know two vaccines effects pregnant mothers? avoid getting vaccinated baby born. hard find mouth breathing anti-science folks here. I'm sure thread back statement. I've block multiple people Reddit simply someone like comments. Got bombarded types nonsense US-aligned countries, media says hospitals always brink almost collapse never collapsed. reality probably somewhere close post-collapse (500 people die every day brazil waiting ICU bed).

Same thing happening India. friend's uncle ICU reason got spot due heavy string pulling well connected people. hear peep it.  still feel rather reactive forward thinking, watched new variants crush UK, EU Brazil others, watch starts Crush us (Canada) little done proactively ready .

I also feel leadership could much stronger wording enforcement regulations, think many listening giving much weight pleading nature requests PHO ""Do right thing"". Sugar go far need show stick! different Canada Australia.

The US different position, one much larger, it’s logical take chance migrants. 

Secondly, skill based immigration US difficult relative countries. 

The US immigration system present manages somehow suitable migrants people live country. Worst worlds. Netherlands slowing week again, hit 3mil! First 1.5 took almost three months, one.

1. universities try take classes online give leeway this
2. lot school sponsored stuff important, i.e clubs worse masks distancing, football basketball games full attendance
3. it'd still fucking annoying wear mask day lectures, labs, tests etc Definitivt nå sorts runkbulle Israeli government flipped position said Palestinians independent comes vaccines therefore problem. Palestinian Authority tried importing vaccines Israeli government blocked importation Gaza attempt pressure them, relented international pressure.  don’t take it. really don’t care lol think vaccinated foreign fans would first invited Olympics rather Japanese fans, monopoly Olympics tickets even though Japan started vaccinating anyone healthcare workers. seriously doubt optics gonna look good year regarding audience demographics.  southern Ontario US Europe certainly Germany.

Why condescending people posting legitimate opinions thread? even mean? estimates reckon done end July. weren’t allowed prior? Doctors doctors. gotta say, fetishize freedom hard US, sometimes get right  hospitals overloaded covid beds vacant, state lying too? got lot doctors family ground reality Gotcha, yeah, they're going get shot, wear seatbelts either. I'm asking back seemingly bullshit statement made above. person literally came express anxiety worded well asked corrected misinformed getting downvoted. lot people afraid injections and/or vaccines. doesn’t make anti mask anti vaccine shaming isn’t helping. Sometimes people fence asking help. Pushing side isn’t helping. End religious exemptions vaccines. decision religious impact health.  would allowed, others said, likely going waiting awhile kids. 

The kindest thing family (and others) get vaccinated eligible to. Given research coming telling us vaccinated spread COVID, getting vaccinated helps reduce overall risk family. mean, suggest insulting people solution, think waste time try convince people common sense they're actively choosing reject it. I'm going talk people, genuinely can't think kind words use, even could, I'm sure would. 

The, ""don't idiot, get vaccinated,"" comment obviously rhetorical. think need twist conspiracy theories favor.

Somehow make prevailing conspiracy theory virus created lab, way protect use *American* vaccine. Lots people literally considered virus personal threat nearly year now. Telling get vaccinated safety gonna work. Telling get vaccinated protect others work either everyone vulnerable already vaccinated, everyone wants vaccine get one. Telling get vaccinated cases could surge get needles arms either cases lowest they've year. Forcing get vaccinated implementing third-party domestic passports validates conspiracy theorists makes people skeptical vaccine.

IMO reopen soon everyone opportunity get vaccinated. Even kids, continued restrictions dangerous COVID. cases start going enough people vaccinated, motivate people get vaccinated. 

A lot last 20%-40% people hesitant get vaccinated get eventually. rush it. Maybe government offer gift cards people it. Maybe people get doctor offers routine visit. Maybe get 6 months see vaccinated friends died. Either way, there's zero reason hold society hostage hesitant people get shots. That’s literally what’s happening though. money federal government spent mass-vaccination pilot sites, administering fraction shots given across country day. Federal data show retail pharmacy program — signed 21 chains 17,000 stores — reach far Americans shorter time, according four senior officials direct knowledge matter. bottom line, sources said, Americans seem willing walk local pharmacist get vaccine travel federal vaccination site shot.

That represents shift strategy Biden administration, touted hubs powerful tool rapidly accelerate nation’s vaccine rollout symbol president’s push give federal government larger role pandemic response. FEMA data obtained POLITICO make clear pharmacy sites far outpacing stadiums, arenas convention centers enlisted mass vaccination sites.” No, life you, choices fucking stupid curtailed force. Everything affects others every vaccination collectively contributes return normalcy short term herd immunity long term, including people unable vaccinated, exist world. time tell here! ""university administrators know it'll take get back fall 2019"" fuck people on? feel like read clickbait ""new normal"" bullshit articles. I'm starting believe college head way far ass backtrack masks distancing fall. probably fine advise drinking significantly around second shot. day cases really started shooting downwards 56% population vaccinated one dose. Seems fairly random number think anyone could've predicted exactly day. Could've easily started dropping 51% case, still going point. could happen us, might start dropping earlier later terms percentage people one dose signs seem pointing cases shooting near future. Cases vs. hospitalizations/deaths started diverging priority vaccinations vulnerable populations rolled out. Misinformation existed long internet. Anti-vaxxers saying FDA approved, ""just"" EUA, they're going move goalposts approval comes they're serious people immuncomp family member; guidance get vaccine keep careful. getting vaccinated gives protection one less person likely give serious complications. Go able to. make sense wait. year-plus think people tired restrictions

Oh gee golly, didn’t know pandemics time limit. rate Michigan contracting it, expect getting closer. It’s race get shots arms! know test less miss cases death rate still way lower US. admitted hospital getting tested covid. anything hospitalization deaths best indicators wide spread virus is. old news? known since weeks J&amp;J deliver EU mid-April initially limited doses, pick speed May.

Well, known would limited doses, got cut half again.

We supposed get two shipments around 60.000 Belgium, got cut 50.000 whole month. (Which technically two weeks scheduled deliver 16th believe) sales.

Still, even back room guy - sociable person, good possibility provide new clients business people get know, current clients happy positive, friendly experience give them, etc. Management knows improve company's whole image, important social work. show management outside work (even ""show"" work, eventually picked on) Requirements like would considered racist U.S. Yeah definitely interesting place cool place visit live disagree, really, thought.

Could mandate people wear masks *when know sick*? Would work? enforced all, excuse get people wear masks possibly contaigious flu/etc.

Not think we'll flu developed world like ten years, still, meantime, may efficacious. Um no. currently infected point showing symptoms testing positive. going weeks it’s relatively recent 

Not OC, several weeks = relatively recent, imho.  Oh, feel guilt whatsoever. still would've upside person IMO. You’re asking bookmark people’s comments chance would arrive request provide proof you? disagree Russia's assessment year, doubt make significant difference CureVac. anything, Germany focus supporting CureVac wherever possible. It’s disproven. Many Americans vaccinated sites. may want utilize site like this, many people will. Heck one yesterday giving jab jab. Oh, I’m saying won’t anything! Israel isn’t quite yet either. year people itching restart lives things like see families. little virus Australia, deaths since last yr borders closed. Safer wait watch vaccines perform countries instead rushing. Feels good man. whole family vaccinated except small kids, college slowly getting back physical classes year, tomorrow going pub friends first time since started. 18 saw it’s worth, hate person interviews too. I’ve done multiple virtual interviews last year, found totally fine, probably better person. stakes feel lower you’re comfortable environment home puts ease. less person intimidation factor well. Looks like half that- 73K new cases today simply can't, also half rely UK US ingredients vaccines... explain China? Well great. Sounds like Germany everyone vaccinated time! still somewhat logistics issue limiting day day availability, terms capacity provider. freely available walk-in thing yet. OK thank you, maybe start stacking children eligible. give away excess parents (over 65) nervous get vaccine, im getting mine week I'm eligible. think see im fine they'll get think.

Hope that's case stragglers, maybe want know people vaccine okay afterwards. OK thank true difference massive may suggest (US maybe x1.2 tests per 1,000), really hope see Canada scale testing try keep hold things new variants, like UK early year scaling \~5 per 1000 10  That's worked well Slovakia.

Less testing would inflate positivity rate anything... work healthcare, direct patient contact. sent us home March 2020 within week (or less) decided fantastic. called us back July 4th weekend. walked office first time July, mumbled dumb was. Everything office home, often quieter focused environment. 

I changed roles within organization, started working home Sept 2020. me, going tough ever go back office whenever leave current job.

The plus column two kids 10 tremendous, since wife also works WFH. direct patient contact hospital.

There negative column, biggie: physical pain. take fewer breaks get less. setup shop home Sept 2020 literal bartop literal barstool. PS, 6 months WICKED pain. bought specific WFH desk chair fits needs, immediately. did, wait. Based numbers we've getting sheer volume infected children, probably do. Greenland possible people gotten vaccine wears off, may need one booster shot, halving need doses.


FTFY. always big scale. It’s low income issue sudden people care.

I'm sure low income people care children skipping class ghosting, economic social clout get anything done it. 

That mean concerns, higher income people, unwarranted. Yet sub call anti masker wearing mask outdoors agreeing you! make really good points.way better journalists, hire you. That's really like banks option automatically set billing within bank itself. way they'll transfer amount set based know agreed upon bill was.  happy finished high school Redditors began teaching. organizations dumb shit.

Big wig rolls town: need increase efficiency, we've brought another manager. I’m sure US would handle it, I’m pretty sure Netherlands would something like store owners choose either:
1. Allow 2 people per 25m2 shopping (or dining/drinking) area,
2. Allow unlimited amount people proof vaccination negative test.

Many (especially big) stores definitely opt second happy pay 50 bucks hour bouncer. Imagine Ikea 100 people 2000, makes huge difference.

As second point, don’t see distributing QR codes afterwards difficult. Good. work me. didn’t feel bad morning after. Within 36hrs completely back normal. I’ve friends around 48hrs. governments fighting lockdown hard. Imagine people would want return shut entire workforce.

One scariest things people realized many us go work vs many people actually need working things stay same.

Fact - elite *NOT* let us figure like 90% jobs completely unnessecary 10% ridiculously undervalued.

I figured called essential workers heroes- came time pay said okay wanted pay frontline workers- *critical* workers pool people want admit getting paid got smaller convoluted.

Now we're critical frontline essential staff ones getting danger / pandemic pay. begging pandemic difficult adapted. unfortunately let someone go weren’t working all, office thing kept working. said, want person team anyway? No.

You know can't force it? fully tested FDA. Misinformation Thank you! 35 y/o woman. sore arm slightly nauseous next day. slightly. Nothing crazy. Worried second shot coming soon, though.  sorta hope next big spending bill pays people get vaccine. dont track total numbers focus first doses, mostly wanted know long till got vaccine. Even one seems like mostly virtue signalling. executive order rather actual law going make legally flimsy. Well, yes, contradict point making.  go reddit complain broke. figured thought would work face value. Sorry hear wfh going poorly many. godsend me, programmer, unsuccessfully tried find remote work times pandemic hit. 

It like catch 22. Needed show remote experience. Interviews 3-4 stages normally. nightmare... bit longer, norm! that's twist see coming. took second dose yesterday morning. spent rest day drinking lot water. night mild fever one tylenol resolved. Kept drinking water like tomorrow. Today mostly fine, bit slow. told wear masks.

The tiniest clip context clearly base opinion Fauci on.  Productivity levels years now. becoming efficient work force (due technology, education, longevity, etc) changing work scene would following suit. hybrid idea gives people feeling extra personal time productive. harm trying point. ""other side"" irrelevant discussion. create public policy messaging contributed deaths hundreds thousands people. ""Take bath"" financial terms means heavy losses. Similar phrases like ""got cleaned out"" ""taken cleaners"". Getting ""soaked"" means overpaid something. ""Soak rich"" means charge rich extra taxes pay stuff. ""Absorbing"" losses. Lots water-themed phrases reason.

It's thought origins gambler terms. quit job wanted back office. That’ll dog 

Went new company remote role pay. Cup left hand. Leaning water cooler right arm. 

“That crazy year change, eh??” 1000 seems like REALLY small sample size.  Yes me. couple virtual ones past year getting current job. included least anxiety ridden interviews I’ve ever had. Add name list, feeling little sore otherwise great. two weeks hit 50% first shot. Believe me, driving two hours vaccine &amp; waiting hour actual shot, stopping Krispy Kreme dropped right schedule.

It sounds lot better theory, swear. California saying wear next year kids vaccines approved. Absolutely way people area going keep it. It’s beyond insanity. “Well, would say...you here?” Plenty soon college grads willing take places. Yes there's definitely overlap, there's definitely significant non-overlapping portion well. also imagine people refuse vaccine tend take Covid less seriously. Deaths plumetting. Administration pretty consistently lagged supply two weeks. 

And US currently taking delivery around 27M doses per week.  openness Europeans possible side-effects would make sane person trust say, benefits outweigh risks.

Compare likes China hiding bad stats Russia's sputnik vaccine, even vaccinating population huge numbers, used soft diplomacy wars Europe others.

( Russia ~70,000 claimed covid deaths 2020, excess death total +400,000 [source]( )

And compare UK stats, seems vaccination effort defeated virus many terrible months UK depicted almost worst victim entire world I’de rather kids continue virtual school well💁🏽 Id rather fire go back onsite you, people could potentially infect.  Geographic/climatological factors probably played role - cases around Northeast flat growing rest country falling, also prior immunity lower Michigan due handling previous waves relatively well.  know someone worked photo cheque thing, works *years* covid rollout nothing pandemic.

I worked guy lived 2 states away (lived CT worked NJ). commute 2 hours trains, buses, subways, hell.

What precedent? 67 countries plus entire EU already approved it, already using today would could get hands some. everyone still access free drive testing area? wondering easy parts country access testing point? looks like Florida stick around April 30th plan getting rid that. represents 63% nation's 1-week increase 73% nation's 2-week increase average hospitalizations. 

It's basically Michigan rest country. wonder wrong.  Reminds driving various office locations. would see people walking around perimeter smoking joking. think days office work numbered. people want return office supervisor. Think financial savings (not employee,) company. that, save land build parks instead. Concrete jungle sux think overcomplicating issue. Learning hard. That's students become disengaged. Motivation easy build, need build slowly close interaction clear relevance. That's much much difficult online space.  side note would love interviews remote on. 1000% relaxed virtual interview going office. found much better personally. hope that’s new trend. anyone know cases reported? Like breakdown? microchip goes online, 5G connection really invigorating ;) went back 5 days week last summer. hate working home. fiance furloughed, worked kitchen table destroyed back felt bad quiet day shitty wifi kept kicking off. place small.

I sadly, type a, lack separation terrible. commute half hour driving. commuted 2 years 4 hour day thing... even would rather back hurt forever go back shit. horrible soul crushing. dont know would miss that. literally job home. point return back office.

Companies either go full remote lose half developers guys across street offering bump **and** full remote. hit revenue loss productivity large, lot straight drown.

Can't believe upvoted. employers fault wanna charge less/barely match unemployment(which case time). works. One now. Another plans [clinical soon. [More Well tough shit going back soon. believe enough people vaccinated summer ""get back normal"" includes working full time. Seriously. States 65% administered/distributed giving half allocated doses high risk states reach 70%. instead putting delivery virus liquid, Vaxart freeze-dries it, turning powder formulated pill stored room temperature. private university. Would suck, absolutely. they're still well within rights this. I'm personally worried health anymore kids young get vaccinated want see hospital system community relies get overrun COVID-19 patients. someone worked prop management, checks fees. fees add quickly   People want see face meeting fuck hell. This. Exactly this. 22 years me. You’re right, IMO corporate response downsize office space save money rent. They’ll coordinate half staff M-W half Th-F, desk sharing lockers. drive commercial real estate demand down, shift real estate towards housing, retail, industrial, etc. Demand larger homes go due people needing extra bedroom office. Etc. here, 10 hours $60 week gas! wish. they’re allowing pandemic continue harm innocents including people can’t get vaccinated health reasons kids. also raises risk mutating form evades vaccines. 

They don’t live bubble. live society hear they’re selfish irresponsible. fiancée same, bought house, combined commute 2 hours way. We’d leave 7AM get home 7:15. Never again. exactly happened company. global headquarters located 25 miles outside major city, went wfh saw changes productivity. employee surveys later decided sell campus, move major city *build* new smaller global headquarters, savings long run. (I’m sure move already works quarantine probably solidified idea) new headquarters basically need based center place prefer work office. thinking people choose work home given chance. Pretty cool come understanding quickly. said laid won’t get enjoy spoils lol oh well Maybe actually right last year masks lockdowns, hence low level natural immunity. Hospitalizations going :/  Fuck yes. Keep home please.  would quit spot asked give full time remote status. On. The. Spot.

And I'd apply disability. physically can't make office. office.

Remote *evolution* work; temporary aberration. many jobs feasibly remote, be. Must be.

There countless people disabilities finally get part society. Earn paycheck. Feel worth value participation.

Don't forget us. gained us. lose us one fell swoop. first symbolic, dollars tax bill.

Then targeted demographics hesitant/resistant.

Then leftovers. depends. There’s CDC guidance it’s doctor advise mast cell patients individually. I’m glad coworker fine. simple. go school years get degree Covid need semester two graduate can't vaccine fully FDA approved.


So yeah ""they choice"" throw away years time money spent, hope credits transfer get vaccine fully tested/ approved FDA. agree! water cooler conversation drop-by conversations eat lot time. easier focus home, plus comforts hand. time saved commute probably best gift. Almost 2 hours RT nothing sneeze at. take walk get exercise fresh air instead. also use time prepare healthy meals rather eating out. mind going maybe twice per week, certainly every day. company still paying office space. they’ll definitely save cooling costs summer, coffee time being, less toilet paper, soap, paper towels, less wear tear chairs, conference room equipment, everything. American exceptionalism finest. Good luck think depends. Short conversations making coffee help get know departments might never see. slightly longer conversation, that’s okay too. Stop talk everyone 10 minutes every day? Yeah, that’s hard no. You’re work doubt job talking coworkers. one preemptively quit go contract never go back? Omg exactly.. need moment feel important.. either gossiping someone, working, feeling important job actually dictates. combine waterfall agile get whirlpool, spins round round nothing gets done. 17 fu***ng years?!?!? WTF?!? people pay daycare, would office.  stupid.  work home send kids daycare! also necessarily see anything particularly wrong services. Especially given devices, banks tend put speed back burner. perfect world would eradicate virus.

That never goal Playing yo-yo game economy peoples businesses Isn’t handle things.

These restrictions implemented scientific expert guidance result Ontario massive outbreak. ICU admission highest point entire pandemic. Yes handle things. extremely serious situation. problem people unvaccinated get mutate eventually evade current vaccines right back mess former coworker second Pfizer dose yesterday. doctor’s office case nothing hives Benadryl took care of.

No idea case severe typical. Yes! That’s I’m right looking someone else tell go Make 35%! (I never asked) Thank you! Yeah worked jobs like breaks observe people jack shit. Like entire day social event them.. Like fuck, aren’t busy maybe could least look it? That's they're here. like twilight zone. way? specific difference Biden make?

I'd rater job 30 hours time talk particular fellow humans really care about. colleagues them. Joe? you? Universities forcing anyone get vaccine, simply allowing students vaccinated. still get make choice. think that's mostly us occasionally mild vasovagal syncope shots... Low blood sugar trigger me, apparently that's uncommon. (very rural), week 200 tests available, they've got tests. Oklahoma really dropped ball much care. 2hr drive tulsa even OKC. government can't pay people minimum wage, hold work places standards?

The government can't fire black, workplace held standards?


They standards.


You're going keep saying kept standards simple government dosnt deem vaccine fully authorized. held safety standards. I'm jealous people slept generally time last year.

I two kids, except summer, one home last year. Daycare never closed little one (employee daycare hospital), took older daughter summer.

I basically live life before: still get take kid daycare, pick work. actually commute farther now, since office right daycare. thing that's different go eat, see anyone. miss occasional happy hour. basically break.

My employer deciding remote work. think they're working logistics offering mix options: full time office, hybrid, full time remote. guess we'll find out. Add list. split days home office, day employer pushes back day hand resignation. Welp get see real life stats Brazil right now, president stated plans enact national lock down. mean, you, theres big difference wearing mask protect others potential death/long term ailments protecting others sniffles. I'm sure I'm asshole pointing out, is. :-/ internationally leadership handling things well trump here... wishing best though.....    perhaps next major outbreak something new (like HIV COVID). governments act responsibly quickly, instead slowly all.  current efforts every nation world would give total grade D+ us all. passing grade.... barely.... everyone died.  many places offering full time remote - can't imagine company making hard rule. They'll lose 33% employees overnight lot others ever apply future. Why? vaccinated, accounts there's much worried about. Variants gonna variant, people incubating (largely elderly immunocompromised) part waiting around get vaccines. Best luck job search. Don’t give WFH dreams! thinking number people category would higher. third pretty good though! people running one false statement another zero accountability wrong again.  time, New York state kind thing? yes- know technically New York mandating it, technically vaccine passport ""vaccine passport"" whatever wanna call it- time one working businesses allow verify medical records customers?

I know state currently *forcing* kind vaccine passport system, seems like essentially every Governor that's spoken firmly against, based yesterday's White House statements seems like Biden well.

Edit: chain OP says he/she actually call police 🤦  bother. Probably useless middle manager type troll trying justify worthlessness. Natural immunity sadly necessary part herd immunity. There's scenario get everyone vaccinated. 80% adults would miracle. end restrictions, states harshest restrictions lowest infection numbers definitely going higher case numbers since everyone wants vaccine less people infected. makes sense see states like New York Michigan suffering reason.

One things hear lot flu severe deadly kids covid. say wife get fully vaccinated, don’t need worry 6 year old daughter. job planning interact hundreds young adults without vaccine, mask, social distancing requirements. worried? go, disinvalidating struggles others died/struggled more. someone says became homeless lockdown, gonna tell thing? “Well you’re still alive deal it”

And kids expected isolate covid risk, ARENT going playground. wouldn’t expect 4 year old keep mask entire time unless I’m watching trained entirely well That’s amazing that’s Germany’s able reach 300k per day. Canada crossed 100k like yesterday.  dont know live, reopened person schools Tuesday second March. Almost exactly two weeks later, 14th cases began rise single digits day 40-60 day, 150 day winter peak. Local news pointing towards youth sports vector, cant say really sports in-classroom learning. See, CDC zero credibility. Nothing government, everything US hoarding supplies itself. necessary three shots, two do, hurt either. i'm wrong, countries strong social security nets exist?

I come social capitalist society live world according true. Nice opening argument there! That’s lot British exceptionalism unpack I’ll give go:

Ok still doesn’t mean isn’t significant reduction overall numbers people vaccinated. merit mostly giving second doses almost net 0 growth rate. Europe means increase rates significantly

We won’t get them, India suffering huge wave government physically let export. good gone counting predictions pointless

I don’t care theoretically worse, look past record vaccines - Moderna particularly Pfizer met exceeded lot targets deliveries. manufacturers struggled even meet basic contracts. betting man know would bet deliver jabs

I see believe it, already struggling meet European demand. can’t see really delivering much new months

Maybe low AZ still noticeable effect it

It pretty poor though it’s hardly grown time since started it. Ok another unknown new plant new vaccine, take bloody months produce anything value. German manufacturing always outstrip us, better skilled way better resources

I would ask doctor vaccine provider suggest. Chicken pox also survivable. Still required. association shown longer true. Published months ago Nature. almost assuredly 2022 distancing done with. could see masks still around fall, capacity now. think governmental mandates gone mostly private businesses requiring them. distancing almost done anyway. do, we'll talk. Yes, totally completely wrong. pretty much fine except couple hours chills second Moderna dose, it’s worth. deaths likely plummet vaccination effort betters. understand it’s awful people dying taking year children’s lives away telling “deal it” dishonest IMO Absolutely this. 

Did 3 sessions earlier year anxiety issues enough time doc give tools needed get functional. ideas vaccination would reduce symptoms long COVID. One virus patients detected. Another immune unbalance long COVID patients somehow corrected vaccination. Frankly surprised outcome await work understand it. realize nobody going believe me, wanted provide perspective. live ""red"" part country. Almost everyone around ""red"" lot family. Virtually everyone know getting vaccine, working get line, still booked ""red"" area. people, any, including crazy-ass parents, think people take precautions ""Frail"", ""Timid"" ""Beta"". know people exist, course, get frustrated people assume ""red persuasion"" board, true.

I'm telling people exist, do, fact person know who's refusing get vaccine craziest reasons ""blue persuasion"", know enough representation population whole.

The vaccine hesitancy people know general generally reasonable, wide variety people.

Thanks reading. Every one stories also always end events justify behavior, end ""villains"" losing absolute near comic book fashion.

They use apparently extreme unusual example evidence norm offer bad advice way. issue recently, emergence B.1.1.7. Known transmissible, prevalent youth. Take Minnesota schools Michigan schools example. Advising schools open okay then, variant, longer advisable. done US IMO. held 2 days inspect shipment make sure vaccines delivered. Considering vaccination sites weren’t even scheduled open another 3 days got doesn’t make differnece See, that's deciding something said means something different actually said. Ascribing hidden meaning may any.

That's I'm wondering room restaurant like 15 feet away infected person many cases would actually cause spread acting like bad things happening people entirely dis-invalidates struggles people online school pandemic general? period time children teenagers/young adults supposed grow people socially developmentally isolation others certainly negative effects. Whether that’s necessary entirely different conversation, please don’t act negative effects CDC still saying avoid medium large gatherings, probably find guidance scenario exactly, see link CDC even recommend testing fully vaccinated people *after known exposure* unless display symptoms. vaccine good vaccine right imo. goal get people vaccinated side effects possible every vaccine. read New York Times article said opposite.  Covid gives people worse response vaccines. Anecdotally I’ve heard things friends got vaccine. None J &amp; J though.  Thank you!! It’s frustrating. get Covid take care COVID positive family includes 4, 2, 10 month old? one. That’s who. doctor encouraged us get vaccine childcare thank goodness. tons appointments available got immediately. Shit, beer free drugs? Sign up. Lmao, that’s true lolllllllllll meanwhile america *selfishness intensifies* clearly fear-mongering propaganda elderly 'at risk' population vaccination process effectively complete. 

If assume majority high-risk people vaccinated, default low-risk people left 'exposed'. 

If everyone left low-risk high-risk people feel safe, general population starts forget fear instilled virus 'may go enjoy freedoms' trustworthy government gives okay. 

These types articles headlines released like clockwork lockstep narratives counter official narrative. pure propaganda. 

It helps people point studies purely partly assumptive theoretical without able point clear numbers showing headline claims without fill holes data assumptions. gonna debate definition communism - either theory practice. isn’t forum repeated condescension makes think wouldn’t actually “love hear take” all, you’re prick. 

Re: capacity. Charge higher prices? Ok, you’re essentially saying “change business model unrealistic ways accommodate new legislation.” want explain it’s unrealistic venue charge compensate reduced capacity I’m happy to. “Use space purposes”? Again, you’re saying “if don’t like rules, change.” doesn’t sound like choice me. sign lease 400 person capacity venue suddenly capacity gets cut half unless comply new rules, complying rules barely considered choice all. Also, side note, it’s determine what’s good bad business decision. lots venues depend large, infrequent events generate revenue. 

To second point, no, wouldn’t necessarily closed already. Though it’s true lost lots venues forever due lockdowns, SBA loans PPP loans made available. you’re making another unfounded assumption there.

Fun accuse arguing bad faith. may know law, understanding events spaces venues work isn’t hot. Okay sure think August 2020 cases rise? guess think case lot places opened schooling see spike, expecting attributed schools actually bad. vast majority people get fine. know sucks now, side pretty soon - gotta get there. best approach simple balances restrictions reopening rather strongly favoring one other.

If vaccine easily available adults adult activities like restaurants, gyms, bars, etc opened. vaccinated go, aren't, either take risk get vaccinated. puts responsibility back individual. kids vaccinated, choose keep home bring them, want vaccinated not, etc.

The problem setting arbitrary high level vaccinations like 70-80% like Fauci says that, might never get there, might take long time, majority society held hostage small minority people reluctant get vaccine.

As practical matter, everyone know vaccinated jumped right back lives. 80-something mother law arriving 2nd visit 2 weeks minutes fact. Maybe? Maybe not? don’t know. Banning exports douchiest thing I've seen while. People got first dose can't get second dose. Same. closest trial site 9 1/2 hours away. husband still seriously considered trying traveling back forth ended placebo? We’ll continue masking/distancing. manufacturing powerhouse meaningless export it. I'll give updoot messenger

That said, hope everyone planning attend tells em fuck goes elsewhere. Google translate:

Yeah, action spike peg. Good news. unless I'm mistaken, far variants vaccines work well South African variant. correct? remember time older generation willing allow disease that, even given restrictions exist, killed 3 million people, kill even kids use computer screen months. that? easy shot. prepared, reconstituted takes time normal vaccine.

Where work (doctor's office Germany), started vaccinating Biontech vaccine today. colleague needed 30 minutes prepare reconstitute 18 doses gave today. expect it'll go bit quicker tomorrow, today first time, definitely need time space everything. Roughly 50% Pfizer vaccine recipients ‘adverse reactions’. news. got Moderna sore arm shots. fact, 4 family members got Moderna also sore arms. ok go grocery store 50-70% effectiveness mask wanting go mask 90%+ effectiveness vaccine? dare think horrible thing worthless piece trash. Thank answer 50% considered baseline approval. 64% still good  Lol. truly amusing statement state, ~no rural county rising cases ~every urban county does. We're point ""evenly distributed geographically"" vaccinations pandemic might places others. support questions asked [open investigation team? Stopped by, like went house?? Yeah could case. It’s also possible rural schools decades old built population area 1/5 now. educational infrastructure bad every setting. Thanks doc! fuck getting J&amp;J vaccine? offered restaurant employees city, late 40s continued ""better better"" praise Pfizer Moderna (and relative lack better better news concerning J&amp;J) feel like maybe waited days 2-shot version. two questions:

Should waited I'm slightly riskier age work risky environment?

Is upcoming ""better better"" reports J&amp;J? got 1st Pfizer vaccine Wednesday March 31st. contact someone Sunday tested positive Tuesday well started getting symptoms Tuesday. point week since first shot. 

I googled can’t find anything gives info much protection 2 weeks. 

Any info there?  Haha, interesting watch US, I'll say that! thinks need keep restrictions place everyone including kids vaccinated?

People may say every single person known get fully vaccinated personally relaxed. 

Even ardent supporters restrictions going seeing people. 

The taste normalcy great think many people able stop get vaccinated. 

Right people still gotten one doses, change within another 6-10 weeks. can't see many people fully vaccinated willing keep significant restrictions place. Oh yes. wife teacher I’m considering return teaching- mismanagement minds time along reports like one. 
The school I’m applying today 3500 students... Yeah went eat stayed night casino last week, 3 weeks post first jab. Got tested yesterday case, negative, systems go second jab weekend people aren’t now. So, bit like Texas repealing mask mandate...it’s net zero effect. masking still are, never were...still aren’t.  It’s almost like, hear out...despotic dickheads let countrymen die blame anybody go Germany German GP here.
There little supply strict priorisation would needed security service.
Besides that, government decided vaccinate GPs second priority group (behind aged 80+) although diagnose treat COVID patients daily base sure afraid could use vaccine ourselves. believe reccomend 14 days taking vaccine covid vaccine Outstanding! point every nation must come realization race virus 🦠 literally vaccine versus virus, depending well get ahead determine whether go lull wait variations pop horizon. 

This way easy category ; go get vaccinated soon it’s made available you.

Best wishes all. ""likely far better"" requires *several* logical leaps provable right now. much reasonable wait deaths actually low. course things do. Could mRNA ever change affect DNA cell nuclei human body (could RNA could ever ""write back"" onto DNA, change way DNA writes RNA) ? Asked especially regard covid vaccines use mRNA. Covid like flu like viruses

Covid killed 500,000 people year, resulted several lockdowns throughout country, massive detrimental effect economy, resulted many universities closing campus' going online learning. compare flu virus currently vaccinate for. Given massive financial burden covid caused universities, would foolish require complicate matter, young people already Covid, already protection. need vaccinated?

I think really complicates anything. Yes, even people covid required get vaccine. know long antibodies infection last, detrimental getting vaccine covid. Good luck hope goes well Absolutely awful messaging. Hope learn big time. worries.

Well that's kinda thing different topic, ruling class/bosses, aka employers assumed shitty. That's always case. like unions, good bad, employers good bad. people love employers union would ruin relationship.

On hand people hate employers union would least protect them. know I'm say whole lot complicated hypothetically nobody gave shitty employers time day would good employers therefore zero need unions. enough providers actually pull off? don’t never went school there, long since graduated, still feel crushed. CA universities likely follow suit. vaccinations open many counties week, next week. Almost 5 months fall session. 


This we’re dealing parts CA. crushed me. I’m sure return 2019 normal many years, ever. Obsessed masks, distancing, closing things prove much care, even though hurts lower class students wanting climb social wealth class. vaccinated. Even Gavin’s June 15th “opening.” states quite nearly open, many quite sometime, without incident closed ones. forget betriebsärzte. checked DC fully booked. maybe short term thing. think extremely pessimistic even right, vast, vast majority vulnerable people vaccinated, matter much? Even delivered second doses right July, we'd still set restriction free summer much lower death/hospitalisation rate we've previously. EU catches power - we're still good shape! Actually, keep washing produce, people. microbes besides Sars-Cov-2 make sick.

As cereal boxes milk cartons? Yeah, need wipe Clorox wipes.  think phase restrictions next 2-3 months depending vaccine rollout stats look. last restrictions large venue capacity limits mask mandates lifted ideally 50-70 percent overall population vaccinated. said depends vaccine uptake goes plateau percent lower rate transmission still isn’t creeping might worth getting rid last levels restrictions soonest. still think schools masked given vaccines students least like 10-16 urban schools notorious cramped, case rural schools. could get data energy go digging. :P Developed countries able keep feeble elderly often multiple serious comorbidities living old age

This something I've thinking long time. interesting pandemic hit developed nations severely. would think would opposite past typically was. instance, Spanish Flu particularly deadly India.

I personal experience excruciatingly long U.S. healthcare system keep person alive. suspect lot high death rates western nations. Thanks papers, take look get chance. 650k yesterday actually one things common sense would tell long scientific study could. one area exceptionally good started bit worse, that's spike, small spike.

If another area bad got bit worse, that's also small spike.

If another area great suddenly done pretty bad, that's large spike.

It's relative, aggregate show this, let good doctor educate you. compared people placebo got virus, cases general. course variants could make difference, far exactly testing took place, big difference trials done time heightened cases, trial would've done faster.

I think said stupidly, hope makes sense. not, try say clearly. I've heard, think ""perfect world"" data would likely show J&amp;J's efficacy rising meet Pfizer/Moderna's rather way around. also me, 4. Hate feeling sick dreading affects shot. remember really really weird reaction tetanus shot teen. minute injection began feeling really hot, chills, started dry heaving. fun all. 

With said, I'm getting J&amp;J Saturday. j&amp;j though still interesting know sure studies, see specific reason think it'd cause bad reaction. Goddammit come /r/coronavirus evade constant flow local Canadian bad news read countries great, see bad news Canada too! society ever enforced rule half people allowing half act freely, half person belongs impossible tell visual inspection? 

I can't think example. Anything even close seems doomed failure never tried. finally stop washing hands?  Ah right, old 5 yr olds driving pandemic lie again. Yes remember early tests anywhere way really know someone severe symptoms. ""case"" usually already serious illness.

Now opposite true... testing widespread, vulnerable people vaccinated. case far less serious likely positive test healthy person.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* per section 2.1 study:( Study design study population)

The current study randomized, double-blind-placebo controlled trial study. enrolled 40 severe COVID-19 patients admitted intensive care unit (ICU) 40 mild cases COVID-19 hospitalized Imam Reza Hospital Tabriz University Medical Sciences. seen stories festivals happening like 1-2 weeks ago  whitty say it, source please? Michigan reopening state? Britain set reach herd immunity Monday Thanks correction. data week ago, based 17M total vaccinations. Ratio clot cases 25M article nearly same: 0.0003%.

Deaths higher point out: still 0.00007% vaccinated. 

 Contracting COVID overall death rate 2% &amp; UK variant attacks younger people original.

So point remains: risk disease orders msgnitude greater infinitesimal risk vaccine. Tbh, looked testing numbers? pfizer cut failure pay bill need convince people vaccines longer necessary. Like said, support vaccine fully vaccinated would recommend staff students, especially high risk get vaccines. work covid patients got vaccine awhile ago. important realize reason many places aren’t requiring covid vaccine time really due pending FDA approval status. transgender doesn’t expose deadly viruses. unvaccinated reason potentially expose deadly virus. Hardly tough sell haha varients named location media can't original strain called wuhan original I'm going go limb say include Palestinians. like celebrating white communities South Africa apartheid hitting heard wondering since momomonoki said. definitely believe saying Japan messing up. I've even see data way worse countries region. there's many countries even worse terms death seems like mismanagement Japan did, there's countries much worse, like (the USA). Maybe people different standards ""bad"". probably safer wait get vax next month month after. Death rates US currently 2 times high compared NL currently, NL still dropping (19 here, 986 us, adjusting pop. size, that's around 2.5 times many daily deaths). (for reason OWID reported 2,500 deaths US 7th April, know about).

Also, flying travelling pretty big risk. questionable actually safer go get vax wait vaccine coming 1 1,5 months time. edited suggest they've vaccinating confirmed recovered cases 5-6 weeks. ask, Palestinians? fewer deaths 2020 2019.)

I'm saying Japan's testing flawless, compelling evidence they've massively undertested. Statue Liberty said bring tired, etc. So, Covid did. I’m doctor. She’s vaccinated things, gets yearly flu shot, wants get Covid vaccine, advised to. don’t know details don’t know treatment regimen, it’s really business, know she’s undergoing intense treatment. know told me, since discussing vaccine (I get 2nd shot Sunday) sad advised to. boss surprised left? wonder trouble finding anyone fill position. True. Go ahead read paragraphs tidbit posted. clearly says it’s fully approved tested pregnant women decision made woman OB. 

I’m pregnant discussing OB opting wait. would probably feel differently risk factors comorbidities. it’s certainty approved use pregnant women point. pay low. People figuring truth. Yeah checked recovered CONFIRMED cases get vaccines there's probably overlap ppl know recovered 
Vaccinated people believe anyone severe history allergic reactions told get vaccine. small subset people history sever allergies, anyone happens allergic nuts whatever. long first dose dose know there's issue chance one coming up? would also pretty weird precedent force elderly staff exposed COVID positive students safe effective vaccine available free.  Ppl  Germans still try buy sputnik? Ah great - that's wondering.  claim 70% using face masks public transportation lie words? I'm indian find racist all. 

India long way go vaccinate everyone. Last thing want make countries eradicated covid get rekt like us Ditto. really enjoy 25 min walk downtown adjacent neighborhood office. It’s nice little way set / reset day plus really miss exercise. Wow Georgia disgusting low, makes sense opened vaccinations everyone quickly. case, shy kid school, team sports. something loud, mean, gregarious kids made freeze. envied fitness levels. wanted like them, different interests. realise sensitive people, individual sports easier. So, running, swimming working help. hand, like going pubs, provided meet interesting people, boring sports people. country live, pubs open gyms, museums cafes not. HATE, nightclubs. (I feel way parties).The nightclubs still closed here, gyms cafes open. IIRC people get rona eligible vaccines “Any currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines administered pregnant lactating people; ACIP state product approved much everyone else although trial data limited. AstraZenica fucking hard shady shit every step way seems. Like Fauci told them, type shit makes people trust scientists Yes no. think ""would look new job"" ""quit"" title important to. obvious thinking it, one quit without backup plan. Fauci talking US. article Israel. effects pandemic show statistics decades. ""Covid Generation"" disadvantaged rest lives. point people recovered *have also vaccines* can't 56+15 find number immune people. That's pretty cool Politics. same, live here....  knows, eh? Oh well, good thing downvotes arbiter truth. Britain Europe. I'm you. There's narrative children suffered pandemic. EVERYONE suffered. like 5 people made like bandits this. Children get priority. Everyone's development stagnated year, children. internet, thats easy find answer. what’s plan? Lock kids even more? Seems like nobody cares got Moderna yesterday sore muscle injection site mild fever far. far comparable reaction flu vaccines day 1 injection 1 I'll keep eye out. Although data reaches December may changes surges California New York happening around then. nice total studies pandemic over.  “South African variant” part fizzled out... even South Africa. Buying vaccines investing development vaccines. UK, much smaller nation terms population, spent £2.9 billion deals 5 vaccines. EU aggressive enough come back bite again. I'm sociologist guess way individualistic like admit.
Still I'm sure there’s combination factors work here, COVID fatigue certainly plays part this.
I remember first lockdown saw people getting mad folks going job weren’t respectful restrictions enough.
Now seems situation completely reversed.
We're hearing ICU beds taken COVID patients yet reach hospitalisation peak, still one could feel there’s dominant sense denial.
As vaccines already world champion anti vaxx sentiment even pandemic began, guess really awful folks hopefully rollout prove wrong. Hungarian here. I'll get Sputnik next week. see stop posting afterwards, well... draw conclusions ;)

Just kidding, dad already got Sputnik 2 months ago he's fine. wonder bad reaction j&amp;j, would moderna person equally bad reaction? would died got moderna 🤣 also higher effacy far real world support ability prevent severe disease, death, even symptomatic infections j&amp;j ones. Unfortunately people strange obsession criticising AZ vaccine. ignorant need learn facts. “noted risk contracting virus touching contaminated surface less 1 10,000.”

People: there’s still chance! can’t sure! Better safe sorry! 🙄 show everyone seriously taking pandemic!

That’s going happen still happening. lot covid theater.

Like plastic shields place everyone wearing masks. ones people lean around anyway can’t hear. “Nadeau dizziness” literally tell expect get it!

I got J&amp;J last week hours shot little light headed. next day pretty tired sore appetite. day normal. indoor arena tour (think Madison Square Garden). People slacked office too, home something useful slacking instead pretending look busy. wanted Pfizer glad that's got! first one far- 85% protection baby! got second Pfizer Monday zero side effects except standard sore arm. It’s interesting effects people differently. would define young adults 18-29. calls someone 40s young? important point know long immunity first dose lasts. Assure vast majority people side effects schedule Friday safe.  team hospital (over 40 people) got 2nd dose day none required time off. I'm getting vacc betriebsarzt. lol probably 20 years since used needle last time. Maybe influx new returning people since sub longer depressing. got Moderna shot back January, coincidentally lot bunch people adverse reactions California. 1st dose nothing, arm sore, 2nd dose added feeling hungover, popped advil good new. However, coworkers taken days. running theory significant reactions 2nd dose might point exposed covid body going overdrive antibodies. DTaP, flu, MMR (other measles), polio, etc. produce sterilizing immunity? Wow!  Boris accepted current timeline, really bring indoor opening restaurants forward middle April. getting downvoted? right April though look averages, think did. Hand washing one things think stick around.

But it’s hard fast food places still bathrooms closed “due covid-19.” 🙄🙄

I think places hand washing sinks available. Sorry hear reaction. husband felt side effects fr J&amp;J all. Yes got it. didn’t buy any. Government relying AZ could manufacture here. want vaccine fine, accept risk

once one vaccines full FDA approval, imagine colleges ""we're back classrooms &amp; masks required. require everyone vaxxed"". vaccines work well 100% protection; preventing non-vaxxed people (unless CAN'T vaxxed b/c immunocompromised etc) campus protect everyone else stupid take keep running headlines little effort verify what's going indeed case. yet that's exactly lazy media done year. Someone's second cousin's former roommate nurse said saw people lined along ER ward. hospitals must ""at breaking point"" guess. 11.  another report recently CDC tracking early essential workers vaccinated first month immunity. winter, peak pandemic. real-world stats accumulated able match 90+ percent rates seen early trials.

Edit: go, real-world trials able achieve 90 percent Doses actual mRNA size Pfizer mRNA sequence: Moderna sequence: used software count letters Moderna sequence described here: compared 5M got India second 5M batch that's held Indians want vaccinate themselves. definitely compared 440M pop Europe. state opened colleges last fall, massive amounts COVID cases, shutting smaller college towns got absolutely crushed. cant elaborate much states opened person schooling August 2020, area go on. honestly dont follow national trends nearly much state local community, surrounding states similar far schools reopening similar times got similar rise cases did. 3.6
Not great, terrible. best way seems newly vaccinated monitored nurses groups raise hand discomfort occurs. Aside typical waiting line reaction wait time, think whole process took 30 seconds. sure required read Germany make take longer. LOT places do. Amusement parks still are.

I temperature checks part time job.... construction site.

For like 8 people.. tractors. wear masks too. Outside. themselves. “corporate says.” 

The excessive covid theatre really turning people risks. It’s anyway opaque me. conservatism largely product right wing control government social institutions postwar period, thanks large part US subversion democracy. LDP received massive funding opposition research political opponents US intelligence services outset guarantee country’s position outpost US interests East Asia.

By contrast, South Koreans overthrew one, two different US-backed right wing regimes popular protest movements trade union uprisings 70s 80s driven women.

If want push things much back, Japan far less socially conservative Edo period, time concepts gender sexuality much fluid unbound western norms. idea conservatism innate political construction ruling elites little relation history.  NZ suspending entry citizens traveled India. anywhere comparable shit China bad measures Trump took. reffering Eastern European wages (and living expenses) *much* lower US.

Most US Companies bother outsourcing China, would much harder get CPP, real Chinese workers, board working US company. India, outsourcing possible, quality workers *much* lower average US. Also timezones, different cultures oh downplaying it. parents chose kids, figure out. issue build hospitals meet demand smallest shifts consumer behavior stresses capacity. surprised?

We build roads barely handle capacity, antagonizing people traffic. hire police enough coverage keep citizens mostly unbothered crime. would hospitals different?

Lockdowns like trying solve traffic problems telling everyone stay home. Rather provide sufficient, alternate methods transportation, rather building roads, take boneheaded approach. Specifically blood clots younger people good odds getting mild cases low death numbers COVID.

I see stats thrown around X # AZ vaccine administered vs # blood clots blood clots leading death. aren’t isolating age range. That’s 55 makes sense reward outweighs risk.

It’s also possible younger people stronger immune system what’s causing clotting begin with. ['the country 5,570  isn’t true tho. JnJ effectiveness much lower Pfizer Modena.  think they're dramatic point. real possibility, shaping become reality time goes on. thinking along lines minimal national messaging entirely state/local officials could follow reasonably established consensus quickly possible. However, point, Trump clearly demonstrated (maybe most) politicians ability judge point findings credible. think status quo widely-followed, arguably overly-cautious CDC actually ideal infrastructure messaging pandemic? Thank u/AbsentMindedEdie ! vocabulary lesson, instructional videos introduction professional rugby!

My first reaction - women whose two ACL reconstructions - fear players' knees cut juked, side-stepped threw dummies. second ""No wonder people think American football prissy."" Holy cow! running tackling without stitch protective gear? suppose makes one feel less invincible son first day hockey gear (slamming trees), eliminates dirty head-to-head hits see game.

Anyway, hope watch full match soon wanted thank thoughtful reply. we'd speaking german second world war It’s significant. fact, Pfizer effective one shot Pfizer even better JnJ. UK currently running trial Pfizer AZ given other's boosters. concerns safety (we would heard were), expectation comparable effective either vaccine itself, know data released. Right. That’s point - corporate America culture needs serious changes.

Maybe takes. hope! Pfizer expressed confidence vaccine receive full FDA approval May 1  O:-) placebo vs real shot chart see separation lines around day 10 really start separating around day 14 considered earliest protection. I'm sure people exposed days prior testing maybe shave days 4 days seems soon. Fingers crossed end negative. get day(s) off? works standard 9-5 M-F workweek, try get appt late Thursday. good most/all Friday weekend wear off. read documentation healthcare workers vial contains 5 doses. 0.5 ml dose extracted via syringe gentle swirling. less 0.5 ml extracted vial, discarded new vial started. dose taken immediately patient area injection. punctured vial remains good 6 hours refrigeration 2 hours room temperature. thing though even one shot Pfizer better JnJ... can't getting 300 million people coordinate unilaterally literally anything unachievable policy relies objectively bad policy. Oh instead taking Oxford vaccine trying produce that. spent millions French one ended failure. late, ot one thing, bunch failures. Sad. Ecause EU well lockdowns measures, pointless now. [Hospitalizations trending three weeks. false information repeated ad nauseum sub. don’t actually produce sterilizing immunity. Even polio depends type take. Hey want say unlike crowd gawkers here, I’m going ask prying questions marriage stuff. wish good luck good health. Stay safe brother. We'll deliveries 5 million doses per week (plus Johnson Johnson) last week April. first dose Moderna Monday. arm bit sore yesterday afternoon otherwise I’ve fine. Yeah measure that? obviously went off-scale ridiculous make point. MANY modern religions traditions hold sorts ways thinking customs. point say hey, want live society gotta what's best everyone's health, getting vaccinated.  start January 6th though Every sub r/relationship_advice r/AITA whenever someone makes mild comment life. Jeez got first shot moderna!

I’m nervous side effects feel good decision get vaccine.  Wait, critical thinking common sense! Unlike people frequent sub ? Yeah lol honestly thinking that. sore arm first second response wondering immune system okay Moderna. they've usually got plenty time blame someone else \[ideally, person taking position retired/promoted faraway place, deal mess leave behind. Blaming predecessor getting things done go well public need cover person covered things up\]. well-kept secret sent Mrs. von der Leyen lead EU bearable Germany anymore ... problem alone anymore, problem everyone. submitted links two (2) articles, consisted short, accessible explanation.  auto-mod removed comments.  suggest copy title article, use google find explanations.  think submit anything here, while. limited workplace. sliver environmentalism, touch ""why ___?"" towards everything, desire exploit exploited could probably garner reactions peers. ""Why would play sports greatly increases chances destroying body?"" simple example. whole ""if everyone jumped bridge, too"" phenomenon. Yeah, I'm jumping. Gaijin question it.

I'm friendly work, misconceptions I'm there: Money want get. 

There's point forcing friendships feel lonely. selfish, waste time. Time commodified every day. 

A lot people made true friends since school. probably soon school over, person next competition now. bro hell wrong people, WFH SUCKS MUCH Seems like good setup! comes jab. way I'd trust vaccine coming corrupt company bragged record profits yet clearly care making sure things done properly. want get five year old vaccinated soon it’s approved age group, husband little hesitant. He’s anti-vax, nervous. Hopefully gets comfortable time it’s approved 12. Same, remember reddit skews young younger people side effects seems. Everyone 65+ know gotten barely effects slight pain. helps little choppy start US get organized. Got J&amp;J Monday, zero side effects. gym three times since. heard others reacted poorly got absolutely nothing. tk remember add risk mitigation. It’s popular cause people
Don’t want recognize isolation really bad kids. cause mental issue depression, lead long term issues. 

The real risk equation risk x odds risk happening VS reduced risk X risk mitigation. 

Example:

Risk long covid (5 cause everyone scared it) odds getting really low (1) scale 1 5 

That would 5 long covid

Mitigation Isolate kids 2 years (that would mean 80%) less likely to
Get covid, 1 risk) isolation. (Say long term permanent depression happens, let’s give 2 long covid bad good odds it’s gonna happen 4. get 8) take risk covid happening still 8 times 1 8. case covid less risk isolation.

The reward factor cause comparing two risks reward. trying mitigate risk decide go movies. one understand risk. want either mitigate covid open mitigation carries risk. got j&amp;j, side effects besides minor shoulder soreness (like 1 10 pain scale) two hours.

My wife got j&amp;j also, full body soreness three days.

No clue negatively affected. think main problem EU didn’t build production instead relied giving money companies everything. Vacation days? Nah screw I'm using sick time lol. lines pretty much 3 nurses know giving vaccine told me. mentioned ""it takes time careful misplace stuff!"" bit spread thin cramped working place (this pre-covid biggest fight admin). primary health center near big city another EU country, clarify since news German distribution. would imagine small amount doses, would problem GPs office. got vaccine yesterday felt worse getting actually covid back December. Wrong. flying China back January 2020 eeeeeeeeeevil xenophobic ban happened? not, wait. would get home otherwise without accompanied non citizens - private jets? Check facts.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide everyone know (10+) received Pfizer one side effects. two us including got monderna similar cold like side effects first shot. Could limited sample size? similar health type? 

I’m set get #2 Friday. Looking forward immunity. looking forward shot. 

Unfortunately, antivaxers use side affects reason get one. Yeah, definitely would fun infected COVID last second line vaccination clinic. kind documentation missing? main concern different composition? source info? 

I'm bit worried might get Sputnik 4 days.. like they're sitting warehouse. They're used. expect country give away supplies need. order later others EU spent much time committees talking it. Stopped countries ordering selves. worst world leaders moved faster EU did. Yes, exactly. Sealed, sterile syringes come vaccination site separately bulk disposed single use, course. Remindme! 6 weeks vaccines work? shouldn’t. wait another ducking month it’s end world. Indoor dining would mostly young people, 90% haven’t vaccinated yet. would lead spike cases inevitably at-risk people would come touch virus well. It’s weeks severely risk people 2 doses wait that’s happened. Right I'm picturing pharmacist nervously looking box J&amp;J vaccines queue forms, wishing paid attention administration training video. I'm hoping thats it. I'm 26 get sick often, worried long term complications getting infected COVID That’s impressive! Congratulations! dare parents need work support children raise? Yawn, sounds like bs. gonna die? No.

98-99% survival rate Sure, stay home lot too. That's choice make. option outdoors lot, kids. Nobody locked up. believe Target commercial showed somebody mopping pavement parking lot Pfizer Moderna effective UK variant OG. current vaccines work admitting sacrifice mental health millions kids 172 (not 2,000) died? care *those* kids, Mr. Tough Nuts?

I'm starting think argument actually *you* kids... Like said, state not, neither surrounding states also experiencing surge cases 10-19 age range. still mask mandates capacity limits winter surge. far tell, thing changed person schooling. like said, also coincides spring break colleges, cases decline. ""You came get vaccine shot, right? I've MFA check history known contraindications let's go...""

...technically, passed vaccination center process less ten minutes check-in leaving shot room \[a little due waiting line checkout\] - knowing german bureaucracy medical history, signed papers first waiting room ;) anymore, could also mean strong immune response due strong immune system realize several countries banned AZ least changed recommendations get it? Even UK says people 30 maybe get different vaccines. moderna makes first shot hell. sister laif week, family friend almost died.  us without exposure got headache worst first shot. That's untrue; Slovak drug quality control authority already requested help 30 EU laboratories, denied busy -registered- vaccines. Instead, tests done local certified laboratory. going average 200,000 people getting shots day rest month - Canada looking damn solid.

Just need ride next 4-8 weeks brutality VOCs. That’s pretty good Re: renegotiating leases. Lol. fucking if. When’s last time perused commercial lease? 

And keep saying “choice” means “greater capacity” - that’s quite right. Venues already legal capacities. We’re talking *restricting* capacity unless rules followed. There’s difference. course implied threats non-compliance. That’s obvious. 

The rest take. Man, sure. They’re plenty ethical questions stake. It’s cut dry. springs mind: BionTech, Janssen (J&amp;J) Curevac (to approved)

BionTech developed Germany vaccine produced BionTech/Pfizer

J&amp;J developed Netherlands, US currently supplied EU

CureVac developed Germany. rougly 4 3.81m average week 

So, yeah, adds it? I've reading J&amp;J side effects, I'm wondering, since fairly harsh reaction shot, indicate might covid? remember feeling slight body aches week two ago, cough, loss taste smell, think much it

Would way check retroactively? Buying vaccines dictatorship. could go wrong. Gotta gotta do. Ima let finish Portugal also 250 cases, nowhere near many vaccinated however! vaccines came saw great shift attitude sub. went ""I love everyone stay home risk getting anyone sick."" ""if get vaccine fucking dead me!""

Many people sub worried children, they're worried children still getting giving them. self-righteousness always been.

There's exceptions, obviously, major attitude change recently. username pretty good hint state average social circle 2 days moderate flu symptoms. worst 4 days. generally bureaucracy problem, simple fact limited vaccine supply. simply didn’t get vaccines. 172 .01% 2 million. 2 million 6 zeroes. 100% .01% shift 4 decimal places. take away 4 zeroes 2 million left 2 zeroes, 200. got second Moderna shot yesterday. experience first shot exactly yours. 

I took vacation days today tomorrow case got bad. Today woke headache arm pain similar first shot otherwise fine, took Tylenol went day. noon suddenly lost energy. ate lunch took hour nap. woke little sluggish another hour feel fine. Overall second hit harder still bad. French, confirm indeed mentality pretty much everything. July likely vaccines approved children teenagers, meaning even US still vaccination do. think late August US make rain everyone else. Again, honor contracts. renew defense production act Pfizer companies would able properly fulfill orders. open supplies all, Pfizer cant fulfill US orders cant get supplies contract. yet mods deleted factual statement emergent dumped 15 million contaminated doses needs check 62 million cross contamination. history lax safety protocols reported New York Times yet mods deleted information. Whats agenda pushed said mods can't post factual information people make informed decisions? According article yesterday, contract terms allow US redistribute vaccines countries possession. terms accepted rush sign companies wont renegotiate due handling liability issues. apparently hack around loan vaccines countries contract done Canada Mexico.  also want keep cart-wipes. care getting coronavirus, also really nice sick year: flu, mild colds, mysterious cough appeared one morning stubbornly hung around three weeks - nothing. *liked* getting sick!  24 hours post 1st dose Moderna: 

(I Covid December side effects hit harder first dose)

- Body aches subsided good bit

- Head still killing me

- Fever starting break. Sweating 99.2. 

- generally lethargic day. Slept today like 4 years.  anecdotal, Pfizer relatives got Moderna. I've mild side effects - sore upper arm day two, mild headache cleared Tylenol. people know got Moderna felt sick day two second dose. 

But said, get whatever kind vaccine available soon possible. Everyone know took Moderna fine within day two would get heartbeat. would 100% get Moderna (or J&amp;J) available signed up. get vaccinated - good. worry. crap shoot. chose J&amp;j spent night praying death. would venture say, someone who's gonna shitwrecked one, shitwrecked em all. Well, would mean Pfizer/Biontech vaccines UK Ya. It’s 80-90% two weeks. suppose real world test Moderna Pfizer work variants Ah, makes sense! Thanks explaining. Yea sharing vaccins. Thanks a*holes.

Congratulations tho. can't wait till too. loooong way go. There’s shortage vaccinations. Go online, find vaccination appointment go. Nobody checks conditions, etc. According /u/Wpns_Grade sub hivemind 😂. touch reality. know feeling NY seeing numbers go really end game.

I wish article details. sit around wait, one person allergic reaction could imagine others panic attacks something saw that? say 2 11 needed evaluation wonder. 

I super happy get one one done. appeals I'd go ahead get it. Aspen Pharma South Africa produce 400M J&amp;J vaccine doses locally African uncle early-onset dementia due trauma brain injury frightening see quickly declined. also heartbreaking inevitable would reach point time would require specialist care (he moved parents younger brother still primary school, shortly middle brother left gap decade - another brother already married time) could never provide. mobile enough get around fine motor skills irreparably damaged. also quickly became aggressive unpredictable - stretch brother live care someone disability used helping grandmother series strokes left partially paralysed.

Having watched brain damage dissimilar nature affected uncle, always cringe see head head collisions American football. lack padding affect rugby players much, lack helmet rules designed prohibit tackles shoulder height. slip catch someone around neck, it’s least 10 minutes sin bin. concussion tests carried accidental collisions, tackler -for whatever reason - connecting opponent’s knee. lift player tackle fail ensure lands safely, you’re automatically going receive card. doesn’t matter underlying intention - team play rest game (not merely 10 mins) one man tackle opponent way lifted feet allow land/fail intervene prevent landing head neck first. also can’t tackle moving towards player head shoulders first - arms must wrapped around target head shoulder hits (and hit neck anyway).

Worst I’ve seen date, since could’ve given marching orders.

I don’t think could deviated wildly topic thread TBH! interesting! 

Thank insight, see happens referring China, read quote context article again. dont think intentionally spread based current knowledge said, think trying cover ass look embarrassed contain fast enough. could wrong here, (admittedly abstract best) understanding low efficacy cited Janssen trials including several variants covered Pfizer trials therefore count Pfizer's 'rate'. 

I agree guy's statement ""one shot Pfizer better non variants JJ variants"" evidence support that, comparing 80-90% 65% far apples-to-apples comparison. there's evidence Pfizer effective certain known variants mean assume would've exact 80%-90% single shot efficacy rate tested exact pool variants Janssen one was. I'm saying Pfizer shot(s) 'effective', comparing two rates two completely different trials silly. We’ll see guess. Fauci said exact thing September 2020 time last year, look turned out. lot change.

A lot depend way child vaccination rhetoric goes. there’s insistence kids get vaccinated normal learning resumes, classrooms won’t full unmasked late August. every infant needs vaccinated. Moderna needs re-evaluate coronavirus vaccine safety trials tests. vaccine adverse effects, TOXIN wonder much money spent vaccines least phase 3 trials. AZ one time EU spent anything it. isn’t “funding science” it’s customer. - buying vaccines investing production research. 

You make sound like 2.7Bn Euros lot economy population size EU. UK spent £2.9Bn buying vaccines much smaller population. Yes paying higher price EU painstakingly negotiated. US spent several times much EU including massive amounts research production. Far dude I’m really stressing taking turn worse nowhere anyone mentions Lancet studies 91 % effectivity, Brazil Slovakia confirmed they've received different Sputnik tested studies. 

So far many details (from Slovakia), countries said Sputnik different dosage require storage different conditions, suspicious presumably solution.

The Slovak State Institute Drug Control said April 7th lingering questions efficacy risks Russian vaccine, due mainly inadequate data vaccine used preclinical tests clinical studies published Lancet journal characteristics properties batches vaccine imported Slovakia,""

it said statement. thank Turd-ew Canada domestic vaccine manufacturing capacity agree, easy decision. think wanted say concerns valid important help bit sharing thoughts. I’m avid pajama enthusiast Similar Poland look age vaccinated. many young people got vaccinated (teachers - despite schools closed apart younger classes later got closed too, policemen, prosecutors sime weird reason) older ones dying got chance. Gooooooddamnit.

I planning sending daughter kindergarten, part Calibama I'm in, many Trump cultists kids going campus super spreading. 

I want find would kids. 

Fuck... making casing mostly last data end March showed 54% population antibodies.

Actually data 14th March. we’ve vaccinated 10.7% since then, though obviously overlap people virus getting vaccinated. got jj side effects. workout smoke lot marijuana. course gonna different everyone majority population reason receive vaccine, kids top list. I’m sure isn’t understood. Well, obviously COVID vaccine authorized vaccine states people 16. True. consider edit supply issues easiest think off. I'm looking potential problems. 113 year-olds go first feel like whole AZ issue purposefully magnified make people EU scared make EU purchase Russian vaccine.

I think AZ higher blood clot rate virus, likely rate probably without vaccine. works gormless moron. Yall dumbass Europeans think know talking regarding US healthcare, ever even US? blindly say dumbass shit like that, reality Healthcare fuck ton better yours, maybe expensive bet ass much better ireland lol. say shit can't back Everyone knows came from. probe needed.... love seeing increased vaccinations. feel still states (Florida) increasing case numbers. keeps going up. yo yo hopeful depressed Health measures (I call restrictions) need place vulnerable people can't protected. includes children.

Targeting things like youth sports (a problem Michigan right now) schools would responsible health measure. Requiring masks settings risk also makes sense. going movies months early?

Several months year more. Vaccines 12s still good bit out. assume similar exit criteria adult vaccinations approach herd immunity, getting requisite case counts placebo group going become longer process height pandemic like adult vaccines.

And ""the prize"" bit talking school aged kids kept home avoiding socialization peers. Yes, it’s possible symptoms days mild symptoms. mom got GP I'm glad. That's one dose Could fixing toxic leaking lakes......nah, let’s fucking sue US government lose again. weird feel better randomly. Brazilian get shocked. followers blind, think wrong. That's fine, also ignoring stakes stunting young child's social, emotional, thus overall development. good adults lockdown handle it. way age groups like toddlers forced same.

It's adults mitigate risk everywhere else can.

But capitalist society beyond \*\*\*\*ed instead everyone, including toddlers, getting hurt. part better system working culture surrounding sick leave. unhelpful many people want show work sick even could take day without losing pay facing retaliation. What's wrong pajamas I’m sorry “young adult” anyone sense reality 18-30. 40 really want push scientific facts anything medical 18-30. “People choice” sound awfully entitled. don’t give choice. Vaccines general I'm fine with. one that's still effectively testing stage, especially one year old. We've GP ages now, matter talking available. Cue downvotes furious Europeans blaming everyone incompetent bureaucrats situation they've placed in. People work supermarkets wouldn’t happy wear mask day.

Extrapolated 112 year olds, like waste vaccine. presentence used doses hovering 75-80%. like there's huge backlog unused doses. Seems like usage rates production slowly creeping change graphs total US instead individual states. look ridiculously good age. Idk masks helping what. man even wrinkles 92, wtf?

Apparently need start eating hella potatoes gravy. worst case would someone needed priory pool doesn’t get it, contracts COVID dies. 'Insiders' part average people trying make vaccines insane conditions, sure, go them.

No one's asking sympathy. pointing incoming hypocrisy EU 100x easier J&amp;J AZ obvious geopolitical reasons. Funny see J&amp;J 'pathological liars'. comical lies things like Macron saying vaccine quasi ineffective elderly, Germans claiming 8% efficacy, Italy claiming they'd found 16mn hidden doses fact nefarious all. EU's blame-shifting chronic citizens suffered incompetence. no, things like wearing inadequate masks bothering distance, pointless theater getting shot. Exponential growth isn’t constant fear developmental inhibition parenting bring kids  got you.
[archive link anyone trouble accessing article US major vaccine producer worldwide export vaccines. Europe, India, Russia China exporting 50% Covid vaccines.

What's worse, US Defense Production Act also prevents exports materials needed vaccine production. disrupts international supply chain vaccine manufacturers depend on. European Indian manufacturers complained supply shortages due US export ban.

Having failed corona response, West allows China Russia gain global influence vaccine diplomacy. recently got second moderna shot wasnt advil dont think would made through. Without advil horrible pain bad lay still bed. Eating drinking possible either due nausea. could think much pain in. couple advils every hours could lay still bed relax enough even catch sleep. Also settled stomach enough drink water eat snacks. Like definitely didnt make 100% made bearable. That's reassuring, thank allocation numbers steady pfizer/moderna real shocking. J&amp;J doses seems slow roll allocations place (400k 5 million 800k week) Makes sense! experience WA big city sites ton demand fill really quickly, rural areas less demand diffused booking system, easier find appointment savvy.

There bunch people drove Seattle Yakima last days, even though Seattle multiple five-digit-a-day vaccine sites, they're booked up. with, Brazil's real IFR going substantially 1%. COVID-19's IFR 0.5ish% ventilators oxygen support available.  No, stop working second turn 111. working 1 hour second dose.

Arm felt little heavy, felt little bit foggy day. Thank you, too! I'll play part protect community. Even people seem care. United States here. got Pfizer dose 1 yesterday. choice wasn’t vaccine type availability proximity live. get ever one could. Look, people kids think they'd actually take care them. course horrible children died, children still low risk. mean less urgent vaccinating them, die, suffer health issues, might well protect them.  Seems like mods bit touchy. aren’t allowed call something dumb is? think last day significant lingering effects Easter. Here's hoping big week-over-week increase tomorrow. happened AZ shots, even careful making Covid shots mandatory, specially children. still taking it? agree balance things. I’m frustrated polarized it’s gotten many discussions seem end whether risk, rather measures aren’t reasonable take mitigate risk! No, haven’t all. mitigating risk children vaccinated. People like Bobby throw caution wind. practicing risk mitigation achieve herd immunity children vaccinated. Brexit derangement syndrome condition sadly vaccine. got second shot last Friday noon really hit hard. basically unconscious Friday got home work Sunday morning. extremely dizzy point turned head felt like traveling space. slept felt fine I've felt fine since. hell small price pay finally see family next weekend. Paywall Partially due reticence pandemic want start slow. Partially I'm letting science catch rapidly evolving situation. Partially due wanting see effective vaccine next months (does prevent long haul symptoms, well severe? There's mild cases still got Chronic Fatigue). Partially due young child can't get vaccine long time.

Basically, year. months playing safe continuing mask distance going make big difference life. We're going slowly re-engage friends family past year, see rush dive head first back normality...this pandemic over, stay vigilant bit longer. +3,458,709 since previous update Considering overpoliticized issue got there, wouldn’t disregard foul play behind claims “fake Sputnik vaccines”. Sadly party returned way ever finding out. seems like overall usage rate held steady. would seem indicate states taking longer report doses used, rather they're sitting huge surplus? e.g. Alabama getting doses could use, I'd expect % doses used steadily dropping. aren’t coming right conclusion. saying mitigation risk children unvaccinated appropriate. Bobby said didn’t understand anyone protecting children adults vaccinated, isn’t appropriate. Wait really, 85%? hit two week first dose mark next Monday. That’s incredible progress happen anything spread misinformation this? full-time job you? residents? Check UK Covid rates, started drop 2 weeks ago. Exactly. Yeah, funny problem. open cubicles WFH workers use came times came one free. taking people's desks away badge least 3 days week. one day week always made feel like saying ""Welp guess time go home there's set work today"".

Group meetings much better person, phone, one person talks literally cannot hear anything someone else talks. process multiple conversations better person. rectified everyone agrees respect speaker talk anyone. team one first go full WFH several years ago lead many others starting copy us. Never would've thought years ago I'd get headstart many never experienced last year.

It's true lines get little blurred, know many separate room work computer leave room they're ""done work"". adapted place home computer is, switch inputs peripherals monitors I'm ""at home"". 

It feel bad work little extra home since winding wrapping day put video something zone tasks. office, much ready get car leave even think work next day. PANTS! Yes. good social relationships make easier get raise promotions. reason rich prioritize connections. indeed neurological problems associated long covid younger cohorts probably terrifying prospect. Right. Makes sense, sounds reasonable experience. also mention definitely getting paid higher union gone somewhere else non unionized. initial point would never able move level I'm stayed unionized.

A lot guys took total advantage situation pretty well invincible. heavy focus seniority sounds like much better way run things. lived ND, 1/3 cars ND, 1/3 MN, 1/3 MB Eh I’d beg differ, bought first house last October... wasn’t even sure could handle moved 1 week quarantine began, longest 2 weeks life. miss house resources office don’t result grocery shopping janitor. I’m single becomes burden get point, think hybrid system way go take 2 cents w/ grain salt old department head used buy pizza everyone client meeting days. “We want everyone office show hard work” believe universal income. I'm staffing realm lots companies requires unskilled labor wanting work. Even 18-20 per hour jobs lazy fucks would directly say I'd stay home collect. team one made remote work permanent, recently. feel much like dodged bullet, I'd planned look another job forced return.

I'm legit sorry go back; going tough adjustment.  wonder people love working home mind employer transitions job Asia 80% reduction labor costs? I’m dealing thing. High risk elderly parent refuses get vaccinated. Almost like watched half million die year. crazy people calm... Damn. started going back office December.. :/    people aren’t rush get line current rhetoric “get vaccine go back lockdown life like good little Boy Scout”. Majority people aren’t enthusiastic “social distance even vaccine”. Unless start seeing ton people getting severely ill post-vaccination, rhetoric isn’t gonna work, even it’s right thing epidemiological standpoint. 

Some people legitimate concerns side effects effectiveness, since vaccines getting created approved usually takes longer year. Longer trials help doctors figure whether vaccine treatment stop disease longterm, whether unsafe side effects show months years inoculation. Since vaccines didn’t that, there’s big question marks surrounding asymptomatic transmission, side effects, long immunity lasts. pandemic helped realize working home aligned personality much traditional office environment. pivoted freelance never go back office. fully advocate employers give employees choice make working office optional. Yeah fukushima radiation really spread across world, least way ever noticeable except radiation detectors. mean clear wages least kept inflation, backdrop workforce growing massively women entering.

Secondly. Canada low vaccination rates, pushing dates shots norm, mixing vaccines shots. Lets rush use basis vaccine performing  Glad provide data. 

While may slight variants role definitions countries numbers may vary little depending tabulate, nevertheless clear US not, way, ""completely destroyed infrastructure general practitioners"". know, similar thoughts kids young vaccines. - vaccines oneself. also people cannot protect (cannot get vaccinated). Vaccines something individual common good. helped come decision want vaccine family.

The thought was. happens kids get sick - really sick - sickness could prevented. would feel get sick COVID (put sicknesses vaccine against) go hospital long term effects. would - essentially - fault. would like say everything health could. Florida's killin it. well put end theory virus arrived China surface imported good. also puts question claims “infected imports”. cool story Must nice able waste taxpayer money lawsuits go nowhere. 

The US Federal government well-established vast rights commerce public health individual states must comply with. See OSHA, FDA, etc. dont think hit J&amp;J boom yet reason. 5 million administered 10 million outstanding still.

Tried online translation, ""medical officers"" pretty vague. Forget it. wasting time trying convince mindless, xenophobic, authoritarian robots. Huh? vaccinated matter... huh, vaccinations really increasing way expected. hope federal government starts shifting allocations based demand. Even sending doses going countries better waiting letting doses sit shelves. think people feeling 100% fine second day would realistically miss one day work. states, like California, offering paid sick leave due covid vaccine symptoms check state offers them. EU? thought would reached 2 million first doses JNJ rollout. Ah, gotcha. side effects it? Mine body aches (nothing bad, exhausted struggled move.) napped like 6 hours getting home fine that.

Don’t peddle stupid advice comes vaccines. risk it? Don’t take it. Simple.

Thanks I'm like 90% good that, hitch could see would enough get sick hospital / health care system gets gummed up.

I think vaccine uptake going good enough numbers kind threat though. Makes sense, though wish article specified symptoms. Oh wow, read wrong. read 10x increase instead 100%. Sorry that. uk actually Europe done. It’s simple statement, come across aloof touch. People people completely done bureaucrat wag finger scold us washing hands, staying 6 foot bubble, wearing masks enough got 1st shot Moderna last week got slight sore arm. 2nd shot 3 weeks that’s we’ll see. Hard say, think people need make informed decisions facts know laid out. risk/benefit thing, judge someone wants vaccine want vaccine thats cost/benefit analysis, particularly novel tech. J&amp;J vaccine traditional though. Yep not. live downtown Cbus, mask distance everywhere. go bars wait seated wear mask anytime get up. nowhere near normal. Bars fraction normal capacity.

Just stay open late mean they're normal. gonna send tanks, like Ukraine?

Putin extremely sensitive perceived slight, like narcissist. hand, 6 months studying abroad happiest months life can’t wait go back. Yeah, would think virus evolve would need evolving response? ""The secret long life die!"" mean source lying? Where's evidence that? seen single source showing Sweden anywhere near Finland comes **population-weighted** density, we're talking Finland here. rest Nordic + Baltic countries? Well Finland, Norway, Iceland one Baltic countries seem stand sparsely populated countries Europe, Sweden Denmark Estonia stand among these, talking Finland here. 

Again, literally sent source showing this. want again, go: stay put let rest society enjoy next months. Nope, roughly 300k/day, still huge jump think it’s safe. likely production issues. Scaling easy. reason Pfizer/BioNtech best. Nah, much expensive run University COVID-times. testing insanely expensive, cleaning practices expensive, lack revenue sports on-campus activities tough.

Universities want open, desperately. arm mess 3 days Moderna. sleep side. anxiously waiting second dose. I've heard may comparable running full seed wall hitting without helmet. anybody confirm? forget AZ, half Swedish. Feeling this! four weeks making four-week TEFL course look short comparison (and felt like took for-fucking-ever done, lol).  working commercial leases past fall. ask?

Right now, legal capacity many venues restricted due public health orders. cases, venues could greater legal capacity implement vaccine passports. That's things are. We're January 2020, we're different situation different legal landscape. max capacity venues determined fire code longer applicable max capacity, due extant public health emergency. public health emergency over, venues able operate old max capacity local fire codes.

Articulate one implied threats, please. I'd love hear think left unsaid.

I still see much ethical issue re: vaccine passports reading article. Could result temporary lag people can't access vaccine yet able go events? Sure, could. also encourages people get vaccine (which good, design) far tell every effort made federal, state, local governments make vaccine accessible populations, expect disparity last long. possible populations hesitant get vaccine due mistrust government allowed venues? Sure - ethical problem that. Maybe I'm heartless bastard, give damn anti-vaxxer able go see Nets play person. 

In fact, article's conclusion actually supports point view (whoda thunk it?). article linked:
Government's Role
Hall Studdert suggest good place start United States government set standards reliable documentation vaccination.
Those standards likely proposed soon public–private partnerships starting travel industry moving entertainment areas.
Allowing sports teams, restaurants, businesses flexibility determining access reasonable may even encourage uptake, authors say. safeguards need put place around unlawful discrimination.
""Although driver's seat, government help steer,"" Hall Studdert say, adding particularly important private policies affect job opportunities.
That appears White House approach far.
This week, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden administration would make recommendations, ""we believe driven private sector.""

In words, author article thinks role government partner private sector develop exactly kind tool we've talking about, ensure tool implemented discriminatory manner. agree.

What else ya got? reason take exception would vaccines working well expected deaths hospitalizations failed plummet sub-flu levels even mass vaccination. 

Let extend further: deaths hospitalizations fail plummet *among people who've vaccinated.* lot adults refuse get vaccinated, COVID still ripping them, that's fault keep things locked them. No, EU buy 100 doses BioNTech/Pfizer. since companies allowed export, start, 100 million doses delivered. whole post doesn’t make sense, EU contracts never export provisions like US. 

Talk dishonesty ... Yeah definitely would seek true medical advice else. also feeling folks signing vaccinations aren’t properly answering screening questions might ask allergic reactions vaccines... might answer “no” they’re thinking “I want vaccine” fact should’ve answered yes..

I’m making guess though statement wasn’t based fact Son Venn Diagram Currently job hunting fully remote roles company decided require working office days per week starting later summer. I've done job well past year fully remote moved another state closer people actually care about. I'm going back office. America First means America Last, huh? We'll see place 2 months US 3-4 million shots day. Wonder rot hell choice yeah might work too. think paying people get shot would surprisingly effective  Chilean bit insight.
It's true they've vaccinating people fast rate (mostly Pfizer/Sinovac), restrictions almost nonexistent lately people also respecting them. last days (a week most) enforced quarantines country, actually checking people special permit go outside stuff like that. Before, supposed already quarantine (over month city) could go see people walking around, running, biking, lots crowded places... nobody even checked permit go out. complete joke.
Now control seems strict, hope numbers start go down, point still get people arrested organizing parties, football matches, etc. 
It seems young people (20-39 years old) believe that, since elderly already got two shots vaccine, pandemic over, also help beginning government put special enphasis elderly sick risk (young people felt like catch virus). would rather 24/7 office ukraine Idk, personally might need dose sugary goodness trek like that.

Anyway , want know, cases sinusthrombosis occur? first second shot?
I can't find information it! somebody help me? like smoke weed post Reddit. That’s quite true side effects. Mostly we’ll seeing aren’t INSANELY uncommon.

There’s little vaccine would “time delayed” side effect - typically happen repeated use substance. Rather looking “man hours” vaccine arms. that’s pretty high right - hundreds millions hours.

The serious side effect vaccines blood clots, dozen tens millions. Feeling great 8 hours post Pfizer first dose. slightest hint soreness arm, issues all. Guess we’ll find make work tomorrow.

Right understanding 30s told get another vaccine possible, still get vaccinated, neither 30 UK, I’m going based cursory reading. Remember Trump China, everyone said racist? never met co-workers barely interact daily basis.

It’s probably cars refused wear masks social distance. classification neurological psychiatric symptoms may actually proxy one myriad manifestations long covid19 - phrased important note clinical diagnosis anxiety may sometimes replace diagnoses (and hence coding health records) patients present ‘unexplained’ symptoms. phenomenon widely recognised #LongCovid patient testimonies.

&amp;nbsp;

**Early treatment reduces long COVID incidence**

It intriguing patients get early treatment - nearly zero get long haulers syndrome.

While sent away paracetamol - 25-30 percent become long haulers.

This observation 30-40 people - Dr observation 600 patients, Dr Steven Phillips best selling book author ""Chronic"" observation ie 60 covid19 patients none became long haulers - yet 25-30 percent said interview Dr Been.

So get ivermectin etc. - importantly get steroids day 7-8 first symptoms - likely experience hyperinflammatory stage causes vascular damage.

Vaccines may helping immune dysregulation, maybe even viral persistence. help organ damage - take time heal repair.

Early treatment still neglected strategy. physicians seem aware - others kept still think treatment exists.

In fact dominant dogma treatment exists - repeated months news media - informs patients home seek early treatment - many don't.

Suppression ivermectin part wider disbelief early treatment.

(link mentioned above: neurological psychiatric outcomes 236 379 survivors COVID-19: retrospective cohort study using electronic health records

April 06, 2021


**Methods**

For retrospective cohort study time-to-event analysis, used data obtained TriNetX electronic health records network (with 81 million patients). primary cohort comprised patients COVID-19 diagnosis; one matched control cohort included patients diagnosed influenza, matched control cohort included patients diagnosed respiratory tract infection including influenza period. Patients diagnosis COVID-19 positive test SARS-CoV-2 excluded control cohorts. cohorts included patients older 10 years index event Jan 20, 2020, still alive Dec 13, 2020. estimated incidence 14 neurological psychiatric outcomes 6 months confirmed diagnosis COVID-19: intracranial haemorrhage; ischaemic stroke; parkinsonism; Guillain-Barré syndrome; nerve, nerve root, plexus disorders; myoneural junction muscle disease; encephalitis; dementia; psychotic, mood, anxiety disorders (grouped separately); substance use disorder; insomnia. Using Cox model, compared incidences propensity score-matched cohorts patients influenza respiratory tract infections. investigated estimates affected COVID-19 severity, proxied hospitalisation, intensive therapy unit (ITU) admission, encephalopathy (delirium related disorders). assessed robustness differences outcomes cohorts repeating analysis different scenarios. provide benchmarking incidence risk neurological psychiatric sequelae, compared primary cohort four cohorts patients diagnosed period additional index events: skin infection, urolithiasis, fracture large bone, pulmonary embolism.



**Findings**

Among 236 379 patients diagnosed COVID-19, estimated incidence neurological psychiatric diagnosis following 6 months 33·62% (95% CI 33·17–34·07), 12·84% (12·36–13·33) receiving first diagnosis. patients admitted ITU, estimated incidence diagnosis 46·42% (44·78–48·09) first diagnosis 25·79% (23·50–28·25). Regarding individual diagnoses study outcomes, whole COVID-19 cohort estimated incidences 0·56% (0·50–0·63) intracranial haemorrhage, 2·10% (1·97–2·23) ischaemic stroke, 0·11% (0·08–0·14) parkinsonism, 0·67% (0·59–0·75) dementia, 17·39% (17·04–17·74) anxiety disorder, 1·40% (1·30–1·51) psychotic disorder, among others. group ITU admission, estimated incidences 2·66% (2·24–3·16) intracranial haemorrhage, 6·92% (6·17–7·76) ischaemic stroke, 0·26% (0·15–0·45) parkinsonism, 1·74% (1·31–2·30) dementia, 19·15% (17·90–20·48) anxiety disorder, 2·77% (2·31–3·33) psychotic disorder. diagnostic categories common patients COVID-19 influenza (hazard ratio [HR] 1·44, 95% CI 1·40–1·47, diagnosis; 1·78, 1·68–1·89, first diagnosis) respiratory tract infections (1·16, 1·14–1·17, diagnosis; 1·32, 1·27–1·36, first diagnosis). incidences, HRs higher patients severe COVID-19 (eg, admitted ITU compared not: 1·58, 1·50–1·67, diagnosis; 2·87, 2·45–3·35, first diagnosis). Results robust various sensitivity analyses benchmarking four additional index health events.


**Interpretation**

Our study provides evidence substantial neurological psychiatric morbidity 6 months COVID-19 infection. Risks greatest in, limited to, patients severe COVID-19. information could help service planning identification research priorities. Complementary study designs, including prospective cohorts, needed corroborate explain findings. site hasn’t approved yet, none doses produced used. I’ve heard hospitals may require masks going forward it’s turned surprisingly effective spreading disease. I’ll pass beer meh anyhow Ask doctor. working home years now. rather prefer choose positions allow work home. find quality life much better. originally decided work home since car. Commuting bus horrible. also less stressful. think remote work offer much more. see objection. 

If remote work continues, see better, consequences decline social life fitness. gained weight since walk less before. Even sit-down job steps decrease ten folds. time takes get ready, walk work, walk lunch, walk back work add thousands steps already active decrease drastically homebody like me. almost back pre work home weight. may happen everyone, possibility. saying, people able improve lives people worse? .  ^ ^ conversation, ""Fully vaccinated travelers risk getting covid."" kills everyone's confidence. Vaccines typically thought ""you get it, really worry smallpox anymore."" cdc could word better, least elaborate. Uh think managed graduate middle high school? people tiny apartments dedicated workspace live alone... I'm introvert quit freelancing years ago 10 years isolating. WFH last year challenge. get done days go office. WFH blows. Can't wait prison end. People unmarried alone household claim love lying something wrong. That’s blocking works all. talking about? EU ordered well Australia AZ way shipment EU, obviously need prioritize shipments.  
Also, thousands people die every day EU due corona - Australia. So, shouldn’t EU get vaccines paid for? 
Also, EU producing vaccines. 

And EU far biggest vaccine exporter world. Meanwhile UK US exporting ZERO approved vaccines. one talking that? everyone bashing EU, ALTHOUGH far biggest vaccine exporter world? Im Ontario, think teens getting september. Sadge took first office job years, go work real people absolutely wonderful. around people makes life worth living, even working. Maybe company charging much. want $80 20 N95s. variants don’t evade vaccines. expert ever said places both. I'm definitely strategic socialization shitting Japan know nothing us. really bad job. open?

What percentage American population represent compared Ontario represents Canadian population?

How many people one shot compared Ontario's?

All things think about. I'm introverted also spreadsheets show efficient am. Rutgers already it

A quick google says they're requiring Fall, FDA *should* full University require COVID-19 vaccine students enrolled 2021 fall lipids mostly sourced nearby Evonik. wide pending mass availability vaccines, Covid deniers reductionists essentially controlled pandemic gone. notion legit kept night. Hmm that’s good point. commercial real estate crash would hurt asset holders banks, smells like another “let’s bail banks!” situation. 

Or maybe we’ll see cities loosen zoning office space get converted apartments. Even legislative action, towards lot companies operate based states -- interstate commerce clause. They/He going face issues one ""banning political candidates social media"" too. peer reviewed study done lab US, blood samples 12 people vaccinated Sputnik V. One authors consultant Pfizer/Biontech.

Obviously Sputnik V developers shot study *A source close Gamaleya Institute, developing jab, told Moscow Times: “The Gamaleya Institute’s studies, based much larger sample 12 people used study, published May peer-reviewed journal demonstrate higher efficacy Russian vaccine versus novel strains, including South African variant, vaccines, including Pfizer.”* 

The study also found jab appeared effective preventing infection British variant virus.   100% correct! huge scandal, trust plant good job going forward given years long track record. clearly care following proper safety protocols. Yes, think rest midwest follow. hope not, think so. That’s true. Well J&amp;J it'll curious since plant makes dump 15 million doses due cross contamination Astra Zeneca vaccine, need check 62 million remaining doses contamination. company corrupt lax safety protocols plant, reported New York Times. Yeah completely understandable could see others something similar vaccines, although extremely effective, still 100% effective. There's reports people still getting ill Covid despite fully vaccinated. Throwing caution wind vaccinated completely irresponsible selfish. extremely high risk practically left house last year 4 months. I'm getting 2nd shot soon, even then, take long time go again, do, wearing masks everywhere go. 

I give fuck people think, anyone could unvaccinated, lying vaccinated (since vaccine cards pretty much worth asswipe counterfeited 5 year old). Everyone potential vector, that's on. Variants becoming dominant strains well, there's still much chaos happily run around without mask right now. things die later world gets better grip all, might relax mask wearing. honest, love wearing mask. I'm introvert feel home face covering public. I'm ugly anything, comfortable me. Makes easier wear one overall. yeah, I'm 'that guy'. I’m one hates working home. already isolated live alone. Working horrible. Don’t get wrong, would like option it’s 20 snowing, that, count out. need around people. asked b/c I’ve heard lot people asked pre-shot. Seems like strange question ask. Normally ask currently pregnant medical procedures, ever plan be. 0% businesses care people say would actually different;-) name left wing authoritarians?  post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* means densely packed cities. Got link backup claim? cells thing  case, actually don’t anything do, makes sense. taking could 30 hours office turning 60 like guy said, would far likely make things *worse*, better.

Although, tbh, love mostly-on-topic job, think would hate one much downtime. I’m social person. works you, great, everyone wants talk people much. Got first pfizer shot today, wondering side effects normal. got shot 6 hours ago, felt fine first minutes. next 10ish minutes developed following symptoms quick succession: arm got injection got little jittery (could muscle weakness, know common side effect), got hot, sweaty, itchy, edges vision went dark everything else got really blurry. alerted staff gave water sit little while, symptoms except soreness injection site weakness arm gone less 10 minutes started I've felt fine since then. kind adverse reaction avoid second dose rarer, ultimately unalarming side effects? Thanks!

Btw helps I'm 20s relatively healthy, super active  Yes? house great, got big yard, three cats, wife there. Also food way better wear pants want to. hell would want drive hour traffic sit cubicle, less comfortable get less done distractions instead? There's conclusive evidence linking D3 severity. connection speculative best, anecdotal worst. simply got lucky. second Pfizer shot 2 days, vaccines great. even think masks important whole time. feel like people going us wear forever sounds awful. exactly. never able work living space, struggled lot year. recently went back get much done feel better work do. Everyone know loves working home though lmao always feel alone hating Yup. there’s certainly many sensible companies won’t want employees third world country numerous potential reason (tho happen jobs), going thinking “if pay guy X qualifications 250k year work home NYC, wouldn’t pay somebody North Dakota exact qualifications 100k year job?”

It absolutely drive market prices jobs really wreck havoc people living high COL areas. You’re either willfully ignorant facing cognitive dissonance. Same, learned college needed get dorm room get anything done, went library. dorm room became place relax. People call working home; call “living work” instead? mean expected available 24/7, everyone personal cell phone seems problem texting hour day. Always working home bit hard me, want separation home work, time don’t want commute 5 days week. guess I’ll go office around 2 days per week get break work, still enjoy benefit wfh week. eating working quit mine that. know need people it’s pretty much unlimited overtime work it. work remotely want drive 45 minutes month dumb meeting remote reason us 

I called give two weeks didn’t want go back office make drive guy goes “you’ll need come office give writing”. replied well I’m want show tomorrow want show two weeks driving office reason anymore I'm torn ""yeah guess allowed to"" ""well I'm crying can't"" Nah, everyone's got variant. we're better taking world most. Yeah us don’t fun kind workplace Italy, Spain, Portugal worse Brazil well. REI sold [custom new suppose move covid started. Apparently FB bought it, already Seattle based building, wonder they'll require workers future. 100% workers actually quit. similar data points increase fully vaccinated people? Yep. Fewer deaths per capita US, UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal.

If Bolsonaro going accused Genocide, leaders countries. love this!

Can also pin top? sometimes get buried along way. Middle manager: going ask TPS report office?  Lmao called comment. I'm awful time management people office think I'm hardest working guy. stay late every day actually start work like 4pm would feel guilty leaving right 5. Ha sounds like never worked company outsources lot workers countries. I'm PM tech difficult worst workers outsourced. 10% great, vast majority garbage job. company outsourced workforce 100%, they'd business 3 months. I'm you, WFH year love everything it. Saved £180 p/m commuting petrol well three hours day travelling. get 7 45 instead 5 30 sudden find can't function four hours sleep night like I've always done, that's got good sign. 

I ill even entire year. extra time eight year old school closures absolute joy. work much better home work. office 4,000 people much easier work home. stress levels dropped floor I'm much happier life. company gets work me; mind working late sometimes I'm already home. office never wanted stay late would mean chance seat train home, even able board half time.

I really like colleagues enough risk wellbeing train rammed can't even move arms. never want go back office working, ever. 

And I'm late 40s guess fit stereotype! since Nov 2020

Also, US still higher new daily infections deaths per capita Canada Texas already went age, occupation, etc. last stage willing adults. not? I'm finding hard find information, I'd assumed EU countries gone Germany following WHO, Oxford advice (and EMA advice 4-12 weeks) AZ vaccine.

It would interesting EMA could tell us many cases developed second dose. demonstrated choosing neighbors flawed. 

You’re either willfully ignorant facing cognitive dissonance. Yeah government handouts destroyed business 🙄 actually concerning poor job media done illustrating bad things Europe well. Way many overlook this. hate working office, I'm ready go back - I'm WFH 100% indefinitely, what's stop management looking cost/salary spreadsheet going ""we could pay someone India 1/4th much""? Nothing. Working office sucks, also layer job security. dont disagree shouldn’t mandated legally still feel like private business able request anything want/operate freely. easily go next store. UK US contracts signed elsewhere.

Trumps order signed december 2020 statement false. Seriously go online university like WGU... free time, done sooner, debt 20 years... last checked digital vax pass available thousands years, stones throw away social credit system. company I'm joining part-time office, part-time home. say workers meet twice week office reopens. Probably boomers like stand around water cooler talk lawns kids both. role relies heavily engineers even ticketing pinging them, I’m nearly efficient prior pandemic. huge drop still notable. think hybrid schedule, like 2 days week office could personally help immensely. Full time office sounds awful though 🤮 guys get choose vaccine get? 

Here Netherlands RiVM &amp; Cabinet saying decide you, currently seems mean get AZ nothing all... Also knowledge got pandemic disease could scary contribute anxiety Yep, appears manufacturers don’t want let US share aren’t open renegotiating contracts allow it. i'd go place correct it. Commuting often considered major element job satisfaction, surprised hopefully people care shitty internet standards america. people dreading normality

People died, lost loved ones, many others lives ruined virus. frankly don’t much care people “dreading normality.” look suffering deaths resulted say “well, least made things good me” unbelievably selfish one cherry picking countries outside region. Got second curevac jab yesterday trial, little fever sore arm today headache, seems probably got lucky got real deal Go it!

Not even like ""go get one WEEK""

just like touch resume go jobs website sunday evenings hours something.

Eventually find something like, likes back. actually miss office Agree Amtrak better business class except slower. first job college around 10 years ago USA mean yea, home supervision able fuck repercussions pretty sweet. Also, *saying* quit actually quitting two different things. bet less 5% people claimed would quit would actually it.  Yes. wife giving team options hot desk throughout week. boss, hand, like “everyone needs back office July 1” Welcome middle adulthood, friends got married kids can't hang anymore, time hobbies, feel like creep going bar meet new people really hard focus learning surrounded social media, games, websites, etc. like trying get kids eat vegetables there's candy everywhere. kids, adults hard too. honestly see appeal working home. Never tried think would end really stressful end since I'd spend day home.
I find really nice office work in, clear boundaries work free time. really think vast majority workers fit criteria described? Google outsource top 5% absolutely outsource bottom 95 see opportunity so. already work contracted project managers, business analysts, database engineers, many many positions places like Ukraine India. folks good jobs American counterparts, absolutely taking jobs away Americans WFH becomes standard. Side note: *Saying* *doing* different things. I'll admit probably productive days gone office last year. However, tended 4-6 hour sessions, office ~200 people 10-15 given time, unnecessary distractions around. returned office full time week COMPLETELY MISERABLE SAN DIEGO. UK planning scrap cheques couple years ago, cheques barely used now, reason stayed older people may smart phone computer can't send instant payments online banking user need them. shops accept cheques pay extra want pay bills via direct debit (our version auto-pay). Yup, fda approved yet long term safety data, facts.  Makes sense

Blue checks Twitter nuts healthy food

This part I'm opposite on. Going office every day meant grabbing bagel breakfast sandwich, another giant sandwich lunch, chinese, etc. Working home like ""eh, I'll coffee... what's this? hard boiled egg? Okay, that's breakfast. lunch... piece leftover turkey?"" mean I’d rather kill work different strokes guess.  Hormonal milk growth vaccine rollout presidents   fine. Totally fine.

The trial vaccine included people got vaccine six weeks doses.

The problem going Walgreens, mass vaccination sites much enjoyable wait around in. **MASSACHUSETTS**, United States

You're right. that's hyperlink reference cardiological discoveries made Han Dynasty, instead hyperlinked reference modern cardiology China. piece What’s wrong saying China ultimately wants become world super power like US currently is. Many major players world fighting spot. China currently biggest player regard.

That is... literally saying. China, like Germany, United States, Britain, Japan, France, Russia, et al, trying become dominant superpower. say France, Russia, Japan, Britain, America, Germany want take world, there's logical reason say China Offering poor countries funding resources build infrastructure ultimately China 99 year contract runs cause way developing nations afford pay money back. 

If China spends nearly century helping nation develop society probably third-world country anymore, especially since China become wealthy since Mao's death. Regardless, every single nation Earth debt nations, yet owned nation, wtf logic last sentence?  ""Individual Covid-19 vaccination records private health information shared mandate,"" DeSantis' executive order quote, actual EO. Online internships sounds like shit, offense. Isn’t whole idea internship learn shoulder pick company culture? Hard zoom call lol. give €375 million grant

The grant given September, BioNTech needed money technical expertise April.

Pfizer gave grant mentioned funded 100% development costs Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. German grant funded, way came already developed vaccine late stage trials, factory Marburg. 77 y/o diabetic FIL still waiting first shot Ontario. Holy shit!!! can't believe one ever thought before!! going change everything! *Google Translate, activate!*

""It's group"" ? XD

guess things get lost translation don’t like wearing one. It’s annoying fuck. hot air breath dries eyes out. can’t understand people saying, can’t read facial expressions. list goes on.

Luckily job it’s required anymore. updates whether vaccinated stops ability spread covid? Doubtful, management blame something people office, something going wrong could never direct result management’s decision.

I bet solution management needs bonuses boost morale. even fill top part card got mine. wrote name birthdate I'm still trying figure put patient number. Selfish miss business travel alongside office - years I’ve gotten many free flight tickets booking client meetings thursdays-fridays staying weekend. 

Also, company card dinners RIP 🥲. interesting, manage that, privacy concerns? Theres lot pull favor employee direction. justification put people back office, WFH year problem. think people bold standing ability keep working home, still technically safe. everyone vaccinated, fucking dumb would tell people come back office wear mask dont feel safe? Headline bit misleading, article clarified Germany wants sign preliminary contract conditional approval vaccine EMA. Boston sounds like Boston. point need masks anymore. Maybe means 2 months, maybe means 3 months.

I get people hung though. Wearing mask seriously big deal. put one go outside even notice anymore. even work mask totally fine. Yes, eventually corona distant memory people wear masks anymore big chip shoulder? mask wearing kind torture? *cries disorganized slack requests* Good points. Theres also cohort people want get vaccine even FDA approved yet. Good, let quit loosen new jobs rest us primary job actually trying control bars around stadium normal year, trying keep souring vibe area around park (""community outreach"") decidedly low opinion owners first place.

His stories great.  They're ones keepin ass Reddit I'm talking driving. live highly congested city, quite populated Chicago. TX much way commuter rail, believe personal car reason.

I choose live city, spending years burbs. I'll tell 10 minute walking/bike commute lot better 1+ hours car used do. opening ~5 miles, think hard find reasonably priced housing within distance unless singly sustain giant family something. clearly different places like NYC Chicago, anything I'm jealous fact options driving. still getting live alone 5 minutes office. never ever want full time again. want *all*, would settle hybrid guess. Work work, friends socializing. Working/commuting america sounds awful Fuck noise! can't wait get back cloth covered box. I've telecommuting year, work extended least August. I've never felt less useful employee alone coworker. fuckin lonely. get done 4 hours home 8 hours office! feel way productive last year! million percent this. Ppl use work forced social interactions actual worst slow rest us down. 

Working home life-changing get much done without ppl constantly interrupting bored starved company. Oh boy, that, they'll need fire ineffective office drones offload work lower cost living area somewhere else.. 

.. since know people work remotely without issue! Win everyone! Or, least, everyone matters management! stop international traveling middle *fucking pandemic* Wait... what... is...... Idaho? Yeah, see that. advantages remote work undeniable, know want give office work completely. basically place got socialize meet new people, since work day, work tired anything. 

Maybe pandemic I'll able go energy work... HAH! early last jan stumbled story r/worldnews 41 deaths unconfirmed viral pneumonia china. Reminded SARS start following news daily. Late jan wife transitioned work home, bought masks supplies.

Since left home food runs. Havent seen friends family.

We got vaccine today. can't believe it. close end. going difficult transition back normal life. kids say going person school laughed at. Adults privileged. Yeah. Imma choosybeggar say Coors Pure. take Advil want receive vaccine. Trumo need world wide concerted effort made look bad explains lot. Yes.. telling someone can’t get 30000 year tax rent paid? Get bro confirm. company always opposed WFH they’re touting we’ve best numbers ever, productivity departments, people actually volunteering OT instead forced, etc. 

Yet haven’t given us green light remain permanently WFH. Fingers crossed move moved current location near building. workplace. ran office space put 6 people dept little beat house university owns. four us left bc one retired another took different job. 4 ppl dept pays utilities, grounds upkeep parking patrol. could sell property (it's residential area right campus), lease another dept tear use space something else. truly hope realize would much better financial decision us stay working home. think we'd fine give us shared desk closet occasions someone REALLY needs campus. waiting patiently plummet. know it’s around corner. sudden last two weeks almost everyone know city got vaxxed, including yesterday! cries Canadian

Y'all getting free beer (and krispy kremes) *incentives* get vaccine; we're begging shot government barely gotten around vaccinating 50+ best case scenarios Yes does. Flu kills, flu causes paralysis blood clots, sepsis limb amputations, scars lungs. incredibly serious disease dangerous 20 year old.

I trying downplay Covid, people understand deadly disabling influenza is.  knew...the constitution it’s trampled Well least US plenty guns play with... Well spring break morons coming place like northern states causing havoc person person type job pandemic they’ve cut unnecessary office visits. take truck home. Even physical jobs improvement less office time. MIL expressed concern getting vaccine due reason, research. Forgive I’m using wrong terms since I’m software engineer nothing biology - please correct something incorrect!

The vaccines inject proteins body say “hey, look thing called covid, fork like spiky things it, make something get rid it”. Thus body makes antibodies perfectly fit fork proteins get rid them. covid enters body already antibodies fight it.

The deal “infertility” comes proteins embryo sticking uterine wall. supposedly also fork-like structure, people think try get pregnant “embryo stick uterine wall” type proteins body, covid antibodies say “ah, fork like, get rid them!!” get rid them, thus allowing embryo stick uterine wall.

So now... here’s that’s untrue.
1) uterine wall proteins supposedly look nothing like covid proteins?? all?? Nobody knows claim came from??
2) Even identical body fight them, body gets actual covid also produces “anti-fork-like” antibodies. would see infertility issues women gotten covid itself, clearly hasn’t happening.
3) mom literally condition trying get pregnant embryo couldn’t stick uterine wall. kept trying get pregnant wasn’t working. Clearly I’m alive... give drug body trying do. 

So yeah, that’s what’s going on. think people hearing “infertility” getting freaked out, MIL one people aren’t bright even tried google would clue words mean. brings I’m gonna try explain here, we’ll see goes. keep tilting windmills. bad, misspelled lol gripE e. gripezinha gripe's diminutive  Still better almost every vaccine besides two covid shots. think expecting 60-70% Moderna bionotec knocked people people deem bad? crazy really used younger people since they're statistically better even without vaccine 60% 4/19

Just time eligible! vaccines go brrrrr. many work “friends” still regular contact longer share office?

If office friends important what’s stopping interacting meaningful, “friendship” capacity despite work home?

Sure seems thing bringing together literal physical proximity.

Being friendly people thing friends people. What? I'm talking Denmark capitals, talking closely people live together. actual source this, actually calculates entire country, average capital metro area, completely ignores rest country (Sweden many large cities example), could even inaccurate example lot people concentrated specific part metro area (simply put). i'm confused, people says already mRNA shots cancer, true? like thought covid first thing mRNA approved for. took global pandemic push employers remote work, technology made feasible years. cat’s bag really incentives go back cubicle? information mgmt previously, time. 
The amount people agree project procrastinate months, thinking casually ask thing end day hanging office door get away it...is lot. 

When I'd ask official email request could cc parties on...they shit themselves. experience, older generation wants see butts seats.  Wow, can't imagine still going lockdowns. would going crazy. live area US extremely anti-covid precautions, hate people forgo basic common sense, kind grateful deal that. numbers actually really low since everyone either got virus vaccine point. I'm curious much marginal benefit lockdowns really bringing point. hope Moscow Times first floor. Penalties group stage? Angry isn’t even right word, I’ve work 3 times worked 6 last 14 months hit end stay home order.. essentially set life back multiple years haven’t able save money advance workplace Everything. never reason bash Twitter. now...which means will. 180s Tony Hawk. Again, matter kids get vaccinated die. really waiting people, going normalize type behavior forever.

Also, yes, less students, get less funding, unreasonable. absolutely reason virtual next year. Unions good side bad side. depends situation, lot good sure. unions also means everyone rules makes negotiations like remote/flex time really tough org ok job go remote others. Also, new employee pretty guarantee get fucked lay offs. Essentially meaning circle protected people keep protected lay offs, thats super cool. Sometimes factors seniority play. Oh thank goodness, never visit Idaho need lug vaccine card along. vague ""there may side effects"" statement European countries clearly honestly laying many died blood clots, know it. 
 
Why problem governments honest vaccine deaths figures, exactly? think people ""shut they're told""?  Naa we've like 10 years already rare since hardly anybody uses cheques. Omg Canada years already. started government cheques due easy verification since moved nearly cheques. (Do know personal handwritten cheques though they're commonly used anyone life) alternative living somewhere cheaper, lots jobs available bay area available cheaper areas

You could live somewhere like Tracy Stockton, even still expensive commute one worst country. 

Leave California realize jobs arent there. 

I say, could def find cheaper 5,000 month san jose, enough make difference. wanna include food, parking utilities, yeah, 5000 accurate Nope started new company 2 months ago bc old one talking making us come office. remote boarding, mailed pc, video meetings, that’s it.

that’d feel sick bet heh Yo automod, political post? would absolutely *say* I'd rather quit, feel like luxury actually following it.  Californian - working it. 

We making double-mutated strains! give us little time. countries ones testing. depends purchasing power. US clout ask pharmas local testing want access market.
Other countries might use tests results approve own, demand testing pharmas Testing elsewhere.

If testing particular country situations might merit testing, also opportunity so, I.e. Variants, health, age genetic predispositions composition given country. well, know, spring break, look got us twelve months ago quit going back office. office packed like sardines I’ve working “quiet undisturbed setting” 40 hours week home. find funny wanted make sure there’s distractions want office packed around 50 people 10 hours. quiet, undisturbed. fucked bought big building corporate building COVID don’t want use assholes. 

We “on queue” (working) least 8 1/2 hours shift (85%). averaging 95% working home start work that’s time for. don’t need breaks, I’m fucking house underwear whole time. walk around computer talk people help them. office literally none that. sit uncomfortable chair around shit ton people talk using 2 monitors (not necessary unless you’re 🤪).

Fuck going back office. unions great. Like anything else, greed screws everything. good though. People different. need freebies, need fear, need caring others, need laws, need punishments.

60 thousand year rent Something annoys work currently they’re trying get feedback workforce remote working compare remote working (in lockdown) back office (when weren’t lockdown).

It isn’t fair comparison. can’t go work moment, go gigs, go eat, go hang family/friends properly without feeling guilty. we’ve got side life back balance, remote working dream.  problems use Advil second dose vaccine?

In fact, they're saying 30 blood clots (which already mentioned post) rather true figure 79 clots 19 deaths, proving point even more.  
 
Like say, suddenly find 50 extra clots last week since post? No, lied it. wanna scrap them, particularly large recurring payments like rent.

Thanks humanity I've generally staunch critic EU many reasons, practical ideological, I'm definitely part ""EU perfect"" crowd. However, situation, regardless whether ""knew"" countries would do, regardless whether US backtracked serve started selfish get go, EU's policy one cooperation. prisoner's dilemma, that's generally helpful players fundamentally selfish, even knowing that, still started principles cooperation rather protectionism.

That said, I'm familiar details efforts ensure steady vaccine supply, infrastructure (though, say, comes infrastructure, would probably get precise useful analysis looking individual countries, EU whole). good sources ameliorate issues, even compare efforts countries, I'd interested see numbers say. COVID. believe one Michigan 13, I’ll try find it’s updated I’m wrong I’ll still try link originally saw could go Sri Lanka, he's vaccinated. recently (earlier week) announced vaccinated travelers come negative PCR test freely travel country. really, get there. don’t need though advice US rollout, despite campaign certainly impressive, it’s success almost completely relies banning exports. Europe done same, would much closer US already. would love to, dont company. manager say pay scales. Thanks sharing info! Supply low, also concerns keeping vaccines cold enough, build huge centers, low supply ran full capacity far. Also priorization age groups risks lead inviting lot people get vaccinated never responded went invite next group. 
In retrospect done differently, main goal always get many people vaccinated possible prioritize hard did, really main problem always supply, ironic, biontech German manufacturer... 
I personally think leaned family doctors start, know patients, risks medication, valuable opinion. can’t agree more. second schools reopened, youth sports activities too. everywhere mobbed. I’m vaccinated everyone live too, boy increase stupid around live. Ok. Yeah. Sure. even know bother coronavirus subs fucking type person. Work home superiority complex. super helpful, find website point allowed search different pharmacies tell vaccine they're giving out. remember site hand, correct Walgreens went giving Pfizer. I'm sure tough find. that's positive spin verging propaganda. EU promised manufacture vaccines rest COVAX nations South Korea, Canada, Japan, etc., charging price beyond price procurement aka net profit. EU suddenly implements export ban, would basically giving ultimate middle finger. EU said export way America did, countries would months build vaccine production factories. Instead, EU volunteered promised produce vaccines countries return awarded contracts made profitable employ many Europeans result well.

**- Enough adults vaccinated first week June (6/4, 57 days) reach 70%** 
\- Enough doses given cover half (\~50%) adults end April (4/30, 22 days) sure flu covid? flu super rare year, like *super* rare. It’s maddening&amp;demotivating. It’s. Just. So. Obvious. People. Please!!  .... except mask mandate, may last Fall.

Great. mass vaccination site Commerce City, Colo., suspended operations Wednesday almost dozen people reported adverse reactions getting COVID-19 shots. State health officials quickly reassured public, saying there's reason concern people vaccinated day. spokesman Centura Health, administering vaccination site state Colorado, said number people fell ill amounted less 1% 1,700 patients receiving shots day. Don’t need opinions, thanks. asking information, knob try live superiority complex.

The information taken part would considered reputable sources there’s still lot news coming time.

Children can’t get covid, risk, Maybe risk, definitely long term issues, vaccinated, maybe vaccinated.

This example communication country, one issue. add different topics different vaccines, risk groups, efficiency etc suddenly drowning different statements theories, facts old news.

France hit 10M vaccines _2 weeks_ ago. nearly 12.8M Tuesday's numbers.

I think headline means say France hit 10M people received first dose (though official numbers still 9.562M). kids autism died what? COVID  vaccine? That’s Notre Dame too, school requiring current semester since it’s difficult get places. university giving students it’s mandatory yet low steady COVID prevalence forever, college anymore?

I think year two, widespread vaccine availability, time learn live it.  Vulnerable people take precautions, before, world needs move point. sounds like normal Indian wedding There’s huge difference “the vaccines don’t work quite well” “they don’t work all.” Moderna Pfizer efficacy rates 90%, slight dip effectiveness isn’t anything worry Texas Rangers game week hopefully result surge *hopefully* make people realize outdoor mass gatherings going cause apocalyptic waves COVID. don’t really understand you’re getting at?

In fact mask sick good thing.

What really needs change middle management culture infests America. “you work even you’re sick” type manager. need go. Pfizer vaccine 52% effective first dose 95% effective 7 days 2nd dose.

Yes think working make 3200-3600 month plenty save live get knocked 1600 month lol think it’s okay change behaviors accordance public health guidance, attitude “I’m vaccinated let’s move lives,” isn’t really helpful. lol “you people.” guess think risk collages there's far risker stuff, even healthwise pop WAY damage covid population. Menengitis something spreads colleges, get it, really bad. Entering college there's almost certianly overall risk bad case menengitis, bad covid outcome. Also, really thinking accidents commong much higher risk bad outcome compared covid. 

Really, interesting there's MUCH riskier things people think twice it. comes covid, put risk category often match reality thinking health 20 year old vaccinated student.  found original post incredibly condescending, I’m sure shifting blame towards here.

„You US way aren’t enough doctors!“ numbers clearly show isn’t true ... well, condescending. Different countries different solutions. “normal-ish”

I know feeling. hate masks. Hate them. wear one already every 12 hour shift end day last thing want see dumb mask. Especially leaping opportunity get vaccinated January, hear “oh sorry masks required maybe 2022.”

Made mental health way way worse. fairly common sense requirement colleges have. problem showed proof. Cute. 0.7 mil doses. 

BTW, EU exported 100.000.000 doses around world, including poor countries, thousands people DIE EVERY DAY corona!

It could long-COVID is, cases, residual virus hanging on. vaccines, especially mRNA ones, force immune system pump nothing really fight. seems like scenario body would good chance clearing anything left.

Then it? part, assume, EU officials aren’t beholden degree nationalistic population currents US politicians are, fact lets enact policies international cooperation betterment people without facing less certain loss next election. Let's see, getting vaccine infected without showing symptoms higher chance. number also includes vaccines sold. hate US.

Deeply passionately. Oooh yea, give Fauci Ouchie. Moderna JnJ? We've giving loads loads people 50 US. Seems strange specify Pfizer. Yep. also everything else.

PS. Apologise sounds like lecture.  author seem see parallels 1) countries able determine people need order enter borders, 2) private property owners/business owners right determine people need order enter property/business.

The [NY Excelsior instance, actually government program prevent unvaccinated people participating society. mandated businesses use pass check peoples' vaccination status letting venues whatever. Instead, uniform tool businesses choose use order ensure they're keeping staff patrons safe pandemic that's already killed half million Americans past year still ongoing. Oddly enough, Republican-run states (Texas, Florida, etc.) infringing business owners' rights mandating allowed screen patrons ensure recent negative tests vaccinations.

Your opinion worth assuming made best reasonable effort get there

they UK higher priority contract.

it doesn't.

Stop wasting oxygen tarnishing image Danes. Good points. Anyone dying quit jobs come back office, fine, go, good luck! I'll happily take promotion empty desk. 

And really agree small daily social interactions healthy you. Small talk muscle exercise, people thrive basically prerequisite leading big talk new connections. office best/easiest way adults make friends, virtue shared time, like back school. Nothing else hands long stretches passive time random humans like that. builds bonds. Yeah.

Instead needing shower right wake go work, work hour two first meeting day shower want. part saving time. I’m one avoiding safe proven vaccine haha Despite vaccinations going well things opening according schedule UK that's enough right-wing press (despite 150,000 deaths). almost like they're desperate mess things despite end within grasp.

Personally suspect owners vocal newspapers etc. UK lot money invested commercial property and/or retail/hospitality sector. enough vaccines supply properly, centralised approach taken (through centers). Even operating full capacity yet, expected enough supply soon, started give vaccines GPs well. Wife got J&amp;J today, I'm 7 days past second Pfizer dose. get kids dosed up. daily total... Transmission still important. Obvisiuoly current vaccines great plenty good enough. things always better margin. say ""well things good enough need study vaccines combinations"". UK getting hit hard virus doses exported, still exported nonetheless. Almost UK AUS rest developed world allows businesses run contracts, declaring ""I've decided need I'm stealing it"", EU does. Really? pushing back genuinely didn’t know that. Small sample size? They're professional actually. signature finger/gun pointing move allegedly even show they're anything wrong hands - easy child entertainer.

They're also surprisingly decent musicians - here's [Tame Impala yet see it. It’s people got partying Spring Break. situation factored evaluating ""best effort"", guess. You’re really assuming without knowing full story? Damn I'm TN similar situation here. Typical humans* Fauci says good news: upvoted

Fauci says bad news: downvoted

truly 'following science' folks. 70% adults want plus \~15% existing immunity get us close beginning June.

The CDC estimates 25% Americans Covid think guess far off.

And, good point declining death numbers. Ah nice still receive vaccine though. think may bit naive respect. think compassion others common sense mean everyone else does. That's almost scary COVID. Seems like people far between. real world things mostly seemed return normal live. Masks probably start disappearing major retailers starting month (here Alabama least).  One thing mention dentist (and say yet causes B) cause periodontal destruction bone loss presence gum disease pro inflammatory cytokines. thing causes “cytokine storm” Nah, work known variants. Oh still mini-lockdowns? seem like something sub would support.

It sounds like great future look forward to. BioNTech/Pfizer supply less 1.1m per week March 2.5m per week April another rise May/June hit 40m Q2 altogether. EU countries see similar increase supply.

Among deliveries first vaccines produced BioNTech's new Marburg plant, started production mid February. might go Delpharm France Fill&amp;Finish. surprise, considering we're preferentially vaccinating elderly. Eventually far hospitals, capacity taken younger COVID patients peak crisis would likely left convalesce homes. risk pretty tough sell 0 risk nothing - considering COVID eliminated Australia life normal right now. 

This correct move keep highest confidence vaccines.

Alternately, let families people die sue taking medicine killed them. effect efficacy? still protect immunocompromised somewhat DEADLY VIRUS. think AstraZeneca chooses do

Gee wonder burning desire prioritise people who've viciously destroyed reputation purely shift bit political blame? Maybe, maybe, blindingly obvious explanation denying months true along: EU made shitty contract them, powerless force AZ anything, given EU totally soured relations top all, there's reason AZ divert supplies elsewhere help EU. additional word US going states started seriously lag behind vaccinations? I'm surprised Southern states behind saw article week back said Mississippi enough staff problem. Adults giant kids though. whine cry things can't have. want hard work get want. can't segregate vaccinated vs unvaccinated people stupid. People jealous. People selfish. People vindictive. can't nice things. manufactured American machinery. 

Hahahahaha! Oh, boy... I'm saying UK would still access vaccines less course had.

**NO!** fucking told since desire play game best reasonable effort

Because stupid english? AZ **tried** deliver. couldn't! That's required do! **TRY!** fault plants can't produce much expected, assuming made best reasonable effort get there, UK higher priority Q1 2021 means limit saying talking bullshit.

Yeah, **TRY** deliver this_much Q1 2021. what. **did** that! it! EU fucked up. 

AZ vaccine shit anyway, good riddance. “open up” cult sub also “no way hell verify vaccine status!” cult, really ends thing. one overkill.

Not dangerous, totally unnecessary. love people assuming something without facts, typical reddit. doctor crazy CDC says it’s totally safe immunocompromised. Actually recommend first half, going lie. Totally unnecessary, dangerous.

What manufacturer made flu shot 2016? 2017?  politicians even put fucking goal posts.

What's problem? like facts? even read contract? can’t they? now, supply limiting vaccinations, medical personnel.

I think title thread created confusion point. word ""allowed"" makes sound like general practitioners (artificially) forbidden administering vaccine, bottleneck, removing restriction made difference.

I realize central authority controlling vaccine distribution, general practitioners cannot inject vaccine have, indirect way, allowed. incorrect use word ""allowed"", also clear say way. daughter freshman college fall, admitted awesome engineering program. program joke freshman year normal circumstances. hope true resources available succeed.

Older customer last week: hate leaving house virus shit can't get need online am. First time I've left house weeks!

SAME customer today: long going keep making us wear masks? trend continues, might able hit herd immunity (varies, often around depending source) early-mid June, honestly lot sooner expected early pandemic. Also, expect deaths keep declining, elderly mostly vaccinated hell wrong so-called experts? saw [this apparently anything lower 90% vaccine coverage means ""it might matter redefining concept ""normal"" life"". 

If new goalpost France (and likely rest Europe see comments supposed experts like soon enough) whole continent seriously fucked beyond repair shit like increase apathy hesitancy towards vaccines. shortsighted? Please stop spamming unrelated things would time release matter? makes even worse cannot even provide proper documentation... Finally vaccination professionals - general practicioners - get done decades, vaccinating willing population.

I start vaccinating people practice next week, might cry little tear happiness... Could DM newsletter link too? :) guessed Tennessee among top. sure EU supposed profit? lol goes 'non quarantine' arrival shit day ago I've got several friends hesitant vaccine back first approved.

Half vaccinated now.

It happen. Amazing. Congratulations guys idiots signed fucking contract? Seriously? freaking common knowledge expected know!

There **no** ""Deliver much date"" language fucking contract. spouse works vaccine clinics said recently they've issues younger people coming eaten breakfast yet, least 4 5 people passing every day, shots

Wonder something similar going here, especially ""given juice water"" going home thing True, people dying COVID ICU. deaths increase, demand ICU increases start people die ICU space even opens up. Kids dont really face much risk Covid asked source unsafe people. vaccine less effective someone doesn’t mean exempted getting it. said people can’t take vaccine didn’t back up. claimed would less effective Michigan peak cases per day given history may getting worse still. Hospitalizations approaching peak. Deaths per day doubled last week acceleration wave seems place. holds could 100 deaths day next week.

Near states (oh, in, il) showing rise hospitalizations. indiana match rising cases. tell us? testing enough Indiana there's probably hidden rise infections. Illinois Indiana steeper growth curves. Ohio hard tell, since smaller border smaller metro areas near Michigan makes sense.

MN state watch one largest rises.

The good news places like california Texas well. nationally case counts low. reduction restrictions places leaves us open reversal vaccinations pick people mingle unsafe ways. lag reduction guidelines clear surge 2-3 months, probably virus seed people immediately return normal en mass.

The cdc continues say health measures vaccines important. Wear mask. Distance. Vaccinate. nothing *bad* risk management. everything specific situation, saying otherwise calling someone parenting decisions without knowing situation. Passing judgement that's something do. ever kid ICU reason (I have, COVID related) nothing want parent deal with.

There's way hell I'd send kids back person right Michigan rampant thing spreading nobody knows why. Hospitals filling younger people (like 20's-40's). we've confirmed we've reached herd immunity, mainly hospitalizations R number dropping floor, issue, want kids vaccinated. Luckily they're 12-15 range hopefully sooner later, time school starts fall least. one stupid actual deadlines contract, dude. gods sake, know this? 

There absolutely *no* ""Deliver by""-date freaking contract.

Canada covid deaths per million = 609

US covid deaths per million = 1,669 Downvoted without anyone saying link covid fatigue. solely covid? also host things? ultimately game risk. Companies never done business another country going jump head first unknown market. companies worth billions dollars, corporate risk departments hundreds lawyers yelling daily basis. right, acted safety officer explosives field I'd say thats you.

Simple example, aware aids one year would told got flu like symptoms little back normal.

There many studies pointing long term issues people contracted covid. reports early asymptomatic woman Brazil lung xray clouded like walking pneumonia. 

So risk assessment such: vaccinate/wear mask/limit interactions get pray everything OK. Afraid dont see ""Jesus taking wheel"" valid strategy. 

So yea, people find vaccines masks vile get them, means go life, wasting time so. recognize know shit till slapping face, proper risk management isolation, masks, vaccine, combination certainly wasn’t true mass drive-through Moderna clinic volunteered for. Shots drawn batches directly vials, actual administration took less 30 seconds per patient. drawing process require attention detail, don’t want underestimate skill required nurse administering vaccine itself, it’s lengthy process means.

I think Pfizer vaccine requires dilution, likely extends prep time required, though? oh okay see getting tested weekly? always advised people symptoms get tested.

Not NY. NY telling anyone everyone get tested regularly long time now. Wrong, there's plenty pandemics last 100 yes go look up. None unprecedented True, restrictions terms taxation lax enough even entities explicitly started joke count church, e.g. John Oliver's Church Lady Perpetual Exemption. terms SCOTUS rulings really formal definition counts religion; I'm trouble finding case something ruled valid religious belief.  read changed vaccines.

Sounds pretty bogus me. long US production facilities used capacity (they are) setting aside capacity vaccines may never approved.

Seems like sour grapes money instead genuine concern getting shots arms. Sooo what's point requiring next year? makes legal scientific sense. located? Still tough PNW means uptake high great think another firm charge trials, production distribution.  Masks might technically “mandated” honestly who’s going enforce it? someone walk grocery store fully vaccinated July August without mask long every employee vaccinated, would really bother confronting? think they’ll quietly go away shortly June. Antivaxxers (PRIVATE) university: can’t forced get vaccines! violates first amendment rights!

Literally anybody knows law: still here? suffer? 

(Yes someone actually said first amendment thing Instagram question sticker) Yes Yes and? Oddly enough allergies terrible year even wearing mask 8 hours day I'm sure. stupid people don’t stop stupid. got Pfizer vaccine (both doses) Friday I'll 2 weeks fully vaccinated! seems consensus US oo listening medical podcasts, pfizer, j&amp;j, moderna work great anyone get vaccinated soon readily available buddy got JJ shot described pretty much everything went through. got first Moderna shot dealt sore arm two days. get second Moderna shot next Wednesday. Sounds like I'm fun. Good know! curious this. teach elementary school. really, really hope vaccine gets approved children quickly. Every day see comments adults saying refuse wear mask vaccinated. shocks - fully vaccinated continue careful. There’s still chance could get mild case pass someone might become much sick. kids fine, all. sooner get vaccine, better! found Variant California supposedly resistant vaccines/antibodies. sure risk low claim Hopefully. really messed up. wish someone else chosen. compare 8th grade college? fair comparison  K Maybe read article headline. doses exported February March. EU invested 2.7 billions 6 vaccine developments. AZ one them, way. Ty much advice, think ever full blood work done. Though [the US testing ~6x per exactly fair comparison. 12 days first dose

Need clear mean ""after first dose.""

52% basically average across days first second dose.

Treat completely unvaccinated 2 weeks out. really itching something, play safe next 2 (or 3 Moderna) weeks really solid immunity. Nobody knows needed. vaccines different effectiveness, variants (some might exist yet), already covid, count kids can't vaccinated, lot guessing factors, anywhere 40% 99% vaccine coverage could required.

Sad , heart goes every parent lost child reason! don’t see says children autism likely die. know preexisting conditions children adults leads higher risk complications COVID. 20 doses per 100 inhabitants, four times number confirmed cases. Good! fairly certain given shot someone isn’t medical personnel. US army operating facility.

Medic common specialty military, many soldiers reservists significant medical training - exactly situations like pandemic! Continue push people get vaccinated. Sooner get herd immunity, sooner masks come Stop projecting. Every single person America privileged. Ted Cruz born refugee camp Somalia, probably gotten Ivy League school.

Category 5 EF-5 hurricane Sharknado impending doom, thanks, Dr. Osterholm bureaucratic process Germany doesn’t allow speeds like that. IIRC, doctor sign 7 times per dose (which insane ask me), patient explanation risks. Stuff like takes time. COVID-21 Electric Boogaloo hope would understand didn’t announce fall plans explicitly stating rules everyone already vaccinated think originally. Michigan seemingly pushed surge 2 weeks original projection, may pushed peak well. honestly show sign slowing down. far aware, US completely destroyed infrastructure general practitioners, Germany, vital functioning system brings medical service even smallest communities.

This isn’t true all; US “primary care doctors” “family practitioners”, general practitioners different name.

Germany ~66 GPs per 100,000 people; US ~73 primary care physicians per 100,000.  I’m curious see comparison side effects three vaccines. received J&amp;J vaccine yesterday afternoon (the one-and-done shot). arm/injection site totally fine, rest much. 10 pm last night experiencing chills, dizziness, migraine, joint aches, 102-degree fever. Fever finally broke, rest generalized body aches pains not. people know who’ve received J&amp;J experienced similar side effects. Anyone else receive J&amp;J similar side effects? none all? Everywhere? like... get bus. get get different bus. every time go shopping neighbourhood store. ordering takeaways. taxi. Everywhere, basically, right? would insane queues would create everywhere would waaaay worse lockdown economy. 

Vaccinations required places submit proof beforehand allowed entry based said submission prior arrival. see supermarkets implementing process sort, slightly automated everyone checking gate every single time there. Major events, though, fall ‘planned trips’ know occur time submit proof online admitted go worry-free without delay check-up gate 100% ask proof vaccination(think concerts, football games).

And yes, school enrollments. P1 variant? asking cause one concern. Smart lazy employees realize purposely underperform avoid burnout.

I feel attacked. reddit number people hospitalized COVID-19 21% higher start province-wide lockdown, ICU occupancy 28% higher (Figure 1). percentage COVID-19 patients ICUs younger 60 years 50% higher prior start province-wide report, issued Wednesday Centers Disease Control Prevention, found — countries — oldest patients greatest likelihood dying hospitalized. 508 patients known hospitalized, 38 percent notably younger — 20 54. nearly half 121 patients admitted intensive care units adults 65, C.D.C.

That’s eight sources I’ve given y’all. reply (not I’m asking to), observational science isn’t synonymous “anecdotal,” fyi. see, really interesting. Yeah, suppose size island kind makes hard grow, rest world huge. Thanks lot reply. could well younger people don’t think much certain symptoms well, causing lack reporting. Um, isn't. 15% fatality rate looking develop encephalitis complication measles, happens 0.1% cases. total case fatality rate measles 0.1%-0.2%, far less severe  Although interesting, really refute point least. mortality risk directly exponentially related age. holds true countries. fact slightly less true developing countries interesting (although I'm really sure surprising), way change fact misleading make statement like ""48% deaths people age 60"" without also mentioning talking 90% population.

It's correct, see number reported way almost universally. I'm saying wrong. wish point people think demographics little bit, could come away grossly overblown sense risk. Don't. like everyone else said, untested. also taking vaccine someone else need it. don't. Official numbers take sweet time updated published internet. 9.56 millions figure 6th April. Damn, 92 still parent alive.... called coercion moron. unlikely anything related vaccine far out. 99% vax side effects immediate nearly immediate. one reason 'long term data' excuse anti-vaxxers illogical. Vaccines cause rando stuff happen 2 weeks later, much less 6 mos.  


If concerned course, call doc report condition worsens guy area WW2 vet, lived 112.

His secret whiskey &amp; coke cigars. Amazing old dude lol that's new microchip. /s Georgia - we've never mask mandate read post chuckle sadly myself. So....after first dose, twice hard get COVID? 

That's means. means, took 100 people exposed covid, 48 people would catch covid.  remaining 52 exposed covid second time, likely catch second time either.

It's basically Russian Roulette, Covid style. can't know hand group catch covid. Also one dose, group still catch covid, fully protected hospitalization death yet. 

Meaning, risk fully protected hospitalization death. happen two weeks second dose. think so. adenovirus vaccines DNA viruses produce mRNA infected cell, produce lot it. hard compare dramatically different types vaccine. love mRNA vaccines; criticism viral proteins included. Google ur friend  Disnt Russia thing Sochi winter Olympics? Sort controversial. even one comment like number white commenters making passive-aggressive racist comments high thread.

Now US/Mexico border agree - fact put comment quotes made think mocking it. Kids likely sex trafficked die car accident even die flu die Covid let's note hype something not. know. article read said ""hold harmless"" allowed many countries. infringement individual rights suppose. went say that's ""loaned"" AZ Canada Mexico. way bypass contractual difficulties.

I doubt way found somehow transfer unneeded US doses countries need them. unneeded doses exist yet. They're pre-purchased. think estimated two months we'll actually possession doses arms for. Depending happens hesitants. Treat completely unvaccinated 2 weeks out

This first dose Pfizer? Trying apparently last post somehow uncivil:

Only 150 kids die year riding bikes, still make kids wear bike helmets know keeps safer. balances desire keep safe need live little.

Parents zero guidance achieving balance COVID. good information tools help. know chance serious long-term side effects are, given recommendations managing exposure, there's vaccine available. 

Just blithely dismissing challenge helpful. can't speak another country might allow, would feel safe that, although would also wear face mask.  Someone’s Desean Jackson fan... like capable typing two words time went ahead super hard work typing third one 20% vaccinated hopefully news headline tomorrow. Hopefully state statistics also updated. mandates reducing rate transmission. rate vaccination high enough keeps rate transmission 1 whole remove restrictions.

The trouble rate transmission depends people's behavior, like mask wearing social distancing. rate transmission dips one current restrictions, response remove restrictions, rate transmission jump 1 again. right approach phased reopening - gradually open up, making sure case rates start creeping up. effective AstraZeneca vaccine compared big players? None cell epitopes variants changed. cells last defense immune system clear infected cells, preventing severe disease. agree fear mongering around variants. done based solely results antibody neutralization tests: variants get around antibody. J&amp;J vaccine 100% protective hospitalization death South Africa, even though vaccine induced antibodies tenfold reduction ability neutralize virus. Antibody immunity whole story, mainstream media focuses on, spurred prominent individuals know better. got Moderna, side effects indeed brutal. However, well worth it- I'll take couple days fever order able see people live life fully again. shows shamelessly hypocritical UK govt is. Thousands dying Europe every day, send 700.000 life saving shots corona free Australia. suits next, call us ""friends partners"" again. 

Take page America's book instead. call neighbours friends, least help out. explanation patients necessary imho. grandma scared hell, whole AstraZeneca ordeal, fear disappeared doc explained everything her. Ok thanks clarification Let's put FAQ, then! got morning surrounded 30 year olds look exactly like me. Everyone getting now. wasn’t expecting eligible like mid-May. Well it’s pretty shady Sputnik claim it’s sabotage Slovak government testing quality vaccine purchased.

Attacking customers doesn’t reek trust confidence. lot parse headline. 'Less effective' mean 'ineffective'.

The world really needs vaccines capable effective. going need multinational effort vaccinate world throwing shade every vaccine candidate probably helping. Every single day? Why? right, 30s risk ICU AZ vaccine higher risk ICU COVID. It’s mental, take vaccine case (maybe protect vulnerable people, cost?)?

I COVID Christmas, I’m assuming level immunity already, I’m going accept risk taking AZ vaccine. take RNA vaccine though. great.

I found appointment using vaccinespotter.org, made another Redditor.

It's fairly easy find appointment near you, even shows manufacturer is. orders magnitude likely die accident way clinic die blood clot shot. fine. fatal? questions:     

1. contracted covid-19 virus wait number months getting vaccine?      

2. possible virus created lab?    

3. anything wish general public I
knew viruses keeps getting reported / propagated incorrectly?    

4. good resource learn viruses? 

Thanks ! must like Super Bowl, Olympics, Spelling Bee Championship, Landing Moon one ... thanks work I’m sure thankless! Wait? What? are? happen?  that's efficacy means.

at 52% efficacy 52% less likely unvaccinated person catch covid. 95%, 95% less likely - percentage applied explained around 2:20 mark. 👏that's👏not👏what👏vaccine👏effectiveness👏measures👏. Vaccine efficacy/effectiveness (VE) measured calculating risk disease among vaccinated unvaccinated persons determining percentage reduction risk disease among vaccinated persons relative unvaccinated persons. greater percentage reduction illness vaccinated group, greater vaccine efficacy/effectiveness.

If risk getting COVID 1% going daily activities, people received vaccine risk reduction 50%. laughing I'm ruling out. can't 100% certain cause either. data needed. see light end tunnel I’m 

motorinnnnn. What’s price flight anyone 30 taken AstraZeneca vaccine?

My first shot tomorrow I'm kinda nervous blood clot reports. 

Also, effective vaccines? Ok thank think I’m paranoid. headache really much else. I’ll monitor tomorrow feel bette I’ll get checked. Thanks Mertens strange guy. Even though RKI (the German insitute approves certifies vaccines) recommends second doses mRNA vaccines 6 weeks vector based vaccines 12 weeks (instead 3 6) due even first dose protection severe ilness death good, chided German MP double degree medicine epidemiology even suggesting postpone second doses everyone gets first shot.

Hey, got two drowning persons two lifebuoys, throw person make sure person survives, right? Anyone info whether take another Covid vaccine getting full dose? Reason asking sinovac available now. Thinking getting getting Moderna becomes available six months now. That's quote article. They're right, need that. right, that. Didn’t 31 year old male used bring groceries mail, unpack, wash hands. still although agree little indication SARS-CoV-2 spread contaminated surfaces. However good idea good hand hygiene reduce transmission infectious agents. would hedge bit less broadly “the fourth quarter earliest”, “the fall earliest”, making statement.

Since summer runs mid/late September, it’s pretty broad timeframe week shy half “second half year”.

Indeed, wouldn’t need shave much earliest expectation offer (October) hit summer – anywhere 9 39 days, abouts, would put “summer” (although barely). Curious Pfizer mentioned. Moderna/J&amp;J approved Aus? daft. doesn’t say didn’t Nice, easily understood explanation. Thanks! vaccine know serious unanswered questions AZ

One hypotheses eventually COVID-19 become common cold, like 4 common cold CoVs. entered humans animals many years ago likely caused large outbreaks noticed many reasons. think part reason SARS-CoV-2 virulent zero population immunity begin. nearly everyone infected disease pattern change. much time takes anyone's guess, probably lifetime. said SA would much worse UK variant, looks like not. 

Don't think possible might true Indian variant? think people need chill bold declarations truly know anything. UK variant clearly transmissible any, responds well vaccines. 

P1 seems like concerning bunch, said SA variant too. So...we shall see doctors probably working Germany. 3 sessions? That’s way little! Masking public still science, social science.

No one complies regulation there's large fraction people special exemption. say ""mask indoors except vaccinated"" quarter people vaccinated, net result one wears mask indoors anymore. ELI5 please Thank TWiV. It’s essential staying informed nursing school beginning career. Keep Racan-yelling! really know what's wrong people like Mertens. county 1.1 million people we're vaccinating 80,000 people day. personally inclined mask shown benefit self society. Thank you! People simply ignore that. I'm fan Islam(or religions matter) Indian media showed Jamat going Muslims criminals spreading Corona, Kumbh best thing ever think we're already seeing shift. posts comments lately skeptics/deniers/whatever want call them, think happening kind person increasingly getting vaccinated disengaging topic.

I would suggest set goalpost shutting sub cases drop certain point. serve purpose giving platform unscientific point. Let break you.

Americans (us live within United States Territories), close winning big game bad enemy. But, worst thing could celebrate winning game game actually extend length game even further. talk photo article there’s Moderna leaflet tucked J+J/Janssen box? bad, **my comment applies PFIZER** \- ones people know handling. could (and be, mentioned) different others. Proportion case counts relevent right?

Correct. Maybe assumed incorrectly, thought ""proportion"" referred ""Proportion severe COVID cases young adults.""

So, yes, would concerning Hospitilization:Case rate started growing among 30s 40s, think currently case. least, article telling us.

My take whole thing top level poster. expected result older folks getting vaccinated restrictions dropping behavior changes across country.

For many younger people, always protecting older generations. high proportion vaccinated, equation changed resumed much normal behavior despite vaccinated themselves.

Now, I'm realizing relatively major error post. Case rates perfectly linked hospitalizations start vaccinating older people. case rates held constant last month, unlikely hospitilizations held constant. However, [hospitilization see near differences age ranges death rates do, 4x difference 30-39 year olds 65-74 year olds still going drop rates good amount vaccinate older folks. B.1.1.17 fit ancestral virus, hence displaces many, places introduced. Fitness increased viruses many ways, increases infectivity. opinion proven variant 'contagious' virulent. data simply there. Rather variants fit displace previous variants. right place right time. Ahh makes sense thank you!! need license vaccinations. injectors pharmacists, nurses, ma's pa's. states allow pharmacy techs IM injections like vaccinations (Idaho Washington afaik) tbf though easy injections do

Sources: vaccination cert pharma tech

Edit: almost approved mass vaccine site, estimating average 3 minutes per shot per vaccinator. 2 vaccinators could roughly 200 shots day time frame think seeing data important especially kids live longer us Please point period time pandemic Americans unilaterally supported adhered lockdowns mask mandates. importing countries sign contract vaccine company contains 'hold harmless' clause? far vaccines show least effectiveness variants. moment lot worry about, worth monitoring. China democracy. easier implement rules like ruling party fear getting thrown power. appears reduce long COVID symptoms 30% patients

Can talk likely mechanism behind (not case parosmia, across board)? reservoir virus people long Covid? struggle understand else antibodies vaccine would relieve symptoms post-infection. Dead water? They’re gonna sell billions them. Seems like US surpass UK terms vaccinations, right US 26.5%, UK 28% wait US finished... US perspective - People skeptical whenever government tells pretty much anything.

To fair, though, vaccines developed quickly makes nervous regarding long term effects. get money viewers carrier fees paid cable satellite providers. I've read many times really understand that's possible. planning increasing speed insane amounts? many extra vaccines coming we'll catch up? wedding planned August (60 people) obviously would really like know that's even possibility point. First higher proportion mean higher number cases. case rate constant 30 somethings, it’s proportion increases. expected happen older groups get vaccinated stop contributing hospitalizations/deaths.

If Covid cases constant 30 somethings, one would expect number cases hospitalized also constant group. . hospitalization increasing cases constant variant taking population, means variant higher hospitalization rate age group. Congrats!!!!!!!!!!! Thank much!! reassuring. means get roll again! they're losing fewer deaths less economic damage almost every comparable developed country? wish everyone inept. Herd immunity SARS-CoV-2 requires around 70% population immunity. think approaching 50% many areas (certainly higher Israel) combination vaccination infection (the latter 10 fold underestimated). think decrease cases US recently partly consequence approaching herd immunity.

It’s going difficult go back 5 day week office work. School district work really hard leave though. Lots time (we work summer though), secure retirement program, pretty solid job security.  also happen like boss coworkers. boss supports wfh it’s shut over. 

It’s school district though it’s super inflexible. Previously allowed work home “wasn’t fair” people couldn’t work home NOBODY gets work home. Also get feeling somebody high WFH. 

I’m really considering leaving really secure job planning keeping another 27 years wfh... go Yale, heavily implied we'll requiring covid-19 vaccinations recent communications - they're discussing earlier move-ins non-vaccinated students receive vaccines enough time kick vaccinated students arrive. official announcement I'll surprised end it. Sad expected... dumptruck office would suffered worse fate... still might idiots running around spreading Alex Jones bs I’ve white collar jobs drained soul, blue collar jobs loved, vice versa. oh so? want see too. Like people WFH? think would hells angels get ""34%"" tatoo you’re quoting things you’re contradicting asserting supports argument? I’ll second this. making conscious effort push flexibility work home six months pandemic hit. They’d treat us like fucking children, saying “it’s privilege,” we’re news room, hear phones, etc. literally control. We’re satellite office useful meetings conducted remotely respective teams New York, none us actually worked together anything. weren’t there, would manager wander make sure knew watching me? would send blank meeting invites call us meeting rooms keep us toes? toxic. breakdown got fired end anyway working hard stressing much months rest life disappeared, husband probably felt single, gave shingles 34. thought cruise ports handled federally, state-wide thing effect? Americans monolith. Plenty us begging too.

The idiots louder. would've driven extra 25 minutes Pfizer, that's me. country hoarding; needs start send unused vaccines elsewhere. issue people try research find stuff confuses come conclusion alter DNA. 

Reality feeds instructions cells make spike protein virus show immune system. hijack like virus would, alter DNA way.  clearly US it’s usual selfish self. Yeah - consensus people know seems would prefer primarily work home, would like option go every while. already established company would converting primarily work home want it, tell go twice week, I'd look new job. There's reason need office I'd rather able live somewhere like spend 2 hours commuting day. Right. Someone downvoted reason makes sense. team gets one day office cycle people share offices. Example; gets Monday use office Monday, Production gets Tuesday use offices Tuesday. cut lot space rental costs. know shared offices hybrid schedule something talked husbands company. Which, frankly, kind astounds given much cruise ports like Fort Lauderdale, Tampa Miami pump local economies.

Cruise lines wrangling CDC come safe resumption business plan pretty much (through CLIA individually) look like they'll mandate 100% vaccination requirement crew passengers 18, minors needing negative PCR test within 72 hours sailing.

Way throw monkey wrench that, DeSantis. Greg Abbott TX, particular Galveston cruise port.  ages? Cause ask me; ain’t broke don’t fix it. favorite part, looking back, pandemic first couple months never drove anywhere taking lockdown real serious. like May went drive car first time battery dead driven. long since entry level job? many jobs get daisy chain last jobs connections, many friends even significant others meet career? biggest concern interns entry level junior staff. They'll never make friends network work. They'll take much longer get hang procedures things can't well put face name office function, ask colleague next ""stupid"" questions. They'll never get chummy boss except really confident ones, self select specific, privileged archetypes. It'll much harder get ahead. They'll never invited aid random conferences highest high levels meeting, frills removed invite list, filling room longer goal. meet next boss way, could-be future spouse peers get drinks later.

Nevermind older folks like nice slow office pad social lives, need distraction home, anything like that.


The problem wfh empty desks ruin office culture everyone. Yes workaholics like commuters like people haters like it. average joe gets kinda shafted. add people. people live tiny apartments work, otherwise could live anywhere.  come sub. lol doesn’t happen Germany. Don’t get hopes up. time balance shifts top reaps rewards. Vaccine supply back March levels? happened increase supply April :(

Also, what's going J&amp;J? long take make batch? Congrats, friendo. We’re getting old af. anyone experience going neighboring county 'available adults phase' get vaccine CVS? Like county yet phase CVS care drive hour another county state? Eh, pfizer shot Denver hospital took time take elevator 2nd floor took shot. absent requested 10 minutes spent observation waiting room post-shot would 5-6 minutes. 

This take long moderately well run vaccine site. purpose positivity statistic find enough testing done

 


A high percentage positive results suggests cases remain undiagnosed additional tests conducted find isolate infected individuals spread disease further

 
A low percentage sign enough tests administered ensure infections detected contained, interrupting chain transmission. 


If people statstically unlikely positive take test skews relevance positivity rate expect EU threats seize intellectual property? much social distancing rules kept up? New World syndrome. People indigenous North American, South American, Oceanian ancestry generally crappier immune systems Afro-Eurasians. Afro-Eurasians lived thousands years densely populated areas high levels contact tribes intense animal agriculture. Hi, I'm allergist/immunologist.

The CDC initially reservations patients prior anaphylaxis reason, there's model would support fear. AAAAI released statement saying prior history allergy propylene glycol really reason avoid Pfizer vaccine. said, states still flag online screening ever anaphylaxed reason. discovered lab studies unclear kind effect would real life. It’s clear variants evade cell response, protects severe disease. top Pfizer released data smaller study South Africa encouraging reduced efficacy there. also clear Israel Pfizer stands B117 without additional problems. make immune covid ever be. Time go back normal vaccinated. Wearing mask afterwards pointless. It’s like putting plastic wrap around vault door laser defense system. You’re accomplishing much. No, -ish please Bold assume people actually quarantining it’s security theater. It’s actually making anyone safer. leaders shown utter incompetence abuse power. refuse let anyone else tell “finish line” is. got vaccine, finish line.  vaccination centers capacity 500K per day, they're still working reduced capacity due vaccine shortages. week around 940K vaccines given 35K (out 50K) general practitioners, max. 20-40 doses per doctors/house. given 100 doses per week, Germany easily manage 5-6 million jabs per week. Unfortunately we've wait May current supply allow it. That’s shitty excuse. country exporting vaccines injecting population. India deserves every bit criticism here. undermines confidence read headlines. Unless AUS/NZ scientific reason turn AZ vaccine Aside vaccinated recovered probably substantial number people exposed virus either never got sick never got sick enough counted recovered? right almost job openings remote. point go back in-person companies go back office. in-person workers leave move remaining remote companies — old jobs (in person) posted. Thus remote job openings decrease person job openings increase. company sees trend return office job openings person point, stay competitive those. agree. jobs tell pretty quickly someone pulling weight. say always valid reason, long workload reasonable, try get addressed let person go.

 option always jobs work remotely, IMHO. I've engineering nearly 25 years. 90% work done remotely, I've bosses tolerant others work remotely, reason come office days, yet always requisite. waste couple hours card every day commute park ass cubicle day thing could back home. Also people sick eligible vaccination either 10% general population eligible vaccinated repeat That’s everything except vaccinating people pointless. Masks, restrictions, lockdowns nothing country isn’t giving people shots campus open, teleworking not. going fairly well given circumstances. slow process. really, really hard predict. Judging recent news reports Israel may reached herd immunity mid-50% vaccinated (alongside natural immunity) magic number, seems UK almost US weeks away. didn’t say live. Immunosuppressants affect efficacy vaccine, safety. point friend reliable anecdotal source paint patients. 0.0004% risk blood clot (not even risk death)? What’s reasoning wanting know? donate blood Red Cross test free always ridiculous claim. Problem supply.  They're making nurses sign waivers lie corona virus deaths Japan. choice sign resign. know someone personally know. anyone else back up?

Do information this, /u/momomonoki ? liberals NDP continue eat others vote. cons need 35 percent win all. Yeah, saw :( far interesting happening news became news... read, said requires students live campus, go school. Part “not ready move on” attitude comes working kids, specifically older kids. Right kids aren’t vaccinated, can’t move quite yet.

The part “not ready move on” attitude comes wife working hospital, gotten moderate-severe case COVID, experiencing ongoing post-COVID syndrome symptoms, dealing effects PTSD relative saw past year. Quite frankly whole “let’s move on” attitude, whether people realize it, devalues experiences many people (maybe permanently) deal negative health outcomes gotten COVID and/or trauma seen much death suffering relatively confined hospitals nursing homes.

So yeah, consider part vaccinated “not ready move on” crew. that's true *absurd* well Japan doing. Japan apparently next nothing, handling virus much better even successful countries Europe. I'm curious play fact they're still going requiring masks major deal breaker NZ doesn’t constitution.

And give shit citizens outside country. makes easy vote elections, routinely advocates treatment, usually discrimination Australia.

This called breaking point collapse... people longer treated needed. Yep, sounds good theory practice belies misunderstanding human nature. Cases dropping fast young people still vaccinating care homes. There's definite vaccine effect relatively recent. Sounds like anxiety thing honest. Czech Republic tested everyone? still think really ethical pause vaccine side effects rare, since indirectly causing deaths. Limiting 60s also seems strange since 50-60s also high risk dying covid. see anecdotal information. always remain skeptical kinds claims without hard data. studies UK health care workers, previously infected individuals protection similar 90% efficacy vaccine (e.g. J&amp;J single dose).

Other studies shown previously infected individuals got one mRNA vaccines substantial boost antibody activity. still beneficial vaccinate previously infected individuals, butler one short age lower priority. bout y’all make produce vaccine New Zealand? opinion sputnik V? yall need stop exporting vaccines, use population first.

People act like COVID incredibly dangerous ages. No, minuscule risk compared activities do, age group. Yet still take seriously \*care\* people significant risk. expect people \*care\* us well. **New Cases 7-day per 100,000**
US 190
Canada 175

 **Tests per 7-day. Per 1000**

So raw human impact Canada still edge, however look forward well. Canada still actively new wave surge cases increasing significantly week record number new cases broken, US numbers seem relatively static increasing slowly

Canada (or least BC) variant cases could see UK variant powered surge day pushing daily CA see es US.

Perhaps there’s people think “shutdown” crowd cult? We’re year-plus think people tired restrictions, hence shift opinion sub. shift also reflected real world, hey, guess we’re cultists you’re enlightened one! want wait get vaccine available entire family unit. Currently, vaccinating people age categories get vaccinated think fair kids/younger adults house protection. I'd rather take whole household get vaccine available everyone. 

Is allowed? They’re less 1/30 size US terms population. It’s like US around 10k cases day. Bali buy negative tests street $50usd rate EU, (eu members) probably reach end year 2022 :/ Except using information draw money without permission check fraud. Situations change, may strong assuming kiwis NZ returned earlier. 

I’m ok temporary measure. 

I’m actually pretty annoyed though MIQ staff vaccinated cases outside quarantine result.

Personally want go back home US end year, pace NZ vaccination slow, feel kiwis slow get vaccinated unless offered incentives.

All means doubt 50% vaccinated end year, border restrictions lingering on. Pfizer announced results study 12-16 year olds good terms safety protection. However, still present results FDA approval. likely approved soon, still last step. ongoing trials children 12, know results finalized.

It's whataboutism. acknowledgement although criticism Israel warranted, something fundamentally different bringing criticism **every** context Israel mentioned. Criticizing Israel antisemetic. Acknowledging suffering Palestinians antisemetic. Selectively targeting Israel matter context antisemetic, however.

Shit's gettin' real! Yep declared reached herd immunity vaccinating 56% population, even started kids yet.

They say 15% population recovered, 56% + 15% = 71% considered well threshold herd immunity.

In US 7% population recovered. population people exposed either get sick get sick enough recorded, Gottlieb estimated 30% back January 40% February.

I think US reaches 50% vaccinated numbers drop precipitously it'll beginning end. Thomas Mertens (head standing commission vaccination, STIKO) actually claimed last year would challenge Germany administer 100k doses Coronaimpfung könnte bis 2022 \[..\] Wenn man etwa pro Tag 100.000 Menschen impfen würde, brauche man 150 Tage, um 15 Millionen Menschen zu impfen. Dieses Tempo wäre nach Mertens Ansicht bereits eine Herausforderung.

DeepL corona vaccination could take 2022 \[...\] vaccinated 100,000 people per day, example, would take 150 days vaccinate 15 million people. pace would already challenge, according Merten. Michigan entered chat... Palestine. Honestly next 3-4 months went places required vaccine passport would dude literally said made $40K past two years 28 years old, he’s lying. Blasphemy! priority preventing hospitalizations death. High school students either. spent past year saying masks protect everyone. change? ""no skin game"" commenting person risk one way other. want someone explain vaccinating healthy high school students many unvaccinated makes sense. that's bad place 3 star hotel. We’re learn hard lesson strain mutation. wish ignored... actually preaches them, sadly Could please DM link newsletter? I'm interested follow. J&amp;J shot passed 5 mins went ER. 2 days ago. I’m fine :) gonna happen. Businesses give office space, it. think getting german mentality this, he's probably happy positive outcome. Many fellow germans know tend see things pessimestic literally cannot fail - exact opposite americans I've worked far. 
I also think rather overdeliver getting grilled ""another setback regarding vaccination numbers"" public media AZ frequent shifts pandemic stategy, annoy many right now. think luck previous variants current variants transmissible aerosols. US us \~30% natural immunity vs. 12% Israel. Despite hunger games style approach vaccine rollout, Illinois ought 50% first dose two weeks solid third state already COVID. know lift restrictions summer, pandemic effectively going early May. Weren’t news refusing pay bill vaccines? much old news. known since weeks J&amp;J deliver EU mid-April initially limited doses, pick speed May. Reddit comment filter vaxxers vs non read want (also maybe auto downvote based lean) 600 people appointments turned away ""Vaccines All"" event Dick's Sporting Goods Park Wednesday number people adverse reaction Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, according statement Centura Health.

The vaccination clinic — sponsored Centura Health state —closed around 3:30 p.m. 1,700 shots administered. Kevin Massey, spokesperson Centura Health, said 11 people adverse reaction on-site observation site, required two patients transported hospital additional observation 

""Following administration J&amp;J vaccine onsite observation, saw limited number adverse reactions vaccine,"" Centura Health officials said statement.

""We followed protocols abundance caution, made decision — partnership state — pause operations remainder day.""


Centura officials specify reactions observed severity. Messages seeking information state immediately returned.

A spokesman Tri-County Health Department, whose jurisdiction Dick's facility falls, said agency also learning problem.

The 640 people scheduled receive vaccine Wednesday automatically rescheduled another mass vaccination event Sunday, they’ll receive rhe Pfizer vaccine, Massey said. pumping ketchup paper takeout bag alongside food gets messy? Differences likely due age vaccine recipients. Also side effect rare people may identify problem. doesnt occur immediately vaccination. no-one quite sure yet even side effect, although becoming likely. Couldn’t disagree this. I’m far productive office interacting colleagues face face inner web. Vietnam see knuckled handled business. It’s going fascinating blooming back everything dust settles. Sound much like Germany even worse. Please check edit part initial post :) AHHHH makes much sense! see, Michigan similar lot midwestern states, single superspreader event would explain sudden spike. Interesting speculation, bet right. would check around, signups seen, question asking dose need. trick would sure giving type vaccine first one, always disclosed. really get move much bed, bathroom, desk, kitchen within meters one another (I rarely even make 2k steps day unless pencil time go run). There's never change scenery. rarely get talk anyone work unless work. real time decompress sort thoughts everyone unloads stress onto everyone else lunch dinner. sound like nut Wrong immune least risk significantly higher second-dose people, would've spottable effect clinical trials, unlike first-dose effect. Thank you! pretty much competely normal three still measures place clubs? Surely contract published repeated claims butchers shops crystal clear follow. 

I won’t hold breath. best friend New Zealand similar view you.

I guess look situation, American Czech Republic. One year ago even thought going US, situation dire seem going away time soon, especially lack vaccination.

So really agree ""you've year"" thing. Obviously things India terrible, otherwise implementing rules. can't Kiwis India reason want go home now, compared point last year? I’d love see real opinions doctor talking about. He’s anti vaxxer questioning need vaccine natural antibodies. question ""what percentage total infections air travelers""

The relevant question ""what percentage infected air travel people coming india"". 

So 1000 incoming people infected 600 india, need start looking measures similar NZ. 

This racist question, directly connected New Zealand story. first dose Walgreens, website let change location second dose scheduled at. option 3 weeks first dose place. Unless someone found workaround. Maybe younger people active? society interacting people via schools job, etc? Older people retired stay away society whole living home. Oh wow, everywhere go, I've proud folks. Logan Square, Wicker Park, Little Italy, Hyde Park... can't say much lakeside loop though. interesting, thanks sharing! Yea I'm sure robust scientific study things settle down...I kind get feeling want anything official yet could scare people one could cause supply issues. We'll point mid-summer masks distancing next useless even group unvaccinated people. That's point trying reach herd immunity. US Europe certainly Germany. prevalence also drops effects.

Fauci seem count recovered population people exposed get sick sick enough counted. looks vaccinations, insists 70-90% population vaccinated. extremely high hurdle especially consider 30% population kids can't vaccinated yet. probably Fauci keeps saying 2022 ""back normal"", based assumptions. Although wouldn’t surprised that’s true, never heard that. know many nurses quitting scared covid also discriminated (people assuming infected), paid enough. way EUA used vaccine exactly process exists for. Full approval takes long time, efficient process vaccine companies took material financial risk loss allowed large scale studies occur accelerated timeline. get saying seems like used many antivaxxers conspiracy theory/excuse get vaccinated. personally applaud requirements people get vaccinated currently hope health religious exemptions construed narrowly. people traveling anyway? weeks ago couple dozen people Oregon Washington quarantine returning West Africa (or was) ebola outbreak. covid bad enough. people traveling?? Upon inspection, was. Oklahoma reported 1716 deaths many days 0 reported deaths. trustworthy Mexico high excess deaths same? now. J&amp;J easier ti distribute requires one shot. honestly superior vaccine job replace Oxford medium term, opinion. fuck America days? 60,000 cases day average still surging. American still throwing stones glass house usual.

Yes I'd careful getting hopes up, found new P1 variant reinfect original covid strain, maybe things keep getting worse. might cookin MI Variant lol  Exactly. hands Federal Government is. allocate vaccine provide support there, it’s largely states get vaccines arms. We've saying something similar Ireland year, government refused put MHQ even border closures place want offend countries EU. Nothing confirmed even EMA officially said link ‘probable’ rather definitive. 

Why anyone saying anything regulators finished investigations? Politics. 

You know else EMA said today? benefits outweigh risks except 30s.

Germany:262 dead
Italy: 627 dead
France: 449 dead 
Spain: 126

UK: 45

Sure, Britain’s one jab, 12 week delayed AZ strategy driven desperation. worked working. 

Only ideologues want make decision vaccine safety pharma company’s production problems Brexit. think pretty clear Israel ""right"". reached herd immunity re-opening society almost completely days, kids even vaccinated yet.

I honestly know Fauci gets numbers, seems pick numbers high end range conservative, keep changing them. seem like data model anything. actual, real world data showing 56% population vaccinated, things go ""back normal"". Opposite case household. spent hours scouting state vaccine site back back appointments wife I, could get done trip. Happy ending though, got J&amp;J shots Monday :) What's math figuring 1 month behind? schedule EU well AFAIK, problem schedule includes doses Q1+Q2 compared Pfizer/Biontech. clear mRNA vaccines work well. J&amp;S ad vectored vaccine also good, others. Probably lipid nanoparticle adjuvant effect, coupled delivery lot mRNA. Yes, think see mRNA vaccine technology tried pathogens, including influenza virus. real game changer. exactly behave.  
Thank decent people. Without commenting whether skepticism warranted, nitpicking terminology: IMO misusing ""anecdotal information"". CDC sharing *anecdotes* here. They're sharing *an interpretation data* claim have.

An anecdote personal story necessarily indicative sort large-scale statistical trends. ""My 95 year old grandma got COVID cold"" anecdote reflect reality huge number people age COVID extremely serious. conversely, ""My 25 year old friend got COVID ICU month!"" anecdote can't tell us anything reality (except *100%* COVID cases young people harmless), indeed reflect reality almost 25 year olds COVID infection *not* particularly serious. ""data across country shows worrying trend""? anecdote. Defeatist frankly supported facts. Wife doses Pfizer. side effects speak of.

My parents 2 Moderna also side effects.

My doctor friends wicked sick like 1-2 days second dose Moderna.

Bottom line, seems everyone vastly different response. Personally, feel 1-2 days feeling flulike really bad even get side-effects. Hospitalizations falling city San Francisco

San Fransisco rolling 7 day average 35 new cases per day right now. That's basically nothing. split 30-50 year olds. What's number? many new admissions even getting per day subset? single digit number? possibly even getting bunch 0s there? Days one 30-50 range gets admitted hospital.

And say world ""hospitalization"" mean ""current hospitalizations,"" right? ""new admissions.""  number dropping case counts fallen map since February highs. Easily infuriating policy I’ve seen throughout pandemic. Government sponsored lies time trying convince skeptics take shot. WTF thinking? half soccer team catch one another outdoor practice. Quite bit spread happening school district (US - Michigan) school sports related.

Oddly enough, transmission within indoor school settings schools kids attend. real. two weeks first shot, immunity. Well mean yeah... vaccinated various things attend college decade ago. Israel paid $50 per dose (double countries paying) third population Canada. UK US manufacturering capabilities. US selling manufactured supply external countries. US top producer Covid-19 vaccine world (at moment). similar what's seen viral respiratory infections, main difference general public unaware potential complications heard context Covid. 

If parent believes isolating children protect risk post-viral syndrome outweighs harms involved, would need adopt behavior possible infections since risk would still present. 

There's also issue many signs damage often misconstrued news reporters lack proper medical context training. Signs myocardial inflammation (normal sick) described developing 'heart condition'. Self-resolving pulmonary inflammation called 'lung scarring' (not entirely inaccurate, ignores occurs common colds well). Headaches categorized 'neurological issues' (which are, note misleading say sufferers allergies present neurological issues vs headache). Yeah, I'm gonna need source one chief. grandma got first jab Sputnik 2 weeks ago. worried her? know EU also get less announced? Children already lost year lives shit.

And many people lost entire lives. hate articles COVID ""good society."" good shut-in lunatics maybe, vast majority people ADE concern SARS-CoV-2. theoretical concern only, based observations made mice infected SARS-CoV-1, fact observed CoV infections animals. ADE happens many non-neutralizing antibodies made infection. case SARS-CoV-2 ADE concern. Studies convalescent plasma borne conclusion. indoors portland biosecurity state operates. creates problems, creates teen medical subject, exacerbates subject’s problems. offers “therapy” response, instead dealing actual cause, restrictions ruined children’s lives.

Edit: **the biosecurity state injures offers false cure** microbiologist buddy says need vaccinate kids ASAP viruses tend mutate towards path least resistance. conventional strain cause major problems kids teens, something like new India variant may evolve something like deadlier form H1N1 swine flu. I've got mobility problems. option unfortunately.  begrudge anybody so, though. I’m going fema site later today! Really doubt majority people casually gets cosmetic surgery lol essential surgery likely choice cannot really say to. mean years? went local mall large majority people wearing masks. one enforcing chaotic. left almost instantly point hope someone proper field experience/training stopping saying, ""IF designed lab, possible every wave variants produce something efficient/deadly?"" remember hearing many things mutations concern unlikely coronaviridae, checks errors code constantly, yet...Here are. really going here? people offer false choice ending mitigation strategies persisting masks distancing hundreds years taken seriously even understand hell saying. 

The people pushing endlessly kids go back school full time parents want state raise kids ability, desire, talent taking care kids full-time. admit risks involved sending kids back (when?) poor little Johnny Janie get sick always cry pretend one could seen coming, thus garnering sympathy still getting state watch kids. 

This pandemic ought make us realize two things, Americans far dumber far selfish even thought. need realize admit weakness enemies attempt exploit, already have. much know potential long term effects viral infections? colleagues due second Oxford Tommorrow alot 30, offered alternative though. Oh, like Genghis Khan wearing Sean John Bhutan! son 15 1/2. WAIT 6 MONTHS FFS. Nothing forced reboot fix. shit personal experience... story *everyone* tells.

We exaggerate stories unintentionally similar ways rush support similar claims man beside us means alleviate subconscious guilt.

In end, advise next generation half ass everyone else does. Again, means alleviate guilt... convince everyone else morally ok, maintain high ground lying cheating.

Hence closer infected person increase chances inhaling droplets. number 15 minutes derives situations transmission observed, think even less time could transmit. mask traps virus-containing droplets. mask fits properly good job 100%, therefore best stay distant people. school going mostly person somewhat online, know people whose departments almost entirely online need give thought It’s inverse. right religious freedom supersede right life. rights end rights begin. threaten right life merely present society one needs removed society. ...she slept bartenders house... dont think safe.

Go it. can't legally prevent citizens returning. Short delays seem legally ok, though still tested court. getting vaccine like upper arm, it’s best stretch minimize soreness. Keeping arm still allows get stiff part reason felt sore children lost year lives this? know long term risks injection?

We'll know lot risks — although *everything*, course — after vaccines actually FDA approved, quite soon. Yeah second one Moderna hit like freight train. rough 12 20ish hours! fever, chills, aches, soreness like done full 2 hour long body workout. vaccine escape, mean zero protection disease? low probability, cell epitopes vary cells prevent disease. Every state country given patient. Vermont hospitalizations up, down. Deaths down.

Variants increase cases deaths coming Vermont’s neighbors pose new risks, Vermont’s location isn’t ideal continued best results status due nearness variant spread. 

Iceland New Zealand always better, Vermont comparatively proud itself. would expect told AZ could send shipment thereby allowing claim home make shipment, government spin pretty common UK politics. fair, lot people study's placebo group reported side effects, too. 44.4% dose #1 38.4% dose #2.

You logically reason everyone getting active vaccine side effects it, either. psychosomatic, unrelated. Allergy season here, I've fighting headaches, congestion cough daily. 

And headache, chills joint pain 12-24 hours still better Covid.

[Moderna Total Systemic Reactions According CureVac, US blocking export raw materials, hindering supply No, think predict mutations enhance fitness. certain experiments cells culture experimental animals, ability extrapolate results humans limited. good news turn around vaccine within 2 months necessary. Bullshit [I think normally modeled K Feel free stop believe saying lack uniformity vaccination efforts causing number people responsible spread (K disbursal) get lower lower. cause cases come surges, especially reopen, even R remains 0.

I'm teacher, passed vaccine hesitancy, swinging toward getting sort details doc regarding codfish allergy I've since young. never reaction vaccine before. 

One thing I've wondering about: people differentiate side effects knowing something really wrong? headaches body aches people mention thread seem go beyond migraine-I used suffer still time time. requested make temporary work home status permanent saves 9 hours week commuting time.

I'm incredibly thankful husband makes enough allow freedom (we'd actually floated June timeline quit stay home wife become stay home mom) feel obligated use privilege speak behalf coworkers financial freedom so. Management walks everybody high time somebody reminded people take long. 70% herd immunity, dunno Good, hope EU whole learned bureaucracy good much kill people. Thank coming! seen videos understanding think variants concern (B.1.1.7 P.1, etc) concerning. concerned countries variants taking off? transmissible they? likely evade vaccine protection? got mine, hallway three stations eight feet apart nurse each. brought three time nurses administering shots handed syringes. injected them, handed patients 15-minute timer instructed everyone go sit classroom hallway timer went off. brought next batch three. five groups three entered waiting three minutes explaining people process, getting nurses’ stations, injecting them, clearing out.

Much social anxiety sucks, ya gotta put learn content little within exclusive reach. That's unfeeling universe. USA ex president : Covid-19 hoax

Some countries reporting zero cases, rule may fly radar. As The Associated Press notes, two countries particular, North Korea Turkmenistan, drawn skepticism international community accuracy health data. Ireland. Eight months covid-19, still perceived negative impacts covid work, social, home life. seem time ability make work family, that's something admired respected. others would lucky, true household income goes down. family poor, per say, mother work full time well off. would able provide type environment kids this. I'm honest, even did, I'm sure ability anyways. able make year's worth in-person schooling social interaction kids. 

So me, sending kids back school easy decision. mother agreed, agree little days.

The fact schools still closed (or recently re-opened) sounds literally devastating me, feel bad kids.

If Sherkey ilk would done fuck ever, might mess. Gaslight, Obfuscate, Project China also really many numbers. wave frightening like everyone else's first wave, tiny comparison going India US months ago. Also, virus bad Wuhan, extreme lockdowns stopped getting bad everywhere else country.

Fox News going anywhere Whats quarantine facility? linked four studies, zero articles. work home, tired talked meetings nonsense rise using zoom accommodate people working home resulted frequent meetings. me, meetings equally waste time least zoom easier squirm way it. Statistically would invalid. Since get time every unique sample gives stronger representation total population vaccines out. articles like one saying problem positivity rates rising. foundation false theyre comparing rate smaller representation populous rate wider testing adoption population occured. 


As reference. Lets say ski company broken leg rate. Initially levels skiers utilized skis broken leg rate 10%. sudden new skis another company started adopted senior skiers new / intermediate skiers used main ski companies skis. broken leg rate goes 20%. point issue current batch skis? doesnt. points population skiers utilize skis less experienced likley inclined accident. 


Thats essentially happening here. Everyone originally tested sense vaccinated no-longer getting tested due cdc fauccis direction to. higher risk population people getting tested. result youre going expect rates go up.  


Add different vaccination population ratios state state rates weighted worst towards states better vaccination rollouts. comparing positivity rates literally mean nothing. 


Its wonderful world weighted statistics. Im sure another data scientist back one. Israel saying they're 71%, vaccinated recovered, *may* herd immunity. That's pretty close Fauci said. really stretches definition allow sub... Nice. People like completely lost. thanks showing live public, dont need bother interacting you. state wasn’t publishing accurate numbers

Ive used pretty good stating info doesn’t know. don’t time limits social ends, we’re almost there. know right? People crazy. may even hit percentage one dose Israel did... likely much higher percentage immunity previous infection. I’m thinking, hoping, sometime within next month cases begin plummet. strange see US seems facing vaccine surplus right , still trying prevent vaccine export.  Well winter may something see anecdotal information. always remain skeptical kinds claims without hard data.

Point being, claim none exists lazy disingenuous argument. world needs sanction Brazil something. Ban Brazil traveling country. Best case scenario, bunch people die probably need to. Worst case scenario, covid 21 started. Bold statement. triggered lot people. I'm obligation prove damn thing you

Then comment rightfully ignored, since substance, value, meaning. behavior exactly I'm talking about.

Asking source is... bad behavior? Seriously? wrong kind think act way. unscientific garbage mentality possible. 

Though guess see like it. wish could make stuff pretend true, get upset others believe me. 

Sad shameful. Could mandate people wear masks know sick?

I think carrot would better stick here. Get stigma ""crap, I'm sick"" feel like 90% problem solves itself. People feel like put brave face shameful stay home symptomatic.

And people *definitely* feel pressured come work sick. U.S. problem generally (not entirely) solved white-collar world, normalization remote work 2020 made even better. working-class world different story, need national universal sick leave. also needs levels employment, something like ""25+ hours week"" get employers structuring jobs 24 hours week dodge mandate.

When comes ""could sick person transmit virus?"", ventilation duration exposure still matter much (if than) proximity. enable sick people stay home, eliminating enduring exposure settings like jobs public transit gets there, left lot fewer cases masks could even make difference first place.

From there, means normalize someone lives alone sick needs go get chicken noodle soup feels comfortable wearing mask (which hopefully use properly, leave even sneezing/coughing, etc).

But feel imperative things reverse order, otherwise wind employers barking sick part-time workers put mask suck come work. Yes, figures pretty close 1 6. posted comment hour ago 45 points. SURE LOT DOWNVOTES!! Gross I'm waiting letter internally large promotion, pay way industry.

It's remarkably dumb. gets trash talked . Yup. anyone concerned letting virus wash country getting kids infected nasty virus don’t know long term effects of, we’re suddenly moving goalposts. much ask continue wear mask spit others mouths kids get vaccinated?

Cheers good luck everyone. You’re better think are! told turn hours. 100% commission. left.  zero evidence variants facing. data suggesting safe spread vaccinated individuals. keep wearing masks social distancing outbreaks minimal. epidemiologists agree expect gain control spread around 2024. no, vaccinated protect you, others you. here, crying nursing world. would desperately love work home, life choices take us. Serfs Hello, 2% lol. certainly want everybody else - want coworkers options!!

My reason: I'll get work-work done whether I'm home I'm office, tend towards general laziness despite commute eating amount time (which bad many others home rn, 25-35 minutes way) I, somehow manage even less evenings leave apartment. Also I'm pretty extroverted I'm lethargic dull own. 

Maybe dedicated office space house room stretch I'd feel differently WFH fun anticipated haha. way example, know SAHPRA inevitably perform additional testing confirm compatibility (or least ensure lack contra-indications) product application relates existing anti-retroviral medication commonly prescribed HIV+ South Africans. is, course, unique South Africa more-or-less required virtue substantial percentage HIV+ citizens.  


On basis, SAHPRA also unlikely approve pharmaceutical product submitted registration shown either interfere efficacy commonly-prescribed anti-retroviral treatment or, material way, reduce immunity HIV+ subjects extent may rendered subject eventual AIDS-related illnesses. naturally certain exceptions, cases registration approval likely made subject stringent conditions.  inquired Palestinians article talking Israel’s vaccination progress explained Palestinians would included obvious propaganda piece... people aren’t rush get line current rhetoric “get vaccine go back lockdown life like good little Boy Scout”.

Exhibit A: California intends reopen June 15th. still masks.

Exhibit B: Vermont, July 4th, masks. Obviously dumbass, I'm saying outsourcing vast majority workforce going catastrophic believe not, person bachelor's degree American accredited university going better outsourced employee 8/10 times. 

Also, companies always outsourcing ""the cheapest option"". outsourcing enough computer science majors/programmers fill increasing demand. comp sci major programmer struggling find work, shit job interviewers see that. Incredibly late, marching hours. Stuttgart nothing happened latest biggest ""demonstration"". Yeah like you’re welder Honestly, opposite experience.

My company paid coffee, snacks, full lunch, beer, transit passes.

Pandemic starts lose equip home office.

I realize typical company buty
In-office benefits worth thousands. goodly number surveyed employees life plan. Good them. Sadly article explain adverse reactions. It’s certainly HIT like clotting issue AZ seeing. takes 2 14 days show up.  imagine pandemic started 2017 2018? I've saved much time money commuting/buying lunch everyday. debt last year (10k+). I'm glad say debt free much better money..
I can't imagine going back office life, everything work done home last year. Even trainings. I'm maybe go month see faces though. good news. I'm surprised see Michigan skyrocketing Illinois, Indiana, Ohio inching up. beautiful Chicago, everyone outside socializing, say everyone seems wearing masks. love Michigan, gorgeous hope stay safe spike. mean, people don’t really call Spanish flu anymore, especially since know likely came Kansas. Typically referred 1918 flu. 

Also, naming conventions changed since then. Yes, it’s great variants play big role public health discussions moment, don’t easy naming techniques like diseases. bc it’s hard remember alpha numeric technical terms, seem defaulted outdated habits. dead-on teams working better everyone remote everyone person. working home (in software) six months pre-pandemic hated it... felt disconnected, participate well meetings, missed important communication happened ad-hoc person, etc.

Now everyone else stopped going office great. Meetings teams, equal footing. Drop-in chats replaced quick video calls/screen sharing. social stuff online everyone starved it.

I want go back office, sure hope stay well connected one dude stabbed Bolsonaro campaign. something.  That's dependant government hand outs. Keep stimulus checks coming work anymore. reddit kept insisting wfh benefit employer going save bit electricity bill. Yeah fully understand. Everyone different situation. That's meant really. people working home time takes toll them, vice versa. hope things good now! kind exemption required vaccine exist medical one. fact states religious exemptions thing. would realize anyway whether choose work home not. it’s either actually outsourcable, boss idiot. cover every state, what's point? Yeah stuff designed keep 12 hours day. Remember anti-vax people using Israel example vaccines cracked (back cases started dropping)? wonder still talk Israel anymore. person allergy Ciprofloxacin take vaccine ? unable find resources last head hunter sent email amazing opportunity - asked WFH. Said company WFH option like tied paid time something. asked they'd paying commute. Crickets. said company wanted pay commute (as work hours, shitty mileage bullshit) might entertain interview. I'm going add 10 hours (minimum) work week (that's like 45+ hours anyway forced hour lunch) burning gas sitting traffic.

If pandemic shook awake anything, getting paid time acceptable - I'm lot pissed took pandemic realize ""good paying job"" paying less 10/hr actually looked hours day/week give 'work'. 

No thanks. Want office? Commute counts work hours. Otherwise, I'll WFH. US workforce could lot competitive outsourcing now, lot barriers US

It’s really experience, it’s cost. Lots people like meme paying Indian software developers $20,000 year plus benefits job someone California $150,000 + benefits, bonuses, etc.. doesn’t even India: plenty qualified professionals Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, etc.. won’t happen overnight, happen. that, people going accept paid less WFH long run; less bonuses, less promotions, etc.. company spent 10 million dollars building renovation 2019. seems itching get people back office feel justified spending money unnecessary renovation (which, way, removed private offices replace open environment - ugh).  Depends country, state, county. can't answer without knowing are. Unpopular opinion: People want socialize work starved meaningful relationships work many hours humans designed function suffering mental health. 

IF worked say, 20 hour work week home offices, plenty time socialize meaningfully, think one would complain missing watercooler chat. gotta go... PEG reactions strong. dependent patient PEG allergies usually weak?  Major props due Native American nations helping accelerate vaccine rollout here. mega vaccine days really helped. One clinic Norman believe 10k shots day. feel morale lifting around state. see people you’d think would anti-vax getting shot willingly encouraging others. rare instance, I’m proud Oklahoman yeah area relatively wealthy (like average 60k year) small company, working productively home 13 months now, today released return-to-office plan set begin April 15th (when employees won’t yet fully vaccinated). 

I got email immediately logged LinkedIn set job notification declare open work. miss colleagues fun shit could do. Go restaurant lunch, going server rooms check stuff place new stuff running downstairs callcenter someone difficult call. miss people freedom. miss choosing work late traffic bad. miss choosing work late time gym. miss dancing. 

Keep generalizing, seems people online prefer so. flu zika vaccines approved countries? quit rather return office. waste time resources. Oh yea nothing fact mostly cows trees. Interesting, wonder people sourcing info from? sense blame corporate media institutions lack trust mainstream news. think people trust seeing hearing due lies propaganda constantly bombarded with. Biden pull Australia stop international travel reach herd immunity, gradually form travel bubbles countries reach point. believe lot counties look US FDA guidance approving researching variety drugs including vaccines. good reputation especially terms confirming safety children pregnant women. Tell it! We’ve back office full time month half now. miss working home enjoyed extra time! miss getting random hugs son working too. Radiohead lyric? think source posted accurate. one, gives 4 models, one. another, date. source nearly year old, early days COVID, ""The paper available preprint yet peer reviewed."" might much natural immunity Israel. cases per capita ever slightly higher theirs. clue Israel testing, know US significantly average tests per capita, meaning case number may slightly inflated relative countries' ""official"" counts, could make difference even smaller. Covid here, left office life 8 years great company December 2020 WFH life. fathom early morning grind get park-n-ride, sit 40min bus ride. commute home taking 2 hrs longer expected game stadiums grinding traffic hault traffic accident. 

No more! Life much better now! [Here numbers Johns Misophonia joke, Jim! Millions suffer every year! Let see scientific results first I’m guessing experience. bank’s quite time now, fact I’ve even used pandemic. money showed account within 24 hours, though admittedly small sum(£30 iirc). 

With cursory google search found forum post [March 2019 showing main UK banks since least then, decidedly pre-COVID. I’m assuming they’re noticing they’ve forced use it, account smaller bank building society hadn’t priorly offered service. took advantage situation moved state middle quarantine, blessing.

Well us single people punished folks decided use condom. training new staff gone without office?  point, none even considering, lax attitude real chance causing surge could lead lockdowns. Now, stay house month get locked thanks arrogant armchair scientists yourself, get actually anything month, right?

You'd get play pretend like virus gone us can't take chance get fucked, again. Cause selfish little bitches take wait. Last year everyone coming together make sure could get back normal vaccines y'all acting bad deniers. fucking worse there's arrogance behind it. vaccine news good lately mean we're fucking clear.

Shitting people valid concerns pretty fucked. hope naive ass gets slammed reality someday damn, lack empathy pretty pathetic. Woohoo!  Include list. Fuck going office life.

What’s funny pre-Covid would he’ll let WFH. Well lookie now. working perfect heart can't really classify ""falling cracks"" pushing cracks. got 2nd shot day started period experienced nothing ordinary compared anecdotes others you’ve also taken Moderna. fever, chills, fatigue maybe 8 hours coming it.

I side effects first apart pain arm feeling extra sleepy. also period first shot. 

FWIW, I’m 40, age range you. fucking true. shithead manager previous job (who reason liked me) try take wing people working me. He'd promoted twice way competent peers stuck.

What learn? guy kept track status department projects, boss asked quick answer (and often took credit). He'd also tell whatever thought wanted hear. subordinate he'd lie you. Anybody real numbers this? I'm highly curious. People resistant forced change ignore fact followed similar rules entire lives. folks get angry spout vaccine ID authoritarian et cetera required carry driver's license drive car, passport order travel internationally, social security number get job, must vaccinated attend public schools, must bank account get credit/debit card, must good credit score get loan... totally arguing want vaccine passports totally get bureaucracy annoying silly people exaggerating tyranny persecution like jews WW2 it.

And actually made sense. building. servers building going relocated. years ago first offered ability home half staff took offer. literally 3 people sitting area perhaps 20 floor designed hold 150 more. 

The company work also shutting offices well. think pandemic simply hastened decision office. Yep. People definitely expose loopholes. feel like Blue Jackets fans pretty good following guidelines. also noticed concessions selling peanuts - probably prevent something like sunflower seed problem.  Agreed. think case started project Covid decent lease. interest going back, sure people go it. 

I go couple days week, I’m Atlanta. That’s enough me. seriously need start this. I've undercutting due lack confidence job title intimidation. 

Seriously can't tell many times I've read complicated job descriptions find real job stupidly simplistic. also opened vaccines people 18+ hotspot regions, clamoring long. also includes mobile vaccination units go large manufacturers, factories, etc. Expected 40% Ontario vaccinated end 4 weeks. 

The rollout opening February extremely disappointing anger towards Ford government time high. I've never really experienced this. middle managers I've worked basically run company backs.

It's executives actual work ""make decisions"" pretty much useless. 

They exactly going fire though. They'll keep reprioritizing everything quarter ruining obsoleting months work. least admit it. automatically makes much moron everyone works home, would employer hire could hire someone India fraction cost? Hmm thought pfizer results came something else? meant total shots reported yesterday (first second doses combined). Thanks summary! Brazil, vaccine recognized brand name instead maker (it's also known many people ""the Butantan vaccine"", local manufacturer vaccine, Butantan Institute, also developing COVID-19 jab, branded ""Butanvac"", yet enter human trials)  That’s....not terrible idea.

They never hire open positions, industry rapidly moving WFH pandemic. Now, even option people consider going office. expecting lot rural areas wouldn’t get vaccine, pretty surprised uptake slow deep blue Dallas still looking like spike protein bullseye. mRNA vaccines targeted that, interfaces humans. seems variants modified protein enough avoid vaccine induced antibodies also modified extent they're less capable interfacing humans, therefore making bit non issue. raised hourly rate 6 dollars last year switching jobs twice. Seems low  unclear? Every 20 year old vaccinate today 80 year old didn’t get vaccinate today. 80 year olds die frequently COVID. 20 year olds almost never COVID. aggregate across entire population adds hundreds people per day. roughly need vaccinate 1000 20 year olds death reduction vaccinating 1 80 year old. might say, 20 year olds lot lose long life ahead him. 

Ok, we’re optimizing death hospitalization reduction, maybe optimize life years saved. this, we’d want first vaccinate boomers. They’re old enough likely die, young enough good 20 years lose.

It’s insane. Pure chaos. B.1.1.7 variant dominant Israel Pfizer vaccine highly effective there, 95%. still find incredibly frustrating us country bar Germany already first dose AZ vaccine who’s peers banned/‘recommended’ forced corner second dose one really knows second dose cause issues.

Actually imagine that’s case therefore risk doubled, would utter shitshow! honest track record AZ, see case. unfortunately hard pass rule 100% second dose issues get another safer vaccine Depends accurate test is. could catch test get plane. 

Do test airport? saw hotel quarantine vlog NZ maybe week ago, guess problem Extremely effective. Good news, worst case work...at least tapeworm.  already are. 3000 day peak going keep dropping here. link shows number tests completed per day SA? Good. pay Okay? say something contradicts that? Pure water. headlines seeing?
I watched press conference live definitely recommendation given Around 2 weeks, believe. B.1.1.7 variant, dominant version virus U.S.; effective Moderna/Pfizer/J&amp;J vaccines variant? stand corrected edited answer, looks like immunity reached. Well minor Middle East studies, live Israel, Palestine many times, work Palestinians weekly basis, yeah know right? post videos best way show people live sweden normality swedes enjoy. find really shocking blatantly trying portray swedes following mask recommendations true.

I go almost everyday, use public transport. like pandemic never existed sweden. Sure people wear mask immense majority see using public transport shopping malls care all. 

Tell country that. mean posting narrative opposite what's happening?. never seen behavior. literally defined every team leader last job Telling   able produce enough deliver according contract signed, exporting, especially countries getting dose per capita  seems unreasonable.

I believe 1. EU chose encourage companies produce world promise free market principles benefited this. 2. foreseen situations like (exports happening time EU shortage) inevitability position 1 taken.

Many countries around world would domestic production either running development EU started principle EU production EU nationals first. Canada, Australia, Singapore many rich countries would forced set supply absence trusted trading partner. 

The moment EU chose put stall place global vaccine production caused inevitable consequence. Unless EU government could ensure large first orders every viable vaccine might end produced within bloc ran risk exports happening time shortage. became apparent AZ many ways would emerged. Delays Pfizer, Moderna first viable vaccine, Novovax one worked etc. Every situation like would caused problem. essence strategy poor. NZ written constitution tradition Parliament's supremacy courts, doubt court challenge could change decision. 

It's 3 weeks anyway current system already resulted people waiting months get spot quarantine system, much different actual practice. 

Also prevent returning home, prevents returning directly India. could fly intermediary country, spend two weeks there, fly home NZ. Ugh. looking forward 2026 airborne Ebola pandemic..... checked ourworldindata, 56% fully vaccinated fraction, 61% received least one shot. cool dishing MK-ULTRA though. includes deaths Easter period. real count 954 - \~360. Still huge. EU blocked one export. rest granted. EU blocking AZ export factually wrong. It’s strange seeing open borders fault people suddenly demand sensible border control policies. right Moderna.

Transmission dynamics fit well social world compromise.

Doing LITTLE BIT less leads opposite outcomes. example, inconveniencing small minority border quarantines prevents cases. amplified conditions country, changes everything. R&lt;1 country - e.g. mandatory rapid testing vaccination - easily afford open borders, influence imported cases minimal (as long invalidate R&lt;1 vaccine escape test failure).

Even worse, hard see sensitivities struggle ""conflicting"" interests swings pendulum frequently. reason says 6 months, latest data have. could 30 years would need wait 30 years find out. 

It's really least 6 months likely much longer. Thanks. found info it: 169 1st dose, 53 2nd dose. Positivity rates dumbest numbers use prove anything. People vaccinated told get tested unless they're showing symptoms. States testing lowest rates total population currently.

Pre vaccine getting tested weekly. Since vaccine tested once.

Positivity rates depends non consistent denominator shifted many things. hold weight list tell me, wrong population-weighted density 
 
The problem support claim, yours. 
Sweden subpar, way weigh it. mum turned 50 AZ vaccine yesterday Spain Preventing covid become endemic would require us work together once... so, no. That’s poor wording newspaper. It’s definitely “at least.” also covid test flight bit scary. vaccine? There's bunch. 

And no, effective. provide protection far 90% effective rate original covid-19. 

Moderna already com forward admitted vaccine protect variant working develop booster.

""Extremely rare"" blood clots would make think maybe handful people would get real-world. administered millions people numbers well past handful blood clots. 

The vaccines this. would healthy 20 year old want get one, especially there's options available? one reasons left last job. boss wanted us back office, one person still WFH full-time. last fall. mind-boggling many people willing office, sitting near (like 6 feet distance 8 hours day 5 days week anything, give break) without masks. told couldn’t wait get back in, told looking forward that. regulations office loosey-goosey me, friends co-workers knew much (or little, some) careful socially. rumors started fly us office “out sight, mind” aka would passed career advancement. Meanwhile I’m WFH busting butt working constantly, call time. thanks. So, found another job.

Oh, icing cake went clean old desk, since March 2020? boss stands within 6 feet me, blabbing away someone else mask on. fall, peak cases rising area. couldn’t get away cleaning desk. That’s sure made right decision.

Vaccines different drugs see marketed TV though, planning distribute en masse otherwise healthy individuals. 0.1% chance serious adverse reaction drug treats serious illness might often acceptable; vaccine that's disaster.

Maybe people start moving, companies actually start paying stay. know, supply demand. former manager exactly person. always completely worthless, got sent home Covid department financials got better definitely realized worthlessness would become apparent. started forcing us tons pointless “development” meetings started micromanaging us Zoom.

I quite 4 months Covid got new job. new boss great actually helpful. I’ve literally learned month last boss year. We're still seeing almost thousand deaths day.  Early reports UK suggested might contagious deadly. cited numbers widely cited, yet methods obtaining numbers correct. someone right experiment change mind. example, show people infected B.1.1.17 shed virus -infectious virus, PCR material - would important. done. recent claim NBA players shed virus longer variant interesting limited study. could important. willing change view given correct data. far correct. know causes reaction vaccine usually rare side effects drugs happen something person predisposes side effect. certain genes factors (and none people original clinical trials). Say risk 1/200000, like dice throw time person gets vaccine. really got first Astrazeneca injection without blood clots, unlikely something changed 3 months. first injection happened without incident good evidence reaction extremely unlikely second time. Meanwhile know effect getting required second injection different vaccine instead. tested. obviously I'm going say impossible someone might suffer reaction second time since know cause, far worried catching coronavirus potential bad side effect instead. Exactly. People make seem like vaccine way get immunity. getting Covid doesn’t guarantee you’ll immune, getting vaccine doesn’t either. It’s actually group people applies to, older people compromised immune systems. make less robust immune response sometimes fail actually clear virus altogether. 

Young healthy folks form protection I’ve read research reinfections it’s comparable getting vaccine. son got JJ yesterday rough go today. Hope feel better soon. fault, thought .01% 2M children gotten disease. Wrong calculation.  I’d assume family members children would die pretty soon going able vaccinated argument slowly becoming far less effective. wonder caused EU wanting companies retain liability. article US can’t send surplus doses abroad contract states used US. clause seems law shields companies liability public health emergencies, send doses abroad, coverage countries. whole process cover companies sent doses Canada Mexico. 

In case EU, know would accept contracts companies retained liability, AZ could send doses EU country covers liability, probably going send covered country. true vaccine sold cost, sending doses EU results profit, massive risk potential lawsuits. case count total spiking result regional spikes. qualify spike cases? Yes, does. underestimated transmission youth look it. yes current spikes drive infections mainly youth. quote said though, evidence UK. say, cases come light last days weeks. Also, think “they” bit misleading. never official UK government stance, single advisor saying something stupid. online learning way fun.

""Not fun"" ""irrecoverable disaster"" same. none consequences listed anything terribly serious. Almost 3 million people died virus. live year ""unpleasant"" school. distributed according population age distribution, roughly OK.

If distributed according ability transmission prevention, bad. one point Suisse politicians transpired Switzerland can't afford virus mitigation. can't get nottheonion that.

Also, never expected big pharma would allow pictures vaccinated teen yanks dying Spanish pensioners newspaper. pretty much ruined whatever resemblance credibility left delivering strictly according nepotism backroom contracts. Good luck selling optional drugs people public demonstration ethical guidelines. You’re supposed take ibuprofen covid vaccine, lowers efficacy. Don’t second one. say Tylenol okay well try avoid can.  studies combining AZ Covaxin vaccines given US, can't say sure.

If speculate, I'd guess combining AZ J&amp;J would work well, since they're adenovirus vaccines using different vectors, generally using different vectors boosts immunity. There's study going using Sputnik V (another adenovirus vaccine) booster AZ, I'm really optimistic that. Beyond that, expect combining two vaccines hurt. know sure, studies. B.1.1.17 virulent. supported data. areas plateau, others spikes. Depends are. Seriously. Also fact HPV vaccine isn’t also required (just like mumps normal vaccine) another example religious right-white men mysogyniscally run country.

This whole situation pretty shady canada pfizer shots 4 months apart. got first pfizer dose march, get second pfizer shot july. may traveling several high risk locations get another shot US. get jnj pfizer may? three shots total. looks like Pfizer 80% effective one dose, hope makes first choice. think that's true. family got pfizer part said either side effects mild. grandma got moderna vaccine mild side effects first dose. second dose felt horrible like flu even days still nausea. assumed significant advantages single shot. guarantee getting severe covid really enough me, I'm glad got Pfizer shot. Thank prefer hey country gives choice, blood clots pretty sure happen every vaccine, confirmed happened already 3 think. bought bait, banned fishing lol frank CDC would advise even large gathering right now.

Make 3 hour special go it. Love show. There's AMA going right sub host Week Virology.  He's concerned vaccines becoming ineffective variants cell response unchanged even antibody response lower. I've read symptoms might immune response adenovirus vector J&amp;J vaccine, rather immune response covid spike protein happens often 2nd doses rna vaccine. CDC suggesting forever.

Well, Texas cases still going down. guess really tried could also say flexible WFH less time commuting, free time. exactly justify everything though lol linked CDC guidance first reply you. Seems optimistic hope so! planning increasing speed insane amounts?

Yes. Check [this (and enable option ""Praxen impfen""). around mid-May (that's 5 weeks away) vaccine shipments expected arrive faster actually vaccinate. longer supply constrained things go really fast. Yeah, talking AZ anti-vaccine. However, still stories never get debunked typically occur Pfizer. seems oddly glossed every time.... don’t think family members die COVID would negative effect children? US could bidding war USA little brother, UK. want money, print it. EU needs funding secured first independent central bank. defensive. Please call things know thinking. know history, repeat it. EU approved bought Sputnik V see them. Slovakia approved bought doses accord.

And setting completely new factory takes lots time, really shortage vaccines (in West) anymore. really matter much. think rule thumb vaccinated don’t get tested. That's irrelevant, matters included figures provided US, figures Germany. guess I’m looking link concrete CDC guidance  place get free beer. J&amp;J similar AZ, similar side effects. main difference study disign one-dose-applications. J&amp;J good single AZ mRNA vaccine, better. apply second dose, realized earlier AZ second dose vector first almost useless. J&amp;J also concepted two-dose vaccine first, thus 60% effectiveness take weeks Germany overtake U.K. Besides, reasonable people U.K. happy EU vaccinating much quicker rate means lives saved. I'm going get first dose vaccine tomorrow, I'm sure one. could AstraZeneca one, Indian Covaxin dead virus vaccine. 

I plan moving States months, vaccine shortage I'm sure I'll able get second shot properly. option tomorrow since I'm going health problems best get vaccinated tomorrow.

Will fine get ones available US can't get time here? usually dangerous? willing take risk wedding everyone vaccinated, absolutely miniscule risk vaccinated people transmitting virus enter mind. COVID-19 tests always reliable honestly risk unvaccinated person infecting others (perhaps tested early infected testing got false negative) much higher concerns vaccinated guests getting others sick. We’ve also spent past year continuously gaslit friends, family, coworkers, etc. things haven’t bad seem one know gotten “that bad.”

Great, problem solved! bet paying amount tuition well stakes what's important, people stop driving kids cinema too, case crash way. Fact: drop COVID cases started weeks first vaccine dispensed.

I’m gunning 5 days/week office — 2-3 sounds great — certainly wouldn’t quit job option. People must confident job market. Well UK contract supposedly states 100M first UK doses would supplied UK only. 

The EU contract similar provision, state UK plants used first 300M doses. Also states third party obligation reduce supply EU; thus rumors EU blocking exports, actually AZ enforcing contract. Exactly like AZ regards UK supply chain. 

That UK plants currently used supply EU perhaps contract breach - contract state UK plants MUST used EU supply, heavily misleading AZ include UK plants EU contract. never, ever intended supply single dose UK EU (as EU UK contract fulfilled end year). Also four plants contract instead one two, gives impression AZ much bigger production capability have. 

While AZ perhaps law side, I’m extremely disappointed acts.  favor government easing restrictions eligible adults ample time opportunity get vaccine?

Who thinks need keep restrictions place everyone including kids vaccinated?

I know cliche talk ""goal post moving"", I'm seeing talk ""i feel safe kids vaccinated too."" Well relief. got 2nd Pfizer earlier today hoping nasty effects would gone Saturday am.  Awesome. Thanks work dude. I'm contractor, marketing bank. person charge account wants back ""because want see office"" like I'm decoration. want scream. would buildings proportionally smaller well? workplace still temperature checks everyone walking door, even though scientists saying they're ineffective year now.

Yes UK New Zealand exactly virus arrived countries exactly time! 

Based post history different country's subs got agenda troll. prioritized old comorbidities hospital admissions. Overrun hospitals scary issue everyone. can't imagine risk averse. absolutely can't wait basically everything last terrible year. get 2nd Pfizer shot tomorrow. think there's room middle ground. science definitely suggests vaccines prevent transmission. know certain, there's still chance immediate reopening, even could somehow effectively restrict fully vaccinated, could cause new spike needless deaths. eliminate possibility maintain measures another couple months enough people vaccinated know certain danger. Really? 6 yr old deal social isolation learning via screen without long term consequences kid particular overall generation? remember time older generation would give almost anything see younger ones thrive.

Almost pandemics we’ve seen recent memory thankfully died becoming widespread around world. virus super fatal extremely infectious mandating vaccines even ones emergency authorization reasonable especially context college high risk congregate setting. Montagnier, like many prominent scientists, misinformed, misguided, both. biggest mistakes pandemic assuming public stupid and/or malicious.

And media always amplifies worst both. reality, vast majority population actually able weigh risks make correct decisions.

""We wipe X industrial grade disinfectant every customer.""

OK great, talk building's ventilation system. Keep mind many reported deaths lag actual date death weeks even months oftentimes, actual situation likely far better reported deaths may suggest. True, smaller population probably easier spread inside school buildings maintain distance easily. Re-infection happens rare. probably happens people make good immune response. Natural infection healthy people give immunity lasts years. Memory cells make antibodies cells last long time. mean, that's issue. doubt vaccine per say, I'm worried production itself, fact either want to, material show standards. 

Slovakia also asked Hungary, EU country using it, data give anything per contract. secret, time sharing data crucial defeat pandemic? real explanation think of, again, quality production simply standards. political game. app check company vehicles available public?

A bad reaction within body shitty efficacy don’t understand mRNA integrate Human genome, even entering nucleus cells order create spike protein trigger immune response. mRNA vaccines enter cell enter ribosomes spit spike protein trigger immunological response. mRNA pretty much universally goes one way nucleus cell code proteins via transcription.  
This non issue general ERVs make small portion human genome already, it’s essentially junk coding happens part close nothing.  
Even make change genome, wouldn’t mRNA vaccine way mRNA go back nucleus copy human DNA.  
Now talking adenovirus vector vaccines, probably different subject since use viral DNA make body produce spike proteins, bad faith argument make way many “ifs” School opened proper safety measures. school district open since last September without outbreaks. lucky woman live long, lucky son around 92 years! true USA Europe, rest world P.1 Indian variant (India, Blangadesh Pakistan rise cases) competing UK one. much information SA variant, noticed spread lot Africa general. 

We keep mind even variants fighting dominant, maybe following logic tropics experiencing wild variants, temperate countries seeing rise UK variant mostly, SA discovered last year, climate factor explain little variants damage. There's still lot know corona, year studies yet. You’re arguing depressed doesn’t mean you’ll kill yourself. Couldn’t argue covid doesn’t mean you’ll automatically die? J&amp;J well.

A little injection site soreness right after, vaccine diffused went away hour so.

All best! Yea want define young adults. 

I keep seeing statistics manipulated make things seem worse amount “young adults”.

For example, usually see young adult age range defined “18-54”, that’s ridiculous range selected make death rate/hospitalization rate look worse is.

If people really knew death/hospitalization rate typical 18-35 year old example, wouldn’t nearly scared virus. Good thing got mine already  J&amp;J vaccine site city shut yesterday many negative reactions happening. Considering NZ temporarily suspending entry citizens traveled India recently, bans **should** work opposed orange daddy. since corrected. Flanders region overall change projected numbers J&amp;J published last week. Additionally, far aware, US completely destroyed infrastructure general practitioners, Germany, vital functioning system brings medical service even smallest communities.

I'm talking that. I'm talking constant ill-informed bullshit spewed site American healthcare system, included. Plus, condescending way tried make point. Try better. Israel started see dramatic drop cases around 50% adults one dose, could start see dramatic effect much sooner June. Hopefully end April started decline low case counts. got second dose Moderna yesterday. day first shot, really tired. fine good nights sleep.

CCs get allocated money number students seats, went remote March last year number frozen date February 2020. remains way long CC remains online, though decides go back, old allocation method returns. bet reopen, would significantly less students coming class last February.

This mistake is. American, describe exactly, 100 percent, would expect big pharma allow. Europeans don’t see side pharmaceutical industry governments created protections shield worst it. depends kinda cons folks Otakon DC think going get go ahead Well, that's valid take, risk lives convenient them. Another way put would risk lives likely blowback people blame lives lost, like allowing non-essential retail operate people warned danger, number lives risked small enough noticed large scale, like baseball game. Yeah, sucks. liked daily post. course  Says you, guy posted sources all.

It possible find exactly looking seems journalist taken time work close came overloading health care system.

However right daily admissions extremely low amount beds occupied already low.

Do source verifies overloaded? recollection emergency nightingale hospitals used outside dozen patients. L.A. roaring back life Ah thought experiencing something weird. Pretty much thing, J&amp;J fever chills, aches bad tossed turned bed like 6 hours. Especially lower back legs, felt like muscle spasms.

It's 24 hours managed get 4 hours sleep, woke 80% symptoms vanished. weirded thing. someone please walk process pharmacist administers Janssen vaccine? come pre-packaged needs simply taken plastic box injected? syringe + bottle involved separately packaged? something else entirely?

I know concerns irrational, please bear with. healthcare workers incredible people, nothing them. helps get full picture help understand all. coronavirus originated CHINA! Chinese communist regime probed, prosecuted, charged tried murder. covered pathogen spread four corners globe schedule second dose weekend (or time working)?

My understanding big deal reschedule, pretty big window get second dose. Using mass vaccination centers solution, guy implying. There's different ways suit needs differing countries. sure what's hard understand this. sure noticed mental health issues actually predate covid. Also little bonus tidbit, mental health issues cured simply changing aspect one issue. example, 8 year old who's mother died covid, still depressed death even applebees 100% capacity. Humans complex....  hope get keep free hand sanitizer dispensers everywhere. Alchoal-based sanitizers kill bacteria viruses alike, way they'll never able develope resistance to. people sanatizing using public high-touch surfaces always net positive. Bolsonaro attacked forcing citizens work causing even poverty. Maybe people using Reddit part zoom class everyone afford lockdowns especially third world country like Brazil studies like get published. mean didn’t read paper maybe data better sounds sounds like trash. lay media picks up, makes wonder reporters understand correlation vs causation, levels evidence, really understand anything. originated CHINA!!! CCP probed, prosecuted, penalized, charged tried crruption murder Even October Germany fewer deaths comparable countries, vaccine campaign never Merkel's responsibility.

So hard see would total fuckup someone keeps talking about. French here: upvote. sure « they want world comment » you’re unfortunately right anti vaxx sentiment seems typical us.
I truly hope getting vaccinated serve role models others ultimately incite much people possible get dose, ain’t optimistic that. sequenced  majority cases trial. US, 96% cases sequenced old version circulating throughout 2020. consistent studies show maximum population incidence US 4% February new variants.

where find info?  Congratulations!

I'm hoping US gets eventually, can't help think evangelical antivaxxers going screw us end. understand EU fucked up, let ask this: vaccine that’s developed EU company manufactured EU company EU soil? US Moderna J&amp;J. China Sinovac, Sinopharm, etc. UK Oxford/AZ. EU none, that’s problem. EU forced Sanofi Bayer company onto Biontech instead letting partner Pfizer, probably wouldn’t discussions.

The US also bet big AZ initially, ordering 500m doses since AZ 5x cheaper vaccines. supposed main vaccine general population. didn’t pan out, government tapped Moderna Pfizer make deficit ordering 100m each. didn’t December/January didn’t to. vaccine companies balk idea last minute orders? Well, Moderna absolutely oblige request never sell single vaccine anyone anywhere world don’t. Pfizer oblige Moderna would happily take business didn’t. EU none leverage. Bolsonaro nothing wrong First new CDC study provides strong evidence mRNA COVID-19 vaccines highly effective **preventing** SARS-CoV-2 infections real-world conditions among health care personnel, first responders, essential workers. emergancy, understand train random people give vaccines.

I'm one random people. Got trained 10 hours online training 10 hours face face. really easy, intramuscular vaccines hard get wrong. hard part really stuff around -- records, consent, patient communication, that. I'm responsible it, still need know works duty ensure I'm jabbing right person free will.

Anyone training bit experience professionally interacting people could it. know anyone j&amp;j, 2 pfizer.

pfizer sore arm first shot. severe flu symptoms 
including vomiting, 4 days second.

rest us moderna, first shots ranged sore arm hospitalization (family friend severe reaction). second shot ranged nothing, 4 days moderate flu symptoms. myself, sore arm first 2 days moderate flu symptoms second. it’s disingenuous claim children largely staying home last year Better I’ve heard Walmart experiences people crowded maskless idiots refuse get vaccine. Eh, real waste, look Russians managed use purposes. Maskirovka best. massive lack primary care physicians? information outdated, I'm happy learn, certainly massive topic years ago. think condescending, honestly care. simply included facts prevalance physicians general statement ""this way it"" certainly wrong. Healthcare systems vastly different. That's fact. judgement first sentence. want read something it, thats problem, mine. Running six weeks behind US. 

It's bad compared EU people always measure US first happened, positive impression country. full year waiting Japan let pursue research RIKEN, absolutely hate country bureaucratic mechanisms preventing getting started. I’m fully vaccinated too, there’s end sight entry restrictions. 90% effective *preventing* COVID infections. 

As two people exact level exposure, vaccinated person 90% less likely get infected. There's nothing conflicting that.

Your anecdote friends meaningless.

The CDC study shows vaccinated workers infected COVID far lower rate unvaccinated workers.

There's absolutely possible way interpret evidence vaccinated people test positive higher rates unvaccinated people. completely wrong. What? source would nice, considering source says population-weighted 3 times more. source reason wrong, why? There’s story every year salmonella Romaine (or something) causing illness big region. Wash damn fruit veggies. Same. thought 3 weeks making appointment actually getting jab longest nope 4 weeks seem like going way longer. Wow totally made royal ass yourself. 

By using logic, see many children died car crashes next time car child say ""I guess cool dead children putting child risk, you, Ttoughnuts?!""  UK variant one worry about, it’s going sweep cause major casualties among youth. Entirely new vaccines needed, kind normal possible. old normal gone good. No, sincerely held religious belief. It’s uncommon. would worry it! Hope picks side soon! 3.81m average week, Moderna delivers upper range. 

There rumour Moderna's last week deliveries might get cancelled, Moderna denied that.

We might even get 700k J&amp;J month. No, it’s provable said likely, fairly likely case given cases much lower months ago higher risk populations largely vaccinated now. bother them. people want live fear isolation, ignore data feed misleading news long term effects novel. Never mind effects children isolate years. Slovakia approve anything, that's whole point (and reason Russians angry. mean tons states removing restrictions. Pointing one thing blaming increase cases ignoring that. First thought: ""wow kid age 10?""

Second thought: ""wow used good math.""

I hope get see parents 100. believe Pfizer released statement affirmatively saying preliminary data suggests vaccine still effective versus SA variant. holds up, I’d expect that—at minimum—to true Moderna too. You’re lucky! :) probably plenty good immune cells forming, didn’t deal felt like flu. Win/win head hurt badly legit worried line Worst Headache Life had. suffer migraines, like seen horrifying headaches, class own. triggered actual migraine, I'm looking four five days shot everything's said done. remember kids ever locked up. False. US citizen ever prevented entering US. פוגרס remember washing hands every time touched little things like doorknob, door handle etc. hearing feel relieved relax. great news. totally get sunburnt cloud cover. Cheap technicality. 

My point stands. feel safe two weeks second shot? thought end goal? lucky. 

But imagine lived 110+, got see child die old age 90+. would bizarre experience. got J&amp;J 2 hours ago.  Provides ""strong evidence""...

If read further, specifically states estimated 90% effective/

So double-speak...

Don't get wrong, I'm getting vaccinated. get second shot next week. I'm also buying bullshit conflicting statements.

And personally know ten people tested positive virus (not presented symptoms) getting fully vaccinated. That's ten 70 people social group (excluding ""internet friends"") 2 tested positive people got vaccinated.

So percentages vaccinated people STILL testing positive higher vaccinated.

Basically, CDC article linked shows. get significant raise get promoted. Otherwise stagnate. appears far fewer odds child dying drive hospital roughly actually dying COVID, higher. 40s, consider ""young adult"". time I'd even define someone 30s young adult trying less-than-honest make point.

In fact, definitions ""young adult"" I've seen legitimate studies 18-22 18-25. 5 789. 5 ""elite athletes"" pre-existing conditions getting covid? heart damage extreme training maybe substances training? ""Elite athletes"" represent normal adult used represent normal adult population. People tend think ""elite athletes"" best case scenario humans try extrapolate ""well *they* bad case happen rest population?"" know. we're ""elite athletes."" water sports. miss fishing tho Damn yeah sorry didn’t read full post. Maybe seek second opinion. Perfect, thank :-) So, seems like person new syringe taken sealed package them, vial 5 different syringes inserted. understand correctly? doesn’t explain low death rate compared population. force majeure clause would still allow voiding renegotiating contract, even long term deal.

A choice choice. one forced anything. Could business suffer make choice results greater capacity? Sure. People make bad choices time. Attaching economic incentive choice change fact choice.

Coercion defined ""the practice persuading someone something using force threats."" That's happening situation. application force State. threat leveled State. incentive. analogy could insurance premiums - there's economic incentive non-smoker (lower premiums), that's coercion. situation plays - venue owners require proof vaccination sell tickets (making money - economic incentive), not.

Are ethical grey areas? Sure, whole dang world shades grey. think particularly troubling/murky ethical area? No, don't, especially things discussed implemented (not discussed publications like one linked - hysterical take I've seen often past weeks). vaccine passports violate HIPAA, violate anyone's Constitutional rights, seem pretty common sense response ongoing public health crisis. view vaccine passports like view social distancing masks - possibly inconvenient uncomfortable, sensible, temporary, likely save lives little personal effort involved. truly understand minds people view stuff kind oppression.

We're still pandemic. Daily documented infections plateaued 7 day average 66,000, deaths downward trajectory (thank god) mid-700s. We're months away actually beating goddamn virus everyone pull direction. Really interesting perspective end there. I've heard lot people complain effectively creating 2 tier society one half gets work home comfort trek work thought point people staying home actually improve things still commuting. ...

Best luck fast! one never quite understood change clothes write code headphones on. ""source"" vanity fair, entertainment fashion rag, twitter echo chamber believes. makes sense. logical. still people see WFH temporary condition exception rather live work. see work happening offices “go work,” like 1940s 1950s. 

WFH fully implemented decade ago, capabilities, took Covid businesses done. done reason ever really go back.

Some companies realized this, people know told offices permanently closed (leases already terminated) company switching full time WFH. larger companies said kind small office meeting rooms, another said use coworking spaces still anticipates needing occasional conference space meetings, needs people locked offices record keeping compliance (can’t use open coworking desks), likes mailbox message services offer.

This likely future. people need offices specific issues record keeping privacy prevent using open coworking desks company offices reserves conference rooms meetings as-needed.

I don’t problem office occasional meeting, (key “can be”) value monthly quarterly in-person meeting; making good first impression client in-person difference making deal making deal. sitting office day sit makes sense, never did.

The CDC director stated seeing younger adults 30s 40s admitted severe cases Covid-19, Centers Disease Control Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Wednesday.

Can show tables, data, visualizations, etc. showing this? would leave house flu? Stay home don’t spread anyone else. Pfizer's data 1 week post second shot Moderna's data 2 weeks post second shot. simplicity messaging CDC told everyone full protection 2 weeks second shot. Hence lack awareness.

Lack supply, vaccinations done centers. there’s broader rollout. got mine pharmacy last week. asked front left right arm. waited around 15 minutes. turn, chair wrong way. sat down, turned take shot requested arm, apologized get turn chair around.

It's fine really, asking arm front silly. see point got operation like described. According you, asking source verify statement made disingenuous. shows true agenda: misinformation. literally alternative.

I sub year never seen person discussed, certainly mass implied. far **NONE YOU** provide single example happening. 

You're showing hand. makes easy ignore you. Nobody's talking society moving - we're talking effectively forcing people take vaccine that's EUA.

While believe vaccines ridiculously safe tend fall side spectrum (I would gladly taken vaccine last summer Phase 2 complete - earlier - would encouraged elderly parents same), think FDA authorization matters, can't well pretend there's reason FDA full use authorization exists convenient so.

It’s part defense production act. I'm generally , can't mechanically add two numbers people groups (previously infect vaccinated). We've got 33% least one dose 30% prior infection. third prior infection group also vaccinated, get 53% immunity. That's really rough estimate accounts people groups. 53% great number, think we're already seeing benefits, I'd like add another 20% (hopefully mostly vaccinated side) start going ball games again. hit couple months. true. Biden continues policy. comes randians great logic comparing one populus country island population less towns India.  could see type hybrid system, remote learning backup in-class available. think it’ll still awhile students cold/flu symptoms allowed crowded classrooms. also likely continue sporadic COVID cases among unvaccinated (who still need quarantine), continue circulate among young children, likely won’t vaccinated September.

The CAAV stressed importance using mechanism vaccine passports entering Vietnam, quick re-opening international commercial flights becoming urgent.

Those hold vaccine passports confirming received COVID-19 vaccinations tested negative coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 using Real-time PCR technique allowed enter Vietnam concentrated quarantine period minimised.

Vietnam currently legal regulations relating implementation vaccine passports country, CAAV said, emphasising need carry relevant agreements Governmental inter-ministry levels Vietnam countries apply international visitors entering leaving Vietnam.

A top official authority said necessary apply technology certifying vaccine injections negative test results restart international passenger transport early effectively.

Using e-data would limit falsification vaccine passports negative test results, detected several countries, CAAV added.

It also stressed need mutual recognition well system links countries.

The CAAV earlier submitted plan Ministry Transport reopening international flights three stages.

Only “combo” flights Vietnamese citizens resume first phase. Vietnamese carriers work partners, diplomatic missions, localities arranging quarantine areas. “combo” ticket includes flight ticket, COVID-19 testing, quarantine, living costs, vehicle picking passengers airport taking hotels quarantine.

The second phase set begin July, regular flights bringing passengers Vietnam restarting. Upon arrival, passengers must stay quarantine.

Flights initially routes Vietnam Japan, Republic Korea, Taiwan (China). number weekly flights arriving Vietnam total 24, 7,000 passengers going quarantine.

The third phase may begin September, depending COVID-19 vaccination process Vietnam assessment herd immunity that. Passengers flights need go quarantine upon arrival, vaccine passports place.

The CAAV said plan applied countries territories accept effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines Vietnam authorised use./.

UK right? pretty vague, higher number really mean much. rate hospitalization near younger people theres thats saying vaccine working me.

I'd imagine skews results I'm smart area... Thanks help nEeD oPeN sKoOolS !!! :000 well science says vaccines 100% effective. sticking point ppl like care spread virus others yet vaccinated, long wind hospital. actually goes heart America's chief character flaw: selfish egoism. I'm worried way tv shows things tv suitable kids covid. worried getting flu getting covid. wife son 2.5 time get even sniffle. he's anything like I'm worried stupid wreckless stuff cause injuries covid. Thanks valuable input discussion.  surprising realize Moderna dose 100 mcg Pfizer dose 30 mcg.

The ideal dose minimum needed achieve immunity, minimize reactions. determine studies err side much. Since Pfizer Moderna work, logical propose cut Moderna dose 30 mcg. got study actually it, I'm sure already progress, since works would triple doses Moderna producing. state obligated accommodate needed. point reasonable chance stunted social development miniscule risk physical ailment harm. textbook hypochondriac still fears disease getting vaccinated it. 

You bombarding articles supposedly proving point especially shows that.

Also explanation 95% efficiancy, also shows understand vaccine efficiencys all, even thos 5% get symptomatic disease, severity drastically reduced. 

There single reason fear disease getting vaccine, especially rare reversible symptoms sperm count reductions etc.

You get help living much fear healthy longterm.

Also dont get fearing covid case. viral infections cause symptons, albeit nit frequent.  AZ restricted supplying countries UK plants? Conveniently, EU/AZ contract includes UK factories source deliveries. post let decide answer. people see here. point saving later. bullish mRNA vaccines given results COVID vaccines. work quickly reprogrammed. protein nanoparticle vaccines also interesting want first see long immunity lasts. I'd like see us move away injected vaccines, micro needle patch, put skin band aid, seems poised that. 600.0 enough surely prize: going movies months early? wearing mask weeks?

I detailed reply detailing want find it, no, prize going movies months early. prize missing year social development schooling absolutely crucial children. ""52% effective first dose"" kind misleading like ""negligibly effective first week, slightly effective second week, like 85% effective 2 weeks"" No, exactly described. arm hurt like hell. Literally felt like punched arm, thats all. Dose 2 something else entirely. responses reddit describing same. 12 hours dose, straight flu like symptoms. Chills, Fever, Soreness over, Huge headache, bed day.

My wife inlaws fine however =? Go figure. plan accordingly might need take day off. following day felt good enough work, still little it, functional. Lets go LA care world covid Im still That’s misattributing preference single mass sites administration they’ve *never* expressed. single site thousands vaccinations day argument smaller clinics unless show one takes away other’s ability. Mass vaccination sites small minority vaccination clinics places aren’t well suited need social distancing makes laborious doesn’t mean aren’t getting shots people’s arms. They’re always going minority total shots. doesn’t mean don’t serve purpose Teens three free, teen three free, teen three free, teen three free, teen three free, teen three free, teen three free... existing COVID19 vaccines time started producing Pfizer that's comparable.

And would ever take away capacity vaccines EUA, vaccine *may* granted EUA.

Sounds like sour grapes money companies executive. looked CDC's guidelines mass vaccination sites. claim 30 vaccinations per hour per vaccination station. every 3 minutes spot.  fact variants may evade antibody immunity evade cell immunity: cell epitopes variants largely unchanged.

Could possibly clarify difference two vaccine produces responses difference responses vaccinated individual vs someone infected virus itself? Would infected virus protected variants vaccinated? data bit old, no? Otherwise Canada little bit trouble. Thought read 80%+ first dose (after 2 weeks). common misconception mild influenza. Coming close behind fiction virus originated lab China.  think AZ supplying Australia case, UK used supply stock flown Aus. 

The article implies AZ decided AstraZeneca’s decision send vaccines UK [...]

It's quite possible UK government aware it, officially commented matter. would hold long can.

On first dose, went 28 hours broke take advil headache - got point bad couldnt even keep eyes open gave in.

There evidence taking drugs reduce immune response (not tested covid vaccine others) say take anything right after. Thats like two weeks first dose. still minimum wait second two weeks going out. welcome, glad helpful. thinking today start podcast called 'The Grumpy Virologist'.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Thursday morning, deny 717,000 doses manufactured UK sent Australia said **it Government made shipment.**

Yeah, that... Seems like yesterday first person 90 first shot! share production capacity rest world. didn’t ask, though ask would okay take sleeping pill last night said would fine, so. think I’ve read elsewhere taking painkillers day could somehow make vaccine less effective? jesus christ garbage never said govt others wrong.
But problem comparisons made logically people like you.

Look per capita covid/death vaccination making stupid comparisons. phase 2 results Molnupiravir look great. hope phase 3 completed soon orally available drug could make big difference. sad news older drug could ready use beginning 2020. I’m 31. US trial received vaccine. Completely fine. typical symptoms shot # 1 Oh know is. people may affected disease understand feel way, there’s part feels way.

We’ve also spent past year continuously gaslit friends, family, coworkers, etc. things haven’t bad seem one know gotten “that bad.” continue act cautiously, probably public health experts suggest. Finally zombie apocalypse comming. Loot ammo guys Funny mention Palestine downvoted removed ""being political"". this, subreddit non political. fact, taking political stance supporting status quo. Discussing Israel vaccinated many people without talking removing discussion system enables political stance. UK close. would getting vaccine hurt wife/daughter? Wow realize given size country. That's even less excuse NZ gov. 100 percent agree you. want vaccine fine, accept risk (if young, probably fine, like college student). take it, good you. open schools jeez maybe would've comfortable speaking person. person interactions meeting made comfortable me.

(I also think true generally. internet talks lot vehment anti maskers they're tiny tiny part population) Well, first, voting right, whereas seeing Falcons play home game stadium not, makes sense remove barriers one things let private industries make decisions other. 

Second, responding contagious disease brought country knees requires different population-level responses unfounded accusations voter fraud (especially multiple investigations claims never proven true).

Then course there's whole technical aspect - people losing connection, audio issues, etc, simply exist everyone one place. 

None say digital tools useless, meeting person sometimes efficient. Prove you’re currently infected. Yeah, “everything’s anecdotal” hand-waving disingenuous, science-denying trope. daily supply vaccine Germany. read another news Phizer vaccines started produced Sanofi production site France. production Phizer-Biontech vaccines greatly improved right now. 

The source see one. could figure access daily dat vaccine distribution Europe. vaccination takes much shorter time 15 minutes. One dose per minute possible right setup preparation.

Unbelievable stupidity. missing point... sister's family Covid months ago. Three tested negative, three tested positive. symptoms. Covid tests good enough travel like this.

EU big vaccine exporter I'm obligation prove damn thing you. behavior exactly I'm talking about. yelling people Reddit sharing anecdotes personally experienced demanding proof. Pot meet kettle.

Yep sucked. Every monday. wasnt risking spreader KEEP IT! specified vaccine made appointment. That's awful roll out... come EU dropped ball here. really seem ridiculous vaccine started roll huge push reopen schools soon possible across multiple states. One good friends pumped wanted get kids back school house. hes dealing kids back home contact someone got sick school. state barely 20% pop fully vaccinated.



The 2020-2021 wash. knew vaccine going available late 2020. knew would go vulnerable first. knew would takes months ramp production distribute. importantly knew wouldnt approved people age 18.


The goal targeting normal 2021-2022 school year. governments sending vaccines non citizens

Yes, Israel vaccinates Palestinians work reside Israel. also tried multiple times give vaccines Palestinians general refused PA. Go ahead interprete wrote like. issue kids go crazy time parents well. fucking reason stop outdoor sports activities forcing kids go school, happening address. yes, outdoor activities general virtually irrelevant. Last summer, everything open, numbers super low. moment weather went bad ppl stayed inside, shit hit fan I'm Florida pretty much conventions wanted go year announced convention 2022. cons happening extremely limited otherwise Very, slight risk that. messaging awful. dumb. Yes, infected original strain (there still one strain SARS-CoV-2). people make strong immune response may re-infected. There's actually science says we're social creatures people stop distancing wearing masks everyone will. agree communication poor need give involuntarily unvaccinated time get doses moving on. can't tell whether simply explaining sticking it. hope former. question meant actually ask why, dismay people traveling unnecessarily pandemic. Variants spreading mutations occurring, need importing exporting people miss family want travel internationally. chance lowered 90+% too! Maybe long covid, despite ever tested positive it. CDC says cook steaks well done.

Make will. things aside, cannot possibly claim AstraZeneca handled well. Initially set deliver 120M Q1, target decreased little 40M. even goal reached, 29M actually delivered. projections Q2 looking good either.

But problem actual deliveries, also communicated. Pfizer/Biontech initial production problems, transparent it, communicated soon possible gave estimate long would take fix. issue even remotely near scale AZ's issues.

AstraZeneca hand late communicate shortfall reluctant share information. Deliveries constantly hard know expect when. AFAIK even explained huge issues. mild side effects 1st shot really nothing 2nd. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

AZ well UK death case rates plummeting. people would've died without vaccine would certainly agree waiting, would families. People also breaking point lockdowns live.

 Maybe privileged position affect lot people badly impacted pandemic. Also lot countries cannot afford vaccines. obviously fortunate position.  CDC waived quarantine requirements fully vaccinated showing symptoms travel. really preference though. risk fully vaccinated drops 90-95%. personally would tell people need get tested fully vaccinated May 1st otherwise get test. believe possible SARS-CoV-2 came lab. Certainly intentionally, also accidentally. one working virus anywhere near SARS-CoV-2 lab. virus came bat many CoVs. sorts lab origin ideas arise new outbreak, animal reservoir identified stop. told Columbia's plans vaccination fall semester. depends, require vaccinations. never required flu shot example.

And complicate matter, young people already Covid, already protection. need vaccinated? Terrible. come to? Dividing country medication ... thanks, again! understood meant “s thing”, you’d comprehended comment better. there. Many times. didn’t it.

It preventable. Depression, matter bad, predispose outcome. people make choice sure, friends, families, authority figures also intervene help person deal situation, especially case children. mitigation tactics Covid way harmful seat belts. way stop car accidents socializing going school think would worth it. try school board school board. underfunded schools wouldnt even consider guidance counselor students....look student counselor ratio states allow religious exemptions anymore (NY one believe) Admittedly, I'm hesitant vaccinate kids (4, 1, one way) one right away like myself. They're little, bodies still developing I'm bit worried long term effects. one available I'll need talk family GP get opinion. No, don’t. hope gets better soon Siva mites Probably least 10 years. development tested since one going throw 24 billion dollars (what done get COVID vaccines US) take longer. mean case necessarily. But, Americans, you’re right. Oxford/Astrazeneca giving small, reliable number blood clots. well, effective SA variant, thus there’s absolutely reason choose something else predominant strain region SA variant. is, strain tailored vaccines/boosters become available Specially USA

n Florida beach parties pandemic.  Great! settles it, thanks. I’m clear makes wrong I’m sure virologists wouldn’t biased considering massive effect would field true. isn’t obviously ... cleared up. Ok, remote learning sucks. agree.

Do point make beyond that? Bring back bulk bins please! Everything went zero waste plastic real quick hope get back zero waste. loved bringing jars store filling whatever available, stores like sprouts pre package food kind sucks. They're 100% effective stopping severe COVID death, can't choose wrong regard. vaccine teams done incredible job. everywhere, greed sacrificed millions die. thing mentally ill people eventually become dead people. People killed result mental anguish pandemic. want keep sacrificing people’s mental health people won’t die, inevitable, you’re going causing unnecessary deaths. people dying priority, especially vaccines distributed rate extent they’ve effective. thought maybe weak school girl immune system endurance someone sickly. 1918 pandemic likely ended herd immunity. vaccines antivirals then, even virus isolated. good general strategy: look many people died 1918. mean, agree push reopen schools become really emotionally charged issue unfortunate effect pushing science facts side elevating lot really bad faith messaging.

But feel like unfairly indiscriminately harsh things said here. know really frustrating issue seems like many people talking intentionally misleading unwilling hear reason runs counter thing want helpful make blanket attacks moral judgements large groups people. 

In area, lot poorer communities, parents *more* likely want keep kids home one parents getting covid would absolutely devastating entire household, financially. They're working jobs flexible employers forgiving paid sick leave policies. convenient keep kids home stakes really high they're best manage it, even means constant stress exhaustion. lot outcry reopening schools coming wealthier suburbs area. lot parents want mandatory fully person school yet whole slew good reasons.

I think fine pretty cynical people. agree whole thing breathtaking display selfish many us really are. problems address ones can't. Saying people kids unhelpful acceptable solution problem. Okay...so think communism, context communal social structure? I'd love hear take. 

Re: capacity issue. business owner fill venue every event order make rent, 1) run inherently unsustainable business - one gets full capacity every night/event build business assumption would crazy bad idea, 2) would already closed (given reduced capacity mandates past year). Also, business owner would plenty options, charging higher ticket prices, finding uses property turn profit.

It's mandate, choice. moving goalposts make conclusion fit point view. discussion started re: stupid Spectator op-ed written comedian lady, based premise government going force businesses use vaccine passports. That's demonstrably happening (because, informed before, would illegal emergency authorization), likely occur future. asked would happen business want use vaccine passports, stated business would continue operating now. trying make argument allowing businesses utilize vaccine passports operate higher capacity equivalent mandate, dogshit argument. looks like one acting bad faith. adults vaccinated, concerns 17 infected hospitalization rate group low? You’ll see year 2 Testing key! available schools teachers cannot implement it. Face masks, distancing, air circulation important. Hi Dr. Racaniello, question ethics regards vaccine rollout. I’m able work home rarely go out, make sense delay getting vaccinated, spots available someone less lucky? so, determine shift supply/demand is, taking someone else’s spot longer concern? guess, though, would community relatively small means easy students distance buildings? true, put numbers/facts this. 13 1700 people vaccinated reactions (0.8%). 11 treated site juice/water etc. 2 transported. sounds like mostly nausea/fainting issues directly injection waiting period. could mean something, also could coincidence.  covid, feel fine, I’m scared. Time passing slow can’t stop worrying getting worse don’t want alone. explanation think said 70% *eligible* population vaccinated then, it’s possible they’re waiting number 70% total population taking bigger steps Omg exactly happened last night... See, even link proves point.

Protects against, prevent. It’s slightly less efficacious (though still good), it’s single shot lower side effects.

It’s great choice low-risk people. someone actually depressed last 5 years (including thinking “s thing”), tell people alive definitely higher priority preventing much mental illness possible. cases mental illness constant, unbearable agony, makes life bit harder general, still good days even you’re mentally ill. definitely death sentence way. Yes suck, seems many others downplaying degree negative effects it’ll coming years “can deal it”. I’m guessing you’re older side, overall people older age range sacrificed much younger generations despite higher risk, plain simple. Tell potential transmission vector added since beginning March? open ideas, perhaps spring break travel? dropping correct? state still mask mandates limits virtually everything, save alcohol sales continue later evening.  that, live mostly rural county tech infrastructure support distance learning here. tiny community internet options. homes internet access use one satellite internet provider services area. reliable enough support distance learning. kids county went back in-person school early pandemic districts make distance learning work given lack solid tech infrastructure within county. Hospitalizations younger people declining week week country. 

Younger people much less likely die.

There 4th wave coming. pockets cases vaccine stomps what’s left covid US. unfortunately doesn’t matter true, shouldn’t talking public end result Health Council advises cabinet vaccinate people 60 AstraZeneca's vaccine. Minister Hugo de Jonge adopts advice.

Editorial8 April 2021, 18:43
The European Medicines Authority (EMA) said Wednesday benefits AstraZeneca outweigh rare side effects, advised continue. Dutch Health Council draws different conclusion. council announce people already first vaccination AstraZeneca vaccine given opportunity receive second shot.

Minister Health, Hugo de Jonge, asked council issue urgent recommendation vaccine response reports thrombosis lowered platelet counts, rare side effect appears linked vaccine. De Jonge let known taking advice order ""prevent health risks. major consequences planning vaccination strategy time being, according minister. vast majority people 60s yet invited shot; high-risk groups health care workers already vaccinated.

Bart-Jan Kullberg Health Council Netherlands explained decision NOS: ""If choice different vaccines, obvious thing use safely possible. alternatives young group runs small risk. Safety always number one vaccination program. incredibly unfortunate side effect occurring make trade-offs best deploy vaccines people fewest side effects.""

The reports rare combination thrombosis lowered platelet count vaccination previously prompted Netherlands temporarily stop using vaccine people age 60.

Link thrombosis
On Wednesday, EMA concluded likely link AstraZeneca's vaccine rare cases unusual thrombosis. EMA examined 86 reports combination clotting problems platelet deficiency. Eighteen patients died.

There 222 known cases UK Europe, total 34 million vaccinations. Presumably cases known. According EMA, serious side effect occurs less per hundred thousand vaccinations. Netherlands, eight cases reported far, 400,000 vaccinations AstraZeneca's vaccine.

It possible rare side effect due autoimmune reaction. case, immune system would stimulated vaccine turn platelets. patients, all, antibodies platelets detected. makes explanation plausible. addition, side effects occur frequently one would expect without vaccinations. Moreover, manifested within two weeks vaccination. combination three factors - frequent occurrence, shortly vaccination possible mechanism - makes likely, according EMA, vaccine cause. hard evidence yet.

So far, mainly women 60 affected, still unclear whether actually constitute specific risk group. AstraZeneca's vaccine administered group particular. Older people mostly received Pfizer Moderna, AstraZeneca went mainly healthcare workers, recently people 60.

In United Kingdom, 20 million people vaccinated vaccine, spread entire population. There, 79 cases involved far: 51 women 28 men. country, 11 million shots Pfizer also taken. process, two cases unusual thrombosis reported - would expected without vaccinations.

Countries reacting differently problems AstraZeneca conclusions European Medicines Agency. Germany, Italy Spain are, time being, longer vaccinating AstraZeneca people 60 - also Dutch Health Council advises. Belgium set limit 55. United Kingdom, people 30 longer receive vaccine. them, risk ending ICU due corona infection smaller risk complication vaccine.

Translated www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) wrong conclusions. know things 1.1.17. Studies shown B.1.1.17 virulent ancestor animal models, changed course disease UK. explosive growth

No one said ""explosive growth."" growth. 

And data really tell us anything happening regards new hospitalizations 30-50 year olds. entirely produced EU mainly UK fill finish EU? accurately register cause death. Could heart attack, stroke, inflammation, blood clots etc, potentially covid related. whole world playing game since beginning, variance expected deaths, massive reduction expected deaths since everybody locked home 12 months. needs 715k end may vaccinate everyone end July. it’s yet enough, soon be. kids expected isolate covid risk, ARENT going playground.

That nothing schools, policy, literally anything anyone do.

I honestly get trying thread. Point remote learning sucks? Yeah. know. know. well established point literally nobody disagrees. good tracker R number countries? emergency emergency. fact EUA proves emergency. said something true, explain true? think hurts credibility much illustrates ones talking public. AZ vaccine work well S. Africa reasons clear - follow done. made decision use vaccine there. however J&amp;J vaccine worked well despite spike different variant. Can't wait till too. countries band together buckle Brazil’s response? Like involvement outside onto Brazil since they’re pretty much threatening world. moms well done steaks?

My mother way - stopped going dinner went nice steakhouse sent steak back three times done enough. Cook finally came charred, blackened thing, asked satisfactory time happy hell.  vaccines natural infection induce antibody cell responses. Antibodies block infection fail, cells remove infected cell. case cells, infection would provide protection cell epitopes every viral protein, whereas antibody epitopes block infection spike. Spike-only vaccines fewer cell epitopes. people died due politicians idiots, look island countries well handled pandemic, leaders uk plan could’ve easily managed avoid many deaths like New Zealand did. Whole different story countries land borders lots countries. Even worse covid response. Threw away everyone's lives futures could've sheltered risk population mate. talking about? I'm somewhat left-leaning guy prepared potentially get voted saying this, pandemic proving interesting case study merits centralized public health messaging.
