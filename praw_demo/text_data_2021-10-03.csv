(kidding!!) think helpful tidbit we’ve never seen vaccine side effects pop 8 weeks administration, ever. “what if, 10 years…?” boogeyman. 6+ months data millions people now, chance new safety signals occurring minuscule it’s thing consider. suspicions, proposed biological mechanism. anyway fully eliminate covid? mean billions vaccine many still hospitals. hope still?  would send email chain leave alone. protects case something blows up. can, find new place work. honestly think worth hassle would find another job.

Sounds like may prevent serious outcomes (hospitalization, pneumonia, etc) may reduce length typical influenza still counts flu killing though day said majority 2020 early 2021. saw suggestion somewhere online rapid antigen tests good vaccinated. right? I'm going event next weekend everyone asked vaxxed tested. need get PCR test instead? Long-term side effects COVID even unstudied (vaccination easier study since know exactly who's gotten dose, people vaccinated caught covid) far likely serious. Friend said work rule. exposure event vaccinated people like got notice. Anyone vaccinated take two weeks quarantine. said she'd get notice exposure. two problematic coworkers would take unscheduled absence two weeks.  might say make less sad dies rise Trump made initially get interested cults. saw people knew falling line someone clearly conman explanation made sense. think need make significant societal changes make room impressionable people find positive niche communities rather led astray grifter. ability people silo information bubbles exposed certain ideas something needs change well.

I'm sure exceptions exist rare. Yeah took doctor morning developed symptoms assumed covid tested negative positive flu. usually gets flu shot around middle October apparently flu going around now.  needs taken within 48 hours first symptom effect. took right away getting better day later, probably helped. anyone help advice this. wife RN nursing services letting covid positive asymptomatic nurses/doctors still work around patients. wife complained told wasn’t place question short staffed. anyway go this?

Cool thanks answer Empowerment videos people foot community. It’s anti-viral medication would take testing positive. It’s bit like tamiflu flu. oh, sorry, saw J&amp;J/Pfizer/Moderna assumed US.

In country, dosage using boosters? Moderna proposed 50 micrograms (half current dosage shots 1 &amp; 2) FDA.  Hopefully less way side effects that. Source toxicity? Seriously. nothing punch line long remember. gold-plated turd. draw conclusions three numbers.  three confidence intervals overlap. What's word 2 5 year olds? agree need policies incentivize healthy meals. But, month even week eat make obese. son taking tamiflu right wanted sure. started day started symptoms next day starting feel better I’ve heard people didn’t work maybe it’s coincidence? Another thing consider. lot folks go okay (stable) respiratory distress rapidly. live alone see friend family member check frequently. could arrange send text someone agreed upon time someone call you, etc. 

Not trying mother hen, live completely alone anytime something potentially dangerous (like work roof) always let someone know I’m set time call them. Go team! tamiflu minimally effective? get tamiflu whenever anyone house gets sick flu, caught yet. also get vaxxed too.

Covid already many well-known long term symptoms, even particularly rare. Year long loss smell taste, fatigue, disrupted sleep? thanks. even occur kids (which mortality whole story). vaccine seems like obvious choice here. different. Tamiflu (Oseltamivir) enzyme inhibiter prevents certain types influenza viruses exiting infected cells (therefore preventing infecting additional cells). also minimally moderately effective.

Molnupiravir works deliberately introducing copying errors virus' RNA. somehow ends introducing copying errors DNA... well, that's obviously bad news. confirm.

Do masks suck? Absolutely. 

Are effective? Also, absolutely. 

I think masking done away after:
-	Children 6-months vaccinated 
-	There’s sufficient time implement parents willing get vaccine (a month so?)

After that, sure, remove masking. point, anyone vaccinated choice exception children and, unfortunately, that’s going case matter what. 

Masking become choice personal protection, I’m good with. example, we’ll go back wearing area becomes hotspot. we’re going somewhere likely house large population unvaccinated individuals. countries wearing masks consideration others years prior - sure US babies it.

Ah, we're required upload materials within 24 hours class 82% Canadian kids aged 12-17 least one dose. think it’s safe say acceptance rate higher US.

C) danger COVID portrayed consistently media, lots outlets keep singing tune kids don’t get sick it’s mild flu, stats cities don’t even try reflect real situation. Moscow less ‘true’ numbers, cities don’t. city publishing flatline 20-25 deaths day months now. case mean people don’t want vaccine doesn’t really stop covid cause still spread? I’m 13 don’t much reading someone takes vaccine someone doesn’t person decides take ok vaccinated gas opinion vaccinated person calls ass hole death threat asshole grammar bad idk could read correctly Walmart big thief here. I'm alright guy did. Personally, also feel stealing morally wrong, given circumstances, items taken, dude tried. He's probably thrilled steal diapers. raw case numbers, possibly. But, someone else mentioned, case numbers large percentage population vaccinated lead numbers deaths. Delaying impact giving time get people immunised whole point - and, look, exactly easy ride overall successful. vast majority Australia spent pretty much whole 2020 first half 2021 without thinking much pandemic without impact whatsoever. Whose incompetence? cashier, payment terminal, credit card company?

Scary times. Rest Peace, young man. Oh! Thank much I'm saying point cost exceeds benefit (and world agrees, lockdown flu season, even though would prevent deaths). NZ shut many basic freedoms (even outside lockdown periods) prevent many deaths. course sucks people die, prevent deaths less harsh interventions should. go small amount remaining deaths attempt prevent harsh measures. would take Nordic option (excluding Sweden went different way) NZ/AUS strategy heartbeat. Indoctrinating early said? Kyrie Irving flat earth idiot, course also antivax   Wait, you’re saying “deaths close bad flu season” better “negative excess deaths”?? can’t imagine side “more deaths better” demonstrably preventable.  always eager replacements. 48% adults vaccinated, looks like devastating wave.

They 29 new cases today!

What thinking? Many places avoided overcrowded ICUs deaths without telling citizens abroad allowed come home, without attempting elimination general. US way NZ way. Yes, New Zealand excess deaths negative, prevent flu traffic deaths along covid deaths, option letting spread. I'm really happy Nordic country measured restrictions kept deaths close bad flu season level, noone told can't go home. disinformation type spreading actually costing lives, please shut up. nanometers size - never thought possible unless banned forms human movement borders - even North Korea can't that.

It ends vaccination becomes widely available area; (in grim no-vaccine scenario) immunity builds everyone previously infected; world now, combination two. New Zealand admittedly tricky situation entirely reliant vaccination rather combo prior infections + vaccination. interesting see plays out.

Well, next moves pretty well detailed government's plan, depend basically vaccination numbers. International borders start reopening November, initially states 80%+ eligible population vaccinated. Individual states roadmaps internal restrictions reduced. Exactly, that's annoys sainted Jacinda global press, think luck played major role point.

So spend long frank that? bumble vaccine procurement (whilst spinning bullshit actually virtuous act ""other places need more)?

850,815 people caught Covid since vaccines became available; 51,104 people vaccinated, 767,625 we're not. That's 93.4% unvaccinated 6.6% vaccinated, almost exactly trials showed various vaccines.

And trials Delta variant took hold.

One last thing. *Using statistics Georgia extrapolating entire country, 300,000 people avoided death getting vaccinated.* mean - agree zero goal, that's simply realistic. Busses, driving, riding bikes, walking school without risk. kids die choking, even flu school.

We investigated nosocomial COVID-19 outbreak involving SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant among highly vaccinated population. attack rate among exposed individuals reached 23.3% patients 10.3% staff, 96.2% vaccination rate among exposed individuals. Moreover, several transmissions probably occurred two individuals wearing surgical masks, one instance using full PPE, including N-95 mask, face shield, gown gloves. 
 
In recent publication Bernal et al., effectiveness full vaccination Comirnaty vaccine Delta variant high, although lower Alpha variant (88% vs 93.7%) \[9\]. experience Israel, rapid increase cases since June 2021 despite high vaccination rate \[1\]. 
 
Although reports breakthrough infections increasing \[10-12\], communication emphasises several points. challenges assumption high universal vaccination rates lead herd immunity prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. probably true wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus, outbreak described here, 96.2% exposed population vaccinated. Infection advanced rapidly (many cases became symptomatic within 2 days exposure), viral load high. Another accepted view that, facing possible mismatch SARS-CoV-2 variant vaccine waning immunity, combination vaccine face mask provide necessary protection. Although transmission staff members could occurred without masks, transmissions patients staff occurred masked vaccinated individuals, experienced outbreak Finland \[12\]. cannot rule protection measures optimally implemented, however, transmissibility summer 2021 differs experiences previous 18 months. Whether attributed low Cq high transmissibility Delta variant clear. note, cases, particular case patients, time vaccination considerable. shortest interval 142 days (5 months), many case patients advanced severe disease. Data Israel imply main reason increase COVID-19 cases summer indeed waning immunity, third vaccine dose, 5 months second dose possibly result trend reversal \[13,14\]. 
 
  
Conclusion

This nosocomial outbreak exemplifies high transmissibility SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant among twice vaccinated masked individuals. suggests waning immunity, albeit still providing protection individuals without comorbidities. However, third vaccine dose may needed, particularly individuals risk factors severe COVID-19. Appropriate use masks, especially high-risk settings advised. Lead living prophet: Joseph Mercola.

Unfortunately still pay covid, ignore may still get infected. stop think maybe delay FDA review data meeting? know, like things work real world? Maybe verify things, independent analysis?

There's risks everything government guidelines say reducing one ten thousand chance one twenty thousand worth even still low odds. parents say risk worth it.

It's like NZ examples learn too. Look Singapore - similarly low cases, much higher vaccination rate stricter measures place (mask mandate, group size 8 months back), yet still keep Delta contained low double digit daily numbers. Unless NZ intended remain lockdown extended period, inevitable outcome. definitely get treated get it, though. people study hospitalized treated. Myocarditis dangerous untreated. No. There's difference eliminate (zero covid) manage. 
Cases dropping zero. still infected vaccinated.

And that's perfectly fine, risk death/hospitalization much much lower (although zero) should. would say they're medium island, otherwise spot Curious everyone developed myocarditis male, although population studied 54% 2,392,924 KPSC members received least 1 dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, 50.2% received mRNA-1273 50.0% BNT162b2. cohort, 54.0% women, 31.2% White, 6.7% Black, 37.8% Hispanic, 14.3% Asian individuals.

(Hank Hill makes bwaaaaahhh face) tragic infuriating. makes feel damn helpless, getting shot save others still enough here. would specifically doubt competence Novavax — miss something?

Or mean broad assumption distrust rather targeting specifically? know likely virus would mutate towards less dangerous direction. far done opposite.

The variant left Wuhan worse original Wuhan one. Alpha worse Delta worse Alpha. infect easier also cause serious symptoms.

Now failed vaccination campaign puts virus huge evolutionary pressure circumvent immunity. mixed vaccinated open society huge infection numbers. begs tragedy.

In UK report specialists say there's even realistic possibility virus mutate towards MERS like lethality rates. would mean 10-30% lethality rate. really want give even 1% chance mutating way?

I'm pretty sure would led that, therefore confident made try ""win"" - nobody take seriously. friends elder care home residents? 

Now making things up. young vaccinated person dying would likely news, happens rarely. 

Really, posts bad anti vaxxers. ones know say friend died vax people know vax side effects. 

Both clearly bullshit people lie win internet arguments Happy did! I'll get booster shot mRNA soon well! Yikes! magic virus. behaves like others. VT here, it’s true us month well. Alaska even North Dakota November. It’s crazy nobody seems care areas access fake COVID vax card less Covid circulating areas restricting access. benefiting everyone vaccine area significantly disadvantaged guard down. milk supply dipped couple ounces day. Moderna - day. It’s super hard stop milk supply. Women continue produce milk months even years weaning.  Antivax idiots working hard make sure unsafe Boston annex lot neighbors.

Boston annexed: Roxbury, Dorcester, Brighton, Charleston, Hyde Park. Hyde Park recent, 1912.

Boston failed annex Brookline late 19th century, seems turning point slowed things down. said it’s “too soon tell.” People indeed misinterpreting mean said no. think might delta variant. started sneezing bunch last night, thinking it’s allergies bc 2 cats. blowing nose night could barely sleep. morning woke bad headache still sneezing bunch, forehead warm might light fever. Also feeling super drowsy. stomach ache lack appetite - normal appetite, taste smell normal. feel little better morning, coffee allergy medicine helped headache mostly feels like really bad allergies low energy/slight fever. vaccinated Pfizer, boyfriend thinks may COVID. likely? Last year, many us gather holidays.

I doubt year, though. certainly plan family.  correct. confusing question answer direct. Beyond that, peoples issue (not speaking republican politicians, see said, assume ridiculous) hilariously touch statement average person behave.  Updated look table 1 ""unexposed"" group higher incidence ""1 shot"" group makes question power sample size.

At least subtract unexposed rate 2nd shot group get 5.8 - 2.2 = 3.6 per million one would think? Exactly this. People think want, affect them. Like virus cares feelings. take life wants, fucking schedule. insidious. get vaccinated, actively try block people want get vaccinated. scheduling start snd stop date virus?

Fauci said go freely visit family christmas, ""too son tell"" comment reffering pandemic situation would time (number vaccinated, number cases...), wich obvioulsy, since question trying predict future complex situation 2 months, getting ""too soon tell"" response.  40% probably bs, virtually every large scale study indicated 70-95% mRNA vaccines. 

Also, forget, catch post vaccination likely mild.

Mask up, wash hands, live life. ""The best way assure we'll good shape get winter would get people vaccinated,"" Fauci, government's top infectious diseases expert, said Monday CNN. ""That misinterpreted saying can't spend Christmas families, absolutely case. spending Christmas family, **I encourage people, particularly vaccinated people protected, good, normal Christmas family.**""  He's right. people taken precautions prevent things think going stop now. wasn’t misinterpreted. said said. made distinction vaccinated family members families hot zones, would different made distinction all. November, saying message. misinterpreted he's damage control. zero friggin reason family friends can't get together Holidays. 3. adulthood neither negative miserable. 🤷‍♀️ They're pretty cool. Maybe you. issue lockdowns

Over time people stop following Nothing stopped last year, know anyone would think year would different. still pointedly avoid family costs, usual? boggles mind they're afraid vaccine virus. close 20 years since kids diapers, making good decision. younger 2 cloth diapers (and see, they've continued improve since then).

I agree though going good option people washer/dryer whose schedules can't handle multiple extra loads laundry go multiple washes, even afford upfront cost. definitely time investment working, probably would gone disposables.

FWIW, even kids toilet trained, prefold diapers used still came handy almost everything, still kicking around day.

Also, invest Oxiclean; buy truckload. works amazingly well get stains out. :D I’m sure that’s reassuring 😐 😂 look like small study though would digital verification work folks like parents smartphones? Well experience “had get together family important” one people dead (25 preexisting conditions) one longer breathe without oxygen tank (38 preexisting conditions). went saying “I know shouldn’t let’s say hell get together” regret now. I’m saying don’t get together family, smart. Get vaccinated get tested take precautions It’s headlines misinterpreting things. go read original post this. lot top comments misinterpreting complaining Fauci said assume bit wanting make sure people wanted Russian one, bit people countries wanting Russian one (and buying them), bit reflexive anti-Western sentiment. People criticize “messaging”, point, cannot universal message. 

People many unique situations simple guidelines:

Everyone fully vaccinated.
Everyone fully vaccinated, high-risk.

High-risk vaccinated adults unvaccinated adults and/or kids. got COVID summer, months vaccine available him. “Just like flu.”/s exact conversation someone said waiting got fully approved said “It’s actually approved, extended EUA, people really need research.” person went get Covid shortly after. actually Wyoming? probably closer 120% population Wyoming guess. Yes, I'm Melbourne. pointing strategy working, takes one state going rogue basically ruin everyone. case NSW travel bubble NZ that's got introduced there.

Because Melbourne Sydney effectively cut rest country, rest country live relatively normal lives get vaccination rates lot countries managed pandemic late vaccine

A lot countries Pfizer begging sign deal enough doses entire country one first receive it. government interested lining ex-colleague donor pockets best country.

Our PM resorted raiding supplies stockpiles meant needing countries order shore supply worried getting reelected upcoming election. Acute Myocarditis incidence 5.8 cases per 1,000,000 people. 

Per million people? similar study think 250 million males aged around 25 Moderna. That's 1 4000. really ""insanely low"" more. read article instead headlines would know misinterpretation.

Fauci sais vaccinated go visit family, problems all. ""its soon tell"" comment reffering pandemic situation would christmas, people would able see families not. encourages people go see them, whatever pandemic situation is, long vaccinated, arent, recommends take (obviously). Fauci initially saying ""it early tell"" whether Americans avoid gathering holidays (which walked back quickly saying celebrating holidays family Americans too) CDC publishing guidelines holidays included recommending ""virtual celebrations"" (which magically link included guideline got removed quickly sure reports blowback got CDC). We’re getting People still fighting masks. think time subtlety left us back. Actually, same, everyone fine now. seeing family worth it. also know people got covid work, still go work lol. Oh virus definitely changed heart, known cardiovascular effects. 

But cure stupid. It’s confirmed antibodies breast milk, doesn’t necessarily mean lends significant amount protection. You’re right RSV worse.

Fyi, newborn I’m WAY worried RSV. Doesn’t mean I’m vaccinated COVID wear mask. It’s data shows. much time second shot desease? Christmas worry about. heard one. Rasputin vaccine? stunningly amazing look audacity arrogance US think, puny little, indulged, brain ours, schedule start stop date virus. 18 month old baby due November. Everyone required vaccinated im debating asking tests.  possible learn power? Anyone else feel realistically speaking, ceiling US vaccinations around 70% population fully vaxxed? really can’t see getting higher that. Thanksgiving Christmas food gifts safe around wave neighbors

LOL. 

How tone deaf put guidelines expect people fully vaccinated follow them. 

Just LOL. issue comment Fauci made Sunday CBS's ""Face Nation."" Asked host Margaret Brennan ""we gather Christmas, soon tell,"" Fauci replied, ""You know, Margaret, soon tell."" Shockingly decent human make money. takes time FDA review data several thousand trial subjects. FDA it’s statistical analysis. Pfizer hasn’t even submitted everything yet- said started submission.

Hello strangers,

With Love,

Some guy electron tubes. Fingers crossed 5 year olds vaccinated Christmas  Long term side effects tested 1 year, issues far.

&amp;#x200B;

Beyond 1 year, there's always arguements made ""what 2 yrs..."" ""what 4 yrs..."" going do, wait till everyone got vaccinated die old age decide safe? 

&amp;#x200B;

What needs considered instead unrealized risk. risk ""long term side effects"" greater risk COVID greater. doctors public health officials tell COVID risk greater taken vaccine. friend doctor said society ‘opened up’ people *really* celebrating holidays together make last year. 

He colleagues talking we’re gonna extremely lucky don’t completely vaccine-resistant variant February 2022. Sounds like myocarditis swelling/inflammation general, although supposed caused second dose first. Anti-inflammatories might thing, definitely call doctor it.  You’re trying teach lives European country what’s common here? Interesting point. even look age paper? It’s old paper irrelevant. Probably someone searched ivermectin article hasn’t completely discredited fraud? atleast year old. Interesting study would interested research now.    good news?  Yay! miss hybrid telework/office schedule. Can’t wait back it. Can’t take much teleworking time much longer. Heart palpitations neck stiffness (enlarged vein) within weeks first phizer dose? thing? help guess lot embrace it. know different reasons adamant getting vaccinated, I’ve suspected much stubborn afraid wrong. 

If embrace first, one actually forced like people tried vaccines. Sounds like win. /s

Whatever. don’t care. stay hospitals. anti-vaxxer family member mine sent stupid anti-vax image term ""scientism"". demonizing science. Lets say longer talk person. Sounds lot like something 19 anyone know booster shots 12-17 year olds? got second dose June, think booster available 12-17 year olds December? considering booster shots age group? Honestly, 20 minutes agony sounds better months years agony. 

Death comes us all, sucks every time. best thing mental health make peace fact. previous anaphylactic episode injectable scared death getting vaccine. actually started seeing therapist get past fear got done. people like it, anyone can. proud yourself. guess even safest communities health officials want give all-clear we're certain another winter wave happening.  upvoted Covid awareness. time period change observed ""January 6 March 29 2021"" though. pretty early, honestly time many people would initially hesitant vaccines still new tens hundreds thousands time, relatively short time windows them. yeah, there's new vaccine people might need see deployed bunch jumping on, makes sense.

Back Sep 2020 so, planning wait vaccines widely available getting them, case issues arose seeing people/time. Jan 2021, busy trying figure out, far could stretch criteria eligible vaccine order get early. I'm horrendously needle-phobic. vaccine first injection I've almost 30 years. interact plenty needle phobes whi WANT managed get despite fear.  Know could prevented this? I'll let y'all guess time.  also think jump quickly information might even remotely back claims, don’t keep paper gets withdrawn corrected. Many still seem spouting date info start pandemic. can’t include experimental group control group numbers. I’m still looking reliable data.    nurse friend wrong. Anecdotes data. population becomes mosyly vaccinated course higher fraction cases vaccinated people. vaccine reduces chance death around 90%. old, overweight, hypertensive, diabetic etc chances death Covid high. Maybe high 90% combination . get vaccinated still 10% chance dying. reason rates increasing vaccination rates go rate transmission Delta variant high, outpacing vaccination rate. True herd immunity occur least 90% population vaccinated.
70% people get Covid I'll effects, like couple weeks bad flu. 30%...not good. Loss i.q. , impotence, amputation, lung damage, heart damage, neurological problems, diabetes, blindness, death. Awful presume anyone actually reading facts spreading misinformation vaccinated (if actually legitimate reason besides ""I want to""). city bay?  saying author believe science. saying health professionals refuse take basing decisions misinformation. come litany excuses.

To add, legitimate argument getting doses around world quicker that's argument health care professionals making. far good, though dad says she’s really aged lot year. guess it’s race natural aging 4th wave see gets her. ""Surge"" 540,000 people got booster shot today, highest one day total since officially endorsed 65 older.

7.4% 65 older gotten booster shot since August allowed immunocompromised. Reply “MRNA vaccines long term safety data” would persuade players get jab explain benefits described. 

However mean persuade, mean march local walk clinic arm strap chair shit. I'm talking family members friends telling positives vaccine.  live Bay Area it’s gloomy depressing year round. There’s fog, sure. sun comes time.    Good bot Peggysfeet.com  Thank you! People change minds anything. feel like talking difference stated expressed preferences. one thing talk planning do. another risk job defying vaccine requirement perspective: health put it. compendium many different aspects, weight, exercise diet three important aspects. Part issue (regardless quality research) much willing fight back, take good care yourself, look long term view. want immediate gratification, look long term view. populations, similar cohorts end different places bell curve distribution, best can, hope nest possible outcome. IOW, tilt odds favor. Since beginning pandemic, dialed back inter-personal contacts. going two years now, constantly looking new ways pass time ... safely. countries let vaccinated travelers in, don’t required masks.

This way.   ok. government good job past year. Maybe couldve gotten vaccinated faster theyre still control government response light years better country's response corrupt money humanitarian help Using tobacco produce vaccine lungs-attacking virus beautiful. Hope lives hype article.  I'd sure noone NZ believed that. family members friends back home definitely thought that, I'd arguments people inevitability covid seemed pretty sure possible maintain ""covid zero"".

That said though agree points think plan. wish NZ government transparent it. also annoyed Ardern stoked fear rhetoric got high mighty places - recall correctly called reopening UK ""reckless"" claimed would endanger whole planet. Something NZ accept deaths etc. pivot realistic post-vaccination long term strategy plan along, kind talking bollocks previous point. strong enough lose salary. I'm sure agree.

Facebook first social media platform kind. even major social media platform kind today: China Russia competing platforms know of. surprised learn others.

Facebook's predecessor's problems Facebook has. know information indicating contemporary competitors anywhere near scale issues Facebook either, I'm open educated there.

Even different kinds social media platforms, like Reddit, Youtube, Twitter, face anywhere near scale problems Facebook has. That's even though share base problems: address problems far better base business model part around preventing problems festering. Facebook opposite built business around causing expanding problems.

Considering FB's unique position realm ""shittiest social media platform"" historically today, I'm convinced we'd place different platform rising take place never existed. thread OP scare comment open schools lead wave new infections, wave hasn’t materialize likelihood not

You obviously didn’t keep happened Texas opened schools. fact places don’t (and government order cannot) require masks, actively fight vaccine mandates, spread misinformation like wildfire.

Texas still somewhat shit storm Delta variant. that’s problem. sound like we’re fear mongering literally parts world won’t take basic precautions. zero precautions taken that’s virus spread.

In places masking cleaning, they’re fine attend school likely. Studies support that. UNICEF, CDC, many others say that’s fine. follow proper safety guidelines risk transmission exposure minimal. fact though, almost nowhere following guidelines perfectly. begs question: threshold imperfect guidelines? minimum viability safety? That’s isn’t studied least that’s isn’t popular knowledge studied. that’s danger comes trying fight virus that’s statements like *very* dangerous.

People read statements *their* situation mind become lackadaisical *their* situation’s safety guidelines. situation enforcing masks 95% success rates, may see 90% success rate acceptable now, contrast district never can’t mask simply washed hands every time entered classroom, maybe start washing hands every time? it’s “rare” washing hands takes much time. 

While admittedly poor examples, hope help illustrate dangers telling people “hey, rare thing.” there’s three things play here: 1) humans nutritiously bad understanding small probabilities, 2) catch COVID really mess and/or kill you, 3) hospital beds medical personnel taken adults teens refuse get vaccinated. Unfortunately moderating near impossible task, even interested attempting it.

Facebook exists trap people manipulate for-hire. logical endpoint business model. cannot imagine parent shit.  Agree. went college started learning really thinking critically, game changer. world history professor taught class us read important literature written times. stated Epic Gilgamesh. got time Jesus remember one essay options describing Christian Jesus cult leader time… raised Catholic ate loved class much. I’m religious anymore. takes one little question really open mind. I'm one take Covid seriously flu absolutely cause long term effects. Seemingly similar ones seen long Covid, although total loss taste smell seems lot less common.  Inevitable since Delta much transmissible. Plus vaccines eventually look learning live virus. mean short term great policy helped avoid several lockdowns last year long-term elimination possible. Good point. breaks heart soul… can’t anymore  Even though there's yearly flu vaccine, can't wait hear anti-vaxxers claim victory COVID vaccine. Elimination really possible solution long term unless keep border closed forever. Eventually open borders covid enter country since way keep covid forever eliminate worldwide obviously going happen. Plus Delta lockdowns really work well anymore. Although aslong vaccine takeup high due open borders deaths remain low Exactly Ireland, huge surge around Christmas-February highest cases per capita world. outside looking probably seemed like disaster zone yet vast majority people meant lot sitting home. personally know single person even ended hospital heard anyone know mention they've lost anyone. 

Not trying play obvious seriousness covid media sensationalism makes seem like zombie apocalypse times  emailed like 13 years ago first heard Scientology went cult rabbit hole. Im pretty sure asked job… stunned replied.  ""viruses never mutate lethal"" popular idea March 2020.

Too many ""experts"" absolutely confident that.

I think psychological factors like accepting reality painful Internet crowd general every one opinion nobody held responsible spreading nonsense. end? operates idea COVID exterminated. cannot. 

So they're careful what? consigned idea get COVID bother avoiding locking away? You’re smart good planner. heard NBA locking knew get little serious…. went grocery, bought canned goods, sanitizer, soap, pack tp… hoped best left worse I'm convinced that's reason assume incompetence specifically. well could result it. biomed industry spent past ~year focusing producing first vaccines approved. Might smaller company cannot get manufacturing commitment, even things right. Could unknown legal hurdles. Could things thought of. yes, could they're dropping ball. see assume evaluate such.  would close numbers low /s 3. got covid month ago. wife vaxxed obviously 8 year old, 6 year old 16 month old baby aren't. luckily ok it, went hospital though. feel like covid wildcard though seems affect literally everyone differently. can't imagine family feeling right now, especially people actively fighting masks vaccines around them. kids even lasti g damage shit makes mad never era, personality way look humanity people live country forever changed. quite true, children aged 12 offered vaccine, although something actively seek - vaccine school based offered vaccination service visits school.  example ""at will"". cause. 

And would hesitate giving power employers, demonstrated early pandemic willing throw us bus convenient.  article care workers doctors/nurses. think care workers take couple weeks train years.   Study conducted high-risk covid infected, too. assume efficacy higher still healthier patients. Weirdly 13% placebo group suffered imagined side effects... weird. raise wages   living wages?

Name calling doesn’t help anybody living wages Starve people work under-livable wages? ""several"" credit cards, sounds like needs financial planner. judge/prosecutor case like that, think showing cards would fair game determine penalty. got screwed high cost living, see thing needed. bought bunch stupid shit hand... living wages  living wages actually government screwed up. Level 4 dropped due non-compliance; many people breaking lockdown make worth economic pain. Severe lockdowns work populace compliant (unless go China route simply weld everyone houses). government stuck rock hard place; end strict lockdown let Delta spread, keep lockdown let spread anyway punishing people following rules continuing blow hole economy. (I personally think kept place, understand didn't.)

No, real screw-up 18 month head start preparing medical system health infrastructure knew eventually coming, fuck-all busy taking victory laps patting back keeping New Zealand ""Covid free"". 

Well Covid fuckin' ready. raise wages strong religious belief vaccines? see. I'll try then.

OK thinking something tragic unavoidable two different things.    vaccine wife get? stay locked world 2 years+? inevitable open since vax uptick slow due relaxed population comes Covid worry about.    is, they’ll step wise function. Because, generally, it’s sure thing, one regulatory body accept approve it, submitting new regulatory body. 

Nobody wants first one say yes. Oh man. COVID trying speed run unlock Extreme Bioaerosol. That's OP tactic.  Influenza cases - there's actually valid worries there.  
 
First, Influenza cases indeed almost non-existent last winter comparison winters. also means 'the flu' catching coming winter (that's right around corner northern hemisphere course) flu cases may skyrocket overwhelm healthcare providers levels. 
 
Complicating factor goes 'flu shot' partly selected based flu variants dominant... last winter... see problem - flu shot may effective year years. 
 
Nobody cheers deaths course. could see even flu deaths averaged two winters, last coming, basically *postponed* flu wave. 
 
Of course actual numbers known hindsight, we'll wait years come decent approximation final death toll pandemic consequences. It’s one thing decided still get pregnant knowing happening us baby shortly covid hit knowing come- it’s really rough. Must difficult flying many secondary-age children England infection. hate idea people ""working"" somehow chose that? 

Every person know who's work &amp; unemployment got fault own. jobs either let go due COVID closed completely-- nothing return to. 

On top that, many given opportunity stay home safe vs potentially putting yourself/loved ones risk chose stay home safe. That's unreasonable choice global pandemic.

Many also used opportunity evaluate life, vs want do, learn new skills, etc... 

But easier make assumptions &amp; classify every single one people ""lazy"" suppose. Hearing stuff like really makes grateful mom decided retire early teaching. districts same; testing unless they’re showing symptoms. Masks recommended, enforced all. school board meetings insane borderline-blood-lust people requiring masks, districts decided require them. However, new thing. happening many viral diseases decades now, even flu. example, recent study found weeks (can't remember many) 42% covid positive people reported least lingering symptom number 30% flu positive people. hope gets attention deserves percentage higher affects people used to. Solid reminder everyone get vaccinated, should. Protect can't actually legit reasons. Yeah, guess. Biontech Pfizer submit data market authorization, nothing move forward EMA, right? totally sure works, impression manufacturer approach EMA.  They’ll use data CDC/FDA approves vaccine like adult’s vaccine. teach kids grades 2-12, used unaffected wearing masks borders miraculous. Kids great. So, Pfizer went get authorization treat kids younger 12y USA Canada. know anything EU? truly hope NZ avoids worst, think likely going ugly months Delta rips population. minimize damage vaccines, even high levels vaccination seem enough prevent Delta rampage. fair deep cleaning kind COVID version ""Security theater"" since transfers mostly airborne droplets risk touch surface someone directly coughed sneezed touch face without sanitizing.

Seatbelts airbags become required items, vaccines be. lots laws regarding use roads, try protect lives. would expect societal shift towards safety, example wearing masks public indoor spaces, prioritizing ventilation air circulation buildings, significant shift working home sectors (which, coincidentally, also reduce road deaths significantly; done long time ago). wanting take vaccine = thinking medical professionals.

Thanks yes, questions form backdrop critical one (as posted) - basically, interest taking cumulative risks vaccine **not** provide resistance acquiring spreading. everyone gets that, tho. know one truly asymptomatic case. technically tired couple days, never would known tested positive prior that. boyfriend ran gauntlet symptoms tho, unfortunately, luckily recovered sense smell quick.  Gonna copy + paste comment thread saying drug “causes cancer” thing molnupiravir need take drug couple days. daily lives, exposed plenty chemicals mutagenic/carcinogenic potential. Hell, UV rays sun cause DNA mutations. CT scans (which given basically every damn person shows ER US) cause metastatic cancer requires lot mutations (typically occurring/induced long period) occur. we’re talking taking one drug couple days, potential mutagenesis pretty damn negligible unless we’re talking context pregnancy. course. starters, supply limited may guaranteed treatment even really ill. comparison, 4.8 million people died Covid-19. Right that’s getting confused. thought antigen antibody thing. it’s good test set Tuesday. got Moderna. Antibody testing isn’t good telling you’re currently infectious (it takes time produce antibodies, stick around months).

An antigen test need. One targeting spike protein would test false positive you’d recently vaccinated.  that’s look N protein instead.  Instructions N aren’t vaccine, codes spike protein.  you’ve got N protein system infected. (You would get false-positive recently vaccinated whole-virus vaccine like Sinovac, *does* include N protein, probably doesn’t apply you.)

Asking vaccine status probably automatic up-selling.  Pharmacy version “do want fries that?”  sad. poor little boy. look photo I'll keep mind kind, like mother wants everyone remember. people want remind Covid kills small number children, every parent small number children. already severe staffing shortages even quit vaccine mandate, they’d fucked. often overlooked here. stick works; forget carrot One monoclonals uses mouse generated antibody human generated one. theory getting sick covid clarifying. Theoretical covid different able breathe. huge difference risk 30 60, even vaccinated. 

Also, given description, maybe dad really enjoy parties. take risk order something r even really like? Moderna antibody titers also decay geometrically, clear exactly rate. See versus instance. Moderna also generates larger factor initial antibodies. need new dose pfizer number months, number moderna would simply larger.

(Note imply Moderna ""better"". 3.3x dose, means could easily increased total vaccinations dramatically we'd cut planned third dose start. Certainly make strong argument older people getting bigger dose, though.)

In several-years period really unclear vaccination going proceed. absolutely possible third dose rate decay drop stop B cells produced. also possible we'll end something like ""have booster dose within last X months considered fully vaccinated"". entirely clear though protection *after* infection sufficient let protection *against* infection drop indefinitely older people, though.

Me well. 

My friends discussing past tragedies, pockets moments relative peace disconnected going overlooked history books. example, imagine leaving bombed-out East London Blitz 1940 taking short train, let's say half hour long, peaceful little village Oxfordshire war damage whatsoever. 

To use metaphor, feel 'in village' COVID, lucky enough directly affected all, course aware great suffering 'in city'. Vaccination lowers risk compared people age bracket.  covid still disease skews heavily towards serious elderly.  

Very roughly, vaccination takes 30yrs risk profile.  So, vaccinated dad level risk vaccinated.  sounds like cautious got vaccinated. maybe think back you’ll able better understand concern? Ah yes theft okay. countless places help families need inclue providing necessities like diapers. Theft wrong period  feel like that's really low bar ""smart man"". Better science education?

Refusing give Andrew Wakefield medical license?

Never producing Apprentice? shit

also vaccine low key free people ""researchers shocked disgusted discover vaccine negatively affect even long dead, even yet conceived laid low heart destroying serum."" businesses literally closing can't find employees. way past time. Sure, slow suffocation caused lots stuff. It’s uncommon way go. least Covid kills days instead years.  problem never people dying Covid, also Covid patients taking huge amount hospital beds. Italy dealing shortage available care.    foolish Australia. suppressed past variants, current wave happening population vaccinated. Mid-November earliest, approval goes smoothly. Christmas break would looking decent number already vaccinated.

My personal hope, elementary teacher, get 50% fully vaccinated kids March Break. it’s gonna take mandate get people onboard. like regular loss smell/taste. sensation GONE. covered up, diminished, nerves nose transmit. even smell rubbing alcohol. Vaccinated people significantly less likely get infected transmit infected.  

It’s think think though. quarantine rules like country?  many countries outbreak office would mean unvaccinated must quarantine vaccinated test, quarantine shorter period etc.

And individual worker, might considerations, like masks worn? rapid tests used? What’s airflow like (will provide air purifiers)? commute giant crowd people get office?

And whole ‘nother level - voluntary, vote majority rules someone high personal risk forced office young healthy folk vote opening?  workers healthy themselves, live high risk person? said comment, idea us open certain vaccination levels reached. Zero COVID isn’t permanent strategy, people would rather take slowly cautiously enough people vaccinated hospitals aren’t overwhelmed due open up.

If mostly opened Christmas, COVID deaths country stay low, would deem strategy success, I’m quite confident occur. It’s infuriating.  Smart man. Get shot. Make millions. loose money, career, opportunity vaccine help save life.  reaction first shot. 30 minutes second shot, veins arm got shot swelled like weight lifter’s started hurting. swelling went 4 hours later. went primary physician said hit vein. heart palpitations that. also extremely afraid getting shots tendency pass out. took Ativan got done. got booster feel thankful relieved. non issue. get non mRNA vaccine made time tested technology they're afraid newness mRNA. NSW Victoria, well past point breakthrough cases getting 1000+ cases day each. Victoria notably strict lockdowns, states roadmaps towards opening certain vaccination targets reached.

The rest country wants prevent outbreaks occurring states time being, it’s pretty clear us need eventually open up, would rather take slowly cautiously. vaccination rates also still aren’t high states due combination NSW getting larger share supply complacency due living lifestyle pretty similar pre-COVID. remember thinking Italy hit early 2020, like media made seem like end Italy bodies piling streets. seemed like apocalypse. 

Then UK eventually got even worse numbers wasn’t bad thought, made wonder world thought us. 

I realise i’m probably incredibly lucky 18 months later don’t know anyone thats died covid handful people know tested positive. No-one extended family though. made realise big world is, populated statistics misleading. even remote tech worker make unemployment usually add company benifits like healthcare. could world followed China’s zero covid method. one would consent level control though.

New Zealand’s Covid-19 elimination strategy undergoing “transition”, prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said, marking first time government signalled imminent shift away ambitious approach largely kept country free said strict lockdowns end 90% eligible population fully vaccinated. 46% eligible population – 12 years – fully vaccinated, 76% least one dose.

I’m playing devil’s advocate attacking disagreeing pointing things I’ve heard agency rebuttal. Agreed. many times seemed like *had* sort saturation point? couple months later, bam. ""shortly after"" current group best I've seen described. think best December, likely early 2022.  Wiggum, Wiggins. LMFAO  would ask, ""how many small children dieing OK?"" mask mandate.  
Its mandate law place year even expired three days ago, see difference day since many people still wear open public areas. 
It also worded way as: ""you need use mask, possible social distance"", ultimately left decision people (although fined refuse follow certain criteria, usually first warning though). Still locking central coast California want hasten death vaccinated severely health compromised mother. We're likely staying locked next spring unless something dramatically changes. one \*wants\* dead kids, lots people surprisingly fine larger-than-usual numbers dead kids, means lives inconvenienced.  So, whatever amount risk pre-covid commonly agreed upon acceptable amount risk, greater risk necessarily unacceptable. Maybe, maybe not. Seems like J&amp;J least effective booster really amps protection, according recent findings. would hope make J&amp;J booster available everyone got information. know many long term side effects covid?

Get vaccine keep take drug. compare Taiwan provinces China, May outbreak, Taiwan reported COVID deaths (844) province Hubei (where Wuhan is). Taiwan well (and back pretty close zero local transmission), China real success story given it’s much larger country much larger population land borders.  good way remember young man would realize worthwhile endeavor care someone yourself- even people never met. 

And best way show care others point history get vaccinated wear mask fucking proud choosing love hate.    here. weekend siblings families visiting first time almost 2 years. Everyone 12s vaccinated. got big canopy space heaters we're gonna sit outside couple days hang out. Yeah, children especially low risk COVID? matter weighing bad options:

1. minor risk kid complications COVID.
2. Continuing disruption parental availability child development.

I think #2 far worse #1. really useless skewed stat. vaccine great using everyone vaccinated denominator pretty useless. cycle might happen, majority fully vaccinated people aren’t looking case numbers anymore it’s kind irrelevant, they’ve accepted risk potential breakthrough case. Unvaccinated people never cared going want matter what. 

IMO we’ve basically hit social end pandemic people, even ones taken precautions throughout.  like people always forget folks never *quit* jobs, *laid off* *furloughed* longer profitable company pay time.

now time run back job.

right.   can't hurt, brand booster unlikely make significant difference future. wait guidance, that's better guidance.    live Northern VA similar here, masking stores (I feel like 50-75%). that, private spaces, think anyone still avoiding gathering friends family, even people took seriously start. 

I know we're woods, statement feels hopelessly touch. get vaccinated can't around vaccinated people? erodes confidence CDC Fauci. seen family since covid began.

All us fully vaccinated, I'm going see them. Ha vaccine manufacturers kept saying they’re ‘highly effective’ Delta infection instead releasing numbers. Honestly it’s still better nothing wish they’d released numbers instead. almost like like living normal life outweighs 0.00000001 chance dying. ""it's flu""..... keep hearing here. argue overall point making regards delays meetings progress... see Fauci. mean work FDA, can't make things different way job advisor Biden really affect anything. think key difference suddenly banned certain activities (indoor dining, traveling) 2 shots opposed 3, could become 4, etc. Nobody clue happen next. None whatsoever.

That's basically thrust article. Great article btw.

It may people going get spread gotten spread it. wait weeks burn out.

Maybe people would superspreaders done superspreading.


Maybe immunity evading variant. (this seems pretty unlikely)

It seem like lot people left infect. superspreading seems drives spread. everyone superspreader, especially vaccines.

But predicting waves virus always gone poorly. knows it’s going like 2 3 months. thought shit June, Delta hit hospitals overwhelmed. It’s hard imagine wouldn’t safe hang fully vaccinated relatives holidays. anything like TN plain covid denial. problem long one talks long tradition South. *If* two month cycle continues (and I'm sure will), we'll hit bottom around beginning November. cases rise November December, peaking right Christmas.

He's right soon tell. changed better?

Now know majority Americans many areas country don’t care others longer social incentive even pretend so.  think point, everyone going get covid. It’s going like cold. would nice protection least kids would rather wear masks get sick, get quarantined, virtual school. 

It’s anti-masker parents want use children political pawns problem.  pay something free? Agreed. could focus attention energy one day Leukemia asthma kill many many children every year. 

It's amazing distracted serious killers. I've lost family member Leukemia one awful things ever witness. Oh boy, paywall... many states, teachers striking grounds instant termination.

In states, legislature happy privatize education. likely, still good chance we'll see triage priority go younger unvaccinated adults older vaccinated adults. Itll sad subjectively unfair. Thanks. long life, least. can't imagine losing six year-old child. How'd come ""Bennies"" unemployment? want talk BS ... help much think shot 47.7% last season career 44.6% shooter. think vaccine drop shooting percentage 0%? Nobody clue happen next. None whatsoever.

That's basically thrust article. Great article btw. love food, too. Got COVID Thanksgiving last year. getting sense smell taste back now. I’ll tell what, losing made really appreciate sense smell taste. savor smelling air outside fall day now. hygienist kids dentist lost sense smell January 2021. August still dealing everything smelling rancid lost 20 pounds. 9 year old son it. seem bothered. assure (kids) indeed contract (covid) time believe said severity miniscule compared adults poor health old, that's saw eyes. Definitely many im excited see statistics end school year.  I'm even *that* concerned kids. know desperately want vaccination. them, miracle meds take away danger - even totally wrong. would send unaccented child school? people fucking brain dead?? flu literally doubles schools opening think much contagious virus do? infect child hahah  That's I'm asking. mostly support staff, kinda demonstrates article little sensationalized.  “In retreat” = “Maybe taking break kicking asses” people listening advice year, sorry. People giving second holiday season, especially post vaccine. I'm done masks too. say wasn't.

But, I'm happy policy place unvaccinated idiots still walking office. Covid even days sucks, I'd rather avoid it. elaborate bit discussion. risk pretty much anything. Going school, bicycling, driving, swimming... literally nothing 100% safe. accept try minimize helmets, seatbelts, swimming vests, etc.

When came school, people willing take safeguards like wearing masks, distancing, (eventually) get vaccinated. puts kids faculty/staff additional risk schools. 

We still participate activities risk injury/death. point minimize things cause injury/death. Limit activities employe safeguards. people justification ""not many kids die go school"" need put money mouth get record many extra dead kids acceptable amount (beyond typical tragedies/deaths school district might typical year). one says kids sick.

At rally's anti-mask protestors Florida, myth broadcasted screamed passersby. seen/heard eyes. 

While say true, lot people saying particularly vicious untruth, perpetuating inane illogical claims. 

The fact children getting ill dying, particularly places fighting vaccinations masks, deaths preventable. 

Your downvotes well earned. I'm sorry hear unfortunate card kids dealt, compound Covid horrible. wish family best.  I’m mid 20s underlying conditions. fully vaccinated feel apprehension resuming normal life. friends Red Sox games, restaurants, went Orlando last week. 

The “non-normal” thing I’m getting tested go back office week, lot say coworkers traveled recently. 

I believe Gottlieb recently said we’re going enter period people different risk tolerances, agree him. people know fully vaccinated looked breakthrough risks accepted aren’t taking many precautions anymore, know people still nervous breakthroughs aren’t going stores etc. Can't really see one. big bad variants horizon sort transmission monsters Delta is. US we're pretty much back normal, schools open, usual ""wait X! REAL pandemic starts!"" hype pretty much busted. Holiday season could cause swells areas winter weather crappy people cooped indoors, numbers game favors COVID less less time runs on.

There's point there's enough viable hosts left proliferate. Yes, re-infection possible, 100% going see everyone get re-infected 3, 4, 5 times perpetuate cycle. Plenty people made sacrifices. also seem completely missed point almost certainty extremely risk averse yourself. fine recognize feelings reflective population large. ""kids"" 19, 21, 32 thinking family still hurts heart. lot covid patients recently. 

i've heard people IRL, seen reflected local numbers. number patients seeing matching better whatever numbers locality publishing? population-based cohort study 2 392 924 individuals received least 1 dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, acute myocarditis rare, incidence 5.8 cases per 1 million individuals second dose (1 case per 172 414 fully vaccinated individuals). signal increased myocarditis young men warrants vaccinated cohort unique racial ethnic diversity receiving care community hospitals treatment reflective real-world practice.

Yeah, reads like ""you better say now, able gather holidays"" super problematic performative. got concentrate continuing get numbers try jump ahead weeks months say we're going particular time,"" Fauci told ""Face Nation.

It's get data immediately say ""Looks great, vaxxs everyone"".

Just like teachers, takes actual time grade assignment.

And FDA approval normally takes 6+ months, 3 weeks accelerated schedule.  Enough enough   Lack empathy yet another pandemic suffering world.  sample size one need! misinformed anyone dunning Kruger effect it’s thinking unvaccinated simply idiots threat society. recent exhaustive study done vaccination vs. natural immunity Israel showing natural immunity previous infection significantly stronger vaccine, COVID recently, young physically active eat clean pre existing conditions I’m rush get vaccinated now, got COVID airport wearing cloth mask, found cloth masks aren’t effective stopping spread. whole point making everyone test upon entry airport requiring surgical masks properly worn much effective policy, also isn’t ostracizing unvaccinated population denying right travel, strongly support 50 obese get vaccinated along anyone underlying health risks wants personal sense security. don’t think draconian mandates answer. US bind great many healthcare workers willing get vaccinated can’t simply fire all. What’s surprising high number PHDs America refusing vaccine coupled healthcare workers completely debunks notion idiots don’t understand anything related healthcare science passing vaccine. IMO we’ve basically hit social end pandemic people, even ones taken precautions throughout.

so give shit unvaccinated children? 

""These principles, like them... well, others.""

Groucho Marx. uncivil one. Fauci recommends strict safety compliance sake public health:

“Comedically touch”

Fauci relaxes recommendations increase compliance (e.g. don’t wear mask vaccinated):

“They’re sending MiXeD mEsSaGEs”

The truth people make ZERO sacrifices invent whatever excuse convenient justify actions. Also average person doesn’t mental capacity calculate risk something like this. people refuse get vaccinated? simply higher risk tolerance? Bolsonaro? took year find new tech position pandemic - 60 interviews, apparently suck interviewing. Praying child's health. May odds ever favor.    math last statement? Still fence? disgusting human being.  advice, except people really follow #1. Even COVID people still saying ""it's cold/allergies"" without getting checked. even ""just"" cold, stay home.  Spot on. turning deadliest factor pandemic Same.  Also, get lot vacation time, get holidays off... So, couplings vacation time holidays means stretch shit out. We're going give 2 weeks traveling ham cousins see ever odd numbered year ask job going. Everyone know fully vaxxed boosted eligible. I’ll get booster weeks. Kids extended family eligible soon. I’ll avoid indoor dining week Christmas wear N95 door door traveling.

Sorry Fauci, take insane. Also Exactly. point, hell even talking about. It’s cya move. seriously anyone life pretty much normal here,

these seem like conflicting statements Ahh that’s mentality, that’s vaccines goal begin especially COVID’s ! Hell largely soecified vaccines main priority always prevent severe/hospitalizations. 😂 oof definitely does. also can’t spell proof read save life doesn’t help either.  misleading understand them? different things.  ruled ignoring covid produce much worse myocarditis vaccine  Great comment, cracked ""nutritiously bad."" think autocorrect dislikes word notoriously.  shit people choose spend time direct anger on... Oh agree, outside Fenway mask site.   Haha, go jokes. r/nba nephews arrived. Gotcha. see like maybe 25% Cali rn.   Holy shit. first I've read children dying this. needs end. poor poor baby Apparently that’s supply chain issues. don’t enough fall decor stuff putting Christmas stuff even earlier help fill stores  care happening people happened her. lack foresight empathy.

I also found take need social distancing pretty amusing still fence vaccinating.  Cannot confirm. Fellow parent, comment annoyed me. username “No, Disappointment”  got booster Walgreens (made appointment advance) questioned asked confirm underlying conditions people pharmacy. I'm UK, care free point service. gets added onto taxes.  lockdowns strict enough. hate everyone says impossible. really mean we're willing lockdown extreme level China does, reasonable, impossible. Pls get vaccinated &amp; wear mask indoors Gosh wish could. I've got stubborn ones crowd there's like 3 new babies mix year I'm thinking taking family unit Xmas/Yule camping make special Different way, ya know? Same, I'm worried niece, older family babysit her. 2. Maybe that's less exposure right much longer. Mu recorded since January. competing delta. Nothing (yet least). Despite hospitalized twice, almost dying, Collins said still considering wants vaccinated. (???)

This makes sense me. Hopefully use another ICU bed resources still get vaxxed. Another note vaccine side effects:

In almost situations, negative side effects vaccine also side effects getting disease itself, you’re much likely side effects disease vaccine, they’re typically worse. live Raleigh county 70% vaccinated. Aside masks restaurants still curbside only, life completely back normal. Huge concerts events every week ""super spreader"" events whatsoever. Roads full cars. Bars packed. cases dropping.

To read family gatherings still discouraged downright bizarre actually going public. Whoa whoa whoa, follow science, convenient. Unvaccinated people making wait, regardless vaccinated It’s zeros lower hospitalization covid doubt much pressure decrease right away us live far away relatives short outdoor visit plausible. I've already told family coming holidays feel safe amount potential COVID exposure would get crowded airport long plane flight. I'm keeping son school feel like safe go back. lung disease possibly cancer, worth risk. heart breaks parents choice. Yeah messaging safely gather holidays people gathering vaccinated, go. Festivus rest us! suppose people might listen, people fully vacc'd wearing masks public, thusly less need small parties. got mine 3 weeks ago CVS. Made appt online. Checked immune compromised box. questions asked anything got there.  agree that. Anyone watching case numbers still firmly ""way high break protocols"" camp, least right now. knows December.

I understand people resuming normal life right now. Sure vaccinated relax many normal things, every state still ""high risk"" according stats.

But mentally, people definitely finished pandemic. wonder many articles written last two years declaring covid knees nearly defeated.

I hope right time, I'm holding breath. Mandates flu vaccine actually exist hospitals many schools already, fyi.

Just pointing flu exactly harmless either  Yeah messaging “how gather holidays safely” instead “don’t gather holidays” huge majority country normal holidays regardless point agree get ton attention. think sort compilation helps remember them, though.

FYI -- click different article see teachers state: AMLO? Bukele? Let’s take piss now. 

I mean whole point vaccination rollout whole world go back 2019 style normal.

If enough people refusing vaccine point immunity hard achieve (therefore cases rising), people vaccinated shouldn’t suffer others’ choices. thinking thing. messaging almost opposite effect point helps feed typically anti-vax sentiment careful people fearful. see coming think need bit nuanced. I've NFL games wore mask time got car time went back car end game. also went outdoor concert take mask checked vaccine cards attendees. situations felt pretty safe. I'm vaccinated way. 

Visiting grandma might mean staying house entire week everyone else coming around country hanging living room half people vaccinated. saying could see bit dangerous depending people's vaccination status. does, also politician look everybody's safety. even worry morons refuse vaccine. can't make statement knowing 30% country trouble. Sadly point CDC giving good guidance us right thing. Public health messaging jumped shark May. Fauci Walensky saying “It’s gonna another Zoom Christmas. You’ll together next year!” would make people laugh. mind boggling - still needs think vaccine ? exactly going discover more? Just…what?? I'm going wonder loud I'm lazy google right now. might even intractable searching.

If already infected, get vaccine ASAP, would better wait month longer, treat vaccine booster?  sure meant for…are asking kids lunch mature? person learning important life. One dead child one many wasn’t vaccine last year. vaccine now. You’re acting like difference 2020 2021. tell covid Christmas?   Kemp kills again! talking comment fauci’s? Pity die. Would impacted immediate circle far harder made decide get vaxxed. they'll think oh survived can't bad

I sick tired chaotic stupid people dragging pandemic  can’t see Grandma Grandpa Big Tony says so

Wait, what? [Fauci said 

All y’all making everything confusing making stuff; isn’t helpful. MARGARET BRENNAN: people need start looking around saying risky gather family members unvaccinated DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, believe way CDC recommended situation dynamic virus community, there's clearly lot spread, even vaccinated indoor setting, congregate setting, makes sense wear mask avoid high risk situations. look ventilation indoor places. know clearly spread aerosol, something spread aerosol, absolutely want ventilation, reason outdoors always much safer indoors. indoors, ventilation going key. that's reason really paying attention MARGARET BRENNAN: gather Christmas, soon DR. FAUCI: know, MARGARET, soon tell. We've got concentrating continuing get numbers try jump ahead weeks months say we're going particular time. Let's focus like laser continuing get those- cases down. people getting vaccinated also situation boosters appropriate get people boosted know help greatly diminishing infection diminishing advanced disease, kinds data accumulating real time. Couldn’t say got Pfizer begin forgot bring card in?  none children age child article...  flu kills people too. precautions would also help reduce flu deaths. Less death good last time checked. Alright dude... right, I'm wrong. still get source whole thing good number PhDs doctors anti vax? disease taught human brain deals crises badly human pack animal instinct still stronger critical thinking skills developed modern educational information systems. 
For thousands years, pack stayed safe emulating around us listening leader. People would rather trust belief pack even risk physical death rather leave risk social death. gotten flu shot year yet, complaint employers. 3-dose series provides long-term immunity, require more. immunity inherently fades 3rd, would time since last shot, number shots, would matter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once vaccination rates high enough virus rare enough, places probably drop requirements. midst pandemic, vaccine requirements important unless want close activities everyone. Center Universe syndrome US confirmed cases 10% people likely many asymptomatic untested. anti-vaxx coworker shared argument morning. said CBS News reporting vaccinated deaths almost level unvaccinated deaths. can't find CBS News's site (national local), like u/Stumposaurus_Rex said, anti-vaxx types cling whatever argument supports idiocy. Exactly. vaccine works. numbers show it. figure masks things like Hollidays air. really wish fauci would call antivaxers morons. middle ground stuff gives antivaxers ammo   Resource Officers"" cops, right?

Yes. billions doses given, relative handful meaningful side effects...yeah, that's effectively zero risk. USA, yet allowed, though people done it. Truthfully low risk get person administering dose trouble (theoretically) shows ignored previously. 

The FDA meeting Oct. 14-15 includes portion discuss mixing/matching boosters across manufacturers. likely recommend/not recommend mixing manufacturers meeting. think “northerners living outside” thing bit myth. Chicago August around 90 degrees every day pretty oppressive humidity. Outdoor dining definitely option 1’d it’s great used expand dining capacity, summer definitely isn’t outdoor living, still plenty opportunity indoor spread.

That said, indoor holiday season could increase spread, especially amongst unvaccinated families. friends family fully vaccinated we've still careful going out, we're going see holidays. never stopped seeing immediate family. parents old going live forever. Even prior vaccine, worth seeing around holidays. careful, wore masks, got tested even cold. they’ve tested multiple variant specific vaccines turns original vax works fine delta, think booster would trick understanding. cost perspective, there’s big difference, would rather produce OG vaccine give boosters increase number neutralizing antibodies needs research appropriate schooling certifications vaccine research going take while.

Unless takes shortcut reads wonderful book ""How research die like medieval peasant"" smh Yes, actually. happy pre teen exact. sole reason miserable. anybody else. product (most likely poor) decisions. main point seemingly changed again. can’t happen there’s core group looking reason get shots. Yeah, position makes sense. 

""The suffering others irrelevant, suffering suddenly meaningful relevant.""  Covid doesn’t care year is. even slammed covid patients right ICU last year that’s possible. Double bunking rooms, boarding patients ED , it’s absolutely horrid. Surgical masks much effective cloth ones said put least, required FFP2 masks high population would shortages. would unintended economic consequences pissed public. horse buggy vs seatbelt comparison laughable, seatbelt doesn’t require inject substance body isn’t required anything operating motor vehicle. You’re denied access society pay cause didn’t wear seatbelt nonsense comparison reason one takes experts seriously anymore. comment like hilariously touch reality. commenter said Portugal big spike beginning 2021.

However understated still. wasnt bad, one worst surges world saw, proportionally ofc, outright worst. absolute peak daily new cases hit 16k day. perspective would USA 520k new cases day, surpassing 220k US record.

A massive shutdown soon followed people stuck home, news treated terrifying imagery utterly overrun emergency units. 

Unlike US people start deluding wasnt real even outside hospitals long lines ambulances formed country

The lockdown lasted months, situation probably big reason top chart vaccination rate. I'm sure vice admiral best lot stumbles process, like magical special Portuguese variable. Another relevant factor Portuguese trust institutions , political leaders, nationalized Healthcare, etc

Make mistake though, huge surge result Portuguese governments lack action winter holidays, something conveniently forgotten since You’re 100% correct. ‘em don’t clue Fauci actually said. It’s frustrating af. 

Here’s said, btw, anybody actually interested: DR. FAUCI: that's one thing want make sure viewers realize we've done well sense getting 55% population fully vaccinated 64% least one dose. we've got keep pushing vaccination MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. said, ""Don't let guard down."" two new studies show COVID's gotten better transmitting aerosols, air. mean? We're going cold weather. We're going holidays. people need start looking around saying risky gather family members unvaccinated DR.

I’m resigned getting Covid point I’d rather wait vaccines, testing ability, treatments make safe possible. I’d also like local hospitals one ER bed available lots well-rested doctors nurses ready devote lots time need it.  article states pediatric version vaccine delivered Canada new year, getting mid-November timeline? hope available soon, I'm worrying child getting seriously ill dying stupid pandemic. needed. current vaccines still highly effective Delta. 

The issues seen far potential decline immunity 65+ immunocompromised. don’t know. make choices life. wouldn’t expect anyone feel bad brainwashed cult side effects third dose Pfizer basically nothing. flu shot. Would interesting see trial lower doses 4th+ doses. spends month hospital almost dies still needs “do research” decide wants get vaccinated?! WTF? India seems severely counting covid deaths. loads articles ago.  scary. son sick covid two weeks now. seeing doctor today. seven. Everyone assumes kids fine son rough go I'm betting super nervous dragging out. homeschooled last year fell behind reading enrolled public school wore kn95 everyday. I'm assuming caught lunch.    thing city Detroit. Detroit proper pretty small population. Metro Detroit big one. Sounds good. Hope wages go though, account differences job / education levels sustain buying power wages face inevitable inflation. Flawless logic, salute you. taking quick glance, think official numbers India looking people access hospital care. leads massive undercounting. 

[This put pandemic death toll India 4 million. (India roughly 4x many people US). MRNA vaccines first coming out, said could re-tooled within days week 2. Moderna Pfizer put Delta tailored one? Different. 3 doses Pfizer safer effective 2 doses Moderna, would call Moderna worse? ""Data shown"" really evidence see methodology. easily get wrong answer trying measure vaccine effectiveness outside randomized, controlled trial. That's vaccination campaigns countries prioritize people age also occupational exposure risk, also high risk settings like institutional living facilities (elders living elderly care, etc. vs. living independently). use yes/no model vaccination, one discredited study Israel concluded similar low effectiveness Pfizer vaccine, easily failing account age-related effectiveness also completely fail account occupational risk situational risk. Higher risk people also know social activity contact people, try get vaccine first. Furthermore, people naturally use vaccination end goal resuming social behaviors, increasing risk. easy see dramatically populational risk vaccinated unvaccinated randomization involved. want able get booster without lying health Reddit asking ""What thoughts?"" thought - wish western countries compensate least low income families respectable amount like $5k/$10k. hard loose someone family!  sure conflicting statement. live NY 4 month point entire neighborhood felt like abandoned city vehicles saw city buses. can't go indefinitely. living time mask mandates gone, businesses reopened, vaccine mandates put place. Thus, still taking pandemic seriously. Same. I’d rather get Moderna fairness, numbers one specific country necessarily would perform countries. That's fine highlights suck messaging. literally said average people care worried about.    It’s 2020 anymore. don’t see big deal especially everyone vaccinated recovered? swear like 40% Americans think like actual toddlers small children. They’re much testing (over 20,000 tests day) last outbreak, yet local cases. last death last month. least basic Google search type nonsense. Look, everyone vaccinated it’s pretty safe. Even case happens probably going ok. Curious flu shots twice year. probably would everywhere flu seasonal, people worry summer flu.  Okay enjoy 1-5% probability serious illness every year. Seems fine realize gotta get lucky every year, math. Clearly that’s good enough don’t really much say. payer (in case NHS) would likely happy pay $700 pills avoid $7000 (much) case ICU care several weeks. Obviously (and us) would happier pay $70 pills competition price hospitalization Maybe cult leaders, surely sympathy brainwashed individual? literally know better. whatyearisit.jpg remember wet dream “you lockdown wrong it’s possible eliminate virus r 8”. 
Everyone incompetent Australia New Zealand lord disinformation strong. needs research it

Obtaining appropriate schooling certifications vaccine research going take research focuses biochemistry physical properties disease-causing microbes use cause damage host. research also considers biophysical characteristics microbes might used vaccines drugs prevent interrupt disease process. part vaccine development cycle called basic preclinical scientist doctorate degree cellular molecular biology, biochemistry, microbiology leads studies; however, wide range research functions carried research assistants might require BS degree fields. case vaccine development research, research associate jobs might involve growing cell lines culture (a cell line clone group clones grown culture derived single cell proliferate indefinitely strict lab conditions), cloning DNA, performing assays (lab tests look for, quantify, measure activity proteins, viruses, DNA). Basic research jobs might also offer opportunities become expert operating specialized laboratory equipment flow cytometers use lasers evaluate basic research requires data analysis stage, represents yet another field expertise: data management analysis. jobs usually require BS necessarily advanced universities allow students volunteer paid small stipend work lab—this provides valuable training excellent experience getting job graduation. student jobs range technician assistant, student may required prepare chemical stock solutions, wash, sterilize glassware, care research animals, senior technician, maintains cell line stocks, tracks breeds research animals, orders laboratory supplies, may conduct vaccine looks like serious candidate therapeutic use, project team moves development phase, scale-up development phase. development, scientists, advanced degrees manufacturing engineering, assistants work best methods producing vaccine large scale. Again, PhD level scientist typically heads experiments, numerous jobs individuals BS degrees Fauci basically every one professionals risk tolerance wildly lower average people

Because care everyone focusing spread instead individual impact. Average people calculating personal risk tolerance, caring spread. quite literally comedically touch.

What? No, serious, important job affects hundreds millions people, nobody whose opinions affect virtually nobody. shit. Live state pays $7.25/hour. Connecticut it’s $12/hour stores offering hiring bonuses everywhere. Or, maybe vote someone Congress supports $15 minimum wage. reason migrate digital verification point - various frameworks developed utilize today. know mandates helping push vaccine uptake, giving anti-vaxxers space abuse rights what's dragging recovery efforts. Implement digital passes EU majority Asia call day. know cases deaths nearly exclusively attributed unvaccinated.

Stop pretending like vaccine exist. Alright missed one. basically everything done avoid something proven benefits. One also avoid seat belt mandate using horse carriage see valid argument. btw, keep bringing ineffectiveness cloth masks, true guys still use surgical masks unacceptable Germany quite now. FFP2 masks allowed surgical ones good enough. yeah, masks solution either. Yeah literally one listening anymore

You wrong that. vaccinated, he's always saying see family, saying anything hasn't? Maybe listening? Facebook people. understand it, whether vaxxed not, unvaccinated vaccinated equally carry it, transmit aquire it.  correct?

That incorrect, though clearly explained lot media, understandable would misunderstanding. Vaccines protect even infection COVID 50-95% time. actual statement given COVID, peak contagious unvaccinated vaccinated.

The first thing understand \*given COVID\*. Vaccinated people several times less likely get infected, several times less likely spread it. such, example would unlikely second office would probably fewer people COVID it. 5 still possible, already scenario vaccine performed well average.

The second thing understand even example, second office far fewer people contract COVID. Even 5 people spread COVID equally, second office much protection contracting COVID 5 infected people.

The one caveat vaccines seem losing protection infection time, protection hospitalization death stable, boosters important. likely body two different defense mechanisms: antibodies, shorter term faster responsible protection cases spread, B cells, longer term slower responsible protection hospitalization death.

The third thing understand even COVID, vaccinated might still mean less likely spread it. peak amount virus appears same, quite possible peak shorter time. good understanding effect though, think still researched.

However, overall thing realize even vaccine protects infection 50% time, that's 50% less chance someone catching COVID someone spreading someone vaccinated. Eventually high enough levels vaccination creates called herd immunity, even though breakthrough happens every then, breakthrough able lead explosion cases stay isolated people. Unfortunately, CDC FDA decided cases spread matter responsible causing significant confusion around massive benefits vaccines relating reduction cases spread indirectly translate reductions hospitalizations deaths. Archer joke bud  numbers NZ speaks itself. Sorry.  attitude. describe dropping plan, end game always get many people vaxxed open vaxxed people lock hospitals become overwhelmed. 


No one NZ believed would remain covid free perpetuity. stuffed vaccine roll ended another strict lockdown. vaccine readily available borders open soon. Sad lovely angel.

I tested positive 2 months ago still body aches, rare fevers, taste smell odd. wish would let lose pounds, aside 5 day period consumed nothing water, nothing.

That worst. done, guess gobbled enough food stay roughly been.

It weird thing. experience it, likely cannot imagine it. know explain all. let kids swim zero swim safety precautions, yeah, bad parent. Come US get shit together, like talk though im alberta, US Canada. countries done VN NZ did, sure. we’re way past point now. Thanos would say:

Delta inevitable. Poor boy, sweet smile G'damn it. makes angry.  Florida?   I'm still trying figure deal moisture accumulates masks fall-winter keep breathing steam it. know letting air dry bring back electrostatic charge before. last year used blow dryer recharge mask, pretty tedious. sill wont fix wet mask problem outside. 

PS wear outside distance apartment metro station metro station work short.  RIP. parent bury young child. Back started getting bunch free money? Well that’s vaccinated still spread virus. Hence mandated international flights etc. Novavax currently trialing combo flu+covid vaccine. course nobody trust companies competence. hero. do, unlike many anti-vaxx tough guys, spite deep-seated real phobia. Know awesome. June, American Medical Association reported 96% American physicians vaccinated. 

Granted, self reporting study, physician acceptance rates vaccine seem high. docs state protease inhibitor.

The couple drugs can’t speak also protease inhibitors.

Imagine that.  Agreed.

I travel extensively (for work time personal work), longer traveling cities countries mask mandates, unless it’s really big job. It’s difficult infuriating. I’m particularly supporting countries let vaccinated travelers in, don’t required masks.  none mention Covid hospitalizations, least MA, 3% total capacity. Hospitals full people catching procedures shut restrictions. quoting wikipedia, masks come off: ""when sufficient percentage population become immune infection, whether vaccination previous infections, thereby reducing likelihood infection individuals lack immunity."" No, avoid it. tamiflu cause cancer it’s different? BS. Cases falling majority New England states, even weather beginning cool. course can. 20 % likely catch half likely transmit do. addition, whatever risk dying virus vaccine reduces 95% plus, reduces chances long term complications symptoms almost 100%. deaths UK 2021 99% unvaccinated. fucks sake grow up. want see breakdown many doctors vs nurses compliance. sister became RN 2 years time all, doctors go school triple time. 
How many 10 years+ folks walking away? really love fact people political spectrum put aside differences agree hate Zuckerberg.  Political? ever talking dear? something Fauci explicitly stated article like said, I’m anxiously awaiting decision matter Misleading article. 

*""In Connecticut, Legislature extended governor’s emergency powers make easier cope latest wave pandemic.""*

This bullshit. positivity rate CT lowest long time. extended governor's emergency powers *in case another wave*. Right now, there's ***not***. natural people

Also news determine potential cases Nah... I’m autistic &amp; extreme needle phobia - trust me, vaccinated fuck. literally got xanax script get vax.  Wow understanding, McDonald's test phase using automation. Pretty sure getting ready deal lack employees. 
Manual labor slowly surely becoming thing past. still avoid self checkout 1. I'm getting discount use, 2. time being, keep someone employed, 3. use it, still needed help checkout dumb needle super tiny even hurt Facts, something unfamiliar. wife doctor, sister nurse, husband. Six wife's colleagues died Covid last year. None 50. brother law looks staff welfare one largest NHS areas. 40 % frontline staff breakdown last 18 months. One effects Covid clotting. lead necrosis amputations. Many Covid patients amputations. rate type 1 diabetes UK doubled since Covid. vaccine, course without risk, bit risk approximately 1000 times smaller risk contracting Covid. Unfortunately brain dead attitudes like endanger yourself, also everyone else. evil. they've done research! facebook memes youtube videos! best prevalence estimates based PCR tests randomly selected nationally representative sample, correct. I'm referring people self report COVID, example coughs come many sources moment natural people jump conclusion COVID, many areas testing always available prove either way (or people it)  One theory antivaxxers mostly people scared needles trying give reason get shot. still spread even herd immunity. 
When masks come off? news “insane people continue say insane things.” 

By saying insane using clinical definition. colloquially using word insult uncivil. sounds like Redditor.  Ya. feel like HR jumping joy likely problem employees already. 

Now know stealing lunch work fridge. read summary approval process Sputnik V vaccines  sure. guess tired reporting Getting vaccine never end game. Herd immunity end game. Since reached that, vaccinated still get spread COVID, masks still thing.

Ireland lifted restrictions around Christmas last year allow people congregate. Afterwards, Lockdown spring. Taiwan 800+ deaths last outbreak. wide testing, least lot asymptomatic infected recorded.

TIA feels touch read things like this. 

I live New England we’ve taken pandemic seriously anyone life pretty much normal here, even stores don’t see 20% people masks anymore. full capacity sports games, packed bars restaurants etc. one avoiding gatherings. 

In personal life know 2 families still avoiding going places, that’s young kids home. Everyone else know, even people young kids, basically back normal lives.   don't. mean, mostly friends yannow. Probably going put another statement people fully vaccinated avoid gatherings adn know group good listening CDC's recommendations.  FDA can’t bothered meet vax approval sense urgency Fauci press tours, perhaps go help find sense urgency he’s pressing American populace. 

Not denying COVID big deal entire family vaxxed. don’t see level effort urgency FDA.

However, I'm glad we've low case/deaths covid general numbers read US/Europe horrendous.   Curious hadn’t fired long ago taking required vaccines. What???? I'm Wake County, know this, frustrating! love Gramma  take infected reduce viral replication thus severity length infection. somewhat similar Remdesivir prodrugs form nucleoside analogs. Remdesivir given intravenously seems operate halting viral RNA replication.

Molnupiravir given orally incorporates replicating RNA causes errors (mutations) successive replications. Errors accumulate resulting sequence longer viable. Mina put together chart based data UK's Public Health Good idea. It’s tough loved ones, especially parents, able around you’re sick. Definitely keep close eye O2 levels. Covid sneaky capricious virus. Good wishes hope feel better soon.   parents going Christmas party year they’re going invited vaxxed people. they’re older (60’s) I’m 30 think that’s bit overboard. mean ever since vaccinated back spring, whatever dad Ubër cautious. 

I’m like what’s point vaccinated aren’t going anything. can’t live bubble. think dad using Covid excuse antisocial. Idk One big takeaways author vulnerable cults. People often believe differentiate group passionate cause cult, lines extremely blurry. important us remain vigilant skeptical information consume continue objective possible ensure values behaviors line one another. think people never allowed go sports events again? comment, least me, implied Russia wants explicitly win, comment says Russia care winning; emphasis Team winning vs. Team B losing.

Your comment still valid, though. admit comment necessary, thought it'd interesting, slightly different angle yours. lost ability taste. horrible!! I, also, love food brings much joy. Sad days... Pretty sure using regular 100 microgram one since smaller dosage approved EMA yet. country Austria way.

I ready go Moderna anyway stumbled upon news government Ontario recommended young men. probably choose Pfizer instead wait weeks data (hopefully) released Van der Waals forces fundamental part matter interaction. might wear heat death Universe. Getting booster hours. even give flu shot time! save trip 😁 love warm lemon Gatorade drank ton covid What? feel like journalism days marketing anything. Unbiased, agenda neutral reporting rare beast days!! vaccine incredibly cost effective well. Treatment get sick exponentially expensive.  good argument refute Scott Gottlieb’s prediction last major wave? Agreed. meant it’s going common like cold. 

I hope gets approval soon kids Confucius, believe. also done night, delivered hospitals morning due shelf life. operate facilities un-marked buildings, delivered un-marked vans reduce public freak-out. meaningful ways, Northeast reaping reward good behavior. live NYC since pandemic began, I've traveled leisure New England (cabins woods part).

NE better mask compliance NYC height pandemic. vaccinated numbers among best nation. stuck guns social distancing, masks, vaccines, pretty much get live life normally (WHILE ALSO SAFE, FLORIDA).

The rest country keep waiting people get heads asses, guess. difference folks like me, flu shot makes feel little off. Whereas COVID shot makes temp skyrocket 103-104. Yes fever lasts day temps consequences body. I'm fully vaxxed getting booster anytime soon without changes it. Especially 8 died placebo group. Study stopped well performed. $700 course pills steep, price needs knocking down. Yes, want mitigate catching covid19 much can. immunocompromised loved ones close it’s important don’t risk them. 

I wear n95 even outside walks live downtown near heavy tourist area. here, made like two weeks school. Honestly follow every precaution, also think people bar set way high expectations able avoid virus. Yes we, though? feel like nobody’s really paying attention. live New Jersey, sounds like reasonable rule me.  Everything presented correct, but, better present numbers rates within vaccinated unvaccinated communities- vaccination rates start climb high, might need counter argument goes like this: ""most patients hospital vaccinated"" (as case Israel last month).

In Georgia, 34,770 hospitilizations within unvaccinated community 5,807,936. 2,118 hospitilizations within fully vaccinated community 4,902,081. rate hospitilizations vaccinated community 43 per 100k. unvaccinated 599 per 100k. rate serious illness 13 times higher unvaccinated group! going like cold vaccine. That's whole point vaccine. 100% stop spread even keep getting it, lessen impact something really non-worrying all. That's need kids vaccinated too, never comes this. Oops! Completely forgot Georgia also state USA...

The comment missing data point still stands, though assume area rely Romanian vaccine donations... Check article linked. can’t. Lightning strike clear day 75 miles away. Yes things prevent lightning strikes thunderstorm, random lightning strikes like that, cannot prevent. mean sort ridiculous point bad messaging is. 70k people Gillette stadium last night ""maybe see family Christmas?"" really matter recommends, people going 2019-esque Christmas gatherings year. anti-vaxx give shit begin with, rest us tired penalized people even bare minimum. Sorry loss. sometimes good joke needed. making pun. laughing death/illness Might want read [the actual study article talking CDC CDC saying **What implications public health Mask requirements teachers staff members improved ventilation important strategies addition vaccination teachers staff members elementary schools could implement part multicomponent approach provide safer, in-person learning environments.

The validity masks never put question study. anything, study showed improved ventilation incredibly useful.

Additionally, article confusing “A year ago, said, ‘Masks end world; wear mask?’” Elissa Schechter-Perkins, director Emergency Medicine Infectious Disease Management Boston Medical Center, told me. “But world changed, real downsides masking children long, known end date, without clear upside.” continued, “I’m aware studies show conclusively kids wearing masks schools effect morbidity mortality hospitalization death rate community around them.”

This individual asks evidence masks, yet doesn’t quote evidence detrimental effects masking kids long? I’ve heard negative effects masking.

This article littered examples like this. Cherry-picked quotes support claim without properly considering what’s said. I'm reading EMA approved third dose (Pfizer) **all** 18s 6 months past second dose. immunocompromised least 28 days past 2nd.

Great news suppose, surely better messaging FDA.

Also personally trust EMA includes suburbs, city limits  chronic cough 2 years later getting ""just flu"" maybe downplaying much either..... realistic comes covid everyone else got vaxxed. Agreed probably won’t help, would rather say? y’all dumbshits knock out? Maybe lots people deserve message, hospital workers regions don’t. He’s professional scientist still needs give best advice can. logic there’s need hate antivaxxers since costs taking vaccine would largely privatized little externalities (except cases ICUs filled). experiences somewhat different, live suburban city outside Boston, want say 95% time go supermarket/corner store/take-out, etc., people masked up. 
You tend tolerant non-masked folks surrounded people most-likely vaccinated like yourself.

Gonna need sauce hot take. Know many died polio? Zero. they're vaccinated it.  Dude parents like start cost months life (long covid). changed outlook bit still shake plethora propaganda fed. know demographic fucking idiots see rallies internet. sad idiots beyond little demographic sad truth. I've met manyyyy people mindset throughout (I live Germany), here's absolute shocker, none even remotely knowledgeable field science, yet confidence truly correlates Dunning-Krüger effect. yeah, assume fewer people get boosters time, means we're nothing. First whole lockdown/social distancing stuff, vaccines... Makes sense already behind rest world many years trend continue? vaccinated? look like this: thing vaccinated point. patience worn thin, responsible vaccinated, something worry about. 
This blanket guidelines, less know risks (like say, live FL vs VT example) get young kids, again, people know kids 12, 2 still keeping kids home. 99% people know unvaccinated kids living lives normally, don’t even think kids still aren’t vaccinated going keep people gathering holidays. 

I Universal amount kids saw 12 insane, seems lot parents even accepted risk covid unvaccinated kids. I’m uk it’s jobseekers chap woman get sacked That’s dumb headline then. Immediate distraction what’s hand wanted intensify topic (not say attention isn’t deserved obviously) It’s soon decorations appearing stores too.  So... skipping thanksgiving together? Underlying conditions. Poor family - risk kids need vaccine. also wasnt vaccine last winter  traveled seen family last holiday. mistake to. 


Now we're vaccinated, I'll going back sure. may covid

*Interesting* course does! 🤣 form social media tries maximize user engagement eventually run problems facebook has. social media ad-driven attempt maximize user engagement.

Right now, twitter almost bad facebook. Reddit also heading direction [most recent changes ""best"" Honestly, 2021 COVID vaccine absolute best birthday present could give child.   PCR tests? change flair Canada OP. type advice ""knowing more"". risk tolerance. Fauci basically every one professionals risk tolerance wildly lower average people. devoted lives keeping population healthy. Way people devoted lives drinking twelve beers eating four sausages football party Saturdays Sundays. Like things great health like people live. understanding basic fact leaders like Fauci done shit job messaging. comedically touch. Last year someone tried pulling 0.1% risk death kids caught COVID ok it, get kids back school goddamit they're driving crazy months lockdown working home!

(We know UK study like 2 million, argument time used much smaller denominator).

I asked ok one *his* kids 1 1000 died. never replied.   Same, literally. actually put IEP can't considered truant punished absent, kept giving us crap. Like, what, doctors notes enough?

And instead spending last 18 months figuring make schools better, everyone buried heads sand said ""we need go back normal"". Well, welcome normal, kids medical problems never accommodated. Thank you, appreciate that. strange going house sort everything. year yet, lack will, we're still deal estate courts. hard mentally deal loss, I'm quite sure could function lost one kids. can't wrap head around that. That’s true. Well available positive people vaccine  northeast, DC Maine, different category. We’ve taken pandemic seriously whole time, current danger level reflects that. parts country say thing. Fauci talking everybody else.  waiting decision Spain, think +65 get boosters, know recommend anyone else   poll, another factor persuasive full approval: Fear -- fear dying Covid-19 missing activities travel, concerts sporting events require vaccination.

Yes, FDA Approval was, *de facto*, green light vaccine requirements way EUA not.

I'm sure treat independent declare ""Full approval modest impact vaccine uptake"".

(I still would argued broader EUA mandates legal moral, that's mostly moot now).    one nice pithy quotes that's going harm good taking context.    I'm hopeful J&amp;Jer I'll allowed mix/match get one mRNA vaccines booster. Eagerly waiting see said 10/15 meeting addressed. you’re vaccinated, definitely go see parents

The one caveat mode transportation require. get car? Definitely go. pack airports airplanes people headed family gatherings? major contributor horrible spike last winter. prompted answer, directly dictate it. point says, ""yes, announce right Christmas gatherings good idea, safe,"" he'd disservice. groups many unvaccinated, would good idea large gathering. expect answer this? people thread like, whole family vaccinated, saying can't get together the. 
He talking people situation. answering towards population whole, best say things would dissuade people getting vaccine.  Well know old saying, may covid, covid ;p.  Fenway super high visibility area, that's terribly surprising indoor bars holding letter mandate. However stepping places city see different story. went 4 different bars/clubs course weekend, door masks gone completely, whether actively drinking, seated, milling people. 

It's much become safety theater keep mayor happy squeamish people satisfied something done. Thanks reply. Honestly people different preferences feel productive. I’m home; least home time. need change scenery every awhile (hence, support hybrid schedule). organization variety flexible working schedules. point option unavailable going office. understand safety precautions however miss 2 days go office. broke monotony workweek. don’t like work space totally intertwined house. 

Haven’t heard anything increased productivity organization (but I’m lowly Gs-12). honestly I’ve fucked around telework ever have. don’t feel productive going office. 

I totally get I’m minority.   Doesnt matter not, anyway another covid wave.  Millions people still listening professionals. certainly knows you. Well, pregnant coworker really waiting approval.

Problem is, caught COVID right approved.

She’s fine now, gonna get 3 months recovery, definitely wake call her. it’s like, difference waiting make except put risk, especially many people gotten fine?!  Sounds like coming 2020/2021 better mental shape am. Power you. Oh no. Anyway.  wish US would require cover costs flu transmissable illnesses retail workers. Illness really hit places. least need require Covid shots. We've outbreak outbreak work. think people realize many retail workers go work sick. show Covid, breathe hundreds people day. TIL Boston 684,000 residents. Alabama? What? One local anti-vaxxers - wrongly - claims ""Comirnaty"" fully approved, certain non-US countries, ""Pfizer"" remains entirely experimental. go claim - also wrongly - 2 entirely different formulations.

Our anti-vax neighbor refuses provide source. Maybe they're tired getting laughed at? (A shame, really. ways one. useful know s*it comes from.)

I responded article FDA naming protocols regards Pfizer/Comirnaty. fairly easy read. Pretty sure convince them, shut falsehood. venue, anyway.

Here still large public events yet,

Why not? vaccinated, live life. designed way coasts rule land w/o flyover states say, guess. USA, qualify, went got first time. I'm going trip soon unvaccinated part world (obviously considered going chose proceed, feel free shame me) want everything lower chances super-spreader guy. high exposure day-to-day part job anyway, seemed like smart thing do.

In case there's confusion, fourth mean second dose second vaccine. ok great  
may ask dumb question 
 booster shot exactly makeup 2 shot. (I mean like getting 3rd shot mRNA) know, full moderna dose getting first shot? partial dose? true look well worked last fall/winter. hope year massive improvement, though, since truly better armed. Since hardly anyone family vaccinated, sitting season again. hope make okay.  can’t wish bad luck terms health anyone, say reap sow without remorse. time take Fauci air IMO. basic PR, guy disliked half country, he's guy going TV advocating things. sure mean “against”

So, nothing holiday traveling seeing family? Especially you’re fully vaxed? family really great job gathering Christmas Easter last year proud them. week two vaccines started offered everyone threw big party face palmed fucking hard. Nobody got sick like damn, talking giving finish line.  700K reported deaths covid... Uhoh lots posts incoming communism etc around this...watch. wife due day first baby. Luckily decided long time ago cloth diapers ton effect us. Honestly, awful diapers environment, probably net positive people using less maybe people board going cloth diapers. 

My main concern would lower income families. Cloth diapers cost plastic factor everything in. upfront cost pretty steep. cost low income families might struggle cover. fully support people using less plastic diapers take 500 years decompose, also necessity tight budgets. cloth diapers, make sure donate instinct least Pfizer approved kids we'll see that. point adults eligible (and time) unvaccinated people get covid that's them. Kids different story right can't vaccinated, give year whatever schools mandating alongside rest think 100% back normal. Well likely die car crash every day die covid vaccinated, makes sense.   wholeheartedly agree, honestly fair Fauci face pandemic bc he's going one catches flack. statement multiple times.

I'm anything ""because government tells to"", doctors scientists pretty much united behave trust medical experts. Seems rather **strange** happening *now* They're recommendations, chill   Lmao yet sports games concerts sell venues. Makes total sense! will, remain compliant, stay well can, protect family. Like yearly flu shot. FYI facial tingling numbness covid infection receiving JJ vaccine. Went away cases maybe us susceptible it. honestly suggesting resuming normal social life one goals vaccine??? don’t even know respond that. anyone listens science facts beyond me. decided science fact based thinks “the public handle” lied oath congress multiple times. Republican party essentially reliably centrally accessible medical records country. That's one many issues universal healthcare fixes. Well...sorta. depends version sales pitch listening to.

As things stand now, they're quite good keeping people getting really sick, good keeping people hospital.

Breakthrough cases, however, much significant people realize.  I've lived across country family 7 years, I've never home Christmas. first year job gives 2 weeks paid vacation holidays. We're vaccinated force heaven earth stop seeing Christmas especially spending last Christmas literally entirely alone week. whole point supposed long. Except family antivax like mine. Byeeee messaging optics terrible. don’t know else explain it. We’ll wait see it’s safe families see holidays! don’t worry, it’s fine 100k person events long everybody flashes piece paper way in!

For record, I’m fine large gatherings think requiring vaccines attend great idea. it’s ridiculous entertain notion vaccinated family friends reconsider getting together holidays, ever matter. 

The message “hey you’re vaccinated little worry about. weren’t worried getting sick year, good go one you’ve gotten shots. Want extra safe? Make sure grandma got booster, think getting one qualify.” I'm pro vaccines come, family country, there's way I'll gathering Christmas. 


With said, world people avoid gathering holidays. ones celebrate person last year, without vaccines, absolutely year. skipped last year's, likely vaccinated time, miss second one. 


The realistic solution, Delta still issue breakthrough cases, offer boosters general population November (about 6 months people started getting shots, effectiveness may start seeing reduction), keep many reasonable people hospitals possible. able anything rest. I'm sorry medical personal may miss yet another holiday trying save life idiots (as well lives everything right got unlucky). J&amp;J still effective delta variants. equate slight decrease immunity mild illness ""not immunity"". video wife J&amp;J teaches preschool kids also little (emphasis little) worried much vaccinated. looking booster. nobody getting ""the flu"" anymore, ""pneumonia"".. deaths probably 90% lumped together counted covid deaths. Non-covid related respiratory deaths practically nonexistent anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

Wow! mean tell year encouraging mask use protocols limit spread infectious flu-like disease, far fewer cases flu?! almost like pandemic protocols we've used designed response deadly flu pandemic something! 

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, logic literally zero people died HIV/AIDS ever since virus alone killed single person... Instead, opportunistic infections conditions caused virus kill people... Or, also logic, ""***I*** kill person! died blood loss effects bullet happened fired gun, that's fault!""

Very people die flu, virus matter. die effects virus body, case Influenza, multiple organ failure caused cytokine storm immune system overreacts infection, ARDS caused lungs filling fluid due immune response infection.

&amp;#x200B;

Pneumonia stand-alone virus pathogen derived illness.. condition lungs fill fluid ***caused*** several dozen viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, even environmental pollutants. Covid Influenza two common causes Pneumonia, someone either Covid Influenza dies Pneumonia, listed dying virus. 

In regards previous metaphor, Pneumonia, ARDS, Multiple Organ Failure ""bleeding death"", Covid-19 Influenza bullets, people spreading ignorant bullshit grasp actual way works often asshole pulled trigger. There's committee. Fauci focal point right anything says news. need someone blame justify actions.  Well since Democrat president assure chance gather around holidays Failing institute secure central system one first serious failures Biden administration. laughable expect this. sure mean ""against"" question asked specifically quote part.  dumb question graceful answer knowing people love take soundbites context. cuff, better answer would ""if trends continue, holidays might fine. best way make sure everyone get vaccinated soon possible"" Vaccines people 90% less likely die covid.
What consider acceptable risk? Even mandates EUA *can* made, plenty companies organizations still waiting full approval issuing ton dropped within days full approval. think matter ease perception, necessarily legal technicality. Given something like maybe 40% people fully vaccinated even official recommendations (and Christmas, could much less). makes sense guidance tailored unvaccinated partially vaccinated majority. 

That said, also depends live. Places like Alabama still basically 0 spare ICU capacity. anything make things worse, advice may actually reasonable (even though they're mess first place since follow recommendations). place like Connecticut, ICUs basically unaffected covid now, seems much silly.  Oh look another one made fun got it... messed world live can't things making statement rather keeping someone else safe.

The world gets divided day... Probably less people ""totally ignoring it"" paper pre-release peer reviewed, getting wide distribution media people comfortable results one way another, know probably cautiously optimistic, again, holding ""applause"" till gets eyeballs it. get vaccinated can't around vaccinated people?

To hasten end pandemic? vulnerable people (like vaccines don’t offer enough protection) won’t needlessly suffer die?  


Making one’s life personally pleasant isn‘t reason people things. Dangling carrot “you go back normal” nice, it’s true (e.g. pre-delta), that’s bad take reason people get vaccinated.   Nuh uh! *covers ears sticks tongue out* job straight forward factual, attempt manipulate people editorializing. Further, every time clear push fantasy scenarios vast majority people ignore dings credibility. always risks, going anywhere, understanding mitigate risk *within limits people realistically tolerate* needed here. vaccines effective Delta far preventing hospitalizations deaths, Delta contagious higher viral loads, even vaccinated people catch spread easier Alpha. reading pandemic, probably knew typed comment. wouldn’t advise anything since I’m doctor don’t think choose get 2 shot Moderna pfizer J&amp;J one shot supplemental shot. Zuckerberg hospital didn’t try book 2nd shot  Vaccines reduce risk death covid 90%.

What think acceptable level risk? I’m fully vaccinated. whole family is. I’ve listened year. I’ve worn mask, I’ve socially distanced, I’ve washed hands much often normally do, I’ve used hand sanitizer frequently. I’m going gather. don’t care. want see loved ones. Chest pain
* Rapid abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmias)
* Shortness breath, rest activity
* Fluid buildup swelling legs, ankles feet
* Fatigue
* signs symptoms viral infection headache, body aches, joint pain, fever, sore throat diarrhea  hardly anyone vaccinated kind needed to. said rolled vaccine along time before. got 1 moderna shot booster JJ Denmark. Got JJ end May booster last week. Denmark recommends mRNA booster 3 months JJ shot. Yep, this. held end bargain. needed last year keep everyone safe, got vaccinated soon able, relax little. I'll wear mask asked obviously things less back normal. I'm also progressive state high vaccination rates begin with, though. Almost died still ""hesitant"" vaccine.

These fucking morons lol, better race without tbh. /JurassicParkLessons Good stuff, think 95% families celebrated similarly normally would have. ""life .... uhhh .... finds way"" Reread comment. They’re saying “it’s way common Covid”. Covid cause myocarditis, they’re saying “yes, people gotten myocarditis vaccine, still much likely get myocarditis Covid vaccine”. Niiiice! hope becomes standard It’s fascinating vaccines become politicized another experimental drug, polymerase inhibitor clear side effects, immediately embraced quacks reason avoid vaccination. one pretending vaccines exist. Sadly, many people pretending CDC guidelines don't.

""Even fully vaccinated, live area substantial high transmission COVID-19, better protected wear mask indoor public places."" 94% US experiencing Substantial High Transmission today.

Yes, less 2% COVID deaths 2021 fully vaccinated, many people ""just-vaxxers"" unwilling continue precautions contributing COVID's continued spread deaths. would think getting Covid would much likely impact supply, would stress getting Covid. 

I doubt actual studies supply though. Drinking tons water nursing often would help potential dip though. Related read: higher antibody levels make difference initial trials -hough may VOC's present Pfizer trialed purely wildtype. percentage extra antibodies entirely consistent efficacy-vs-antibodies curve connecting vaccines. Yep family work vaccinated, still ranting raving they'll never vaccinated... They've living life covid exist anymore, putting restrictions us. think want us anything without think tbh.

I've worked medical field point see covid coming end, we've gotten place control get vaccines every year like flu shot likely. There's definitely still lot people scared.   know incredibly stupid, living far North, practically Arctic. stupid.  flu 6 7. remember details 30 years ago, remember super high fever delusional seeing things shadows. ran whole first grade class. came back, 3 kids sick. customer who’s father died COVID height worst winter surges, masks absolutely required area. wasn’t wearing mask got aggressive told put one on, finally masked up, went rant father died COVID week point masks since nothing anyway.

I thinking like…your dad died COVID, wouldn’t least want TRY lower risk others?  Shit super low, least compensating, much funeral cost India? Stopped really caring guys say Walensky weird crying bit national television. stupid. theyre considering it, me, means avoid gathering Christmas. antivax person could teacher? Even 1 million chance hurt child. removed license. think discussion medical titles.  Yeah I’m aware meeting countries allow mixing. don’t really see could hurt.   There's source Buenos Aires city longest lockdown article. 3 regimen actually looks lot like HPV vaccine regards timing. resemblance uncanny.

DTaP. MMR, Polio, etc. require 3+ doses spaced months even years apart. two dose vaccine spaced 3-4 weeks apart would outlier world vaccines. comment Alpha ☝🏻 nightmare never ends. mean everywhere else still live restrictions whole time lockdown. least got enjoy normal life outside that. [The CDC found evidence masking children prevent struck lightning. elementary school lectures lightning safety every year. Apparently happened nowadays there's protests right climb tall metal flagpoles thunderstorms. Why? vaccine still 95%+ effective severe illness 6 months out. panic needing booster shots everyone immediately ridiculous. Covid never particularly dangerous individual level, catastrophic health systems. Trying get nuance across also downplaying fairly difficult. can’t imagine widely available. Monoclonal requires 2+ hour IV supervising medical professional. Anti-viral basically “here’s pills instructions.” logistics would orders magnitude less complicated headline misleading, least.

Look what? Google? dude honestly worst. understand dumbass comments like make people think vaccine worthless?  Except nobody getting ""the flu"" anymore, ""pneumonia"".. deaths probably 90% lumped together counted covid deaths. Non-covid related respiratory deaths practically nonexistent anymore.   job literally attempt prevent people dying. advocate put people risk. So... memes wrong?

Otherwise, I'm really happy forced work (I virtual work). got sick beginning '19 mysterious illness Japan. Sick 6+ months I'm still experiencing pains it, two years later. thank covid! Covid vaccines actually given us really great chance fight win flu. Moderna preparing combo flu/Covid vaccine could potentially way effective traditional flu vaccines ever been. course lot people think flu big deal get flu vaccine insanely sad.  Damn that’s insane. people extremely risk averse and/or don’t understand cost/benefit analysis restrictions point pandemic. big thing end game? never 0 cases. resume living us viewing covid similarly flu? always weighed events mandates vaccines masks. talking about?  crash economy time...so biggie. Fuck yeah. lost year 1/2 seeing elderly parents. vaccinated waited obligatory 3 weeks post 2nd vax, road. Took week work spend every minute them. lost Dad 3 months later (not Covid related). smart, make time. symptoms since “recovered”, one died breakthrough infection. Fuck you. I'll celebrating Thanksgiving virtually year. 

The family made clear they'll going CDC guidelines holding large in-person family gathering. We're vaccinated, risk still high go. I'll attending via Zoom call, hopefully. 

It remains seen Christmas bring, though hopefully attend small gathering, double-masked distanced.    Right, maybe quarantine holidays.. combination misinformation mixed messaging. Fauci wore mask got vaccinated started wearing two masks. head CDC comes says vaccines prevent transmission. still recommend masks lockdowns even vaccinated. sends confusing message. Especially highly unvaccinated areas. That's all?! TN averaged close 5x many every week since school started. Total state population roughly equivalent. Yeah, tyrannical mandates common fuck long time. 
 
And that's mandates wrong need abolished.  chest pain main symptom? say ""yes"" unvaccinated ""no"" vaccinated. live Ontario Canada, one highest rates vaccination, city reaching 85% fully vaccinated 90% partially vaccinated. Everybody know vaccinated still partner's roommate trying prevent us going see fully vaccinated families first time 2 years. anybody trying protect, social distance.

They're even trying prevent us going small concert vaccination passports required YEAR now. Like ever allowed go back normal without backlash people? Yeah, anyone says ""just flu"" clearly concept flu virus actually is. probably get common cold call flu. lost good friend actual flu. 32 year old mom two picture health. flu awful.    Right? People totally seemed ignore it! Fauci's job necessarily PR. scientific standpoint he's saying right things, people point want hear anymore.  People going holiday parties, inevitable. would like think vaccinated - regardless.  he's saying soon tell whether bad idea, people seem implying he's doubling lockdowns. can't fix stupid   ""wants"" impartial. _job_ impartial. Dr. Fauci _is not_ part administration. What’s point authoritarianism can’t get people vaccinated? Look Saudi Arabia killing right now.    Thank link article. almost qualifies r/UpliftingNews . Getting milestone sooner I'd liked, envy single person worked pandemic even made money. know wants impartial someone administration trying get stuff done.  point, government saying stuff like either stupidity control man fucking idiot!!!!! can't believe people still listening him. I'm baffled guidance well.  got first mRNA shot March, getting fourth Wednesday.

Fourth? country in? qualify? Genuinely curious.  New Englander here. work retail, thankfully store's customers 60-40 masked/unmasked, though sure wish masked percentage higher. employees masked, supposed be, least. 

Shopping stores varies wildly area though. Recently fully-vaxxed sister went mulit-town shopping trip, masked course. said one town's store maybe two people ones masked, couple towns over, everyone wearing them.    listen advice medical scientists. make significant difference. Yeah, two months advance “too soon.” 100% trust science people working behind ending pandemic something dude bothered beginning. first 8 months would repeat shit something new &amp; outrageous. started speaking without saying anything all. says braindead shit. two months “too early tell” answer no. alpha peak nearly everyone unvaccinated delta peak 50% vaccinated indistinguishable data state. total cases period time.  Take heart, Ewl, still catch again, time significantly weakened lungs. least, going 'working out' five days week long, long time. ever. Well, make new, at-risk vaccinated friend use person excuse around large groups. youngest vaxxed we'll use excuse... Or, I'll say no.   Many, many colleges unfortunately (vaccine+ mask). Masking sucks need stop acting like minor inconvenience.  booster J&amp;J vaccine.

Was one-shot booster received? received J&amp;J march want Pfizer mRNA shot. get 2-shot Pfizer one Pfizer booster shot? would advise? TY! Also Zuckerburg hospital walk appt needed? Guy needs pr training then. foolish thing say context honestly know anyone listening anymore. includes vaccinated people. I'm still super careful, soon 9-year-old get shot, I'm gonna worry things much. predict Thanksgiving beginning new surge, like last year. could, also want everyone else able get well squash upcoming winter season. people won’t get semi-lie form way conversation prove point though haha - released actual numbers. dude apparently big “covid government weapon” train retweeted Trump. It’s sad seeing misinformation ruin people’s lives. death benefit funeral expenses. Agreed, knowledge horrifying virus. could just, idk, appoint one doctor Fauci, like done every health scare. would mitigate ton issues people right now.  Also lack critical thinking! avoid christmas unless vax, lets move on. Right? I've one take pandemic seriously entire time. I've working home year half, I've severely curtailed social interaction. wear mask everywhere, got vaccinated earliest opportunity.

I still visited parents holidays last year(after testing negative, course).  intend visit year. I'm neck woods, know one family - one D&amp;D friends wife - still avoiding places. mostly wife, taken things extreme even I, someone taken seriously possible since beginning, feels absolutely absurd.

They're vaccinated, everyone group vaccinated, wife (who even want play minimal contact group) vaccinated...and he's forced play remotely wife.    forgot /s there, buddy.  cases rare

This difficult verify, we're really tracking breakthrough numbers.

This purely anecdotal, wife's place employment COVID rip last month. 13 people got infected, 10 fully vaccinated while. Fortunately, less inconvenience terms symptoms severity...but, still. Good plan. certainly don’t want pitcher catcher! fair toddlers small children. kiddos understand mask goes nose.. dad hand...  LOL ""my patience wearing thin"" bro live life. think emotional damages staying inside 2 years straight VASTLY way impossibly small odds vaccinated person (with booster shot) dying covid. Please stop listening bureaucrat, take microscopic risk start living life. life even worth living youre locked inside? Seriously, ask that. irresponsible you! still contract spread virus even vaccinated! really want responsible killing innocent people? spend Christmas home. NYT made article haha I’m still using excuse avoid family holiday season, whatever final recommendations are. take Fauci seriously, think people would heed advice point vaccinated ones vaccinated never taking seriously begin number people altering usual plans year minimal best.  ♡( ◜‿◝ )♡  99+% people avoided gatherings last 6 months. similar amount avoided last year. large number problem never avoided gatherings around holidays. reality point. 

To discussing guidance recommendations holiday family gatherings year shows complete lack understanding actually happening overwhelming majority population. know, idea ain’t half bad! Anyone got Covid-19’s email?  Overwhelmed unvaccinated* I'm vaccinated. family vaccinated.

I seen two years. We're getting together... though handful unvaccinated holdouts likely invited we're tired crap.  Can’t see grandma year cuz Fauci said going football game 100,000 ppl. Something doesn’t add  didn’t see family government told to?  second conservatives hear coordinate even larger gatherings originally planned. Covid isn’t going anywhere. sit back enjoy show, guess. Spoiler alert : vaccinated get spread covid  realistic recommendations might included: Boosters eligible (most Pfizer already are) making sure avoid high risk activities several weeks get together vulnerable relatives. might mean skipping bars, concerts indoor dining November December. Avoid hanging unvaccinated people indoors. Wear high quality masks indoors public places. Exactly… that’s ppl don’t seriously, anyone puts pedestal He's acting like bothered look kind data instead mindlessly spouting things thinks sounds good.  Fascinating. Thanks replies everyone! playbook early last year. Color shocked.  Especially since you’re fine you’re ever going get. Thats giving 2 much credit  one cares said, they're going want regardless says. end day, they're words.

He advise holiday gatherings, people inevitably gather. focus risk mitigation vaccination, people need listen still continue want. NZ changes overstated. plan always aggressively suppress outbreak vaccine levels high enough, change timetable moved up. relaxing rules risk assessed low risk significantly improve quality life.

NZ never stopped returning residents. used managed isolation system control influx covid country.  ppl laugh him, laugh Democrats cuz u attached tight still research, despite husband caxxed month long hospitalization..............  don’t know get “highly” qualitative adverb, quantitative it’s subjective. 0.1% “high” someone thinks is. Maybe someone thinks 0.1% high 0.01% low. don’t. It’s matter opinion pointed trivial edge case, there’s nothing much look into. 
So you’re saying nobody said anything Christmas?   post locked incivility. fact needs done said concerning. It’s also late really stop them. cats bag point. us cautious always going without direction. rest moved on. vaccinated adults died Covid unvaccinated kids. Covid can’t simultaneously ageist virus hits exponentially harder get older time virus that’s equally dangerous ages. Unless there’s variant completely negates vaccine, I’m putting plans (and since Covid forever, there’s point worrying since there’s never point won’t risk). Totally unrealistic expectation well, it’s huge concern understand everyone healthy/low risk kids. goes school exposure lot ppl…. we've learned whole lot dumb, panicky, dangerous persons well.  unrealistic advice aside, people travel Christmas started making plans early last week, it’s early some.   Hey man got fully vaxxed listened experts, required protect community. wanna sit thumb ass smug look face go ahead one gonna wanna hang around person thumb ass.  MU Made-Up? sounds right. estimates hearing back 2020 it'll probably take ~3-4 years things return normal-ish within US. Mid credit scene: ones fervently gather anti-mask unvaccinated individuals. live city already getting thousands people town daily via sporting events, conferences, business, concerts, tourism, basic supply chain distribution. stuff going right now.

So say can't hang family nonsensical take already happening. yeah one gives fuck anymore. ever going get vaccinated gotten now. world resume now? virus stay. that's it. go back normal? news lot lately unvaccinated player Canadian NHL team. he’s headlines contracting illness vaccine designed Josh. year 600k people die condition? that's deaths COVID19, infections long term health problems even higher. Fyi, big bank work released vaccine requirements. Summary: Unvax mandatory testing 2x week. Unvax increase health insurance next year. Unvax can't travel work.

Tens thousands Americans still getting vaccinated every day, fwiw. dad 3 co-workers quit company announced mandate.

Only 3 people entire company means mandates working. understand getting downvoted. made similar comment &amp; also getting downvoted. trumpets upset excluding holiday plans? Thx!

Why? high risk?  getting downvoted. understand sentiment this. Especially situation! go finally visit gfs family nearly 2 years, im taking bunch tests me.

Ill test several times also skipped seeing family last year. Best believe I'm taking opportunity year. Lol omg guys please stop this. Get damn life. Ppl back normal stop fear fear fear someone breakthrough case got done isolation. vaccine turned COVID bad cold me. still getting sense smell back two days headaches chills nothing. long COVID either (just anecdotle). Even vaccine dont provide 100% protection would still get heart beat turn terrible virus common cold type virus. Well put. one thing forgot mention: 

Last year time (yes, know, vaccine) read heard whines: ""I'm tired this! I?! I'm want!""

Nary thought social consciousness, sake Humanity, much less lives fellow Americans. 

No matter much pleading begging, everyone went did. Florida alone resulted loss 15,000 lives last three months (we're still counting). Add deaths January on? can't find number. Perhaps someone help. 

Y'know...I really hoping see family year. Others' selfish actions denied that. Tell unvaccinated colleagues Yeah, right? stupid, begin with. think courageous implement NPI country would affect popularity, probably.    Fauci basically yelling void point. IDK even listens anymore. we're vaccinated else want us do??   makes much sense hindsight too. course better nothing, TONS people wore mask still caught bad cases Covid. really bandaid waiting main surgery. press release they(Merck) say no. also say try create offspring course treatment. Yes, main point vaccines prevent hospitalizations/severe Covid. extremely effectively, neutralizing immunity icing cake. Fantastic news. updates EUA 12s US? still “a weeks out” last Monday? everyone negative, miserable person like either. is, that's current reality. point exactly.

As said another post, large gatherings (festivals etc), safe least see parents sibling. vaccinated. would argue not. instance, vaccinated person wearing mask ""careful"" stupid logic applies: *masks protect protect others... sick*. avoiding ""normal"" behavior.

There's lot ""be careful"" drives justification onerous restrictions population. 

My argument is: get vaccine, not. get hell go back normal. long people scared, government use justify restrictions. wonder parents took advantage opportunity sure would last name.  Well, neccesarily.

He still te expert. me.

But happen live California, entire family vaccinated. ever time safe past 2 years now.

I still large public events yet, smaller, trusted social circles yes.    You’re really misinformed. people stay home sick, even unvaxxed people wear masks required (although cloth masks proven effective still acceptable, plenty vaxxed still wear mask noses) idea unvaxxed population specific demographic thoroughly debunked propaganda it’s actually diverse demographic age, ethnicity also education. boosters designed variants, much smaller pool vaccinated continuously get boosters every 4-6 months. There's near zero risk meeting family members outside wearing masks tested.  Taking test stagnant. shows time had/didn't covid. Unless immediate result, effective.

And like people, even mask would tempted want hug them, interfering 6 feet.

I'm one take covid lightly. spent 2 years everything, waiting vaccine. it. ever ""safe time"" visit family, now. imagine entire city *dying*? can't, yet half US convinced effected. Mandatory boosters going happen. Maybe healthcare environments, otherwise blather. speak primary care provider, let highlight something ACOG:



  American College Obstetricians Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends eligible persons greater age 12 years, including pregnant lactating individuals, receive COVID-19 vaccine vaccine series.  condolences loss. feel like I'm saying almost daily now. strange thing wife used get asked medication advice understand they're taking. Now, gets asked forge vaccination card... stopped talking COVID vaccines people, starts argument around topic education understand, want to. true doing...

All things *way* simple suggestion somebody 'being careful'. think it’s referring city region, maybe messaging still impact size manner gatherings  fear people look declining cases prematurely declare victory again. We’ve seen especially holidays approaching. Oh, get now. Yeah, getting less likely see big variants all, let alone ones totally evade existing immunity. read full article paywall, quick Google search says Boston's population 4 million. Anyone know difference numbers coming from? got breakthrough case. Got J&amp;J March. promise vaccine held case relatively mild. I'm hoping booster top previously infected really triggers one hell immune response. LMAO. went Jan packed baseball game day. one cares anymore. Either vaccinated that's going be. Someone George Bush holding MISSION ACCOMPLISHED banner. Yes, acquiring super good odds dying better rolling dice without drastically improved odds. sure getting voted right take Game changing Delta changed dramatically fast virus spread technical mutation was. 

Now possible almost nobody left virus mutates escape current vaccines? idea, I'm dumb guy internet. EXACTLY mind lmao People said June well pre-delta, would agree things looking good right also soon say look like 3 months Yeah listen anymore. Everytime see article like OP quoting Fauci roll eyes. (Not OP, article general) think he's obviously concerned emergence dangerous variant Christmas. Also, stupid question.

As former first Lady said, ""fuck Christmas"" Well, depends religion/cult person question could in. friend newborn that's breastfeeding. fully vaxxed. 6 month window coming soon. high risk environment (law enforcement). wants booster shot worried whether booster stop milk supply. Turn tap, speak.

I'm asking internet, anyone provide studies show whether mRNA covid shot limits stops breastfeeding mom's milk supply? booster shot supposed cater new variants. Someone willing take original vaccine mot gonna getting boosters either. whole vaccine efficacy waning besides point. People gonna get also get protection new strains soon. forget, longer keep debate going, fancier strains coming out. anti-vax crowd really believe self-isolation masks either, like trust work towards public good anyways. case deep shit puddle begin with. hate inconvenienced yapping day 1, yet wanna take one option actually make difference rid restrictions good. rather necessitating covid tests, get vaccine really negatives covid makes lives lot people much easier.  Lol part Fox News definitely true id say you’re underestimating. 

I’ve seen get “because family wouldn’t happy got it”. family member tell stop talking mom they’re getting it. never said masks, especially schools required. vaccination employees school kids old enough. addition, ventilation increased whenever possible. people stop worrying move actions taken risks kids vanishingly small.  appreciate that, thank you. Oh, “let’s pretend haven’t already made mind act surprised people annoyed I’m springing bad news last second” routine again? perfectly okay that. There's always going edge cases unsafe gather.

But saying general thing everyone right. family vaccinated able get together, barring unusual situations like yours.

I hope mom stays healthy safe. Thank you!  lot companies returning office, leading tech workers look remote jobs instead  production value hoax *really* good.  know new drug targeting RNA replication via type enzyme (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RdRp) found RNA viruses. type enzyme notorious extremely error prone (this you’ll often hear scientists say stuff along lines “RNA viruses mutate frequently”).

Thanks! comforting know. *Winter entered chat* Oh you’re one doesn’t affect personally doesn’t matter people aren’t you?  I’m blocking since opinion longer matters me. It’s least educated staff refusing get it, primarily CNAs Dietary staff. You’re required offer every staff member resident. lot went long without getting Covid figure “already it” won’t get it. There’s also don’t want told do. It’s really pathetic low staff vaccination rates nursing homes considering hard they’ve hit. Many staff refusing literally worked Covid unit saw first hand deadly still refuse get it. I’m federal mandate healthcare facilities accepting Medicare/Medicaid money people aren’t getting stupid reasons see people cite social media.  you’re vaccinated, definitely go see parents. Everyone should.  think “gathering” aspect of: throw multi-family Christmas party. It’s soon know good/bad idea be.

&amp;#x200B;

While it’s awesome vaccines that’ll keep everyone hospital/morgue, you’re still left decision: throw party stands good chance getting half guests really really sick?

&amp;#x200B;

It still sucks. it’s better 2020 lot ways. get control, next year even better. unfortunately lot people keep spreading ""vaccines work, keep locking down"" theme.   well good, really matter accept fact COVID endemic human population never go away.

So true 0-COVID impossible (or least far high cost achieve) viable vaccine (at least 4 options globally) therapeutics (remesdivir), doing:

1. Lock-downs
2. Mask mandates
3. Mandatory vaccination policies

Anymore? It’s logical refuse take actions mitigate risk easy mitigations masks reduce risk. It’s also illogical ignore risks may smaller population level impossible predict individual basis, additive risks already face, risk compounds less mitigate.    people would heed Dr. Fauci fully vaccinated.

The people hate Fauci listen anyways. 

My point: says useless. believe you’re vastly underestimating socioeconomic cost continuing restrictions, I’m sure you’re basing estimates impact new infections either. Lmao dumb comment 1. actively sick, gather! 
2. extra protection, get tested gathering, especially traveling around older relatives
3. gather anti-vax/wilfully unvaccinated family members That's bit weird, pretty much safely meet outside wear FFP3 masks. Seriously, touch be?

Why tell people family vaccinated, gather Christmas? People going avoid seeing family second holiday season row.

It's like WANT people get frustrated stop listening them. know have, part. still mask crowded indoor public spaces that's it. exactly sure assuming died Oct, we're talking exactly year ago month, correct vaccine available. However, mention exactly died, Dec 22, 2020, took zero precautions. We're Arkansas, COVID exist according droves people scream wife daily pharmacy.

We 4 kids, boys. Twins @ 20, 16, &amp; 11. many option, we've lockdown since Jan 2020 lack concern state, including family friends. wife comes home heartbroken almost daily sad stories like article, threats life helping microchip everyone. seem like almost nobody left infect, right?

If another variant *like Delta*, make much difference people vaccinated immunity previous infection. would take lot mutations make enough difference. lol

they never gave shit stats state Georgia United States immunity evading variant. (this seems pretty unlikely)

Yep, B cells cells still job stop hospitalizations death rates go control. predicting waves virus always gone poorly.

W.H.O. informing world seeing drop death cases covid general, maybe that's sign. edited post 2 hours posted this. 😀 Obviously, depends vaccination rates time. 1% Georgians vaccinated (not sure available via Covax country) Covid rates are, would mark them. mean, likely case, missing data point. Also, Georgia seen use Moderna. That's cool, right fully vaccinated people adults. Young children (toddler-4) definitely fully vaccinated probably even eligible Xmas. likely chunk 5-12 age range fully vaccinated, even best case scenario. snag comes approval process, could back square one.

Tired we're still pandemic. plan Xmas beginning October; situation may change. want may something control. Hopefully, tail end pandemic, we're starting turn endemic phase, we're yet. idea headline writers keep using stuff like headlines. hospital stats say 'only 10% covid patients vaccinated"". completely uninformative without context. clue, predicting virus always gone poorly. seem like two month two months cycle, there's explanation why.  Well current government even worse. serfs. Politics aside. Morals aside. Please get healthy, Mr. Kavanaugh.

Not much changed us. Cool thanks I’ll forward info  I’m vaccinated. vaccination free available want it. Time move on. That's misinformation oh, good point. i’m area quite well, remember things peaking beginning year harder get free test lines LONG. still, case testing holidays hopefully something arranged advance notice! school requirement test PCR 5 days exposure. typically takes 24-48 hours results.

The antigen tests fast higher rates false negatives.

They probably also wearing N95 similar masks travel. laughing hard. Bah humbug! while. Sanjay Gupta CNN even in-house bit early  articles dumb. People going want point. many antivaxxers posting here, brain used saying ""It’s way common **than** covid"" lot things. shit, fucking october  sounds fantastic! 

What's need run around busting assess holidays?! bet he'll see family Christmas. Heh. I'm ashamed say Canadians decided throw ""Covid party"" get immunity natural way. Several ended hospital, least ICU, time province cancelling cancer surgeries sending patients province due hospital load. 

Every time say ""that's stupidest thing far"", someone somewhere saying ""hold beer..."".      crushing covid ultra-draconian covid rules vaccination madates. US federal vaccine tracking system, individual states do, make secure verification happen. Unfortunately bunch states chosen ban mechanisms choose confound personal rights societal well being. says clairvoyant. Many things happen. variant vaccine much weaker example. Probably normal Christmas vaccination rates high enough makes definite statement cannot react unforeseen circumstances without looking like liar Yes! That’s have, love it. wish one made federally every state own. think it’s much difficult fake electronic records, can’t counterfeit steal/sell blanks they’re electronic! Yeah, vaccinated, wear properly-fitted N95 nearly public indoor environments. Plus we’re talking huge gatherings. Maybe it’s okay.  Exactly, spread misinformation towards west never thought would also turn back them. 14 day isolation nice holiday limited family members last year. Made big difference older family members outlook.  They'll alive vote. That's something. still kids age 5 would remain unvaccinated.  protecting people around you, vulnerable are, good enough reason get vaccination own?!

No, that's concern contact anyone.

The whole point vaccine able around people circumstances less vulnerable

Getting vaccinated still staying apart isolated makes zero sense.  willing lock forever there's reason get vaccine. make difference last year... would doubt anyone going change plans due Covid year. Thank you! blanket statements guidances helping us get this. Provincetown proved that.   imagine it. picture city, imagine people live there, imagine dying.  believe difficult get test present harder-hit areas U.S. will, worry that, unless strain comes along outcompetes Delta sudden likely near future.  don’t explain funded research lead “pandemic” NYS also Excelsior Pass Plus, issues SMART health card - add Samsung Pay (now) Apple wallet (soon) - bunch states adopting it, well pharmacies. answer question definitely told soon us example. health system collapse? yes lockdowns worthwhile. 

It bought us time get vaccinated letting rip, interesting see happens open shortly you, that's makes comfortable feel guilty. note, vaccinated want get together shunned either - need respect people's decisions. feel this. I’ll also 36 weeks pregnant staying holidays. I’m pretty glad it. also build resentment. think people forced get going showing dissaproval upcoming mid-term elections. mandates work.

Forcing people something threatening take away livelihoods, yes respond getting vaccine, ""most"" also respond voting ones forced mandate people forgive forget. population Wyoming. We've killed US state still half country thinks whole thing ""overblown"". small children actually better following public health rules 40% people

They might like it, they'll go along it, instead throwing public tantrum ending r/PublicFreakout You’re missing context, brother. 

Someone claimed United States lockdown “people saying” continue locked down. 

They demonstrably wrong. I’m guessing that’s comment mod-deleted. ;) already research ended hospital. dumbass. 25 overweight, 30+ obese, important distinction fat ass.  Life without kids sounds serene! FDA scheduled meetings later month make decision Pfizer vaccines ages 5-11. passed time almost kids fully vaccinated Christmas. Also Moderna J&amp;J booster shots may also available timeframe. hear lot, though responsible enough stay home don’t feel well takes, literally every person know got covid, got someone wasn’t feeling symptoms yet, got ill later. family 50% unvaccinated. point I'll start new family Christmas dinner tradition going hang qultists submission removed because

Like, that's HUUUUUGGGGEEEE deal!!  4th worst month deaths entire thing basically one anything stop it. feel like I'm losing mind. closing restaurants everything else problem nothing compared now. neighbors, family actively trying too. wife stretched patience past breaking point parents families.

My cousin Facebook recently BRAGGING getting vaxed picture young daughter sick it. Like posts pictures sick kids pandemic bragging making worse? different myocarditis, caused viruses. point it’s usually dangerous. Treated symptomatically NSAIDs resolves days.  cannot wait kid vaccinated reason.    No, they're taking care themselves. Breakthrough cases happen, put risk someone can't barest prevention necessary. would cut basically anyone family vaccinated. brings fresh air dilutes potential viral particles. Ventilation probably important thing prevent covid. make sense many areas? Well….  here. Fully vaccinated got COVID. Kept thinking much worse would without vaccinated. pretty miserable several days even vaccine. headlines say “Fauci says ‘too soon tell.’” 

How even slightly misinterpretation statement?  Yeah, seen football stadiums? 

Concerts? 

Other large events? 

Most people going celebrate family matter Fauci government says.

If haven’t learned yet, aren’t paying attention. 

I think way bigger issues family gatherings Christmas. Yeah, texture thing.    Sucks them. Luckily though, age group big concern covid. Yes, spent good chunk last year pumping gigatons disinformation Western vaccines order discredit subjects' minds. did, discredited *all* vaccines, including own. Oops.

This season finding out. Even is, one going gather. didn’t last year. sure hell won’t stop year. Yeah, people swear never born taste buds. mention they've got vaccine that's even sketchier sputnik. sad what’s happening society. Divide conquer. Lay McDonald’s go hike ☺️.That make feel little better. checked vaccine cards attendees.

I cancel going show recently, I'm kinda glad did. many people various facebook groups talking fake cards/test results. Turns group going hang - 2 people ended Covid afterward. 

Some people going fuck everyone else. def another possibility elections matter mean popularity's unimportant. Macron unpopular, democratic process gives legitimacy. authoritarian state, legitimacy actually depend popularity.

That said, think failing health system worse short term popularity loss. [Update: Fauci said live CA almost people see still wear masks. forget important caveat: actually care health people communities. 

I want disease vector around me, certainly want host prolongs pandemic causes additional harm. people still asking opinion? Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically.

Comparing number Pandemrix doses administered Covid vaccine doses administered I'd think we'd definitely VAERS going nuts anything like happening since whole world possible Covid vax side effects microscope. Remember '80s frauci said catch AIDS HIV touching someone. Oooof. That's lower UK lambasted low number critical care beds which, memory serves, 6 per 100K. half Germany possesses. Yeah, Delta gets foothold, NZ could world shit.

&amp;#x200B;

This said, several months ago listened podcast featured prominent, experienced British doctor - veteran healthcare scene (I forget name). made observation stuck since follows. hospitals - least West - built one-stop-shops manner ailments conditions. breeding grounds Covid virus circulated throughout hospitals via HVAC systems. hindsight, said, we'd better treating Covid patients large, heated, medically-equipped tents away hospital locations proper. i.e. segregate confirmed Covid cases dedicated, equipped, ventilated tents hospitals continue normal sick Covid receive care need minimizing risk infecting others.

Treating patients tents away hospitals carries bad optics political angle - look third world - may well best approach dealing largely unvaxxed population NZ's. Chicago killing lately.  call Fauci bureaucrat?  comes not, guarantee many will.  Problem covid still spreading. extended family vaccinated except kids 12. got together Saturday 25th September. time outside. days later, mom stepfather started showing symptoms tested positive covid. They’ve vaccinated Moderna since March. Now, bunch us sick, tests coming back negative covid- likely cold spread. thought safe, are, back worrying covid. mom said though, grateful vaccine, knows she’d hospital without right now. bad wasn’t quick enough getting booster became available immunocompromised people. Now, she’s home miserable. Next time, she’ll listen pester go get right away. virus it, collective reaction ""meh.""

You can't see virus, can't send soldiers shoot virus can't bomb virus. That's it. Sending soldiers die supporting bombing campaigns kill civilians ""other people problem."" happens far away people. get hear TV badguys got got, chant USA times go day. Wearing mask going bar football game though? Well dangit impact life stand it!  wild skip vaccine, low likelihood side effects medication proven side effects likely long-term effects.  [Narrator: No.] great moderation place today...zero content Fair call. thought luckily husband staying home anyway toddler. I'd super love get full 3rd dose Moderna cause 2nd one brutal us I'm chase toddler around feeling like haha. hope info soon. Yeah little broad….really meant Sydney/Melbourne commenters thread scoffing, understand everyone gathering fully vaccinated (especially since many boosters). parent young child probably eligible vaccine early next year, accepted Delta struck holidays would look much like 2020. 😟 point, reason believe another spike later fall/winter, husband insistent toddler gain first antibodies vaccine rather infection.  used find zombie apocalypse premise kind ridiculous zombies hard contain long stay inside sort sturdy structure like...cover skin can't get bitten.

Needless say longer find quite ridiculous.  NZ stopped complying rules seems reasonable me. No. NZ stopped complying rules gangs churches killed us  True. Antibodies breast milk also useful given regularly, don’t really know gives blood antibodies. 

However think it’s fair assumption antibodies baby vaccination utero give protection, least months. Pfizer study 5-11 tested antibody levels indicator think it’s safe enough assumption Aye. That’s fine, I’m putting there. Yup, Way back TWIV like forever ago thought made fantastic case  thank smoke. retired 62 he's terribly old. event taking chances. power ((globalists)) truly far reaching. Downvoted. I’m curious many people resigned. 96% remaining good number, 10,000 resigned 96 remaining 100 vaccinated, you’d hit percentage (obviously numbers made up, get idea).

I say someone knows ton people Staten Island area pissed this. saw article mentioned substitutes hand difficulties planning Staten Island, still curious many actually left.

Regardless, think right necessary move. really hard feel bad russia large % disinformation coming russia. “I’m natural health person, trusted immune system.”

Obviously trust much, went hospital. I'm sure kids this, congrats? Yes, doctor good idea current condition potential contraindications relating condition. goes specialist ITP, would even better ask GP.  I'm seeing fam. Here's plan-

-flight involved, fam wear masks (n95 adults, surgical kids) 

-adults fam vaccinated 6 months ago

-kids vaccinated Christmas, taking chances not

-fam staying vaccinated, elderly boosters

-when meet folks go places, adults take dose taffix. indoors gathering area, mask up. family house, mask


That's folks. this, get covid, get covid. live healthy lives, overweight diabetes blood pressure, ready take herbal stuff like ginger teas help systems travel. That's best do, otherwise live life. want go way disingenuous anything everything Fauci says.  think better answer would been, “For now, don’t plan gathering. We’ll get back know more.” one country eliminate disease contagious covid? either global effort going away.  keep using word... Russian goverment driven vaccine conspiracy theories, done little encourage faith Sputnik V. manufacturing issues definitely help. they're reaping whirlwind citizens paying price. ain’t waiting indefinitely people choose never get vaccinated. I’m seeing family Lol statement going spring awakening watching packed football stadiums weekend. fuck going home Christmas going do?   authorized, likely 65+ only? allow everyone? antivaxx protestors show kid's school I'll happily meet there.  Delta variant happened COVID prominent able mutate

i mean, sort of--but likely India, first detected. v pro vaccine worth think argument dumb americans need get vaccinated greater numbers prevent next pernicious variant rings kinda hollow huge, huge swathes rest world still perfectly good incubators new baby extended family mother said everyone isn’t tested, aren’t going Thanksgiving Christmas. Everyone already vaccinated. forget still 6 weeks whenever approved there's even *any* fully vaccinated children.

So get vaccines beginning November every child gets vaccinated immediately, barely protected time Christmas. live alternate world. saw poll showed unvaccinated think vaccinated unvaccinated get hospitalized/die rate. 

Facts nothing people. Funny spending money jobless benefits huge issue people spending trillions pointless wars never seemed big deal.

Not I'm directing you. speaks volumes us. soon people wait longer hamburger people deemed essential year ago turned enemy again. us high-risk children ineligible vaccination. Even vaccine, bad flu contagious. flu sucks. I've living life normal months mask on. Back got first dose March extremely optimistic. baby fall 2020. remember thing getting holidays Christmas 2021. told everyone that’s everything would back normal. 

So frustrating   Exactly things supposed instead rubber-stamping things.

AKA, take time, antivaxxers would right vaccine rushed without oversight.

It's take time review data ensure everything up-and-up speedy release vaccine trustworthy. fair, hard time blaming media whole. Like, video transcript Fauci actually said [*right media widely reported it. 

To put simply, folks straight-up don’t care actually said aren’t discuss facts, iykwim. It’s emotionally charged rhetoric way down.    Yep. cold makes cranky sniffly week. flu shaking sweating ground one night nowhere. wiped days. still go work though didn’t sick time. 😐  U screw opinion. got vaccine, let unvax hurt themselves. I'm getting Christmas on!  question really large gatherings be. hundred, dozens, less 10? Americans died result COVID-19 population one following: 
 
 - Wyoming (state smallest population)
 - Vermont (2nd smallest) 
 - District Columbia 
 - Within next 10 days: Alaska (3rd smallest)
 - end month: North Dakota (4th smallest)
 - Nashville, TN
 - Oklahoma City, OK 
 - Portland, OR
 - Las Vegas, NV 
 - Within next 10 days: Denver, CO
 - end month: Seattle, WA (18th largest city)
 - total number deaths sides US Civil War, bloodiest American conflict history 
 - total number American deaths conflicts American soldiers involved past 250 years (minus Civil War) **combined**. 
 - approximate estimated number American deaths ""Spanish Flu"" epidemic 1918. 
 - Americans killed auto accidents year 2001 present **combined** 
 - Americans killed commercial airplane accidents year 1919 present **x 58 times over** Yeah. followed every precaution wiping groceries, getting vaccinated avoiding gatherings. another holiday season others never gave damn first place. Olympic bubble one strictest quarantines planet led almost 900 cases. impossible Delta. contagious. I’m fairly sure COVID last Thanksgiving got J&amp;J. got fairly strong immune response, call work two days. feel pretty confident immunity J&amp;J haha Expectations != what's acceptable.

If there's school shooting, I'm going expect kids going die. make deaths acceptable.

""Acceptable"" means ""the status quo good enough"". deaths acceptable, means always strive improve status quo.

Zero covid deaths children acceptable. I'm sure they're tired beg survive poor unfortunate circumstance see it. 

There resources look thread unhoused come see much easier said done. state subreddit thread asshole saying bulldozing housing camps. people got job, go get ready? Clean up? hold job know cop crew going clear tent entirety earthly possessions? 

Shelters full kick out. wait line get bed. work set schedule? amount barriers getting back feet staggering that's assuming issues beyond control more, whether substance abuse mental health. 

What said ignorant reality people's positions, also come tbe mouth someone privileges never spot. live?! senior high school, fill sign out/sign sheet sit outside cafeteria 10’ away. couldn’t wandering halls lunch Check get back me. mean that’s fair point people aren’t able get vaccinated forced work, long valid reason pre-pandemic things? Covid always going around going risk rest lives. I’m near kid Red Sox game parents accepted risk exposed Covid. Nope, unvaccinated ones suffer it. Get vaxxed. Get family vaxxed. they're vaxxed, either go, eat outside mask up. Like dicks big, please first all, fuck FUD?

You're making assertions data yet scientifically illiterate one eh?

lol mean, Detroit tried best die huge chunks indeed reclaimed nature. it’s still kicking. surprising thing many people seemingly believed them. It’s questionable demanding QR code becomes available person vaccination help things. Yes, try obtain fake QR codes, actually get vaccinated, people summer heard easier travel (certain countries allowed vaccinated Sputnik people come without quarantine PCR test). Vaccinating rates ok back then. many 1000 plus educators vaccinated? Except Vermont case rates similar Alabama among young people case rates high they've ever adults. September second deadliest month pandemic. lot heads buried sand NE. fucken world Fauci living on? saw football stadiums packed past weekend. like people like respect “principles” . Honestly, wear mask even vaccinated personally known several people gotten breakthrough cases COVID vaccine, since high risk, willing take even mild case help it.   We're done here. 

Your final sentence flagrant FUD scientific illiteracy action. really want too. nice run several houses celebrate. Since us gathering vaccinated, decide feel comfortable with. 

My partner eligible Pfizer booster November. Fingers crossed moderna gets booster approved. Russia China helped weaponize social media amplify dissonance. rich control Republican Party learned use weaponization help political agenda lower taxes Wishing things normal obtaining earned normalcy

they practical material terms exactly thing talking public life conducted--one scenario busier hospitals  kids eat outdoors don’t talk - kind grim we’ve already one classmate COVID spread within class school protocols appear work. could still steeped ""natural immunity better vaccine immunity"" thing. Thanksgiving thru New Year's going keep Grimm Reaper extra busy picking gatherings unvaxxed. could one possibly argue 0.1% **highly** effective?

I agree sentiment find odd started talking ""effective"" wording question ""highly effective"" Translation: Ifs probably unsafe say y’all travel even weren’t planing to. I’m gonna shut up, know things like safe nobody changing ways point 🤷🏼‍♂️… guess, trying get people get vaccines, maybe don’t put ridiculous quote people doubling hatred him. kinds fines and/or jail time realistically going get?  Presumably unemployable lose license, difficult get reinstated re-licensed another state nearby? 

I'm trying decide obvious answer (she's bright worrying long term consequences) something disheartening (she knows penalties harsh money making worth risk.) comparable vaccines infectious viruses yearly suites Influenza shots.

Flu shots generally 40 60% effective preventing symptomatic influenza infections; give vaccinated 26% lower risk hospitalization, 31% lower risk dying Influenza.

Compared numbers similarly dynamic evolving viral threat Covid many variants, Covid suite Vaccines effective preventing symptomatic infections, numbers currently available, even effective preventing hospitalizations deaths vaccinated.

The problem people comparing results Covid Vaccination vaccines led eradication viral illnesses like Smallpox Polio. people making flawed comparison ignoring factors made vaccines effective eradicating nearly eradicating specific viruses versus Covid influenza vaccines capable since viruses radically different morphology, epidemiological patterns, fast mutate, ability evade immune responses. Positive third grader well. catch school though, older brother (vaccinated) brought home breakthrough case highschool. Thankfully totally asymptomatic minus sniffles day. Imagine actually thinking  understanding risk myocarditis really possible vaccine administered intravenously (where reaches heart) vs muscle tissue (where stays breaks down). Yes, current risk extremely low, perhaps lowered even improved training cautionary procedures? I'm confused people retaliating educated opinion saying ""too soon tell""? say ""no, people meet."" hopeful people smart decisions giving false hope concern.

Fall/winter season prime time flu spreading colds viruses. became October, delta variant still spreading, many needing booster soon, let alone many still unvaccinated. 

Get vaccinated, take precautions meeting family, hang large groups 2 weeks prior family meeting. know Covid still much gone. Please approve vaccine children FDA Actually, guy vaxxed co-morbidities. happen. Really rare far know? Sure. blanket statement one fully vaxxed dies. going YouTube videos, hope time. also publicly calling Pfizer hurry submit request EUA kids 12 supposedly coming end September. moving goalposts. matter ""original purpose"" was. matters Delta, lot conversations, headlines, etc. clearly referenced efficacy infection. Hell even guidance abandon masks originally based exactly premise. Vaccinated people getting infections, spreading virus. Delta clearly changed things.

You're disingenuous, ""original intent"".  Okay, thank you. mom really hard time getting appointments general practitioners, since area bit flooded right cases. That's good know FDA discussing mixing vaccines month. I'm using excuse got in-laws year. can't believe 18 months thing virtually public health officials willing talk ""masking"" broadest, reductive manichean terms. wearing 2 ply cloth mask even remotely plane efficacy wearing N95 even KN95 respirator, ESPECIALLY w/r/t delta, pointing evidently anti-masker heresy  don't. Also, think ""grief"" proper term emotion feeling. probably obsessed schools.

It takes special kind stupid go school whatever reason there's pandemic kind. Even somebody tells to. lot people vaccinated, ones hold large gatherings tend people. 

IF want hold large gatherings Christmas 

THEN tend unvaccinated? 


Vaccinated people hold size gathering please, 18 plus months social distancing, mask wearing, missing birthdays holidays. However, Gottlieb said Americans assess individual situations use tools Covid testing create safe environment.

That’s important caveat headline. 

Honestly, I’m sure extended family would even consent testing. course. let tell you. vaccinated Moderna fully April. Right entire house covid. partner fully vaxxed completely asymptomatic. kids slight fever generally unwell. glad it, could different outcome. this!  I'm worried vaccinated people hospital. going listen fauci narcissistic. 

“I’M ONE MATTERS! Me.  MEEEEEE!” Listen, vaccinated, holidays. Statements like makes anti-vaxxers believe right. Australia well collectively. states putting Delta popped across country. pretty much agreement needed stopped possible high vaccination rates.

Pretty much every state went snap lockdowns case two appeared snuffed emerging clusters. 

Then appeared New South Wales Sydney local state government prided ""different"" premier refused weeks even say word lockdown assured everyone nothing would fine. fine, got control inflections appeared country Sydney New Zealand well. 

Melbourne dealing large outbreak several clusters formed people Sydney. NSW premier deputy resigned premier investigated corruption. Part thinks running away fucking entire countries collective effort feed ego.

I nite still several states major cities Australia still covid free controlled Delta outbreaks. Melbourne Sydney going outbreaks now. plan open vaccination rates get 80+% coming weeks.

Lockdowns work extremely early obviously enough people need comply.

Don't even get started federal government's complete failure secure enough vaccine. Still supply issues even now. Pfizer offered 40 million doses Australian government mid last year rejected local pharma firm ex-party members board.

We pretty much vaccinated time Delta arrived barely started.  ""I care happens me"" Israeli data could skewed excludes asymptomatic milder infections, there’s also question immunity measured, tests looking things like antibody titers spike protein vaccines look effective could antibodies viral epitopes weren’t measured. Yes child yet eligible vaccine prayer 🙏 family Yeah, lol. I'm fully vaccinated, family members. We're gathering meet, like we've since got vaxxed. He's nuts thinks anyone taking advice anymore Updated post. started looking case numbers Delta started raging. started wearing masks again. cancelled first plans made large gathering events since lockdown began March 2020. I'm fully vaccinated like take unnecessary risks. I'm visiting friends family again, I'm still cautious large gatherings. I'm watching peak drops off. I'll comfortable holiday plans get booster shot numbers stay down. Best case scenario: Delta COVID's last ditch effort we're now. But, like Fauci says, soon tell. Awesome, virus good job! Well depends loved ones already vaccinated ok , family expend entire day watching Fox news, wear red caps could possibly involved insurrection/ coup attempt. may want hold invite over. able travel already hospital ward. I'm also worried anti-vaxxer friends see news like yet another reason children vaccinated. going anyway, shake ""your beloved New York Times says so!"" face. That's risk aversion. Lots people things. got vaccinated. risk death hospitalization low. people worried getting sick while. point know anyone unaware infected vaccination. people care. risk sick days outweigh desire things. seems understand basically everyone country thinks this. whole country entirely open lol. There’s reason even contemplate gathering family point   post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That’s good still important part, prevent severe illness used following numbers Georgia statistics website (ending 9/28).

(A) % deaths unvaccinated = 0.164%

(B) % deaths vaccinated = 0.0113%

(C) Number fully vaccinated United States currently 185,492,579

If take C x (303,473) substract C x B (20,925) get approximate number people avoided death vaccinated (282,548). Exact right mentality.   would define highly effective? really isn't. cat bag. Covid going get eradicated current vaccines. certainly lessen impact, individual collective level - 0 deaths table foreseeable future. 

Don't take vaccination saying pointless. I'm trying make sure spreading realistic expectations. go around saying vaccine protect everyone perfectly, vaccinated people [continue to] die - credibility becomes problem. need set expectations appropriately. Yeah well known bars weekend Boston, ONE wearing mask past bouncer. 

Honestly nonsense mandate reason Janey even make top three primary. Good riddance. That’s Fauci’s point, fwiw. “We've got concentrate continuing get numbers try jump ahead weeks months say we're going particular time,” Fauci told ""Face Nation. “Let's focus like laser continuing get cases down. people getting vaccinated also situation boosters appropriate get people boosted.” people gotten reinfected Delta variant they've either died worse reactions

uh think we're gonna need kinda citation one Gee wonder vaccine hesitant people aren’t changing minds? Maybe “experts” saying touch garbage like this. simply “if you’re vaccinated, enjoy holidays, not, know risks now.” feel bad anyone still listens guy says going end zoom Christmas fully vaccinated family name “trusting science” joke vaccinated sure Yeah I’m getting tired this. I’m vaccinated, I’ll get booster I’m able, family wants vaccine gotten it. I’m seeing them. can’t keep this. It’s almost two years. He's justifiably cautious given many times he's attacked situation changed position changed (as should). there's new, highly vaccine-resistant variant running rampant Christmas? ""Too soon tell"" telling people ""no,"" trying boxed premature statement. circumstances remain similar know, I'm sure he'll okay vaccinated people traveling Christmas, probably urge extra caution young kids can't vaccinated yet. feels like reporter fishing headline make look bad. seems unable answer types questions without getting quote mangled. 

He needed PR machine start here. A. say recommended it. said make call yet. getting worked nothing.

Also show proper respect deserves calling Dr Fauci- he's talking giving advice pandemic, something qualified fields study career, guy talking bar.

Immunocompromised children also kept school many cases, well many children disabilities. people, pandemic much over, whether want not.  So, given rare ""vaccine-caused myocarditis"" is, chances actually mild Covid causing myocarditis recently vaccinated people? remember looking US whole hide social distancing wins. summer people south indoors due heat, folks north outside distanced. Currently sweet period folks outside distanced. Numbers increase northern states gets cold. difference is, trust neighbor, friends, politicians ""research"" health decisions, trust doctor, scientist, overall scientific consensus comes heath decisions family. Theres huge difference, still respect value expertise, not. Please tell what’s point missed? seems YOU’VE missed point. People can’t risk averse unless understand risk. Instead understanding risk, people simply ignore data don’t like pretend doesn’t exist. 

I’ve personally watched bubble risk-averse, pro-vaccine, pro-mask, pro-distancing individuals completely 180° year. They’ve stopped reading news. They’ve stopped reading guidelines. They’ve stopped checking number cases area. They’ve stopped wearing masks. They’ve stopped washing fucking hands, dude. got COVID one other, shocked pikachu face said “I don’t know got this!”

It’s risk-aversion. It’s willful ignorance. Well, make majority, seems like means free whatever want without worry backlash. Thank you. Imagine ignorant, believe bad things happen happen you.   lot baseless assertions, pool unvaccinated PHDs surprisingly high demographic, still healthcare workers went school practice medicine. whole point flies face “only idiots getting vaccinated” multitude reasons one wouldn’t get vaccinated, young, healthy pre existing risk factors already fought virus, many educated informed people could understandably draw conclusion trying deny anyone’s right vaccination need risk (elderly/obese) get vaccinated, submitting proper masking testing prevent spreading infection public sphere  absolutely, pretty much experience well. know small minority people who, still vaccinated, things like come dinner, socialize outdoors, run jog masks, etc. feel like group people simultaneously ones take admonitions family gatherings seriously also ones need hear + act least. people, incidentally, absolutely want hear much science changed past \~5 months: cloth mask slightly better wearing nothing all, ""6ft distance"" thing pretty well completely meaningless face aerosolized virus One year you’ll saying “it still sucks, it’s better 2021, keep trying, maybe 2022 normal holiday season” every country failed though. china maintaining zero covid. Florida. take Covid seriously. best friend died Covid. I’m traumatized. family friends vaccinated except littles. Life back normal. starting gymnastics (with precautions). go out. went Halloween horror nights (with mask) blast. It’s time move forward. can’t trapped house anymore. got Covid last year sick months spent much time alone house. can’t again. worried getting covid getting never really thought long term side effects would go through. one knows extent long last things surface later. know lucky that’s heart breaking see everyone come brain fog can’t imagine 7 year old trying learn read write brain fog barely hold conversation times.  number good skewed. biggest increases May-Sept south. know hot people go inside, numbers higher. sweet middle ground people distanced outside, rapid increase cools northern folk go inside. Compliance non-existent Somerville restaurants, though many Cambridge restaurants still strictly enforcing. People already questioned purpose making indoor diners wear masks first 5-10 minutes there. even people progressive parts Greater Boston done rule restaurants.

I went Lucky Strike (for non-locals, bar, bowling alley, arcade). one wearing masks, even didn’t drink. Enforcement non-existent passed bouncer.

Medford mask mandate, seen almost 0 compliance across board. Even staff gyms, restaurants, barbers, etc wearing them, they’re plain view street anyone see. 

People clearly done mandates, patrons business owners included. Compliance tanking outside hospitals grocery stores. vaccination rates cities high, people fed up. really unbelievable common cite statistics like things like ""only 0.001% vaccinated people died Covid."" Even CDC state health governments guilty pushing statistics like these, sound good basically meaningless. feels especially shady unlike journalists, people presumably understand basic statistics know numbers little substance, choose push anyways sound good. IMO ultimately counterproductive fuels antivax conspiracy theories CDC maliciously manipulating narrative. Especially Boston. PR 101 would genius scientist well. knowledge world subject doesn’t know properly convey anything.   states, 911 exists right man. could died dragging hospital.  neighbor's family got COVID let kids run around playing outside whole time. Infuriating. Thanks clarification. something experience prior, sure caught surprise.

Hope right researchers find answers.  acting nothing going on

There's problem right there. Wishing things normal obtaining earned normalcy. We're still averaging well 100k cases 2k deaths per day people acting nothing going on. That's terrible. one thing take risk yourself, adult. Children deserve protection. hope niece improves soon.  KiDs GeT cOvId.
I hate idiots making pandemic much worse could been. That’s fine, also define permanent brain fog serious illness CDC not. Plus, transmissibility based infection, serious illness death. still consider important end goal preventing serious illness. repeat talking points want understand intentions behind it, completely disregarding infection rate input probability serious illness reasonable person’s definition negligent best. anti-vax acquaintance recently tell ""covid killed kids"". pointed that's true small number killed, pivoted ""well okay, small number, co-morbidities"".

Basically that's saying ""oh, kids kinda sick already, count"". Fucking sickening! human beings. Little vulnerable humans starting lives that! like kid's family, families friends devastated deaths! One child death covid one many.  Glad kids there's way fuck I'd sending school mess. I'd probably psych ward somewhere now, honestly. 

This ""in-person learning costs"" shit disgusting. Biden's better Trump regard. Sorry comment ""political"" also reality. Kids dying &amp; developing lifelong complications &amp; people acting like time take masks &amp; go football games, homecoming, parent-teacher conferences, etc. kids school, mandated state mandated person lot places. ""Little Suzy, go see 1000 kids school every day, can't see Grandma Grandpa Big Tony says so"". see logic. that, (at least United States) plenty people intentionally make point set attend large family outing spite exact opposite Fauci CDC says. wish kidding. lol fuckin exactly. 100K people pack shoulder shoulder watch football, get within 6ft grandma 74 countries deaths per million thousand. NZ 5/1,000,000 grand total 27 deaths.

There probably bunch things could done better depending viewpoints. always is.

But 27 deaths bugger lockdowns compared rest world still going medal performance. catch decent death rate of, say, 5000 total equal sort average country? doubt it.

For negative opinions regarding NZ situation pretty much nullifies them; think lives actually pretty important living without lockdowns would nice too.

For opinions regarding transparency etc look well worked countries (with without transparancy). Basically individual humans seem pretty shit following rules save people individual -really- wants something rules. 

Tell people ""you need mask"" omit ""because important enough; enough medical people"" get thrown face forever knowing anything. Tell truth time? hah.

Tell people ""wear mask"" get pissy desire make choice.

No government snowball hell's chance getting right. better longer. West Australia closed borders 3 cases yesterday everyone wants open borders. UK made chance using vaccines holding back second doses. Australia made chance making locally. One got lucky, one got shafted. Could gone way; fact basis work really.

It's easy sit sidelines criticise guess. Okay, I'm misinformed. one question. American I'm Canadian, assume guys similar rule. enroll child school, require proof vaccination, without admitted. Draconian mandate?

And number healthcare workers PhDs small percentage total healthcare workers + PhDs. nurses medical staff, real doctors. scientific method requires consensus things multiple studies verifying hypothesis, cuz trust single scientist, doctor, etc single source truth. even studies showing soul leaves body death, reason they're trusted method completely flawed (I've read couple papers). basically get someone passes fucking exams goes become doctor/engineer without really grasping concepts. uh... no. live midwest generally living normal life since vaccine #2, go get booster next week. Ohio handled things pretty shittily things concerned, overwhelming majority people pretty much acting nothing going on, ""reward good behavior"" means. There’s also problem vaccines improperly administered mass scale, literally recommends aspirating shot that’s way guarantee Intramuscular injection vs intravenous injection, manufacturers explicitly recommend administering vaccines cause acute myocarditis pericarditis dangerous heart conditions. also don’t know kind long term neurological effects vaccines may pose people told effects would appeared even though SPARS pandemic simulation John Hopkins Institute 2017 page 60-61 explicitly predicted neurological side effects potentially showing 2-4 years later vaccination. suppose believe scientists experts conducted simulation 4-5 years ago misinformed? Didn’t know talking about? 100% do, think people overestimating many parents going rush get young kids vaccinated. 25-50% kids end getting vaccinated?

I said comment above, know 2 families still keeping young kids home. parents know taking kids vacations, letting hang friends time etc. 

My co-worker 7 year old hasn’t done anything except go school since started, lives town strict pandemic precautions. said gets upset time because, school year especially, friends school always talking fun things they’re friends/sports, going etc. he’s allowed go anywhere weekends. use example because, see around me, even lot parents unvaccinated kids resuming normal life. Go thru process? cohort study included double vaccinated Pf Moderna CMS patients. ~2.7m Moderna This, exactly!

I may gather family ( town ) know vaccination status, planning indoor Xmas party Boy Scout Troop families. going large corporate Xmas events either ( though doubt either company one wife works ).   create post them. know they're lost. family way. We’re waiting see little kids family get vaxxed too, they’re vaxxed Christmas, that’s enough me.   comedically touch. job recommend best practices. know people listen, sets floor bad decision making.

Example: lot people drive 5 miles speed limit. speed limit raised, people start driving 5 miles new limit? get vaccinated can’t around vaccinated people?

Hang on, lemme go ask Delta it’ll leave give us back Alpha can—wait…hang on—okay Delta says “no”, it’s gonna stick around bit. 

Circumstances change. get vaccinated reason, it’s less effective that’s way things are.  There's large demographic people country trip dicks grifted. There's point figure age demographics health conditions presented. people healthy youngsters opposite? here, joke, keep mind CDCs joke. literally CDC guideline exposure. think people realize that. powers done risk vs. economic impact calculus long time ago.   tl;dr: extremely rare never life-threatening. Non-issue. headline 100% accurate. wanted refer 4M person area, would said ""Boston region"" ""greater Boston"". ""Boston"" refers within city limits Boston, population less 700,000. Anti-vax types going keep kicking road new argument. ones try couch anti-intellectualism sort ""rationality"" opposed ""vaccines edit God DNA"" argument always run hide behind another smokescreen. 

I'm old enough remember ""I want fully FDA approved"" nonsense. NBA criteria religious exemption?  cities still mandates public
indoor places, including Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, Newton, Watertown, Arlington, Medford.

But highly doubt people avoid gathering holidays. people taking antivaxxers word full approval mattering. ill conceived bargaining strategy. One that's still going 12-15s schools.

Legally, vaccine EUA mandated. Arguments otherwise frivolous they're laughed court even ...dextro-wing.. judges. deaths concentrated elderly. african countries much much younger. probably less obesity well developed nations.

and yea undercounting probably big factor too.  Y’all keep complaining messaging … 

Literally nobody said anything Christmas, even Fauci. vulnerable boosted, school aged kids vaxxed. People already done this. want public trust need this. human factors hire would work wonders CDC.    agree could messaged better, also often wonder protect young children able vaccinate yet. saw school year started disaster.

I think entire family vaccinated feel fine, probably okay gather (not accounting breakthrough cases). know family, 5 year old compromised immune system, we're still going sheltering place he's safe. worries wrong. vaccination rates much lower near beginning year skewed little bit.  It’s way common covid  completely overrun hospitals? yes, get vaccination level up, quick. Agreed there's time place even best puns. Might someone's posting family death paralysis.

RIP aunt. frustration people still trusting disease instead doctor severe... know intubation would cause atrophy, gosh, rough. Hope taking care right now. many people put pedestal. amount people Reddit pretend vaccine either exist anything astounding. see ever thread covid, matter sub. meant commenter Fauci. Fauci said family vaccinated safe booking plans great holiday! Large parts Africa still unvaccinated still places new variants originate. I’m getting booster shot Tuesday. I’m going go ahead plan post-Covid life two weeks Welcome yearly vaccines like get flu.   Good point, specifically trying show vaccines worked exactly expected (match trial results). response arguments I've seen recently vaccines work told. EXACTLY!  parent, hate seeing article written.

Saying kid underlying condition acceptable reason society go, sad best move on.

It seems every article read included honestly feel offended parents. qualifies underlying condition first place? see frkm picture kid got life taken away due selfish behavior adults. True, could enforced isolated lockdown people coming back country. Harsh, would helped transmission.  also seem completely missed point almost certainty extremely risk averse yourself.

What point? say, exactly, disagree with? Please specific. hope guys get sick. whoa - cannot say effectively zero risk vaccine kids. know impact X dosage would elementary school aged child They're trying obfuscate waning effectiveness vaccines. That's started using weird, misleading stats, concerns waning effectiveness started coming up. Need admit 3 shot protocol begin get everyone booster. Easy: speed limit raised whatever current wink wink nudge nudge limit enforced limit. EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE - wanting hold months vaccinating 5 yr old available unvaccinated father law died September. child vaccinated asap. got booster side effects pretty much 2nd dose. US cases dropping despite really restrictions all.   tragedy every parent's worst nightmare. However, silver lining story remarkable rare. Take precautions, keep family children safe freak it. Yeah, no. agree decision 100%. I'm sorry son, cuts deep I'm even parents. don’t really see point restrictions don’t want vaccinate Yet full stadiums ok?!? rough smart. I'd love see States. young, healthy, vaccinated covid currently significant risk.   …that vaccine for. Easy fix- act like it’s complicated lol… vaccinated gather safely, don’t recommend unvaccinated people gather situation without masks. Boom done completely right. totally misunderstood thought shooting wedding. I'll delete comment.    know. Johnson Johnson might outlier, regard. I'm sure companies (and much public) would like could get boosters, going end policy decision. parent anything less 100% fucking scary. 

Right? understand parents flippant COVID. kid bad RSV infant, nebulizer daily, perfectly healthy I'm petrified getting Covid. 

They really good mask social distancing e explained could susceptible friends. 

They nearly 11 living Florida I'm getting close considering saying 12 really need vaccine  Thx still think so. worse tho. Lots fruits tasted like marrow. That's gone now. Yeah it’s quite interesting. (am?) least somewhat germaphobe covid got busted friends family time washing hands like crazy, worrying people sick around me, opening doors paper towel flu season, etc.

But somehow along way covid lot people lapped me. still take reasonable precautions open doors paper towels avoid sick people whenever can? doubt that’s ever going away me. post-vaccine society, we’ve given enough time we’re never getting back live like isolated hermits miss life longer. F that.  get kids' dose approved, we're probably going home. keep kids safe part making sure deal idea may killed great grandma... watches much fox news get vaccinated if/when dies covid completely fox news' fault. brought school, kids understand that. They'd see covid great grandma died. GODDAMNIT I'm angry.   family fully vaccinated (Pfizer + boosters). Urgent Care worker Florida. I'm fully vaccinated, intent get Moderna booster available. *I plans fly NY see family, would even consider it.* 

Imagine...An Urgent Care worker (high degree potential exposure), catching Uber bus airport (potential exposure) getting plane (potential exposure), taking taxi Mom's house (potential exposure). 

Mom turning 78 year. brother 55, wife 54. uncle might there: 74. high-risk groups. close family left.

Not worth risking lives. Nope. sad conclusion I've come well. take comfort fact people nationwide happy take shot. first thought ones still holding run mill oddballs- conspiracy theorists, religious zealots, people tied ""freedom"" team politics...but turns way dismissive. data personal experience shows antivaxx group fact filled lots folks would consider ""normal""- every way. young, educated, suburbanites. pretty much otherwise logical people...who willfully ignorant issue seek every opportunity rationalize it. make sense me, continue puzzle it. Great evidence mandates fail understand relatively rich country like US high death count, whereas countries like India entire continent Africa, much lower death counts (yes, even accounting government undercounting India factor 10).

Can someone help understand this?  close going get  top cabinet official Monday criticized country's stalling vaccination rates failing slow spread Covid-19 Russians die numbers seen since start pandemic. 
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said health officials made easy people across country’s 11 time zones get Covid jab medication. 
“But **vaccination level insufficient stop spread infection**,” Mishustin said Covid task force meeting. 
He added government “seriously concerned” spike infections. 
“**Morbidity increasing Russian regions. twice many patients hospitals time last year**,” Mishustin said. 
Russia approved least five Covid-19 vaccines, developed domestically. vaccination drive stalled 36% adult population, according independent Gogov monitor gathers regional data. 
Russia reported **record high numbers coronavirus deaths five past six days**, all-time record 890 Covid-19 fatalities reported Sunday. Monday, government tally reported third-highest number daily Covid cases since start 2021. 
In Moscow, epicenter pandemic within Russia, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said **infections risen 30% hospitalizations 20% past week alone.** 
Anxiety resurgent virus display news agencies covering Monday’s task force meeting initially reported officials canceled mass events Russia.  
Rospotrebnadzor, consumer-protection watchdog oversees national coronavirus response effort, said later ban gatherings 3,000 people already place across 85 Russian regions. 
The Kremlin urged regional leaders take steps slow spread, stopping short **indicating planning reimpose national-level restrictions.** 


Low level vaccination. Already levels daily new cases seen peak 6 months ago. Setting new records daily deaths. 


New restrictions coming.  say everyone vaccinated absolutely safe people making plans great holiday! vaccinated recommend going, understand people still will, try increase ventilation can. move piss everyone off, vaccinated not. certainty unless make mandatory. people stubborn, Covid might turn unkillable flu. poor person :( hope comes back you. suchhhh exaggeration, permanent Brain fog! Sure, maybe like 5% 1%? reality probably able make neutralizing vaccine. vaccines illnesses don’t mutate, flu vaccine isn’t extremely effective mutates, much like coronaviruses, though much slowly. can’t antibodies permanently bodies, would turn blood sludge. really matters T-cells ability remember make new antibodies. truth is, eventually get Covid.  messaging, tho? Current guidelines haven’t changed, Fauci contradicted them. … ??

From “We’ve got concentrate continuing get numbers try jump ahead weeks months say we’re going particular time,” Fauci told *Face Nation*. “Let’s focus like laser continuing get cases down. people getting vaccinated also situation boosters appropriate get people boosted.”

Like, that’s legit good advice, imho. child enrollment parent right home school child, fundamentally different requiring vaccination engage aspects society, particularly traveling across country. whole point requiring testing masks actually work effective false security people fed vaccinated. Besides you’re comparing vaccines diseases extremely high morbidity decades research potential side effects vs extremely young vaccine short term effectiveness disease far shown specific risk factors hospitalization. It’s fair comparison, don’t require kids show proof vaccination traveling entering store clear, accessible alternatives public schooling data in, sooner kids get vaccines better we'll be. meeting right now? I’m sure Christmas. 1 year old highly doubt able vaccinated then. also 5 year old nephew school. Right unvaccinated family members. 
I really hope 5-11 group able get vaccinated soon! awful getting together last year, didn’t want risk then-3 month old. 

That said- wasn’t kid, would business usual here. I’m pretty sure people either vaccinated DGAF anyways. People made minds up. waiting kiddos… tbh, great business opportunity... explains QVC teleshopping businesses still business, well MLMs. think misunderstood saying. going event choice purchased ticket for. Everyone else going event going choice well (its performance). event requiring everyone fully vaccinated, show proof vaccination, one 12 allowed in, still wear masks times inside building. masking part made aware people buying tickets tickets sold. using profession example type thing happening anywhere private events. right, aunt's cousin's friend's dog said got COVID lost 50% lung capacity almost taste Marlboros again. world's leading scientists liars grifters. 90% adults protection (fully vaxxed natural infection) soon 12 eligible vaccine. hard imagine another major wave. Maybe small one around holidays, probably another large one.  extremely sad. also unfair adults refuse preventative treatment resulted medical staff make decisions. unfair people died unrelated Covid19 ICU ER full unvaccinated individuals. got bad Florida nearly ran oxygen hospitals. Hospital resources finite unfortunately we're point need conservative care.   Possibly there's harm getting vaccinated too. like dumbest thing lose job over. I’ve gathering like 8 months family pretty much dead. But, wife's family mostly intact. WOULD go see last time wife talked mom hung up, mom told ""expose kids C help immune system"". wife told stop talking, kept talking, wife hung her. Now, get this, mom MD.  right. young think invincible!  Seriously. I'm holding breath 5-11 age group vaccine roll 6 year old, even longer 3 year old. cannot imagine family feels. I'm 30 long covid year, feel you.   Well, saw increase summer, agree, given availability vaccine fact that’s it’s completely free, vaccination rates could’ve better. Quick sideline here.. wonder long make conversational acronyms.. iykwim.. ""whathaphuck *this* one now""

Bigijaootttintpmat

But guess one things need pay attention ... FAR

We've still got ways go. think could break 850k mid January, maybe more. CDC needs get head ass realize nobody gives fuck year. us vaccinated. realistic recommendations like: Recommending family members get vaccinated staying home exhibiting symptoms. virtual Christmas Thanksgiving second year row. CDC loses credibility public.  Okay mistake I'm trying use fact in-laws unvaccinated excuse attend large family gathering. far winning since vaccinated. really gullible believe everything fauci says. 
Fauci wants families fully vaccinated safe, especially they’re traveling. That’s kinda entire point, fwiw. 

All scare-mongering holiday travel *three months now* baseless. Nobody said fully vaccinated people can’t shouldn’t visit family. Same. received J&amp;J shot March. get Pfizer vaccine mRNA 2-shot? 
it's 8 months since. Nothing going convince anti-vaxxers anything reasonable, can't stop reporting 107k Cases 1,800 Deaths per day US feed sentiment.

US Deaths early October 2020 700. We're 2.5x today. Without significant increase vaccinations and/or precautions, likely get worse winter. Fauci say ""don't worry, everything fine"" appease anti-vaxxers?  earth would that? Imagine foreign entity destroyed Boston. They'd foaming mouth demanding justice. virus it, collective reaction ""meh."" 

It's like imagination even envision immune system virus even works. never able understand brains see world.  I’m seeing family holidays unless there’s big surge delta cases. We’re fully vaccinated immune compromised elderly got booster. We’ve done part. We’re even bringing home tests case. sucks us complied beginning still deal consequences due unvaccinated anti vax. Selfish, elitist moron. thinks shitty self. thought might infected &amp; infect goes world, unvaccinated. Again. PIG. Article say anything christmas Lol @ thinking anyone stayed away families last year. think message intended people really want avoid getting covid. someone vaxxed much issue, need take advice. 

He forcing anyone something. like him? listen him. know quite Fauci haters dead now, way. stating facts. great advice. Problem laws won’t take still think Covid hoax. gearing drama last Christmas refused see them. really loosing believers everyday. blatant hypocrisy what's safe absolutely ridiculous. 100,000 complete strangers FB game? GREAT!! like, 12 people Christmas? Probably not... We'll see...

You gullible feckless moron still loyal fauci fan. beginning important. thing well controlled point, plus vaccines??? guy still even talking? blueprint solve this. Russia roll vaccine year ago? Buttholes think Americans actually gonna listen? Lol   *sure* can't qualify without lying?

BMI 25+ 74% population... 6' tall man weighing 184 qualifies.

Current former smoker

High blood pressure

Asthma

Diabetes (all types)

Substance use disorder, including smoking pot binge drinking.

Those cover huge swathe population... qualify none (or serious/less common ones) *and* work job involving interacting lot people.

I can't imagine many people meeting *something* list. Obviously subjective.. context, argument made 0.1% considered ""highly"" effective.

And again, I'm looking anything, pointing killed argument omitting word ""highly"" first comment.  Yeah, Tom coming back town! never masked. older niece refused wear beginning one ever made her. father an""unmask children asshole"". Unvaccinated well, though eligible. friends vaccinated either, unfortunately.

Luckily, younger niece common sense. Yeah. 13yo mild breakthrough cases. got 9yo. I'm super thankful little guy asymptomatic he's young get vaccinated.

I'm thinking becomes easier get breakthrough case exposed unvaccinated delta carrier. Still far, far better raw dogging virus without vax happens. Literally, ""If look history ... different surges we've had, come up, start come sudden boom, come back again,"" [Fauci] said. ""As coming down, within capability, make happen. Namely go very, low level, vaccination mitigation.""  vaccine keep hospital , keep getting infected.    Everyone wants know future far out. snow Northern IL Christmas? know. single storm 15+"" snow winter? know either. putting snow tires car colder. Yes!

So Dr. Fauci basically saying put odds favor safe holiday gatherings getting vaccinated wearing masks recommended. *you're mean one...mr grinch* able vaccinated 3.3x many people give third doses later ""better"". vaccination card cases sentenced still waiting go trial? I'm curious harshly sentences actually be. really appreciate analogy   I'm pretty sure concerned high survival rate happen them. I’ve attended weekly, full college football games. Everywhere go, masks barely present. haven’t caught covid, every flu present college lol. 

Honestly, feel like life normal already. really depends want live now. guess replenishing heathy supply helper B cells smart vaccinated work... Makes sense me.  definitely great way get Americans get vaccinated back normal…   Walmart asked qualified said yes. prove it. agree. he's saying he's going forecast months ahead reasonable. husband already said we're making commitment holidays closer time. knows things look month half two months time. elections Russia rigged. care popularity. needs keep oligarchs happy replace him. we’re vaccinated? Got booster yesterday. Everyone reacts differently. fever. chills, headache multiple joint pain. go away day. like 2nd dose.   we, know better.   Fauci get fucked point, mad respect guy overstayed welcome. imo, vaccinating rates never ok. summer rate, Russia enough vaccinated next summer. 30% fully vaccinated. 


My guess wanted / needed QR codes already got summer. point say, ”we’ll seeing another covid surge among unvaxxed Christmas New Years holidays.” live Indiana maddening little here. Holcomb going way kill everybody like DeSantis Abbot, time he's anything help people either. incredibly silent ever since lifted mandatory mask mandate March 6th. incredibly sad disheartening especially look states like CA NY doing. matter says, morons gonna moron. Period. would agree anyone going rough emotional time instantly vulnerable. think humans less smart individuals thought were. make better decisions collectively sometimes communities collectively make bad decisions best intents, even full information. harder us want admit, go groupthink. often confident enough override individual instincts challenge authority, example -- Milgram experiment one keep coming back to. Ya'll can't help you? He's wrong, also great advice follow problem become bigger problem fact. point don’t see anything changing minds adults refused. dad 3 co-workers quit company announced mandate.  keep saying well- though irrational resistance idea quarters, incontrovertible. I'm vax'd. entire family vax'd. meeting xmas. seen almost 2 years. us seen 5+ years due location.

We going groups anything, chillin house. meeting up.  Saved lunch time. Good luck that, since convinced population vaccines bad doubt get far. idiots say, ""See Dr. Fauci said gathering family Christmas perfectly safe."" 

Because people need hear message mitigating risks etc, comprehend risk. live binary world good/bad shades grey. They'll whatever want, Dr. Fauci damned do, damned situation.  There’s fair bit circumstantial evidence China’s lock downs we’re nearly effective China said were.

Frankly I’ve got bridges sell anyone take China’s numbers face value. Going depend details, talk multiple doctors. confidence aren’t going saying every year on. Nuance lost people. Vaccines work. 100%

Precautions helpful especially community spread high. people vaccinated community spread would much lower, risk vaccinated would near zero.  eh, say rare.. I'm seeing many cases around here. get much milder cases thankfully several week hospitalized.  Testing harder get, bet lot vaccinated mild cases bother getting tested.   Gottlieb one experts regularly get interviewed understands anything regular people behave.  mixing neurological side effects first shot lasted 4+ weeks? That’s asking about. Thanks much! agree this. absolutist view ""people gather"" wrong. 

* people gather.
* people gather smaller groups.
* people gather.

""Not everyone follow advice, therefore point offering advice"" understandable point view given badly American people performed pandemic; accurate.  80% population vaccinated? bit high. He’s going say every year on, it’s going another default public health advisory nobody actually adhere to. Boston small area, many places people outside region assume part Boston, like Harvard, MIT, etc, actually part city proper. people area mentally include Cambridge, Somerville, Brookline, MAYBE Newton, Watertown, Medford “urban” part city, many many towns encircled rt 128 “metro” area. point *everyone* needs vaccinated, worldwide. includes stupid antivaxxers US. inclusive, exclusive. lmao obscene amount people don’t understand one something doesn’t mean should. countries mixed brands fine.

See 100k people packing shoulder shoulder watch football mean people that. Hospitals still flooded Covid cases clear indication large gatherings vaccinated, ""vaccinated"", otherwise, terrible idea right now.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lose antibodies T-cells make fight off. feel like shit week. high-risk 3-year-old, I’m right you. We’re thinking providing rapid tests everyone gathering, try keep daughter safe. 

People empathy anymore. doesn’t directly affect them, doesn’t exist doesn’t matter. 

Love username btw, Wire amazing. hospitals areas US low vaccination rates, worse last year. example, last week reported largest hospital Montana 150% capacity. rural state like Montana, that's huge problem major hospital overflow little rural hospitals. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most US seeing higher case counts deaths time last year. vaccine works people take it. Wearing mask normal though. minuscule number adults/kids “can’t” vaccinated. … aren’t problem. 

Tens millions adults still refuse get vaccinated, 42 million kids aren’t yet able be. literally live state hospitals ICUs aren’t anywhere close capacity. data state confirms it, recently spoke hospital worker said they’re much better vaccines. vaccine caused myocarditis, covid would caused 10-20x worse got vaccine.  someone cancel Thanksgiving?   MARGARET BRENNAN: gather Christmas, soon tell. DR. FAUCI: know, MARGARET, soon tell.  I've opposed covid vaccine data it, ""one fucking idiots"", sorry!

Caveat: Specifically Pfizer Moderna. know vaccines work. live highly vaccinated area, want Fauci encourage holiday travel, bringing lots unvaccinated people area? point discouraging holiday travel contain outbreaks. There's solid data mild moderate breakthrough cases there? last read, CDC released that. selfless perspective means fewer overall deaths. selfish perspective means fewer mutations virus would ultimately benefit us long run.

There paper (authors actually podcast well) confirmed week virology (don't actual episode handy) using modeling. problem is, people short sighted selfish actually straight said ""look, booster help short run, helps us longer run"" people would probably go anyways (except antivaxxers who, course would say SEEE! WORK LIEEESSSSSS!).

Overall given choices... I'm ok going route, though I'm also fairly sure I'm going get booster soon they're approved (moderna).  I’d read that. depends much opportunity give virus mutate. 

“emergence escape mutants somewhat less likely Delta variant wild type… small set escape-enhancing mutations already identified wild type likely include majority possible mutations effect.” stupidity wanting admit facts contradict delusions contradict cult. co-worker (blatant Trump cultist science denier) whose mother got covid. hospitalized like 2 months, almost died repeatedly re-admitted several times. 

A week hospital claiming mother get Covid ""got double pneumonia"". people view admitting facts betrayal cult.  Yeah kid likely took masks, blaming though. Unless kids wearing thin ones. I’ve sat next students turn positive later day I’m still negative thanks surgical masks.  volunteered stay home order take care social family members’ estates, land funeral arrangements holidays. gave RA said getting family holidays. Smh. scientific data says you’re state shit together got vaccinated hospitalizations aren’t danger overwhelming healthcare system. Though I’m sure whole country good goalpost moved citing pandemic still bad countries therefore can’t resume normalcy. should. Two years long. I’m young, voted biden, vaccinated. cared far long. downvote reality majority. time start planning normal means  Bro, people still last year without vaccine got em think they're gonna? Smdh y'all, free point. Please take care wear ya masks get vaccinated haven't! Please explain committed mass murder.  Different people different time frames. way safer increase days wait number tests. 
Here's study related that. AFAIK people wit CT 35 unlikely transmit. 

[Virological serological kinetics SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant vaccine-breakthrough infections: multi-center cohort  True, always few. virus needs feed, sacrifice. American patriot way. sister law, sure, don’t know anybody. Also never mind fact current hospitalizations less 1/5 state’s peak weren’t even capacity back then. Trust me, it’s gotten worse. Personal attacks get ignored, literal facts stats get removed.   Same. went football game. Im vaccinated fun now. fair said ""too soon tell.""

Given quickly situation evolve absolutely prudent say, ""we know, Thanksgiving 52 days Christmas 82 days away. know get closer dates.""

I would shocked alarmed gave specific guidance _in either_ direction early. need research figure looks like.

Well, remember part saying needed someone hold hand thought going die breathe? getting vaccine - that's looks like. information need nearly dying. Hey now. didn’t think coming coddling anti-vaxxers. pointing feel speaking void people message meant listening haven’t time. Enjoy visit them! think know one person IRL wouldn’t go.  not. fuck anyone think going change? gather Christmas. holiday ever again. never able live life ever We're risk still high I'll attending via Zoom double-masked distanced.

dude.... got married recently 100 people. One pregnant woman wore mask literally one else did. Basically everyone vaccinated except couple people temperature checks left masks wanted them, don’t think pack even opened lol. People done masks. definitely tired hours vaccine slept 12 hours night. However side effects JJ worse lasted days. yeah, sounds good! Get extra protection!  get third shot take care man. Personal spoiler: worth aggravation gather holidays. almost Dr. Fauci write stupid headline. Oh well, reading actual article, tradition old internet. hope coworker gets well soon :( fucking guy extended family vaccinated (unless 12), live Left coast, zero talk covid thanksgiving plan discussion. mean sick, stay home, that’s it?   ask doctor. 

That said, contraindications ITP. Even ITP Support Association encourages vaccination. immunosuppressive drugs may need 3rd dose. lady infuriating. Getting vaccinated personal choice, impact everyone. getting vaccinated showing level selfishness that's pure narcissisms, also showing little cares anyone, even herself. 

It's people like drag society going end us.  going replicate extensive lab work already done? means research? mean needs read FB posts idiots toxic echo chamber? think know means. I'm really interested see happen winter. many people (in first world nations anyway) either vaccinated previously gotten infected, I'm hoping even cold flu season cause big spike hospitalizations/deaths like saw last winter. Hopefully Aug-Sep-Oct wave last big one. -Virtual Thanksgiving Christmas again

lol idea keeps popping Reddit based older research paper seem account fact problem predominantly affects men explain problem almost exclusively second dose.

Maybe men susceptible dose 2? second dose injected improperly? first dose? Both? seems suspect me.  People still listen guy? Lol  Hume's guillotine. Boston much narrow city boundary north east cities. would like New York Manhattan  heres hint rest planet = ""probably not"" thus wheel keeps turning. see here, community transmission gets passed certain threshold, lost Zero COVID game.

Not really. lock weeks try again.

Maybe certain regions would feasible wild nobody even bothered try. seems pretty clear COVID zero great strategy original strain Delta made difficult pursue.  vaccinated pregnant, breastfeeding, baby pretty protected. you’re moving goalposts. 

Please fine day, brother.   Would say age population lack undercounting play much larger role Remember March 2020 said buy masks? remember right, half unvaccinated doctors study indicated planned get vaccinated time. like it, yeah.... 


My family anti vax too. Definitely contemplating lying get booster shot. They're talking bobbing apples kids Halloween.  still large public events not? vaccinated, live life.

Because still people, anti maskers, claim vaccinated.

I want get breakthrough case. people still fucking everything everyone.

I'm hermit either. love art shows, music, eating out, hell even movie theater!

But put hold get check.

If friends/ family house, know vaccinated, I'll hangout. 4-5 us.

But movie theater hundreds people? Anyone could covid idiot get least breakthrough case. worse spread someone unable vaccinated.

You want large events? That's fine. I'm using people like show next year, safe go live life like 2019.  Reminder CDC guidance regularly far risk averse average American. guidance never supposed eat runny eggs, rare beef, oysters.   I’m sorry loss  I'm guessing actually know anyone works hospital truly think that.  live Midwest family lives rural part. None vaccinated. people businesses give shit never have. hospitals city packed damn gills.

I seeing family Thanksgiving Christmas.   ""none us dumb us""  People vaccinated 1 5000 chance getting covid get 5 100000 chance needing go hospital. Overall  0.00001 percent risk dying covid vaccinated means ever come profession cave many, many times likely die car accident covid.
Can honestly tell three years ago would called idiot wanting throw away prime life order lower chances dying disease .00001% chance killing me? vax available anyone wants US almost developed countries going keep life hold order protect want protection. 
I big supporter capitalism, think missing fact goods services still exist economic system. People need work order food eat electricity plumbing people's houses regardless owns means production. recommend give hope global lockdown a) would end covid, covid still exists countries like Australia new Zealand eradicated it, b) extremely miniscule percentage population would support thing. beliefs supported data all, need fix life accept inherent risk comes live comfortable with. Oh, come on. Literally everything feeds ""anti-vax sentiment."" Stop coddling people *choosing* stupid. amount data research sways even little, let's stop pretending decent people ""careful fearful."" Jfc. Since theft VA, criminal face federal charges? Could read article paying access. Tom Brady.  really seems vary person person. aunt got Covid last year, got year killed her. one example, that’s I’ve seen. (Also unvaccinated course was.)   Don’t say that, wife did, whole family ended covid. Luckily nothing bad happened, hindsight could’ve really bad.

Now we’re vaccinated, I’m confident seeing family tho.   question. people ITP (thrombocytopenia) safety take moderna Pfizer vaccine? sister scared cause bleeding platelet count drops. still millions conspiracy idiot fools saying covid harmless flu Im vaccinated, see anybody thats also vaxed, im going around people care less health really gullible believe everything fauci says.

So, never follow advice doctor..?

So cover mouth sneeze?

Wash hands?

I follow advice experts. car problem, ask mechanic. plumber.  ignorant believe whatever suits you. like live real world  I'm fauci like alot people.. living rock? even turned football game last 3 weeks? Lol recall getting rapid heartbeat following second Pfizer shot went away days. think I'm fine? certainly hope so. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Main Character Syndrome Agreed. one goes look Fauci actually said, he's making broad stroke recommendation much country still issues COVID (i.e. South). saying absolutely gather Christmas, early say country, whole, feel safe gathering Christmas. People see messaging figure best families, although already know many families fully vaccinated gather like nothing wrong anyways terrible risk management.     Covid March, got double vaccinated Pfizer July, protected I? Nice  much reaction first two..just injection site soreness. booster (at 8 months) knocked out. massive lethargy two days put weight arm. clear day three. also see single mention at-home rapid tests! think Americans capable knowing use minimize risk gathering (despite FDA EUA)? CDC messaging makes laugh/cry, vaccinated immunologist took COVID precautions seriously throughout. Definitely hanging 70 year old parents holiday season (after get boosters rapid test minimum). completely touch messaging make people turn away, perhaps instead misinformation. Let's quick math see we're at:

330 million people live America.

60%, 198 million vaccinated.

An additional 43.6 million Americans virus already.

330 - 198 - 43.6 = 88.4 million Americans antibodies virus all.


All making huge assumptions:

1) everyone achieved immunity either vaccine natural immunity, wane months.

2) there's overlap people virus who've vaccinated, even though know are. know many.

3) accurate count actual COVID cases.

4) we're still going dealing delta variant, delta plus, strain

But arguments sake, let's pretend really 88.4 million susceptible Americans.

We saw 3 COVID waves 2020: April/May, second July/August third December/January. 

By far, December/January peak worst.

In 2021 we've seen wave April/May, big one July/August/September.

Bottom line: still tens millions Americans immunity pattern keeps repeating, we're massive COVID wave Christmas New Year's.

Fauci want break bad news America penchant shooting messenger. absolutely safe gather Christmas. First says wear mask, switches wear one, tells us stay home get hospitals ready, stay home vaccine, stay home vaccine. joke. Reddit put huge pedistal.  Tell COVID stop violating freedoms, it'll go away promise I'm vaccinated. siblings vaccinated. parents vaccinated.

We're enjoying Christmas. I'm done protecting unvaccinated people would step dead body ""rights."" wiping groceries 

Man, waste was. Virus doesn’t even transmit way. whole station set cleaning sprays paper towels. Every single take container (even little sauces), every box Amazon, every single grocery item thoroughly wiped several months.   think problems equal measure. able fix stupid fast enough, never late better job messaging. vaccinated person whose whole family vaccinated done. business usual me. I'll show card get boosters needed going whatever social activities want. certain point live Covid. That's spirit! get vaccinated can't around vaccinated people?

That reason get vaccinated.  happily interacting vaccinated people, and, I'll even go public places unvaccinated people are. I’m surrounded states well, even haven’t heard (IE, journalists make money writing stories states bad states good). state, peaked 1,269 patients hospitalized Covid December 2020. current hospitalizations 237. vast majority unvaccinated adults. Delta statewide mask mandate. I’d argue social pressure state alter lives beyond getting vaccinated inherently immoral. got in-laws year.

Exactly this. wife home year perfect. Day went Whole Foods bought tasty, organic foods Thanksgiving meal. house quiet. wine, enjoyed cigars deck. Near dusk colder layered up, donned fur coat took little walk around neighborhood. Peaceful, serene late sunset cold air. Came back nice dessert watching movie. perfect thoroughly enjoyable.    Well son's mom demands get Christmas every year. alone anyways, probably working sweet holiday pay instead.   listen Dr. Osterholm’s podcast every week, said lot. don’t know virus surges, it’s likely continue so, regardless do. Basically, virus going virus.

Myself, taken pandemic far seriously anyone personally know, spouse still visited parents last Christmas.

Of course two weeks strict quarantining, driving rather flying, getting negative covid tests prior traveling.

There _safe_ ways it, long 100% faith everyone involved adhere proper protocols. *de facto*, *de jure*. US law allow mandates drugs approved, are, right refuse chucked window. anti-vaxxers forget vaccine mandates approved use law since George Washington mandated Continental soldiers get smallpox vaccine. speak behalf entire nation, one part it.

He asked individual question individual perspective - whether people get together Christmas.  said nothing vaccinations, just, maybe maybe not, ""focus like laser continuing get those- cases down"", sure sounds like he's saying regardless vaccination restricting activities making plans even human contact vaccinated people. take pretty good Christmas last year? previous 100,000 deaths large entirely preventable. know who’s refusing vaccinations...   USA undercounting well. Maybe high percentage, number ‘extra deaths’ compared normal year quite higher number ‘covid attributed deaths’ too. Counts deaths causes death, including COVID-19, presented. deaths due COVID-19 may assigned causes deaths (for example, COVID-19 diagnosed mentioned death certificate), tracking all-cause mortality provide information whether excess number deaths observed, even COVID-19 mortality may *excess deaths* listed due alsheimers hypertension similar probably wouldn’t happened without Covid. un Saudí Arabia, I'm loop Go ahead. one cares.

Sorry hear feeling sick! implying virus spread china months announced, evidenced purchasing PCR testing supplies higher quantity 2019 2018.

it reported major sites today. perfect way put it. I’ll never understand incessant need antagonistic. God forbid someone want protect child deadly pandemic disagree. Disinformation problem, example. 

And viral shedding evidence distinguish shedding live viral particles dead viral particles. According recent research, vaccinated shed dead viral particles.  Ooof sucks mayne. mask six feet option used.  TX. Even liberal Austin, life pretty much back normal except supply shortages.  test couple days travel (probably required airline) days arriving, pretty safe. Especially they've gotten 3 shots Pfizer. got Moderna still need lie. got Pfizer list long absolutely refuse even tell whitest white lies go buy pack cigarettes, take puff one, throw rest away swear never touch smokes again. Congrats. former smoker eligible. read family gatherings still discouraged downright bizarre actually going public.

You read though. read early able give meaningful guidance holiday gatherings situation rapidly change unexpected ways. *J-Just wear mask something, uh-yea take 10 booster shots 17 lockdowns triple mask home yea fine*  can't think single LORT theater country that's putting annual production Christmas Carol year, intent cramming many people possible theater.  

Ugh.  This.

And also exist plenty deleterious long-term outcomes death people—including vaccinated—would well avoid. want get breakthrough case.

Good luck that. Covid endemic. live country 90% vaccination rate everyone 12 breakthrough cases. logic setting never anything ever again.

Live life. long vaccines remain effective moderate severe illness actions won’t change. saying (trying use words) «India uses ivermectin (nothing vaccine» opposed countries, isn’t good argument use ivermectin. Tiny bit arm stiffness around injection site day after. Otherwise tell got it. shot least side effects. variant called MU. seems capability bypass previous infection immunity, vaccine immunity evading, infectious, time deadly keeping week half 2 weeks incubation time. saving grace far appear competing Delta, far infectious spread easily variant date. bad conspiracy. explain places like New Zealand virtually covid cases *or* flu cases year? covid cases outside normal flu season also.

The claim flu still happening tagged covid deaths fantasy, something based facts. still test flu cases (just few). 

The flu covid even share symptoms. Covid distinct. bet 4% valid medical religious excuse, insufferable coworkers, bad teachers, both, replaced someone gives damn. Good riddance! Great news, 100M morons work on. lot people still feel way, idea forgot /s not.

My main real-life COVID stress unvaccinated people, really know any, social tension vaccinated people different risk tolerances.  judging people going movies, restararunats, whatever.

There people never anything again.  I've long stopped sacrificing mental health physical health unvaccinated.  last complication peoples' kids, quite figured balance that.  I'm certainly happy wear mask make whatever accommodations, but, I'm deferring cautious people know's activity level either. everybody vaccinated pandemic would largely US. it’s still BAD.

Is it?  point, I'm opinion mild moderate breakthrough cases pretty common. also suspect mild moderate long haul symptoms also common. Fairly sure them. Nevertheless, vaxed try convince others so. roundabout way, vaxed person, Covid really much different flu (I'm echoing original bullshit pre-vax days here) although contagious. put hospital rare cases kill rarer cases. 

And still, due risks remain, remain cautious. sucks decided go indoor concert tickets for. Lots indoor events going year, wish better understanding fallout that, schools course. know unvaxed severe breakthrough cases. whole risk equation getting pretty complicated us living post-vax pandemic times. easy blame messaging think many cases bigger problem poor science literacy rampant misinformation. 

There's much messaging situation uncertain rapidly changing. realize allowed obese people yet.  fully vaccinated family 100% gathering holidays year.

Even daily new case rate jumps 200/100k vaccinated constituting 50% new infections?

I'm guessing probably not.

That's experts saying early offer guidance point. also making bold, declarative statements dangerous.

Now, likely happen? Absolutely not. could new variant concern—which impeded existing vaccines—emerge then? Absolutely.

You family would better served continuing listen experts rather rigid. much responsibility Trump administration failure reducing death infections covid? like imagination even envision immune system virus even works. never able understand brains see world.

They can't admit fault take responsibility actions. terrorist attacks means blame someone else. told father won’t seeing us he’s vaccinated, even though 🤷‍♀️ print directly CDC. would steal don’t understand electronic records aren’t way verify vaccination. live NYC, NYS excelsior pass wallet app phone, put name, date birth, shot got, app verified vaccinations. use app eat restaurants indoors stuff.

Hes far ""hack"". media politicians trying start War Christmas early year lol. They’re putting words Fauci’s mouth. Saw day member Congress tweeting, “I don’t care Biden Fauci say, stop celebrating Christmas faith!” (I’m paraphrasing histrionic performative bullshit.) It’s culture wars way down. Sorry dad.

I hope taking actions make sure spread legitimate nefariously released disease people, increasing case hospitalization cout, thereby causing people get vaccinated fear.

I also hope considers nefarious actors interested identifying potential troublemakers eliminating compliant, getting vaccinated, he's marking scrutiny action.  problem viewpoint, perfectly reasoned you, pandemic one individual. 

You might fine risking breakthrough case, kids near, service workers still work regardless risk, healthcare workers need see.

Those groups asked take cumulative risk choices everyone come contact with. remember, many/most still infectious breakthrough cases asymptomatic. 

So yes, likely 99.9% fine. say everyone around you? “I’m natural health person, trusted immune system.”

But … why?  

For starters, fallible things human body, immune system definitely one least trustworthy.  Surely everyone knows someone immune system that’s nearly killed (allergy autoimmune disease)?

And don’t go around trusting systems. “Oh, I’d never get type 2 diabetes, trust endocrine system.”

It’s daft phrase.   related? Since need permission? vaccines ever supposed keep hospital, promise preventing infection all. want admit moving goalposts. problems study, agreement studies.  caveat expecting this:

If vaccinated, problem. not, well forget getting together. Thank summary. really discouraging hear. Agreed. wasting much societal political capital bickering mask mandates distancing protocols one follow, pushing truly effective strategies around vaccines vaccine mandates.  Good, mandates work. Lol ok understand definite period time flu vaccine protects people certain number months. seems like I've always heard want super early leaves little exposed tail end flu season. Octoberish good hear may good go soon.  it. apparent gatherings safe least he's touch reality, unlike CDC regarding holidays.    right anti-vax thing. Hesitancy might appropriate. I'll take look links get back. smart scientist are, really, really touch regards society humans actually behave. OK. going set metrics safe live normally again. vaccinated likely die way grandma's car accident covid. Permanent restrictions rules never work. Covid stay. guess want stay house forever that's choice, rest society willing take small level risk order enjoy living life.  Despite downvoted, think you’ve made great point. You’re considerate people that’s huge point many missing. 

Yes sucks see family long. It’s depressing af. Even working healthcare dealing closely. forever, things aren’t comfortable level yet, force it?   saying ""we dont yet"" touch reality? realistic thing could say. know 4 5 people covid 2020 ,then got pfizer vax 2021.  


The first shot acted like 2nd shot others; sick feeling, fever, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Their second shot nothing. Delta evade immune system detection particularly well, unlike variants fizzled out. replicates infects cells much rapidly potentially overwhelms waning immune protection. booster original shot brings antibodies back levels need be. Unfortunately lack empathy endemic pandemic imo. I'm missing Christmas, man. gonna gather outdoors middle winter depressing zoom call two years pandemic wide vaccine availability cases decline. can't believe they'd even try issue guidance early, too.   many UCP travelling taking advantage Responsibility Exemption Program. I’m tired homeless begging every intersection town many jobs available there. lot resources state get people street. need try access benefits. anyone could help advice mom? wants get fully vaxxed, got first Pfizer shot February, day facial numbness, tingling/burning sensations fingers hands, legs, toes...she never complete arm, leg, facial numbness, scattered throughout. 

Her doctor pharmacist said think get another mRNA vaccine, hoping Johnson Johnson would work, family doctor told he's familiar research mixing vaccines. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this, know anyone able get fully vaxxed side effects like this? mom 65 really wants get fully vaxxed keep safe, still living locked life, frustrated doctor pharmacist might want wait anti-virals hit market.

Despite seriousness, geeking whole situation.  ""tHe LiBeRaLs AtTaCkiNG ChRiStMaS!"" K? Literally one banning anything. Go cry recommendations Facebook. Hmm interesting. I’ve listening interviews really could either. perspective is, I’m vaccinated delta likely get COVID anyway. it’ll also likely similar illnesses gotten big deal. gotta bit careful around vulnerable numbers go down. youre acting like theres ton people refusing take vaccine. ""Sometimes people seatbelts airbags still die crashes, therefore really no-one driving."" 


You folks still yelling void ""breakthrough"" cases 2026. Get shot wear mask move on, people.  Go watch clip. There’s fishing. timey-whimey, wibbly-wobbly anyhow. :) oh FFS. dining drinking strangers across country Dr Fauci still sure family gather around fireplace Christmas.

These fuckers needs fix messaging. people didn’t even avoid family last year. coworkers pretty much one didn’t travel see extended family holiday last year. yes one coworkers got covid gathering family Def white one

Edit: dunno brand, recommendation? fail understand relatively rich country like US high death count, whereas countries like India entire continent Africa, much lower death counts (yes, even accounting government undercounting India factor 10).  someone help understand this?

&amp;#x200B;

There dozens factors lead US larger official counts nation India, entire continent Africa, few:

1. US likely records keeps track data throughout territory far better health systems institutions India hard time getting detailed information remote poorer regions nation. helps contribute India's under-reporting issues. 
2. go India's numbers 450,000 deaths. undercounting factor 10, total death count 4.5 million, six times many US
3. Africa entire continent composed dozens nations, different amounts resources could used respond keep track pandemic. Many nations highly impoverished suffer internal well external conflicts compounds difficulty responding pandemic keeping good records impact especially remote unstable territories. Many parts African continent also contend pandemic, large variety infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Dengue, periodic outbreaks Ebola Marburg, Polio still, hundreds pathogenic diseases mention societal factors like malnutrition, extreme poverty, densely populated urban centers lack access hygienic water supplies.
4. Culture US. pandemic, uncommon all- fact, norm- workers go work sick long could get bed house. Many people afford take sick days, many workers feared losing future hours used sick day. lot workers worked professions conducive spreading infectious diseases like point-of-sale jobs like servers, back-of-house jobs like cooks, everything retail.
5. first major outbreaks Covid US like NYC metro area spring 2020 hit hard fast time CDC confirmed community transmission occurring, thousands people already infected incubating virus. That's took little week half one man Westchester first suspected confirmed case community transmission, hospitals NYC surrounding metro areas overwhelmed critical cases streaming ICU ER's.
6. administration first sustained waves infections hit spring 2020 probably worst suited administration deal crisis since Nero ruled Rome 68AD.
7. Denialism ran rampant many communities US leading many people ignoring public health information distrusting institutions providing information, helped virus continue spread people refused wear masks practice social distancing early days Pandemic. problem persists day anti-vaxxers anti-maskers continuing spread toxic vitriol.
8. population US, especially hardest hit demographics, highest incident rates comorbidities lead severe Covid infections, Diabetes, heart disease, chronic pulmonary issues world.

That's things could think top head. Hmm interesting. heard immunity infection crap shoot-some get lot, get little. 

But neither virologist immunologist 🤷🏻‍♀️ Vaccine mandates schools, employers, arenas venues, fly. Covid treatment costs unvaccinated people covered insurance. pushed. Anything else wasting time. nobody's gonna skip 2nd xmas row, unless wanted anyway need excuse. kid **not** die way. harmful cohesive society ignorance imho, often go hand hand always Facebook used destabilize world. exactly got skepticism from. Masks still important public places pretty abysmal vaccination rates. Compare Ontario (which still mask mandates public places) BC Alberta (which got rid back July). Ontario weathering 4th wave pretty well. Alberta calling military. 

That said very, little risk attending private gatherings fully vaccinated people, indoors without masks. Lol. Butter certain milk products taste like latex since spring 2020. manage.  Yeah, virtual school last year kids, wanted sign year, back beginning spring. right vaccines approved husband (foolishly) thought plenty time, start school year people get vaccinated things would way less severe returning normal. Boy wrong. feel dumb didn’t even occur half freaking population would flat refuse it. 

Our kids started school wearing masks, despite district mask mandate thousands quarantined 300% positive cases neighboring district mask mandate, finally started called “mask mandate”, gave parents ability “opt out”. reported 25% opt rate 150% cases neighboring district. dumb. problem everyone vaccinated ?? în human nature gather vaccinated sick covid loss smell. lasted 3 days I'm already getting back slowly. absolute nonsense. COVID March 2020 honestly say far worse flu still lingering issue. complete total misinformation downplaying disease kills almost 1 50 people. father bought conspiracy entirely legitimate disease released insidiously force people get vaccinated will. think would get vaccinated even got sick either. drugs cut risk dying cancer, doesn’t mean I’m going knowingly things cause cancer. People play fast loose disease blow mind. don’t even want cold. dying standard. don’t want feel miserable days end schedule recreation disrupted. And, I’m fortunate enough paid sick days excellent health insurance, doesn’t mean want use them. would want that? get shots. No, fear justified.

It's really big deal, feel exactly way shot before. shot.

It's important get it, *doesn't change you*. participating uncontrolled crowd-sourced trial horse dewormer count ""doing research""? Maybe try instead clogging hospital beds... new daily cases daily deaths back reasonable level, like June, would make sense losses restrictions. that’s we’re at. everyone vaccinated gathering fine, arent vaccinated avoid gathering. problem people gathered last year ones unvaccinated going gather regardless Another flaw mandate described New York, need 1st shot. 1st shot far less effective 2 shots. fact, CDC doesn’t even consider “vaccinated” protection poor. actuality, it’s known commonly, CDC certainly knows it, first days 1st shot you’re actually infectious! 

 point fact, New York mandated 1 shot, knew many people would kicked jobs restaurants, etc. mandated 2 shots. point fact, ~60% New Yorkers fully vaxxed. New York knew couldn’t get away forcing ~40% people needing fired weren’t fully vaxxed. required 1 shot even though that’s pretty worthless reducing transmission.

 mean mandates following up-to-date science. okay scared, I'm pretty sure us always scared getting shot. fine, almost 6.4 billion shots given worldwide! time year (happens pretty continuously, goes overdrive around holidays) people claim they're victim get vaccinated despite fact always going whatever wanted anyway. think people suffer health anxiety/mental health. It’s like trying argue someone phobia afraid fear target. Unfortunately, social media enables type thinking, fewer regular people feel way, real life increasingly frustrating made pretty specific statement. whataboutism unnecessary uncalled for.  think risk high vaccinated family ending ICU celebrating holiday, yes.  everyone physically capable getting vaccine actually got vaccinated, maybe things said. mean, Fauci's job make sure nice Christmas, keep people safe face public health crises, we're still facing. surprising really would leaning towards guidance. Whether agree (I'm vaccinated plan taking advice. gathering vaccinated family friends), think fair throw Fauci's advice away entirely he's erring side caution. also never really lived pandemic before. going flu pandemic, quite possible prove flu shot. Circumstances change, telling 6 months looks like, let alone years. rather possible outcome indeed last serious wave, prevalence drops point becomes seasonal inconvenience, mandates. think go smoothly you! OK tell staff vaccination site little nervous. help feel ease 👍  would need go testing , even variation OG version? can't piggyback original approval since itd largely same? maximally utilitarian, would skip boosters instead ship vaccines parts world lower vaccination rates higher population density. see short/medium-term deaths developed nations, also reduced overall transmission globally. selfless perspective means fewer overall deaths. selfish perspective means fewer mutations virus would ultimately benefit us long run.

The reason looks like one charge knows plan right there's debate going scientists politicians, they're two sides. Shipping vaccines away telling people wait almost fully vulnerable get booster probably prudent politically impossible.

Eg. Me: got first mRNA shot March, getting fourth Wednesday. Data analysis hard   Fauci - sorry wasn’t clear. Edited comment number shrinking. can’t fix stupid. people far gone… true. still damn effective. Like odds anything bad low it. like people forgetting getting sick normal thing 2 years ago again, making claims risks kids 12 without data misleading. Hey there!

They sure making hard agree them.  It’s fine vaccinated. I’ve heard interview various doctors infected getting vaccinated offers best protection. 

Obviously that’s assuming make first infection, get vaccinated would well protected real, many people think vaccines worthless now? drives nuts  swear every time people get TV shoot foot misguided messaging.

This pandemic revealed serious need high-level science *communicators* FDA, CDC, elsewhere. scientists, necessarily, Bill Nye types fun, memorable demo - [a flamethrower face mask, - answer questions lay person's level.

Scientists learn careful wording ""technically correct"" style answers simply need press conference aimed public. 2022 normal holiday season

When got 2,000 Americans dying covid every day, 1/4 country emergency rooms overfull hard-ration medical care, yes - normal. Even pretend is. 

 think we'll October 2022 ... yeah. completely drop ball another year... knows. end friends? vaccinated good health, I’m guessing fine? 

Sounds like understand risks. Getting covid young vaccinated person isn’t risky. what's wrong that? divisive policy gets people sides passionate sometimes violent. policy potentially cause lawsuits. subject unwanted attention. lose/unmotivate staff. Plus, whole bunch repercussions listed. least government steps in, offset blame upset stakeholders much. 

Besides, governments responsibility make call set requirement. business responsible setting vaccine policy subject drastic legal implications. ""effectively zero"" != ""zero""

It's statistics. also ""effectively zero"" chances winning lottery someone's eventually gonna win it.

People go around claiming nonsense ""doesn't seem explosion cases anymore"" we're still 100K new cases every day (with 2000 deaths per day) hospital systems bulging seams occupants unvaccinated types.

We also know people get infected increases chances mutation that's serious. Thankfully deadly strains contagious Delta (and Delta deadly original strain) can't compete Delta. Hopefully see strain that's contagious deadly Delta. Deaths children infected COVID-19 also rare, confirming findings even encouraging conclusions, Kakkar said parents take study sense false security would discourage vaccinating children, given study showed kids good health also ended ""A child intubated intensive care needs months rehabilitation, unfortunately cannot predict child fall category."" comment someone currently working ICU.
Do think know better do?  Hum! imagine that, will: humanity disregards science slowly fry sun turns us. living I'd already chosen suspended animation trip planet moon far, far away. (Sorry...mixed tenses. much Dr. Who, expect.)   mean, makes sense grandma exposed folks. might carry covid back her. family aml already, probably making much difference get together holidays.   That’s Reddit best   fence? disgusting human being

 call ""dumb"" vaccinating. hospitalized twice almost died .........and still fence covid vaccinations?  that's longer stupidity, that's terminal selfishness.......she must think one needing ICU bed.  


If gets covid tell go elsewhere. Oh ya they'll cross state move making 7.25 hour. They'll use thejr savings totally able accumilate making poverty wages.  Hopefully weeks away 🤞🤞🤞  many fucking people confuse cold flu.

Could've left ""I can't think"" mind. :-) little arm pain. folks know day rest fine that. Also live New England different experience. towns area mask requirements. I’d say 98% people see still wear masks. work requires masks. wife’s work requires masks testing every time go in. I’m entirely avoiding gatherings cannot say back normal means. can't believe insurance companies Actuaries vocal this. comes money employers pay portion employees health insurance. goes --and rightly so, COVID expensive treat ICU-- employers either pass costs onto employees mandate vaccinations prevent rise.  I’m sure you’re getting downvoted. think point valid. Comparing regulated public events intimate gatherings varying restrictions like comparing apples &amp; oranges. Showing vaccine cards &amp; masks vs gatherings possibly unvaxxed people hugging, kissing, breathing other’s air ⬆️ people said polio vaccine came 😂😂😂  Fauci even suggest possibility people spend second year away families inviting backlash. talking mitigating risks encouraging family members get vaccinated. current vaccines work perfectly fine Delta. Somehow got lost. slight decline efficacy mild illness enough justify another vaccine. Yeah right - covid death compensation logic western countries human life worth approx $0. right saying NZ's hospital infrastructure - specifically area ICU ITU provision - par? Or, put another way, best placed handle above-average volumes patients? remember reading recent RSV explosion ICU/ITU capabilities - or, lack thereof - shown insufficient terms quantity quality meet demand.

I freely admit may well off-base one... living, needed minimum four months recovered Covid infection eligible get Covid vaccine. say previous Covid infection offers better immunity Covid vaccination. Anyway, you’re correct; there’s hurry her.  CDC recommendations:

-Virtual Thanksgiving Christmas again

-Drop food gifts safe distance

-Drive around wave neighbors 

-Put fan window (if you’ve Chicago Thanksgiving Christmas know funny is…)

-Gather outside distance 

This messaging ridiculous. It’s like don’t vaccine. don’t even know Onion could make up. can’t think vaccinated people unless small children health issues severely immunocompromised.  parents - ""oh fine, flu. Still getting shot"".....  fucking insane people see getting shot mask mandates bit tied   Yep, agree this. taken virus seriously beginning. Socially distanced hard last year, wore masks, wearing masks I'm crowded/indoor public spaces, got vaccinated soon could, etc... feel comfortable gathering vaccinated family friends - masks unless someone present requests it.

We're NE well masking time interact anyone, also young kids cannot get vaccinated yet. know us vaccinated state ~70% vaccinated much better, still taking risks. guess we're gunning 100% without covid achievement. thinking first started haha. ""Uh, highly developed country seems isolated rest world control flow people really bad? New Zealand."" even trying figure pull got really strict, seemed odds low I'd able get even company hired sponsored work visa. could say work remote control. way thinking stupid. Get vaccinated dont see family. quite simple.  family unvaccinated, think may spend holidays myself. idiots listening, still gonna listening. know is, personally, probably family Thanksgiving Christmas first time years. can't look civil people care damage do. really change heart. ""Just thing made go hmmm."" IMO. still research decides going get said still considering wants vaccinated. ""I need research figure looks like."" need therapy. need slang game; TIL bennies refer benefits 100 dollar bills. Added edit comment. comment suddenly makes lot sense. guess surprised. still thinking getting vaccinated? moron!  Data age 18+. one 18 included.

Acute Myocarditis incidence 5.8 cases per 1,000,000. Insanely low also non-life threatening.  mean tell year encouraging mask use protocols limit spread infectious flu-like disease, far fewer cases flu?! almost like pandemic protocols we've used designed response deadly flu pandemic something!

It amazing, it?

I know going continue wearing masks public long acceptable so, hope (although know going happen) America adopts wearing masks public general courtesy

I got cold ***2 fucking years***, largely masks social distancing. Short answer, probably. True answer, people people Like saying armed robbery discussing global terrorism. 

It's odd false equivalence demonstrates people's overall ignorance public health.  Same. think lot factors play besides nailing interview not. know, graduated, worked previously, position applied experience it, whether currently employed position not. People ""network,"" went well known schools, worked well known companies, currently employed already almost walk job, even half-ass interview. Many companies brush bad day maybe confident abilities, need try hard. look face says cares fool thinks?! allowed go back normal whenever want. Texas Florida back normal long long time. No. would almost make sense. First, flyover states back then. Madisonians exists concerned non slaveholding states. 

Our upper chamber largely exists Great Britain's parliament on. want know why, explore medieval history. really based demos theory. said vaccinated people can, christmas family (because vaxed) Religious exemptions valid, especially pandemic like this. can't imagine religion would actually advocate putting people around unsafe situation. additional avenue anti-vaxxers exploit.   colleges mandated vaccination testing bunch vaccinated college fans attending football game isn’t big risk seems. divide real. I’d never keep someone away based decision. That’s childish mean. compare community rate? Usually track   Y'all need excuse? say ""no thanks"" get it.

Nobody entitled time. get tired seeing empathy sort miracle cure worlds ills. isn't. Empathy projection person emotions attempt feel people feeling, going make understand anything situation people in. Getting hospitalized covid will. like asking guy empathize pushing baby out. thing magically understood. respectful sympathy, understand empathy guess work. also goes way.

Good luck body, choice right? anti-vax chuckleheads screaming week? wheezing guess, depending whether they've caught delta yet. They're still allowing cruise ships Alaska. Yet basically Alaska hospitals crisis standards care, urban rural. urban ICUs full close full. That's hundreds thousands people per day per ship moving port port port. money.

Yet I'm suppose gather handful people wearing mask?   think wrong that.

NBA even longer bubble w/ strain even contagious wuhan strain time(delta dominant one now). fact Tokyo olympics still happened state emergency already proved gonna shitshow much japan still access vaccines.

What take referring to? even read article? Problem don’t usually make money kind   Good hear cases declining. 

Seems Boston Chicago similar/better case rates.
 Mine felt funny every since booster symptoms faded 3 days (most I've felt symptoms 3 shots). Hopefully one goes away soon too. think Canada done lot right get us point. amazing vaccination rate, people mostly compliant masks everywhere, limiting store occupancy still cool. low, steady infection rate low hospitalizations vaccinated. 

I think afford little less cautious now.

I see American friends getting live life feel like still back April 2020 (with exceptions course, everybody this).   pretty sad see state board. this. We're seeing data re-infection rising. still tons states greater 1 infection rate. still know much vaccine immunity wear many actually get boosted. thing may well drag another year two.

No. doctors said safe fly. Because, year, vaccine readily available. No, point they're making double vaxxed family's together Christmas... cancel everything others unvaxxed. That's test sufficiently US. can't release have. couple months ago, US policy test mild moderate cases. definition, breakthroughs serious.

Fortunately, countries fastidious. track mild moderate breakthrough cases. Here's study grading severity breakthrough Please read article clarify something me? parents brother (all fully vaccinated Pfizer) want come visit (in Canada) live abroad. take 2 airplanes (5 hours &amp; 4 hours). terrified contracting COVID since one 3 little ones immunocompromised (and complete lockdown year accordingly). Originally going send hotel 14 days decided maybe sending hotel 3-4 days get tested come here. article says “someone has, suspected having, COVID-19 get tested three five days exposure”. mean parents/brother get tested 3 days trip show negative safely bring home us? Thank much insight. much information sadly keep finding conflicting statements. HPV shots spaced long increments time still prescribribed 3-dose regimen, 1 shot 2 boosters, though time great. That's like *being* research. that. That’s fair comparison since people wouldn’t know technically counts “the city” limited typical areas. (They didn’t annex bunch former suburbs like northeast cities guess)  best way avoid AIDS sexually transmitted diseases life-long total abstinence, that’s hard people, public health officials tend focus condoms regular testing. 10 years huge amount either. ive got 2 cousins teaching experience, 30s Covid-19 say: also birthday babies. couple million billion per human. Christmas birthdays, one. live country, mainly due that.

My mom also compromised immune system. also potential risk factor.

But us vaxxed, everything social distancing, seeing local friends, part hunkering down, I'm ready see family.

It's ""a risk"", least done without permanently living apartment never leaving  people NEED suffer face overwhelming evidence? Seems like mental defect. fucking matter. None matters. reluctantly went friend concert first time years last week, packed full thousands people, elbow elbow, *maybe* ~10% wearing masks properly. despite venue advertising mask rules would enforced would option social distancing (hint: wasn't). assholes perpetuating stupid pandemic reckless irresponsibility going keep nonsense they've none ever going end. listen even vaccine, refused wear masks, refuse social distance, traveled despite told travel last year - fuck would change now? give shit anyone else means even slightest inconvenience them, result us tried responsible get suffer right along them. Ugh.  absolutely touch. entire family vaccinated I’m going see Christmas. It’s ridiculous jackass say think otherwise. It’s wonder faith public institutions low. caught Covid July last year jumped vaccine last December soon saw giving out. expensive unreasonable woman people like reason wife works negative income. wife pays healthcare premiums gets take home pay.  Thanks much! encouraging :) little column A, little column B.    So, clarify, cool Met gala, Emmys, Obama could birthday, supposed visit Christmas. 

It's big club, folks, ain't it... benefits. that's offending you, best therapy twice weekly Stay safe! gotta put family people's feelings.  Well problem unvaccinated kids.  delta worse also. live one irresponsible stats seeing 50% stores. worried vaccinated people hospital. going listen fauci

The amount vaccinated persons hospital outshined vaccinated.

But, similar masks: us masked, safe. us vaccinated, safe. chart somewhere different vaccines breakthrough cases? 
and hospitalized etc. entire family vaccinated, there's reason us gather. reasonable person hesitant assuming conditions. careful telling truth around parts hombre, already getting downvoted. like.. magical pill shot something people could get would allow less resume normal life. Delta (the vaccine doesn’t protect well it) unvaccinated young children. last year? Same. made 9 days. three kids masked, masks aren’t mandatory school. 5 us had/have it. Husband vaccinated. Oldest 11.5. Waiting hoping vaccine approval soon. It’s definitely both. Selfish take resources dumb subject needless risks already getting burned. mean...its mostly Colorado's water. mean I’ve taken pandemic super seriously entire time, point going see fully vaccinated friends family without restrictions. aren’t throwing huge ragers anything, telling people might able see families Christmas allowing huge crowds sporting events, etc., seems pretty tone deaf. far know, they’re still trials phase. Last update saw expecting EUA request end year. wealthy least half century enough old people get high death count. fucking idiot. Still needs ""do research deciding whether vaccinate"". even mean, people honestly think ""their research"" better clinical trials performed scientists? I'm done caring. waste hospital resources. trust professionals/medical science go hospital dying covid. Plain Logic go way supreme court, people still won’t understand it. wonder many don’t believe science logical/critical thinking. All. None  closed vaxxed?  Thank family fully vaccinated.

Isn’t vaccination passport required attend games EPL? club-by-club? Seems extending requirement players would straightforward…no passport, play, pay… Mandates work. kids 12 can't get vaxxed yet.   said effectively zero risk children 12. also admitted evidence true. make sense. saying wary approved children claim safe young children based anything except assumption. deemed safe young children, would already approved them.  called selfish would isolate vaxxed?  Covid restrictions short term decreased number flu deaths, idea expect going next flu season, enough data prepare flu vaccine way usually do. Double-vaxxed underlying health conditions. remember correctly, actually vaccine breakthrough infection. didn’t find huge benefit opposite. 

There discussion r/COVID19 best covid subreddit IMO It’s shorter you’re stupid public health. variants evade existing vaccines.

Nogunna happen. Really unlikely, possible, unlikely. U.S. 44% yet fully vaccinated. leaves plenty virus food lying around.

And tons people immunity previous infection. fully vaccinated Americans got Pfizer shots schedule Israel used, studies showed potency fades starting around 4 months. Without boosting good number vaccinated people become virus food too.

No, just, no. - vaccinations infections we’re far less vulnerable before.

Yes. speaking somebody fully vaxxed board epidemiologists’ recommendations day one: sure I’m prepared give Christmas. think I’ll strictly self-isolate two weeks before, must.

Just saying, another isolated holiday season probably asking much people. everybody vaccinated pandemic would largely US. it’s still BAD.

And Delta variant happened COVID prominent able mutate. That’s going keep happening. many people COVID, still tons left chew through.  lost grandpa last week, seen since Covid began.

I going family gathering Christmas. Masked vaxxed. isn’t lot evidence getting vaccinated immediately symptomatic infection useful. already circulating antibodies point That’s matter opinion, could say 0.1% highly effective. that’s precisely hate adjectives used instead numbers. Another poster said 60-90% definition haven’t seen standardized. that’s case it’s better exact number still ideal. weird meme contrarians spread. Frankly, kind creepy 


35,000,000 Americans take statins. screening intervention, making big changes heart disease outcomes.


The death rate heart disease 40% lower 20 years ago. That's I'm Raleigh mask mandate coming back like right moved seems like Wake County relatively well.   100%. No. I’m done. missed last Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas could grandpa died cancer. haven’t family gathering 18 months. 

I’m vaccinated, family. I’m missing gatherings. going go forever refuse isolate loved ones anymore. said *can* skip trials updated version mRNA vaccines. However, Moderna tested update Beta booster, better enough original justify using new version. 40%

It’s definitely higher. Hi, need advice regarding wife.

She received J&amp;J vaccine back 03/19. also frontline worker (pharmacy cashier) neighborhood low vaccine rates among customers. Half coworkers vaccinated either share break room bathroom course.

I healthcare got 3rd Pfizer dose 2 weeks ago. Back March, chance get Pfizer Moderna. went J&amp;J convenience. 

Now silence J&amp;J authorities (not mention pause), anxious catching delta immunity fight it. mention enormous guilt have. parents brother got booster doses week. mention, countless people able get vaccinated early days Pfizer getting booster now. 

Please advise getting two dose Pfizer Moderna her. wait see health officials say. 

P.S. super relevant wife also skin condition gives rashes wearing face mask long hours job. champion is, powers periodically removing mask seconds let skin breathe. worrying given line work.

TLDR: J&amp;J vaccinated risk frontline worker get two dose mRNA vaccine 6 months. NBC loose word ""star"" What’s favorite brand fedora anyone heard anything flu lately? going get shot, website (CDC?) said best get two weeks flu circulating community. [The look like circulation low. 

But wonder people actually tested flu, it’s going around numbers don’t show it? (I know can’t necessarily “time” best moment get flu shot, flu really isn’t circulating anywhere US moment, seems like person who’s low risk serious adverse outcomes might foolish wait?)

Anecdotal evidence someone know locally vaccinated got sick tested negative COVID. attributed illness flu, said going around, doubt actually tested it. (I would GUESS COVID negative accurate also caught COVID vaccines available.) interesting witness number people would describe ""strong, free people"" require authority defy. like rebellious teenagers pretending adults.

If can't make correct decisions abstract need perceived authority rebel against, free thinker petulant child. I'm one sowing FUD here.

Do reasons dispute science effectiveness risks associated currently authorized approved vaccines covid? 

If not, making broad declaration wary suitably authorized dosage underwent proper trials 12 crowd happens? NZ finally prove, once-and-for-all, extended lockdowns pointless situations counter-productive given impacts aspects life? seem forgotten - perhaps properly articulated - lockdowns ""flatten curve"" prevent people dying, but, instead, means spread *inevitable* deaths overwhelm hospital capacity. 

Early pandemic, much-maligned Boris Johnson told UK's population that, ""*people die time*"". Western politician 2021 blunt honesty extremely surprising but, looking back, can't help think level bluntness required. Rather softly-softly advice nudging, perhaps governments, chief scientists, senior doctors, etc. far pointed communications general public. little brutal honesty - perhaps lot - would gone long way.  article: ""Collins wants one else experience unimaginable. ""Social distance, wear mask, whatever takes avoid this,"" said.""

hmm...if something else could do...  quick Google check tells officially India alone Oct 2nd 448,997 deaths. seem saying undercounting factor 10. mean death count 10 times higher? mean 4 million (4,489,970) deaths India alone. Math definitely strong suit may talking population percentages deaths. 

But answer question, rich money necessarily mean person well developed critical thinking skills. People tend feel need belong groups, whether political group family group. Believing group told straying outside group precious people. Whether politics religion ""We family always believed"" common phenomenon worldwide. 

Being fairly wealthy country nothing poor choices people make. would think wealthy country equals better education equals better educated population unfortunately family religious groups trump good education. matter US money buy vaccinations world citizens decide want them. like old saying ""you lead horse water can't make drink"". high death count mainly due people chose take vaccination getting sick. understand bizarre must look outside country surplus safe vaccinations percentage population refused take them. unfortunately world, US wealthy country population citizens refusing vaccinate. basically Israeli data cdc study Kentucky showed, infection plus vaccine best. Israeli data also supported idea infection conferred greater immunity vaccine (although obviously vaccine far preferable way get immunity). It’s really not. Thankfully husband position one us could stay home kids worked. fortunate shouldn’t complain, it’s hard almost 2 years everyone. know job hunting modern era goes! I'm year 2 :) hate much.  Within US, possibly, majority world still unvaccinated (~46% world pop currently vaccinated per ) large parts world ravaged it, providing lots incubating hosts, especially lower income countries (~2.3% vaccination rate according source). That's better headlines x% people infected today vaccinated.


Messaging Gov Media really screw start pandemic. people, incidentally, absolutely want hear much science changed past ~5 months: cloth mask slightly better wearing nothing all, ""6ft distance"" thing pretty well completely meaningless face aerosolized virus

This what's bizarre me. People pick chose things decide pay attention to, never updated beliefs information changed past year. antivaxxers/antimaskers, expect anything from, people wearing masks got vaccinated still wearing cloth masks acting like standing dot floor checkout line anything me. I’d take excuse see family. Fauci advises it? Sorry, fam, I’m staying away science.  Exactly. Fauci speak behalf entire nation, one part it. yes things might fine state high vaccination rates, much fine states. 

Since beginning pandemic seen every month passing practically feels like year. happening June could different July. It’s smarter say wait see speak idiots falsely quote later on.

What difficult job man has. Vaccinated not, people really can’t see past themselves.   Yeah say I'm trying downplay thousands people died months here. 

Just vast majority us lasting memory covid sitting home bored complaining able get haircut. People Australia etc sheltered probably pictured us living traumatic hellscape people dropping like flies Well ""why"" quite simple. obvious data. Efficacy infection drops significantly antibody levels wane. also translates transmission. already knew that. really wanted say ""You care efficacy infection anymore, X, Y, Z"". get vaccinated tomorrow I’m scared. fear justified? :-( even one child dying enough shut schools national level, frankly    Yes please sad also slightly glad anti-vaxxers outside U.S. means monopoly idiots - lion's share them.  sounds amazing. hope great reunion!   easily search typed things google. fact seems large portion people lazy disheartening. Simply searching ""covid antibody lifetime,"" find lot links.

Bottom line, ask this: people advised get booster shot mere eight months, AKA LITTLE HALF YEAR, second shot? vaccinated fine vaccines showen, keep people dying hospital. u vaccinated chosen thier fate.  could literally make one MS Paint print kinkos wanted dick. could get free vaccine.   Also “ studies put mRNA vaccine efficacy severe illness Delta variant 64 per cent 88 per cent range” Saw interview Fox teacher proclaiming 10 years experience replaceable sub children suffer.   
   
Pretty sure luddite army anti-vaxxers causing shit linger point requiring vax talking zero side effects young kids - know that. That's approved yet. Plus risk calculus changes since low risk developing serious disease  obviously depends context - exactly released actual numbers instead using adjectives open misinterpretation. really important read, failure fix public health messaging continues slow way pandemic, see improving. CDCs mask guidelines still read like March 2020, hygiene theatre still far common improvements ventilation indoor air filtration (they barely get passing mention health authorities) currently booster messaging mess people qualify even realize it. kind like speed limit, people going ignore advice guidance, least sets baseline far outside guidance people want go.  lot people vaccinated, ones hold large gatherings tend people

I going speculate holds large vs. small gatherings, personally know. messaging intended unvaccinated people, explicitly stated so. think reasonable state ""status"" things, speak. words current ""threat level"" is, break vaccination status. tell vaccinated people gather Christmas going third year pandemic unreasonable. could another three years, way telling. Risk assessments personal. might choose whatever takes decade avoid contracting virus. Others might feel already place ready live (soon be) endemic state.  whoa whoa, follow science, convenient. Unvaccinated people making wait, regardless vaccinated

I spend person time people know. People trust.

If know you, trust said vaccine.

But person walking store, adamant mask ""have antibodies"", fucking chance. Dude I'm done you. vehemently disagree take. good day.

It isn’t even Halloween yet, ffs. focus first? seems fair, yeah? DR. FAUCI: that's one thing want make sure viewers realize we've done well sense getting 55% population fully vaccinated 64% least one dose. we've got keep pushing vaccination MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. said, ""Don't let guard down."" two new studies show COVID's gotten better transmitting aerosols, air. mean? We're going cold weather. We're going holidays. people need start looking around saying risky gather family members unvaccinated DR. FAUCI: Well, MARGARET, believe way CDC recommended situation dynamic virus community, there's clearly lot spread, even vaccinated indoor setting, congregate setting, makes sense wear mask avoid high risk situations. look ventilation indoor places. know clearly spread aerosol, something spread aerosol, absolutely want ventilation, reason outdoors always much safer indoors. indoors, ventilation going key. that's reason really paying attention MARGARET BRENNAN: gather Christmas, soon DR. FAUCI: know, MARGARET, soon tell. We've got concentrating continuing get numbers try jump ahead weeks months say we're going particular time.

Because everything 0 ""**highly** effective"".. duh? Look college football game weekend tell people gather family holidays. shit makes sense. Inconceivable!  got Moderna booster J&amp;J vaccine. San Francisco already letting folks it. trip upcoming wanted extra booster. day sick-ish (similar getting J&amp;J intense) perfectly fine next day. Hoping it’s effective seems like might bewildered people ITT fully vaccinated *still* seen families. Honestly gone insane this. worse that. least get small child something exchange treats. Many states offered payed rewards exchange vaccination still get everyone. brains somehow less developed. Would people seriously skip second holiday season? Trying figure end game here. deaths due heart disease year, almost nothing stop it.

I'm confused. referring weight control American diet? 

I think *tons* things go around us - seniors getting diagnosed going life-saving medications, stent use, new pacemakers, advances imaging --- portable AEDs (defibrillators), list goes on. think advances we've made since 1977 (when father died ""massive myocardial infarction"") floored. 

Just experience advancements taking place cardiac medicine mean they're happening. 

Irrr...so tell. mean? Yeah I’d like see source too. There’s also difference breakthrough cases coming disease. Here's one found:  guy sounds like uncle whose read many WhatsApp chains ""I think need research"". 

FFS almost died! want know? told 3 months know Thanksgiving, three us likely fully vaccinated Christmas (#3 9 yo) two willing visit family Christmas go own, cannot take shit. 

I got first jab 3 days eligible second schedule. 

If spreads unvaccinated die, well, gotten vaccinated. sympathy gone. patience gone. gone. husband's entire family almost completely vaccinated, took precautions last year all. big family gatherings since beginning summer wedding actually attending going pretty big month. Even grandmother got breakthrough case. attend gatherings, unfortunately including wedding. Well driving crazy, so…   Tell never ""the real flu"" without saying so.

So many fucking people confuse cold flu.

The ""real flu"" ***kicks ass***. caught influenza back high school, young literally best shape life (ran track field, three seasons 4 years.)

Influenza knocked school week. joke recover from. Sounds like decision already made.

""But, but, I'm fully vaccinated"". saying, problem mother self isolating till next spring like flu, Covid cases likely go every winter autumn Restaurant dining rooms closed. Businesses receiving loans. monthly stimulus checks. pills supposed hit pharmacies? 

Seems like ounce prevention worth pound treatment. Yeah fair.  Exactly this... Covid Influenza distinct viruses two entirely different families viruses, whats tests distinct exclusive well...

While might get false positive antibody test are/were infected another human coronavirus (4 species human coronaviruses account ~20% common colds), get false positive are/were infected influenza virus vice versa. Narrator- “they won’t” Prosecute asshole!  Christmas, Chinese new year! Hopefully people use reason go vaccination centre end day get unused dose. That's pretty much got mine. looked up, Florida 28 ICU beds per 100k people operate 95% capacity.

We 4.8 per 100k nationwide  That’s like scene horror movie.   Oh man 10000000%. lack cheap, reliable rapid tests may biggest failure pandemic. Michael Mina beating drum Twitter 18 months.   Yeah, drop lot happening, could actually go really bad. People understand statistics all. Especially comes multiplicative effects dire consequences. Also think huge number people fail realize what's happening particular circumstances. problem numbers vary greatly age. Every single case study male, even though study half females. alone doubles effective rate males. Moreover, age 33. 

A rate 5.3 per million definitely rare, even still 10 per million (for males only) is, start look rate specifically males certain ages, rate goes up. Even it’s still rare, may order magnitude likely number suggests, worth looking for. seem way luck keeping numbers low australia. benefit measurable, tremendous: bit less 2-fold improvement neutralization [Moderna's Beta/multivalent vaccination versus Beta, may lack data Delta. 2-fold improvement quite substantial though - current 20-25% [monthly antibody would amount several extra months protection level.

But cost almost nothing benefit definitely good bit nothing.  guess difficulty getting approval across multiple countries holding mRNA manufacturers back, point there's going pretty fast cascade switching multivalent vaccine. Know what? mean studies done babies born mothers vaccines pregnancy. babies shown antibodies. Breastfeeding isn’t protective, gives baby some. known? It’s entire justification many vaccines given pregnancy  American living Canada (who gone back US three times last 6 months) amazing fearful Canadians still are. think Canada 7 million dead thing much people still telling others live like April 2020.

That's say US right. pretty lax (especially without vaccine protection) interesting see difference.  Nobody listen anyway Yes, We’re talking holiday travel Christmas. reason every side effect likely second dose. Everyone know says first dose bad second dose knocked ass. Perhaps IV injections first dose less likely result myocarditis immune system trained respond yet. Yeah sounds normal. Australia right? lot countries managed pandemic late vaccine Low income people less likely washer/dryer. Coin ops expensive money time. can't put load go something else. Gotta pack kids (if single parent) sit stuff washes. Hopefully vehicle gotta haul transit too. Things already returned normal-ish lmao Yeah, seeing humans legs, roads, cars, bikes airplanes, worst all, *certain-kinds-not-to-be-mentioned-for-fear-of-message-deletion-on-this-nonsensical-subreddit* politics, central system horrendous error. winter... deaths surpass previous peaks combined, plan normal. culling dummies done yet. know this.    👏👏👏 mean wouldn’t issue testing personally. New moms nervous, that’s way it. years ago asking ppl get whooping cough boosters seeing baby. work pharmacy dispose doses twice day use vial. Better arm trash can. It’s unvaccinated heading hospitals. Covid forever, lo go state hospitals fine monitoring raw number cases irrelevant; you’ll exposed eventually. Lots people needed money. That’s available. Agreed, none advice been. would better didn’t going might want think trying this. really believe last year around holidays rapid tests could saved quite lives definitely medical bills. waiting pcr test acting cautious wait. 

I popped cvs picked box 2 tests way grandmas house kid runny nose felt little weather.  took one I.  covid wonderful visit. threw positive would turned right around. Even ardent denier doesn’t want see family members die covid heels dug want anything involves reporting anything.    fact need ask shows asking good faith What’s long term plan then? It’s either you’ll masking forever eventually accept taking mask Covid around. So... like Australia? Could easily necessary, sufficient. 

No reason hypothesis suspect doesn’t explain everything vax *does* fight transmission?  Oh, agreed. tried telling that.  delta strain genes help evade immune responses co-infect single host swap genes antigenic shift, producing strain contagious delta, ability evade vaccines immunity...

&amp;#x200B;

Not probable, far-fetched either... Meanwhile politicians attending parties. sibling asked test bc new baby, would. generally dislike kind thing. Ive using excuse avoid social interaction year great. two* going say thing, except use ""narrator, 'they didnt care'"" template 🤣 high exposure risk definitely get another dose 6 months, get single booster shot moderna pfizer. research complete agreement mRNA dose considerably vectored dose going increase immunity substantially. mean truthfully, rsv way dangerous babies. That’s probably enough reason keep baby home. Rsv really bad year NBA 2020 Bubble people flying internationally 10s thousands. delta wild. Apples oranges. Also used phrase ""was one of"" reason, never implied strictest. look Wuhan North Korea. Yeah disagree. mind hanging vaccinated people. 

The problem really like hanging family first place especially they're acting like anti-vax morons lol I'm happy see holidays again. It’s hard get test NYC hasn’t since first months pandemic. I’m wonder expects many people listen point thinks people expect say Behold, exactly predicted two comments ago: presented evidence makes uncomfortable, reject entirely don’t change behavior seek information.

I didn’t lead wasn’t planning bring all. don’t like using tiny bit anecdotal evidence, *shouldn’t* change mind. People looking data whole rather reinforces existing beliefs.  You’re kinda shit 🤷‍♂️ Mixing vaccines completely safe according research previous vaccination. Whether J&amp;J might cause severe side effects know. 65-year old second dose really quite valuable."
